"I stopped at the duty-free shopping at Cancun Airport and got three bars of chocolate, of the brand Maria Tepoztlan, one vanilla flavored, one dark chocolate and one with peanuts. Each bar was 11 USD. The chocolate was inedible. It tastes like hard wax flavored with chocolate. I am posting this to check if anybody else had a similar experience."
I've not tried that brand. The price you mentioned shocked me. I did a quick google and came across two articles by people having the same issues as you did. Question.. Is this an eating chocolate or is it possibly a cooking chocolate? Mexico produces several brands of cooking chocolate...that are very difficult to eat. They are designed to be used to make hot chocolate or to be used in sauces like mole.
"HI 103billwit does not say anything on the label , whether this is for cooking or just eating. I emailed the company and I am waiting to hear back from them. here is the website if you are curious. the chocolate is under products and then chocolate.  http://villavainilla.com.mx/"
"I emailed the company in Merida and here is their reply ( which is not very helpful ) : Villa Vainilla <info@villavainilla.com.mx> : thank you very much for your purchase! Our Xocolat its the original, ancestral and Nahuatl Chocolate recipe, for that reason taste completely different than a commercial American or European MILK chocolate (like Hersheys, Milkyway, Toblerone, Milka, Lindt, etc), our product its an historical experience because doesn't contains milk or other additional sweet flavors. Xocolat its Cacao (more than 70%), Sugar (25%) and regional species twist like vanilla, cinnamon, chili or peanut. Maybe its a bad stocks management of the retail.We were more than happy to change the product but unfortunately we are not able because USA costume doesn't permit delivery of natural products from Mexico. And money refund its not convenient because its a small transfer and you will pay more fees than the original aomunt. But be sure that during your next your next tip to Mexico you will receive a nice price from us!Best regards,Villa Vainilla"
"Based on their reply, I would guess that it's a matter of expectation/a cultural thing. There's a similar sort of situation with a confection sold in Holland called ""drop"" - it's licorice flavoured (seasoned?) with salt instead of sugar. The local kids go mad for it; I think it tastes absolutely vile and if you buy it expecting it to taste like what we know as licorice, you are in for a major disappointment.. To recoup some of your ""investment"", try melting the Xocolat down, adding something to sweeten it (syrup or a sweet liquer) and possibly adding a little whipping cream and using it as a fondue. (I'm thinking the addition of some cream might make it taste closer to the chocolate your palate is used to.)Hope this helps and good luck!"
"Thanks for the suggestion. Actually, the chocolate was beyond salvageable, so I had to get rid of it. it was old, and discolored. it was that bad. thanks All."
I have had exactly the same experience. I bought an over-priced ($13.50 for three small bars) pack of Maria Tepoztlan chocolate bars from Mexico City airport on November 13 and agree that the product is completely inedible.
"Chocolate, as many know, was originally made by the Aztecs (obviously in Mexico). This chocolate is authentic to Mexico and the origin chocolate (like mentioned on the back of the box) However, this brand makes its chocolate using 70% cacao, maybe if you are someone who does not eat too healthy (processed foods) the more bitter taste in this chocolate may seem strange to you...this is chocolate is suppose to taste like! Personally, I love the taste and the authenticity to it. I would recommend it to anyone."
"I just got back from Mexico 1 1/2 weeks ago and I also purchased the 3 pack of Maria Tepoztlan chocolate to bring home as gifts. We kept the milk chocolate and gave the dark and chilli ones away. We were wanting a piece of something sweet so we decided to try our bar of Milk after dinner one night. It was the worst chocolate we had ever eaten. It was waxy and had no flavour. My friend received the dark chocolate bar and I was there when she tried it and she took one bite and also stated it was the worst chocolate she had eaten. Although I believe that it might be old stock that the Cancun airport is selling, even old chocolate that is good chocolate, still tastes good. This is not the case with this. Old, waxy, not much flavour. Pass on purchasing chocolate at the Cancun airport."
"We just got from San Jose del Cabo and bought one with Chile, another vanilla. It's not expired, but has sandy-rough texture with lots of sugar. it's true that the only ingredients are cocoa and sugar, however, I doubt that it's 70% cocoa content, it tastes too weak for 70%, and we ate a lot of 70-85% cocoa chocolate in our life from different countries. It tastes more like not sophisticated 50% baking chocolate, extremely overpriced though."
"I bought the Maria Tepztlan chocolate last year and it was absolutely disgusting (and no, it's not because, as previous comment suggests, the chocolate is high cacao content lol!!). It tasted like gas/chemical, was extremely waxy. It didn't taste natural at all. The tin foil wrapper under the paper wrapper was literally dirty, with chocolate fingerprints from whomever was wrapping the chocolate. This was incredibly off-putting to say the least. I put some in my mouth and had to spit it out. It has lovely packaging, thus I'm sure it's getting all kinds of sales. It is not edible and I wouldn't be surprised if an analysis of contents found contents not suitable for human consumption. This is NOT just a matter of taste buds - it's a matter of human health."
"Just got back from Cancun . . . yes, the chocolate is expensive; yes, it is hard; yes, it is crunchy from the sugar. Actually I found this topic when searching for somewhere to buy the Maria Tepoztlan Vainilla Chocolate in the US. Our chocolate was not discolored, no dirty wrapper - just strong hard and flavorful chocolate."
"I bought a few bars of the dark chocolate at Cancun airport a few weeks ago. We just tried one with friends, and we all thought it was delicious. Great texture (it seemed like it had bits of cocoa beans in it) and a light cinnamon flavor. It's unfortunate so many people had such a bad experience. I agree that it was WAY overpriced (I paid $10/bar), but I thought it was great. I can also believe there's a lot of old stock sitting on the shelves, given that ridiculous price.I do not like Hersheys and other American chocolate. It's too sweet and has no flavor. My favorite chocolate is E. Guittard's Quetzlcoatl, (thesweethome.com/reviews/best-chocolate-bar/). YMMV."
Todays mexicans improved the recipe and buy La Abuelita at Chedraui for their hot cup of chocolateEdited: 6 years ago 
"A friend just brought me three bars of Maria Tepoztlan Chocolate from a duty free shop in Mexico and I am ecstatic! It is fresh and delicious! Both my taste buds and the ingredient list point to 70% cacao, natural vanilla and cinnamon (canela) along with sugar. I love the crunchy gritty texture - I can tell that real cacao beans and fresh cinnamon were coarsely ground into the recipe. Perhaps the others writing in have not tasted gourmet, hand made chocolates recently - all kinds of unexpected ingredients are being added to chocolate, including chile. To me, Hershey's tastes bland in comparison. Since the chocolate originated in Mexico and the Mexicans are using their ""ancestral recipe"" to craft this brand, I suggest that you broaden your opinion of what chocolate bars should taste like. Or if not, leave this delicious treat alone so that there is more for the Mexicans and people like me!"
Wow... Such vendetta over less than 20 dollar chocolate.. How much time is one going to take to create accounts and post paragraphs.
"I stumbled on this looking for this chocolate! I think it is the best dark chocolate! I can tell from the complaints, many people didn't understand they were buying flavored chocolates. For instance, the cinnamon chocolate has wonderful ground cinnamon that some have described as gritty. I think this chocolate is for true chocolate lovers."
"This is the best dark chocolate I've ever had. I believe many of the complaints about it are due to most Americans don't know what real chocolate tastes like. They are used to the Hershey type American chocolate, which Im not even sure has real chocolate in it. Also, I've heard complaints of a grittiness, that's ground cinnamon and is absolutely delicious in this chocolate. It's all a matter of preference, I guess. I personally find wine disgusting and many people have a hard time understanding that."
Right on! I love this chocolate : )
I'll take 3 bars of Milka for $11 any day. Takes me back to my childhood in Germany.
"Tried the Maria Tepotztlan chile chocalate that a co-worker brought back, and I agree that it is posibly the worst chocolate I have ever tried. Others have characterized the flavor as 'waxy', and that is completely accurate. I love spicy foods, I love a chile flavor, and I like my chocolate not-very-sweet, so I'm not convinced that the unusual spiciness or some 'cultural difference in sweetness' affected my decision. Quite simply, this chocolate is inedible and not worth purchasing at any price.Edited: 6 years ago "
"For my taste the Maria Tepoztlain chocolate is one of the best I had in Americas, beside Brazil.I have being in Cancun on May of 2014 year and returning back I had bought several bars of this chocolate in Cancun duty free store.The taste is chocolate straight forward and sandy texture, which quickly melts, adds some interesting feeling for sweet consumer.I don't know much about this brand, but for me there is a simple test, which I had read about a long ago: the melting point of cacao butter is very precise and it is around human body temperature. You can hold this chocolate in your hand for some time and it stays firm, but when only you put it in your mouth - it melts - hands are slightly colder than our mouth.The are no other ingredient with such precise melting temperature, which means for me that it is a pure cacao butter without any other not-needed ingredients.When I am back in Cancun I will buy this chocolate again."
"We bought this product at the airport in Mexico City last month. My girls (15 and 20 years old ) loved it and have asked me to buy more. We are chocoholics at our house but are picky. we have bought chocolates in many countries around the world and tend to like the stronger, less sweet chocolates. American tastes are more for sweet chocolates and makers of chocolates have been adding lecithin and other products to sell them in the US for our palates.My 15 year old usually gravitates toward milk chocolates ( she loves Neuhaus and Leonidas) but loved this one (Maria Tepoztlan chocolate xocolatl). I suspect those who were disappointed are those who have not yet really studied the different varieties of chocolates available in the world. I recommend a short course on chocolates and do a chocolate tasting party and taste the differences."
"your taste is very bad, because I try this marvellous chocolate after buying it in Cancun Airport and I want to buy again now and their site doesn't allow buying ..... alas"
I do not agree whit all that people who do not like your chocolates.... I love them and I would like to buy them again. Could you give me an adress where I may have them - in France or via ainternet site ? Thanks.
"Same here. We bought them as a gift for my sister in law. She opened them right away & we discovered that they were inedible. They were stale & nasty. Also, had a spicy taste to them, but not good at all. I was embarrassed & disappointed. They were not cheap at all! I could've bought other brands that we knew better. But we opted to buy the Mexican brand, after all, we were bringing a gift back from Mexico!! We purchased in the Cancun airport as well."
"Interesting, we purchased the 7oz large bar labeled ""Tequila"" at the Cancun airport and my wife and I agree its some of the tastiest chocolate we've ever had. Maybe there are some bad batches floating around... It WAS grossly overpriced though I'll agree."
"We recently bought a bar of MT chocolate and it was really good. Not sure if things have changed/upgraded since your initial post. We bought our bar in Cozumel Mexio close to the port in 2014 and it's one of the tastiest chocolate we've encountered. I'm partial to bittersweet chocolate. this bar is not milk chocolate like a hershey bar. More like semi-sweet and smooth with a bit of crunch bit that i'm assuming are cocoa beans. Better than a hershey bar. Maybe this company has gotten better after the first reviews? If you're looking at this chocolate and it's 2014, give it an honest try!"
"The first time I bought Maria Tepoztlan chocolate it was amazing. I loved the taste of the slightly refined cacao and sugar, including the grit and small crunchy bean pieces. It tasted much closer to natural cacao than anything else I've had.That was April 2013 at the Mexico City airport. It's now January 2015 and I recently bought another one. This one tastes like everything in the duty-free shop mixed together; it tastes old. However, it's expiration date is 04/16. I'm not sure what to make of this as the first one was excellent."
"Anch'io ho comprato all'aeroporto di Cancun il cioccolato di Maria Tepozlan, per l'esattezza il tipo ""CHILI"" (al peperoncino). Era veramente ottimo ed ero entrato nel sito per vedere se potevo comprarne on line.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Yes...I bought 3 bars as gifts..I bought one that was supposed to be 70% Cocoa, it was gross and really sweet...how can anything that's 70% be that sweet? It wasn't a high quality chocolate AT ALL...in fact it was practically disgusting.Really disappointed."
"My parents bought this for us and we just tried it and it was quite original, we quite liked the gritty taste with no bad after taste.. and as our flavour was Tequila we expected some sort of alcohol or as some people said ""fuel"" taste in it.. there wasnt really much but it was still good.It is definitely over priced though, it's more for the experience though.The packaging was alright, I did see two finger prints on the wrapping, but it was wrapped well."
"THANK YOU, I just finished the chocolate bar I bought in Cancun and was looking for more online. I've come across nothing but negative comments.. Personally, I love those little crunchy bits of cocoa. The flavour is decadent Maria Tepoztlan chocolate is above and beyond any super market chocolate in Canada or the US."

The chocolate I am always trying to find are the Britt Chocolates. The chocolate covered fruits and nuts. I just love them. Always hard to find. Did find some at the airport last trip.
"This chocolate is *not* 70% cocoa, this is fraud."
"I think it is a wonderful chocolate. I got one with coffee. The ingiridents are very true to stated on the box. I am on gluten free milk free diet and I had no reaction to this chocolate. Belissimo! I've tried many chocolates (including Belgium which I had terrible reaction, my native russian, including super dark) and you have allergy to milk protein (not lactose intolerance) you can hardly find any chocolate (only Trader Joe's dark cholocate works). Most chocolates are contaminated by wheat or milk. I love it, I wish I've got more. Wonderful taste.You simply might of expect something different.Edited: 4 years ago "
"I bought a package with assorted flavored chocolates from Cozumel's duty free shop recently. While I didn't hate them, I would not buy that brand again."
Certainly splitting opinion this one
"I bought the chili flavoured one yesterday upon flying back to Denmark, and I'm so disappointed! Not only has it got a sickening smell of vanilla (which I absolutely loathe!), it also taste nothing at all like chili, and even though it says 70% cocoa on the package the taste is just too sweet and bland 0:sThumbs down!"
I bought a variety pack in Janurary at the Mexico Airport. I loved each flavor. It's the only dark chocolate that I've really enjoyed eating. I loved the texture too. Maybe you had a bad batch?
I purchased Maria Tepoztlan chocolate in Puerto Vallarta. It was the Tequila flavor in a yellow wrap. I thought it had an amazing flavor. Different from Hershey for sure. It had no liquor content but was sweetened with agave syrup. The bar was quite solid and heavy with a hint of crunch. I wish I could find it here at home!
"I love love love this chocolate. I had the vanilla, chili, and dark chocolate at a friends yesterday and am online to order some. The vanilla is absolutely exquisite. It's not a mouthful of sugar, so don't expect sweet. The vanilla comes through beautifully and is wonderfully aromatic in your mouth.Love it!"
"I have had this chocolate and found it to be delicious. As the company itself responded to one traveler, its NOT American type chocolate and its not supposed to taste like it. Most of its products don't contain milk which alters the taste very much right there. Absolutely love this stuff. Not cloyingly sweet like American junk food chocolate."

"Too bad I am finding this too late. I purchased (on 3/14/16) one large candy bar, 2 sample boxes & 2 LARGE portions of chocolate/caramel fudge. I brought back to co-workers and not one person liked it. I spent $50 on candy in the airport, because I wanted Authentic Mexican treats. Wish I would've bought more of the Swiss Tobelrone that was on sale buy 2 get one free. And I love dark chocolate. It was the texture - almost powdery.Edited: 4 years ago "
I had a similar experience. One bar with coffe and another w/chiliI both with tremendous (word in vogue) amount of sweet. Inedible as they are. No comparison to those of ki’XOCOLATL. They are fabulous.
"I bought these as gifts several years ago, gave them out, and only later tried one myself. Well beyond its expiration point and completely dis colored and inedible. It was rather mortifying. I would never purchase chocolate from the duty-free at CUN again."
"I just bought two bars in April 2016 and they were the most delicious chocolates I have ever tasted. Different people like different things- I like dark, spicy chocolates with rich flavors. Perhaps you purchased and expired batch?"
"Yep, this stuff is not good at all. We got suckered by the ""buy 3 get one free"" sale at the Cabo airport (@ $11 each). My 17 year-old also bought the Smarties ($7) and Haribo Color-Rado travel edition ($5.50) and both were a MUCH better deal. Don't do it."
My family and I think it is delicious! It's a shame some people are so narrow minded. The flavor is exquisite and we love the crunch. I stumbled upon these reviews while looking to see if I could get it from Amazon or so.
In theEdited: 4 years ago 
Thanks for the heads up. I'm at the airport next week and will make sure I don't purchase.
"Wish I had seen this before I purchased a Maria Tepoztlan dark chocolate bar from CUN for $11. I love dark chocolate and regularly eat 70%, 85% and 90% and so I was fully expecting this chocolate to be bitter tasting. It wasn't the bitterness or texture of this chocolate so much as the waxy/chemical aftertaste that made it completely inedible for me. Package indicates it's not expired, but the bar itself was covered in a white film. Either it's a bad batch, or I've just never had cinnamon in my dark chocolate before and didn't realize I don't like it. I'm just glad that I didn't buy the three bars to get the fourth free!"
"The problem with this chocolate IS NOT the high cocoa content or the flavors added. Buy this chocolate if you need a bar of soap or candle wax perhaps. I've had genuine chocolate, and it does not taste like this. This chocolate made me vomit and I would never recommend it to anyone."
My friend just brought a bar of this Maria Tepoztlan chocolate back from Mexico for me and I absolutely love it! It has a trace of cinnamon and the chocolate is scrumptious! I wish I could buy it in the U.S.
I was also looking where I could buy it from and stumbled on these reviews. I think it is scrumptious. If anyone finds out where to buy it online please post the site.
"I totally agree. This is some of the best chocolate I've found. The use of real cacao gives the bar an interesting depth of flavor and texture. If you're looking for a Hershey Bar, this isn't it. This is a grown up candy bar for the discerning palate."
I got some in Mazatlan on my trip there and its lovely. Id agree that its not a Hershey's but when compared to organic chocolate bars it this brand is great. In my Vanilla bar there was some flecks of cocoa nibs but it wasnt bad. id buy it again if i could find it locally
"I have been reading all the negative reviews to my astonishment. I thought the chocolate bar which I had was out of this world. Better than any European chocolate I've ever had. As a matter of fact, I searched google to see if I would be able to order this in the future since I find it so delicious. I am not a big fan of sweets but thought this was great & had a small piece for the past 4 nights."
from what i've read its because most people expect hersheys or lidnt chocolate bars when buying something that is supposed to be chocolate the way it was made by the aztecs.
I agree. didn't like it.
Couldn't agree more with the positive comments on this terrific chocolate. I came to the site to find out where I could replenish my stash without returning to Mexico. Can't believe it is not made for export.
"You cannot compare this chocolate with commercial chocolate bars. Look at the list of ingredients and you will understand. This is good chocolate, better than Hershey's or Cadbury and even Lindt. It is pure ! Not filled with lot of sugar and what not. We bought many different flavours and it was delicious."
2 bars of this. $22 wasted. Johnny rockets is a rip off too
i got it for $11.50 from the airport and am pissed i didn't get more. I love it so much and found this post when googling to see if i can buy it online. lol
right!!!! the ingredients are pure and simple. i'm so annoyed i didnt buy more.
right!!!! the ingredients are pure and simple. i'm so annoyed i didnt buy more. i found this post the same way. now i know to buy loads when i go back lol
Sadly I agree. I’m a chocolate fanatic and have eaten chocolate from around the world. This tasted like soap.
"And by the way, ignore the condescending comments that those who do not like it are somehow uninformed or simpletons. I am a chocolate fanatic and buy high end gourmet chocolate worldwide, I tossed this after two squares. Not only does it have soapy undertones while it’s in your mouth, but the aftertaste is disgusting, almost metallic. I had the pure bar, 70%, and am thankful I didn’t waste more money."
"This chocolate is crap. I posted a similar thread years ago. I bought a pile of it to give as gifts and some for myself. Imagine my mortification after handing it out to friends to open 3 bars that tasted like chalk and were fully discolored. If they were ever good, they were expired by the time I purchased them and/or had not been stored properly. I've had chocolate purchased fresh from Maison du Chocolate in Paris and from chocolatiers in Belgium. This chocolate is a poor quality tourist rip off."
"Agreed, awful! will write to company. we spent $45. on the chocolate.Edited: 2 years ago "
"You have terrible taste in chocolate. It's delicious. Or maybe I'm drunk,"
Just returned from Mexico and I also purchase 3 of these candy bars. The packaging is nice but that's about all. It was like biting into a block of wax with.
I also purchased 3 bars of this stuff and agree its inedible. It was like biting into a block of wax with a soap fragrance/taste. Kind of like a candle...yuck!!
This chocolate taste like 99/100 sugar ! It’s not healthy at all !
"MY parents bought me this chocolate while on vacation in Mexico and it is one of the best chocolates I've ever eaten. I have traveled to many countries and tried many varieties of chocolate; this is a favorite. I will say, the texture and flavor take a certain palette (perhaps), but I have actually restricted how much of this chocolate I eat at once because I'm trying to savor it as I don't seem to be able to purchase it online. Sad, so sad!If anyone has a link where I can purchase the Maria Tepoztlan chocolate, please do share. I would gladly pay the regular price plus shipping for this pleasure."
I got my three bars of Maris Tepoztlan Chocolate in the duty free shop in the Costa Rica Airport in San Jose. I just went on line to see if I could mail order it. I thought is to be the creamiest and tastiest chocolate I have ever had and I love my chocolate!!
"Whaaaaat? We LOVE this chocolate! We also bought it at the airport. I actually found your post because I googled ""maria tepoztlan chocolate"" because I'm trying to find out where I can buy more of this online. Before we left Mexico my husband kept talking about wanting to buy some Mexican chocolate. I had no idea what the difference is. He finally found some in the airport and we bought a few packs, and it's the Maria Tepoztlan chocolate. When I tried it I realized why he loves Mexican chocolate--it's a very different flavor and texture. Very rich and thick. It's Aztec chocolate, which is where chocolate originated. It feels more raw but so flavorful. I think the waxy thing you are talking about is the grainy texture. We've been back for 2 months and still have some left and we're savoring the last bit. Which is why I'm trying to find where I can buy more online. Pleeeease bring this to Amazon!"
"Total, utter garbage. I have eaten many single origin chocolates, high % (72-100%) regularly for >5 years, and there is NO way that Maria tepoztlan is 70%. I figure the reason that it isn’t sold in US is the the truth in labeling laws would prevent it from being sold as such. There is no way their chocolate would even come close to a bar of Lindt, Theo, Divine, chocolove ."
"I bought two bars at the Cancun Airport last week hoping to give them as gifts to a few people at work. I wanted to look up the chocolate online just to see if it was available in the U.S. and found the posts here about people hating it. This made me open a bar to test it, which means I spent $11 on a gift that I can't give anymore. The chocolate was very good and had the traditional cinnamon flavoring and grit of real cocoa nibs in it. I didn't expect it to taste like Hershey chocolate, which is pure junk to me. Yes, it doesn't contain the milk solids and corn syrup fillers that cheap American chocolate contains which is why it doesn't taste like American chocolate. Yes, I do love rich chocolate made with milk and creme. If you are looking for that flavor, don't buy Mexican chocolate."
"Yes I agree, it is the worst chocolate you can buy, I think it was put in the duty-free store to stick it to the Americans. They sure got my son., he had picked it up there for me because he knows how much I love chocolate,, But if you eat this chocolate, you will never want chocolate again.  Thank God for Belgian and Swiss chocolate."
Oh how I wish I had seen this before I bought FIVE bars!! Worst chocolate ever...Every different flavour tasted the same as the next. I complained but I guess they got my money so why should they care that they sell garbage?
Sorry to hear
Just terrible. Inedible. I can't beleive they still sell it at the Duty Free (bought it at the airport in Mexico City) 5 YEARS LATER. Simply unbeleivable.
Yes just did the same thing and it’s terrible!
"I even wrote to the Duty Free Shop to explain and complain, but never got any reply. I'm travelling back to MXC next week, so I'll complain personally, for anyone willing to listen. And no, I'm no fan of Hersheys, of course. I'm a chocolate lover, a real chocolate lover... but this is garbage."
"Bought a box at the Puerto Vallarta airport and think it's terrific. A very different taste from American or Belgian chocolates, but really good. I like the smoky aftertaste,"
"Same. Its just incredible. Though I only bought two bars, at 12 each. 24 bucks thrown to the trash can. I complained yo the Duty Free shop and never got a reply. They just don't care. I'flying to Mexico this week so I'll complain personally. A shame."
"They are not supposed to be for cooking, and I wouldn't use them with that purpose either."
"I also bought one dark and one vanilla bar at the duty free in MEX airport. I saved them a couple weeks until I got a good opportunity to taste the real xocolatl. It was the most disappointing experience I ever had with chocolate in my life. The vanilla bar was cloyingly sweet and barely resembled chocolate. The 70% cocoa bar was even worse. It packed so much cinnamon and sugar that it tasted similar to toilet soap. This is not chocolate nor xocolatl, it’s a candy to fool tourists who seek a milenar experience. Definitely a waste of money."
Perfect description! I had the same experience of trying to eat soap.Edited: 1 year ago

Thanks! I almost purchased a $12 bar in a duty-free shop in Cozumel.
"I got it as a souvenir gift from my family and absolutely loved this chocolate. Read all the responses and really shocked to find out that so many people had such bad experience with that chocolate. It's a hard chocolate, not soft but it's really good."
"We recently bought some of the Maria Tepoztlan chocolate bars, and I have to say that we do like the one that has a subtle taste of cinnamon. The texture is definitely different from American and European chocolates, but we enjoy that little bit of crunch of the ground cacao beans. We're eager to try the others (coffee, coconut, and Caribbean salt) and we will buy more when we get back to Mexico."
Lol...more one hit wonders who work for the company resurrecting a long dormant thread to say they just love this awful chocolate and real posters saying it’s crap. Buyer beware!
Reviewer I was thinking the same thing. This is definitely a one time posters thread. Lol
Did you know it is a chocolate that supposed to be used to make milk chocolate?
"Just came from Cancún, bougth the same chocalate a i had the same opinion than most of you. Absolutely horrible pure fat no flavour, horrible. I wouldn´t recommend anybody to buy it. What I wonder is Why the airports from the country where cacao was born sell such product! definitly they are not making a point."
"OMG, a Mexican friend gave this to me, knowing I'm a big chocolate connoisseur. I came here looking for reviews and found this thread. I consider Hershey's too disgusting to buy. But this is worse!"

"I think there is definitely “a certain gene” that makes the various one post wonders allegedly like this chocolate (like cilantro). It’s the same gene that draws them to work for this disreputable company and make covert advertising posts. Oh wait, that’s not genetics...just bad character."
Completely agree. A disaster of Chocolat
I bought and ate the coconut one and I adored it!!! Now that it is finished I am looking to buy it in the UK but cannot find it. I really really love it and want to try all flavours now!
"I have an interesting take on this from some so called chocolate experts. Even so, food is so personal and regional. My friend is an executive in the hospitality industry in USA and bought some for her colleagues who work in luxury food and beverage and/or hotels here. These are all people who have traveled the world and experienced or work in Michelin star restaurants, gourmet foods, etc, etc..... They all universally said the chocolate was bad.... I know they have chosen chocolates in the past which were praised and very expensive for their work. I tasted these smooth belgium/swiss style chocolates with exotic flavors and very much enjoyed them. Those guys all have a very European taste palette and know what their customers want. It's understandable/you have to please the customers.With this in mind, I enjoyed the Maria Tepoztlan brand also after I realized what they are doing. This stuff is less processed and more raw, clean tasting and feels closer to nature. The one I tried was vanilla flavored and had cocoa nibs in the base, a nice chocolate taste and just enough sweetness from the agave to balance with a very clean finish. It was a little waxy and gritty, but I think this simply has to do with the amount of processing/mixing and oil/fat content. There was no lingering creamy/oily european chocolate after taste. So for that reason, it could be thought of as the original flavor and superior in some ways."
"We just got back from Guanajuato last night and picked up a 200 gm bar for $13.00 at the BJX airport. I love dark chocolate and have gone on wine/chocolate and bourbon/chocolate tours. This chocolate is 70% cocoa, I have eaten and enjoyed 85% and 90% cocoa. The inability to eat this has nothing to do with the percent of cocoa. I don't know if this is old but it has a lot of white on the outside, extremely waxy and the texture and flavor is awful. I had to spit it out. I would not waste my time trying to make this into an edible cooked food or beverage."
"Unfortunately, I bought 3 bars of the 70% cinnamon tasted. It's really incredibly bad... The worst chocolate ever! I felt sick after eating a small piece. Poison!"
It doesn't have milk but it has lecithin and sugar. Disgusting! Congratulations for making the worst chocolate in the world!
I can confirm your experience. We bought this incredibly expensive chocolate at the airport. And it tastes worse than 15% chocolates that were sold in the Central and Eastern Europe during the communism period...
We purchased a box of these chocolates at Cancun duty free. The taste reminded me of chocolates back in the Soviet Union. There was no good product and kids Like me were happily gobbling up that garbage. This is not a cultural experience. This is a scam. It is a cheapest crap you can produce with margarine and other inedible ingredients. It sticks to your mouth like frozen butter and make you want to vomit.
"Same experience. Bought the 70% Cacao one in Cancun Airport for $11. Although not expired, it appeared quite old (had a bit of a while color). Almost no chocolate taste, just feels sugary and waxy and a bit disgusting. I love dark chocolate, usually eat as dark as possible, but this is nothing comparable with a normal chocolate taste."
"I bought this chocolate in the Cancun airport to bring a gift to my coworkers after my vacations. Unfortunately the chocolate was not good, the taste is very oily, didn't taste like chocolate... all tried all 4 different flavors and all have the same oily taste."
Agreed. Totally inedible. Purchased at the Puerto Vallarta airport in Jan 2020.
Totally!! This chocolates are the worst but really expensive. I bought boxes of different flavors for my family and friends. Never again...
Well. Sadly. I am reporting 6 years later and confirming that this chocolate is still inedible. :(
"We bought 3 bars of Maria Tepoztlan dark chocolate and 1 bar of vanilla at the duty free shop in CDMX in February 2020. We intended it as gifts for friends. Luckily for them we decided to try the dark chocolate when we got home before gifting our friends. It was horrible!! We both instantly agreed after trying one bite. A cautious second bite was not one bit better. It has an indescribably bad taste, which is somewhat soapy and unfortunately lingers in your mouth. Have no idea how it could be so bad, yet apparently so widely sold. We would not recommend this chocolate to anyone. Caveat emptor!"
What! You kept it for 6 years?? You are a glutton for punishment.
