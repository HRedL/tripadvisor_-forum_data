"As of Friday at noon, local authorities are enforcing a 1 person per scooter or motorcycle rule. As of now, no restrictions regarding number of passengers per car.https:/…"
Well that doesn't make any sense does it?
Good luck with that one.....
"It will keep the police busy, that is for sure!"
I don't envy the police trying to get people to stay home.
Here's a link to the story in English. Also talks about how the Mayor cancelled all public transportation in the island. No more combis. https:/…2020.html
"Thanks for posting, Joan. I looked at Riviera Maya News early today but nothing yet. The English version is always best here.Happy to see they stopped the colectivos. Think the same should be done everywhere. Hard to observe social distancing when packed into a colectivo."
"They could save a lot more lives by just enforcing traffic laws. You know, stupid stuff like, stopping at a stop sign, having an operable head and taillight at night. And my favorite....having your helmet strap snapped in place."
Here's a translated version regarding the suspension of public transportation:https://translate.google.com/translate…
"Just wondering, if a couple who lives together is allowed to share a house and a bed, why not a scooter? And if one is driving a scooter to buy groceries, who is carrying the bags on the scooter on the way home?"
Good questions. But no one says the government puts much thought into their actions.
"Terri, to cut down on people moving around, in general.Floorboard would be my first guess, they are pros at it, followed by, maybe front basket, or saddlebags."
"They are pros are carrying much on scooters. Sometimes the wife , kids and a pet. Well, that was before they started doing a better job on law enforcement.Of course, most locals here have normally shopped on a daily basis and not at supermarkets. So not really that much to carry."
"IMO people on Cozumel will adapt and do things differently just like everybody else in the world. Things we aren't doing anymore: driving a car, shopping everyday, shopping at the same store we used to, paying bills the same way we used to, picking up meds like we used to.....EVERYTHING! Lots of times they don't even need their scooter. It's just what they're used to having. We're doing EVERYTHING different now."
Good to know it just isnt our Govt thats lost their minds. Stupidity is universal I guess.
"Maybe stupidity isnt the right word . maybe over reach , like writing tickets to fishman at the boat docks in Detroit if they have two or more people in the same boat or truck that dont have the same address . Isnt the masses at the local Rural King/Lowes / Home Depot more important than two dudes going fishing ? SMH sorry for the hi jack . Its just crazy ."
"The latest on motos. I tried to copy/paste the article, but its all in CAPS, and TA doesnt allow that. 5AM-10AM. Two riders allowed, provided its for work(dropoff) or medicine. Documentation required.10AM-3PM. One rider only, documentation required.3PM-7PM. Two riders allowed, for work dropoff or medicines. Doc required.7PM-Curfew.

"I dont usually get my news from commercial facebook pages but hers is copied from the Cozumel Government website for those who want to see the official notice. The changes are good since some do rely on the scooters for dropping off and picking up people from work. According to friends, they are stopping those with two to verify the reason for the trip."
It doesn't make sense if they don't stop cars also!
"Many many more cars than motos, they can control the cars easier. Ive seen roadblocks where they check everyone. May or may not be warning cars too, I cant hear what they are saying. I could find out, if I thought it was important enough.Like I just told a guy whining over there on C4Review. ""Be part of the solution""...and quit yer whining.(I didnt tell him that in public)."
"I am not so sure there were many many more cars than motos on the island. You're likely regulating the Motos more strictly since that is what the average local uses rather than a car which few can afford.Sometimes the police set up a Moto checkpoint very near to where I live it's entertaining to watch. They are checking for driver's license and current registration. If either are missing, they load the moto onto a truck and send the occupant off walking."
"Robert thanks for correcting me. More motos than cars, of course."
Duffer wish I could find the actual numbers. I have seen them before and an astounding number of motor vehicles for the relatively small population. Always a challenge for local law enforcement.
The estimated numbers were in one of my Cozumel4You newsletters a while back.Unfortunately those figures have since exited my cranium.
"That is my problem , many things frequently exit my cranium. I don't recall where I saw the figures but I don't look at Cozumel4You so can be sure it wasn't there."
