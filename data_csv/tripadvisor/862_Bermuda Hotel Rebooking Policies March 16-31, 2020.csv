Just got word from someone in the know that all hotels are closing until April 1st mandatory.
"just cancelled our reservations at FSH. This was to be our 23rd visit to the island, sigh..."
Please confirm with source.
Please see Royal Gazette today 3/18/2020 in regards to hotels. My source's may have jumped the gun a little early but it seems that it is happening with many hotels.
">>>...My source's may have jumped the gun a little early...<<<Whether all, most or some...it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that rapidly emptying hotels would close given the developing situation. There's an old adage in the Bermuda tourism book: ""..When the US sneezes; Bermuda catches cold.."". For decades this maxim has been just a clever allegory for economic downturns. These days Bermuda is doin' her level best to keep this from becoming literal fact."
"Rosedon, Elbow Beach, and Cambridge Beaches are closing :-("
