Love and virtual hugs to you all."
Thanks for sharing these videos. Tho' tissues are still in short supply on the shop shelves here and I just went through a few more from my one remaining box watching those.

"Post 31 has 2 links with 24 quips.—-One Office of the Light Touch Division deals with a very personal subject. That’s right:Phones. **In these troubled times, people don’t like to talk about a particularly-sensitive travel topic: the opportunity to misplace our phone. There: I said it.SO: if you have a Tile phone-finder, or a dog with a nose for it, here are 7 ways to find your phone when your battery (or your dog) runs out;1. Always wear a shirt, or a skirt, or both, and put the phone in your pocket. (Showers don’t count, because the water makes too much noise anyway.)2. Set your alarm every 12 hours. If you lose it, the phone goes off anyway.3. Ask your neighbor to call you.4. Make friends, and maybe they’ll call you (often within a week).5. Wait 20 minutes. A solicitor will call you with an offer you-won’t-wanna-miss. But you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, and you can put your phone in your shirt (after it stops ringing).5. Don’t ever leave your condo, or your house if you have one. (Then: where else could it be!)6. Get another tile battery.7. Don’t lose it the next time.Things are pretty daunting now, but sometimes progress comes one wrong number at a time.Edited: 11:18 am, March 30, 2020 "

Of course not to be outdone in trying to create fake news Trump's campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh tried to blame the whole thing on Joe Biden. So they are going to get upset about what some comedian does but then their official campaign is going to lie about a political opponent and I guess that is all ok?  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house…
"***Tim Murtaugh tried to blame the whole thing on Joe Biden.***Key word, appeared, not ""blame"" as you suggest:""Murtaugh then appeared to blame Trump's Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, for the video.""If this is Joe Biden’s idea of helping the country through a crisis, he’s better off just staying in his basement,” he said.""Fact is that it was fake news."

"Thanks Risa, that WAS lovely; so meditative and relaxing. But I jolted out of my serenity at 4 minutes, the view out Robyn's window is my neighborhood. That's the church spire, the huge crane and the facade of a 19th century building that are all less than 5 minutes from my home. (The rest of the 19th Century building was knocked down for a supermarket (my supermarket!) in the 1980s; lots of demonstrations that, unfortunately, couldn't save the building, The facade is now the front of the roof top parking lot.)"
For those with Netflix there is a new seinfeld standup special out called 23 hours to kill.
Oh thanks Red. I've got a whole lot of netflix to catch up so I am planning to subscribe for just one month and binge. But have to wait till my uni assignment is finished towards the end of this month.
"@218 Netflix has a ton of stuff on it. Ozark is back on netflix with a new season and if you haven't seen the crown I would recommend it, since its pretty entertaining although to be honest other than seeing the queen once in person I didn't know much about her background early on so it was mostly new to me and maybe more entertaining as a result since I didnt know what was going to happen for a lot of it. I may signup for a free 7 day trial of disney+ to binge the mandalorian, which I have been told is pretty entertaining."
I saw the first two series of The Crown and loved it. But I'm going to pass on the 3rd Series because of the change of actors and I lived through the years it covers (and much of our media is enthralled by the English royal family. Should that be Royal Family?
https://watch.mhzchoice.com/ is an interesting subscription source - foreign language so you have to be in the mood to read subtitles if you're the typical monolingual AmericanI particularly enjoyed the German comedy Crime Scene Cleaner
@220 the actors that took over were of the same caliber as the actors from the other seasons. Took a little getting used to but they did a good job. The third season I found to be a bit more on the personal behind the doors level for a number of the episodes vs more heavily historical events that are reported on. Some of the biggest events arent even covered like Princess Ann's attempted kidnapping.
Like seriously? I'm not even sure I was that fit at 18 let alone going on to 71.https:/…

"@kaye, I had a Mouse Trap game when I was a kid. I loved it. And a Frustration Ball. Those were fun times.On another thread, there was a discussion of possible UV therapies for Covid 19. I immediately flashed (pun intended) to my UK 80's sojourn. Tanning beds were hugely popular and I made use of them along with everyone else. Sigh.The image stuck with me. And so I offer a snippet of a very famous ballad by Jim Steinman, first sung by Pandora's Box...re-written for now.There were moments of violet whitish powerful light...These were things I'd never do again, but then it surely was right...There were hours upon a subbed, that were more than present recs allow...Baby, baby, baby...If I walk through like thisAnd if the light shines like thatIt's so hard to recallBut it's all coming back again now...I'd best head to work...before I get out my Duran Duran LP (the original black vinyl!)"
Loved that video linked in #269. And I also loved my Mouse Trap game! We usually didn't play the game. We just set it all up and let it go.
"I loved Mousetrap. The last time a friend’s father drove before they took the keys away, he was involved in a chain reaction accident at a gas station that involved a truck, a lurch, an overhead door, a car being worked on, a lift and a mechanic’s toolbox. The only way we ever described it to other people was by saying it was a real-life version of Mousetrap. That video was great."
