"Hi,My girlfriend and I have plane and hotel tickets to stay in Moscow from 2nd-5th May (and then onto St. Petersburg). However, I have seen lots of media reports that we would be forced to self isolate for 14 days, which would not be possible.Is there any official reports or sources confirming this please? We will have to make plans to go straight St. Petersburg in that case!Many thanks :)"
> My girlfriend and I have plane and hotel tickets to stay in Moscow from 2nd-5th MayNo one on this planet can possibly know what the situation is going to be two months from now.
"Hi Jamie:There are lots of reports, but you have to be careful with their content. The one official document (in Russian) that I can find only mentions Russian citizens, and not tourists. When asked about tourists, the head of Moscow’s health department, Alexey Khripun, more or less deflected the issue. The links, with a translated relevant part, are immediately below:-----------------https:/…12-YM.pdf'2.3. Comply with the regulations of sanitary doctors about being in isolation mode at home.3. Oblige citizens who arrived from the people's Republic of China, Republic Of Korea, Italian Republic, Islamic Republic Of Iran, French Republic, Federal Republic Of Germany, The Kingdom of Spain, as well as other States with disadvantaged the situation with the spread of a new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV).....in addition to the measures provided for in paragraph 2 of this decree, provide self-isolation at home for a period of 14 days from the date of return to Russian Federation (do not attend work, study, minimize visiting public places).'-----------------------------'Meanwhile, there were simpler questions, such as how the measure would apply to tourists, family members and pets. The head of Moscow’s health department, Alexey Khripun, suggested the simplest solution was for Russians and others to simply stay put.'https:/…russia-ramps-response-coronavirus--------------------------------I suggest that you read post # 20 (landstrykere) at the link below for recent information and a balanced view in a changing situation. Today is Sunday, and Women's Day - there should be new information on official websites early in the week.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g298484…Good luck.Edited: 7:49 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Thanks for this latest...indeed, the latest reports in Western media state that Russia has already implemented for tourists the 14 day “stay in hotel” rule for US...in addition to the obvious suspects (now including also France and Germany.At the same time, having visited many official Russian sites (the one said to have issued the latest order for the US...the Russian Consumer Supervisory Agency) and so far, have not found a definitive doc...I am however pessimistic...and also wondering when airlines and hotels will send TARGETED message to folks they KNOW are affected to cancel trips or risk “being locked in hotel room”...not sure how that works if one has a 10-14 trip with several cities, or what good the lock-up does it one hops in the Aeroexpress and then Metro...Time will tell I guess..."
My husband and I flew into Moscow today from London - we had heard reports of the UK possibly being on the list of countries from which arrivals would be asked to self-isolate but we relied only on official Foreign Office advice which said the UK was not on the list. We had no problems arriving into Moscow. I can only suggest you rely on official information from your country’s equivalent of the Foreign Office and as others have said the situation is changing daily so you just have to keep up to date.
"Thanks Rosie!I don't know from where and how these media reports pop-up,creates a lot of panic/anxiety (that's the media's job anyways - unfortunately).Like you suggested,the best thing to do is to probably call the Local Russian consulate on the day of travel and confirm if any restriction is imposed."
THE UK government have just confirmed the coronavirus quarantine in Moscow does not apply to the UK at present
"Not much comfort for UK travelers...given the US has had ""only"" maybe 400 cases (due to low testing), the UK won't be far behind, and the countries added to the list, NOW also including France and Germany, suggest it is likely maybe a matter more of days than weeks or months...Edited: 1:20 pm, March 08, 2020 "
">>We had no problems arriving into Moscow.<<This is very good information Rosie. Thanks.Did you see anything at the airport (maybe even outside) concerning passengers from other flights? Such as people being questioned, handed forms, temperature taken, taken aside, etc. Any signs in English, for example, telling people to report to a particular location, any medical people in masks, even? Anything obvious that some people were having trouble entering Russia because of coronavirus? Any announcements on the plane before you landed?"
"As for waiting for your HOME authorities to alert you to such things, would agree one can check first...BUT, this thing just popped up for us in the US about a day ago...and we are hearing a lot right here...and do not think the official government sites here are keeping up well with this since we have our hands full here...most they seem to advise on is advice simply not to travel abroad...vs. ""administrative"" measures we are hearing about here, which have less to do with OUR health and more to do with whether one can even ENTER a country or might be effectively locked up once one does..."
"No - the airport staff were wearing masks but apart from that you wouldn’t know there was anything going on. The British Airways staff at Heathrow asked if we had travelled to China or elsewhere in the last two weeks but as we hadn’t, this wasn’t an issue."
"""2nd-5th May""Every traveler is going to have to make up their mind about their travel plans, and unless you are travelling tomorrow, the following might be some sobering stats that highlight the speed at which the situation is changing haven taken figures on the 6th of March and the 9th of March.In 3 days there have been 11,600 new cases, only 273 from China and over 8,000 in Europe.Cases in Italy have doubled to 7,373, now overtaking South Korea to be second behind China.US cases have more than doubled, now at 484 up from 209.Switzerland has trebled from 118 to 337, even the UK has doubled from 116 to 273.This is what has happened in just 3 days, with the Lombardy region in Italy in full lock down.Europe is now in the grips of full community spread, it is beyond containment, the US is an evolving situation with a similar view it has entered a community spread phase having been undetected for some weeks.Expect those nations that are geographically isolated or have hard borders to further limit entry. Small Island nations like Samoa will only allow entry from ANY foreign country to travelers presenting a doctors certificate of health no older than 3 days, Pacific and Caribbean, even Asian Cruise Ships are finding it impossible to find ports that will allow them to berth and disembark."
"“Like you suggested,the best thing to do is to probably call the Local Russian consulate on the day of travel...”Well, good luck calling the Russian consulate. On another note. St. Petersburg cancelled its economic forum in May. It’s a financial loss to the city in millions and millions of dollars. If they took that step, clearly invasion travel limitations in the future.Edited: 6:39 am, March 09, 2020 "
*they envision travel limitations
"Watching my Russian-origin news for further word...right now, since these are done for RUSSIA, no special details on tourists...also, still trying to find the exact words of the decision by the agency said to have dictated these measures...the Russian Consumer Protection Agency...but not seeing the actual publication on their site...it does appear to be quite “early” on there, maybe similar to the US 2-3 weeks ago when our fearless leader adopted the “don’t worry, be hqppy” policy...Russia has done exactly the opposite."
