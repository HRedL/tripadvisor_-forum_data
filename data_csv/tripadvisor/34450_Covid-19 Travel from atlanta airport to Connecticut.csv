"I am asking for a friend whose repatriation flight is landing in Atlanta. He needs to get to Connecticut. Whats is the safest mode of travel with least exposure to covid19. Rent a car and drive to Connecticut, involves stopping for gas and food and overnight hotel? Or domestic flight from Atlanta to Hartford or westchester airport and uber home? Anyone travel recently through these airports?"
"I can't speak to Hartford, but the pics I've seen of ATL are like a ghost town. You could play baseball in the atrium. Likewise, most reports of flights say very few passengers."
"Hartsifeld's baggage claim was a ghost town when I returned on 3/11. That's when I knew things were going bad, fast.Fewer germs? Probably renting a car and driving. Fewer hands touching things.More comfortable trip? Second flight. I washed my hands before boarding and as soon as I got off the plane. Used wipes to wipe down the hard surfaces at my seat and tried not to touch fabric with my hands. I'd probably wear a mask or bandana now on the plane.No clear answer as to what's the best."
"Hope your friend gets home safe...not so sure a ""repatriated"" person coming from an area that no doubt has the virus is not more danger to others than the reverse. Given they just got off a plane I would just get on another one (if possible) and given no one is flying wipe things down and get home to quarantine."
We are repatriating to Connecticut via Delta into Atlanta. Coming from an area that has literally only 2 positive cases and we have been in lockdown for a month. If we fly out of Atlanta to Hartford we will not make the connection in one day. Wondering if we should stay overnight if so what hotels at the airport are open?
"The Marriott is connected to the airport via the Sky Train. Here's the link -https:/…There's a Covid 19 warning as to who is qualified to stay there. I would contact the hotel for more information/ clarification. ""Customers should review government guidance to confirm eligibility to travel & stay at hotel. See travelguidance.marriott.com. Reservations will not be honored where prohibited."""
The airport website www.atl.com may give hotel info. I would check Marriott Gateway first for easier access.

"Saba, Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean it is not on a ""do not enter"" list and the Humanitarian Repatriation flight is organized by the US Consulate in Curacao and they would not arrange anything that was against US policy!"
"Good to know Both question posts were very vague.The only hotel (that I know of) that offers a shuttle from the International Terminal is this one -https://www.kimptonoverlandhotel.com/But they have a temporary suspension of operations due to Covid 19.I would contact the Marriott Gateway and confirm with them before booking.Actually, why isn't the consulate making the hotel arrangements or booking different flights that will not require a layover?"" and the Humanitarian Repatriation flight is organized by the US Consulate in Curacao and they would not arrange anything that was against US policy!""Edited: 5:08 pm, May 02, 2020 "
