"Booking.com appear to be running a criminal scam to avoid refunding customers whose accommodation bookings fell during covid19 lockdown in the UK and European countries. Under force majeure regulations they should offer a refund to customers who were unable to travel due to government regulations. The scam involves offering customers the opportunity to cancel but you are required to confirm that you understand the cancellation will cost you the full amount of the booking. Obviously customers won't do this. So booking.com put the customers down as no show and the booking is cancelled by the hotel. This apparently means the booking isn't covered by force majeure and no refund will be made. So customers are damned if they do and damned if they don't. They are definitely not acting within the spirit of the law.If anyone else has been conned by these people in the same way, try chargeback on your credit or debit card. Remember to refuse a voucher first so they can't claim you've accepted an alternative form of refund."
Was this a non-refundable room rate that you wanted to get a refund on?
It was non refundable but that's irrelevant due to force majeure because of coronavirus. The UK government has said that customers should receive refunds for any accommodation they booked that could not be used due to coronavirus lockdown in both UK and France.
Tarquinus AIUI there is no such rule for foreign hotel bookingsonly flights and package tours
booking.com ordered hotels to refund under Force Majuere long before the UK lockdownhttps://partner.booking.com/en-us/help/legal…
"@nzentenaClearly booking.com must have changed the web page to which you are referring since your post. That must be part of the scam. Now it is stating that booking.com are ""asking"" (not ""ordering"") hotels. Furthermore, refunding is only one of the three options, the other ones being issued a voucher or having the stay rescheduled at possibly a different rate. @Tarquinus,since you had a non-refundable booking, who charged your card - booking.com or the accommodation provider? My impression from past threads about booking.com is that they have little power over the accommodation providers which are their only source of income (as fees for booked and successfully completed stays). I.e. if an accommodation provider has your money and does not want to give it back, booking.com has about no leverage to force a different outcome."
"Actually they state""We ask that you—to the satisfaction of the guest""Which means the options are upto the guest and not the hotel."
"The key word is ‘ask’. It is still a request, not a directive. But yes, I understand it has changed and additionally a date range was also implemented Booking.com have little legal standing to enforce a refund, it is still entirely at the discretion of the hotel. Whilst the majority are sympathetic/understanding of the situation and have worked with guests to come to an amicable solution, not all have adhered to that course of action.As for whether there are legal options available, that will be determined by the relevant laws in that location.Regardless, it’s a silly statement to imply this is a scam orchestrated by Booking.comEdited: 5:05 pm, May 10, 2020 "
Late add>>>So booking.com put the customers down as no show and the booking is cancelled by the hotel<<<Booking.com can’t amend the reservation status to No Show. This can only be done by the hotel through the extranet - they won’t been accept that in writing or phone call.
"There is always a gamble when buying a restrictive rate plan that should plans change, for what ever the reason, you may not be able to make changes without penalty. That is the trade off between flexibility and a discounted cheaper price. A gamble in some respects.I expect many in the hospitality sector are struggling and perhaps are having to take tough commercial decisions to remain in business for the future. They may wish to ideally refund non-refundable sales but don’t have financial ability to do so. That is why so many offer credit for future use or a split on the loss. The other side’s view point also needs to be taken into account.If the hotelier does not wish to cooperate with the request to refund the charge on your non-refundable room then a claim from your travel insurance would be appropriate. Ultimately that is one reason you buy it."
Booking.com are nothing more than a advertisement all refund changes needs to be by the hotel
"This is a clause from booking.com's website regulations to its partner hotels. Seems to suggest otherwise.... A reservation was canceled due to a Force Majeure event. In these cases, guests shouldn't incur any costs or fees for stays they couldn't complete. Booking.com waives all commission on these associatedreservations."
Booking.com is also known for making 5 Billion profit in 2019 while asking the state to pay their loans in 2020.

"Tarquinus, the wording you've copied is still not a directive as shown by the word 'shouldn't'. BDC have no power to force hotels to do anything. All they can do is to ask and advise.I don't know what legislation you referred to in your first couple of posts. Would you be kind enough to link to them?"
