"Sarwa, the same for the person who died in Semarang in Java. They suspected Coronavirus but after she died they said it was not Covid-19. and they buried her wrapped in plastic. She had returned from Spain via the middle east. Let's hope Indonesia's good record continues."

Bird Flu in human is definitely Lower Infection Respiratory Tract, so is more severe than Upper Infection Respiratory Tract. Usually get Lower Infection Respiratory Tract get also Upper Infection Respiratory Tract. But the person get Common Human Flu, as patient in Batam.Indonesia very aware about viruses, so hope there are no one will be infected.

It is different with previous Wuhan evacuation, so the standard becomes higher and higher."
