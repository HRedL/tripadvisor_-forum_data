"Hi all Waiting for reply from my insurance and wondered what others have been told.I very luckily renewed annual policies on 26/2/20 for policy starting 6/6/20 for 365 days - maxed out on cover because corona was rumbling and we had TC cancel two holidays last year, one on day of travel. (we did get all money back without insurance claim)I am hoping all trips booked prior to renewal are covered for this year?I assume if I wanted to take a credit note and rebook for later (March - within this insurance cover period) I wouldn't be covered for corona but would be for anything else?Do you think in the next few months when things start to open up, Insurance co's, travel agents or destinations with set up an add on or levy to cover us? otherwise no one can go anywhere."
"I think you’ll need, unfortunately, to check with them. Hopefully it will be straightforward to check - mine has this scenario laid out on their website. I have seen some that still cover you if you rebook the same holiday for later but not if you take the credit note with a view to rebooking later. Does that make sense? And FWIW I anticipate the industry will sort itself out so that people can keep booking - less sure about just what for the ‘sorting itself out’ will take."
"As Maldiva says check with your insurer before taking a credit note or date change.If they class it as a new booking, rather than a change to an existing booking, current clauses may come in to effect.So for example many policies will not cover bookings made when there is FCO advice against travel to the destination. If this is the case with your policy, then your original booking is covered because it took place before the FCO advice. Any new booking would not be covered whilst the FCO ""do not travel"" advice is in place. Therefore should they class vouchers/date change as a new booking, they may argue they aren't covered.Their interpretation may or may not be reasonable. Perhaps you'd win if you took it to the FOS/court. But thats hassle you probably don't want, particularly given lead times are very long for those routes right now."
We had the renewal letter yesterday for our annual policy. As expected Coronavirus is no longer covered but there are two more changes too. Cover is no longer given for failure of an airline or that of a tour operator. It looks like they are frightened of the likelihood of so many going out of business.
We think we will wait (and hope) for the Tui Costa Rica trip to be cancelled.I think they them give an ATOL backed credit note which can be used if insurance becomes available or cashed if not.We have trip to Marsa Alam booked for October - I thing that is far enough away time wise to hope.The travel firms / holiday locations will have to sort it or none of us can travel at all.So sad.
The insurance exclusions going forward are my main worry :(Leaves you with only the S75 route and then you have to be careful there's not an intermediary processor between you :/
It's not the cancellation or needing to be brought home because that should be ok with ATOL so I'll book packages BUT the medical cover.I do think a solution will arise because to have any travel it will have to.
Insurance companies aren’t in the business of paying out they are profit making businesses controlled by shareholders.I agree the medical issue is probably the biggest concern as the costs of treatment / repatriation are enormous.If it was your business would you offer cover?As for cancellations refunds I strongly advise against taking a voucher especially if it has a years time limit there are too many unknowns and it is doubtful that you will get refund on vouchers from credit card companies etc. Many Airlines and travel companies will inevitably go out of business so make sure you get a refund as soon as possible.As to time lines we are in this for the long term especially if you consider this worldwide it will Be around for at the very least another 18 Monts.The only sensible option at this point is to holiday in your own country if that becomes an option again my best guess is that won’t be possible for at least another 5-6 months
"""Insurance companies aren’t in the business of paying out they are profit making businesses controlled by shareholders.""Paying out does not equal no profit, in fact quite the opposite. If insurance companies refused to indemnify because they may have to payout, then no one would ever take out insurance.Right now the actuarial calculation is difficult, because of the lack of reliable data. So yes SARs-COV-2 may be around for 18 months, or perhaps even prove to be endemic, but reliable data on risk will be available long before that.At which point the insurance actuarials will run their models and set premiums at the level which ensures despite payouts the underwriter will make a profit (within an acceptable level of confidence). They are only concerned with profit, not payouts.Edited: 10:23 am, May 15, 2020 "
