"Just got lots of mosquito stings/bites on St. Thomas during the day, wondering what the actual status is as on the VI Official government page the last update was in 2014. Had used bug spray with deet but apparently missed a few spots. Thanks."
"Chikungunya and dengue will always be around but the chikungunya ""epidemic"" is long over which is why there have been no updates. I don't think you can reasonably expect to remain totally unbitten but contracting either virus is a long shot and I wouldn't be overly concerned about it."
Thanks. I always seem to get the stuff that is a longshot though for example the swine flu a few years ago. But your post makes me feel better thanks.
"Just in case, is the hospital here well equipped to handle the cases or do I need to fly to Miami?"
"There isn't much they can do at any hospital if you happen to get either. Most people who have had either are sick for about a week to ten days and they get over it. Some people have symptoms for longer, but most people I know who have had either just suffer through it (stay in bed) until they feel better. Certainly not a fun virus, but thankfully, most people come through it fine. Symptoms usually pop up 3-7 days after the infecting bite."
"Yes but there's no ""cure"" for either and you just have to live it out. I know scores of people who contracted chikungunya when it was epidemic here and none was hospitalized. The chances of your contracting it are wildly minimal."
Would I be too sick to fly? Our flights are on Thursday.
If you have no symptoms and haven't been diagnosed why are you anticipating any problem? Locals and visitors are bitten all the time and VERY rarely have anything to be concerned about other than the itching. No idea what else to say to set your mind at rest! Settle down and enjoy the rest of your vacation.Edited: 4 years ago 
Hypochondria. Thanks for the reassuring words.
"Forget Chikungunya and Dengue, Zika is the new one and it's in Puerto Rico..... (!). Lol"
"Yep and they are all carried by the same mosquito which bites during the DAY, so people need to protect themselves then as well as dawn and dusk."

"My pregnant wife and I are booked for a few days in early Feb at the Marriott Frenchman's cove.Normally we would take the chance with the mosquitoes, but now that we are 16 weeks pregnant we don't know what to do. This will probably be the only chance to take a vacation for a long while, however we don't want to risk affecting the baby! What is the mosquito situation really like right now? What are the chances of contracting chikugunya and zika viruses?"

"I was very worried when I was on St. Thomas but it seems nothing happened. At the beach areas where you will be, there is normally a constant wind which seems to keep the bugs away. Also, we used ""Off"" and that worked. I was stung only 4 times and we were there for three weeks."
"Oh, the only places we were stung were in the changing rooms/bathrooms at the beaches and one time in a restaurant bathroom. But in those places you will see them, so maybe take the spray with you when you go into such places (if you don't want to spray on yourself because of baby concerns) and spray the room before going in or only spray yourself at such times. I stupidly took my chances which is why I was stung."
Did just however see warnings on TV news advising pregnant people to be cautious because of Zika.
"amp3d: There is no way anyone can predict this for you, but the zika virus is a very real risk for pregnant women. Others who contract it just get sick. The CDC has issued a travel warning for Puerto Rico where there has been a case. To date there have been no cases of it in the USVI. This is the CDC warning:…cdc.gov/travel/…zika-virus-puerto-ricoIf you decide to go make sure you adequately protect yourself from bites not just by using insect repellenant with DEET (not great for pregnant women I know) and by covering up. These mosquitoes bite during the day as well. I am by no means someone who panics or would consider canceling a trip in most circumstances, but this is a serious situation for pregnant women so if it were me, I would probably go somewhere else in this case. The reason I say that is because although the risk of contracting the disease may be very low, if you do, the result could potentially be very bad and much worse than a non-pregnant person contracting it. In Brazil they are actually telling people to avoid getting pregnant because of this virus and the huge rise in birth defects because of it. The other thing is you would probably spend the entire time worrying about it which is not very relaxing either."
"The CDC has issued a level 2 (out of 3) travel advisory for the Carribean. We will be canceling the trip, because even though there is no reported case in St Thomas, Puerto Rico is close enough. And to Saffie's point we will be worried and thinking about it the whole time, which will not be enjoyable."
"Personally, I think you made the right decision. Hopefully you will be able to go somewhere else. Best of luck!"
