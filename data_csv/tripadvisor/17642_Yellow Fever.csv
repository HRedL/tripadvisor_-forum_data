"I will be spending 3 days in Iquitos, do I need to get a yellow fever shot?"
Its not a requirement for visiting but it is reccomended for that area!
"By the books recommended but probably not necessary. I'm also going to Iquitos/Tahuayo and seems there hasnt' been a YF case (and not in a tourist) in quite a while, but it is always a possibility.I will save Qwovadis the posting of the link if he actually reads this. mdtravelhealth.com/destinations/…4Iquitos is in Loreto Department, Maynas Province. However I assume you are going beyond Iquitos to one of the lodges or on a cruise?If you are going onward to certain other countries such as Brazil you may need to produce the certificate."
"This is the information I found :The risk for infection for South America is highest during the rainy season (January–May, with a peak incidence in February and March). Given the high level of viremia in humans and the widespread distribution of Ae. aegypti in many towns and cities, South America is at risk for a large-scale urban epidemic.So, its your decision.I have yellow fever immunization for the last 40 years, the vaccine is good for 10 years.Have you taken a polio vaccine ? Have you heard of any cases in the past 20 years ?"
www.mdtravelhealth.com Peru correct CDC suggested not required...not currently epidemic anywhere in your areaIf you cross a border in SA from Peru it is requiredYF unheard of in a 3 day visit just use repellent you will be fine...
"Also, if you are 60+ years of age or have other health issues it is not recommended. The risk of severe side effects from the vaccine is higher in older people, and probably higher than the risk of contracting the disease if you use other precautions. Note the age limit is decreased from the prior advice of 65+. If there was an actual outbreak the advice might be different. Basically they want you vaccinated so you don't bring it into another country."
