"Chicago will move to phase four of reopening from the coronavirus this Friday along with the rest of the state, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Monday.https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
Supposedly beaches are opening 7/6.
Seems like great news! Only downside is many other places that have moved to the next phases may end up having to back track due to people not observing the social distancing.
"JB,That's no downside to Illinois. Those places (Texas, Florida) have not required masks, while Illinois has done so since the initial lockdown back in March, and continues to do so. We don't recommend or suggest masks, we require them, for when social distancing is difficult. Positivity rate of testing is still around 3%."
Those states denied there was a problem and opened too early with no restrictions. I just hope their residents stay put. Another reason we shouldn't open any tourist attractions.
"We need to close our borders like NY, NJ and CTB."
"Yup, not only has mask-wearing been optional -- and only sporadically practiced -- in the states experiencing the biggest spikes currently (TX, AZ, SC, FL), unlike Illinois, those states had been allowing occupancy of 50 or 75% in bars & restaurants. Chicago's phase 4 caps restaurant & bar occupancy at 25% (or 50 people, whichever is less). But I hope we don't get complacent. I am worried about the risk of spikes from increased drinking & socializing in bars. Just remember the St Patrick's Day revelry, when citizens were being encouraged to social-distance but there was no legal compulsion to do so."
"I agree with you, MBA. And ""requiring"" people from states with high infection rates to self-quarantine for 14 days, like NY, NJ and CT announced, sounds great in theory but there's no enforcement mechanism. It's not like they will be fitted with ankle monitors on arrival."
Nationwide mandatory masking needs to be the norm. The virus has no borders. That’s the only way to beat this. It’s worked in other countries.
"Phase four of Illinois’s COVID-19 reopening: Settle in, folks, we may be here a whilehttps://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
FYI - in the UK to enforce mandatory quarantine you have to tell them where you will be and then they do random spot checks. IF you are not where you told them you would be it is a 1000 pound fine. Certainly not perfect but motivational to stay put.B.
"No way to do that here with so many road entry points. Read the Hawaii forum -they are serious about their quarantine -hotels give out single-use keycards, so if you leave, you can’t get back in without going to the dream. And everyone landing at the airport signs papers detailing the quarantine. People have been charged criminally, some have been turned in by residents seeing their social media posts."
My friend recently went to her house in HI. The police have stopped by to make sure she's home and a neighbor is constantly spying on her.
"Yeah, it works on islands, not here with land borders."
That's why I think we should keep tourist sites closed. Everyone that lives here can survive not going to a museum or observation deck in 2020.
"Maybe open to members and residents only? Hard choice to make, as otherwise it means even more jobs lost."
"""We don't recommend or suggest masks, we require them""Good to hear! I think Texas and Florida were thinking the heat would kill the virus but obviously that was wrong."
