"I just heard from my contact at the Palace that because of low occupancy, they close one restaurant per night. Oriental is closed Fridays, Italian is closed Tuesdays, El Mercado is closed Sunday & Fridas is closed Sunday. Will report more when I get there on Sunday. Any others who are there, do you have any other info?"
Most Resorts will do something similar in the slow season.
"Yes - I know the Riu's do - and without any warning but Palace never did to my knowledge - and we were there during the swine flu ""epidemic""!"
Excellence does as well
