"Rocky, not as easy as it looks. Our travel agent was on hold with Air Canada for 3 days straight, 8.5 hrs each day to move up our departure date. I guess travel agents can’t book a third party one way ticket home. So, being not so computer literate, we enlisted the help of someone to help us book online. It took 5 attempts before we finally got a confirmation. We are flying out Monday, two weeks ahead of schedule. Total cost for a one way ticket home to Ottawa for two $2,360, more than we paid for our original fare here ( both ways). That doesn’t include the $75 dollar cancellation fee as this fellow put my friends middle name in wrong, so wasn’t matching his passport info, so, cancelled and rebooked. We even went to the airport yesterday to see if we could change our original booking, book a one way ticket home or fly standby. They don’t do any bookings there. By the way airport was not busy, but only 10 am. So, with all that being said, good luck to those trying to get back home. If we can’t get reimbursed by Air Canada we purchased trip cancellation insurance."

"We check prices on line and our agents prices have been no different than online prices. She has gone over and above for us over the years. She will , as on previous issues with Airlines, go to bat for us in getting reimbursed for our unforeseen costs. I’ll prefer the security of booking with a travel agent any day than booking on line.a different generation."
