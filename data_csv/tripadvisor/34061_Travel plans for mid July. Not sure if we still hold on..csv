We'll be staying in St Johns at the Westin. Haven't booked our flights yet. Although flight prices are still the same.What are services like on STT/SJ? We wanted to go snorkeling and zip lining. Does the island have different Covid rules than the mainland? Will tourist services and restaurants be open this summer?Would love some insight.thanks!
"When you ask about a comparison to “the mainland” which of the 48 mainland states are you referring to?My guess is you’ll find the rules on St John in July to be on the “more stringent” end of the spectrum.Suffice to say, it’s a fair bet that your trip will be nothing like you were expecting when you booked it."
"thanks. We were there last year. IN any case, coming from California. We'll be monitoring the news and government sites for travel issues. Just wanted to see if there was more insight here.thanks"
"I doubt anyone knows what July will be like. I think now hotels and villas are not allowed to take visitors and restaurants, like most places, are closed. beaches seem open from the posts here. I think July will depend on whether things improve with COVID."
"The Governor will decide by latest June 1 whether or not to continue the ban on managers/owners of vacation rentals accepting reservations from visitors.Restaurants are currently open only for take-out, bars are closed, face masks must be worn in all public buildings and social distancing is to be observed everywhere including on the beaches.Incoming passengers by air and sea are having their temperatures checked and are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.The zipline and all tourist attractions including sail charter operations are currently closed.What will or won't be open in July is anybody's wild guess at this point.You can follow latest developments here:https://www.facebook.com/GovernmentHouseUSVI/"
"Our April/May trip was cancelled. We're hoping things will be back to normal soon, but our next booked trip isn't until mid-Nov/Dec. We have all our fingers & toes crossed that visitors will be allowed to return soon. We miss our friends. Everyone, STAY SAFE. Social distance. I'm amazed at how many people don't wear mask, don't practice social distancing, etc, etc. I only go out for groceries. Our son came over yesterday for Mother's Day, but he stayed at least 6 ft away. Didn't get to hug him. His wife has an 'essential' job and has to go to work everyday & has the chance of getting infected.This really sucks!!!!"
I wouldn't cancel. Wait until after the June 1st announcement from the USVI government before making your decision. Everything could be up and running reasonably well in July and it could be the best trip of your lives with light crowds and business owners happy to have at least some business back.
We are also due to visit late July into August. Waiting to see Governor’s decision on 6/1. As much as we are anxious to return even if the Governor opens up USVI territory not sure if we will travel. We canceled our Texas trip for later this month and my feeling is that things will take sometime to return to “normal.”
"Yes wait it out , or book your flight with the option to reschedule, we live in Florida some beaches are open hotels in Orlando are open and so are the pools with social distancing.. It really could be a light crowd for you , which is not bad for the islands we will all have to wait and see"
We booked AGES ago for 8/26 not realizing it was hurricane season. I'm still hoping we can go but my friend is convinced we'll be cancelled. AA isn't showing any seats on the flight from MIA to STT at this point (I discovered this when I went to upgrade myself).
This thread caused me to go back and check on our July trip with AA. Good thing because the flight down there is GONE! Poof! No notice or mention of it ever existing. Just the return flight. Crazy!I check on our upcoming flights every week or two and last week it was there. This week it's disappeared. Not exactly sure how to approach a flight that disappeared without any notice. Guess it will require a call to them despite the request to not call.
Theres no reason not to open June 1st at this point. What happens between June 1 and mid July as far as outbreak is anyone’s guess! I hear the Westin has plenty of guests booked for the first week of June. Unless there’s an outbreak you will be able to go to restaurants and book charter boats. No BVI’s.
"No one can assure a traveler during the beginning of June that ""You will be able to go to Restaurants"" unless you mean to pick up food to go .until our Governor issues the guidelines and timing of the next phase of opening only changing the restriction on visitors accommodations have been mentioned."

"Nor is June 1 a ""go"" for lifting the visitor accommodation restriction. It remains a tentative date. Given the news from stateside and worldwide about rapidly increasing confirmed cases directly attributable to re-openings and NOT related to more testing, and given our community's particular vulnerability I do not think that right now there's ""no reason not to open June 1st"" but every reason to exercise extreme caution."
Delta seems to be canceling a ton of flights for the entire month of June from LGA and JFK. I was told that flights that are labeled “Sold Out” are actually flights that are in the process of being canceled. Perplexing.
If we move to “open doors” phase June 1sf then all businesses would be open including bars and restaurants. How they manage that with social distancing and face coverings I have no idea. Charter boats are already running for locals and are taking reservations for June 1 for travelers. https://www.covid19usvi.com/current-status
"Allowing the islands to be ""opened"" for tourism June 1 would be a really, really bad thing. Wait and see. Be careful what you wish for."
"TIMM... How do you know it will be really really bad? It all might work out OK too, but you gotta try sometime."
Booked mid July trip. Coming to support the island.
"Snorkeler; outside of the original ""hot spots"", we are still climbing toward the peak in a LOT of the country. How do you keep those people from traveling? The fact that a person is most contagious just prior to feeling any symptoms (if they even feel symptoms), is a bit of a problem. Checking temperature won't catch these folks. How do you propose to keep the islands from having an outbreak if they allow tourists in two weeks?"
"Possibly maintaining some of the restrictions and requirements in parallel with opening up condo/villa rentals for a period? Masks required in grocery and public areas, maintain strict social distancing at beaches/public areas, and continue limiting restaurants to take-out only, for first 3-4 weeks. Closely monitor case numbers and lift restrictions gradually. Add in hotels / resorts after it's shown the virus spread can remain repressed with increased numbers in villas/condos.Not ideal for businesses or tourists, and some number of folks would likely choose not to visit until after all restrictions are lifted. But that's actually good rather than the scenario of everyone returning to the island at once, out and about every night."
"""It all might work out OK too, but you gotta try sometime."" Easy to toss that out so blithely when you don't live here, nor do you live in a place which sees a constant flow of thousands upon thousands of tourists from all over the country and the world and has very limited medical facilities to accommodate any sort of a major outbreak. The Governor is carefully weighing all the pros and cons."
"TIMM, ct summed it up well. I think the governor of usvi seems to be doing a good job, but you do have to try at some point to open back up, not speaking blithely at all.The world will never be free of pathogens and we have to take a risk, assess outcome, and alter course if needed. This is low season and many don’t want to travel, flights are fewer, so the number of visitors will be way less than a normal high season. I think it is a good time to try.US total cases have been on the decline over the past few weeks, even with increasing to plateauing testing, so that is a good sign, but we also have to remember, it is the number of hospitalizations that matter and those are way down!"
"I don't know how to seriously respond to that without coming off snarky. I'll just say that I very much disagree, and think that things are moving at least a few weeks too soon. Not exactly a time that I want to be proven correct. Ah so it go."
"<< “ US total cases have been on the decline over the past few weeks,“ >>There are two problems with that line of thinking.The first is a mathematical artifact related to the nature of a logarithmic growth function within a population of fixed carrying capacity. You can visit KhanAcademy.org if you want the calculus lesson, but suffice to say that “a decrease in the rate of increase” is not only inevitable mathematically... but still represents a net increase.Second issue is the fact that growth rates in places like NY and NJ were so absurdly high and, still growing rapidly, a few weeks ago, such that when those rates begin to revert to anything lower... it makes the US number as a whole “look” like it’s coming down. Yes, in fact the growth rate of new cases has come down — mathematically — but only from a catastrophic level to an alarming level. And, as mentioned above, it’s still a net increase in new cases.The growth rates in places like NY, NJ, Massachusetts have began to come down. But they are still recording new cases every day. (My father-in-law joined that number yesterday.) But even so, there are still great swaths of the US where the growth rate is still increasing. California, the most populous US state, is still on the increase. As is Illinois, Florida, Arizona, All, in fact, are growing even faster than any model predicted."
"TIMMMAAY....not sure I understand? Do you think we shouldn't open for travelers, until all restrictions can be effectively removed? I get that opening with restrictions is certainly not ideal from a business perspective for the island, but wouldn't a slower roll/implementation be prudent from a public health perspective? It seems like it would be much easier to roll back and course correct than if cases surge with even a staged implementation, rather than with a full frontal assault back to the island at once?"
"""Do you think we shouldn't open for travelers, until all restrictions can be effectively removed? ""If by ""we"" you mean the USVI, I'd like to butt in with a response from a local perspective. I have no problem with the island re-opening to visitors if we're able to check incoming passengers sufficiently to ensure within reason that they're not bringing into the territory this highly contagious virus.This is not yet possible."
"CT, I'm in agreement with STRes above, but would go a bit further. Until at least the majority of the US mainland is legitimately a few weeks into a genuine ""downslope"" - for lack of a better term - I think it's a very foolish proposition. A lot of the country is still in the rapid growth phase. Do you really think all of those folks will just willingly sit tight if ""allowed"" to travel? I do not. And if even a few sick people land on island, it could get really ugly, and you won't know until it's too late to bring under control. As I said previously in this thread; I think ""we"" are moving at least a few weeks too soon. But that's a moving target based on how everyone manages their own behaviors. Here in Michigan that isn't going great. Then you have states like Georgia who have already opened theaters, while their infection rate continued climbing. Yes I think it's a bad idea."
"The country is NOT still in ""rapid growth"". That's simple untrue. Daily cases have declined after peaking on April 6th and that's even with MORE testing. Let's be truthful and not spread misinformation designed to scare people.https:/…cases-in-us.html"
"From the CDC - May 8th. As you can see - all in DECLINE, NOT ""rapid growth"".The national percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at public health, clinical and commercial laboratories decreased from week 17 to week 18. Percentages by type of laboratory:Public health laboratories – decreased from 17.7% during week 17 to 13.2% during week 18;Clinical laboratories – decreased from 10.3% during week 17 to 9.0% during week 18;Commercial laboratories – decreased from 15.9% during week 17 to 13.2% during week 18.Edited: 10:49 am, May 14, 2020 "
"Yes, let's be truthful and not cherry pick and mis-use data to fit an agenda. You're using nationwide data, which says what it does because the major hot spots of NY, NJ, Detroit Metro, etc are indeed on the downward slope, which skews the national numbers. There are absolutely, verifiable pockets of the country where cases are rapidly expanding. People live in those areas too, and those same people travel. Anyhow, the bad faith arguments are really tiring. At this point everyone basically believes what they will. Don't know why I continue to try to break through to some people. Wait and see.edit: it would be GREAT if people either accurately read what is written, and/or argue in good faith. To blatantly twist someone's words is dishonest, extremely rude, and serves no purpose but to confound reality. Stop doing that, okay?Edited: 10:58 am, May 14, 2020 "
"Wrong again. You are still spreading misformation.As of yesterday, ALL states, including hotspots like NYC, are on a DOWNWARD trend, except for WY which has ONE new case. NONE are in a ""period of rapid growth"" as you claimed. That couldn't be more wrong.See graphs, state by state below.https://rt.live/…"
"First, your tone is very nasty, Susan. I have tried to remain respectful, but if you want to act this way I can as well. You are still arguing in bad faith, but you probably can't help it. Maybe you don't know any better. One more time; I did say ""states"", or ""the country"", I said areas of the country. This isn't difficult, but you seem to want it to be for some reason. Let's take Michigan for example, as that's where I live. The main population center is indeed on the ""downslope"", and since that is, you know, where most of the people live, the state numbers look pretty good from a thousand feet. Until you get down into the weeds and start breaking down the numbers. The western areas of the state are on the upswing, but since they don't have the population of Detroit Metro area it doesn't skew the statewide numbers by much.That same thing is happening across the country, whether you choose to accept it or not. I don't know what else to say to someone like you. Do you want me to go state by state, county by county? Because I have a feeling that even if I took the time to do that, you would still come back with some nonsense mental gymnastic bs.Like, when Anthony Fauci spoke to the Senate committee a couple days ago, and said the same exact thing, was he lying? I'd really like an intellectually honest response to this part at least.Edited: 11:40 am, May 14, 2020 "
"You can check actual figures by state here (updated daily) https:/…and also bear in mind that we are only just on the tip of the two weeks incubation period of those states which reopened - and those are already showing an uptick. Same thing happening worldwide where countries which have started to reopen are immediately showing a sharp uptick in confirmed cases which are DIRECTLY related to reopening and not to additional testing. And many of those countries are concerned enough that they've already backpedaled on the reopenings.Again, this is something that the USVI simply cannot afford to play around with given our particular circumstances and logistics when the six deaths we've already had are directly connected to visitor contact and travel.We totally understand that you want to come back and enjoy the islands and of course we need to see things regain some degree of normalcy because our whole economy depends on tourism. But our little community (this ain't Kansas) can't afford the risk of ""oh, open up and wait and see"". I find it hard to believe that some people just don't get it. Hawaii is doing it right with MANDATORY quarantine ..."
"Susan, thank you for trying to spread facts and not fear. You and Snorkeler are much-appreciated voices of reason. Yes caution is still indicated. I’m sure the USVI Governor will use all available facts and guidance to make any decisions for the islands, whatever those might end up being."
"LOL""facts""""reason"" Wow, you guys. It's seriously like we live on different planets. I can think of only one or two reasons for that, and both pertain to where you source your ""news"". I will just say that I don't get mine from any network, period. I look at actual data, not what some person talking to a camera wants me to believe. Some people really need to work on their critical thinking skills. Or, here's a thought. Try to counter my points with actual, pertinent data, not platitudes. Come on, people."
"The NYT interactive maps and charts are useful to illustrate this. Click on ""hot spots"" above the main map to see which areas are just simmering at a reduced rate and which ones are at a rapid boil. You can dig in further to a county-by-county resolution, and there are little graphs showing which counties are still approaching their peaks.Cases are expected to be at a low growth right now, as we've all been as isolated as we could manage for the past weeks. A better test will be the same charts three weeks from now, once some states like GA/TX have been partially re-opened for a month and other states have pried open their businesses by militant action. https:/…"

"I've refrained from posting on this topic, in large part because I'm not sure the debate is mine to have as a ""mere tourist."" I'm respectful of the viewpoints on both sides, but particularly those of locals and residents who are concerned about the fragile healthcare system.However, I'd respectfully ask a question -- and it's one I'm not sure I can answer for myself in my own home, so I won't even begin to try to form a viewpoint about the USVI. But here's the question: At what point DOES the economic impact begin to matter more than the public health threat? I feel like that has to be a moving target, simply because the longer the economic impact lasts, the more likely it is that the economic impact ITSELF becomes a public health threat. I have to believe that USVI residents whose income depends on tourism are at least more likely to find themselves sliding more to the ""economic"" end of the scale vs. the ""public health"" end. A very well-known STJ retiree has written a letter to the governor urging the island to close its doors to tourists until after hurricane season. But with all due respect to that particular viewpoint, would the person feel the same way if he were 35 years old trying to make a living, as opposed to 60-70 years old living on a pension?At one point, it was easy to say that people's health mattered more than economic impact. I myself certainly felt (and still feel) that way. But there's going to come a point for all of us when that starts to swing the other way -- not because we care more about our vacations than we do about people's lives, but because people's lives are being taken away from them by restrictions placed upon them in the name of the public good. Anyway, I just raise this question. I don't pretend to have the answers."
"Deacs, that's entirely fair, and raises good points. I don't know the answer, but I do agree that it is a moving target. However; looking at the raw data (I know I keep using that word), I see no way that NOW is the right time, no matter the economic effect. A second shut down would be catastrophic."
"Different planet is right. One of which raises people with manners and the ability to disagree with people with being condescending and insulting, and the other of which apparently does not. Also, I don’t get my news from ANY network. Nice try though. Let’s try to get this conversation back on the rails. I think we all can agree that we all want good things for St John and the USVI, and we all want to minimize the risk to those living there."
"Thanks to everyone for making this travel forum completely useless, and for turning it into just another 'i'm smarter than you' forum. seems to me that some of us want to eventually return as tourists to the island, while others are hopeful that we stay away as long as possible. I am most likely going to cancel our upcoming 2 week vacation to St John because of one reason; i'm not comfortable spending my money as a tourist on an island inhabited by people who clearly don't want me there.4.3 million people worldwide have tested positive for the virus. There are 7.8 billion people on the planet. My math says that you're arguing about a virus that has infected .05% of the world's population."
"williamsfamily; If you go back to the beginning, I was entirely civil and respectful until Susan got nasty. And those manners you were raised with don't stop you from accusing me (indirectly at that) of lying. I say again; I don't watch ANY network news, they all have their own agenda, and I loathe that kind of thing. I shouldn't feel obligated to say this, but historically I have been a conservative voter, as you seem to be implying something about my politics here. But I'm able to form my own opinions, and when something doesn't align with reality, I call it such."
"Deacs24, thanks for your measured response and I completely agree with the points you raise. My feelings remain the same - I would be very happy to see visitors start to arrive when there is sufficient testing available both stateside and here to keep our risk of contagion to the barest reasonable minimum as we simply cannot cope with anything other than that. That's been my concern from Day One. We're slowly moving forward to the point where we'll see better controls and maybe that'll happen in the coming weeks - we simply don't know."
"@Deacs - Great post and in a respectful manner. Reasonable questions that I wonder about too.I would also state that everyone should view COVID as likely to be endemic for the foreseeable future. It will not be snuffed out by the shutdown, regardless of how long that lasts. The R0 is just too high and nearly everyone invected is an asymptomatic carrier for a long time. Therefore, there will be unknown carriers traveling around the world and it won't ever be preventable unless there is total isolation. Even then, the moment any people are allowed to travel to a destination, it will become exposed again.So, the risk isn't going away this month, or the next 6 months, or years into the future in terms of exposure if the goal is no new outbreaks in a community. Endemic diseases are those that we learn to live with and accept the risk. Measures can be taken to slow down the spread to a steady state, but COVID will be with the world for an extended period of time.Based on that, what will be the decisions made by the USVI residents on how they want to proceed over the next few years? Obviously, that is entirely in their hands to decide and weigh the economic destruction vs. the health risk. It just needs to be viewed as a longer term decision based on the likelihood that they won't be able to stop COVID from arriving anytime flights and boats are allowed in, which they still are today. There is no magic time to wait where the risk will be gone."
"I don't really disagree with the thrust of that, but have a couple comments. I agree it isn't going away anytime soon, so you can't be 100% safe no matter what. What I think needs to happen, is the numbers have to come way down, which will take another month or three (depending on how people behave individually). But, we will see, one way or another. I just hope it is handled as intelligently as it may be."
"This simply isn't true. Georgia has NOT experienced an uptick since they started reopening. IN FACT - yesterday the IHME revised it's models regarding Georgia. They predicted that by June 12 there would be 1783 infections. Yesterday, they revised that down to 367. Georgia's infections are decreasing even with their reopening.I'm not trying to be nasty. We need to stop with the lies and fear-mongering. Facts matter. You can argue all day long about whether or not USVI *should* or *should not* reopen. But keep it to factual information. The curve has flattened...and is decreasing in most areas.The economic affects of this shut down will kill millions more people, especially in developing nations, than the actual virus will. May areas of the world are reliant on 1st world tourism dollars, and they don't have functioning governments with functioning welfare programs. People there will starve. We've pulled out the Peace Corps and Dr.s without Borders. They are not getting vaccines, diseases are now surging. So again, this is too important to spread misinformation - like this disease is surging when it is not. There are USVI ""purists"" who don't want tourists there no matter what. There are business people who want tourists there no matter what. Again, I just want to keep it factual and not based of fake hysterics."
"Deacs - Great points. Many workers here have not received their stimulus checks nor have they received their unemployment. And nobody who is smart wants to depend on those checks over the coming weeks. Also you have many workers that have been paid under the table and cannot get unemployment. Many businesses got PPP but it doesn’t replace tourist revenue. And you can only get forgiveness on 8 weeks of rent and payroll and that starts when the money is disbursed, typically in the last two weeks. So the clock is already running. I worry about St Johns seniors. We’ve been involved in doing grocery and hot meal delivery to them during the epidemic. We will continue to do so after June 1 to keep them from being exposed to tourists.Timmmmmmmmaaaaaaay. I’m tired of seeing my friends and neighbors that work or own businesses suffer. They need to go back to work. I think the governor has done a good job so far and trust him to open June 1st if that’s the decision. Jeflaflin- Here’s something you may or may not know. I would think not. Any local that runs around on Facebook begging people to not cancel their trips because we need their tourist dollars is going to be shamed on the St. John local Facebook pages by a very vocal very small minority. . So you aren’t going to see much of that, it’s not worth the hassle! Come down. Enjoy yourself. It will be a little different but so is everything else in the world right now.Edited: 1:54 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"""Many workers here have not received their stimulus checks nor have they received their unemployment."" That was all covered in detail in today's Governor's address which really should be watched as it addresses a lot of misinformation making the rounds."
Sttres- I do listen to his addresses and I understand why it’s been delayed and what they are doing about it. So what? The fact is most people here have not got their money and don’t want to depend on weekly checks from vidol considering people are still waiting on their tax returns from 2018!
"Geez, I missed a lot today! Susan, not nasty at all. Well made points by deacs, tourne, susan. Like I said earlier, I do believe the governor is doing a good job and will do careful assessments with each change he implements, so if a problem is discerned, he can stop it before it gets to a point that the islands cannot handle it. Cases are overall down, and have been coming down for weeks. This is not near as important as hospitalizations which are way down. Now that we know intubation and mechanical ventilation is more harmful than we thought at the beginning, those will naturally come down as we do all we can to avoid it. Mortality is quite low and that is a good thing. Unfortunately, any testing for disease is practically useless as it is only a snapshot of the second the specimen is collected. If I test negative before boarding the plane, I could be exposed to a viral load on the plane and be contagious and asymptomatic for the duration of my trip. If they test antibodies, that is good if you are positive, but a negative will mean nothing as it won't tell you if you are contagious. That is a conundrum that I don't think we can solve whether on the islands or mainland, hence my reasoning to say try opening it up in the measured way the governor is planning, assess the results and modify as needed. Nobody is advocating for the islands to open full tilt, which is impossible right now anyhow as some places have decided to not rent, flight numbers are down, airlines are not filling flights, it is low season, and many people are still hesitant to travel. We also know that there is a direct correlation between mortality and unemployment rate, so the economic impact must be included in the overall picture. Tunnel vision is a dangerous thing."
"The cheques have already started going out as of last week, another batch is going out tomorrow and they'll continued to be mailed out every week. Any ""delay"" (and I use the word very loosely) was explained in detail by the Governor today which you can hear if you watch the address. As of three days ago 20 million statesiders still hadn't received their stimulus cheques so obviously this is not something peculiar to the USVI. Residents of Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico have only just started receiving them too. Not everything is peculiar to the USVI, much as a few would have one believe."
"""Tunnel vision is a dangerous thing.""The irony drips. Enjoy your vacation."
"Not even sure where to start sttres. Stimulus is one piece and even by your numbers VI is way behind to stateside and you know all the shady stuff and back and forth to get the stimulus checks done here. Things are very peculiar about it! Considering the $600 add on for unemployment most people are owed, it’s a way bigger amount than the stimulus. What about those checks? Also very peculiar. I do consulting for St. John restaurant owners and many of the bartenders and servers are friends. All of them are hurting... but whatever things are fine and we are like everyone else. Said no one that lives here."
"Tournesol, this is really not the place for this discussion. However, if you watch today's Governor's address he addresses all of this at length (including the unemployment stimulus checks which you mention) and if you followed local news and had watched the Governor's previous addresses you would know full well the additional complications involving disbursement of the stimulus cheques. There was absolutely nothing ""shady"" about it at all nor is there anything peculiar. The online St Thomas Source is an excellent resource and then of course there's always the online VI Consortium and the Virgin Islands Daily News.If your bartender and restaurant owners and friends need assistance to sort out exactly what they have to do to receive help the resources are right there - which has also been addressed at length by the Governor in his addresses and in the media. I have steered several of my own friends and acquaintances in the right direction and they've had no problem at all.If you're dissatisfied with what goes on in your new home then best to get facts straight first - and one must always resist the temptation to get caught up in the coconut telegraph."
"Sttres- I honestly have other things to do today than to respond to all the inaccuracies in your post. And defending the way the VIBIR has handled the stimulus checks shows me that you lack critical thinking skills so I’d be wasting my time anyway. The VI unemployment system is empirically the most corrupt, bankrupt and inefficient system in the country. We are the only state/territory that owes money to the federal trust system for UI. Over $60mm. It takes a processer over an hour to process one claim. That’s why no one has gotten that money. Anyway I’m wasting my time. Enjoy St Thomas.PS I process unemployment insurance for businesses in over 40 states and the VI’s. I’ve helped all my VI employees file their claims. Months ago. Still no money.Edited: 5:33 pm, May 14, 2020 "

"TimmyIt’s seldom that I agree with you. But opening up the USVI right now to me is not correct. Once you see the body bags being wheeled at 2:00 am in the morning, out of a major hospital and the line of a couple dozen hearses receiving them you to might think twice about traveling.Ok if your not the 100,000 already dead - but you could be if not careful and be 100,001. Just Sayin"
"Thanks. I really don't understand how people can just deny real, verifiable facts. But here we are today, and facts mean nothing now. It's all tribal BS, and loud noises. Lather, rinse, repeat on social media. After the second, armed protest at our capitol building there are over 80 verified, confirmed cases of transmission just at that event. Now how many of those 80 will pass it on to multiple other people? The stupidity is palpable. I hate it so much.Edited: 9:10 am, May 16, 2020 "
"Just curious. What does 80 verified, confirmed cases of transmission at the Michigan capitol event mean? Do you have a link for that story?Edited: 1:35 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"There have been a couple armed protests both at, and inside the Michigan capitol building. Since the last one, they have traced approx 80 new cases back to those protest events. I'm sorry, but I can't find the article now, it was several days ago. I spent a few minutes looking, but don't feel like spending the time, honestly. Believe it, don't, whatever."
"Oh come on, TIMMMAAY has a link to every scary COVID story —-all directly applicable of course. And mixed with a crusade to tell people not to travel to STJ now, July, a year from now, who knows how long. Why does the governor even need a phased approach, when they can make decisions that affect the lives and livelihoods of tens of thousands based on these news links."
"I may be able to help clarify your question 54b - I've been holding out from responding to this thread but feel one of the latest posts really needs a response. I live in Michigan. Not in Detroit. Yes, there have been protests in Lansing (capitol) addressing our severe lock down measures. Yes, some of the protesters carried arms (permitted in our state). No, I did not attend - I am beyond busy working every day. I have never seen a reference to the claim that 80 new cases of COVID-19 have been tied to these protests. I keep up to date on COVID-19 matters as my professional life is very tied to the stages of opening (receive daily updates). Large new case report numbers are much more likely to be due to loading, typically on weekdays, (holding cases from nursing homes and correntional facilities and dumping them into the totals at once), or juking from AB tests (reporting positive ANTIBODY tests as new cases when clearly they are not - 20 states are doing this, trying to determine if MI is one). I notice the poster did not provide a link. Do I feel Caribbean travel should be happening in two weeks? No, and I am sure many others feel the same. Fear mongering, and shaming however, doesn't help anyone.Edited: 3:11 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"Timmaay, I was actually curious because I hadn't heard that story and I couldn't find that story on Google, which given how much news coverage those protests got, one would think if verifiable exposure occurred there, it would be a story most news outlets would trip over themselves to post.Regardless, the bigger point is you said that in the very same post in which you shook your finger at people for denying verifiable facts and then spouted one that you yourself couldn't verify (or at least can't right now.....). And then now you're telling me you don't ""feel like spending the time"" to find it in a thread in which you have spent lots of time on lots of posts not to mention one with six links in it. If anyone has time to go find a link, it's you, brother.Word to the wise from someone who's put his foot in his mouth plenty...don't talk the talk if you're gonna talk out of both sides of your arse because believe me, your credibility just went way down. And that sucks because I thought you'd made lots of good points earlier in this thread and then the final insult of dismissing my inquiry with the universally lame, ""you don't care if I believe it or not."" You obviously do.Bottom line, nobody actually knows what the right answer is right now. It's impossible to know. It's no different than what's going on here in Dallas...we have a local judge telling us one thing and our state's Governor telling us another when there's never been a time when they should be working together more. It's absurd and a total indictment of how the polarization of politics is making everyone losers in this country....no different than this thread is making me miserable on this forum.(Queue tiny violin)."
"Thanks, Skicubamom...same page and I actually thought Timmaayy made a good point earlier with regard to how urban areas and rural areas may be on different timelines with regard to exposure to the virus. And while the more densely populated areas are on the downward swing (and let's hope that stays that way), which sways the overall numbers, it doesn't mean places like STJ that may have not been as exposed would not be hurt by opening up sooner than later. Is that alone a reason not to open up on June 1...I don't have that answer. I thought Deacs also had a good comment about how prolonged economic hardship could potentially directly or indirectly cause even more health issues and death in the longer run.Really tough call."
"54b; I'll spend some more time, probably tomorrow, maybe Monday to try to find it. I don't make things up. It is Saturday, and a fairly nice day after a week of rain. I'm working in the garden, laying on the deck, and eating. Came in to make coffee. No, I don't feel like spending the time right now. But I will, later. I will say it's funny that that is the one people want to zero in on, but again, whatever. Didn't say I don't care, I said ""whatever"". I choose my words pretty carefully, as I didn't want to say ""I don't care"", because I do, just not enough to disrupt my Saturday over an internet argument that's clearly going nowhere.Edited: 3:52 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"Timmmay, not zeroing in, I'm just late to the party...I finally had a chance after a long work week to do what I enjoy doing in my spare time, which is reading this forum and dreaming/planning another trip to STJ. It's pouring here in Dallas, so it's good day for this. But certainly not going to begrudge your shot to enjoy yours. Enjoy your Saturday. Let me know what you find when you have a chance.Edited: 4:03 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"In Wisconsin the number of Corona virus cases went up for one day only but you can not keep lock down forever. Everybody can return to work and normal life in a responsible way. Only the most vulnerable , elderly with underlying serious health conditions should shield.The increase in number of cases is not as important as the number of death b/c for most people the infection is like flue or even milder."
"Eacape, I thought your state supreme court just overturned the stay at home orders for this whole state of Wisconsin, no?"
I did not say that somebody else did but it's true
He is changing the wording of the stay at home order to get around the Supreme Court order
"It would be great if we could rely on people to be sensible and do the right thing. The push to open has been touted as ""trust us to be mature, responsible individuals"". Unfortunately , given the oppurtunity, too many prove themselves to be selfish clueless dunce caps.Case in point, my DH, DS and I hit lehigh gorge state park yesterday for some kayaking and biking. We were the only ones wearing masks! The signs on the bike trail said stay single file, in actuality people rode side by side and literally would ride right at you leaving maybe 2 ft of distancing total joke.So much for common sense and social responsibility.Edited: 8:44 am, May 17, 2020 "
"There are strong feelings on both sides - everywhere! - about the timing and limits to re-opening the economy and Vacation Travel has often brought some strong negative remarks as non-essential and elitist from many people who have lost family, jobs and suffered for months."
"So. I'm back to take a couple lumps, and post some more info that half of you won't take seriously. 54b: I'm giving up the ghost, I can't locate the article I referred to. Though I try mightily to avoid talking out either side of my arse, I can't find it, and am giving up. But that is only one point out of many that were made. I've found a few articles that touch on it, but can't find the (approx) 80 cases linked to the protests. Again, that's a small thing that doesn't have any real bearing on the points I've been trying to get across. You can say I lost credibility, that's fine, not my goal here. A few articles about states opening, and debunking the comments earlier about Georgia and FL cases going down (they aren't, the governors lied and manipulated data, I'm shocked). Commence eye rolling. Though I can't find the article about the Michigan protests spreading the virus, here is one about the same thing in Wisconsin. I suppose it's possible this is what I was thinking of ; https://www.tmj4.com/news/coronavirus/72-got…Article about the protests, and the SEEMING spread from those events (I normally wouldn't link to the Guardian, but I'm feeling lazy today): https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may…This one is about how though the early hot spots are getting under control, it is now spreading in smaller, less populous counties. This is a nationwide trend;  https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archive…How no state meets criteria given to re-open; https://www.businessinsider.com/no-states-me…Antibody testing in CA shows many more people have been infected than we thought. A LOT MORE.

"TIMMMAAY - Not sure what you think the ultimate goal is with the shutdown, but the stated objective was to blunt the initial surge so that healthcare systems weren't overwhelmed. That has come and gone, albeit with some areas pushed to the brink for a while.It will likely be a steady roll of cases from here on with a few pockets of hotspots here and there. The virus is endemic and can't realistically be eradicated, so we may as well come up with a livable balance while it takes its course. Here's a great article from the respect journal Nature from last week. Head down to the last few paragraphs for some conclusions.https:/…d41586-020-01315-7The USVI will have to decide for themselves the level of risk/reward they are willing to take over the coming years. But, the risk will never be zero and mass unemployment/poverty has its own set of consequences in terms of a breakdown of society."
"Parkie; I fully understand the purpose of the ""stay at home/lock-down"" or whatever we're calling it. That is not what this conversation was about, as we were discussing the immediate risks to the islands, should they stick with the June 1 opening date. Please don't shift the goal posts. This is what I mean when I keep using the words ""intellectual honesty"". What you did above is, in my opinion, a cheap tactic to just ignore everything that I spent time putting together this morning. The fact is, the USVI's, and most Caribbean islands are not equipped to handle a serious outbreak. They shut down just in time to avoid over loading their health systems. I'm providing clear, unambiguous evidence that cases are still spiking in many areas of the mainland US. This is not opinion, it's not a disingenuous argument. It's reality. Also, several of the links that I posted above were intended to directly refute comments made by Susan, saying that I'm spreading ""disinformation"". It would be nice if that were acknowledged, but I'm not holding my breath.Then there is another poster here, talking about how they only wear a mask in public if the store owner requires it. That one was especially grating to me. It's selfish, short sighted, and ignores the reality of how this thing is spread. It's just slightly maddening.Edited: 12:46 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"What do you think the impact would be for a second shut down on the islands? I think it would be far, far worse than just holding course for a few more weeks to allow the more rural areas to get the spread under control."
"Timmmayyy...I don't think Parkie is trying to shift the goal posts and at least to me, the goal post should be the name of this thread, which pertains to July. I think any reasonable, open minded person understands and agrees with your stance that not all areas are experiencing the pandemic on the same exposure cycle. So if the USVI is indeed well behind other densely populated areas that have already peaked and then a bunch of those people come knocking on the door on June 1, then yeah, we got Columbus arrives and gives all the locals measles part duex and nobody wants that for sure.So if that's your point, definitely point made, at least with me and I appreciate your efforts, admissions in the early post and intent.But now let's talk productively and purposefully without emotion because I have a booking in late July and while I don't consider myself nor plan on being the selfish jerk that shows up just because the Governor says I can, I also haven't canceled my plans yet because neither has the airline I booked flights on nor the villa owner I booked from who has 50% of my deposit and is going to be asking for the other 50% come June 1 if the Governor says, OPEN, neither of which are refundable (oh the villa owner has confirmed as much). And I'm not obtuse to the fact that we're talking about a vacation in the middle of a major health crisis. But I'm not having this conversation on in the pubic square or down at Mercy General, I'm having it in one of the few places that I can get perspective on my particular situation. And I'm definitely interested in getting all perspectives and trying to make a really smart choice not just for me but all involved. So I'm asking you...in your opinion, if June 1 is bad, is June 15 any better? Or how about July 1? Is there a metric we're looking for stateside, some barometer, that would give you a better inclination that it's time to open the USVI if you were the Governor?Because that's the kind of info I need when negotiating with a villa owner more so than some guy on TA said I was an evil person for even thinking about coming to the USVI."
"I think that's their call in the USVI, as I stated. Their business to decide. If they want to open up or stay shut down, so be it. I simply think the same vulnerability will be there next month, 6 months from now, and 18 months from now. Asymptomatic carriers will still be all over the world and traveling around spreading it here and there. Some will make it into the USVI.Try not to let yourself get too worked up over all this. No one has all the right answers and these are just discussions of opinions. Contagious diseases suck and everyone is trying to feel out the right course through this one."
"Something else that struck me recently regarding this: In Ohio they’ve now confirmed that the virus was here since at least January. Common sense would say that it was in NYC and other big city areas even sooner than that. During winter. Meaning peak travel season to the USVI and other parts of the Caribbean, from those areas. Hard to believe it wouldn’t have made it down the the USVI during that time frame, before the travel ban was put in place."
"Commence eye-rolls again, y'all. 54b; the conversation has clearly been centered around the opening date, and what that opening will consist of, regardless of the thread title, or OP's intentions (apologies to OP for the severe derailment). That said, it is very difficult to have a productive conversation when one half of the participants won't so much as acknowledge what I have taken the time to post, in direct response to their prior statements. At least I'm attempting to back up what I'm saying, which is more than I can say for most here. Late July is very different from June 1. I keep saying I think we're several weeks ahead of where we should be regarding opening, when looking at what's happening. If I had something booked late July, I would probably be doing the same, with some hardcore wishing as well. And I completely understand everyone's desire to get away, with all the craziness. But I think there is a large amount of entitlement at work there, and as was said to me earlier, tunnel vision. With that, I'm out of here for a while. Obviously I'm not going to change anyone's mind, but if there was someone on the fence about it, and any of this made them think twice then it was worth it. We have decided to wait until December, at soonest. That very much depends on what happens between now and then. Enjoy your vacations folks."
Fair enough...thanks for your time.
"Booked in November for 8/26-9/2. American has changed our flight to a shorter layover but our flight is still good to go... on a Wednesday. Same with the airbnb. I have an autoimmune disease but not hugely symptomatic. We are planning on going still unless the government tells us otherwise. My friend and I didn't come to this decision lightly since I also have a cruise planned in November and Isla Mujeres in January but as long as we feel as though we can safely travel, we will.I will never again scoff at someone on a plane in a mask. That will be me moving forward, even when back to 'normal.'"
"From what I read, the island is open. We may need masks which is fine. We are arriving August 2nd for our 14th visit to St. John. The beaches are not at all crowded in the summer. There have been times that there are under 10 on the beach. Enjoy"
"The current USVI situation for visitors is as follows:Visitors whose residence is Arizona, Texas or Florida will be required, effective Monday July 13th, to have either a negative PCR 72 hour test OR a positive antibody test (which lasts for 6 months). If you do not have either of those tests available upon arrival you will be required to quarantine for 14 days. This mandate will be in effect from Monday July 13th for two weeks. Depending on stateside spikes, more states may be added at that time."
