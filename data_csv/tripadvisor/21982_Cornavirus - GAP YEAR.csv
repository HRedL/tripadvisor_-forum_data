"At this point, no one can tell when social distancing measures will end. Changes are so fluid that no one can tell when travel restrictions will kick in or get lifted so it is futile to try to plan for a trip. As long as you have your life/health, fun can be had when all this is over. It is a worldwide crisis. Travelling at this time risks bringing the virus to vulnerable people in other destinations as well as the people you interact with in your home country."
God bless you.... and I hope you don't come anywhere near me at least while COVID-19 lasts!
""" our experiences are being taken away from us""No just delayed until safer times, surely your health comes before enjoyment."
It’s actually called coronavirus!
">>I see that there is a large group of individuals in this boat with me, our exeriances are being taken away from us!<<Loss of experience? Think yourself lucky that you aren't one of those who have had their entire life taken away from them, or those that they have left behind who can only grieve for them.Your screenname suggests you think you are invulnerable to the virus. Unfortunately that makes your planned behaviour a plan to be the vector to those who are.If you are for real, rather than a troll as the posting pattern indicates as a strong possibility - wait until its over if the experience is that vital to your life."
Do I need glasses or did Op not mention Singapore at all?
"No, Bill, your eyesight is fine.Reads like a troll - and one who can't spell.The virus is hurting everybody, we were incredibly lucky, we flew into Singapore before we'd even heard of Wuhan. And left just as the UK government warned against unnecessary travel."
"Despite officials trying to close it, those wild & crazy youngsters are still enjoying Spring Break at Miami Beach.A golden ""oppertunity"" for you ...https://www.miaminewtimes.com/slideshow/phot…"
Sounds like a troll. People are stuck at home with nothing to do. Why not stir things up on a travel forum?
"Volunteering in a Care Home for the elderly would be an emotionally enriching, morally rewarding and socially useful way to spend your Summer , Mike.But before you do so, it would be wise to apply a Steroidal cream to that virus in your Corn, as athlete's foot or similar fungal infections are not only highly communicable , but look unpleasant and, if ignored, very smelly"
"Can’t believe there are still socially irresponsible people as such around, taking this whole thing as a joke when thousands are dying.Edited: 4:21 pm, March 20, 2020 "

"Singapore is still one of the safer place to travel even at this difficult times. Upon arrival, just need to stay home for 14 days to make sure you do not have the virus and wala, you are free to roam around in Singapore. Well, that is provided if you have intention to stay in Singapore for a month, else, no point traveling to any parts of the world now..."
