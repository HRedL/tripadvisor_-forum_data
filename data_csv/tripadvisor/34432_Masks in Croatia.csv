I’m thinking about booking for Croatia for early September but wondered what the situation is with wearing masks over there - both my husband and I are exempt but don’t know what exemptions apply there - does anybody know?
"HiWe were in Croatia recently from mid June to mid July, & are going back this weekend. You do not need to wear a mask anywhere other than in shops, supermarkets & on public transport. If you are visiting any public buildings where social distancing is difficult, or in a lift in a hotel, it may be advisable to wear a mask."
Can i ask what you mean by you are exempt?
"In the Czech Republic, you have exemptions for certain conditions- both health conditions and mental issues such as autism. You don’t need a written proof. I am also curious to hear if you need a written proof in Croatia."
I don’t need to wear one
@6 Just curious why you don't need to wear one.Care to share?
It’s a medical exemption
"I would think if you cant wear a mask for medical reasons and are travelling from a badly infected area, such as the UK, i would think you should maybe reconsider whether the holiday is a good idea."
"Autism is understandable, but I really can't wrap my head around what kind of 'medical restriction' would prevent one from wearing a mask. It has been proven again and again that a mask has no effect on oxygen saturation in blood, and if someone does have a preexisting respiratory condition, galavanting around in a pandemic without any protection is about the worst possible thing to do. If you want to place yourself at risk, no one cares...but if you want to place everyone around you at risk, stay home. Most people are being infected by asymptomatic carriers who are themselves unaware that they are positive."
"Rikared, maybe you would like to inform yourself of the current rates of covid 19 infection. Over the last 14 days, the UK's rate is slightly below Croatia's.https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"dovninit It has been proven again and again that a mask has no effect on preventing spread of virus. Contrary, it worsens health of mask bearer itself. Problem is breathing in and out all that stay on masks surface.All this compulsory mask wearing is just how politics deal with problem. Maybe you can use technical respirator and special closed glasses if you are so afraid of Pandemic.Edited: 9:13 am, August 07, 2020 "
"WLM: the science speaks for itself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbAzUUtqbiUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbAzUUtqbiUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch…The bottom line is that COVID is spread when people exhale/cough/speak/etc. Anything which slows down the velocity and limits the range of what is coming out of the infected person will reduce the spread. It is not rocket science, but rather common sense. No one is saying that a mask will filter 100% of the virus, it is all about containment. Since no one can be sure whether or not they are an asymptomatic carrier/spreader of the virus at any given time, it is better for us all to assume we are all infected and act accordingly."
"downinitWhich science:?) I read so many results of so called scientific researchs about corona, which contradict to one another, that I'm suspicious about it.In result I trust only my own simple logic dealing with all contradictory information and so far I can't say that corona virus with so small death percentage of infected is something absolutely dangerous compared to other diseases and people must be treated by governments like puppets - don't do this, don't go there.And as I said, let those who are afraid, use their own means to deal with problem like technical respirators.And so called asymptomatic or simply saying - healthy people, whose organisms overcome virus, don't need to be treated as sick.Edited: 11:08 am, August 07, 2020 "
"I'm fully aware of the rates but what you need to remember is that Croatia are having a ""spike"" - the UK are claiming to be all over it. And Croatia initial spike was down to boardering countries travelling in when restrictions lifted, the UK's numbers are just their own issues. Lets see where things are in 2 weeks but back to my original point, why are most questions and complaints about restrictions on travel from UK and US citizens. I read a post and without checking country of poster you can tell they are from one of these areas. It is this mentality that has their numbers so bad. Fair enough if you want to ruin your own country with mindless behaviour, dont be bringing that attitude to other countries."
"I would just love to know why one is ""exempt""? below is a list from your own government page. The requirement to wear a face covering does not apply to:a child under the age of 11passengers in an allocated cabin, berth or other similar accommodation, when they are alone or with members of their household or support bubblepassengers who remain in their private vehicle while on board public transport, for example on a car ferrya person who enters or is within a transport hub in a vehicle (other than a vehicle being used for the provision of a public transport service)an employee of the transport hub or the relevant public transport operator, when they are acting in the course of their employmentany other person providing services to the transport hub or public transport operator, under arrangements made with the transport hub or transport operator, who is providing those servicesa constable or police community support officer acting in the course of their dutyan emergency responder such as a paramedic or fire officer acting in the course of their dutyan official, for example a border force officer, acting in the course of their duties"
"Science debates as they are, and I can't believe they exist, if you visit someone's country, and they ask you wear a mask......you wear a mask. Period."
"Yeah or you don’t go, in the first place. All this science about masks preventing spread is not taking into consideration that people don’t know how to use it properly. And by not using it properly, it increases the risk of spread because people touch the mask after touching other objects, they put it under their nose or chin, and they reuse the same mask over and over again."
Bureaucrats of Latvia just now write Croatia out from red list and put in yellow list. It means that corona panicked can breath more freely.:)
"For what it's worth, I have an ocular condition known as convergence insufficiency. In my case, when objects are close to my eyes I get double vision. I had surgery for it when I was a kid but the surgery didn't really do much. Previously I had to blink to get rid of the double vision but after the surgery I was able to refocus my eyes without blinking. This condition doesn't prevent me from wearing a mask, but if I put the mask over my nose I do get double vision. It sucks. Some masks that are thinner and sit closer to my nose aren't as bad, but overall it's a real pain in the ass. And can you imagine explaining this to people who are mad that the mask isn't over your nose? ""I have a medical condition."" ""SURE YOU DO!"""
"Except for brief visits of supermarkets and boarding moment on ferries and airplanes, I always used mask, when it was mandatory, under my nose. Even in planes and buses. Party because vomiting feeling, partly to honour my freedom. I wanted to see people, who dare to say me something.;-) But they respected my freedom.Therefore - avoid mask on nose and you can always tell to some mask fanatic that you have your health problems when using masks.Edited: 9:17 am, today "
