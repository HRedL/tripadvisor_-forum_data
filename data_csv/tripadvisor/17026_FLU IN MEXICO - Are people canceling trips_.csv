I'm going to Acapulco on business Monday morning.  Are people canceling their trips because of the flu 'epidemic'? 
I have a business meeting in New York in a week and I am thinking of canceling that (if the 27 cases in New York prove to be swine flu). No cases in Acapulco yet though.
"I'm in great debate, we are scheduled to go in 1 week. If there is a travel advisory warning issued by Canada obviously we will cancel. If not, we will probably go. I live in Toronto and witnessed the SARS outbreak first hand, the media certainly portrayed it in a different light. (it was serious but it was incredible how the US stations showed life in Toronto at the time, totally not accurate) I'm not saying that things aren't serious in Mexico but it's just so difficult to know when one paper says how severe the situation is and another says the opposite. Ugh!"
need advice planning a trip to cancun mex may 8-13 should i cancel due to the swine flue thing? 
We are scheduled to arrive in Acapulco on the9th May from Ireland..I've just spoken to British Airways and they have no plans to cancel flights...I'm more concerned that the usual clubs pubs and restaurants will be closed or empty ..can anyone confirm the impact on the resort ?
Since there are currently no cases in Acapulco things are as normal. Can't predict the future though....
"Anyone who will still travel to Mexico is braver than I am. I live an hour from the border, and I won't even go to Douglas, AZ!!!!"
your nuts
"We don't leave till May 19th, so I am hoping it will be under control by then. We are headed to Isla Mujeres by way of Cancun.I am not overly worried about my husband and I as we will take the normal pre-cautions of washing our hands,e tc. My concern is that we are travelling with out 3 year old who puts his hands on everything. We love Isla, and have been counting done the days till we leave...."
Just remember you will be flying with a lot of people in small area. that worries me more than being in Mexico
I'm with you on that one - the plane ride terrifies me as the air is all recycled. I can definitely wear a mask but I wonder how much that helps?
"I was supposed to leave for PV today and canceled. Just doesn't seem like a good idea. While I think the likelihood is very low of contacting any illness, I would rather just go at a later date and enjoy myself rather than being overly paranoid that the woman who sneezed in front of me may have Swine flu. I'm very bummed about the last minute cancellation. I'm still trying to get my hotel penalty fee waived, but I booked it online so they're pretty resistant. Oh well. "
"I agree, it's not Mexico that worries me, it's the plane ride getting there! Also, I'm a bit concerned because they very well may not allow you back into the US if you try to get on the airplane with a fever or other signs of flu. You can have a fever without having swine flu. But even so, your left in Mexico trying to get the best health care you can. We have a trip to Sayulita (north of Puerto Vallarta) planned for May 21st. I've only got two more day to cancel without penalty. I'm going to hold out until the last second to get as much information as possible. But, if I had to make a decision now, I think I'd probably cancel and rebook for July or August. If I had children going with me (who simply can't exercise great hygene) I would not even consider going. Last time I was on an airplane with my 3 year old, he started sucking the arm rest before I could get to him -- yuck!!! "
"I'm scheduled to go to Puerto Vallarta on May 10th. Right now United will not allowed flights pass May 6th to reschedule without penalties. It will be inconvient for me to try to reschedule this past the end of May because of work demands. I too, am more afraid of the recirculated air on the flight more than being in Mexico. I don't necessarily want to take a trip to risk getting sick and being off work for swine flu, but yet, I don't want to throw away the $800.00 I have invested in this vacation. "
"We are going with the ""wait and see option"". We don't leave till the 19th - I am thinking it will be either somewhat under control by then or a full blown problem.We are fortunate that the condo we stay at will credit us for another trip w/o penalty. We will have to pay re-booking fees due to FF miles, but I can live with that."
"Since I avoid most people, drink lots of tequila and eat lots of hot sauce, I doubt the swine has a chance of living in me! I am going to Grand Xcaret in the end of May, swine or no swine.. Just wash your hands, avoid sick people and drink lots of tequila and you will do fine."
"Well it's official, we have cancelled. Our carrier has offered to rebook us with no charge to any other location so why wouldn't we. Too bad though, I had really wanted to go to Mexico and the resort we were at looked fabulous. Jamaica, here we come! "
