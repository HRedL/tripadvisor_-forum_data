"hello, sorry I know we're all fed up with Coronavirus posts, but I am confused by the UK government advice which states:Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people immediately if you’ve travelled to the UK from:other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand in the last 14 days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild)Why is Thailand included if, according to the figures I've seen, it has fewer cases than the UK does?Or are there really a high number of cases?Just wondering really, thanks for any info."
"I think it was considered high risk because of the amount of Chinese tourists that go there.Edited: 5:01 am, March 05, 2020 "
"That advise was issued quite some time ago before it had spread to Europe, so you can't really compare the figures now to then. Also some other countries have been added to the list such as Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia. This virus started in China so I can why they thought it was high risk."
"Where are getting this news from? I just watched Sky News, there was no mention of Thailand."
"It an old advice but still current, you can find it on the Government's FCO site and various other places.Edited: 6:05 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Here is a link: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…But this has been widely published, I'm surprised if you are British you don't know about."
"If you read carefully its self isolate IF you have travelled and SUBSEQUENTLY have a cough, high temp or shortness of breath. Its not self isolate just because you have travelled there.Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people immediately if you’ve travelled to the UK from:Hubei province in China in the last 14 days, even if you do not have symptomsIran, lockdown areas in northern Italy or special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, even if you do not have symptomsother parts of mainland China or South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand in the last 14 days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild)other parts of northern Italy (anywhere north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar or Vietnam since 19 February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild)"
"Thailand listed, probably due to the Chinese tourist numbers, usually.Along with suspecting the numbers for cases in Thailand is probably much lower than reported, as testing isn't done as widespread. Low income Thais are not going to get tested, if they even go to a hospital if sick. Spend possibly a months salary, to find out what infection you have, that you'll recover from, simply stay at home.Edited: 6:31 am, March 05, 2020 "
"The UK advice is still in place though some other countries who officially have no cases have been added. The UK did a research project on where they thought was high risk based on traveller numbers from Wuhan / China. Some countries have tested a much lower number of people than others and obviously if you don't test people they don't count in the numbers. These are some testing numbers - doesn't include Thailand, latest figure seen for Thailand is 3895. https:/…"
That's testing figures for Thailand not cases. It's about 1/4 of number tested in UK.
"More disturbing now is all the workers coming back from South Korea, one report says they can trace 1,100 of them which presumably were meant to self isolating."

"More tests are more likely to find more cases?In the US they had only done less than 500 last 2nd March, if they run 10,000 tests then they will probably a load more positive. The reason why the UK cases shot up is because they have done a lot more testing recently."
"Simple answer is Thailand chief of health this week stated no information has or will be given to the public by order of bangkok and no daily updates of covid will be given. this was reported in the thaiger and the Phuket news. There doors are still open to china and they are unlikely to update fast as this affects tourism but if italy is in full lockdown now you can guarantee the infection in Thailand is worse then reported. Hence the uk advise and true reported information from Thailand is being limited so as to not affect there travel econemy more then already has been money talks in thailand.Edited: 10:19 pm, March 08, 2020 "

You can get updates here:https:/…situation.phpTesting numbers are low and also lots of test results are listed as 'pending' - 4234 tested and 1775 results are 'pending'. Lots seem to have been pending for a while. UK population is similar and tested 5 times as many and all results are given.
"As everyone said, the reason is that there are usually lots of Chinese tourists in Thailand and Thailand didn't introduce any travel ban, so it's extremely likely according to UK experts that there are cases in Thailand. The suspicion is that most cases go undetected/unreported, so the low official number does not reflect reality.All this is only theory, so may be true or not, but that's why the UK travel advice seems confusing"
"Its true no one knows whether the Thailand number is understated or not, however the #deaths is probably correct, so if only 1 death then probably not thousands of cases."
"In the UK government advice is not to wear masks unless you've tested positive / in hospital. It's partly as they've been found ineffective and partly as they don't want hospitals to run out. Some people here seem to have the need to buy 2,000 hand gels, 2,000 soaps, 2,000 toilet rolls and similar quantities of food for various imminent disasters of which COVID-19 is current one though they are using up their Brexit piles at the moment as the mass shortages didn't happen. Now you go to shops and there's no soap, handgel or toilet roll in lots of them."
"Hep A outbreak to follow.....On topic.....sort of, for UKHope people don't wait for a test result to wear a mask if they feel sick.Edited: 9:18 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Hi,With reference to post 20. The Chinese Government stopped groups of their own coming to Thailand and at the same time the majority of flights between both countries were cancelled."

"If you have a temperature it does not mean you have Coronavirus, also if you don’t have a temperature it does not mean you don’t have Coronavirus."
The UKs advise is not half as confusing as Thailand’s advise which seems to change almost everyday.
