Has anyone rescheduled their cancelled trip yet? Are insurance policies even willing to cover this now if a resurgence occurs again later this year?
"most of the policies have a 10 day (or longer) look over plan with a right to rescind.make sure that you read all of it and understand the cancellation policies.some of the more expensive plans have ""cancel for any reason"""
I would also be worried about getting travel medical insurance.
"Be sure to read all the fine print. Most policies exclude events that are known at the time of booking. For example if you book a trip AFTER a hurricane/storm has been named, you’re accepting that risk, and won’t be covered for loss against that. Clearly COVID-19 is “known” at this point, and any insurance company would jump at the chance to deny a claim based on that fact.EDIT: this from one of the big travel insurance companies might be of interest:https:/…covid19notificationCOVID-19 NotificationFOR POLICIES PURCHASED ON OR AFTER MARCH 11On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. Therefore, any losses for trip cancellation, trip interruption and/or trip delay caused by or resulting from quarantine due to COVID-19 is not considered “Unforeseen” and will not be covered under the terms and conditions of this insurance policy.Edited: 10:41 am, April 21, 2020 "
Good info from all above.
"We just cancelled our upcoming trip yesterday.As an owner at the ABC, I will lose my week without compensation.Insurance companies clearly state in the fine print that natural disasters( Hurricanes, Earthquakes, etc, and pandemics (which is what Covid 19 is classified as), are not covered.We Fly Jet blue and they have credited my miles and banked the cash I paid usable for up to 2 years. I am thankful for that.Aruba has been a very reliable travel spot but no one saw this coming. i am keeping myself informed about this virus as we go to summer and watch for a possible relapse this fall before I rebook"
Thanks everyone- not ready to rebook yet- looking to see a real positive change before we do- just nervous it might come back in the fall and then a rescheduled trip will need to be cancelled- I was lucky enough to not have a loss from this first one- nervous to lose money the second time around given it will be tough to get this covered.
