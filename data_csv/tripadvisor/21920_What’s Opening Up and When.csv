Georgia and Alabama are open.:) B.
"Georgia and Alabama aren't Illinois. Booya, this is the Illinois forum.Edited: 12:58 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"Yeah, shallow, I was like, what? What do Georgia and Alabama have to do with the Botanic Garden?"
"It was a joke, people. I got a laugh out of it.CV"
Thanks CV. Yes it was a joke.FYI. ;) - This is a smiley face.B.
That's exactly what I asked CV. What do Alabama and Georgia have to do with Illinois? Booya posted it : smiley face or no smiley face.
SS - Why so serious? B.
So Illinois should jump off a bridge because Georgia did?
"https://www.fox32chicago.comLooks like NOT a lot of social distancing going on here, and with all the other riots in other cities.Did you watch the space launch today. Wow a massive crowd were huddled together at Cocoa Beach.Well back to Chicago. Wonder if there will be new cases after these riots."
"On the plus side the Chicago Botanical Garden is one of my favorites of all the gardens I have seen. I look forward to visiting in the future (but perhaps not the near future). I am anxiously awaiting Chicago’s return to normal. Stay safe, Chicago."
"Thanks for this, when will the bars and stuff open up?"

"@jb,The mayor is threatening to pull back on the June 3 date of restaurants reopening for outdoor dining b/c of the rioting and looting. And frankly, it would be very difficult to patronize a restaurant right now because we have a curfew from 9pm to 6 am ""until further notice"". All CTA service is suspended at night and no train or bus service all day or night into the city core. There are National Guard checkpoints preventing vehicles getting off expressways into downtown; parts of Lake Shore Drive are shut down. So even if patrons decide to venture out, restaurant staff are likely to have a hard time getting to and from work safely. Not to mention deliveries. Some restaurants that were open for pick-up and delivery have announced they are closed this week.Bars are not included in the restaurant outdoor reopening because, according to the mayor, when people get intoxicated, they are less likely to observe social distancing. So I have not seen any date even mentioned for bars to reopen. But restaurants can now legally serve cocktails ""to go"" in addition to on premises.Chicago public health officials have expressed concern that the rioters/looters and legitimate protesters have not been wearing masks or observing social distancing, which could soon cause a big spike in COVID-19 cases. If that happens, all bets are off."
A lot of restaurants have paused to go orders this week. Lots of restaurants are damaged.We will see...B.
"We’re in worse shape now than during Covid-19 “stay-at-home”. The rioters (not the peaceful protesters) have caused more mayhem than the virus. All stores in River North that sold liquor, have been looted. The pharmacies and grocery stores are boarded up and closed. The Magnificent Mile is completely boarded up and shut down. Even our high rise condo is boarded up and we use the employee entrance. What was going to open up will not open up now. Downtown Chicago is locked down. Not only can’t people get into downtown, people in downtown can’t get out. (We tried yesterday) Check back for answers to your question of “when” at the end of June."
"According to the ""Chicago Tribune"" just now, Chicago is going ahead with Phase 3 reopening on June 3rd. Of course, some places that could open will choose not to due to the unrest."
"""Chicago will move ahead with looser coronavirus restrictions as planned on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced. Lightfoot previously said restaurants, hotels and many more businesses would get to start opening June 3 with reduced capacities and tight rules in place designed to stop COVID-19 cases from spiking. That timeline seemed imperiled in recent days as fallout from the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd led to nationwide protests and civil unrest, but Lightfoot said the city will move forward with its plan as scheduled.""https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking…"
"""Nearly three months after Navy Pier closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the iconic Chicago attraction has announced plans to begin its phased reopening plan on June 10.The first phase of reopening on Wednesday includes public access to outdoor spaces, restaurant patios and select attractions, the Pier said.“Following Navy Pier’s longest closure in recent history, we, along with the rest of Chicago, are anxious to reopen our spaces and safely welcome guests back to the Pier over the next few months as we work collectively to restore our local economy,” said Marilynn Gardner, Navy Pier president and CEO. “We recognize that our new reality is now accompanied by new standards, and as the People’s Pier, we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure the health, safety and comfort of all who visit the Pier.""The following will be open and available to the public:Navy Pier parking garages (free access)Polk Bros ParkPeoples Energy Welcome PavilionNorth and South Dock, Pier Park (rides remain closed)East End PlazaOutdoor restaurant spacesTour boatsSelect free programsNavy Pier will operate from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., though hours may vary per restaurant. All interior spaces, including the Chicago Children’s Museum and Chicago Shakespeare Theater, will remain closed during the first reopening phase. Rides will also stay closed until further notice, and fireworks displays and large-scale events remain canceled during Phase 1.""https:/…"
Free parking? Wow. They must be desperate.
Thanks for the updates!
I might go down just to park for free.....
"Libraries, lakefront parks west of Lake Shore Drive reopen = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
The FLW Home & Studio in Oak Park and Robie House in the City (Hyde Park) have reopened for tours. https://flwright.org/
"I have my reservation for the Chicago Botanic Gardens perimeter walk this Sunday. So excited! A friend made reservations for the same time slot, so that we can do a physically-distanced walk together."
"Lollapalooza is CancelledThe city also announced it is canceling all of its events through Labor Day, including Taste of Chicago, the Air and Water Show and the Chicago Jazz Festival to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment…Edited: 12:46 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"Green City Market announced that its first day open in Lincoln Park will be Saturday, June 13th (with social distancing, so that should be interesting). If the rules are the same as at the Evanston Farmers' Market, patrons won't be allowed to handle the produce."
"I've been going later to the Evanston Market, (so I missed strawberries last week) but it seems well-organized to me. I was under the impression that the vendors would only take credit or debit cards but apparently that is just a the preference of the Evanston, not a mandate. I did notice this last week that a couple of the vendors were in different spots."
"The West Ridge Nature Center at 5800 N. Western has reopened yay! I got in there yesterday before everyone knew about it thanks to a neighbor who is a volunteer there. Masks are required, though I was the only one actually wearing mine last evening."
Has anyone heard anything regarding the Art Institute of Chicago or Willis Tower? Have an anniversary this summer and I'm hoping to hit at least some of the staples.
Those are part of Phase 4. Nobody knows when that’s going to occur.
Navy Pier has a partial opening today (June 10). No entry into buildings but the sidewalks are open and outdoor dining under social spacing will happen. Some tour boats are expected to open. Rides will not reopen until phase 4.
Curtis Duffy's new restaurant Ever is taking reservations for inside dining starting July 28th. I didn't know that was going to be happening so soon but he is taking fully prepaid reservations.B.
Curtis is just optimistic lol
"The Chicago Riverwalk has closed to the public for 11 long weeks, but access will soon be restored. The city has confirmed that the Riverwalk will be partially reopened Friday, with some restrictions.The city is holding off on making an official announcement until Friday, but officials confirmed that access will be restored at 5 a.m.According to the city agency in charge of the Riverwalk, the path will be open in full from Lake Street to the Lakefront, from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. only, so residents can use it for exercise. After that, access will remain open between Lake and LaSalle Streets.https:/…"
Fantastic!
Global Entry interviews also just opened at O'hare. Plenty of availability as well.
Architecture tour boats return to the Chicago River today after being sidelined by the virus.https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/blair…
"Yeah both Wendella and Architectural boats are up -- with reduced numbers. The Riverwalk is also open.I am looking out on the lake front and fuming as I see a handful of people every day violating the closure, but not me. They don't enforce it but they don't open it up -- until recently, only police officers often in groups of 5 or 6 were enjoying the beauty of biking the lake front but now there are always a handful of walkers and joggers. Wish they would open these things with mandatory masking."
"We have walked along the lakefront from Belmont Harbor south to Fullerton a couple times recently without being hassled. We passed some joggers and cyclists also. Cops saw us. I think as long as folks are not engaged in risky behavior, violations are being ignored. Of course it it gets crowded, the police won't be able to ignore it."
"Chicago’s Millennium Park has reopened, with restrictions on the number of people who can visit and social distancing rules meant to limit potential coronavirus exposure, the city announced.The park will be open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., for groups of 10 or fewer wearing face masks, city officials said. Maggie Daley Park will reopen also.https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
Is Maggie Daley open now?
https://maggiedaleypark.com/ - yes
Lakefront Trail opens 6/22. Beaches still closed.
Outdoor bars open Wednesday.

"Lincoln Park Zoo is making plans to reopen when we hit Phase 4. Similar to the Botanic Garden, entry is free but everyone requires a reservation and a timed entry to maintain strict capacity limits. Unlike the Botanic Garden, the Zoo will allow walk-ups but entry is not guaranteed. If the Zoo is at capacity, people without an advance reservation will have to wait until there is space for them.The Zoo will open only outdoor exhibit spaces, no animal buildings, and limited food and bathroom facilities open. The train and carousel will not operate. Chats and programs will not be held. Every visitor over the age of 2 will be required to wear a face covering while on Zoo grounds."
"If you walk or bike to the Botanic Garden, you do not need a reservation. And they just announced a further reopening of more areas starting next week, also by reservation. I went Sunday and did the perimeter walk, so nice to be back, even though I totally missed tulip season."
The city also plans to announce the Monday reopening of The 606 Bloomingdale Trail. https:/…
Indoor dining starts on the 26th = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
