"At the moment, Public Health England is advising that screening incoming passengers is not a required or effective way of keeping the UK public safe, so this is not being done at Heathrow Airport. Other measures to protect public health are in place and passengers are asked to observe social distancing. Some countries do require passengers arriving in their country to be screened before departure, so screening for those departing passengers will take place at Heathrow.Edited: 12:54 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"Airport screening tends to be taking temperatures with the forehead thermometer, which isn't accurate or comprehensive. Heathrow wasn't doing any type of screening on March 17, when I arrived."
"There is no way of knowing (on 11 April) what procedure may or may not be in place in June. I know that didn't help you, but everything is moving so fast, there is just no way we can answer your question."
"Screening, or even quarantining, arrivals makes sense if you are still in a “containment” strategy, not so much once you get to “mitigate”. Expect it to return with a vengeance once the outbreaks are under control."
"It's international travel that spread the virus pretty quickly, so I'm pretty confident that once more people start travelling about again, the virus will return to bite us all on the backside.International arrivals are, to my mind, a big danger."
Kernewes so glad you are back I had been wondering about you. 45 hours travel makes my 36 seem like nothing.
"Re post 7 ... surely the priority, if possible is getting people home.If any screening is to be done it has to be done where they are being quarantined. Then if they have the virus they stay where they are.Do you actually expect them to contract the virus during their flight home?CheersAnthony K"
WHO guidance is very clear that there is no point in stopping flights into a country that has the virus passing between its citizens already. As and when we get to a stage where it isn't it would be different but we're a long way from that right now.
"I'm curious about your landing at Heathrow and returning to Cornwall without (apparently) any hassle. My wife and I will be flying next month into Heathrow from California and driving out to Cornwall. If the situation then is like what it is now, should we anticipate being able to make our way out there without a major problem?Thanks."
"My post (#15) was directed to Kernewes in post 10. By the time I finished my posting, several other posts had appeared so my inquiry may not have been clear. In essence, should my wife and I anticipate that we can land at Heathrow next month and drive to Cornwall without a hassle?Thanks again."
Randolph RAm I to assume that you are flying in to the UK with the purpose of visiting Cornwall for pleasure.If so the area is currently on lock down with many people confined to their homes except for food shopping and medicine.I have seen posts from locals asking that people do not visit the area
"Depends on what happens to the restrictions between now and then,and why you are coming. The UK has not banned incoming US nationals, so far as I am aware, but has required people to stay at home here. If you or your wife are UK residents coming back home, that should be OK. No, we are not currently testing at the airports for the reasons already stated, and although there is a possibility you will be stopped by the police and asked why you are driving towards what is a holiday destination, you would be within your rights if going back home, provided you don't have any symptoms.If, however, you are coming for a holiday, and intend to do so regardless of restrictions that might still be in place, then a) you shouldn't be, and b) you would not be welcome. I won't say more, because I'm assuming that's not the reason, but if it is you should seriously reconsider unless restrictions are lifted by then."
"Randolph, you could find yourselves being stopped by the police to check that your journey is essential. Is your accommodation still open or has it been closed and expects to be open next month?Edited: 10:14 am, April 13, 2020 "
"RandolphNo one can say what the situation will be like next month but I doubt very much your journey will be possible. I say that in the context of your destination not your point of arrival. Here’s some recent guidance/info for youhttps:/…https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cornwalll…Residents and the police are being very proactive in reporting visitors arriving/staying in the area. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cornwalll…I don’t know the purpose of your visit or where you plan to stay but I live partly in London and partly in Cornwall. I’m currently in London, having returned here from Spain in early March. I wouldn’t consider travelling to my home in Cornwall. Equally, if I had flown into Cornwall I would not have considered travelling to my home in London In any case, unless things change significantly you’ll discover that pubs, shops, restaurants, tourist sights etc are closed and social distancing means you’ll face further restrictions."
"Randolph, I’ve just noticed one of your other threads and realise your trip to Cornwall is part of what seems to be a road trip. Some people may consider it too early to consider cancelling the trip; I can only say that, if it was me, I’d cancel or, at least, postpone the visit for several months. In any case, you should check that any accommodation you’ve booked is still open. If you still plan to go ahead be sure to book fully refundable rates."
">>should my wife and I anticipate that we can land at Heathrow next month and drive to Cornwall without a hassle?<<I had a visit to Cornwall planned for May (from London) and reluctantly decided to cancel. My host said they've been told not to take any further bookings and to block off all bookings through April. They've gone a step further and blocked off May as well, since the country hasn't apparently hit the peak yet, so resuming travel within a few weeks is unlikely.Even if restrictions have started to be lifted (and it's likely that a phased reopening will take place rather than all at once), what will be open there? If restrictions are still in place and you plan to shelter-in-place in a lovely part of the world... how will you get groceries? Many of these are small towns, so restocking empty shelves isn't necessarily easy. And locals might not be thrilled that you're buying up toilet paper and other things in short supply.(Lots of celebrities apparently have been fleeing to their second homes in Cornwall, stirring up quite a bit of local resentment. https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/… )If you get ill, does the town where you're staying have the capacity (and expertise) to handle COVID-19? Is there a hospital nearby? The proper equipment? Enough staff?"
"I too would like to know what Randolph's current plans are. About a month ago he confidently predicted that the UK would be past the worst long before his expected trip at the end of May and into June.While none of us can predict what tomorrow will bring, let alone 6 weeks - ish from now, I don't think expecting this trip to go ahead is wise.On the other hand, his great concerns on the other topics were traffic and driving times. Owing to the fact there's almost no traffic and none of the attractions or eating options open, he'd do those journeys in record time if the police don't stop him.SWT"
"Randolph, bear in mind it isn’t just in Cornwall that there are problems with accessing medical care, it’s the other places you've said you intend to visit too. for example, in London people actually in hospital are testing positive for Covid 19 yet are still being discharged because there aren’t enough beds. Many of the hospitals have been designated as specialist centres so even if you have something serious other than Covid 19 you may still not be admitted or may be discharged before you’ve fully recovered. That’s bad enough if you live here but if you don’t have a home where would you stay until you’re declared fit to fly? I’m sorry if we all sound negative but please keep watching the news and check your travel insurance. Note: it’s unlikely to cover Covid 19 unless you took it out some time ago."
We fully appreciate all of your postings and have no intention of going to England next month if the restrictions are still in place.
">>We fully appreciate all of your postings and have no intention of going to England next month if the restrictions are still in place.<<Even if restrictions are not in place, it might still be too soon. Keep in mind that the risks will be lower when things open up, but not gone. I'd probably put off vacation travel for at least a month after restrictions are lifted. If testing is available by then, I'd want to take a test to know if I have immunity (and that I don't have the virus). And I'd only want to travel if the majority of restaurants and attractions are open and there aren't shortages of everyday items.Edited: 5:12 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Randolph, I predict that next month you are 'very' unlikely to be doing (what seems to be) your planned tourism/road trip in England and river cruise in France. Many reasons."
"Our next 2020 trip will be in October to London then down to France for driving through Normandy and Brittany (no river cruises). SWT will probably chastise my predicting that by that time, we will be through this. If not, the world economy will be in tatters."
"The world economy is possibly already badly damaged. How badly, and where is worst impacted, it's far, far too early to tell. After 2008, it took many countries a long, long time to recover. And folk were not dying in large numbers then, goverments weren't paying folk to stay at home when they could work and actually had jobs, whole industries were not shut down. Nothing, could have possibly have envisaged this scenario we are in. It's not too far fetched to suggest it's akin to some sort of end of the world movie, except that there are no hunky or gorgeous movie stars in it, and it won't have a happy ending. And it's neither a dream not a nightmare but all of our shared realities, wherever we are and however badly impacted we are.You are welcome, Randolph to predict whatever you wish. After all, neither of us has a crystal ball. Also, being positive and hoping for the best I've read is better for anybody's mental health that dreading the opposite, and wallowing in gloom, doom and self pity.Just one serious question - you are not expecting to rent a car in the UK for your UK meanderings and then taking that same car on a ferry or the shuttle to continue your trip in northern France and leave the car there, were you?SWT"
"In October, we'll be flying into Heathrow, taking a taxi to a hotel next to the St. Pancras station and then, after a few days, taking the Eurostar to Paris where we will pick up the car.A major difference between 2008 and now is that government agencies in 2008 were not shutting down the economy. In fact, until now, government shutdowns were considered a bad thing. There is of course a medical justification to an extent of what is now happening; but there are some people, including ""experts,"" who cavalierly predict this will last for months and we had better get used to it. If it lasts for months, we will have to get used to a recession/depression."
"If anyone thinks things will be back to normal by next month then then you are seriously underestimating just how bad things are.Let's look at the Czech Republic who have got off very lightly compared to the UK and who went into lockdown a week earlier than the UK. And not forgetting that the Czech people have followed the lockdown rules, regulations and advice a lot better than the thousands of eejits in the UK who think that the 2 metre rule and stay at home rule etc doesn't apply to them. This timeline was announced today by the Czech Minister of Industry and Trade and Transport Karel Havlíček:Dates for re-opening shops, restaurants, and services in the Czech Republic: April 20: - Farmers markets - Tradesmen with shops - Car shops and showrooms - Outdoor athletic areas for professionals, without spectators - Weddings of up to 10 people, following hygiene rulesApril 27: Shops under 200 square meters in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5000 square meters and those specified to open at a later dateMay 11: - Shops under 1000 square meters in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5000 square meters and those specified to open at a later date - Driving schools - Gyms and fitness centers (but not changing rooms or showers)May 25: - Outdoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops with outdoor sales and garden seating areas - Barbershops, hairdressers, nail salons, tanning salons, cosmetic salons, massage parlors - Museums, galleries, and art halls - Zoos (outdoor areas only)June 8: - All shops in shopping centers - Shops over 1000 square meters in size outside of shopping centers - Indoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops - Hotels and other accommodation providers (and their restaurants and cafes) - Taxi services - Tattoo and piercing studios - Theaters, castles, chateaux and other cultural activities according to the current regulations - Mass events for a specified number of people - Cultural, business, and sports events for less than 50 people - Weddings following specific hygienic protocol - Indoor areas of zoosSource:https://news.expats.cz/coronavirus-in-the-czech-republic/breaking-czech-government-outlines-five-step-plan-for-re-opening-shops-restaurants/?fbclid=IwAR3DlbGW4IN_8iJsqRjq2Icq_fUgRTpVUmEibYJ1api4ubckhrcWxf-lsF8I really hope that barber shops in the UK are back open by the end of May, because by then I will look a right mess! ;-)Edited: 2:09 pm, April 14, 2020 "

"One more thing, here are the up to date coronavirus figures for Czech Republic:Confirmed - 6101Recovered - 642Deaths - 161Compare that to the UK!"
"#32 Simple comment - “In October, we'll be flying into Heathrow, taking a taxi to a hotel next to the St. Pancras station” er, the Tube will be much cheaper and there’s a decent chance it will be faster..., don’t set your expectations More complex comment - “There is of course a medical justification to an extent of what is now happening; but there are some people, including ""experts,"" who cavalierly predict this will last for months”———/ - the “recession” is a matter of weeks away - have you seen the unemployment statistics is both our countries? “...to an extent...” LOL how many need to die to justify it?"
"'There is of course a medical justification to an extent of what is now happening' To an extent - what? Yes, there are other infectious diseases that are extremely nasty and which have high mortality rates, but given that this is a new organism and no person had any natural immunity to it before the outbreak (if anyone did I'd join the queue to speak to them), that there's no disease-modifying treatment, no vaccine, and that it can present asymptomatically hence transmission without knowledge of it took place for weeks, I'd say there's more than 'an extent' of medical justification for the current state of things. 'but there are some people, including ""experts,"" who cavalierly predict this will last for months and we had better get used to it.' I don't think anyone will 'cavalierly predict' but will take the data available along with evidence from other pandemics and modelling (although the latter is not always the gold standard for decision making) and consider the best way to put the brakes on this in the short term to give health care providers some room to manoeuvre and care for those gravely ill, with the knowledge that viral transmission is likely no matter the best efforts of many. 'If it lasts for months, we will have to get used to a recession/depression.' The measures in place may need to be continued at least through the summer if not longer although modifications will be made as the disease progresses. In terms of a recession it's already here, but different from those in the past 30 years in that few economies have had the luxury of avoiding it (although the Teflon-coated 1% will always have options, but that's another matter)."
Matt PoolIs it fair to compare the UK with the Czech republic?Their total population is only just bigger than London and Heathrow being a major transit airport for many other places probably contributes to our larger figure
"I think it is a good comparison.That is the timeline for ""getting back to normal"" for a country with a smaller population and with less people infected.How can the UK, with a much larger population and many more people infected, follow a similar timeline? But knowing this government...!"
">>but there are some people, including ""experts,"" who cavalierly predict this will last for months and we had better get used to it.<<Just because you don't like the prediction, doesn't mean it's incorrect. Economic problems can be solved ""to an extent"" by governments throwing money at them. It's not ideal, but it's possible. Once people die because things opened too early or too quickly, no amount of money can bring those people back to life.I saw an article today that explained why COVID-19 is so different from previous epidemics like SARS and H1N1. The short, unscientific version is, it is easier to transmit (up to half the people who have it show no symptoms) and is far more deadly than those other viruses, plus nobody had immunity yet since it's a new virus.The good news is that when the second wave hits, many folks will have acquired immunity, so it shouldn't be as massive a problem."
"I base my opinions on what I hear from doctors and scientists. My opinion is that the virus is more dangerous than was initially though, and I admit to being someone who didn't take it very seriously at first.However, it has become more and more apparent o me that this thing is not likely to melt away any time soon, and could easily keep coming back in waves - especially if travel starts heading back to something approaching what it used to be.For me, at least, the question has to be whether we prioritise human being or the economy. And for me, it has to be the former. That is why I don't particularly want to go outside the UK until there's a vaccine, and I don't really want anyone coming here until it's safe to do so either.Edited: 7:08 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Randolph , of course nobody knows what will happen in October but I read yesterday that the Tour de France has now been postponed and is now taking place 28Aug - 20 Sept . Now who knows if it will go ahead but the French obviously think it will so it seems there will be some sort of movement. However perhaps it will only be domestic movement within France. You may well get to France ......"
