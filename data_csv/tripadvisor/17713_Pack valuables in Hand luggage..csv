Apparently you cannot highlight theft or concerns about Baggage handling at Burgas for fellow holiday makers. It wasn't supposition - it was a fact. Please be careful as to what you pack. My last post highlighting the epidemic of suitcase theft was pulled by administrators!!
Do you mean the bourgas baggage handlers post? I can still see it its just bumped down the forum
Yes still there . And i am guessing most people put valuable item in hand luggage when transitting through any airport.Atb steveEdited: 3 years ago
