Someone just informed me that there are deadly jellyfish in the keys....is this true (my son was stung badly in Barbados and i do not need a repeat)
"We visited Sombrero Beach last Sunday and there were the remains of dead jellyfish floating around in the water and laying on the beach. My 10 year old, who loves the water, but would not dare to go in the water because of the jellyfish. They totally freaked her out, even if they were dead. We also saw a couple in the marina where we were staying. Tuckeraboo"
"I've never managed to go to any Atlantic coast beach without seeing jellyfish. I've usually seen them washed up and dead on the beach, but sometimes I've seen a few floating around in the water.The worst I have ever seen them was in October on a snorkeling trip out of Key Largo from John Pennekamp SP. They warned us right before we got to the reef that we ""might see a few jellyfish in the water"". We were SHOCKED to see THOUSANDS (literally) and everyone on the boat got stung at least once. Some people reacted much worse than others.If you know your son is really sensitive to them, you'll need to look out for them. Unless you avoid the coast altogether, I'd expect you to see them anywhere on the beach."
"What about at Bahia Honda? We will be there next week. Do they have problems there with jellyfish?, I haven't heard of any problems at BH."
"I've personally never seen any at BH in the 3 times we've gone, but I can't say you'd never see them."
I dive alot here in the Keys and we have jellys all year round. The jellys that you are worried about are called Box Jellys and we do not have them here. We do have maneuver's which are clear in the water with long tenticles that aray out from under his hood. But they are not normally is shallow water and if they are they are dead floating in. You will see them sometimes on the beach they are blue when they are dead. We also have just paln old jelly fish if you come in contact with one they sting for a while but us vinegar on the site and the sting will go away. If you are planning on getting in the water wear a rash guard. You can buy them at any dive shop Divers Direct. I dive all the time but I never get in the water without skin protection not only for the sun but if I brush up against fire coral or jellys brush up against me. Yes Jellys are on both sides Gulf and Atlantic. Just pick which ever place that looks better to you and have a good time. Always wear a rash guard when you go in the wter better safe than hurting till you can get to the vinegar. Carry a 50/50 water and vinegar bottle with you. 
"We get small man o wars here, but they aren't deadly unless you get into a ""pack"" of them :>). They are very easy to see, and not here year round. The jellyfish are not something to stress about. They bring out the Turtles too."
Don't listen to Bluewater- she is actually a jelly fish trying to lure you into the water.Don't let jellyfish or sting rays keep you from enjoying your time in the keys.
Funny M!! :>) 
"Yes, there are jellies -- it's the ocean.But they're not epidemic anywhere -- and the beaches will be posted as such."
This is something I've been so worried about...eeek!
