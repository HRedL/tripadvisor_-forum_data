"Does anybody know the current Chikungunya situation on PR? Just wondering how prevalent it is still? Still epidemic? Having plans to visit, and concerned now as some of the places I hope to visit, like El Yunque, seem like I would be walking right into a personal case of it. Not too thrilled about having to slather on chemicals to repel mosquitoes for my vacation...doesn't sound particularly relaxing if I have to worry about that. Are there fumigating measures taken at the various resorts and in San Juan? Thanks."
"According to the CDC, the following countries and territories in the Caribbean have reported chikungunya cases:Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Curacao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Virgin Islands, and Venezuela. So where were you thinking of going?From the peak in the beginning of December, with 10,000 infected, this has dropped to 4,000 at the end of December. I can not find any more recent numbers, but I assume the lack of news is a good thing as the news lives for raising excitement where there should be calm."
"It is not epidemic anymore. It reached epidemic levels bc it was a new virus, plus a lot of cases of flu or dengue were lumped into chikunguya.The flu is more prevalent now, as it is in the states. Mosquitos are not a terrible problem. Just wear some repellent during daytime activities and you will be fine."
"Was thinking of Rio Grande and El Yunque area. Pretty lush and wet area, hence my concern..."
The eastern side of the island receives more direct wind than in other areas. This reduces the carbon dioxide and reduces the mosquito population in that area. Remember mosquitos are drawn by carbon dioxide.
"The dry season brings less mosquitoes, but always use insect repellent day and night...just in case."
