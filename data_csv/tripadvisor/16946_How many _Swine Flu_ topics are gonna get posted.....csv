"Anyone concerned about the recent publicity regarding the swine flu outbreak should really be looking at the foreign office website, airline websites and health organisation websites. Nobody on here can answer specific questions about this topic as none of us know the full extent of the problem. It would not be fair for this site to have individual topics to be posted questioning travel to Orlando in realtion to swine flu, and overrun this specific forum."
"Oh no, they've started already!"
"Well that's 3 now, including yours. LOLIf we're running a sweepstake can I guess 3 more between now and me going home at 4:30 BST. :-)"
gotta love 'em!
It's a pandemic!Leeds
I think its going to be an epidemic
"Club,how many would you like lol?"
"""The EU's health commissioner today urged Europeans to postpone non-essential travel to Mexico and the US"" according to this morning's Guardian (as well as the New York Times and other news sources). In the US, a key source of information is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/There doesn't seem to be anything to report from Florida yet."
I'm not sure what I'm more scard of now: swine flu or crime on I-drive!If I get approached by a masked person who sneezes......Leeds
"Obviously with the huge hype in the media there are going to be many international visitors concerned. Have you noticed that the headlines are all things like ""DEADLY FLU KILLS SCORES OF PEOPLE"" then 3 columns down they get around to mentioning that there have been no deaths in the US and most people only have mild flu symptoms and recover?"
ACHOOdoes anyone have a tissue
Well a holiday to Florida IS essential! LOL!
it is when you've forked out near 4 grand!Leeds
We fly out Thursday. Hoefully the plane will be empty and no queues at the parks.. oink oink!!lol!!!
"If Europeans are supposed to stay away, what are we supposed to do who already live here? I think I need to get a mask like the people on TV! Maybe this will change the Touring Plans crowd levels for next week. We shall see!"
seeing as I am jewish does that mean I am immune
CPTThey will add a new column on their tables - Swine Flu Rating. The crowd level and this new rating will be inversely proportional!Leeds
"Cockney, you might partially immune if you had a parent alive in 1918 lol. My husband's mother was.Actually, large portions of population may have some small immunity to this virus, as it includes part of a previous human flu gene sequence and anyone who had that strain before and recovered may have partial immunity to this new strain."
I'm with Leeds on this one. After paying nearly 5 grand I will swim the atlantic if I have to lol.
If i end up in any long queues when i am there I am gonna pretend to sneeze!! A florida hiliday is definately essential travel. I have been planning this for 2 years!! Not to mention the budget holiday last year to save pennies!!
"Noodle, my fellow Leodensian, I said the same thing earlier today to my work colleagues lol the best workaround for massive queues is a tissue and an almighty sneeze!Leeds"
Far too many!!I always sneeze when I get on the plane. That should be fun.lol
Bio suits are the way to go! makes a change from speedos
well i go next friday and have just got back from asda getting a few bits for the hol and i asked one of the assistants in the isle if they had any swine flu tablets and they said they will find out and went off to find out!!!!!! haha me and my g/f moved on!!
I just had a text from a friend saying the couple in scotland with Swine flu are from falkirk. Thats where I live. Dont worry I wont be panicking.
I'm in Falkirk too Geraldine.....does that mean we'll soon be sporting a nice look in blue masks?
Ohhh can I have a mickey mask? with 'ears'??
"we've been advised to wear face masks, gloves and use hand sanitizer because we are working onboard passenger aircraft (on the ground) but the virus can remain in the mask so we have to change them at least twice per day and dispose of them for burning. "
Sorry plane wont be that empty as we fly out then too and are still going but was hoping the parks may be a little quite.
"I know it isnt particulary correct, but myself and one of my colleagues are both travelling to the states, myself Orlando and her L.A. We are both hoping this will affect the US dollar rate of exchange before we travel on 23rd May :)If they cancel the flight I shall be screaming at someone......Two years in the saving...my 6 year old will be devastated....Im sure it wont happen!!"
"Clubworldfan, this is a public forum...and as far as I was concerned other people could freely post about what ever topic they liked once it related to travel.Swine flu is a topic many people are going to need advice on, and not many of the sites are giving travel advice and/or advice on how long they think this will last.Its a Big Deal after all....."
"This is a public Orlando forum, not general travel (mexico has the only current travel advisory) Just wondering if there is really any need for 7 spearate topics on the same non specific chit chat that is better suited to a visit to the CDC website ot WHO info?"
Bump
stop that Chinners ;-)
"When out walking the dog this morning I had this sudden urge to roll around in the muck. Could I have caught swine flu? Will it be safe to travel?To my friends out there in Falkirk, you can't travel because you need to go up and you are going down !! Come on the ACCIES !! :)"
How often do you get these strange urges to roll in muck? Are they escalating? Can you post your photo so we can take evasive action lol?
hope you are gonna shower before you travel 
"As I said in the other topics for pig flu, we leave Saturday for Orlando. Ya'll need to stay away while I am there. I am going to take photos of anyone in a mask, why I don't know, but I am. Starting with my morther in law who is already talking about needing masks for our trip."
"I wish my mother-in-law would wear a mask when we all go to Orlando, preferably one of those full face ones for chemical wars"
Am very worried about the face mask issue..... Could get some really bad tan lines :o)Lovin this thread peeps
"Sorry guys couldn't get any decent photos of me covered in mud (only indecent ones !)Just a thought on the masks, I'm sure Disney could cash in on this and make Donald Duck Masks for us all to wear.............. They could put it on your bill !!"
"From my other favorite site, HotUKDeals...amazon.co.uk/gp/â€¦"
"If Disney have got their commercial heads on, they could sell those face masks in the parks and make a killing - i can just picture masks made to look like you have a Donald Duck beak, or a Pluto nose. Could be onto something here. Could sell them as a package with the M&M's."
