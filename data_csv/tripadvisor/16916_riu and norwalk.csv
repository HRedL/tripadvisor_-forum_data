"This is what it is .... ""People get Norwalk virus infection by swallowing food or water that has been contaminated with stool from an infected person. Outbreaks in the United States are often linked to eating raw shellfish, especially oysters and clams. Shellfish become contaminated via stool from sick food handlers or from raw sewage dumped overboard by recreational and/or commercial boaters. Contaminated water, ice, eggs, salad ingredients, and ready-to-eat foods are other sources of infection."" There you have it, plus with all the sick people running around the resort, they are passing it around....  "
"By the way are some kind of doctor, because that is notwhat my doctor found. Well anyway what is the differencepeople are getting ill, so until Riu will find out why, that should not accept any guests. And if you true what you saying thatthis is Norwalk virus, the cruise ships cancel the cruise immediately. O yes people get ill anywhere but not on this scale.I had food poisoning in Switzerland, so what from whole groupi was the only one."
"This is on a Norwalk site that that information came from, I didn not make it up, and by the way in Toronto, there have been people back from the Riu that have been diagnosed with Riu, and others with inconclusive results. Salmonella, Shigella or other enteric pathogens, which are bacteria would have been found in stool cultures, which is another type of food poisoning. Have you talked to anyone that just got off of a cruise? Well I have, and they shared that information with me. "
"sorry for the bad typing...,,there have been people diagnosed with Norwark in Toronto,,and others with inconclusive results."
"When 1 or 2 people get ill on cruise i do undrestand, butjust recently 150+ people got ill on Royal Caribean cruiseand the cruise was canceled. You can get ill anywhere, but what is going in Riu complex in Puerto Plata is almost likeepidemic. I guess we have a difference of opinions and justlet be."
"sig,,it was alot more that 2 or 3 people, it was not epidemic. "
"Anyone in the know, is it spreading throughout D.R. and are there any precautions you can take? We leave this Sunday with kids and I am concerned for their safety! We are going to La Romano so I don't even know if it is a concern for me but I am worried people say it is airborne. Thx!!!"
"beachbummI really don't think the people dealing with this know yet what has caused the illnesses. Sunquest states it is airborn, which as you know is quite serious and extremely difficult to contain and manage, yet media reports state it is a hotel problem. However, on the gov. travel advisory, it reports, gastroenterits outbreak in dominican republic.Personally, we were scheduled to travel to puerto plata in February, and we have switched to mexico instead. Good luck"
"from what I have read,,some people have been diagnosed with Norwalk, and others had inconclusive results. As far as I know, this has mostly affected the Riu complex, and there have not been too many complaints about the other hotels. I have never been to La Romana, but I her its great...have fun"
"Norwalk?? I'm not sure. My observation, we were there between Dec. 20th and Jan 3rd. 4 for 4 sick and we all went to the doctor after the Sunquest rep., on site, insisted we take our son to the doctor when he got sick. After an injection and antibiotics within a few days he was feeling much better. He was afraid to eat but feeling better. When my husband got sick, he too went to the doctor, IV medication and antibiotics and within afew days feeling better, not great but better. Same with my other son and myself. I definately noticed a difference in recovery between those that went to the docotr and those that did not. Coincedence or not???? I am not a doctor but it is my non-medical knowledge that tells me that antibotics do not help viruses. We had antibiotic, got better quicker. Go figure!!!"
jangal you seem to switch back and forth alot. I do believe it was an epidemic!
I have an idea that noone has mentioned yet-actually several LOL. Maybe the water supplied to the hotels is contaminated. Maybe the hotel water supply has been contaminated form a source like the lagoon or from the cows in pasture behind the Mambo. November and December have had alot of rain. If the runoff is coming down from the pasture then maybe that's where the contamination might be coming from and entering the hotels water supply if it's from a well? Just an idea-being on a farm I know the laws for handling manure are very strict. Yes I know it's alot of maybe's but there has to be a source for the problem.It didn't appear out of thin air. 
Thanks for your answers all! It does seem to make sense that it could be an infected water supply! I sure hope they get to the bottom of it. I feel for all of you who got sick and hope you all get well soon!
"snowy,,I was talking about a ship, where there were people sick,not the Bachata,,where I was,,I know about the outbreak there.I do know what I am talking about."
