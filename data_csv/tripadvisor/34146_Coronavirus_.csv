We have a trip booked for the end of April. Wondering if anyone has reported on signs of it being in Portugal and/or on the islands?
Who knows what the situation will be like in 2 months time? It might have landed in Texas by then.
"I am positive it will have, you are correct."
"Now Feb 27, at 5pm there were 18 possible cases in the mainland, 17 negative and the 18 is waiting for the lab analysis. In 2 month time it will be almost impossible not to have an imported case, at least here in the mainland..."
Thank you so much for answering my question. :) I appreciate it.
"Sheri, I am also concerned. We have a Portugal trip planned for mid-May. I have four plane tickets and everything else is cancellable. I know some airlines are waiving cancellation penalties. Not sure if TAP will allow it if it spreads to Portugal. But, I really am hoping things clear up by then. This is a long-awaited trip and it is really tough to know at the moment."
"If there is any risk airlines will take the appropriate action, however,it is not expected to be a long drawn out problem and will be dealt with accordingly. No one knows what will happen over the coming weeks and fortunately it is not an issue in Portugal presently"
"First case reported in Terciera, Azores."
"It's not the 1st case, it's a case that is under investigation (a person that has arrived from Milan on Feb 19), it can be negative like all the others were, or not..."
"To me,there is not a lot of point worrying. Just come to PT and enjoy your trip.As previously said,there is every possibility of cases arriving in the US. It may be safer here in Portugal. Rest assured the medical authorities are keeping tabs on everything that is happening probably as well as in the US."
@bedouin Cases have already arrived in the US. Your statements are misleading.
"I also have trip from March 19 - April 1 to Portugal and Spain, my wife worries a lot, and the real risk may actually during the flight, she is thinking to cover whole body with big clear garbage bag when in airplane"
"Wait and see, but in the meantime check with your travel insurance company and your airline on what their policies are now or may be in the future should travel be prohibited by governments or when airlines start cancelling flights.I don't recall what happened during the SARS virus scare in 2003 and there have been also Zika virus outbreaks more recently. There may be lessons there.In the meantime I can assure you that life goes as normal here."
"I guess it is all ""What if?"" I know that I am not planning to change my travel plans to Europe in late April/May. Years ago on a trip to Croatia, a guy (BOS to Frankfurt) in front of me was very ill and coughing constantly. About a week into our marvelous trip, I got ""it"". Thankfully, I always carry plenty of good over the counter medication and while I wasn't perfect, I only really had one down day feeling miserable.WHAT a trip this was. A volcano in Iceland was ejecting volcanic ash and transatlantic flights were cancelled left and right. We got into Frankfurt just after they had been closed for a few days. On our way home via Munich, it was closed for two days after we left in the morning. You just never know when you travel. Yes, it is a risk to travel. Doesn't stop me..."
"I think many of us share the same concern, not so much about exposure to the virus as to possible quarantine.We have had our first case reported in our county - and this week I've had a fever, cold and cough. What would happen if I were trying to fly someplace? Only time will tell, fortunately our trip isn't until May so we have quite a while to watch how this unfolds."
"Feb 28, at 6pm the official bulletin was released with 59 possible cases, 57 negative and 2 is waiting for the lab analysis, this huge increase was due to people that were in the north of Italy recently."
Mathlady. According to press the 1st case was confirmed yesterday. so where am I misleading.I have also noticed from some of your previous posts that you can be quite discourteos.This is a travel blog..so no need to be reprimanding people.
I too am concerned was we will be in Ponta Delgada on Apr 18 for a week!!
"Yesterday's official bulletin, still no confirmed positive case, since the outbreak in Italy the number of possible suspects has increased exponentially https://www.dgs.pt/em-destaque/boletim-infor…"
Thank you so much for this information. Can you please reply if there is any changes in the situation?
"I will post today's official bulletin after being released, but it will change, it's impossible for Portugal to be without cases... while it was mainly China the possible suspects number remained very small, as soon as the outbreak in Italy happened the number increased exponentially so we will have imported cases."
Well I am not going to Ponta Delgada until April 18. I am concerned about Sao Miguel once the cruise ships begin to arrive. Many thanks!
Thanks for the updates. We too have a trip to Sao Miguel organised for June. That's a good point about the cruise ships increasing the risk once the season starts. Are the current cases only in mainland Portugal does anybody know?
https:/…countriesincluding Portugal
"That list shows Portugal has two cases among a population of about 10.3 million.If you cancel your trips before governments officially announce that you must not go or companies cancel flights and cruises, you will probably lose your money. Insurance will almost certainly not pay out unless and until travel to Portugal is banned or becomes impossible.Wait as long as you can before deciding. Meanwhile check what your insurance / airline / cruise company/ hotel etc would do in terms of a refund if you were to cancel of your own will."
"Yeah, we have a trip booked for around that time as well. And yes, on Saturday, the first reported case showed up on Terceira. https:/…"
"Levi - you have to check carefully what's written by tabloids, there are NO positive cases in Azores, there was one suspected which was a person that had returned from Italy. It was NEGATIVE.The now 2 confirmed cases are both in Porto region (so the mainland) and both imported, one from Italy and the other from Spain."
"Hi, I am planning to travel to Sao Miguel for 1 week from 14 March. I am expecting the virus will have reached the islands by then - just as it has in most other places."
"Update - yesterday's report, 4 imported cases (mainly from Italy) + 2 relatives/friends from one of those imported cases all in the mainland https://www.dgs.pt/em-destaque/relatorio-de-…"
AnnieM1 - what is your question?There are NO confirmed cases of the virus in the Azores. There are probably more near or where you live.Stay at home if you are at all worried. What can anyone else say?
"It is true, there is nothing more to say. I am surprised nobody from the Azores is wishing we would all stay away until the virus has resolved, to be honest. Not sure if I lived on a secure island that I would like people potentially bringing this in!As of now we will travel as planned. Things would have to change a lot for that to change at this point. We have looked forward to this adventure."
Yes. Suspected case already in the Azores.
"I am surprised nobody from the Azores is wishing we would all stay away until the virus has resolved - because all those coming from the mainland and the locals that took vacations in february (Carnival) in Italy and other european countries are already the potential carriers (as seen by the only suspected case till now). And since Portugal is not going to close the borders, till further notice, the Azores will not do it also.Now March 5, we have 9 confirmed cases in the mainland, 6 imported (almost all from Italy) and 3 relatives/friends from those imported."
"Let's just pray it stops there, for the sake of the people, not the sake of our trip."
We are also traveling 3/14 for one week. This was supposed to be exciting it is where my husbands family is from but now we are all nervous
"March 6 official report, still mainland and still imported cases that infected relatives/friends https://www.dgs.pt/em-destaque/relatorio-de-…"
Interestingly I have today received an email from Azores Airlines saying I can change my flights free of charge if I wish. I'm travelling out to Faial via Lisbon on 5 May.
"I wasn’t asking a question, merely stating the obvious - that there is no need to cancel the trip as the virus is likely to be worldwide and yes, it certainly is more widespread presently where I live."
That was 2 weeks ago that this was posted and its already there.. unless they order 100% lockdown quarantine for civilians and shut the country dow n for atleast 7-10 days this won't stop spreading. People wont show signs for 5-9 days sometimes longer and who knows if people can host the virus and never actually get sick they can continue to spread it unless they get tested and know they have it...
Is There any news?? I am going This! sunday and we have no news yet
"The news are that till now no case in the Azores, but in the mainland yes, 61 at this moment."
"I don't really have to worry unless Portugal goes to Level 2, 3 or 4 on the CDC rating scale. If they do, then I can't return to work until 14 days after I get back in the US. That time will only be paid if I have enough PTO to cover it.Edited: 10:53 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Announced today - Azores in a alert state until March 31 - recommends the postponement of travel, ""for any reason and by anyone"", from the region to the outside and from the outside to the region, ""except those absolutely essential"" .... also decreed the suspension of authorizations for docking of cruises and yachts in the ports and marinas of the region, except in cases ""duly authorized"" by the health authority. However, even they have to ensure that they ""do not disembark passengers""."
Thank you for this information. Is there a link to an official statement we can use to try and reschedule or get refunds?
"It's on the news in Portugal, since for now only the ""suspension of authorizations for docking of cruises"" seems to be only restriction the rest is still recommendation... even if it has that pompous name of ""alert state"", the Azores has not yet a positive case. So I doubt that it will be valid for reschedule or get refunds. But most of the european airlines are opening time windows for rescheduling without extra costs, now it's still probably only March. Can you check that with your airline?https://www.jn.pt/local/noticias/acores-grup…this is the site of the regional government, nothing is yet published there azores.gov.pt/Portal/…coRONAVIRUS_S1.htm"
"We leave Apr 1 from Toronto for A week in Sao Miguel. I am not concerned about the virus. I am, howver, concerned about potential flight cancellations for returning home or about the likelihood of ending up quarantined. Trumpy banned European travel yesterday, what If Trudeau takes similar action? Or, what if Sao Miguel businesses elect to close key sites like hot springs etc to proactively prevent spread? I don’t want to go all this way only to end up having a disaster of a time."
It’s definitely hard to know what to do. We have planned this trip for almost a year. We are scheduled for the end of April. Guess we will explore our options and see what happens. I have a feeling we are going to lose a big chunk of money.
"Now with the Trump announcement regarding the return from Europe for 1 month, you may also have a window of opportunity there..."
I am just waking and have not seen the news yet. Thank you for the heads up!
"Update - In a statement, the regional government explains that all people who disembark in the region until 31 March will be placed in ""prophylactic isolation (...) with active surveillance for 14 days after landing in the Autonomous Region of the Azores""."
Can you please give me a link to the official statement? I have a flight booked for tomorrow from Ireland and hopefully this way I will be able to get my money refunded from hotels etc.Thank you!
The official site in english azores.gov.pt/Portal/en/entidades/srs/notici…
"Due to fly out from UK tomorrow, this is a perfect storm of timing. We booked all the elements separately, so no package protection. Used CC and have travel insurance, but still not sure how all this might play out, given that Azores government seems to be saying ""stay away"" but FCO advice is still benign. Ryanair just keep saying ""your flight is still scheduled"" of course. I'm not sure if it would be worse, financially, to self-cancel or to go and then get quarantined/stuck."
"OK, so my hotel has finally told us that if we do travel tomorrow we will end up in 14 days quarantine, which isn't how we had planned to spend our week. So that answers the dilemma, there's no point going, even if we end up losing all the money. Meanwhile, Ryanair are still quite happy to deliver people into quarantine, and UK FCO appear unwilling to advise against travel."
Is there anybody which travelled to the Azores today ?
"I flew back from Portugal on 12th, everything was fine and the country was running normally from what I experienced. Restaurant owners were getting worried though."
"March the 12th reality has nothing to do with March 15th... so don't bother say that all normal 4 days ago, IT'S NO LONGER NORMAL."
For anyone booked with Azores Getaways Mar 15-Apr 30 they sent an email today indicating all trips are recommended to be re-booked and that they would do so at no charge. They say they will reach out to all travelers and are overwhelmed by volume of inquiries.
Everything is now restricted to essential travel. New arrivals to the Azores will be subject to 14 days quarantine.
"Hello, I'm living in the Azores, São Miguel Island. And as a professional of health, I think everybody should postpone their travelling to 3 or 4 months later, or find something to do at their own place. It's a public sanitary problem we are facing now. The peak of the infection, takes time and it hasn't still arrived here. So, naturally, being responsable not only for them selves but for the others too, it's the minimum we can do."

I haven't received any information from them and our holiday is booked for April 9th to Tricerria through Azores getaways. It says don't contact unless travel is in the next 72 hours. We hope to be able to reschedule but haven't heard anything.
"We were supposed to leave Apr 1 and also haven’t been directly contacted for the purpose of re-booking, only a general email advising we will be re-booked. All flights from toronto are cancelled effective today until Apr 14, so clearly a re-booking will have to happen."
Thank you. We haven't heard anything. No email yet even to say it will be rebooked. I understand they have a lot to deal with but it is hard. We just got back from Cancun and traveled home earlier than planned and paid extra to get home early as they wanted Canadian s to return home.
"We got an email last week from SATA cancelling our flight. They are refusing, however, to refund our money and are offering a ""voucher"" or to rebook within a year. Obviously our confidence in a voucher is pretty slim at this point and as an essential healthcare worker I have no idea when I will be able to take PTO again. I believe the European laws require them to refund us if they cancel the flight, but getting them to respond is like pulling teeth. They have said they will let us know ""a few months from now"". Any advice? AirBNB took good care of us. Hoping somehow SATA will as well.Edited: 11:12 am, April 06, 2020 "
"are offering a ""voucher"" or to rebook within a year - that's what all companies are doing now... because this is a pandemic and they have 99% (some are still doing rescue flights) of their fleet grounded. Maybe there will be a solution, but considering that they all will be bankrupted if all the cancelled bookings from end of March till June will be refunded I doubt very much that a win-win solution will be achieved..."
I am definitely not willing to donate $1200 to the airline plight.
"There is a U.S. Department of Transportation regulation which states that if the airline canceled your flight, and it is a flight either originating or ending in the U.S., the airline MUST refund your ticket price if that is what you want- it doesn't matter if it is a U.S. or foreign airline"
"I am definitely not willing to donate $1200 to the airline plight - it's your right, just be prepared for a long battle."
"I have same issue with SATA for my May 17 flight. Maybe we need to notify US Dept of Transportation to see if they can intervene. On top of that, I can't get the B&B to respond to my e-mails about re-booking. Quinta do Mar in Caloura."
"Dear sirs,Me and my vife planed to spend our vacations in Sao Miguel from july 14 to july 21 , booked Hotel and hided a car.What do You say about our wishes?Will the CORONA be beaten in that time?"
It’s is doubtful it will be over by then.I did get my money back from SATA last week.
"Will the CORONA be beaten in that time? No, it will stay around the world for much longer. Be aware of the region strict control of those arriving (in place now, who knows what's the protocol in July), here full info in portuguese https:/…A7ores.pdf the Azores have 4 different ""approaches"" to those arriving to the region:The first is to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 virus test within 72 hours before the flight departed for the Azores and the result was negative.Second option: consists of performing the screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the moment it disembarks. Then you will be taken to a hotel determined by the Regional Government of the Azores, where you have the obligation to remain in prophylactic isolation, until the result of the test. The maximum time limit for transmitting your test result is 48 hours.third option: voluntary quarantine for a consecutive period of fourteen days in a hotel indicated for this purposefourth option, which is to return to the place of origin of your flight or to travel to any airport outside the Autonomous Region of the Azores."
Do you know how long it takes to get the covid PCR result if you have it done on arrival? I know it's max 48 hours.. but surely they do it sooner?Gov.UK website says that the results arrives in 12 hours https:/…entry-requirements
"I know it's max 48 hours.. but surely they do it sooner? No it's not, count on 48h at least. Here you have the official info, no promises of how long it will take https:/…AAs_20200615_VF.pdf and the health form https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl… Because it takes so long they now have, for the Portuguese in the mainland, a number of labs that will do the test paid by the azores government if you present the flight ticket. My suggestion is do it at the UK."
