"A new policy is being discussed in the Knesset for opening flights to Israel. Prof. Groto, who now leads the Israeli Corona strategy, pushes towards the end of quarantine demand for anyone returning from a ""green"" country ( mostly European countries where infection rate is very low). A list of these countries is not available right now.Best wishesMalka Pollak"
"The list of ""green countries"" valid of course only for now is as follows:Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Greece, Germany, Danmark, Austria, Estonia, Finland, Cyprus, Canada South Korea, Malta, New Zealand. Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland.There is still lots of logistics to be solved, like Corona tests at the airports where passengers are leaving from.August 16th was indicated as a date to strive for....Let's hope all goes well until then.Best wishesMalka Pollak"
Now this information is found in Englishhttps://www.jpost.com/israel-news/health-min…Best wishesMalka Pollak
"Not that the UK (understandably) is on that list, but with a heavy heart, even if it was, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be coming with the state of the epidemic in Israel as it currently is."
"The list is very helpful but as a Canadian with low Covid cases at this time I would not want to travel to Israel with an extremely high number of cases and put myself at unnecessary risk and then on my return to Canada have to self isolate for 2 weeks.I'm hoping that the situation is vastly improved in Israel as well as our host countries in October/ November when I and many others would consider travel.Edited: 3:38 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Hi, same here. We would not be allowed to travel from Ireland to a country with the large amount of cases that Israel have. Even if you could, would anybody take such a risk. We are due to travel to Israel mid October but won't be travelling."
"And of course I write from the world center of COVID-19 where the pandemic is totally not being controlled. For that reason, I find it unlikely that my planned return in November will happen. That will make the ill-fated year of 2020 the first year since 2012 (I believe) that I will not have visited Israel. It's heartbreaking.I hope I'm wrong. I don't expect to be.Douglas Duckett"
"And rather that focusing just on my situation, I would be VERY glad if tourism from countries that have the pandemic under far better control picks up again. I know it's been absolutely devastating for the tourism industry, including many of our friends on here, and for the Israeli economy generally. May it happen soon -- and safely.Douglas Duckett"
"While the potential easing of flights is good news -- as many have said, I am sure that until Israel gets the Covid situation under better control, many people will put their visit off a bit longer.I truly appreciate Douglas' concern for the Israeli economy and for those of us who have been affected directly by this.We hope that within as short a time as possible things will go back to where they should be.Oreet"
"For the time being we have to learn to live with the virus and seriously adopt a routine where face masks and social distance are part of our personal responsibility for ourselves and our surrounding.It has become clear in other countries too, that a fast opening up of social activities encourages a new outbreak and unfortunately we do observe this also in some countries (Spain, Belgium, Australia).I believe we shall success to flatten the infection rate in Israel, which will eventually open the skies for us and for foreigners to enter. But also then, we shall have to follow restrictions ( like in many other countries too) .Best wishesMalka Pollak"
"I think its more than for the meantime, its like what 911 did on airport security. Masks, social distance etc are here to stay. I do really feel for all involved in the tourist industry in Israel and worldwide, many will have to change career."
"A press release from the Israeli Corona Cabinet on the evening of Wednesday, 5 August 2020 says, that the morbidity situation is worrying and that the goal is to significantly lower morbidity by 1 September 2020.Therefore, I can't imagine that the borders to Israel will be opened as of 16 August. On the other hand, I hope that in September or October travel to Israel will be possible again.Everyone has to decide for themselves under what conditions a trip to Israel makes sense. To take a decision for myself (and my ""environment"" at home) I would like to know, where Israelis get infected with corona (at work, from family members, public space…). Do such evaluations exist?"
ELAL has also suspended all flights until at least August 31.
I have family members in the tourism industry in Israel. I hope is a slowdown and stop to the virus in Israel and all over. I'm looking at Nov. 2021 as a goal for going back to Israel. We'll see.
"The open borders being discussed is that Israelis can visit certain 'green' countries and be allowed to return back to Israel without quarantine. There is no discussion yet of foreigners being allowed to freely visit Israel, at least not from the 'red' countries like most of Europe and N. America. Israel is trying to lower the number of people who have caught the virus. We have had over 200 people pass away from the virus in just over 2 weeks (the total who died is 565 since March).ChanaIsrael"
"# 11:The information given was probably referring to the high infection rate. The morbidity rate per capita in Israel is one of the lowest of Corona effected countries. This is probably due to the fact that Israel has a very high percentage of young population, while the older more endangered population abstains from public exposure. Also the level of medical care for Corona patients is very high in Israel with an impressive survival rate for high risk patients.High percentage of infection is noted in Jerusalem within the Jewish-orthodox and some Arab neighborhoods, where obviously social distance is less implemented.People do get infected most on public traffic and gatherings like indoor weddings, parties etc.Best wishesMalka Pollak"
"The mass Belz wedding last night won’t help the situation in Jerusalem. Where are the authorities to shut this down? A wedding with over 1,000 people, surely the police would have knowledge especially on Tu B’Av."
"Though some may not agree with me -- it seems to me that the best course of action on this forum is to continue to refrain from politics, especially when some of the comments are coming from people who are not here and are getting their information, or misinformation, solely from the media.Discussions regarding large social events, or which portions of the Israeli population do or do not adhere to Covid limitations verges on the political - especially since it will lead to discussions of other groups who also flout the regulations under the guise of a demonstration or protest.Please let's stay out of this completely and stick to facts - when we know that flights will be resumed, tourists will be allowed into Israel we will be the first to share that information -- all the rest, please - does not belong here."
"YZD: I like El Al and usually take this airline. But.. even today I would have a direct flight to Tel Aviv with another airline. Getting to Israel is no problem.weezlikestotravel: I hope that Israel opens its borders a long time before November 2021. For Europeans it's a short flight to get to TLV, so it's also worth to fly in for only some days and it can be organised more spontaneous.Chana: there were reports that the border would open again for tourists of ""green countries"" - and at the moment Switzerland is considered a ""green country"". But it's understandable to let Israelis travel again in a first step.HolylandMaps: Thank you for your valuable and detailed information. The press release was about the morbidity rate which is low per capita - but rose sharply in the last weeks.Oreet: I know what you mean and agree. On the other hand I find it important to know where contagion centres are and how to avoid them."
"There are lists of ""red, orange and green"" towns in Israel, according to their infection rate and eventual future restrictions will apply to ""red"" cities.The infection rate is the result of the average in Israel, while only 20 towns have a high rate. Tel-Aviv and Haifa are considered ""green"" cities, with a low infection rate. One also has to consider, that most of those tested as ""positive"" have no or minor symptoms, while of course they can infect others, and therefore need to quarantine.Today was also some talk about future incoming tourism and the authorities are reflecting on organized groups from ""green countries"" in about a month and half. They would not have to go into quarantine.I presume that all tourists would have to show a corona test from their home country.For Israelis it is planned that Corona tests should be available 24 hours before leaving on a plane The results should be available within 14 hours.Best wishesMalka Pollak"
#18. I also hope Israel opens up vefor Nov. 2021. That's the soonest that I will be able to visit due to my schedule in the upcoming year.
"Malka, the outbreak in Victoria, Australia wasn't due to reopening the economy too soon, but a failure of its state Premier to competently manage quarantine procedures of returning Australian citizens who were sequestered in hotels.Edited: 3:58 am, August 07, 2020 "
"I am planning a trip to Jordan/Israel early NEXT year. (some of you may remember my queries about border activity/ATM machines.I live in a 'green country', Canada. I started using a face mask since early April, and went to have a corona virus test (negative result). None of this was mandated by the state; it was voluntary.In the end, much of our lives is really a matter of social responsability. I intend to keep using a mask until I get a vaccine; if these countries want to re-open to foreign tourists; simply monitor the status of each relevant country (which is done anyways, i.e. terrorist threats), advise everyone to wear a mask and use hand sanitizer Until there is a credible vaccine available, that is all that we can do."
"Jennifer I'm in Canada like you and have done the same ;wear masks etc even before they were mandated indoors on transit etc.However as Canadians we are fortunate that we have a low population density of about 4 per km,the Australians about 3 per km. The U.S about 40 per km ,.Israel, Belgium,India about 400 per km.So notwithstanding the outbreak in Montreal and to a much lesser extent Toronto, Ottawa etc by virtue of our low population, huge area and low population density we Canadians are very fortunate indeed as are the Aussies as compared to the Americans, West Europeans and Israelis.While I have no great love for our Canadian leaders both federal,provincial, municipal etc all levels of our government as well as the population as done a good job especially compared to our Southern neighbours.There are particular challenges in Israel due to the very high population density, tourist industry and the major cities such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem etc are more densely populated than our Mid to large Canadian cities."
"We should also keep in mind, that the higher the testing rate is in a country, the higher the rate of infected ( not ill) people will be. The new minister of health introduced a much higher testing rate than before, bringing it to the highest in the world. So it is really very difficult to compare the infection rate between different countries.A number you can objectively compare is the morbidity rate per capita, and in this respect Israel is among the lowest in the Corona effected countries.Best wishesMalka Pollak"
"+1 to #24. In addition some countries are overstating their cases such as Belgium by assuming some deaths due to Covid,the numbers of other countries such as China are grossly understated and as Malka points out Israel's testing per capita is among world's highest but mortality rate is very low.Edited: 3:57 pm, August 09, 2020 "
Statistics can always be manipulated to say whatever the person wants them to say -- I have no inside track and no personal knowledge of any such manipulations this time - but I also know that in the US there were hundreds of deaths that were attributed to Corona - many which had to do with ceratin financial considerations for hospitals -- I personally know of at least two cases where individuals died of causes other than Corona and yet their death certificates listed Covid 19 as the cause of death.IMHO we are all putting forth all kinds of theories and assumptions when no one really has an answer.Hopefully Israel will have a plan soon that will allow for tourism to resume - and more importantly all over the world solutions will be found.
Optimistic outlook from Sar-el Tours! Cautiously optimistic. https:/…
"Any updates regarding crossing the border at Arava/Eilat from Jordan? I plan to come by land (from Jordan, which is another story), and leave by air (TLV)."
As of tonight - no changes yet
A far less optimistic take from today's Times of Israel:https:/…Douglas Duckett
"There is a grave misinformation in that article of Times of Israel.Israel DOES not have one of the highest morbidity rates in the world. On the very contrary!!Israel has a high infection rate connected closely to the very high rate of testing, among the highest if not even the highest world-wide, but at the same time Israel has ONE OF THE LOWEST MORBIDITY RATE per capita in the world.Just for comparison - for each 100.000 inhabitants the morbidity rate in Israel is 7, in Germany ( a green country) it is 11, in Canada it is 24, in USA it is 50 and in Great Britain 70.These numbers are based on the information published yesterday by Johns Hopkins University which monitors daily the Covid 19 development world-wideBest wishesMalka Pollak"
"#31 -confusing, but morbidity simply means having the disease, not to be confused with mortality (dying from it). Israel has relatively high morbidity right now but relatively low mortality."
"I think you meant ""mortality"", not ""morbidity""....Statistics aside (I should quote Mark Twain), the problem is that we have an ineffective and uncaring government that is doing absolutely nothing. It's every man for himself here and there is no reason to expect any improvement. Sorry for the morbid comment....."
"# 31 and 32thank you for correcting the meaning of ""morbidity"" which I indeed confused with the word ""mortality"", as usually for morbidity the expression "" infection rate "" is used.Best wishesMalka"
