"Sri Lankan authorities are reporting the 1st local coronavirus patient, a tourist guide, in the country. The previous case was a Chinese tourist who later fully recovered."
"As per a news report:First Sri Lankan patient infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus in the country has been identified last night (10), the Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe has said.The 52-year-old patient is a tour guide and he has recently provided services to an Italian tour group, a media release issued by the Presidential Secretariat said.Dr. Anil Jasinghe has said that the patient has been quarantined at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Angoda and treatment has been commenced.Chief Epidemiologist of the Ministry of Health Dr. Sudath Samaraweera has told media that the preliminary test conducted on the patient was positive for COVID-19.Measures have been taken to obtain information on the places visited by the Italian tourists and the people who had come into contact with them."
"Three more cases of coronavirus are now being reported in Sri Lanka, all of them people who came from Europe. The total of cases in the island is now 5."
"With India closing its borders, climbing numbers in both the US and UK, Europe now the epicenter of the Virus, Australia now cancelling all large outdoor gatherings, tourists from Russia and, ironically China, now seem the safest bet for Sri Lanka.What will be a concern to Sri Lanka will be readily available sanitary items such as hand sanitisers throughout the region. The crowded nature of Sri Lankan public transport will also present a risk.Based on the exponential spread in China and Iran, this may be a concern to the Sri Lankan Government who may be forced to follow India. If the US Health System isn't failing to keep up, this may be Sri Lanka's only option.It is going to be a real kick in the teeth to the economy and all Sri Lankans having barely recovered from the Terror Attacks."
"I can only hope, for Sri Lankans, that their government will do the only proper action, and will close the borders. There will be losses for tourism sector but on long term, losses when the coronavirus hits you are much higher.If doing this ethically i.e. allowing potential visitors to get refunds or free cancellation, and supporting local tourism business, Sri Lanka could become a positive example how to react in such moments of crisis."
The count is now 8. All cases still related to contact with people who traveled from outside the country.
"All new cases reported stopped at airport and quarantined. 4 rather silly tourists from Poland testing positive in holland and flying anyway, due to fly through to Russia."
"#4 The list of nations closing border is growing, especially those with no, or low case numbers, New Zealand has closed borders to all nations with the exception of Pacific Islands and banned all Cruises Ships till June, this follows India's blanket ban, as is also the case with Ukraine, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. The US has expanded it's ban to the UK and Ireland.Being relatively isolated it may just be a matter of time before Sri Lanka follow suite.Edited: 3:45 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Eugene, this is what I would do, if in charge of any of those countries. Short term losses will be much lower than long term problems if virus hits with a full force. Slovenia is starting to shut down nationwide. Not only the tourism sector, the whole industry in at risk. Those luckier then us (sharing a border with Italy) should learn and act quickly, and swiftly."
"It would appear Sri Lanka are, having just banned the UK, Norway and Belgium for 14 days effective today."
"As of today, the number of infected has gone up to 28."
"#10 This is truly devastating news for Sri Lanka and hopefully puts to bed the myth that Sri Lanka will be fine as it is a tropical nation.Since last Friday other temperate nations in Asia have seen a significant rise in cases, Malaysia has seen a jump of 258%, the Philippines 173%, Indonesia 294% and Pakistan 776%, even Singapore is up by 29%.New Zealand has closed its borders and even brought is quick changes to legislation for powers of deportation for tourists ignoring the 14 Day Self Isolation requirement on entry after several European Backpackers were interviewed at the airport on arrival, who when questioned said they'd be ignoring the Self Isolation rule. The Prime Minister quite bluntly stating ""if you don't self isolate, you're not welcome here.""I would imagine the same attitude will be encountered in Sri Lanka, all the more reason to close borders."

"The sharp upwards trend since the 10th of March when there was only one registered case to now stand at 44 has definitely caught the attention of the Sri Lankan Government with all inbound international flights banned from 4:00am Friday the 19th until midnight 7 days later on the 25th, at which time it will be reassessed. Hopefully it is not too late, but closing the borders was the only option.10-March-2020 1 case12-March-2020 2 cases13-March-2020 3 cases16-March-2020 18 cases17-March-2020 28 cases18-March-2020 44 casesThe next 3-4 days are going to be crucial as to whether any significant community spread has happened.

"That is disturbing news and now is the time for Sri Lankans to take this more seriously at home, and not see it as a Tourist problem. The myth that Sri Lanka is at less risk because it is a Tropical Country is exactly that, a myth, and any opinion to the contrary must be ignored.The first Myth Buster from the WHO is as follows :From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose."

"Due to the large numbers of tourists from Europe, hopefully these cases are either Tourists or directly linked to contact with Foreign Travelers, as this is now the trend:-10-March-2020 1 case12-March-2020 2 cases13-March-2020 3 cases16-March-2020 18 cases17-March-2020 28 cases18-March-2020 44 cases19-March-2020 60 casesIf this has reached the point of Community Spread, and based what has happened in countries with much greater access to Health Services and hygiene supplies, this has to be a concern. As there is no respite in case numbers across Europe I would fully expect the Airport Closure to be extended. Sri Lanka has no where near the resources of Singapore, let alone Germany or France, so may to looking more to Italy, Spain and Iran as indicators."

"This is encouraging news for Sri Lanka as there appears to be some slowing, possibly helped by the exodus of Tourists and the banning of those looking to come, not that anyone will with the situations at home.As numbers continue to escalate out of control in Europe the US and Australia I can't see a change in restrictions on those nations, not that they can even get out of their countries now.Ironically the nation most likely to reenter Sri Lanka will be China, and if things improve much further in China you may even see local pressure to reopen that border to provide some minor relief for a stricken Tourism Industry."
"Thousands of Chinese workers who work on large construction projects like Colombo Port City has come back. Apparently, they are first quarantined in China and then in Colombo they live on a barge for 14 days untill it is made sure that they are virus free.Edited: 4:00 pm, March 21, 2020 "

"Again, more promising news that the curve is flattening for Sri Lanka, as where nations struggling to contain the virus are seeing increases of upwards of 25% on the previous day, because if Sri Lanka had have carried on that trajectory from when Sri Lanka rocketed to be 60 on the 19th, using the 25% model for next 4 days, the projected cases would be 146, so to be 92 shows Sri Lanka is ahead of the game, and achieving a daily rate of 10 cases is still a positive outcome."
"That are just projections, Eugene. Statistics does not always have the last word: https:/…00.html (date of article 13.3.2020). And yes, early reaction and strict measures to prevent spreading of the virus as much as possible will flatten the curve."
"Statistics, or more importantly Analytics and Predictive Analytics are used daily in measuring reactions to actions, and applying those measures to modify behavior and outcomes.South Korea and China are examples of where actions altered outcomes and the continued changes to actions saw an equal reaction to the point that China is reporting 0 new local cases.This can be seen in the US where they are only just introducing actions to try and arrest the spread of COVID-19 as they are continuing to see 25-30% daily increases, as you would expect, if you don't change what you are doing the result stays the same.Which brings us back to Sri Lanka, the virus was introduced, drastic actions have been taken for which there appears to be impact on the spread of the virus. Sri Lanka are continuing to restrict movement within the nation to limit transferal from region to region. Tomorrow is a new day to again measure the impact."
"SKY IS FALLING!!!meanwhile, last month: few hundred dead on Sri Lankan roads.20 suicides per day, 50 deadly strokes per day, 10 of influenza and pneumonia per day (maybe because of the quality of the air that people breath?)BUT NOOOOcorona corona corona!years before it was terrorist attackspeople are such sheep that it is incredible."
"Yes but I don't think it is a wise idea to continue that discussion here now. Opinions seems to vary quite a bit on it.As soon as borders start opening up on Lankan side and other sides the discussion 'what is wise travel within the legal boundaries' will no doubt appear again, let's see how it fares by then.Tnx,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"While suicides, strokes and road accidents are bad, most people will try avoid them on a daily basis. I'm guessing you're educated enough about each of them and been arranging your life around them.But wide spread road accidents and strokes don't close airports, schools and countries. Maybe you should figure out why and how? And imagine how life must have been in Wrocclaw 75 years ago? Ughh. Road accidents and heart attacks and rodents but people were only bothered about the war. Incredible!"
"#29 you might be entitled to your opinion(s) but you are not entitled to calling names. Your post surely is not travel related. Or I have missed something??As long as there are legal restrictions to travel, we should follow them. If in retrospective the situation as of today will be evaluated as ""storm in a tea cup"", well, at least the people of Sri Lanka are breathing a slightly better air right now."
"Erik, yes, discussion of that, and other topics will resume. With new knowledge, I am sure."
"I would call #29 as much travel related as #31. And both are not helpful in the current situation. Wait some time until borders open and then we can discuss further what is wise then, and what would have been the most wise in retrospective.< Erik>"
"Fair enough. For the sake of all us, I hope the situation will improve soon."

"#31, not sure about the war in Breslau 75 years ago, ask the Germans about that, but they are already dead anyway...Also, if you compare WAR with sars-cov-2, well....good luck guys anyway, with the economy especially :)"
"Not a very friendly person, eh?!"
"Yeah he/she managed to miss my sarcasm by a mile.There will surely be a lot more of this is in the future. Lockdowns and quarantines don't go down so well with certain personalities. Mood swings and frustrations will go beyond manageable levels.There were some interesting local publications here about the sudden economic/socio impact of all this on pedophiles, domestic assaults, drug peddlers etc  But I'm not going to ask Wroclaw about it, the way he advised me to ask the Germans : ) I'd just read about it."
"There might be one good in all that bad; the closure of road traffic must have an important impact on number of accidents, and since Sri Lanka is still at 0 for coronavirus, there will be lives saved in the process of curfew.Economy, speaking from the travel or tourism industry, will be impacted tremendously ... but it will recover eventually. In the next years we might develop the urge to travel closer to our home country, but travel we will.Edited: 4:12 am, March 25, 2020 "

"Considering Sri Lanka were 82 cases on the 23/03/2020, to be only 20 cases in 3 days puts Sri Lanka well ahead of many nations who would envy the situation here. With no new Tourists entering and most leaving, in 7 - 10 days the only new cases will be community transmission.The other consideration will be the Sri Lankans returning and what quarantine restrictions are placed on them, as they will be the greatest risk."
