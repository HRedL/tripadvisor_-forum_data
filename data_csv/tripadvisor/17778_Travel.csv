I want to take vacation in Da Nang. I am traveling from USA. I want to know to which big city in Vietnam i have to fly and then how i can get to Da Nang??
"Vietnam has been closed to all tourists since March 22 2020.There is no talk of re-opening any time soon, so you can't currently travel to Vietnam at all.When Vietnam reopens: Danang is an international airport. Either fly there or fly in to HAN or SGN and catch a domestic flight to DAD."
"Currently, Vietnam is not open to flights and international tourists entering Vietnam to avoid the Covid 19 epidemic, so you cannot come from the US to Da Nang.Hope to welcome you in Vietnam in general and Da Nang in particular on the nearest date."
"Two big cities in Vietnam are Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. You can take flight to these cities then connect flight to Danang. Danang also has international port too but not many flights as Hanoi and HCM, you can check if there is direct flight to DN ( no need to connect via Hanoi or HCM)"
Flying to VietNam from USA is generally cheaper if you fly to SaiGon. Then connect to Da Nang on in country flight. Until the restrictions are lifted there’s no chance to come to VietNam. Hope to see you after there’s a vaccine available.
"Da Nang has its good points, but there are other places that are equal or better. The time of year and weather should be taken into account."
