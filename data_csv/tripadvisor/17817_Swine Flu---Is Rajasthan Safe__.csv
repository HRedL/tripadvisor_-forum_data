"Hi Friends,We are a family of 5 which inludes our parents, both Senior citizens. We wanted to know how is the Swine flu problem in Rajasthan now?? Is it safe to travel or should we cancel our Trip. We would be traveling to Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaipur from 15th Feb. Requesting your timely advise..."
"I have the same query, as I am headed for Jodhpur and Jaisalmer on 15th with my family which includes a 5 year old.I think its not an epidemic yet, but heard many cases in Rajasthan.would be great if someone could suggest soon."
"More hype is created than reality, just try to be hygenic wash your hands frequently. SwineFlu is there in Hyderabad also."
"Swine Flu is certainly a matter to be worried about, 25 deaths have been reported in Jodhpur. One must be careful while traveling and should take extra care of hygiene."

"Thanks all, continuing with my trip, and will take precautions. As it happens swine flu has reached the area that I live in Mumbai as well, so matter of sanitation I guess."
