"Hello folks - the in-laws are traveling in Cyprus - currently in the north. They were trying to get back to the South on Monday, March 16, but instead are trying to get back asap so as not to get shut out from their airport (Larnaca) to try and fly home to the U.S. I've seen conflicting info on U.S. and U.K. government websites re travel restrictions that are about to be in place as of March 15, 2020, that may jeopardize their ability to get back to the south and fly home. Does anyone have any current on-the-ground info re: a) whether any crossings from north to south will be open on March 15, 2020; b) which crossings will be open (I know 3 or 4 were closed last week), and c) what special information or paperwork they may need to show to permit their travel back into the south so they can get on a flight back to the U.S. on March 17? Thanks for any info! LC"

"Thank you for that info! The in-laws are currently stuck at Ledra Palace still trying to get over, but are being told that Cyprus will not let them back into the south (per those links, they do not fit into any of the groups currently allowed entry). The clampdown came rather quickly as they had already moved up their date of departure so that they could try and get out of Cyprus on Monday, and were trying to get out of N. Cyprus on Sunday to make their flight from Lanarca. I will fwd those links to them so that at least they can see what will or will not be open if they remain stuck in N. Cyprus for awhile. Also, they cannot fly out of Ercan (N. Cyprus) due to Turkey not allowing them in. Thanks again for the info, and good luck to anyone similarly situated."
Sad to hear this. Hope they stay safe. They should not be there in first place.
I feel bad for your relatives but it is just another reason why you don’t fly in Cyprus and then cross over to stay in the illegally occupied north
