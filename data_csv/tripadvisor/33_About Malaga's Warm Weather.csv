"Last Sunday the bad news was that the coronavirus hit the north of Italy.Yesterday morning TVE1 interviewed a Spanish doctor from Madrid who is the one of the best experts in viruses in Spain. He said that while the coronavirus infects many people, the people whom it kills are usually older people who have had health problems. It never kills young people. He also said that this virus likes cold weather. He predicted that as the weather gets warmer, there will be fewer people who will be infected. This means that the probability of getting the coronavirus in Malaga is very small because we mostly have warmer weather than anywhere in Spain during winter. This is good news for those of us who live in the Costa del Sol."
"Well, Dr. Benny, the Chinese Doctor who died from it looked pretty young and healthy!"
"There have been a number of deaths from the coronavirus among doctors who are young and, as far as we know, otherwise healthy.Does this reframe who we thought was at risk?According to Dr Bharat Pankhania, an expert on communicable disease control at the University of Exeter Medical School, it is not surprising that some young, healthy people die after contracting the virus, noting the risk of infection and even death is not zero for any demographic.“All of us are at risk, and hence the superlative efforts at keeping containment in place, and keeping the virus from circulating as much as we can do,” he said.David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed. “This is a new disease in humans, so no-one has immunity– health workers, like everyone else, don’t have immunity,” he said."
"No Benny. Nobody concerned about catching and dying from the coronavirus should be reassured by this. If it dies down in hot weather it could still reappear when the summer is over and to say that it never kills young people is hokum. I know you mean well but if Trump says it's true then that's a no-brainer for me.Edited: 2:01 am, February 25, 2020 "
Safest place is at home in front of the telly or computer. With a mask on. Preferably no physical contacts with anybody. Whatever age you are. No matter what the weather is like outside. Certainly do not visit countries like Iran. And most importantly listen to the advice of experts.
"All those visitors arriving from all over Europe in sealed aluminium tubes with recirculated air for two or three hours, then having a good old mingle at the luggage carousels before getting on the train or metro…"
Some use taxis a lot. This can be a bad move also. You never know who was in that vehicle before yourself. Suggest use medical disinfectant swabs to wipe down door handles and seats.
And if a community with just one having the Covid-19 attends a church such as happened in South Korea then it spreads to others. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus was apparently the source of the continuing infections. Worrying cult.
"Tenerife is a warm place at this time of the year and unfortunately guests stating in one hotel H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel are not enjoying a break. A guest from Italy, a doctor, was potentially found to have the Covid-19.."
"Dr. Nancy Messionnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounds a similar note when it comes to predicting a slowdown of cases with warmer weather. ""I think it's premature to assume that,"" she said during a call with reporters on Wednesday. ""We haven't been through even a single year with this pathogen.""Given the uncertainty, public health officials say they must plan for the unexpected and for the possibility that the outbreak drags on regardless of the weather."
Maybe it came in on the calima to Tenerife…

Dr Benny - are you still confident that Malaga is the safest place to be in the world?
https:/…
"From El Pais English edition"" A 62-year-old man who has been in a Seville hospital for pneumonia since February 20 has been confirmed as the first case of Covid-19 contagion registered in Spain. The diagnosis is highly significant given that it confirms the suspicions of many specialists after the spike in coronavirus cases in Italy: “The virus has been circulating for several days in Spain and we hadn’t detected it,” said the head of infectious diseases at a major Spanish hospital earlier this week."""
That's one of the most novel ideas yet for promoting Malaga though
"Most flu viruses are caught by either droplet transmission or touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face (eyes, nose mouth).Not a lot you can do about droplet transmission as most face masks offer little protection.Touching a contaminated surface (which can have live virus for at least 48 hours) can be mitigated by wearing gloves as you are less likely to touch your face when wearing gloves. Washing hands and using alcohol based sanitizer at frequent intervals is also recommended.Avoid using cash - use a contactless card."
"Benny. Not wishing to be contrary, but if I was Spanish I'd also promote the theory of hot weather killing the virus. So conversely, would you be more vulnerable in Scandinavia or Iceland in the cold weather. Not aware of the virus reaching those cooler climates as yet. Are you sure the doctor was not put up by the Spanish Tourist Board."
"Good point Michael G - go on, be contrary, take our minds off the endless wind and rain!Edited: 1:35 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Planning to go in two weeks but I am not sure whether to travel to Europe or not , obviously you can get it anywhere and of course in Northern Ireland where we live but more travellers go to costa del sol. It’s a dilemma! We’ll be watching reports carefully over the next two weeks. Don’t know if anyone else in same frame of mind as me ?"
But will it be warm enough?
"Unless you’re in a vulnerable group (immuno-suppressed; people over 65 with other illnesses; people over 75) I can’t see any realistic reason for not going. Do make sure you have decent travel insurance though, as Schengen was an early casualty of the virus don’t rely on EHIC."
"I flew back to London from Valencia on Thursday, I’m going to France in March, CDS in May and Germany in June. Until the FCO advises not to go, then I will be having my holidays as normal.The number of mortalities are extremely low compared to winter flu statistics. Also, there is a lot of media hype."
"Patti39, you are already in Europe when in Belfast..."
"I’m in the other camp. We fly SEA-JFK-MAD in 10 days. I’m holding my breath that they doesn’t restrict our travel before then... There’d be hell to pay! LOLOn the other hand, I’d relish the idea of calling work on the other end of the trip, saying “sorry, we’re not able to come home!” (And before someone jumps on me, cool your jets, I’m not really wishing for a pandemic)."
"The trouble is that nobody knows how the virus will transpire, not even the people ""in the know"" know. It could just gradually fizzle out or end up huge.An airport is possibly the most vulnerable place to be but unless flights are affected I will carry on with my travel plans whilst taking what precautions I can by using plenty of alcohol based hand cleansing solution plus also taking double of any required medications should my return journey be delayed."
"Oh yes I know we are in Europe lol , I meant the continent. We’re not in the vulnerable group and not really worried about actually getting the virus so much but wouldn’t want to be quarantined for two weeks in our hotel room and then maybe another two weeks at home, just want my holiday and then get home. Obviously it would be pretty bad luck if someone in our hotel were to contract the virus like the hotel in Tenerife but it is possible. Just going to hope for the best that in the next two weeks Malaga isn’t on the list for an outbreak."
"Hi Patti39, I'm going on Thursday..."
Hope you have great time & get back safe - prob better going sooner rather than later!
"this is about ""malaga's warm weather""?"
"It was 75° here in Fuengirola yesterday so, if Benny is correct, that should stop it in its tracks!"
winchmoren You can breathe easily. The Doctor has ordained
"The virus first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The average temperature is 2-11C during December.On March 11, TV news interviewed Isabel Sola, who is the Codirector of the Centro Nacional de Biotechnologia de Madrid (CNB-CSIC). She is an expert on the disease. She said that with the warming of the temperature in spring and the advent of more sun, the virus will be less deadly because the virus prefers cold weather."
"Unfortunately other experts are of the view that warmer weather will not, in itself, make a significant difference. However, warmer weather will reduce the incidence of other infections, thus freeing up hospital space for victims of CV."
"Covid-19 is not your average influenza. I will quote a senior expert in England:"" the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 are much greater than the flu. And it isn’t clear if COVID-19 transmission will be affected by seasonal temperature variation.""See full article heretheconversation.com/will-warmer-weather-stop…I wish some people on these Forums would refrain from passing on fake news."
"""I wish some people on these Forums would refrain from passing on fake news.""Benny, I think that is directed at you."
Howard LMany of us know how ‘useful’ so many of Bennys posts are.

Now Benny has a new cut and paste on ForumsQuoteAs of today there have been 3000 people infected in Spain with the coronavirus and there have been 84 deaths.I would postpone my trip until the crisis ends in several months.UnquoteBut why not any retraction or even that cut and paste on this thread ? Ans. Never return to same thread for correction.
"A friend in the US sent me this:Tips from the Stanford Hospital (Palo Alto, California, USA)The Stanford Hospital is one of the leading hospitals in the US. They have these tips about the coronavirus:1. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. Please send and share this with family and friends. 2. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 110. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water! THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days. 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention."
"The advice about hot drinks is completely wrong, as is the information about the temperature."
It is getting ridiculous. Trust Benny or the WHO ?https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177262/…
This is appalling misinformation. How can this thread be removed?

There has just been an article on BBC2 about the Fake News on FB about coronavirus. Exactly like this one. They are incorrect and can be detrimental to people’s health.
Benny is prone to be above any advice from others participating in these Forums. I think he needs new friends in US if he goes along with the fake news post message he receives.This is from Stanfordhttps:/…novel-coronavirus.html
