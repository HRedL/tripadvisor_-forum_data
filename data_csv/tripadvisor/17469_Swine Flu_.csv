"Its bound to hit this forum regarding the news about the swine flu. We are heading down to Bucerias this Thursday and with the news here in Canada and in the US getting worse by the minute, we are having second thoughts about coming down. Should we wait a month or two until the news gets better, we don't know. What I want to ask is what are those who live in Bucerias hearing about the flu in your area. Is it over blown up here, or is it worse down there. Please give us your point of view.Thank you and take care!"
"Not posting from Bucerias - but from what I have seen and read on the news the focal point is The Yucatan Penninsula, Mexico City, Texas, and California - so you should be fine in Bucerias.But who knows with travellers aboard planes etc. etc. coming home from these places.It is very scarey to say the least."
"It was just on the national news update on the swine flu. Puerto Vallarta and Aculpoco were just added to the list of outbreaks. I sure hope this gets under control because I am heading there the first week of August. Hopefully, all will be fine by then. "
I would be extremely uncomfortable going to anywhere that there are people in my age group dieing from a virus.I am actually concerned just because I was in Mexico in March.I wouldn't want to go abroad when there is a chance of getting sick (think medicare in other countries) never mind going to a country where the virus is quickly spreading.Just my thoughts!
Three of us will be there on May 4th. We will be staying at the Playa Del Sol Grand for 15 days. I ordered some med's to take with me just in case I start feeling ill. I would like to know about the area there concerning swine flu also. Deloss & Kimberly
I have not heard of cases in Puerto Vallarta or Acapulco. There is a very confusing map going around the internet that shows the states of Mexico with suspected cases and it has Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco marked on it BUT the states containing these two resorts are marked as NOT yet having any suspect cases! I think these two places are just marked on the map for reference.If anyway has any solid information on cases in Acapulco please post the link as I have family there - thank you.
"Dear CanMike,I live in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico and so far so good!As of the evening of April 27, the Associated Press reported ""...the State of Jalisco, in which Puerto Vallarta is located, have no confirmed cases...""I recommend monitoring reliable news sources like the Associated Press (www.ap.org), the US Centers for Disease Control (www.CDC.gov) and the World Health Organization (www.who.int) As always, watch-out for inaccurate emotional information.As you probably know in major cities, especially Mexico City, The Mexican government is treating this as an very important matter and closing public locations (museums, churches, etc.) In PV I have heard confirmation of closing nightclubs and I think perhaps restaurants too. I have friends who own bars, nightclubs and restaurants, but I haven't been out today (Monday, 27 Apr 09) to talk with them to get full detail. I also haven't heard of any hotel closures or the like. If I hear confirmed news, I'll be happy to post.On April 26, I spoke with my mother in the State of Kansas in the USA and they have two confirmed cases, but have not taken any unusual action.I have been searching for the method of transmission and so far only found info on the common strains of flu which tends to be getting it on your hands and then introducing it to yourself by touching your eyes, nose or mouth. So..the old advice of frequent hand washing and not touching your face is probably the best bet.However, like anyone, monitor good sources to make an informed decision. It is ultimately based on your personal comfort level. I am planning on staying put and am not worried.--Jeffery in PV"
I love Mexico and I hope this horrible problem ends soon.The biggest fear I would have about booking a trip to Mexico right now is your airline cancelling your flight? What about quarantine when you get back?Now I hear that other countries are banning travel to Canada and USA as we have cases as well. Mexico is not alone in their ban now!Scarey stuff!
Hey senorita...we'll be at PDSG on may 2-9th too!! What did you order for meds??? You think I should contact my doc???
"Here is the notice from the CDC:…cdc.gov/travel/contentSwineFluMexico.aspxThey are not recommending that you stop travel, but honestly, do you want to take a chance? If your health or immune system is in any way compromised they recommend taking antiviral medications before you go. Several airlines are offering flight changes for a later date if you have plans to fly....but in the face of a major illness (and being stuck on a plane with recirculating air for hours) I would have to say I would really take this seriously. This is your life you're talking about here, and the projections say it is only going to get worse before it gets better.The report I heard today said that (for several possible reasons) the effects on those in Mexico have been more severe than those reported in the U.S. I'm not telling to do one thing or the other, but I am a scientist in a previous life, so this is of great interest to me. Just presenting the facts. Whether or not Jalisco has reported cases NOW or not is irrelevant. It only takes hours to spread."
"The bottom line really is that anything can happen anywhere. I live in Toronto - we had SARS....we couldn't leave, that's where we live. This past summer we had cold cuts that were killing people. We had water in an area not too far from us a few years back that killed people. USA had spinach and tomatoes, peanuts and other veggies in the last few years that people got sick from (maybe died? not sure). Anywhere anytime something can happen to you whether you are at home or away.Don't panic. Take a deep breath and be a bit more cautious. I just came back from two separate trips in March from Mexico, I leave in 3 weeks time for Guadalajra and PV, then 4 weeks after I return from that trip I am heading out to Playa Del Carmen. So I'm going to pack some extra hand sanitizer, take some masks for the plane and airport (your more likely to catch something on the plane with the nice ""clean"" air that you are breathing) on the plane I will make sure that my air vent is closed I'll have a drink and relax. You could get hit by a bus instead. Just joking but trying to get the point across that really anything can happen anywhere at any time if you are at home or travelling. Just be a bit more dilligent about washing hands etc.My two cents for what it's worth."
"Oooops, sorry, I didn't see someone had posted the CDC website.Forgot to mention, I hope all in Mexico take care and stay healthy!Tammy"
Just found this:…yahoo.com/s/…med_swine_flu
"Tamiflu or Relenza is the only two med's working for this flu. Take within two days of symptoms. I am bringing Tamiflu. I did not have to see a Dr. I just called my Dr. and told her that I was going to Mexico and asked if I could get a prescription and she called it into a pharmacy for me. I think that I am only going to take it if I get a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, coughing, and dizzy are the symptoms to watch for. I think if I was to take it without the symptoms that my body will build a resistance to the drug and then if I ever NEEDED it, there would be a tolerance built up and I would be screwed. I know that before I had medical insurance I didn't have much money to see a Dr. And the cheap dr's were not very good. These people that died in Mexico probably didn't see a Dr. and if they did, saw a cheap Dr. that didn't know what to give them. Or went to late. I read that one person with symptoms was sent away saying that they were to busy at one of the hospitals. Another thing I remember reading, don't quote me word for word, was something like; sometime near the start of all of this, they (Dr) didn't send 4 samples in for 4 days making it too late to do anything. This has been going on for almost a month and a half. We are just now hearing of this flu within the last few days. We are taking the med's with us, with the knowledge of how to protect ourselves. We may change our minds on going, but I doubt it. I will read and ask questions, wait and watch. I will not hesitate to back out of going if I see/hear something too alarming pertaining to us. I have a LOT to live for. But at the same time, how does that saying go: If you worry about yesterday and you worry about tomorrow, you will p_ all over today. "
"The news is saying to take one of the two drugs within 24 hours of symptoms. Boy, the numbers are climbing. All three of us are still in though! The T.V. won't shut up about it. People here are too freaked. They are either saying ""you can die in your own cup of tea"" or there angry and saying the borders should be shut down. I don't think I will be broadcasting that we are going to anyone I don't have to here in person. If there was evidence that these two drugs didn't stop the progression of the flu, then I would be concerned maybe. But by what I heard Tamiflu and Relenza works immediately and effectively for one year olds on up. I would like to know if anyone has taken one of these two drugs within 24 of symptoms and it progressed. "
"If you check the Mexico forum, it has recently been posted that most flights from the UK to Mexico have been rerouted to another location or cancelled...some until May 5th. Thought this might be interesting for those from that area.Tammy"
"I am not hearing from anyone that lives there. ??? Update, PLEASE."
Here is a link showing where you can get recent updates. Hope this helps.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g150793-i46-k27463…
"I hope it is OK to post that information from Pamela Thompson, Puerto VallartaHealthcare Resources, can be found on BanderasNews.com."
"Here is the most recent update from Health Canada in regards to the Swine Flu in Mexico:The Government of Mexico has reported an outbreak of human swine influenza throughout Mexico. This strain of swine influenza virus has never been identified in humans before. The number of reported cases, as well as deaths, has risen steadily throughout the month of April and is now affecting most regions of Mexico.As of April 27 2009, travellers from Canada are recommended to postpone elective or non-essential travel to Mexico until further notice.I hope everyone bought cancellation insurance! "
"Health Canada also advises not to step in front of a moving bus.And not to travel to Mexico because of drug wars.And not to travel because the economy is horrible and we're entering a Depression.And now not to travel because of swine flu.A little common sense, proper precautions, and a hit of Valium will hopefully allow people to relax and enjoy their vacations!"
"I think the best thing to do would be to postpone your trip to another time or pick another destination.Right now I believe from Canada that choice is voluntary, but it might not be long before the choice is removed.I think more of the fear is on your return to Canada then actually being in Mexico itself. What if you are in quaratine and can't go home? What if the plane doesn't come to get you at all? Look how much has happened in just a few days, imagine what can happen in a week!Poor Mexico, my very favourite place. Really I hope things get better very soon!"
"I don't usually get too concerned about travelers alerts and yes there are issues everywhere that could cause illness...but I think I might give this some extra consideration if I were booked for Mexico right now. I've worked in the medical field for over 30 yrs and have had to deal with outbreaks of all descriptions. It's easily said to make sure you 'wash your hands""...and yes that most definitely is the key to containing most types of outbreak...but not everyone is all that compliant...and it's human nature to forget. Even if one doesn't catch anything while in Mexico...the plane you fly in may be a different matter. Aside from all this I think that ""Rodeo"" has a very good point. You may have issues getting back home if things continue to escalate in Mexico. I found this link on another forum. Airlines etc are postponing their flights/vacations, so folks might want to make sure that if they decide to go...they can get home.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/04/28/transat.html"
air transat is not taking anyone to mexico but will bring home the ones that are there.
"I got my perscrition on Saturday for Tamiflu. My husband was able to get his filled on Monday. My mother on the other hand has talked to two different Drs and they both said no that they will not give her a scipt. ??? If you do get a script, keep it untill it expires. There has been flu that broke out in the spring and then it died down for the summer and then it came back full forse in the fall. Take either Tamiflu or Relenza within 24 hours of symptoms."
"I am booked for May 9. I would still go...it's not the flu that has me worried, I am more concerned that if I go it will end up being like a ghost town. Restaurants and stores may be closed...it's already quiet time, it may be even more quiet (not that quiet is bad, but ""deserted"" isn't much fun either). When people return over the next couple of days, it would be nice if you could post some updates on what Bucerias is like these days. Thanks. "
"I know, if that mega/walmart/grocery/restaurants closes I would need to know prior to going. I am hoping trip insurance covers a place to stay while there if the airport closes down, not to mention food, etc. I sent a personal message to the Bucerias expert Mersol and I will post any replies I get. I asked about business/restaurants/mega etc. And if they have heard of any cases of the flu there. Hopefully we will get a reply. I would really like to hear from people that has came back from there also."
"I have been following the Banderas Bay News. Hopefully, it will keep us updated on what is going on there. I am going down in August, so hope all is in control by then. http://banderasnews.com/"
"My husband called the number for info on our airlines at ""Access America"" concerning trip insurance. It took a long time to get a live person on the phone to ask questions pertaining to coverage. They do not cover ""epidemics"" and they are considering the swine flu as an epidemic. So no, it wouldn't protect me to purchase trip insurance. So, if we were to get down there and the airline did not bring me back (shut down the border sort of say), I would be on my own to cover shelter/food until the border reopened. "
Mersol returned my message. She/He left there last Wednesday. SO no answers there. I know that the only other Bucerias expert is also planning on leaving soon too by what she writes.
FYIWHO has moved the Swine flu (North American swine flu) level to 5.More on:http://www.who.int/en/
"As part of WHO's full update, is the quote ""WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders.""Thank goodness we're soon to be flying Alaska Airlines & not WestJet or Air Canada."
"Re: Posters saying it's fine to travel because WHO has not called for travel restrictions.WHO doesn't call for restrictions because it doesn't do any good at this point. Check with your own country's health authority/ministry. US & Canada have discouraged non-essential travel.For those of you thinking this is no big deal: this pandemic went from nothing to WHO stage 5 in less than a week. You have no idea how prevalent it is going to be, or what the fatality rate is going to be. The only certainty is that by traveling you are raising the potential for either catching this and spreading it.TV is running a scare show, it's true. But the WHO and the CDC are not. As they say, this is not a drill."
"Alaska Airlines uses ""Access America"" as their flight insurance co and it does not cover epidemics, and that is what they are saying this is. Call them with your questions. That is what they told us. No one else is scratching their head at the amount they are telling us of confirmed deaths from this swine flu in Mexico (yesterdays numbers, I haven't heard today's yet) is only 7? I have had 3 postings removed from this forum. I imagine this one will be pulled also. "
"Go the link below for web links for CDC, WHO...tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g150793-i46-k27510…"
"ok, so there's like 2 thousand something cases in mexico...oh no...more like SUSPECTED cases...they aren't even confirmed!!!! How about give me some confirmed numbers!! Whatever, I'm still flying out saturday, gonna have an awesome time and not going to worry about it. The ""regular"" flu is just as deathly as this but no one makes a big deal. "
"Wow, a really hot but important topic.We were to leave for Calgary today and fly out to PV, tomorrow morning. Having 5 kids at home while my wife and I head down to Bucerias for a few days wasn't worth the risk. I heard a lot of pros and cons, but we decided to play it safe. US Airlines has given us 1 year to use our tickets, so we are going to re-schedule for next November. On a positive note, we are going to save up money until we leave and bring our kids with us and even stay longer than we planned on this trip. Its disappointing not to be in paradise, but we'll get there soon enough. To all our Bucerias friends, take care and be safe.Canadian Mike"
"we are scheduled to arrive in nuevo vallarta on the 8th of may. staying at the grand mayan. how are things looking as of today as far as safety, bars and restaurants being open?"
"Another thing to keep in mind. I would guess that many areas are going to be like ghost towns and staff will be low as well.Why travel knowing that even if you don't get sick, what level of service are you going to have? I would assume gathering places are closed (bars, discos, closed in restuarants, etc).Buses? Taxis? Boats?What if you do get sick? Do you understand the language enough to get help?"
Does anyone know if the Mega and other grocers are closing? 
"Hi, I'm the ""other"" DE for Bucerias. Came down with food poisoning last Sat. and the only places I have gone until today are the clinic for my blood work and daily antibiotic shots, the drugstore and the little corner grocery.Went to Mega a few hours ago. They are open, probably because they are considered an ""essential"" service. There were not many shoppers there. Most employees wear masks and some things are different. The prepared foods like guacamole and salsa fresca can no longer be scooped into plastic containers by customers, a clerk does it for you.In Mega, I ran into Karen Blair, the owner of Karen's Place at the Costa Dorada on the beach. She said that she heard that restaurants MAY be closing soon, but she didn't know when or if restaurants would be closing.That's about all I know. Since I have to go to the clinic for more blood work in a week, I'll probably be staying here until my planned departure date of May 16."
I just saw a post on the Bucerias forum that all restaurants in Bucerias have been closed for at least 5 days.
"I live in Bucerias and at this time there are NO CASES OF THE FLU in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, or Colima (the three states in the area.) If you are wondering about what is going on you can go to the website: banderasnews.com and there is a DAILY update of what is happening in this area. I do see some masks being worn mostly by food handlers and delivery people but the majority of the people around here ARE NOT overly concerned about it at this time. The new is totally blow out of proportion up there! Yes, there have been 7 people die from this flu BUT keep in mind that 36,000 people die in the US each year from the flu. There are 105 MILLION people in Mexico and 20 MILLION live in Mexico city. When you take those numbers into consideration.....you do the math. I personally am NOT worried about this flu around here in the bay. It isn't here yet and who know when/if it ever will get here. Have a great time here and don't worry about the flu...be careful of course. that is just common sense!"
do you know if Mega accepts U.S. debt card? Do they give us cash (pasos) over our amount of purchase like walmart here? 
"If you have a debit card, just get pesos at an ATM. There are 4 of them next to the pharmacy in Mega and there are 2 outside in the strip mall next to the store. Scotiabank and Banamex. (I always use my VISA credit card when I shop at Mega.)"
"Thank you Elenamax, you've be big help."
"What is maddening is there reporting deaths before they investigate, only to find out some of these people did not die from the Swine flu. We went through the scare of SARS & then the Bird flu--& nothing happened. I completely understand the worry about traveling to Mexico--but it looks like the U.S has got some cases of it too. In fact it looks like it is traveling everywhere.The good news--When the virus went from human to human--our own immune systems are handeling it--& are not dying from it.However, if you health is compromised by other diseases--you know or you know you don't have a good immune system it's time to stay home & protect yourself--until this passes."
"You can bet the Mega will be open. People have to eat no matter what. I think this panic has gotten a little out of hand. ""Supposedly"" the swine flu orginated in Mexico City. I live in Colorado & all year long--we have seen the exact same symptoms that they are talking about with the swine flu. One of our younger healthy kids in my family was hospitalized in November with pnemonia! The doctors called it a ""virus""! It was scary time for us. He recovered fine. All throughout my area people have been describing the exact same symtoms--soar throat, tight chest, cough & describe it as the ever lasting cold. All have recovered & are doing fine.Last week Mexico accused the United States of bringing this flu down to them. And after what I have seen in my home state during the flu season this year--they may have a point??The health of anyone living in Mexico City is already compromised, especially their respiratory systems. Living in Mexico city is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes daily because of the air polution. I think the panic is starting to settle down a little--but right now it really doesn't matter where you're at--as it is traveling around the world. "
Remember at their ATM machines--using an American debit card--that 150 pesos will be the equivalent of $15.00. So for $150.00 dollars you would push 1500 pesos.
