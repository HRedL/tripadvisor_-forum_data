"Interesting stats Ffm & by coincidence, this report was on the Sky News app this morning, discussing why Belgium is being affected so badly…sky.com/story/coronavirus-why-is-belgium-a-…"
"Ooops, posted the wrong link in aboveThe link should have beenhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-der…However, the other link I posted which I was looking at shows the havoc this virus is having and it brings the deaths even more into focus when you see them ranked by % of population"
"There are different reasons why the death toll is so high in Belgium- the way coronavirus deaths are counted, in Belgium suspected untested deaths are counted (some of them may be removed from the total after inquiry)- It is a small country and the whole country is affected. In France or Italy some regions have much fewer cases- the disaster in the care homes. We reach the point with as many deaths in the care homes as in the hospitals. Here also, there are several explanations. The lack of masks, gloves,. ... But I also remember that 4 weeks ago, the authorities, but also the health experts and the medical sector were always talking about the hospitals, the hospitals, the hospitals and almost nothing about the care homes. Now it is the opposite.- More controversial, the weakness of our minority government. The health minister in particular, Maggie De Block, has reached a popularity rate of about 0 %."
"When I first looked at statistics comparing rates in different countries, I assumed that it was because some places had better ways of managing the virus. This might not be true. Some countries are testing more people, so they will probably have larger percentages of cases. Some countries only count hospital deaths, which would lead to lower different death rates. Some countries have older populations.So... comparing apples to oranges. I was hoping that statistics would show us what we should do to improve and prevent such large loss of life."
#4 The obvious conclusion is that you must focus much more on the care / nursery homes and find new solutions for them.
"Very much agree that unless we have more data on the deaths we will never get a true pictureFor instance the figure for the UK is for deaths that have occurred in hospitals only and does not included those for care homes, etc"
"Interesting what Pierre says about how badly care homes have been affected by the virus.The UK government is being heavily criticised for giving priority to the health service and forgetting the care homes and there have been many deaths.In the early stages I heard the virus as like a bad flu or pneumonia so it seemed obvious to me that care homes would be badly hit , the same as in a hard winter with fluSo perhaps our government is the same as Belgium but can anyone tell me how Germany have managed to avoid high number of deaths"
I think that Germany have (& had before this crisis started) more icu beds per head of population than most other countries
And they spend 50% more than we do on their health service. Time to pony up folks!
Plus here in UK I believe we are still allowing planes to fly in from some of the worse affected countries. Many countries in the EU have banned flights from affected countries.
It isn't at night we seem to have more raccoons making a racket as they seem to be taking over.
