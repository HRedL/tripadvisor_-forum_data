"Thanks for that share. Some little mistakes but pretty accurate for today.Mike, I expect we will be buying beer from the police officer on the bus, LOL.Edited: 11:49 am, July 02, 2020 "
How are they going to test every tourist to know if they have the virus on the spot.
Isolate tourists from population... will there at least be gardeners to play with? :)
"Hola gat0Well......it certainly isn't official, cannot provide a link from a newspaper or any other source, but I have heard that the ""talk"" is that while the testing would take place at the airport on arrival, the results will likely take 3 days. If that is the case, let's think about that one..... what does it mean if you test positive - or some other person(s) on your flight tested positive and you find this out 3 or 4 days into your 7 day vacation?? Firstly, the obvious question about potential spread to who knows how many people working or vacationing at the resort. Likely to be a lot more additional mandatory testing taking place from that point. Then the question of being quarantined - and who is going to be quarantined - the infected person and those within a 6 row seating range? Where will the quarantine take place??? Think you'll make it back onto that plane for your return flight home?? Better take lots of extra money with you - your insurance won't likely pay for your extended quarantine/vacation....Still too many unknowns for my comfort zone. But that is only one man's opinion.Cheers"
I find the tone of the article a bit negative.And I want to know where are the ferries that they mention.Someone mentioned that Jamaica tried testing on arrival and then changed it to requiring tests before travel.
"Well I think the testing they are talking about is just temperature monitoring of all passengers , just like they did with SARS , and if someone has a fever then they do there nose swab . But , yes , then what happens if one or several people have a fever and have to wait days for results Seems alittle Wishy Washy .Just my thoughts . Johnny CEdited: 2:01 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"Hola Johhny CTemperature monitoring is one thing for sure, however, with a significant number of people that appear to be asymptomatic positive cases, I wonder if the nose swab will be more of the norm? Do you think there is a limited number of test kits available? How long before the price of the test is included in your ticket along with your tourist card???Cheers"
"The authorities said they would do a ""PCR in tiempo real"" to all tourists coming in. They take a small drop of blood from your fingers and it gives you results in a few minutes. Anyone who tests positive then have to be tested again, with a swap in the throat and the results take 3 days."
"Jeeezuz , Blood Tests now . This is getting more and more uninviting . Bloody hell man . Johnny C"
A simple prick test is nothing. It is somthing a diabetic does every day.
"Each bus will have police on it to enforce the rules. Sounds like even if we know we are supposed go directly to the resort, we are going to take over and force the driver to take us somewhere else."
When we first started to go to Cuba hotels we had police escorts to and from. I can not see a problem with this.
I read that it will take a few extra hours at the Cuban airport to get the results of the test. ?? That would be the proper way if the tests are 99.9% true. It actually should be that way before departure.
Diva...you should know my humour by now...lol
"@14) yes, they should really do it at our end...are they?"
The Minister of tourism said that police would escort the buses that go from Santa Clara to CSM. It said specifically that they would not do that for CC and CL. And never said anything about a police officer in the bus.Don't believe anything coming from Miami's propaganda...
Gengen my daughter in lsw is a nurse at an Emergency in Montreal and i asked her about a drop of blood done on people .Her answer was she never heard of such a thing at the hospital .She said nothing will show up with a blood test .Only when way to find out and its to test you by the nose like we have seen .
"Gato, sorry she does not know about it. But those tests come from China and Cuba has been using them since April I think. They are showing it to us on tv all the time and my in-laws receive it too. The results show up in 5-15 minutes. www.escambray.cu/tag/pcr-en-tiempo-real/"
"When they first opened up Cayo Santa Maria the bus always had a police escort. Made much better time that way! The cops pushed everyone out of the way of the bus. If they revert to that practice you will get to your resort quicker, so that's one plus for those who dislike the long trip.And yes, China has a blood test for Covid.....Edited: 4:52 pm, July 02, 2020 "
Gengen thanks for the information i will tell her about it .
"Hola @20 - ""And yes, China has a blood test for Covid.....""Might be one explanation why a country with a population of +/-1,439,323,776 and over 90,400,000 tests has fewer recorded cases than Canada and about half the number of deaths..... of course use of masks could be another reason??? I would like to know if these blood tests are so fast and simple, why are they not being used in Canada for testing???? Guesses anyone??Cheers"
the 2 mikes??
rrrichar the numbers the Chinese are posting about Covid 19 are a total joke .It all started in China and its like everything is back to normal all under control ye right .
"@22, there are some questions about the accuracy of those tests. I have seen estimates as low as 50% accuracy, but who knows? As with many things that get political, it depends on who you ask. As far as the Chinese having better numbers, they did get on to this quickly and essentially locked down the whole country, and have been diligent in testing and contact tracing, which seems to be the road to success in other countries that have fared well. The States, OTOH, is a textbook example of how to do it wrong!"
"Gato , it seems that very few people have heard about it in Canada. But Cuban made a lot of publicity when they received it, so most people here have an idea of what they are. On the other hand, I'm sure that many types of technics and treatments were discussed in Canada and we never heard of them in Cuba. When I go back, I will probably be clueless about many things Covid related...I know that you can get a false positive to the test, because Cuba will give you the other test (the swab) after you test positive to the PCR. And in some cases, the person ends up testing negative. I don't know if à false negative is possible."
"Hola eeeefarm @25""The States, OTOH, is a textbook example of how to do it wrong!""Would be pretty hard to disagree with that statement!Not so often when you are in first place, but is really the last place you want to be....Cheers"
"""Not so often when you are in first place, but is really the last place you want to be....""Well, they are number one. Maybe not what the MAGA folks were expecting them to be best at, however."

Btw - the title of this thread is only right if you regard the whole of Cayo Coco as a “tourist holiday compound”.
"As my link indicates, blood tests have been used since May in Canada. They expect to use this test for several years to come."
"The only blood test for Covid is for Antibodies, the Chinese tests did not work when tested by various countries around the world, there is an antibody test that works but it needs a vial of blood rather than a drop"
The covid test is a swab in both nose and throat and a test that uses blood is a serology test that shows you have had it
"There is work being done on a rapid diagnostic test based on protein detection which would work with saliva or blood, but I don't think they are there yet. The expected time frame would be 10 minutes for diagnosis.https://www.biospectrumasia.com/news/91/1596…Edited: 7:42 am, July 03, 2020 "
They are testing a saliva one at the momment. It would be more bareable than the covid test now
"I sure hope a vaccine is found soon and this virus is brought under control, maybe a rapid un invasive test will be found and people can choose to vacation with this in mind! One of the main reasons we love vacationing in Cuba is the safety and freedom to travel off the resort, armed guards at resort entrances has never appealed to me, I think the concern of catching a virus out of country no matter how effective the testing procedures are will keep me home for a while yet!Edited: 9:27 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Hola @38I hear you, my Cuban friends say stay home for this year, and wait for a vaccine, or at least when it stops spreading, hopefully. I go off resort each visit, take a taxi each time to and from the hotels, being locked up at a hotel for 7 or 14 days...just is not going to work for me also. Even the plane flight now is non starter for me. The risk, and type of vacation now is not appealing at all.Nothing good about 2020cheers."
"@39, I agree with everything you said....doesn't appeal to me at all, not going anywhere."
"Phase 3 in Cuba will happen far sooner than everyone thinks. Think positive people. The negativity on this forum now is absolutely suffocating. Have some faith in the science, and our 2 government's adhering to that. A vaccine will not be entirely necessary to achieve a reopening of Cuba or Canada. That's just a fact. Extra hoops to jump through... sure. But think on the bright side... it's going to happen. Does anyone really believe that both Canada and Cuba would allow all of the progress made to be squandered by not taking all of the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe?? We have the science... we have the technology. And we have the ability to screen out all those who would be a threat to success. Terry"
"I have been saying for months phase 3 will be 1st September. Today I think it will be before.I do not understand why so many canadians are saying they will not travel. Canadians, on mass, rarely travel in july/august anyway."
Diva many Canadians do travel in July and August when they have younger kids which was my case when my kids were younger .July and August are not as popular as the winter months for sure but the summer months school is over and these are the only months they can travel as a family and of course prices are also higher to travel South .July and August are the 2 most popular months that people will take a vacation many companies will even shut down for 2 weeks here in the Province of Quebec .
To Cuba?Which after all this is a Cuba forum.
"For many living in Montreal and Toronto, the summer choices are to take a chance on an expensive rainy week at a lake rental cottage, or a guaranteed hot/sunny trip to Cuba.For other Canadians like us, summer is beautiful here and we wouldn't travel south for all the tea in China."
Yes to Cuba .
"I need to get back , I’m running outta cigars .Johnny C"
"I can't visit my daughters in Nova Scotia presently and from what they are saying they expect out of province licence plates to be frowned on when things open up a bit, maybe they just don't want to see their grumpy old Dad! Everyone has different reasons to travel to Cuba and different thresholds of risks to take, if I was Terry I would definitely want to be travelling to Cuba as soon as it is allowed! I live on a boat most of the summer and last night was my first overnight stay, things are quite different here now with all of the limitations and this is just an hour from my home!Edited: 11:56 am, July 03, 2020 "
"gator, it's OK. We're dealing with it, Judi and I. It is what it is. Even I'm not targeting being back to Cuba until much later in November when for the first time in almost 2 years, there's actually a flight now scheduled with Sunwing that will fly ""direct"" from Toronto to the city of Camagüey again. We can hold out for that, and in the meantime, we're just renovating our casa, and recently put in the new 2 tonne A/C and new refrigerator. Next is finishing the bano... we have everything needed short of the new marble ceramic tiles and bags of cement, but apparently the ceramic tiles are now making a new comeback on the market in Cam... bags of cement, not so much.Glad you made it out to your boat again. Nice way to stay cooler during this Cuba calor we're all experiencing here now in Ontario. Sweet!Terry"
"I think it is logical that phase 3 could happen sooner than a lot of people think, given Cuba's success so far with dealing with the virus. But It may well be the rules of the countries of origin, as well as people's own personal feelings that determine how many will visit Cuba.Cuba may want, and even desperately need tourists, but it seems they are taking more measures to limit the spread of the virus than what some countries are doing."
"I for one hope you folks are right (sooner than later), WJet have flights showing in Aug, which they haven't canceled *yet*.I'm gonna wait another week or two and see what happens."
"Yes CJ, Cuba seems to be going about this the right way, more so than other countries, which are a mess right now. I have no hesitation returning to Cuba, it's just getting there."
"Chris, just keep everything crossed for August...that boats waiting for you."
"Cuba made it clear that phase 3, and even more so the free entree of tourists on the main island, will depend on the international situation AND the international situation. Cuba can be on the right track, but anyone living in a country where the cases are out of control should be ready not to come to Cuba for many months."
"Sorry - off topic @49 - what is a marble ceramic tile, Terry? Is it ceramic but marble patterned? We are looking for bathroom tiles, but the only thing available is some gres at around 40CUC per m²."
"Lori @ 53,Unfortunately it's not gonna happen this summer, not worth the time and cost for such a short time ( whatever that may end up being)....but next summer....watch out !"
"Yes YaHez, likely just real, authentic, simulated marble tiles... the genuine article would be too much to hope for and likely far too expensive too. But I've seen fotos of those ceramic tiles that Judi has sent me, and for the money, not a bad reasonable facsimile.Terry"
Oh I know! The prices for that marble looking ceramic tile are crazy! Even for the more ordinary tiles too. I've seen a few different examples of those marble look tiles... some are much better than others. The type we have our eye out for are the ones that are mostly white with lines of black/grey running diagonally. Judi's on the prowl now for those. Oh what we could do if only there were a Home Depot there.Terry
"@56 Chris, I reluctantly put my boat in this season, the marina facilities are greatly limited, no showers, picnic tables and our great fish and chip restaurant is not going to open at all! In saying that I just got back from a couple of days on the boat, it was so nice to get out of town and into a different environment, I went kayaking and did some work on the boat, I'm a 2 shower a day guy normally so after 2 days I had to return home! I'll head back tomorrow and enjoy some more of this Cuba like weather and hope our local beach is open!"
