The European Union has voted to ban flights from the US. I guess the Vegas loving Brits are happy they Brexited. They might be able to fly to Vegas soon but Europeans probably can’t anytime soon.
“ The European Union has voted to ban flights from the US”They have? When was the vote?
Was today ( I guess yesterday in Europe). I heard about it on CBS radio news.
I guess they are “othering” us. lol
The EU merely acted first. I would be quite surprised if the UK or Canada lift their own restrictions any time soon either.
"Well, there goes London in Oct.Oh well, such is life.Now, the EU does welcome the Chinese, with open arms, as they did, before they were brought to their knees, by the Wuhan Virus.What goes around, comes around.Best of luck,Hunt"
"Don’t go anywhere Overseas until next year. It’s pretty bad over in Europe and UK, they got a potent and very nasty virus, different than the American and Chinese viruses. At least Las Vegas virus is all American. Have been traveling for decades, few dozens times to Europe on business, I am happy to stay put. Have a few business trips in fall, within the US, including Las Vegas."
@6A potent and nasty virus? Eh? Did we miss this. We have the same Coronavirus that is killing in America. Do we have another one? I may have missed it.
"The EU did not vote to ban Americans from Europe on Tuesday. The NY Times reported that they saw a draft document saying that they will ban Americans but that is as far as it has gone.The virus is no different to the one is the states with countries like Greece, Norway, Finland and other countries opening their boarders within the EU for travellers.Ireland itself, as of Tuesday, had 3 deaths and 10 new cases with chances of catching the virus within the ‘community’ as 1:1000000"
"What's being considered is a travel ban, not a flights ban.From the mention so far, this hasn't been properly considered. It automatically bans travel from the EU to the US, since returnees would pose the same health risk.They need to consider how this hurts the airlines, since they can survive only so long without passenger numbers. If the airlines go bust, then there is unemployment, and the social consequences from that."
"@ MAC re: #6,yes, when magnified under special high powered microscopes, the ""all American"" virus you referred to apparently has stars and stripes on its Covid crowns."
"From a microbiological point of view, there are several varieties of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. But from the epidemiological point of view, the world is dealing with two distinctly different supertypes of the coronavirus – the so called “East Asian” and “European” ones.The Los Alamos National Laboratory has posted a new study, as reported this week by the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, that finds that the strain of the novel coronavirus that emerged in Europe and has spread to much of the world is different than the strain of the virus at its origin in China. It goes on and on, widely reported in the press in the past, common knowledge. Google it yourself."
"rallen ""They need to consider how this hurts the airlines, since they can survive only so long without passenger numbers. If the airlines go bust, then there is unemployment, and the social consequences from that."" What will destroy the airline industry is if people start dying after getting covid inflight. Just like you're killing off many of your restaurants by re-opening them too early and putting them in a position where they have to close again. If you all had a good leader you'd be out of this terrible mess right now like we are here in Australia. We've only had 102 deaths.....our CONSERVATIVE govt locked us down.....this is not a partisan issue, all were on board here in Australia. With less than a handful of new cases here in Sydney over the last couple of weeks, and with no new cases in many of our states for weeks, our businesses can properly recover and we got out of it with 6.2% unemployment. It is beyond my comprehension how anyone could argue that Trump hasn't messed this up in the most tragic way possible."
"@ MAC,well seeing as there are already many studies already indicating that the majority of the early U.S. cases that started the epidemic in the U.S. emanated from Europe, not from China, you might have a problem with your claims above.E.g. https:/… And furthermore, you've provided zero evidence that ""the Las Vegas (Corona)Virus is an All American Virus"" which is the part of your post that I actually responded to.Give it up buddy, you're already standing on cracking lake ice facts-wise!..."
"MacSo if that is indeed true, where does that leave us all regarding a vaccine for a virus that apparently mutates at least 3 times within a few months and seems to mutate based on geographical location. If that is indeed the case and the virus mutates longitudinally (which therefore means the US virus is the same as the Brazilian virus), I rather fancy my chances in Europe How then do you account for Australasia, which is longitudinal on the same rough lines as Asia, but has no cases in NZ and minimal cases in Australia. A virus that respects borders. GO FIGURE."
"Britain is not part of the dreaded EU, so a trip to London should be OK. We Brits sadly still cannot fly to the US.Let's hop we all can soon travel how we wish. We are ready for a Vegas trip now, after being isolated/shielded since March."

"Gary T, it's not that it respects borders, it's that some countries managed it much better than others. As for this nonsense about them being different viruses, here in Australia we've had more cases come in from America than any other country."
"Why would anyone from europe want to go to the us with an ever increasing death rate 120,000 +, an increasing spread and total lack of action by the us??? Its not about whether the us decides to open its whether other countries want to take the risk. I want to go to vegas so bad not with the figures in the states I am sorry to say.Edited: 6:26 am, June 24, 2020 "
"Phoensam: I'm glad Australia is doing a great job handling the pandemic. (It's a country on my bucket list to visit). I do think it might be a tad easier to lock down an Island with a population of approximately 25,500,000 versus a country with a population of 330,900,000. Each State/local government needed to find the balance between health safety/economic concerns and, unfortunately, not all states/cities choose the right balance. I'm hoping that we all find the right balance soon. Stay Safe!"
