"We are hoping to book flights to Krakow for early September but are finding it extremely difficult to get up to date information about the Covid rate in Krakow. Is it stable, increasing or decreasing? If it's seriously increasing we may have to reconsider our plans as the UK puts countries on its restricted list with very little notice."
The recent trends in Kraków and generally southern Poland are increasing https://glos24.pl/rekord-zakazen-w-krakowie-…
"AFAIK the UK government puts countries on a ""red list"" if they exceed 20 cumulative cases/100,000 population over a 7-day rolling period. You have all the data on worldometer to do that calculation. Do not use ECDC's data as ECDC calculate cumulative cases over 14-day period and to get 7 day period you cannot simply half the 14 day period."
"I have done it for youThe 7 day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population in the last 7 days( 12-18 August) in Poland is 12.99"
Thank you. Really appreciate this information.
We have a trip booked for early September since last year so in the same boat as the OP.Fingers crossed all will be OK for our trips! Keeping a close eye on the figures and news in Poland.Thanks to everyone for the information.
"phytochemical, could you share how you calculated the 7-day cumulative cases, I don't see that statistic on worldometer? Thanks."
"To get the number of cases per 100,000 you have to add new cases from the last 7 days and then divide the result by 378.41 (Poland's population is from worldometer, not sure if all the agencies/governments/media use the same numbers so there may be some small differences )7 day numbers are under ""Latest news/ Updates""https:/…At the moment 7-day cases (12.99) are almost exactly half the 14 day cases (25.8). It means that despite the spikes, the situation has been pretty stable over the last two weeks so you may use ECDC 14-day data and simply divide it by 2 to get 7 dayshttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"I forgot to add- the ECDC website is updated daily around early afternoon - if the 14-day cumulative case numbers are rising, it means that 7 day numbers are rising even more.Edited: 12:18 pm, August 18, 2020 "
"The situation in Krakow has become worse in recent weeks. In July the spike in the wider Małopolska region (where Krakow is located) was mostly in other smaller places, resulting from weddings and churches, with Krakow recording very few cases. Sadly, since several days the opposite is the norm and Krakow records the biggest number of daily new cases in the Małopolska region. The official number is about 30-40 cases per day in the city but it is likely to be underreported due to inefficiency of Krakow's sanitary-epidemiological authorities.It is worrying that the new cases are not just a few places but were reported from a variety of sources, including restaurants, barber shops, offices, workplaces, police station, dental surgery etc. (source: https://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/7,44425,26216760,koronawirus-w-sierpniu-ponad-500-nowych-przypadkow-w-samym.html).For those coming to Krakow now, it is of utmost importance to follow all safety measures even if you see many locals disregarding them. Use masks, disinfect your hands frequently, avoid crowded places, prefer staying outdoors to spending your time in museums and/or indoor restaurants (there are many great places with outdoor seating)."

"Nope, the mines have already been mostly under control before the new increase started, those recent rates in Kraków and the area are mostly not related to any specific single source (like e.g. mines) but multiple different small sources."
That comes down to the question which statistics your government actually use for decision making? 7-day cumulative? 7-day average? Something else?Most EU countries use 14-day cumulative ECDC data as it's the EU agency
"Good point, appears to be 7 days, but not clear if average or cumulative, former would seem more logical IMO.""The decision is triggered when a country's rate of infection exceeds 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast France had reached 20.5""https:/…explainers-53221896"
"Why is the 7-day rolling average per million more logical than 7-day cumulative per 100,000? Is Shapps the one who does the maths for the UK government?"
"BTW, UK media seem to be using 7 day cumulativehttps:/…"
Thanks. Hard to think of two sources i have less faith in than The Sun and 'Quash Quarantine group' (whoever they are) but sounds plausible on cumulative.
"Sometimes not very respectable sources happen to be very well informed:) It seems the UK media have scaremongering for quite some time and the best way to do it would be to use the link you posted because the data is higher yet they stick to 7 day cumulative per 100,000..."
"BTW our government put City of Krakow on Covid warning list today. If nothing change, it will be announced as yellow zone like Zakopane today with additional restrictions"
"I am sorry to deliver this message , hence if you are looking for information regarding this region, Krakow is not in good place now with regards to Covid/new infections. Daily increase will place Krakow any moment in yellow zone, where restrictions are tighter. If the trend will continue, Krakow may even be classed as red zone very soon. Recommended to use masks , disinfect hands, avoid crowded places. How the situation may change soon, nobody knows.....the city is definitely not as crowded as before."
"Please. Don't panic. Stick to the facts and figures. Such posts create hysteria - and that's why we are where we are. Since the very beginning of the so called pandemic, Kraków city has had the total of 210 infections. Today it was 210, yesterday - 200, daily increase: TEN. Persons. Offical source:https:/…As a comparison, the gem of Costa del Sol, Marbella, has had over 900 infections in total since the very beginning. Marbella is 1/10 of the size of Kraków. And the entire region of Malaga has had 850 infections over the last 7 days. Still the British don't go there mostly because of the quarantine imposed by their government on return.The source, official too: juntadeandalucia.es/institutodeestadisticayc…Besides, yellow zone restrictions don't impact tourist too much. So - to anyone reading this. Read facts. Not opinions.Edited: 6:26 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"Thanks. For many people (myself included) the *key* factor in deciding whether to travel to Krakow/Poland is the likelihood of our respective govts imposing 14 day quarantine on return. UK govt is doing this at c. 30 hours notice, making it very hard to call. Nor is there a published 'at risk' register or total transparency on the measure. But as per thread above this can be inferred to a degree, tho probably with some error margin and excluding any elements beyond headline 7 day rate per 100K."
"Audioturista, I don't know where you get your numbers from. Today's daily number of new cases for Krakow city only was 58, a new record. There have been more than 600 new cases in the city in August only. The university hospital dedicated to Covid patients is already operating at almost full capacity. The overall numbers are not (yet) disastrous but the trend is clearly worsening.Edited: 5:42 am, August 21, 2020 "
"I have seen the same numbers as Jozin. Indicators set up by local authorities will put places in zones irrespective we like it or not.For records, I am not a person to place a post for people to panic. I would love people go to Krakow and discover this Magic City, have great time and amazing memories. Planning trips nowadays may be tricky and everyone should be prepared for plan B , IMHO."
"AudiotouristaLooking at the website figures you quote Krakow City has 1169 cases recorded, not 210 as you claim.Also the relatively low number of cases compared to many other countries is as a result of very low testing numbers."
"Have deleted my earlier post (which linked to https:/…coronavirus-data-explorer ) as was showing 7 day timeframe per 1m not per 100K. Former is broadly useful but not the measure seemingly used by UK govt to decide on quarantine on return. I cant readily find a direct source for the latter, only 14 day (ECDC, as per phytochemical posts) - which gives a sense but not wholly reliable integer."
"My rough calculation is that there would need to be a c. 55% increase in weekly new infections in Poland before quarantine is introduced for those returning to UK. Currently 4891 weekly new cases (to 20th Aug), call it 699 daily average, which would need to rise to 7568 (1082 daily average) to trigger the 7 day cumulative threshold of 20+ cases per 100K (assumes country population is 37,840,722 and with a bit of rounding going on. Happy if someone can confirm this looks like a reasonable calculation."
"Yes, you need 7568 cases per week to get 20 cases per 100,000 of population. I'm not sure how useful is daily average since the number of infections depends on the number of tests and mass screening initiatives. More tests catch more asymptomatic people who would normally never go to the doctor.Infection numbers in Poland tend to be high Wed-Sat (reflecting tests done during the week) and low Sun-Tue (reflecting less tests over the weekend)."
"Thanks, yes more testing = more cases so would need the testing trend data to make further sense on this Q."
Poland plans to extend flight ban to 63 countries: https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/poland-…
"An article on the UK BBC website put Poland well over 20 per 100000 on Thursday and highlighted concerns in Krakow and Katowice. Cannot say if this was 7 or 14 days thoughIt also stated that the methodology used by the government in deciding on quarantine risk was unknown, despite many requests for clarification, but it is not solely 20/100000. Factors such as testing, percentage increase over previous 7 days, local measures of control etc are also considerations"
"Thanks, reasonably sure the currently reported rate above 20 is 14 days, not 7 days. (Not least as 14 day rate is a default measure by ECDC, so widely reported). See earlier posts re. 7 day calcs. My sense is that yes there are other factors informing UK govt decision but that these are not primary, i.e they come in to play only once the 7 day rate hits 20."
"900 cases in Poland for the each of the last 2 days, worst affected area is Krakow (Malopolska).Edited: 7:03 am, August 22, 2020 "
903 new cases on 21st Aug and 767 on 20th Aug is data I've seen.
"Krakow city and Malopolska (wider region) should not be confused.The numbers from the last day are 900 for Poland, 193 for Malopolska (the worst affected region), 43 for Krakow. Kind of average for last 2-3 weeks, much higher than earlier."
"Rodneym 900 reported todayEdited: 7:20 am, August 22, 2020 "
"Poland’s health ministry announced today Kraków as Covid ""yellow"" zone. Due to increased number of infections some additional restrictions are introduced: sporting and cultural events can still take place, and cinemas will be able to operate at 25% of their usual capacity. Both indoor and outdoor premises will only be allowed to admit one person per four square metres. Other restrictions, for example on wearing masks in shops and church attendance, will remain unchanged."
Wonder how long it will be before Poland is on the U.K. quarantine List? Czechia on today. Some difficult choices to be made again for many...
