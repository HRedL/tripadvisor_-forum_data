"Hi all,Looking at taking our 5 and 9 yr olds in June 2020. Is drier season on June and what is the current Zika situation on the island? Using this June as any indicator of next year, for instance. It remains on the CDC Zika list but wasn't sure about current status among tourists?Also, we're looking at the sea aquarium resort. Is there an area where people like to stroll or take walks after dinner? How is the general safety in that area and in other shopping areas?We will need to access the Natural & Organic grocery store as an example, in the Chameleon shopping center. Or Vreugdenhil, as another, on Schubappelweg. How are those areas?Thanks!"
"That resort is right in the Mambo beach area so plenty of people normally walking there. You will need a car or taxi to the Natural and Organic Store which is on the Schottegatweg.Vreugdenhil has a good variety of organic products, again not walkable though. Both areas are fine to shop at.Edited: 1 year ago "
Zika never has been an issue here on Curacao. Locals or Tourists. But there are mosquitos.June July are the dry months and that also means less mosquitos.Seaquarium is a tourist area where you can walk on the beach. Thursday evening take a stroll in Willemstad and see the fireworks
"Thank you. I wonder why the CDC includes Curacao on its Zika list, quite frustrating. June being a drier month, will the humidity still be in the moderate to high side? Checking weather there now in early July, and humidity is approximately 70-80% most days. I know the breeze is strong but is it very humid?"
"Even with relatively high humidity you don't notice it with the nice breeze along the coast line. I don't know if the resorts exercise insect control but I am always surprised that it doesn't seem to be as much of a problem as I expect. Especially compared to here at home in Massachusetts. That said, we always bring bug spray to be safe."
There are currently no health notices for Curacao. The Zika notice has been removed.https:/…
thank you
"Perhaps Curtraveller is confusing Zika with something else? Curaçao definitely had a Zika epidemic in 2016. But as noted above, it is no longer an issue, since the majority of the island is now immune, the virus has pretty much died out. (As is the case in just about all of the Caribbean at this point.)So no need to worry!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Understood, thank you.And to your knowledge, no other mosquito-borne viruses as present in the Caribbean (chikungunya, and others?)"
"Hi. I have been here staying 1 week at the Royal Aquarium Beach hotel, and now at the Avila hotel. I have not seen one mosquito in 10 days, and not even one bite. The breezes, which can be quite brisk at times, keeps the mosquitoes away.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Thanks Mel2007Toronto. By the way, did you like the Sea Aquarium Resort? We are considering it. Pros and Cons? Why did you switch resorts?"
"Hi Benjij, Curacao had a Chikungunya epidemic.. Many people got it.Zika? There were some isolated cases where several of these cases were people who came from a zika area and got infected there. On Curacao there was no Zika outbreak."
"Hi. I don't drive, so I decided to stay in 2 different locations. Tbe Aquarium Beach Resort is really stunning, most people are members in a time share, but absolutely no pressure to buy. The hotel is next to Mambo beach, with shops and restaurants, the hotel's small beach is not that nice. The breakfasts are very good, and reasonably priced. Hemmingways at Lions Dive resort is really nice, and has entertainment most nights.The Avila hotel is closer to town in a area called Petermaie, with many nice restaurants. The hotel beaches, 2, are just stunning, the hotel restaurants are very expensive, breakfast is buffet style at 19.50 US"
"mel2007toronto. thanks. Is the aquarium resort beach at least clean. no glass, seaweed etc? Even if not the most beautiful...Is it easy to walk to another beach from that hotel if you want and carry beach chairs, umbrellas?"
