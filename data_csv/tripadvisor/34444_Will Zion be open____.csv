"Hello everybody. We have flights to Vegas booked for April 2nd returning home on the 10th. With all the Corona Virus panic , there is a lot of talk on those forums about hotels cancelling shows, shutting down buffets, ect. We have every intention of coming as long as Jet Blue is running their flights. Will everything be open in Zion? We have hotel reservations for 3 nights at The Cable Mountain Lodge. Really hoping everything stays open. Any opinions on this? Do the hotels give back your deposits if the airlines or the government ban travel????Edited: 10:54 am, March 13, 2020 "
"As of today, Zion is open and fully functioning including restaurants and hotels. That’s today. Who knows what the situation will be like in almost 3 weeks.You need to be in contact with your airline and hotel about the possibility of a refund should you cancel. No one here can really answer that question, Hopefully, you haven’t prepaid in full for your hotel rooms and cancancel without penalty within the hotel’s free cancellation time period, If you prepaid everything, then that may be a different story.Edited: 11:20 am, March 13, 2020 "
"As Connie indicated, parks are open. The National Parks Service has established a coronavirus info page at the following link. I would also continue to follow Zion's website and social media channels for any updates.https:/…public-health-update.htmYour hotel can easily advise you of its cancelation policy. If you booked direct with Cable Mountain Lodge, I think it has a 72 hour cancelation policy - pretty liberal for a remote destination. Have fun."
"Hopefully, you'll be fine. I'd be most worried about flights, I'm flying East on April 2nd, hoping the flight doesn't cancel!A bright spot will probably be a lot less visitors to Zion. With travel bans in effect it's got to cut back the amount of people! Of course, extended Spring Breaks might wipe out that advantage."
Its possible Zion could stop bus service and then have a lottery for car access tot he park on a daily basis .close quarters is the concern.any place you have bus service could institute this policynational parks will stop tours and talks by rangers where people gather
With schools now cancelled in Utah for two weeks there may be a lot of locals heading south. Except the weather doesn't look so great. I expect I'll be down there myself. It isn't spring if I haven't been to Zions.
"Dan P - we are supposed to be in Zion end of first week of April. I have a reservation at Zion lodge inside the park and a reservation at Desert Pearl. I had planned to cancel the Zion lodge reservation in favor of the accommodations outside the park. Should I opt instead for the reservation inside the park to make sure we can get our car in?I suspect our whole trip is going to unravel, but I hold out hope..."
I work for the federal govt. not the park service.What I’ve seen talked about is to have employees telework. I will have to start teleworking next week.Many states have limited concentrations in crowd sizes which also cuts seating in restaurants and movie theaters.I’d keep in park lodging and take the opportunity to get inside the park because I really think buses access will be cut ot eliminated. Same with the bus line in Springdale.
"I expect the shuttle system will stay in place,,, perhaps with modifications to allow for safe personal distance. There will just be too many people coming through not to have it operational."
The shuttles are being cleaned and sanitized daily. I think the risk is less than your air flight.
"We actually just cancelled our reservation at the Inn at Entrada in St Georges for next weekend. We’re planning to wait out the week, see what happens and then, hopefully, rebook (maybe even within the park?) if everything looks ok. Originally we wanted to stay in St George because we were participating in a spartan race that has been postponed."
"We cancelled. I really wanted to go and tried to rationalize that we would be outdoors ... social distancing, right? But there would be airports, planes, restaurants, hotel rooms, hotel breakfasts, park restrooms, shuttles, etc, and people from all over the country using these same things. Our family isn't high risk, but I don't want to risk being a carrier who could harm others unknowingly. With schools and other large entities closing, it seems like the least we can do to cancel personal travel plans and avoid large groups as much as possible. Cancelling was easy (a lot of airlines and hotels are making allowances right now), and the park will still be there later. Not telling you what you should do, but just asking that you think through the reasons things are closing and decide whether this trip at this time is really something you feel comfortable doing. Good luck!"
"Erika’s comments are dead on. While there have been no reported case of Coronavirus in that area that I’m aware of, the possibility of exposure is real. Utah now has 19 reported cases of the virus. At least six of those cases are visitors to the state that were most likely exposed elsewhere and brought with them unknowingly.All most hourly, points of interest, ski areas restaurants are being closed throughout Utah. Las Vegas casinos, buffets, show are closed. With the high concentration of visitors from all over the US to Vegas, I would stay far far away from there.Since the President is now considering curtailing domestic travel, you should not travel in the near future."
Official Statement from the CDC regarding domestic travel (as of March 11):https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlThe chatter is increasing regarding potential limitations of domestic travel.
"And this morning, there are 21 cases of Coronavirus in Utah. It’s spreading."
"People who are still planning to travel anywhere during the next two months, or more, need to consider that flights can be cancelled with no notice and typical tourist services such as restaurants can be suddenly unavailable.This has happened overnight in Park City and I would guess it could easily happen in any of the towns near the National Parks.Those who choose to travel to have. their vacations need to think about how difficult it might be to get back home when thousands of other people are trying to do the same.The airports are not going to be fun any time soon."
"I’ve spent the last hour or so systematically canceling all of our reservations. We were planning on being there for spring break. Right now, my plan is to re-book the entire trip for spring break 2021. But my heart still hurts."
"@rogo...I’m sure that’s tough and disappointing. But it a smart decision, All those places will be there in 2021.Edited: 2:28 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"I am sad reading about you people having to cancel. It is the right thing to do, but stinks. We have a 2 week trip planned to Utah/Arizona in early June and each day that goes by I have a feeling it won't happen. So many moving parts for the trip and it only takes one or two problems to ruin the whole thing. I planned/booked this trip a year ahead of time with much research and anticipation. I'll be gutted if this doesn't work out. Being forced to stay at home right now and all that entails and a retirement fund being brutalized is really getting me down. Then I think about this trip and it goes down into this Twilight Zone of suck! I'm a glass half full person. Things will be okay, but it's not fun right now."
"Yeah, we were supposed to go April 2. I made reservations at Bryce when they first opened over a year ago, calling every day because they wouldn't announce the exact date when they would open. I am on sabbatical this semester, so it is the only time ever I will be able to take a spring break trip when my children are out of school because our breaks are in different months. So I can't just reschedule the trip. At best, we will be stuck going in the heat of summer in 2021 and it just won't be the same trip. After a very rough year, my husband and I were supposed to renew our vows on our anniversary April 12 in Vegas where we were flying out. I have to be thankful for my family's health and the fact that this crisis poses no immediate job loss for me like it does for the millions of service sector workers living on the edge to begin with. But I get so frustrated with the disastrous handling of this at the federal level and how much pain could have been avoided, if preventative action had been taken in January when experts saw this coming.John Oliver had a moment in his show where he allowed everyone 30 seconds to grieve or express their anger over something they have lost (trips, events, sanity) because of the crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_066dEkycr4I just hope the human misery can be mitigated by doing our part."
"denizenRichmond_VA, I'm sorry to read about that. I almost feel bad being down about my vacation plans when there is clearly real suffering going on out there.While I won't be going during the school offseason, this trip is being used during an extra month of vacation I get for a 30th year anniversary at my job. I might be able to go in 2021 if this doesn't work out, but it won't be quite the same (and I'll have to play the hotel/park reservation all over again)."
"We're supposed to be out there around May 9th. It's our yearly family vacation with kids and grandkids and I look forward to it immensely! Unfortunately the adult kids can't reschedule their vacation time. My kids said I better get in my head we won't be going, but I'm being optimistic and hoping that things will be calming down by then! One day at a time....I feel bad for those that aren't allowed to work and don't have an income or an emergency cushion! :("
Here's the NPS webpage for Zion info -https:/…conditions.htm
"We will be cancelling as well. (Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce). I rebooked hotels for August. With museums, visitors centers, restaurants all closing, it is too much. Not too mention the Covid-19. It will spread and the best thing is to stay home. Plus, CDC recommends socially isolating for 2 weeks after traveling to anywhere and that is impossible to do in my job. I would feel horrible if I traveled and then put my family friends or co-workers in jeopardy. Sad and scary times."
"I am traveling to Las Vegas on Jet Blue on April 2 as well! We are renting an RV but we did plan on 2 nights in Vegas. We are planning on visiting Grand Canyon, Moab, and Bryce. Hopefully we will be able to at least get food from grocery stores."
"Grand Cou ty (Moab) has closed restaurants to take out only and hotels to new check ins including people who had reservations. NP visitors centers are closed. BLM was discussing limiting campground occupancy to increase distancing. Total c!osure of campgrounds TBD.Really, you should not be traveling. Better check on the status of your camping reservations, etc."
"@Horace, Unfortunately. you should cancel your trip. Things are changing by the hour in the region. The places you are planning on going are very remote. There's really very little in the way of grocery stores near Bryce and Grand Canyon. Moab is basically shut down and has stated openly on the local media that they don't want anyone coming to their town. Period. The very small rural towns in Utah do not have the medical infrastructure to handle Coronavirus cases.You are putting yourself and others at risk by just getting on an airplane and flying five hours to Vegas."
"Grand County (Moab) has already taken measures to limit RV camping along with other camping on private and public lands. They say that essential visitors and primary residents are the only ones allowed. And there must be 200 yards between campsites with no more than 10 people in a campsite. Essential visitors are those who work for a company within the area. The hotels, motels, and vacation rentals must follow the same rules - no just tourist rentals.https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/54/ed/6e…"
"We may end up canceling but right now we are still taking a wait-and-see approach. If the parks close, we will definitely cancel. If conditions on the ground get worse we will cancel. But right now, or at least until Jet Blue cancels the flight, we are still planning on going. We will continue to monitor the situation."
"Well, good luck with that plan. A lot is going to have to change in a positive direction for the yrip to work out for you."
"Since this is the Zion forum I'll just add that I was wrong and they have closed the shuttles down. They are allowing cars into the main canyon up until there are no parking spots. Then I guess they are being directed to park in the visitors center and walk. So far Springdale hasn't gone to the extreme of closing hotels- yet, though restaurants are to be take out only per the governor. Not a good time to come."
I just cancelled our trip from New York today. We are so disappointed. Every hotel I spoke to both in Vegas and Utah were very nice. It seemed like they were just taking one cancellation phone call after another. It is really devastating what this is going to be doing to the economy. And I for one am really scared that they may never let people travel again. It seems that life as we knew it in the land of the free is a thing of the past.
I just had a hotel cancel my reservation for May 5. Our plan was 2 days in L.V and then a week in Utah. I was going to wait until April to see what happened but it looks doubtful now. This night would have been at the end of the week heading back to LV.
"Texlady, it might help people to know what town your cancelled hotel is in. Thanks"
"@texlady - And an employee in the Las Vegas flight towner has tested positive for Covid19. and flights are being diverted. Who knows how long that will be in place.Things are changing very quickly in the Utah tourism industry. Three counties in southeastern Utah, including the county where Moab is located are pretty much shut town to tourism travel. Hotels and restaurants are closed. The closure happened on March 17 and is for 30 days with the possibility of being extended. These restrictions are not because there's an outbreak of Covid19 in those places. But they are in place to help prevent an outbrea and protect the local residents.. The counties involved, and Moab, do not have the infrastructure to handle much in the way of medical crises.Now, and at least for the next 30 days ,is not a time to be traveling. Stay home and do your part to flatten the curveEdited: 10:56 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Sorry. I meant to add Best Western at Brian Head. In the Cedar. Breaks area.Edited: 4:54 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Brake, I understand your terrible disappointment, but try to keep things in perspective. It will be some time before we can travel recreationally again, but it won't be forever. This is an unusual situation calling for drastic measures to protect the elderly and people with preexisting conditions of all ages. We have to eradicate this virus, and then put everything else slowly back into place. You don't want to get this thing on the plane or in restaurants, do you? I'm saying this as someone who's job was eliminated not long before this happened and knows this means I can probably at least double the time I expected to be out of work. It will take a while, but this too will pass. I had to postpone a trip to Yellowstone and Grand Teton years ago because Mom got a kidneystone. Zion will still be there. You'll still get there eventually."
