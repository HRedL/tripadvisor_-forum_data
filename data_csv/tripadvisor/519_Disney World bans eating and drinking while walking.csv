"Disney World bans eating and drinking while walking after guests break face mask rules, see here:https:/…We will return to WDW where there is an effective and safe vaccine for COVID-19 or early onset therapeutics or if COVID-19 runs it course and is no longer a threat.Edited: 1:16 pm, July 20, 2020 "
smart move
I think we knew that would come..
Makes perfect sense
Good. This was the biggest problem I saw at Disney Springs.
"I agree with this. If it didn’t happen, I could foresee people walking around with masks down carrying around a food or beverage item with the excuse that it was because they were eating or drinking."
This feels sensible. It’s just a shame that it’s necessary...
Let's walk through a theme park when it's 100 degrees and 95% humidity and force people to avoid drinking water unless they can find a relaxation station to drink water. Sounds like a recipe for disaster.
That is not what they are asking. They are asking you to step off to the side and stand still or sit somewhere if you need to lower your mask to drink or eat. They don't want people walking around with their masks off. Easier for everyone to avoid you so you aren't a moving target or spending hours with a drink in your hand just to have your mask off.
"I don't see where the article gives that option. It reads: ORLANDO, Fla. (KABC) -- Forget munching on Mickey pretzels while strolling through Disney World in Orlando, Florida.Eating or drinking while walking has been banned to ensure people are wearing masks while moving around the park."
Some folks can't walk and chew gum
"you don't need to go to a relaxation station to eat or drink. you just can't walk around. you can stop, sit and drink anywhere."
"""All one has to do is stop, step aside, and take a drink -- OMG what a burden!""I think someone was clutching their pearls when they said it's a disaster in the making. However I can't see any point in going to amusement parks either until there's a vaccine. Just doesn't sound like fun to me."
"For reasons exactly like this, I won't be going until the nonsense is over."
Agree Jen. Who wants to be the mask police? It really isn’t worth the effort. I would rather catch corona than be shot t by someone for trying to enforce mask rules.
"I see you still think the virus is nonsense sunngod.However, I have to agree that visiting a theme park with the mask rule in place will not be a pleasant experience."
"I didn’t say the virus is nonsense. I think the reaction is way over blown by the media and fuels people’s fears causing silly unnecessary responses that have far reaching impacts because people react for the now and don’t think their actions for the long term. Not trying to sound crass, but do you really want some to die or be harmed because they are trying to force someone to wear a mask? Seems kind of silly. I know the argument is that people should wear a mask, but I’m a realist and know that there are people that won’t and that is an inevitable result for a situation that doesn’t need to happen."
If Disney want to enforce masks then visitors have to follow their rules. However I do think they have gone over the top when it comes to children. Making 2 yeas old wear a mask is a bit extreme and the Orlando theme parks are very much in the minority where it comes to asking very young children to wear them. In the UK it is not compulsory for under the age of 11. Even at Disneyland Paris which is the same company as Orlando nobody under age of 11 has to wear. one. Maybe its because the virus is out of control in Florida where as most other places the numbers are coming down but requiring masks for such young children is not going to give them a very happy visit.
"""I think the reaction is way over blown by the media and fuels people’s fears causing silly unnecessary responses that have far reaching impacts because people react for the now and don’t think their actions for the long term.""I couldn't agree more!! The city/county where I work (not the area where I live) enacted a mask mandate after 4th of July weekend, but guess what? We're three weeks later now, and still no drop in ""reported"" cases and they're still going up in fact, so either the masks ARE NOT WORKING or someone's fudging the numbers to get more government money.....I suspect both."
“Making 2 yeas old wear a mask is a bit extreme and the Orlando theme parks are very much in the minority where it comes to asking very young children to wear them.”Disney isn’t making families bring their little ones to the parks. If the rule upsets the parents then the parents shouldn’t take their kids to Disney at this moment.
"Common sense, yay!I had the discussion with the wife the other night. I think I would have a difficult time with wearing at least 2 ply in the heat, so I probably won't be doing the food and wine. Having said that, the parks are available and doing what needs to be done to open right now. We have a mandate in Orange County, and it is pretty well followed in the places where I have visited. I don't know, maybe the places I go have people that understand that the places we like probably won't be allowed to open without one? Who knows."
"I,m not sure if Disney are happy with attendance numbers......Are they doing anything to encourage numbersOr just waiting for the borders to open"
"""Making 2 yeas old wear a mask is a bit extreme ""2 year old kids don't need to wear masks.Over 3 years must."
Disney website says ages two and up wear mask.
"Any vlogs I have watched concerning Disney Springs seems to be highlighting the lack of staff enforcing the mask rules. There are plenty of areas where people can sit and eat or drink.To me, these people are just going to force Disney to either close it down again or close kiosks and only have quick-serve that have outside seating with social distance seating in place.With Florida having a horrendous record of deaths and new outbreaks on a daily basis I just cannot fathom the stupidity and ignorance of these people who do not wear masks. Yes they can be uncomfortable to wear in the heat but even if you do not have any symptoms can you be sure that the person walking close to you who doesn't have a mask on is safe."
Universal now has similar language clarifying masks and walking around eating and drinking
"""We have a mandate in Orange County, and it is pretty well followed in the places where I have visited. ""That is what I found as well, in my part of town. My regular Publix is the one in SoDo - virtually everyone in the store wears masks. Granted, a handful of people that seem to think the nose is not part of the respiratory system, but everyone seemed to be complying. Same with the Target in the area."
Thanks Jamie but the reality is if the nose is out then not everybody is complying. No credit for half measures. I see the same here and it’s very frustrating.
"Bob, You really need to stop getting your news from YouTube. People are wearing masks and the infection numbers keep going up. This is confirmed by pretty much everyone that is in Florida."
"Sunngod, the problem in Florida is that things are being done piecemeal. Entire state mandates are needed. The governor seems clueless to science and it has more to do with stupidity than his political party, feelings for Trump, etc. He truly looks like he wants people to get sick and die. The fact that he is pushing for schools to reopen fully in the midst of this crisis shows his stupidity. Our governor is a Republican, but actually looks at scientific data and consults with medical experts and uses that to inform decisions. So it’s not party-specific. It’s just stupidity and denial.Edited: 10:41 am, July 22, 2020 "
"No Nat, you are completely wrong. You may want to consider a little more geography and a lot less politics in your view. Florida is a very large and oddly shaped state. A one sized fits all approach does not work here. You do realize that a trip from the Keys to Pensacola isn't a lot less than your drive from Boston to Orlando, right? You are trying to say that we should have a one sized fits all approach for the eastern sea board? The governor doesn't do whatever he wants. This isn't a dictatorship or and no one appointed him king. He is doing what the people want. In my area 8 out of 10 people want the schools open. Those 2 out of 10 have the option of keeping their kids at home with virtual options. I can't tell you what is going on in Boston. I have no idea and really wouldn't feel it was right to say what you are doing there is good or bad. You live there. You vote (presumably) for your government, You do what you do. There is one thing I do know about the science that applies to us all is that this won't go away and you can't hide from it. You either deal with it or eventually you will run out of resources in your cave and the result will probably be a lot worse than dealing with it. Your call. Your state."
"I’m not going to argue with, sunngod. Clearly we differ in opinion. The difference is, Florida cases are out of control; that is fact, not a political opinion. But you just keep living in a fantasy and think your governor is doing “what the people want.” When your hospitals get so overloaded that women can’t be seen to have babies or people with heart attacks can’t be seen, people will change their tunes."
"How did we get from walking around Disney to a lecture about schools? Which, by the way, for those that know nothing about the area , have three options in Orange County: Home , in person, and Hybrid. More BS from people that know nothing about the area and nothing about what they are talking about. Leave the politics somewhere else."
"Sun - Nat is not completely wrong. New York is a large and oddly shaped (and highly populated) State and when New York City and Long Island were going through their crisis with COVID, the Governor didn’t say “ok, everyone in NYC and Long Island need to quarantine and wear masks, and close down, etc.”, he made the decision for the entire State. I live in Upstate New York and we were not nearly as affected. There are some areas north of me who were barely affected at all, but he didn’t exclude them from the rules, we closed up as an entire State, right from the beginning. We all need to wear masks, we all need to social distance, we all follow the same rules, and we have managed to get our numbers way, way down. Our Governor also worked with the Governors of the neighboring States, including Massachusetts, so that very similar rules were being followed by everyone and so that we didn’t have people crossing the borders into areas where rules were more lax to shop, dine, get their hair done, etc.If certain portions of the State have different rules, people from parts of the State that are highly affected and have more stringent rules will just head to the more lax areas to do their business, recreation, etc. which then brings the infection to those areas.You’re right, you do vote, and you do elect your Governor, and if 8 out of 10 people in Florida think opening schools back up in the midst of what’s going on in your state (which by the way, we don’t know if YOUR State is Florida or Virginia), then that’s exactly what should happen. I just pray for everyone’s sake that there aren’t horrible consequences that come with that decision."
Surffish Seminole county has offered four options so no one is being forced to send their kids back.
"""He is doing what the people want. In my area 8 out of 10 people want the schools open. Those 2 out of 10 have the option of keeping their kids at home with virtual options.""??? not sure where you live, but it must be in the Villages, where there are no children. :o)Unless by ""open"", you are counting remote/distance learning. Even the most Trump-friendly/conservative polls I have seen, don't show a little less than 50% in favor of forcing schools to have in-person classes on their normal schedule."
"""Surffish Seminole county has offered four options so no one is being forced to send their kids back.""Unfortunately, the teachers and other employees, who are more susceptible to getting sick, don't have the luxury of choosing an option."
"JaimeLobo, believe it or not, but there actually is a charter school in the Villages."
"Well, perhaps should have said ""few children""BTW, 8 out of 10 parents around central Florida don't seem to want the schools to open. Currently, only 33% have chosen in-person/face-to-face option, the rest have picked one of the distance learning choices."
"We need to get used to masks - that is our future until there is a vaccine - which I don't think will be anytime before the end of 2021 (my opinion)30 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, have issued some form of mask mandate - more are adding them each day. Soon, you will not be able to go anywhere without a mask."
