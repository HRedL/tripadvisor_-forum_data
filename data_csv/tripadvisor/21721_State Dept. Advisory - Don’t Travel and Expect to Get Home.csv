This puts a point in the discussions on whether to go..https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/cor…Talked to a friend there today and he said places were shutting down..Not sure how many or specifics.
"Just read this it's a travel 4 advisory and the state department said you will most likely be stuck and not get back in the states. Another words international flying is prohibited since you can't get back into the states. You won't be allowed back in the states.Edited: 4:36 pm, March 19, 2020 "

"I wish they will say when the last flights will be going and coming back that would be a better barometer at least then you would know for sure what to do.Edited: 5:12 pm, March 19, 2020 "
My sister got a 1 day warning in St. Barths that the airport was closing today after the last charter flight left.Her charter flight stopped yesterday without notice. No way I would leave the US right now! We cancelled Monday.
Do not go and come home!
I only mention because Southwest puts it out on there sitehttps://www.southwest.com/Coronavirus/…
"We are here now and hopefully leaving tomorrow, Saturday on Delta, no flights available today, anyone here if there is an announced cut off point for returning to USA?"
"""anyone here if there is an announced cut off point for returning to USA?""Southwest last flights are on Sunday March 22.United hasn't indicated when there last flights are. Spirit hasn't eitherAmerican hasn't listed Mexico yet either for flights https:/…travel-alerts.jspThe reality of the situation I wouldn't try to stay anywhere outside of the U.S past Wednesday at the moment."

I read on the news tonight last fly to us on United is 3/22.
I read 3/22 for United I think it was?? Sorry not positive so I’d call to check
"Flew home last night from Cancun on Delta, uneventful and orderly. The Delta gate agent had no idea how long they will be flying, she said they were hoping to have at least 1 flight per day in & out to the states. Good luck!"
The last flight is on 3/22 for Southwest not United. This is what United says https://hub.united.com/united-flight-reducti…
"Extremely helpful, jordansbulls, thanks for posting that!"
"The advisory is important to casual travelers and should be heeded. The notice on non-essential travel applies only to the border states. There are no restrictions on air travel. Having said that, no one knows what the future holds, and anyone traveling to ANY DESTINATION must consider the risks of getting home if they are on vacation and do not have the option of staying in that destination. It’s a new world out there, and it makes perfect sense to stay put and be safe...Edited: 7:54 pm, March 22, 2020 "
Not true. Read the level 4 warning. It specifically says it’s not for US citizens and it’s not for air travel. It’s about cars at the borders because they need staff to be able to deal only with trade there.
"that's for border crossings by car, or foot traffic."
"There are still current flights to Cancun right now from the U.S. but not sure for how long, assume after spring break is done that may stop for the next month or so."
