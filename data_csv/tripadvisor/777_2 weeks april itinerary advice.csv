"Hi everyoneSince I’m going to Japan for 2 weeks whit this itinerary in april I still have the time to add one day (nikko or hakone or Himeji or Miyajama + Hiroshima) What would you advice to a first timer ? What do you think about the tokyo part ? Did I miss something ?Day 0 RestDay 1 - sunday(fyi)HarajukuShibuya Day 2AsakusaUenoDay 3Roppongi Shinjuku Day 4OdaibaDay 5AkihabaraGinza (2h maximum)Tokyo skytreeDay 6YanakaTokyo-Kyoto Day 7 - day 10All the big sights in Kyoto, I don’t need advicesDay 11NaraDay 12OsakaDay 14Departure"
I would add Hiroshima and Miyajima.
The day to wait for the result of your PCR test.
"In 2 weeks' time, definitely add HIroshima + Miyajima. Himeji Castle can be visited in a few hours while travelling en route b/w Hiroshima and Osaka.D1 - also add Omotesando (one of my fav) adjacent to Harajuku.D2 - include nearby Skytree and/or Akihabara, after Ueno/Asakusa.D6 - Yanaka can be visited on D5 if above changes are incorporated. This way, 1 day is freed up for visits subsequently in Kansai and Chugoku.Edited: 3:28 am, May 23, 2020 "
Overall looks good
You can add Yanaka to the day you visit Ueno.Tokyo Sky Tree will be better to combine with Asakusa.Roppongi and Shinjuku can be added to other days. It is best during twilight till night.
"@DLi_hkThank for your message Omotesando added’ thanksHere’s my full itinerary of D2 and tell me if I can still put skytree, and if I do that then on day 5 I’ll add Yanaka(in the morning ?) .

Okay I have an idea.Let’s say I have 2 days for day tripAs a disabled person what should I add to Hiroshima + Miyajima ?Hakone or Nikko or Himeji(half day and not accessible tho) or Kamakura+Enoshima ?Thanks

"The sky deck of Tokyo City View is definitely better after twilight.If you go to Tokyo City View, you don't need to go to the observatory of Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buidling.About Asakusa area, you can have lunch at Hoppi Street. You can put Tokyo Sky Tree at twilight time and have dinner there."
">>As a disabled person what should I add to Hiroshima + Miyajima ?what type of accessibility tools do you need ? Beware there are plenty of wooden stairs inside the Himeji Castle Main Keep as an example. https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2301.htmlAlso search on this forum for many past comments on this topic.Skytree - check out weather conditions and go on a clear day/night. Entrance fee is not cheap. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Observatory - to me this would suffice on clear days. If you're looking for closer views of Tokyo Bay / Rainbow bridge etc, consider the hotel lounges in Hotel Conrad, or Ritz Carlton on top of Tokyo Midtown Roppongi.If you're visiting in early April, don't miss sakura blossom in Shinjuku Gyoen. Avoid weekends if possible though. If you like modern/contemporary art/architecture, also check out museums in Roppongi, e.g. NAC, 21_21 Design etc are some of my fav."
"Crowded places will be closed unless a miracle medicine for COVID-19 comes out. Shinjuku Gyoen Park and East Gardens were closed this April.Edited: 10:56 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"If you cannot do stairs, avoid Nikko."
"If you come to Japan in April in order to see Cherry Blossom, you should come in Early April, not mid or late April. Actually, it's the best to come to Tokyo in Late March in recent years because of global warming. Then, it will fully bloom a few days later in Kyoto in Early April. You can understand this if you look at the following data of full bloom dates in the last 11 years in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hiroshima. https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/city.php…https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/city.php…https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/city.php…https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/index.phpThe Cherry Blossom Forecast of 2021 is going to come out in the following sites in mid January.https://www.japan-guide.com/sakura/https://sakura.weathermap.jp/en.phpIt had usually been the best to KEEP your April hotel in Kyoto in @6 months before(October) earlier than mid January until 2019. Few people visited Kyoto even in the Cherry Blossom season because of COVID-19 and many new hotels had been opened in Kyoto, so we don't know when it will be fully booked in 2021. I always have recommended to use Japanican to KEEP your hotels in the high season. Although many hotels and booking sites only allow booking from @3, 4 months before, Japanican, run by JTB, the largest travel company in Japan, which allow booking from 186 days before, is a convenient site to KEEP your hotels in the high season, as follows.https://www.japanican.com/region/japan/kyoto…If you find a better deal later in other site, you can cancel it FREE until @1 week before even in the high season: @1, 2 days before is fine in non-high season."
"Thank you for the tips, you’re quite actif in this forum !Do you think this is a good last day in Tokyo considering what I saw before ? Because I’m feeling like I’ve seen all the big spots in 5 full daysImperial palaceLunchChiforigafuchi Nihonbashi takashiyamaTokyo station to kyoto"
"If you can only come on April 2 as you said in your personal mail to me, it can be the last time to enjoy Standard Cherry Blossom in Tokyo. Therefore, I recommend you to start seeing Cherry Blossom in Chidorigafuchi Moat and Ueno Park ASAP rather than visiting Chidorigafuchi on April 7 or 8. Also, it's better to move to Kyoto earlier from Tokyo on April 5 rather than moving there on April 9. In addition, if you stay until April 17, it's better to come back to Tokyo in mid April so that you can day trip Kawaguchiko from Tokyo, where you can enjoy Mt. Fuji with Cherry Blossom in mid April as follows. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2bAy40RtHYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x4Zxz4eQMkIndeed, if you can alternatively round trip Kyoto/Osaka from Tokyo, you can and should only focus on Cherry Blossom in early April at first in Tokyo and then move earlier to Kyoto, and visit most other places in Tokyo when you come back to Tokyo. That will be a perfect plan in April."
"Well, decide when to visit Chidorigafuchi checking Chiyoda City Tourist Information.https://visit-chiyoda.tokyo/en/Akihabara is just five minutes away from Tokyo Station. EVen the following site has wrong pictures and typos, check below to get geographical notions.https:/…thingstodotokyo.html"
"Here are places to enjoy Standard Cherry Blossom in Tokyo.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3050.htmlIf it's too early to see Standard Blossom, it's good to see Early-blooming weeping Cherry Blossom at Rikugien and Koishikawa Korakuen Gardens in Tokyo, as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN7agfu1fnwhttps://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEKxfVGBRJ4https://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…If it's too late to see Standard Blossom, you should visit Shinjuku Gyoen National Park or other places as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmvrIEKcWDohttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3050_late.html"
"There are also many places to see Standard Blossom in Kyoto, as follows.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3951.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl7nlBpVBHkIf it's too early to see Standard Blossom in Kyoto, you should visit Kyoto Gyoen (Imperial Park), surrounding Kyoto Gosho (Imperial Palace), where you can see Earliest-blooming Weeping Cherry Blossom in Kyoto, as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVv8YO7NI6Ehttps://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g… The North West corner of the Garden which is close to Imadegawa Station of Subway Karasuma Line is the best area to enjoy the Blossom. If it's too late to see Standard Blossom, you should visit some places to see Late-blooming Cherry Blossom in Kyoto. It's the best to take a short ride of Taxi (@1000 yen), after visiting Kinkakuji Temple(Golden Pavilion) to Haradanien Garden, and then a Taxi again to Ninnaji Temple, where you can see those Late-Blossom, as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9psNdsS6AYhttps://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO7SqyKi7CEhttps://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…Nijo Jo(Castle) and Heian Jingu(Shrine) are also good to see Late Blossom. BTW, when you arrive Kyoto, you should visit Kyoto Tourist Information Center at first, which is located on the 2nd Floor, next to Isetan Department Store, in the huge JR Kyoto Station Building Complex. You can learn from its English-speaking Staff which Temples, Shrines, and Gardens are the best to enjoy Cherry Blossom NOW in Kyoto, as follows. https://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…."
"Don't worry too much about Sakuras. If you visit Asakusa, you will find them from September till the end of April. The weeping cherry in front of the Hozomon Gate peaks in mid March. At Ueno Park, there are ones that still bloom last week-Sonosatokizakura. Just ask before you're coming. The crowded places could be closed or blocked to avoid gatherings for a few years."
"I think that Mr. Global715255 is telling the truth, but those he listed are tiny amount of Cherry Blossom. Indeed, for example, the Cherry Blossom Report of Japan-guide.com reported that they could see Okanzakura in the entrance of Ueno Park on March 12, 2019, but their overall assessment of the Cherry Blossom in Ueno Park on the day was ""Not Opened Yet"", as follows. https:/…190312_tokyo.htmlSimilarly, they could see Late-blooming Ichiyozakura in Shinobazu Pond on April 15, 2019, but their overall assessment of Cherry Blossom in Ueno Park was ""End of Season"", as follows.https:/…190415_tokyo.htmlUnlike he who can visit Ueno Park almost every week, for most people who visit Tokyo for the first time to see Cherry Blossom, it is the best to visit those places when they can see massive amount of fully bloomed Cherry Blossom, instead of visiting those places before or after the peak season when they can only see tiny amount of Cherry Blossom. There is no doubt about that. That's why I only recommend the places where and the time when they can enjoy massive fully bloomed Cherry Blossom. Indeed, if I can see only few Cherrty Blossom in Tokyo, I wouldn't visit Tokyo, and stay home and see Cherry Blossom in my neighborhood. Foreign visitors spend much more money to come to Tokyo and Kyoto, so they deserve to enjoy Cherry Blossom at their peak season, instead of just seeing few Cherry Blossom."
"I'm not a he. Somei Yoshino is just one kind. Kanzakura starts blooming from the end of Janurary and many people enjoy taking pictures of the huge Ookanzakura at the end of February and Yokou with bright pink in mid-March. FIRST HAND REPORT. A few Somei Yoshino started to bloom on March 10 at Ueno Park. They won't count until the standard tree-Hyojunboku starts to bloom.PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE OF TOKYO might haven't known but the majority of popular Somei Yoshino spots were closed until they changed to leaves. I'm a Tokyo local, so I could appreciate the peak of Chidorigafuchi with less crowd and enjoy the various Sakuras at East Gardens but from the next week the East Gardens were closed.I see many Americans and British coming during Autumn and Winter enjoying the Sakuras, 'cause they didn't think they could see them. My favorite Sakura is Tsubakikanzakura at East Gardens at the end of February. It started to bloom mid February this year, but I couldn't have a close look of it because of demolishing the Daijyosai Temporary Shrine was going on and couldn't get close to it until it was too late.I don't know what kind of disability Mehdi K but the crowds during the peak season is even hard to handle even when you're perfectly fit. Don't forget COVID-19 might be still there. The major of Hokkaido just said, ""Coronavirus won't become virus even the Government lifted the state of emergency controls."" Avoiding where people gather is the wisest way to prevent getting infectious."

Sakura blossom is most gorgeous during peak blossom, alongside with some late sakura blooming varieties such as Yaebeni Shidarezakura - one of my fav.I have visited Japan specifically aiming for peak sakura blossoms for more than 10 times - from Kyushu to Hokkaido (except in Shikoku). Thus, I have been recommending first time sakura visitors to aim for peak blossoms if possible in terms of timing, as mentioned by Mabei-sensei. Same on japan guide and from other DE.Have also visited/spotted some early and late sakuras outside of peak season from late March. However, with a few sakura trees blooming here and there in Tokyo and elsewhere, it can be recommended to those who happen to be visiting in that timeline as ideas, but not as main dish."
"I agree with the general sentiment that seeing cherry blossoms *everywhere* makes it much more of an attraction. Casual tourists want to see the iconic views, not just a few trees. In many places worldwide, there are actually cherry trees scattered here and there. Using that logic, none of us would need to travel to Japan for blossoms. I could go see cherry trees in Hong Kong if I wanted, but the view pales by comparison.Last fall, when I was in Tokyo, we made an effort to see the golden leaves of gingko trees. We saw trees all around town, including some pretty nice looking ones at some less popular spots. However, at the end of the day, it's still the well-known spots that gave the best view. The gingko tree spotting wouldn't have been worthwhile if it's just one or two standing at some random place roadside.This discussion reminds me of something I see in the European forums. Some travelers ask for advice for off-the-beaten-path. Guess what? Off-the-beaten-path places are usually not listed as a prime attraction for a variety of reasons. A truly spectacular sight is not going to be off-the-beaten-path. An off-the-beaten-path spot is not going to be that spectacular."
"Shinjuku Gyoen Park, East Gardens, the Tokyo Metropolitan Gardens, Meguro River, some part of Ueno Park, Hirosaki Castle Park were all closed during the peak season because to avoid the spreading of COVID-19. The situation could be the same next year at least unless miracle medicines are invented."
"The advices of Mr. Global715255 are good advices for those who are coming before and after the peak Cherry Blossom Season, but not for those who want to enjoy Cherry Blossom at its best season. There are the best timing for each place to see Cherry Blossom, and that's why Cherry Blossom Forecast and Cherry Blossom Reports of Japan-guide.com are very, very popular."
"I'm not Mr., Dr.M.Abei. It's too early to forget about COVID-19."
"I think you could free up a day from Tokyo by simply adding an extra thing on to another day or two.Would 100% recommend Hakone Loop (weather permitting views of Fuji), can also book into private onsen for an hour or two.Also 100% Miyajima & Hiroshima (remember to get some Okonomiyaki - places above station).That's why I think should free up a day from Tokyo."
"I will add Kawaguchiko, one day trip is fine. Or visit onthe way to the west"
"Sorry, off topic, but do you recommend visiting Akihabara during day or night time, and what time do most places there closed? I’m not interested in restaurants, more about the interesting shops and culture there."
"I recommend putting it at the end of the day, thinking you might get some shopping bags. The stores open up to 8 pm at least. https://jp.akihabara-japan.com/Don't miss Radio Kaikan just behind the Station.http://www.akihabara-radiokaikan.co.jp/Mandarake is also popular.https://www.mandarake.co.jp/dir/cmp/index-en.html#googtrans(ja|en)"
