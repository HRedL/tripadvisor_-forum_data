Hi. My partner form the US is trying to get a tourist visa to visit me here in AU.We just received the letter after almost a year stating: that consideration will be given to whether to refuse the visa on character grounds Has anyone else received this letter? What have you done to reply to it. And if so were you successful? Thanks!
"Hi,It sounds like your partner ""has form"" ans/or didn't fully disclose their past on the application.They need to be open and honest in their reply.Cheers,Edited: 5:32 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"There is an obvious reason.... character grounds usually means they have a criminal record.If they did prison time, i wouldn't like their chances,"
Provide more details about the person. Then some people might be able to shed more light on it.
"Hi,Did you hear that after the coughing fit in parliament The Minister tested negative to Covid-19 but positive to Potato Blight ?Cheers,"
"I suggest you read this webpage for assistance: https:/â€¦characterYour partner may still be granted a visa if the character test is failed. For example, if your partner has at some stage been given a prison sentence of 12 months or more then he/she has technically failed the test and is potentially going to be denied a visa. However, of the sentence was only 12 months, it was for a non-violent crime and was served 20 years ago (hypothetical example), then the Minister may decide your partner is not a risk to Australian society and allow the visa. On the other hand, if your partner is a member of a gang then he/she will unlikely to be given a visa. It just depends. Bottom line, if your partner is not open and honest in the application and in subsequent correspondence, the chances of getting a visa are zip."
"For the purposes of an AAT review, you cannot lodge an appeal against a decision before a decision has been made. The OP said they have a received a letter that consideration is being given to a denial. That is not a reviewable decision, it is a letter of intent. Now is the time for the OP to provide as much information as they can to head off a reviewable decision actually being made. Note that before the AAT process, there is an internal review process as well, where any objection to an adverse decision is considered by a different officer than the original decision-maker."
"Sorry for the lack of info. The letter for my partner states As it says you MAY not pass by virtue of 501 6 (d) (i), it then shows you an excerpt of the 501 6 d.(d) in the event the person were allowed to enter or to remain in Australia, there is a risk that the person would:(i) engage in criminal conduct in Australia; or(ii) harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia; or(iii) vilify a segment of the Australian community; or(iv) incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of thatcommunity; or(v) represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment ofthat community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, or in any other way; orMy partners charges was quite some time ago in 2013, 2007 and 2005"
"hi sorry abotu that, i replied with more info regarding the exact reason for refusal."
"""My partners charges was quite some time ago in 2013, 2007 and 2005""But how serious were the charges and what sentence did he/she get?It may seem some time ago to you, but it wasn't that long ago and there seems to be a pattern. I don't like their chances."
"hopefully this helps a little more. we have also supplied for the tourist visa a detailed letter in his own words accounting for what happend in his youth, and that he is not that person any more. the records show there hasnt been any charges since then. he was also here on compliant travel back in 2018 with no issues for a 2 week holiday, we supplied pictures, a stat dec from myself and a letter of invitation as well to support the tourist visa. we submitted the tourist visa application last year june, and withn a month it was sent to VACCU, then we just heard bck from them the other day with this updated letter. He is definitely not in any gang, i have absolutely no charges on my file, i would like to think it would be less likely he would engage in criminal activity while visiting his partner who has no charges?it is just a very hard and frustrating process to think of what else we could possibly add to show thathe will once again be here for compliant travel, i am happy to be held liable for anything because i know there would be no issues. If i could request a phone interview as well i would to talk about his character knowing him for about 6 years"
"3 separate charges doesn't create a picture of someone who has successfully turned over a new leaf, sadly.I can understand why his visa may be rejected. Someone in an office somewhere has to build a picture of this man, known only to him on paper and on paper it doesn't looks good.You can't show he's a reformed character, you can only give your opinion based on the time you have known him."

3 charges over a 8-9 year period doesnt look good on paper - i have heard stories and seen on TV shows where people are refused based off only 1 charge....
"<< Having a partner in Australia is not an advantage when applying for a tourist visa, it could well be seen as another reason to deny a visa >>This is an important consideration. The immigration authorities will consider that the applicant may intend to overstay the visa and remain in Australia, due to having a partner here. Having an Australian partner is therefore a significant detriment to getting approval for a visa which is supposed to be for tourism, meaning self-supported and leaving the country after a short period."
"Hi,Your partner's passport photo wearing white robes and with a burning cross in the background may have adversely influenced the outcome ?It looks like a ""new partner"" or a trip to the USA is in your future.Cheers,"
