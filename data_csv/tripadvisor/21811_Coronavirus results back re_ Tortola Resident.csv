"Does anyone on Tortola know when the ""official"" coronavirus testing results from the resident who recently returned from China will be released to the public? Should be by tomorrow given the 4 days to send sample off island, yes? The following statement was made on Feb. 28th on Government of BVI media website, ""Test results will be available within three (3) days, while the health surveillance team is conducting contact tracing and monitoring of persons who have had close contact with the individual."" Thank you."
Thanks for keeping us informed. 8 of us are scheduled to sail out of Tortola the week of April 6 and we're anxiously following all news reports.
"Sorry, didn't mean to mislead anyone.....I should have added a ? mark to my title: Coronavirus results back? Re: Tortola resident.Government officials stated on February 28th that it would be ""3 days"" 'til results......no word yet. We are scheduled to Tortola on March 10th and are apprehensive given the very fluid state of international travel at this time."
Thanks for starting this thread! Fortunately no cases in PR yet since we fly through ... and I figure we've got to be safer on a small cataran versus a massive cruise ship.

"Totally understand that being that I am a medical professional. My question is not intended to create ""panic"". A government body withholding or not being forthcoming with information after they committed to sharing that information creates confusion/mistrust. People need to make ""informed"" (not panicked) decisions for themselves and their families while traveling abroad because this is all a very fluid situation. Many people are concerned with management of infrastructure and rules of engagement changing by governments, my own included. Over and out, best to all."
This tells me all I need to know:https:/…
Rumor?
The results are back and are negative.https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
"That's good news! We're scheduled to sail on a catamaran the week of April 6 ... and I'm holding out hope we can do the trip. At least 2 in our party of 8 wants to cancel. What could be safer than being moored at an anchorage with just 6 other people? Seems pretty low risk to me.Or am I under reacting?Edited: 9:43 am, March 06, 2020 "
You are not under reacting at all - BVI has a reasonably good public health system and is not a hub for a lot of travelers from areas with a lot of cases.
"We too are scheduled to arrive in early April. I change my mind every 5 minutes. It isn't the being there that concerns me, it is flying there or having flights cancelled last minute. Under most scenarios, this is an ""exclusion"" to trip insurance policies."
"If your flight is cancelled and you cannot get to your destination or your are quarantined, travel insurance might pay. The policy I bought for my trip to STX in May would cover those things. If flights are cancelled, that is something that would just have to be dealt with when it happens.Someone on the USVI forum posted a very good question, ""If you won't cancel because of the seasonal flu, why would you cancel for this?"" Good point, IMO."
I guess the answer could be that we are vaccinated against flu. But the overarching idea is the same-we shouldn't live in fear.
"I think for many people. the fear is worse than the virus. Unless you are immune compromised, elderly or have a chronic illness, most people do not get very sick and some don't even know they have it. Yes, there are some outliers where this does not apply but for the majority of people that is not the case. I am not diminishing the people who get it and will get very sick and/or not make it, but there is a lot of unnecessary panic. This is not Ebola we are dealing with.You may be vaccinated against the flu but the normal flu vaccine is not particularly effective.Go on your vacation and ENJOY! I am planning on going to STX in May and just hope the flights are ok."
Please keep the communication going. It helps others to make decisions. We are heading to BVI for a week sailing at end of March and are certainly in doubt of going or not going. It seems that it is still safe but it can change quickly and we can be stuck in quarantine there.
We leave tomorrow for our week long sailing trip! Not worried about at all!
"We don't leave until April 3 --- it's going to either a lot better or a lot worse! But where else to have a safe vacation other than on a boat, floating on a mooring can?And let me add that when I opened this thread and the first post was about half and half/coffee creamer, it put a smile on my face!Edited: 9:43 am, March 12, 2020 "
Does anyone have a better read/interpretation of this announcement?https://bvi.gov.vg/media-centre/government-v…
"This isn't a better interpretation but I pulled this off the CDC website:Depending on your travel history, you will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time you left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).Countries that have a Level 3 Travel Health Notice (widespread, ongoing transmission):China (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)More information for Travelers from China arriving in the United StatesIran (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)Italy (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)South Korea (Level 3 Travel Health Notice)"
"So if we arrive from Chicago with no symptoms, we'll be ok??? I'm not sure it implies that they're only worried about the Level 3 countries."
"From the BVI Quarantine Advisory linked above: ""*According to the WHO, 'affected areas' are considered those countries, provinces, territories or cities experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19, in contrast to areas reporting only imported cases.""We cancelled our trip yesterday as we're in the age group that has been strongly discouraged from air travel, which in our case necessitates 3 separate flights and stops at several airports, plus a hotel in San Juan en route. Further complicating matters for us, we're only a couple of miles from a current coronavirus hotspot in NY and soon to be part of a tri-state hotspot; i.e., NY, NJ & CT. Potential quarantine has been our biggest worry about our long-scheduled month-long trip to Tortola. We were to fly there next week. It's now likely that the first 14 days of our vacation would, in fact, be spent in quarantine. Everyone has to make their own call, of course, but in our case, the decision practically makes itself, alas. Time to unpack. Stay well, BVI."
"Let us know if you end up in quarantine for 14 days. We are scheduled to go on April 17th, travelling from the US."
"I was searching around on the government website and found this:Travel advisory The Ministry of Health is raising the travel advisory alert from level 1 (Practice Usual Precautions) to level II (Practice Enhanced Precautions) for South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Germany, France and Spain.This was posted at 3:42 today. You can find it on their website, then go to media releases.Edited: 4:56 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Well, that's that I guess. US citizens ""will be subject to enhanced screening and possibly quarantined"" if you step foot on Tortola. We were going to BVI in two weeks and now we are not. Oh well, maybe next year.Edited: 12:52 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"@Tommycod. Did you have cancellation insurance? Are they rebooking you free of charge? Our charter company is giving us a hard time to rebook! We’ve been emailing them for the past week and they still are not giving in!Edited: 2:12 pm, March 14, 2020 "
I have a trip scheduled March 21-28 sailing out of Tortola. Worry about travel restrictions coming back into US. Don’t want to get stuck
"We have a trip scheduled March 21-28 coming from California. Don’t want to get stuck, due to travel restrictions coming back into the US!"
"We rented a villa and they have said ""no problem, let us know when you want to rebook for."" I am confident that they would reimburse but I may try to go in May."
I doubt you would have a problem coming back to the US. Its getting into BVI that's going to be the issue so far.
Which company?
We are with the Catamaran Company departing the 21st. No sign of allowing us to reschedule. You?
who are you chartering from?
We will contact our charter company tomorrow to reschedule. We hope it will be easy. We chartered from Dream Yacht.
"What booking company did you use. We are suppose to leave on Friday, traveling through Puerto Rico and then get a charter in Tortola. I’m afraid of being stuck there!"
"September S, I seen a post titled ""BVI quarantine"" under the British Virgin Islands Forum with someone posting this...""We arrived in Tortola today and they had a Heath screening upon arrival. We were also told that beginning tomorrow 3/15, all people arriving from High Risk areas will have to quarantine for 2 weeks upon arrival.""I've seen that this is the place to go for up to date info... www.bvi.gov.vg/covid-19"
"No new news from our end..... The Catamaran Company is sticking to their bottom line and ensuring us everything is fine. They refuse to allow us to reschedule. Being Canadian, the transportation minister just released a statement citing all Canadians outside of the country should return ASAP before any borders start to close! On top of that, the BVI government has released a statement regarding quarantine measures for any persons coming from a high risk countries, USA being one of them. Not to mention the cruise industry has shut down, VRBO rentals released a statement that all rentals will and should be reimbursed and/or rescheduled. To top everything off, this was the title of the newsletter they emailed out yesterday...Latest Update on This Weekends BVI Departures. In In light of COVID-19 in the USA, we are grateful to report that there is no better place to be right now than aboard a Lagoon 52 sailing in the British Virgin Islands. During this worrying time we wanted to update all of our customers on the status of what is going on in “Nature’s Little Secret”. We fully understand the seriousness of the worldwide situation and are following every guideline from the relevant authorities…but we wanted you all to know that the British Virgin Islands are open for business and virus-free. I’m at my wits end. This is getting ridiculous! Has anyone else had any luck?"
"SARguy- I just posted this on another BVI forum but here ya go:""Cabinet agreed, effective Sunday, 15th March, 2020, to suspend travel to the Territory by visitors, where that person has travelled to, from or through affected countries as defined by the WHO in its list of special interest countries"" I would imagine that coming from Canada you are traveling THROUGH the US. For your charter company to be sticking their heads in the sand is irresponsible at best. At this point, there is no way they can argue their point and I am sure you have recourse."
"We have a charter booked thru the Moorings for eight nights starting April 16. We are scheduled to arrive on Tortola April 15 and get on the boat April 16. The Moorings is also not offering any sort of refund or rebooking at his point for us. How sad as I would love nothing more than to be able to complete this vacation. However, I do not want to have to risk quarantine or shortage of provisions on a small island that is most likely not prepared to handle even their own people and this virus. Obviously I do not want to bring the virus there as well. These charter companies seem to be the unreasonable parties in this situation and are the only ones not offering rebooking and/or refunds and the ones that are putting their islands at risk. I have been going over and over my travel insurance documents trying to make heads or tails as to what may or may not be covered in this instance. I do know that if the Moorings doesn't step us and offer at least a rebooking, better yet a refund as I could have great difficulty rescheduling due to my job as we are part of a 10 boat flotilla and have no say as to when it is rescheduled."
"@wrinkldogs. Sorry to hear about your misfortune as well! There has to be quite a few of us who feel this way. There’s no way these companies should be getting away with this insanity! I get it, stuff happens but this is a global pandemic. Regardless of insurance they should be looking out for their island and then secondly the well being of their clients. We all need to band together and raise some hell. Anyone have some reporting friends? Lol. I provide an essential service and cannot afford to be quarantined for 14 days either in the BVI’s or when I return back to Canada."
"I called Dream Cruises and they reassured us that people are still coming in to BVI and starting their trips this weekend. As stated before, we are suppose to go this weekend, March 21. Here in California, practicing social distancing, school closed, bars and restaurants closed. How is the trip going to be a vacation, if we can’t get off the boat. BVI.gov stated that islands around are closed. I need a honest answer from these companies!Edited: 11:44 am, March 16, 2020 "
We are in the same situation. Are you by any chance chartering w moorings?
We are with Dream Yacht Charters.
I read @ 5 charters are allowing you to reschedule I hope they all follow suit. We have 7 people planning on a 8 day sail April 15th still nothing from our charter company

"Yes it's time to start listing who's allowing postponements/refunds and who isn't. Because if we've booked the wrong charter company, the least we can do is warn future travelers about our loss of $$$. I believe our group was using BVI Charters and so far, they haven't been helpful for our April 3 departure. If I have the name wrong I'll come back and correct it."
"Agreed! Let’s keep this going here! We booked with The Catamaran Company. It’s our third trip through them and we are scheduled to depart the 21st. We’ve been on top of them to let us reschedule and they have stuck to their bottom line. They continue to pretend that there is not a problem and that life is better on a Lagoon 55 in the BVI’s this week (that was their kicker line in the last email). The owners are all crooks. Terrible to think they’d rather make a buck than have someone carry the virus into their country, that’s if you even get past the mandatory screening before you enter the country!I did read that TMM charters is also offering free changes (updated on their website today)."
"Here's the latest from the Moorings ... If I read this correctly, you're still out of luck trying to rebook for an upcoming BVI trip (because it's ""yellow"") https://www.moorings.com/travel-advisory"
"Thanks for this post. It was extremely helpful to us, as this is 3 days before we were to travel. And it was going to be a total loss due to Moorings. Thank you very, very much!"
"Well, BVI is now closed to Tourists. So sad for all!"
BVI as of 3/17/20 looks like non residents not allowed. Especially read #6 and #7 of this announcementhttps:/….XnIKXDX1qdY.gmail
"Well now the next question is will we get a refund from the charter companies? In all fairness, the island is shut down! All I have to say is our company should have taken the liberty to allow us to reschedule. Instead, they refused and came up with every excuse in the book. I’ll be sure to get my money back and go else where from now on."
I just sent the news to our group and said now's the time to contact the charter company again. I was hoping we'd get this before our April 3 departure so we'd have some basis for a refund/reschedule. I feel bad for everyone who's already lost money and I'm jealous for the folks who made it there this week!
"We came down on January 12, 2020 and planned on staying until April 30. The BVI’s have no known cases, we can find. The bars and restaurants are restricted on 30 people max capacity. Most of the bars like Soggy Dollar are now closed. The islands have officially closed all travel in and out of the islands until April 6. bvi.gov.vg/media-centre/bvi-government-imple… The bays have few boats but, there are still sailors and cruisers here. I have a compromised immune system so it’s good timing. If there is one?!? Food and provisions seem plentiful and there is no underlying panic. The residents could not be friendlier. BTW, Willie T’s was still open as of last night. We are currently in the Bight on Norman Island. Take care!"
"Hi! Did you make your trip after all? I hope so. We are hoping to set sail on a similar trip in mid-May, and I’ve been anxiously watching for any signs that we should cancel. We also have concerns about the solvency of the company for the next 12 months during which we’d have to rebook if we rescheduled. If you learned anything about cancellation/rebooking practices since your post, please take a moment to fill me in! (I am sure it’s company-specific, but I’m thinking there might be a general approach that people are taking in that industry and area these days.) Thank you!"
"We were suppose to go on our trip, March 21-28 with Dream Charters. They have reschedule our trip for March 2021, but we will need to pay an extra $298."
Thanks for the update!
I have heard that the boarder have been shut down. i also have BVI yacht charters and they will not give in. My question is how can i take my charter if i am not allowed into the BVI
"Hi,After some back and forth with the person who booked our charter, it looks like we'll be able to rebook about a year out from now, with a rebooking fee. Of course, as someone mentioned here, if any of these companies close their doors we are still out our $$$.We're also still waiting on airline refunds, which were insured. Any luck there?"
"Not related to insured tickets, Delta is waiving all change/cancellation fees for flights booked through May 31, 2020, an ecredit is available for 2 years. Not sure what other airlines are doing...Are you talking about trip insurance reimbursement via a claim for your airline tickets? Or something else?"
