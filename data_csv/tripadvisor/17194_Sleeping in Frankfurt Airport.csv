I'm following a fine old tradition I learned during the backpacking days of the 70s; sleep for free at the airport.I'm now into unsupported bicycle touring so I'll have my bike. Any nice little secret (quiet) places in the Frankfurt airport where I can put down my sleeping bag?
"In March, I flew out of Terminal 2 on Delta to JFK. I can't remember the exact gate, but I had time to wander around. There was a whole section of what looked like unused gates with no people around. "
"Ya know, there is this new-fangled thing called ""couch surfing"" where you can also stay for free. Why sleep in the airport???"
"If you're airside, there is one reasonable place to sleep, I believe in Terminal 1C, which is a very pleasant atrium-like area that used to be used by El Al, and now is used for flights to the US. Therefore, access to this area might now be limited to only passengers actually using those gates. However, there are no arm rests on the seats so that you can stretch out and sleep, which I've done for a few hours in the past. But if you have your bike, you won't be in this part of the airport.The Lufthansa area of Terminal 1A is quiet and might be a good choice on the nonsecure side of the airport, at least that's my choice of a quiet place to have a seat."
"""Ya know, there is this new-fangled thing called ""couch surfing"" where you can also stay for free. Why sleep in the airport???""Bornheimgirl, I am well aware of these various arrangements. Please be aware of what works for one person, may not work for another. In my case, my flights back to NA leave very early in the morning. Since I am travelling with my bicycle, I have to be there 3 hours ahead (around 04:00). Since I have a sleeping bag and mat, airport sleeping is not only possible but convenient."
"Well, since none of that information was in your original post how would I be aware of it? If you would have posted that at the beginning, I might have responded in a completely different manner with completely different suggestions. "
"What kind of mat do you use, Shtokel?Due to the worldwide bedbug epidemic, I am thinking of sleeping on the mat instead of a hotel bed."
"""What kind of mat do you use, Stokel?""________________________________________________I use a self inflating camping mat, that I blow up a bit over the self inflating feature. It deflates and stores into a very small package (just a bit larger than a 2L PET bottle. It weighs almost nothing. I bought it at Mountain Equipment Co-op in Toronto, but there are many other similar products.I never thought of the bedbug problem, but I usually just camp anyway."
