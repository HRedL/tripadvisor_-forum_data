Somehow I doubt that unless there were many unexplained deaths it wouldn't get picked up in Gambia. I can't help feeling the hospitals there would just put it down to malaria or such like.
"I am just wondering if it is safe to travel on Tuesday, this virus is spreading like wildfire in the Uk"
Thanks
"I'd hardly call 36 cases ""wildfire"" and if it is then Gambia is a safe altenative"
"Hi Abi,if you are due to travel on Tuesday I would still go and not worry too much about it.There aren't that many cases in the UK and unless you are someone who has other health issues it would be similar to the flu virus anyway.There are far far more people who die from malaria in The Gambia and other countries which is much more worrying ."
best advice from https:/…the-gambia
Andhttps:/…coronavirushttps:/…public-health-england
Get to Banjul airport and they supply hand wash and take temperature - Come to U.K. and they just let you in without any checks. At least the Gambians are making an attempt to keep the Corona virus out.
"To be honest it is not practicable to check everybody landing in the UK. There are far too many passengers coming in from all over the world.Also, you can already have contracted the virus in an infected area just before you have left and not showing the symptoms yet. People from northern Italy are such cases who are now deemed to have infected others in the UK.Edited: 5:51 am, March 02, 2020 "
Case confirmed today in Senegalhttps:/…
@Easyltime. Thanks for the information at post #11. That really negates the answer at post #9 where at Banjul airport they take your temperature and supply hand wash. I cannot see that happening at the road border crossing with Senegal.

As I understand it the face mask are completely useless as regards preventing the wearer from catching it as the particles are so small they pass through the face mask. They would of course catch fluids expelled by the wearer coughing and sneezing - but only if they are worn correctlyhttps:/…when-and-how-to-use-masks
I think the 105 degrees heat will kill me before any virus.
Wildfire in the UK ?:-). ;-) :-) :-)
If you get the virus in Gambia or get into isolation in Gambia you will have a serious problem with health services
"Post 21, but at least you will have sunshine.I can think of worse places to be stuck in and you should have travel insurance ."
But would a stopover and the costs of a period of voluntary quarantine be covered by insurence? Its a whole new concept.If I didn't have to get back to my dog I might test it! Only eleven days in this stunning temperature is not enough!
"Gambia / Africa is not really a place to be if the plague takes hold here. Poor medical facilities, poorer hygiene and very poor communication by the government.The dangers from lack of proper handwashing not just cold water form a striped kettle are obvious. As are the dangers of filthy banknotes.What about the humble tapalapa, how many people have handled it before you get to eat it. In our village shop they are stacked behind a mesh with people coming and going, coughing sneezing etc. The shop owner handles notes, and prepares bread with varios spreads without any running water or hand washing facilities available. How long is it since he washed his hands. FYI; from WHOCan I catch the coronavirus by eating food prepared by others?We are still learning about transmission of COVID-19. It’s not clear if this is possible, but if so it would be more likely to be the exception than the rule. That said, COVID-19 and other coronaviruses have been detected in the stool of certain patients, so we currently cannot rule out the possibility of occasional transmission from infected food handlers. The virus would likely be killed by cooking the food.https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/hea…Edited: 5:57 am, March 08, 2020 "
"I read that the virus will not survive in temperatures over 27 degrees and in strong sunlight.. It cannot live on your hands for more than 10 minutes. It can survive on a metal surface for 12 hours.Given that, those of us who have been here for a few weeks in temperatures above 27 degrees are probably more likely to catch it from a tourist who has just arrived from an infected city/country, sat on a plane with others for 6 hours and mixed with people from EVERYWHERE in an airport terminal. Beware of pale people coughing and sneezing!!!"
"There is an awful lot of misinformation going the rounds on social media and on forums about how long and where the virus can survive. There is a link on TA belowhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019Having said that, the WHO advice is given below and updated on a daily bases:https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019"
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"Have to give the Ministry of Health their just dues. They are going around villages explaining the issues and ""sensiitising"" the community.They have also stepped up screening at the border posts."
"Post 26.I was quoting from an article written by a Professor of microbiology not the gossip of chat rooms. The WHO info is interesting, but I would question if keeping apart just a metre is sufficient to avoid droplets etc. Good that this thread is encouraging debate and information. Personal hygiene is the issue in this country. Good to see the authorities are sensitising people to sanitising!"
Post 29The reason I posted as I did was that I DID read that the virus can withstand temperatures far in excess of 27 degrees. The statement attributed to WHO (I need to find it to post for you) says 60 degrees Centigrade.I would be most grateful if you would please find the article that quotes 27 degrees to share with us?

"Wow - post 31 . You can seriously make a racist statement like this and think its OK :  ""Africans have no education in hygiene of any sort. "" I would love to show this to some of my African friends. Absolutely outrageous. Lets hope none of the tourists infect these ""Uneducated Africans "" with coronavirus."
"Destiny, possibly a bad choice of words but there is no doubt that the normal hygene levels expected in Europe are certainly lacking here. Personal hygene in some is generally poor but environmental hygene around some of the villages is certainly lacking. Rubbish is strewn everywhere and that just increases the chances of many diseases as children play around these areas."
It is still a hugely racist statement for any African people who happen to read this (maybe) and probably a Troll. You should see some of the rubbish lying around London streets and also train passengers coughing and spluttering all over the place even now. If people think Africa and the people are so backward and dirty then they should stay away. SImple.
"It is not racist just a fact, there is almost no understanding of basic hygeine precautions in Gambia. Yes london has rubbish but nothing like the rotting piles that are strewn around almost every village. There are people who seem to spend their lives looking for racism, sexism, misogyny, transphobia etc. They need to get out more."
"I get out all the time actually.It is RACIST . Superiority and white privilege views as usual.Edited: 8:12 am, March 10, 2020 "
"The line used was :""Africans have no education in hygiene of any sort.Is this a blanket statement on ALL africans? . Amazed that with those kind of views why white privileged people even go to the Gambia as africans are so unclean. I hope the locals don't shake hands with the tourists who no doubt will spread coronavirus there too. As if malaria isn't bad enough."

Are all whites privileged ? Can a white person be racist without being priveleged ?
Re post 31A sweeping statement about Africans hygiene or just a load of nonsense?For your information and possibly education Africa has a population of around 1.2 billion people. How many do you know?
"Yes, Tricky D - exactly!!!!! The offending line in Post 31 IS racist ""Africans have no education in hygiene of any sort."""
Is a white privileged person someone who has worked all their life to enable them to live where they wish.I hate to say this and I know that Destiny is going to throw a fit but in my travels during both service in the Forces and as a civilian living and working abroad I have found that racism in Africa and the Middle and Far East far exceeds that found in Europe

"Why would I have a fit? For anyone who has no issue with the offending line in Post 31, I suggest you read a book called “Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire” written by Akala . He is of mixed heritage but very educated and intelligent (!!!!!) and he can explain White Privilege from his perspective. It is a good read."
"Eazytime, a person who has had a free education and been able to work all the life to earn money is privileged relative to a lot of Gambians."
"I remember learning about hygiene I school. Cookery and home economics are the two subjects that one gets basic hygiene education and I believe hotel school do pay attention to that but I am not 100% as i have never attended. As that been said, i cannot say i practiced what i learnt i school back in the day just like my students and my entire school are neglecting my special handshakes. Ever other teachers think i am silly for offering a different handshakes. The virus is already in Sweden and in our region."
"I would like to know if there will be plans to ban the European travelers that are flying from countries with the virus. Do you have any information about the plan of the Gambian government ?Edited: 2:10 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Maybe we will be gathered in protection camps.
So would I.I am part of a team of seventeen who are supposed to be going on April 14th. All of us are staying for a week and some a few days longer.We live in London or within striking distance.It is common knowledge that the virus is spreading through the UK. At the moment we have had no hint of a suggestion that we will not be allowed to go so I will follow this thread with close interest.My biggest worry is that my wife and I might get stuck there as we have things we must do immediately we return. We have paid for our air tickets. I have not re-read the small print but I would be surprised if we were allowed to cancel and get a refund.All advice and suggestions welcome.Tony

Unless a travel ban is put in place or the UK travel advice were not to travel to Gambia then your insurance wouldn't cover you if you choose not to go.

Thanks Traveller AS.The dilemma for me is having heard how dependent Gambia is on tourism.Overnight opinion here in the UK is that we are not taking stringent enough measures. But I will follow what Gambia does closely.Tony
This may help Tonyhttps:/…
Does anybody know if finally Gambia opened its eyes and start banning the flights from Europe ? There is no other way I can get my holiday's money back ! It is insanely stupid they are still allowing flights from infected countries ! WHY ? What the hell ?
"ffazi0I understand your frustration. I share it.However, this is the first website and thread where I have found a discussion. It seems to be attracting a few trolls but be patient. I think we will hear when there is a change in attitude."
Thank you for your answer. Let's hope Gambia will ban flights from Europe. It is utterly stupid for them to risk so much .... I want to stay in NL and not going to risk to be put 14 days in quarantine in Gambia ! What if I get sick ? No way really !
ffrazi0 - Stay in NL - Nobody is forcing you to go to The Gambia. You are only upset because you might lose the flight money.
ffazi0 and other interested parties. Until such time as the Foreign Office make the decision to not fly then flights will continue.In all fairness TG is working at promoting awareness amongst the population and MRC have agreed to carry out testing for anyone concerned they may be infected.
"@Gazza Yes. Of course I am. I am alredy worried enough for my parents 80 years old in the middle of the outbreak in Italy and for my family and my child here. Of course I want my money back .. what's wrong with that ?Edited: 8:53 am, March 13, 2020 "
@EasyTime thank you for your answer. I hope things will change. The world is closing up and so are doing many other African countries for their safety.
@EasyTimeTake a look how many countries are imposing travel bans:https:/…1580226297.htm
"@ffazi0, am quite capable of reading, I am merely reporting what is happening here and how the decision is made.During the Ebola crisis there were several meetings hosted by the High Commission attended by the then Wardens and numerous interested parties and the decision to repatriate tourists was only taken after a great deal of discussion. At the time the decision was made there had been NO cases of Ebola in country .To my knowledge there are NO cases of Covid in country but Senegal has 4 cases."
"Easytime,apparently over half of the more recent cases in Vietnam were imported on flights from England so it's not so much about it being in Gambia at the moment so much as bringing it in. I don't know but with poor nutrition and everything they may not cope with it as well as people in Europe.(I'm just referring to individual resistance not the health system and lack of it in terms of intensive care)"
"jeffbrum, I do wish people would read what I wrote. I am not disputing any of what anyone quoted, I am merely reporting how the decision was made regarding the FCO and The Gambia.How the varying countries have decided was their decision, the UK has taken a different approach. Is it right or wrong? Only time will tell."
Are there any additional checks being done atm on entering the Gambia?

"At the moment people in Gambia may think CV may not get here. They are probably wrong, and when it does arrive given the living conditions, infrastructure, health services the mortality rate could be much higher than Europe.FLU Pandemic 1918/19Of all six continents, Africa – and particularly sub-Saharan Africa – suffered the highest average mortality rate in the pandemic.[1] On the causative H1N1 influenza virus, its possible evolution and the highly infectious and life-threatening character of the pandemic it drove, see the entry in this online encyclopedia for “The ‘Spanish’ Influenza of 1918-1919”. That entry refers to the pandemic’s three distinct but related waves, an infectious but relatively mild first wave in March-July 1918, the deadly second wave in August-December 1918, and a serious but more moderate third wave in 1919.In the case of Africa, only North Africa and, belatedly, a corner of southeast Africa, appear to have experienced the first wave. This means that, unlike the Americas, Europe and Asia (all of which were swept by the first wave), most of sub-Saharan Africa’s initial exposure to the pandemic was to the lethal second wave. The corollary of this was that the bulk of its population, unlike most other inhabitants of the world, had no opportunity to contract first-wave “Spanish” flu and thereby develop a degree of immunity to its far deadlier successor a few months later. They were therefore hit by the full, unmitigated force of the pandemic’s second wave – and it showed. https:/…influenza_pandemic_africaEdited: 6:02 am, March 16, 2020 "

My cousin is in the Gambia now ... no caronavirus there but 3 in neighbouring Senegal ... his pictures he has put on his Facebook page are beautiful ... go and enjoy
26 cases in Senegal now According to the WHO.
Hi are flights still going to Gambia cos am planning to go by April
Currently yes but probably not for much longer. TUI has already stopped flying I believe.
In view of how this virus is spreading I hope that all flights are cancelled. Containment does mean getting on a plane as a potential carrier and spreading the virus.
Given that it is spreading in the community within Senegal then it will come here sooner or later.
"As TUI and some of the Scandinavian operators have stopped flying customers there I cannot see the hotels staying open for a handful of British guests, it may be more economical for them to shut up shop. Leostaid"
