"Can I presume your place of employment will require you to be off work for fourteen days after you return? If your state requires it then your employer must follow that. Then.....you stay home for fourteen days in quarantine. Not sure what you mean by enforcing it. Don't you plan to quarantine? Kinda sounds like you are looking for a way around it. :(Edited: 5:03 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"It is a CDC requirementhttps:/…after-travel-precautions.htmlSo especially since you are health care, it should be manditory for you.BL the people you know or people who find out could notify the CDC. Also your health care facility should make you quarantine or they are also irresponsible.for not foliwing guidelines.Edited: 5:06 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"""It is a CDC requirement""Actually, I think it's a recommendation from the CDC. I'm not saying the 14 day quarantine after international travel is or isn't a good idea. But I don't believe the CDC has the power to make quarantine a requirement. It's only their suggestion. Obviously your state can adopt that recommendation and make it a requirement but that's a different story."
"It does sound like you are trying to skip it and as healthcare workers that’s concerning. I really don’t know what people mean when they say stay safe. That implies it’s in our control and that’s not 100% true. Yes absolutely we can reduce risk by mask, hand sanitizer and social distancing. But you cannot control everything. Any airport and plane trip will introduce variables you cannot control. And there are so many asymptomatic positives it’s very easy to get exposed. I know five people with asymptomatic positive tested after travel or prior to medical procedures. If we as a country are going to get numbers down we need to take recommended quarantined seriously without enforcement."
"quarantine when arriving... My wife and I are both in medicine and are considered essential workers, and so are you. We are planning on traveling in August, however that may change, so I looked into the return quarantine recommendations. The rules are (of course I would double check with your employer) that if you are considered an essential worker, you DO NOT have to quarantine as long as you are symptom free. If you begin to show symptoms, you will then have to be tested. If positive, then quarantine for 14 days. If you need further proof of this, please look up Gov Cuomo's (NY) quote/answer to being asked if he had to quarantine upon his return from Atlanta, GA recently. GA is on NY's ""DO NOT ENTER OUR STATE LIST"" and if you do, then you must quarantine or face fines. Hope this helps."
My hospital requires people who travel out of state to get test on return and work from home till test back and to get second test a week later. International travel mandatory 10 day quarantine.Hospitals can require more strict rules than states
This is probably not the best forum to ask about what the requirements are in NC. I would see what they are requiring per a government page.But no one can predict what the rules might be in late October.
"1 agree with Joan that it is recommendation and not a requirement by the CDC. And would also follow Marks advice and research North Carolina's regulation on this.Edited: 7:35 am, July 23, 2020 "
"OP's own first sentence......""NC requires a 14 day quarantine upon return from international travel."""
"Sorry CDC ""recommends"" but NC ""requires"".Could you fired for not quarantining?Is their a fine?What if you get it because you went and are asymptomatic and pass it to someone because you did not follow the rules."
