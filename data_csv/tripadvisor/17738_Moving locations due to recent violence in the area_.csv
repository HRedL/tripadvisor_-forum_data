"Just wondering if anyone has talked to their airline or tour company (e.g. Orbitz, Travelocity) about moving locations due to the recent violence in the Area? I probably won't be switching our upcoming trip but interested in looking at options."
I'm interested in this too. We're supposed to be coming in 3 weeks from now. Im going to see how the situation progresses in the next week or so before I decide to change locations. Do these tour companies make it difficult if you want to change your trip to somewhere else(Dominican for example)?
"No, will still go to Playacar with my family. This stuff happens everywhere. Freaking out helps nobody."
"These outfits will work with you; for a price. IMHO; Before you think the DR is safer than Playa del Carmen or Mexico, in general, think again. You might want to visit the forums in the DR section."
"The good news is that there is a decent likelihood that things will calm down. Somebody posted that Westjet was willing to re-book for a $75 change fee. I think the problem you are going to find is that until and unless there is an official travel warning, there won't be much you can do outside of the normal change policies."
Dominican Republic?...Really....Makes Mexico look like Disney World..https:/……about.com/od/dominicanrepublic/a/Crime-And-…
"Relax take a breath everyone.Bad things happen everywhere, don't let it stop you from living and enjoying life. Will be in Playa in two weeks and no more worried about going there this time than any of the last 7 or 8 times. common sense people..."

Go further southPuerto Aventuras (gated community)AkumalTulum
"Try Isla Mujeres, Islands are always safe and low crime. *No way for the bag guys to get away. Plus they have a heavily armed Navy Base on the island, not a very Cartel friendly placetensions have been very high lately in Akumal and Tulum has had a few events in the last couple years that have affected a lot of tourist. They are generally safe from the drug violence. PA is a nice little community. Like mentioned above DR has its share of Crime.One of the alternatives to Mexico we found and love is Fiji, only down side is a long flight but so beautiful and safe, you would be amazed how affordable it is. Just the flight is long 11 hours form LA. (it is over night so you can sleep most of the way)."
"You forgot Cozumel.....We haven't experienced any issues. Just concerned about our friends on the Mainland. We also have a very large Military Base here, plus the Ferries are very closely monitored. Not saying we do not have crime like any city. But we are mostly a quiet Dive and Snorkeling community."
This is the first year we have booked Cozumel... normally go to PDL or south of there. So happy we went with Cozumel and looking forward to some great snorkeling!! :)
As long as you don't hang around where drugs are sold/consumed you have almost no chance of being caught up in drug related violence.
"cpbea So in other words stay away from 5th ave, the beach and Beach clubs"
Just stay away from stray bullets! really? LOL!
"Alot of the violence is because of bpm. Bpm has often brought violence. The violence should diminish and will be forgotten. I would have no issue roaming playa in the day. I will likely stay on the resort at night, but I do that anyway.Remember in the Dominican you don't even wanna leave the resort. So you might as well do the same in mexico"
Why even go if you cannot explore?
"Just booked Thompson Beach House for July. I feel like I should be more worried, but I still want to keep the reservation. Am I being naive? Do we need to be concerned about walking freely at night?"
If only people that visit here would not purchase the product that these thugs are pushing. You would see a lot less violence. Buts that's a tall order to depend on.Edited: 3 years ago 
Sadly many tourists go just for that reason! It is not like the tourist areas do not push massive partying though! You want it you will get it!
Nope.....I'll be there in just a few short days.
"Chris K : ""You would see a lot less violence""As compared to what? 2nd person from Cozumel acting like there is some sort of outbreak or pattern of violence in Playa. I already asked one to provide examples and got silence. I am starting to think that the Cozumel folk posting on this thread might have an agenda."

well said. We go the 9th-15th and theres zero chance we would ever change it. Living in Fear is no way to live.
"The reality is you have more of a chance to he hurt or killed by a drunk Mexican driver or hit by a taxi, now that is an epidemic threat to tourist, far more then getting shot or blown up by the cartel.Oh I need to add whiplash from the Speedbumps (Topes)Edited: 3 years ago "
"Travelocity will not let you change your plans (without a fee). No different than trying to change your vacation to Miami, Los Angeles etc because there was a gang related incident. Calm down people. Welcome to the world."
I've been to the DR and besides being boring I would rather take my chances in PDC cartel or no cartel
"I love that some people replying live in Chicago and there have been more shootings there in the last 2 years than anywhere in the United States. Violence happens everywhere, even in hippy Asheville where I live. Nightclub shootings are not predictable and it really freaking sucks that people suffered that way. It is not the norm, and happens everywhere."
Coconut Crazy .... right on!!!!
You cannot even compare the violence in the US compared to Mexican Cartels. They make gangs here look like choirboys! Plus with the rampant corruption of the Mexican government and police how can you even feel protected in some cases?
"If you probably won't be changing your upcoming trip why would you be interested in looking at options? If you've actually read what happened and why, at least with the facts so far, and have a desire to change your travel plans by all means do so. But you need to talk to your agent about change fees.The rhetoric from this thread and comparisons to other areas aren't helpful to anyone planning a visit to the Playa area, at least IMHO. We'll be there for a few weeks and over Carnival, and would never consider changing our plans based on this event."
we are going first week in June did not even cross my mind to cancel these things can happen anyplace
The DR is a ghetto in comparison!!! I agree 100%
"Oh, we are going in 4 weeks to Playacar and can't wait. There more crime in Toronto than PDC."
"The way I see it, this stuff happens in every country and city. It just depends where the newspapers and news agency's like to focus on in that particular week. I remeber a time when my city was reportedly the gun capital of the united kingdom, I've never seen a gun in my life, or known anyone get shot. So take from that what you will. MattPs were traveling out on the 30th Jan, not worried in the slightest and traveling with our 1 year old baby."
"Everyone here is discussing only based on what they know from this one incident, remember the Mayor and other Gov officials tried to cover this up as a upset patron, it is what you do not know that is the concern these days, meaning what is covered up, what the local media is afraid to print, this is the problem with Cartel areas.The question is would you take your kids to a place that had known violent crime or significant drug crime. This is not like visiting Chicago or Orlando, this relates to a Crime organization that is operating within and targeting the tourist community you might be taking your kids to. If this was happening at Disney World would you go or take your kids to Disney world?"
"Must safer than at home in my eyes. Especially now this has happened, security will have been increased.Never felt worried out of the resort in Mexico or in DR.Common sense prevails."
"LOL...There is really no need to share your particular views with Matt, not everyone agrees with your ""assessment"" whether right or wrong. If things change we'll all reevaluate our choices based on that information. We are also going down in a few weeks for our 7th visit in 18 months to see our friends and our new home. The continuing rhetoric and misinformation here and in the other threads is really more harmful than helpful to anyone trying to make an informed decision - Give it a rest (that won't happen...)"

"This is a bit worrisome as we are booked in for first week of march at a resort north of PDC but I don't think we will change our plans unless things really escalate. I may choose to stay on the resort the entire time and decide to not visit the town since I have seen it before but like others have said...violence is everywhere, can't let that stop you from living."
