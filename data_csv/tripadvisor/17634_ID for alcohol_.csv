"Just a quick question, will a provisional UK driving license be accepted as ID for purchasing alcohol? Just don't want to be taking my passport out with me every night.Thanks"
It all depends on the person you deal with - some will accept a photo driving licence whilst others will only accept a passport.
"Many people working in Vegas don't know what a provisional UK license looks like so if they have any doubts at all they will be cautious and refuse it.As stated in answer #1 it all depends on who is serving you.You will have the same issue with a full driving license, the only ID that is guaranteed to be accepted is a passport..If you are just wandering from place to place it is fine because if you get refused at one place you can just move on somewhere else, but if you are making specific plans to go to a certain place then you should take a passport to avoid disappointment."
I find it funny that we accept a out-of-country drivers license in law enforcement on a stop but to get a drink from the bar they might need their passport depending on the person. Kinda sounds like additional training for servers is needed.
"I still don't understand this nearly universal fear of carrying one's passport. The USA has plenty of crime, but very little of it involves pickpockets nor passport theft."
"""we accept a out-of-country drivers license in law enforcement""Officers are trained in the various formats of temporary, provisional, replacement, permanent, etc drivers licenses from every country? I did not know that.I do know that if I was running a busy nightclub and some kid shows up with a crumpled piece of paper and claims it's a provisional drivers license from his home Provence of someplace-or-other that I might be inclined to take the safe (for me) approach and not accept it..."
"Even, I would guess it more of a case of fear of losing it in a state of drunkeness rather than theft, especially in Las VegasFor what it is worth, I have been refused service in the UK with my British provisional licence, go figure that! You are always at the mercy of the server you interact with"
"The risk of losing a passport is small. Just like the risk of losing your wallet or cell phone or other belongings. (Although I do have a nephew who seems to lose his phone every 69 days, but Ai digress...)It's the process of replacing the passport that gives people concern. Lose your driver's license and you're still getting on a plane back to Tennessee where you get a new one. Lose your passport and you're not getting on your flight back home. And you're going to Los Angele, or possibly further, to get a replacement. Potentially thousands of dollars in airfare costs and days of delays in getting home. I totally understand why people don't want to carry one around, especially if they're out partying."
"'I still don't understand this nearly universal fear of carrying one's passport. The USA has plenty of crime, but very little of it involves pickpockets nor passport theft.'It's an epidemic phobia amongst our friends across the pond."
">> It's an epidemic phobia amongst our friends across the pond. <<Agreed. Most countries I've visited, including those in Europe, require visitors to carry their passports at all times. So I do. And I don't give it a second thought. Yep, if I lose it, I'm in a world of hurt. But I'm far more likely to be asked to produce it for the gendarmes (or my hotel clerk!) than I am to lose it.Shouldn't be so different in Las Vegas than the capitals of Europe. After all, one does come to LV to gamble!Edited: 4 years ago "
And law enforcement may have much more latitude in whom they cite etc.Vegas casinos are multi-billion dollar enterprises that have zero latitude for a server's mistake that could cost them significant troubles. Why should they? Better to be safe than sorry etc.
