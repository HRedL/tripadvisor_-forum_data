"My wife and I have booked a trip to Alaska for the 1st week of August. It is going to be a land first and cruise 2nd for a total of about 11 days. I have not contacted Holland cruise lines for their input yet. We live in Florida. What are the airlines, Alaska trip, and Cruise lines advising at this point. Wayne"
"Ummm, there are some valuable resources available to you. The internet and telephone are 2 I can think of just off the top. You might want to a bit of research to find the answers to your questions. But while I am thinking of it. I may visit Florida someday. Can you research some hotels, rental cars and attractions I may or may not be interested in? Thanks for the help!"
"https:/…coronavirus-travel-advisory.htmlEDIT: Actually, Holland America doesn't WANT people to phone. They simply won't have an answer at this time.Edited: 12:57 pm, April 05, 2020 "
So Nancy N has 2 posts...wonder if the first post was as helpful as the second one. Wow. Thanks Maple for helping the OP...you are always helpful...
FYIthe one way cruises are usually to Vancouver. the Canada/US border might not be open to leisure travel by then. So best to keep checking the Border Service web sites for information that keeps changing. https:/…canadas-reponse.htmlFYI there is a post on the Vancouver forum by a poster that works at the cruise ship terminal. He said there is no way he is going back to work there this year even if they reopen.
"Way too difficult to help you plan travel to my lifelong home now. We are in quarantine, until the end of the month, with the understanding that is subject to change. Just because cruise ships and trains and whatever say they are “open for business“ on July 1st, doesn’t really mean anything, until we get closer to May and June, and see how Alaska has fared, with this virus. See what businesses will be open or closed even. No one has those answers now. Period. This next week has been projected to be the toughest, according to our state leaders and national medical experts. None of my friends or family are currently planning trips to anywhere outside of Alaska, and we’re very aware our recreational outdoor activity needs to be “in our area”. IOW....going to the family cabin at Willow, is not really suggested, if one is traveling from Anchorage, and many people have different interpretations of the “stay put, but have fun outside” suggestion. So crazy to me you want to know how our world will look like in August, cause who knows? We’re intensely involved in trying to stop the spread, flatten the curve, keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed. What will our state look like after this is over? Who knows? No crystal ball, but I knew since mid February this virus was going to be a very big problem. I’m a 60 year old asthmatic, with two elders also in quarantine, with our youngest sister. We were paying close attention to this, because our health depended on it, and our parent’s health. How’s Florida doing? Is that where you are from? Your beaches were busy during spring break, while many of our school districts cancelled school sponsored spring break trips. I expect your home may be having some troubles ahead, like everywhere soon.....if we do not stay home, until further notice. This is how many Alaskans feel, but would never come onto a forum like this one, and say so. Not meant to be unfriendly, just honest about what is currently happening. Your tourist business, is not as important as our lives. Alaska only has so many hospitals, medical staff and supplies, and while you’re hoping for help, with a vacation several months away, too tough to help you, having no idea if we will be done with what is currently happening. My suggestion is to dream about next year, and feel fortunate if you’re in that position. Jmho. Take care, hunker down, cause that is what Alaska is doing now. None of this was meant with ANY ill will, just the honest truth. Deb"
"P.S. This does affect our lives, because we paid in full, except flights, for an amazing Disneyland, five nights, in November vacation. I will not go, and will consider it a miracle, if my husband goes with our 30 year old son. I can’t be in crowds or near others, until a vaccine is available. Bummer, but my asthma has almost killed me before. Deadly serious. Usually we road too Fairbanks this week, every year for several now, but not this year, and no plans on the calendar yet. This virus is grounding us too, and it’s sad, cause I miss my kids. Plan a beautiful trip for next year, when life will be hopefully, less chaotic. Deb"
"Ok, let's all calm down a bit. Maybe take a time out. In these stressful times our nerves can be a bit on edge. Now, I fully understand how one might be tempted to react upon learning the OP (Wayne W) has not even contacted the cruise line he booked with to get their advice. It would be natural to respond with something like, ""Why don't you get off your ample duff and contact your cruise line and your planned airline and get their advice directly?"" But I would encourage folks to avoid this kind of understandable reaction if at all possible. Let me explain why. You see, if you read between the lines of what Wayne W is saying in his original post, you start to see that here is someone who has quite a bit of anxiety about this upcoming trip and is reaching out for help. He is a bit beside himself and doesn't know which way to turn. The paralysis he feels is preventing him from even contacting his already booked cruise line to seek advice. He is wracked with emotional torment. So rather than respond in a rash way, I will attempt to help as best I am able. I see the OP is seeking what current advice is being given by 3 different entities (and quoting directly from the original post): 1) ""airlines"" 2) ""Alaska trip"", and 3) ""cruise lines"". Now, right off, we all know exactly what those 3 entities are so I decided to dive right in and see what kind of answer I could come up with to avert any trauma for the OP. So I have worked all day on item number 2...Alaska trip. I contacted many high ranking officials at Alaska trip and, unfortunately, I was getting conflicting responses. Knowing the dire straits the OP was in I knew I had to cut through the confusion and get to the bottom of things. I ultimately was able to contact the CEO of Alaska trip. I'm happy to report that after the CEO huddled with the appropriate folks within Alaska trip, I now have a definitive answer for the OP. Alaska trip's CEO had this sage advice. At this time he advised the best course was to, and I quote directly, ""proceed with extreme caution"". So there you have it straight from the horses mouth. I do hope that my humble efforts to get a definitive answer for the OP on at least that portion of his question can set his mind at ease. Unfortunately, after spending all day researching the answer to the Alaska trip portion of the question, I was unable to make progress on the other items in the inquiry. Namely, airlines and cruise lines. So, at this point, if I may I would just offer this to the OP. Why don't you get off your ample duff and contact your cruise line and your planned airline and get their advice directly?"
I'm from Florida and we are at home at least until April 30th. I had a wonderful land trip booked for June 2020 to Alaska. Had to cancel it all. But I will come June 2021 ! Make sure and check cancellation policies. Everyone I booked with was very fair to me except so far the airlines. Stay safe everyone
"Wayne, I'm sorry that a brand-new member such as yourself has had such unpleasant responses on your very first post. Normally this forum is quite friendly. I can only attribute it to the upset and worry caused by the serious health and financial issues facing our world right now. Up to you, but I suggest waiting until the first week of July to contact HAL, assuming you haven't heard from them before then (which I expect you will). From your post it sounds as if you're doing a cruise tour, so HAL would be handling everything except possibly air fare? For the latter, see this recent post: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g28923-…I know it's frustrating not knowing if your trip will go ahead as planned, but all we can do is keep our fingers crossed that things will be much better soon."
"Anytime I make a rare comment, understand my words are meant for ANYONE planning a 2020 summer season vacation to Alaska. There is no way to know what kind of tourist season we will have, who will be open, etc.......sooooo, for those that need to be planning a vacation up here or anywhere, a wise choice might be for 2021, and that’s tough to say, because no one wants to wait for their fun. Not in today’s world. Me included, yet, that’s life right now. This OP was a one post member. I never think one post members are “for real”, but the post afforded me an opportunity to share how I feel right now, about visitors trying to plan Alaska fun, for this summer. I stayed quiet for eleven days, and decided to share my opinion. Why not? We’ve lived here for almost 58 years, and have family all over Alaska, so the subject matters to me. Too much up in the air right now, to be vacation planning for summer 2020, unless you’re willing to quarantine for two weeks, right off the get go, then have your vacation. Not sure how long that will be in play. Be super flexible about your plans, but that can be tough to do in Alaska, for those that don’t live here, or have experience traveling here. (If Wayne is not a troll, my apologies for thinking you might be. Just how I view most one post posts.) Deb"
"Wow, not to be a jerk, but this post is almost entertaining. We are in trying times to say the least and I for one, very sadly, cancelled our first trip to Alaska which was coming up pretty soon but with the Denali rockslide and Canada not letting us through (side trip to Vancouver) and the trains not running soon, we felt it best to try again for 2021. Please lets just all try to help one another out. Yes, there are posts where you think "" Really, you didn't bother to try to ask anyone at the Airline, Hotel, Tour Company, cruise line, whatever???"" but as veteran TA ers we are needed by the people who are just plain confused, have maybe never contacted TA before, maybe even are just plain lazy, but lets take the High Road and support each other."
"Hey All, I have had conversations with several locals who are involved in the ""Tourist arena"". Most expect they will cancel or have already canceled, May, June, July. Some hope for August. I know some show open etc.... But, lets be realistic. Anyone of us can see the timelines for outbreaks and how long a process this is..... By most accounts this started in Dec. Do you know of ANY place that has had a large scale outbreak in the last 4 months that has a tourist life now? I do not either....I commend what a poster put up earlier on Canada rules and regs. IMO, needed here. Wayne, I also want to say I am sorry for what I consider rudeness. THIS is where you come when you want advice from people who have exp. in Alaska and the challenges it involves. THIS IS A TIME TO PLAN. You do not have to have dates. Just a general time frame. Ask questions on here!As for calming down.... boy oh boy.... So much I would like to ......Suffice to say, Deb, has a passion for my home like a lot of people. I share that passion. It comes thru the way we communicate and the way we live our life. You do not like that passion.... do not read. She also as a resident contributes greatly to the forum.Calm down my... Dude, You have NO idea. Search Spanish Flu Alaska. https:/… If anyone of you would care too do some fun research.... go to local FB goups in Homer, Seward and other vacation destinations. The posters explain how a lot of us feel. Best... BoatAk"
"As an example of how business is faring, I got an email from Ravin Air which has grounded all its flights and laid off all employees until further notice. Filing for chapter 11 hoping to obtain financial assistance to reopen. I sincerely hope this will pass soon, with as few as possible affected. Stay home and stay healthy for now."
There is a place where tourism is starting again. It will be interesting to see what happens in China in the next few weeks. https:/…index.html
"I want to thank the responders to this post for helping me come to grips with the logical decision to cancel our long-planned trip in early July. We would be traveling on our own, but we did book a customized package thru an Alaska agency for the first part of the trip, taking the train from Anchorage to Denali, then on to Fairbanks to pick up a car for the remainder of the trip.We were already concerned about whether the road in Denali would really be open and had also changed plans for lack of confidence that the Marine Ferry would be running from Valdez to Whittier, so this really nailed it for us. Regardless of the time we spent planning this trip in detail, I'm in my 70s and the only thing worse than getting seriously ill with this virus would be getting ill in a place that's so remote for us (we have better access to Europe than to Alaska!).We have to cancel our package soon to have only a 10% cost penalty; our other reservations are cancellable and we'll have to see what the airline is doing by then. But we still have our copy of The Milepost handy and will hang onto our itinerary for future use.P.S. Would anyone really get onto a cruise ship yet this year, let alone in July??"
"Regarding Post #14.... When I read the piece at 330 am I had to laugh. Good timing! lol.  Couple of points.... A holiday weekend.... does not make a summer here in Alaska. 2 weeks or so ago, Forbes had an article on tourism opening up in China. Talked some about the Shanghai tourist area as an example. Then it (Shanghai) closed for 10 days.""According to the paper, Huangshan has since announced it will stop receiving tourists""Our tourism is not at all the same. It is a little harder to open and close Alaska. Last point.... Anyone on this forum feel comfortable going to Wuhan for a vacation right now? Best.... BoatAk."
"Everyone here, at one point in time, had 1 post."
"There's nothing wrong with planning as long as you know it may not happen and include that in your plans. I have a June land-only trip planned. Do I think it will happen? No. But I haven't canceled either. None of us knows how this thing will go. Maybe the trip will work out and the virus dies a sudden death and isn't a danger and we get to go. Maybe the state of Alaska will say no to tourists or tourists from certain areas. Maybe the planes won't be flying other than for emergencies and essential business at that time. Maybe everything will be open. Maybe everything will be closed. Who knows?! So plan knowing it may or may not happen and listen to the advice of national officials, Alaska officials, and your home state and region officials as your date gets closer. None of us want to put anyone in harm's way. We just have to be patient."
"Keep this friendly. I agree that this forum is usually the best. Let’s keep it that way! Life is lockdown everywhere. We are all mentally getting to grips with this and what it means. Here in France, when all this started, the summer felt so far away. Now the weeks of lockdown are flying by and I am starting to get to grips with the idea that the July trip I have planned to Alaska is getting close very quickly and will probably not happen. But I still can’t bring myself to cancel yet. Just in case the miracle happens.... We’ll all get to grips with a new reality soon and in most cases the decision will be taken for us. Just give us time. And then let’s get planning for 2021!"
"I find the Alaska forum quite different from other forums on TA. On most forums the vast majority of people have done their homework to a good degree and come to the forum to ask specific questions to put the finishing touches on their trip. If someone posts a question and it is quite obvious they have not even lifted a finger to do 30 seconds of research, the board members will totally ignore them, as they rightfully should. It's quite different on this forum. On this forum, even when it is quite obvious that someone is too lazy to even do a hint of their own research, they will ask a question and people will race to be the first one to offer up pages of advice. I wonder how many first post people on this forum are just posting gag posts just to see people jump through hoops to answer their silly made up questions and get a good laugh. Someone could post something like, Oh, I booked a trip to Alaska for this summer. Is there anything to do in Alaska? Do they have any hotels in Alaska? Is a person able to rent a car in Alaska? Will I be able to find food anywhere in Alaska? You'd have people falling all over each other offering pages of advice. It's laughable but also kind of sad."
"It appears to me that there IS someone on this forum posting ""gag posts"", but it's not the OP.The regulars here realize that Alaska is one of the most challenging places to arrange a vacation, so are usually a bit more forgiving of posters who seem overwhelmed. We don't have much patience with utterly useless trolls, though."
Sometimes the truth hurts.
It's your own fault if your feelings were hurt.
"Our forum has been getting significantly more “vague, one post“ posts, for the past 4-5 months, wanting lots of info, while giving us very little info in return. My high post count doesn’t come from helping on the AK forum, but from another state, where wacky stuff happened all the time. It taught me to pay attention. While I view first post posts skeptically, I still reply, if I think the information I share could be useful. Below is an example where I’m glad I did, and Fizzy proved to be “for real”, and our exchange was helpful. Not negative. I’ve already apologized to this OP, who has chosen not to post again, for whatever their reasons are, if I read him wrong. My apology is sincere. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60826…For those still hoping their trips can happen, I hope the same for you. For many of us, “the compromised”, travel will not happen again, until a vaccine is available. That is just “my” reality, and I’m ok with it. That’s life, even tho it’s crazy. Thankful I’m Alaskan, cause this is where my best vacations are anyways. DebEdited: 12:54 pm, April 07, 2020 "
