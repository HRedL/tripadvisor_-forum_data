from live animal markets
HiNo dumb ass they have been eating snakes for ever. maybe from eating wild animals no one knows.
"Can eat anything, almost, as long as it's cooked properly"
"Quote: Epidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017, said Zhong, adding that the 2019-nCoV probably has an intermediate host that may be a certain kind of wild animal."
Nah. Thatâ€™s just a rumour. Snakes can slither faster than humans can run to catch them. That is why so few of them end up in the cooking pot.
"There are other viruses out there in animals which are going unnoticed Give it time and after several mutations the virus will finally jump to those at the top of the food chain via other speciesWe give them every opportunity to do that in livestock marketsSARS, MERS, EBOLA, spread from animals to us via different ways and now CORONAVIRUS which looks likely the same type of story @ POST 4 most species / members of the wildlife community can out move humans thats why we come in second now and again when we get to close, but we have ways and means of overcoming that when we are hungry Ha Ha HaHappy Travels"
