"Hi,I am wanting to know if the state of Michigan is still under lock down. If so, does anyone know if and when it may reopen?"
The state is in different stages of opening. Bars and restaurants can serve dine in under some restrictions. Retail is also open under some restrictions. If something specific you are wondering about ask and likely someone here will know.

"It’s not “normal operations” here, as it should not be. We’ve had 60,000+ cases of COVID19, much these in the southeast region but quite a bit near Grand Rapids as well. I’m in healthcare so I totally understand and respect the graduated restrictions. If you eat in a restaurant, half of the booths and tables are blocked off. Curbside pickup and takeout is big now. Masks are required in southeast Michigan if you go into a store or restaurant. Staff is also limited so everything takes longer- checking out in stores, getting your food at a restaurant. Things may be different up north and I am speaking about southeast Michigan. There seems to be a lack of consistency. Recently called a campground/RV park. They were open but their pool was closed. Bottom line, use caution, call ahead and stay home if you’re sick. We really don’t want to go through another March/April here in the mitten state. Those of us in healthcare are tired."
