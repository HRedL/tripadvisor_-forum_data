"I'm concerned with the lack of awareness, and the lack of advice on possible Malaria contamination of tourist in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. There has been 14 confirmed cases of Malaria in puertorricans vacationing in Punta Cana during the last two weeks. That's close to 3 times the cases we normally have per year. These 14 individuals were on separate places in Punta Cana.The Malaria is transmitted by a mosquito bite. We have not seen any response from the Dominican Health Authorities.I personally would not travel to that region, and I try to share the problem with as many people I know; but people should be alerted and have them make the decision. Puerto Rico Health Department have alerted that pregnant woman and kids, should not travel to Punta Cana, and the others to visit their physicians first, to star a preventive therapy prior to travel.There is no cure for Malaria. Hope someone alert your followers."

"Of course there's cures for malaria, Medicines and tablets, what your prescribed will depend on the type you have,"
"Maleria can be cured. However, it is much better to take anti-malerial drugs to prevent infection. These are common and the type recommended for DR are quite cheap in UK."
Luis RUK visitors are made aware of the possibility of contracting Malaria when visiting the Dominican Republic. A link is provided here......tripadvisor.com/Travel-g147293-c80058/Punta-…Perhaps everyone and not just UK visitors should read it !
The Malaria prophylaxis normally recommended for the Dominican Republic by UK doctors and UK practice nurses is Avloclor (Chloroquine Phosphate) 250mg Anti-Malaria Tablets. They are available without prescription from most UK high street pharmacies such as Boots and Lloyds. You can also walk into supermarket pharmacies such as ASDA and Sainsbury's and purchase them. They will always confirm to which country you are going before dispensing them. They are also available online.
Epidemic?You yell FIRE in a crowded theater much?
That's why I drink at least one Gin & Tonic per day...!

"From the CDC website:Quote:Areas with malaria: All areas (including resort areas), except none in the cities of Santiago and Santo Domingo. Estimated relative risk of malaria for US travelers: Low. Drug resistance4: None. Malaria species: P. falciparum 100% Recommended chemoprophylaxis: Atovaquone-proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine. The recommendations for malaria prevention include estimates of malaria risk to US travelers. These estimates are based on numbers of malaria cases reported in US travelers and the estimated volume of travel to these countries. In some instances, the risk may be low because the actual intensity of transmission is low in that country. In other instances, malaria transmission may occur only in small focal areas of the country where US travelers seldom go. UnquoteSo unless you plan on doing some extensive touring of the jungle/forest/far in-land areas, your risk is low. Use the good repellents in any case."
"I read that the 14 young Puerto Rican Students did NOT leave the resort or enter any jungles or forests. I don't take meds for malaria when I travel to this island. I am not recommending them or discouraging them. Those decisions are best made with ones private practitioner. However, we need to stop minimizing the disease and accept that it is present and even if one case is reported in the area in which one will travel, it is still a risk. Travelers need to make an assessment of their personal health history and decide, with professionals, if they wish to arm themselves. That is best done with allowing accurate and factual information to be reported on travel forums, blogs, notices and reputable centers as the CDC. Trying to distort facts with personal opinions that are really not relevant to this particular issue is counterproductive and not helpful to others.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I think it was 3 teenagers, 15 to 20 years old, on a graduation trip.Can't find much on any other recent cases around the Caribbean. Seems like there is more news about spitting armadillos causing leprosy.The CDC has more stricter warnings about hepatitis A and typhoid than malaria. So let's not over-hype the issue."
Jada6_Absolutely correct and well said. Too many people coming on here saying the risk is low so no need to take the medication. This is very poor advice. Any person coming here should seek advice from their medical practitioner.
"Just goggle it, there are no vaccines, only treatment of symptoms, and you could develop immunity after suffering it.."
"They are not only young kids, only three of them were seniors in a school trip. There are people from 17 to 60's involved and they were not in the same Hotel, but all of them in Punta Cana."
"According to the CDC: ""Malaria can be cured with prescription drugs. The type of drugs and length of treatment depend on the type of malaria, where the person was infected, their age, whether they are pregnant, and how sick they are at the start of treatment.""http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/faqs.htmlWhere are the links to the cases other than the 3 students?Mark"
"Jada - I don't think one person labelling this an 'epidemic' is not accurate nor factual information. The fact is -An epidemic is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less. When you consider the number of people going through Punta Cana in a 2 week period 14 cases is not a large number of the population. Is this something that people should be aware of - sure, but wrongly labeling it does not help the situation.Edited: 5 years ago "
"@#16 elnuevodia.com/noticias/…@#17 You will have to take up your issue with ""but wrongly labeling it does not help the situation"" with the OP. As has already been expressed, we are not all perfect in how we start a topic, but I applaud the OP for doing so, to the best of their ability. Again, it's hurtful to the travel community to try and mask facts because of our own fears and lack of knowledge about something so potentially dangerous. Info provided here on TA as well as other reputable sites help travelers take current info back to their practitioners to make informed decisions."
"Many things are low risk - lost luggage, flight delays, being injured whilst on holiday, etc but many people take out travel insurance and / or make sure they have cover in place just in caseAgain it is personal choice"
Oh I agree with you 100 % Jada - some posters are able to word anything to suit their purposes! And they do so on any and every subject.

"PJR wrote: The choice of words in the heading is very unfortunate.

NOT AN EPIDEMIC!!!! NOT!! It's incorrectly worded like that for a reason, namely to alarm and upset people, why not call them out on it especially since the rest of the information is hyperbolic at best, and basically just WRONG. To say there is no cure, what a crock! An outright LIE. There is prevention, treatment, and cure for this disease, IF one would happen to be so unlucky. Which a few have been."
"jada6 was right on this part: ""Those decisions are best made with ones private practitioner."" .... and certainly with these lines: ""That is best done with allowing accurate and factual information to be reported on travel forums, blogs, notices and reputable centers as the CDC. Trying to distort facts with personal opinions that are really not relevant to this particular issue is counterproductive and not helpful to others.""Which is why I agree that saying there is NO CURE AND CALLING A FEW CASES AN EPIDEMIC is not accurate nor factual, it is distorting facts, and serves no useful purpose. And should be pointed out to the other readers, as I and others have done. You're very welcome. :)"
"From CDC: Country Dominican RepublicAreas with Malaria All areas (including resort areas), except none in the cities of Santiago and Santo DomingoEstimated relative risk of Malaria for US Travelers -- Low Key Information Needed and Helpful Links to Assess Need for Prophylaxis for Select Countries-- City(ies) of travelSeveral medications are available for chemoprophylaxis. When deciding which drug to use, consider specific itinerary, length of trip, cost of drug, previous adverse reactions to antimalarials, drug allergies, and current medical history. All travelers should seek medical attention in the event of fever during or after return from travel to areas with malaria.This risk estimate is based largely on cases occurring in US military personnel who travel for extended periods of time with unique itineraries that likely do not reflect the risk for the average US traveler. last updated: May 26, 2015Content source: Global Health - Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria"
"As one can see some people and the replies given are over dramatic on this subject. If the press reports:elnuevodia.com/noticias/…from Puerto Rico are correct and there is no reason to doubt them, it is best to bring the contents to the attention of your physician/doctor/nurse when making arrangements to come to the Dominican Republic. This is the reason for posting the following information for UK visitors:tripadvisor.com/Travel-g147293-c80058/Punta-…Edited: 5 years ago "
"PJR... I certainly agree with you that calling it an epidemic and saying there is no cure is ""over dramatic on this subject."" It's also just INCORRECT. :)"
"I think that all the ""rants & raves"" only serve to distract from the real issue. It seems to be easier to pick out what's wrong with the conversation rather than what's right. Sadly, it can only hurt future travelers. For me, as a traveler, I like to weigh an issue and see which way it balances on the scale (personally). In this particular case, if travelers believe the word ""epidemic"" (which we know has been used incorrectly) and they become frightened and cancel their plans without exploring the issue further, there will really be no harm done (to them physically). With the exception of them missing out on that beautiful beach :-) If they believe all of this is nonsense, they then travel with a risk (as small as it will be), especially if a traveler has a medical history that is compromised. We can sit around and debate this all day, pick apart the words that were used and even shout out at the forum with capital letters. It won't change the facts, which are that there has been 14 confirmed cases of Malaria in travelers that vacationed in Punta Cana during the last two weeks. They were said to have not left the resort. Information about the reliability of the contraction has been posted, several times. The beauty of a travel forum, blog or group is that we can decide for ourselves what is worth our time and energy or attention and what is not. It's all good!"
Wow this is the first time I read about this. 14 confirmed cases is nothing to shrug off. I will continue to watch this topic. Great post # 30!
"Oddly though...and not questioning this really....BUT...only Puerto Ricans. I find that a wee bit odd and isolated. As an island vying for tourist dollars and a direct neighbour, could it be???? Naw...I am thinking too hard.businessinsider.com/r-puerto-rico-tourism-in…"
Must admit I was wondering the same as you Mike how it is that only 14 students from PR have contracted the virus given how many tourists were staying in the area. I hope they make a speedy recovery though.It's our first time to the DR and have bought the anti malarials along with repellent not worth the risk.
It wasn't 14 but 3 students from PR.
14??? All news reports say THREE students. 3More hyperbole?or what?
"The risk of Malaria in DR especially on resorts in Punta Caña is Low. No one even mentions easy preventative measures like avoiding being outside at dusk to dawn. Wearing loose long sleeves cover yourself if you are getting bites. Carry a high deet bug spray in your pocket like Ben's available at Walmart for $5, I did and didn't even see Mosquitos in 7 days, so NEVER sprayed it on me. Palladium resorts fogged for mosquitos in late evening. Yes I took anti-malarial prophylaxis daily during my late June visit. I mainly was concerned that the mosquito population would be large and active in D.R. like it is in my yard in N. Illinois. But the differences in rainfall make the difference. I sat outside at dusk and beyond each evening without even getting bothered at all. Stay away from stagnet fresh water, don't walk in grassy areas, where mosquitos will be stirred up. Etc. use suitable precautions. If mosquitos were very prevatent, how could staff stand and serve at outside bars all evening till midnight every day and groundskeepers not pump malaria numbers up from beyond Low risk? The risk is low, go inside at night if there is some bug problems. Use effective bug spray if mosquitos are seen. Use common sense, you want to enjoy vacation safely."
In the newspapers from Puerto Rico (in Spanish) it emphatically lists 14 as infected or suspected of infection. I posted the Link previously. It isn't just 3!
Lammerspeil and LaTA3 read the newspaper report below. It says 14 not 3.elnuevodia.com/noticias/…Let the article open in Spanish and then let google translate to English. There is no mistake.
It does amaze me how some well meaning people are still trying to downplay this or come up with some off the wall conspiracy theoriesAll people can do is to look at the hard facts that have been presented and should be available to your medical practitioner and make their own judgement call - it is still low risk BUT!!!
"Well said Jada, and PC Mike, that same thought crossed my mind also.  I did a quick look into my reference data sets and it would appear that Puerto Rico has not declared any 'home grown' cases of malaria. Given it's geographical location, one could imagine that it is not a stretch that one would find a few mosquitoes capable of transmission. Going to dig a little more to see exactly how cases are classed and counted in PR, and if it is a 'reportable' A quick look on their Departamento de Salud site will go a little smoother once I put my spanish reading glasses on :-)As always, the decision to prophylaxis or not to prophylaxis is one best made between the individual and their primary care practitioner.Safe and healthy travelsBugs"
Great advice and info as always Bugs.

"Thanks for all the updates. We are considering going back to either Mexico or Punta Cana this winter. Between all the seaweed and now this, we may just stay home."
"""Between all the seaweed and now this, we may just stay home.""Unlike seaweed you can take preventative steps against malaria!!"
Because there is preventative medication for Malaria and has been for a very long time this is a non-issue. Its unfortunate there have been reported cases but self-responsibility is the issue not the fact that there is a minute possibility of contracting the disease. None if you medicate. Frankly I'm surprised TA hasn't shut this one down.
We just got back from punta cana and my husband has became a very sick man. The mosquitoes were so terrible down by the beach up by the resort they brought in a professional to spray.. trying to get him to go to the hospital..Great time but don't forget your bug spray. Praying its nothing to bad!!
It was so bad we were all told to put liquid soap on. All the staff outside were putting it on also. Them mosquitoes were tough son of a guns. Nothing was keeping them from biting but the liquid soap. Crazy!!
