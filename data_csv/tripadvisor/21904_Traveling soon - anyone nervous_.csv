"Reading all the coronavirus news reports and admittedly it’s tough not to be a bit nervous about traveling in general. Coming from Toronto, staying at Colonial Club for one week."
Traveling soon- not nervous. Will just wash my hands and certain surfaces like I normally would.
Not worried.
"We leave for GC in 9 days. I understand where you are coming from & I get a little nervous if I watch too much of the news myself. I'm coming from California. However, I honestly feel that this whole thing has been overhyped, especially when you compare it to the seasonal flu that the news seldom mentions these days. If you are healthy without underlying conditions, you are likely going to have no problem. We know people who have cancelled their vacation plans just this week due to all of this but unless there are travel restrictions put into place or we become sick ourselves, we are not changing our plans. We will keep our hands washed, keep our immune systems healthy & choose to believe that all will be well.Edited: 2:00 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Thank you everyone. I agree the news has definitely spun this into overdrive, not at all undermining the seriousness of this virus and the tragic deaths as a result. My mother is in her mid-70s and was planning to join our family of 4. She is considering staying behind, although our GP told her to go (he is traveling to Florida soon himself and he’s late 60s). At this time of panic it’s nice to hear reassurance from fellow travellers. Our family desperately needs this holiday to unwind and reconnect."
"There are more cases in Toronto than in Cayman right now. Cayman is being very proactive in trying to keep this under control - https:/…cruise-ship-corona.htmlSome say they are being over-cautious. I am assuming that you will be taking a direct flight from Toronto so you don't have to worry about other airports. Pearson is the place i would be most concerned, and I would just take normal precautions there."
"We are leaving April 12th from Pittsburgh connecting in Charlotte. While I have been keeping a close eye on all the news I have absolutely zero plans to cancel, barring some unforeseen horrible turn of events. I’ve been looking forward to this trip for a long time. I’m only nervous about what the next five weeks holds as far as increased cases and or any cases getting into the Caribbean. I also have an upcoming trip to Aruba at the end of June. It just sucks that it puts a slight damper on the excitement level but still can’t wait. I’ll be in London, Ontario for a concert in two weeks as well but traveling by car. Little nervous for that as well but I can’t let this whole thing affect my life. Safe travels."
We'll be on island next Saturday! Not nervous about traveling & can't wait to get there!!
"We leave from Boston straight flight in 20 days. I am nervous, but we will use extra good hand hygiene and wipe more surfaces down. I am glad they are cleaning the planes more. Safe travels everyone."
"Heading out next Saturday and my biggest worry is that American Airlines will cancel our flight. Once in the caymans, I am really,really looking forward to getting far from all the corona news that is like a virus taking over the news networks.Edited: 6:27 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"We leave for Grand Cayman in a few weeks, and yes I am nervous about traveling. We fly out of Toronto. The airport and flight make me the most concerned. But we have had this trip planned for so long that we don’t plan on canceling, unless forced to do so. This whole virus does put a damper on our vacation anticipation, but we are going to be cautious with hand washing and cleaning surfaces, and we know once we get there all these worries will melt away in the sunshine!"
Same! Leaving in couple of weeks. Just like others have said.. watching the news and washing hands. Trying to stay calm and enjoy my vacation.
"I arrived on GCM from JFK on Wednesday. JFK was perhaps a bit more quiet than usual for a midweek morning, but plenty of travelers & our flight was about 3/4 full. Immigration did ask which countries we had recently visited. I believe that if we had said China, we might have a problem. People here are concerned, but not as paranoid as US residents are. There are currently no cases of Corona on GC, but rest assured, it’s coming. Everywhere."
I probably made the mistake of reading an article tonight about the exponential spread of the disease that spoke about the doubling of the amount of cases every 6 days in the US. That gets us to one million infections by the end of April. The amount of available hospital beds that will be available and length of hospital stays will be an issue. I am not trying to spread fear and panic but I agree with the last message posted. This is going to get scary folks. I am one to choose to not believe things could get this bad but I’m starting to think that’s a naive way of thinking when you do the math. Scary. I’m getting more fearful by the day.

"Does anyone have concerns about being able to return from Cayman to the US? We're booked to be there from March 21-April 4, from Boston, nonstop Jet Blue. Could immigration in the US shut everything down or quarantine us in cardboard boxes at the airport?"
I guess that would all depend on whether or not there would be a large outbreak situation that happened in Grand Cayman. Seems unlikely in such a short time frame as you’re traveling in a couple weeks. I have 5 weeks before we travel so I’m a little more concerned with the amount of cases by then than I’d be if I were traveling 2 weeks from now. I’m guessing you will be fine. I’m even more concerned about my upcoming travel to Aruba in late June. God only knows what the situation looks like by then.
We have tickets to land in AUA on April 2. We are in a wait and see mode
"Thanks for that Twitter thread, IOvethebeach. Sobering. We’re due to travel to Cayman in July, but have trips with kids planned to Playa del Carmen and Bonaire before that. We’ll likely make “game time” decisions about each trip and be prepared to lose money. We’re not alarmists and we love our vacations, but the scientists and epidemiologists are starting to send a very serious message."
"We're leaving this Friday March 13 for Caribbean cruise. Have been so looking forward to it, Just can't cancel. So let's all take lots of Clorox wipes. Completely wipe down airplane seat and folding table, door handles and everything in bathroom. And suitcase! Let's be healthy, get lots of sleep, wash our hands etc. These are the only things we can control... Otherwise, let's all continue to live our lives."
I am currently on Grand Cayman and have absolutely no fears about being able to return to NY next Saturday. Actually I am more fearful about what I might find when I return to Long Island NY. People here on GC are well aware of the corona virus. Life continues. Perhaps this is the new normal.
Traveling to GC in a few weeks. ZERO concerns
Bringing my 77 year old mom next month for our annual mother / daughter vacation. It will be our first time going to the Cayman’s. We were super excited. I have zero fears for myself. My husband and I are going in Anguilla in May with zero concern. My issue is my mom. She has no serious health issues but does have a laundry list of minor things. We are waiting to see. Luckily our hotel can be cancelled 7 days before and Jet Blue changes our flight times by over an hour so we can decline and get my points back and a voucher for my mom. She just started taking vitamin c and zinc to boost her immune system. She will also speak to her doctor.
"I echo many sentiments of the previous posts. Not so much worried about catching something in GC, more so in transit through the airport and airplane. My mother is 76 and has been given the go ahead to travel given this situation, however I’m still nervous about her joining us."
My concern is more about quarantine possibilities either upon arrival or when I get home. It’s hard to say what can happen in a few weeks.But I’m planning to be on island April 2-9.
We haven’t had any cases yet so unless they quarantine everyone who travels anywhere they is no reason to quarantine people who have been to a country where no one is infected.
"As a 70 something with underlying health issues, if I had plans to be on GC as a stayover guest soon would not cancel or be at all worried. If a cruise passenger would probably cancel given the current cruise ship issues not being able to disembark due to “whatever” potential concerns might come into play and also the risk of being under quarantine at end of the cruise."
"So far, no cases. It is inevitable that will change of course. Cayman is fortunate as it is far more straightforward to quarantine a small island than what a lot of the world will shortly have to contend with. If there are no presumptive cases there on Cayman yet you may as well go for it. The odds (right now) are still very low that anyone on your plane will be infected."
"Our flight isn’t until May. It can either get better by then or way worse. We are kind of just playing the waiting game. However, if my trip was soon I would be a tad nervous but still go."
"Having thought more about it, I retract my recommendation to travel. There is a moderate chance of a quarantine. For such a small island it will only take a few cases of COVID-19 on Cayman for the country to lock it's doors. It seems inevitable to me that those will measures will be taken at some point once the virus reaches GC. Either they quarantine the island before you arrive, after or while you are there. Thousands of cruise ship passengers make their way through Georgetown daily. It is only a matter of time before Cayman too is affected. Ask yourself if you'd rather be quarantined at home or abroad. However small the chance, it isn't an unrealistic one."
"I almost have to laugh at someone who has ZERO concerns. You’re either incredibly naive or one of those people who just refuses to accept the reality of the situation. That’s the scary part of this entire scenario. So many people just refusing to admit that this is a legitimate health crisis that will affect millions of people in the days and months to come. Again, not trying to be Debbie downer. I’ve looked forward to this trip to GC for months. There’s nothing I want more than a nice relaxing vacation right now, but we’re in the midst of a pandemic. Let’s not refuse to acknowledge the obvious."
Playing it day by day . Traveling to Grand Cayman on March 27th to April direct flight both ways from JFK. Problem is my job says that if I go then when I get back could be quarantine from going to work for 14 days .Which is crazy since Grand Cayman doesn't have any cases.
We are booked for end of March. Probably won’t decide until day before we leave. I’m concerned about a large outbreak there with limited facilities/resources to address that. Also getting quarantined there/not able to travel home. Cases in US expected to spike this week as more testing kits made available.
"As each day comes, travel to anywhere is looking more iffy. Not so much due to the actual virus BUT for the potential to either not be permitted to get back home or be quarantined. For sure this germ is a risk to a certain segment of the population, but the panic that has been created and promoted far exceeds rational thought. Think about it....each day in the USA more than 100 people die from effects of regular flu and the reaction to that is nil!"
"Lovethebeach, my thoughts exactly."
Love the beach....good postPlanes have always been filled with germs...my concern is being quarantined on an island...due to people boarding planes knowing full well they are sick
"Thanks dean and canadasunny. I am taking it day by day and seeing how this goes. I stand to lose a lot of money with flights and accommodations if I can’t go and the thought of missing out on this vacation would be devastating. It’s a surprise for my wife, she doesn’t even know where we are going. I’m praying we can still go but the reality of the situation is very concerning with the potential of quarantine and such. I wish the best for everyone so their much deserved travel to such a wonderful place can come to fruition."
"We leave for the Caymans on March 22. Have been planning for many months and are so excited. Ritz isn't willing to let us cancel (cancellation date has passed, it's 21 days before arrival) and American won't credit any change fees because we purchased our flights 6 months ago. We stand to lose many thousands. I still want to go, but the thought of being stuck in the Caymans, as much as I'd love it, has me really scared -- we cannot absorb the cost of living there for two extra weeks or more. I don't know what to do :-("
"The peripheral casualties of this pandemic are just beginning to unfold. Cancellation questions, quarantine issues, travel bans, there will be endless horror stories on this and every forum.At some point, there will be a collective shift in policy from the Ritz and your airline at some point, I am confident. Unfortunately, that change may not come into effect in time for you. I recommend to keep contacting them. They are being bombarded with requests to cancel flights and rooms and are trying to hang on for dear life right now. I imagine you will have better luck with the hotel but keep trying to at least reschedule it. Exponentially, we will all be rapidly shifting our thinking from saving our livelihoods to saving our lives. I have no doubt eventually Ritz and AA will get there"
"It’s doubtful you would be quarantined in Cayman if you are a visitor trying to return to your home. The quarantine would happen when you return home. It is what it is but it is best not to worry about something that may be unrealistic. If the US wants you quarantined they will do it unless something major changes. Why do you think they are sending the foreign nationals back to their homeland when the ship with infected passengers finally arrives in Oakland,CA?"
"Nobody is going to refund on a cancellation right now - their insurance policies won't cover it, so instead of you being out of money, they will be.What I have seen in the past is that if the government starts issuing travel advisories, then the airlines and hotels, etc. will be able to refund your money. Cancelling before this time would mean you lose the money.I would wait."
"I'm not afraid of being quarantined for two weeks at home. I'm afraid of Cayman potentially closing its doors to prevent the virus from coming in to the extent possible. If we are there and they close their borders, what does that mean for us?"
Closing borders means that they do not want people entering the country - I'm sure they will have no problem with you leaving. More concerning for this specific case would be if the USA closes its borders.
"I'm traveling in one week (3/16), flying in direct from Charlotte. I have some concerns, but they're more about the various governments implementing travel restrictions than getting seriously ill. Like others, my employer has warned that I may be told to stay away for two weeks when I return, but I'll get my full regular pay without having to use any vacation or sick time so that honestly doesn't sound too bad to me.I plan on taking all the regular precautions (wash my hands, hand sanitizer, covering my mouth when I sneeze, etc.)"
"We are scheduled to leave in 19 days, with a connection through CLT. At this point, no plans to cancel or reschedule. That said, a lot can happen in the next 19 days, so I'll continue to monitor and be flexible in my decision.At this point, I'm not that worried about getting sick. As we are relatively, healthy people, I still think I'm at a greater risk of getting the flu (even with the flu shot), than I am picking up COVID-19. Like others, I think the greater concern is being quarantined upon my return home. At this point, unlikely, but something to watch.The most frustrating thing for me is the fact that it would appear, you can be asymptomatic, and have the virus. So, people who are travelling from or through hot spots, and not following the self quarantine suggestions, are the bigger risk. At that, I would have to be in close contact with someone who has the virus, or have touched something that they directly coughed or sneezed on in order to contract the virus. At this point, these odds seem pretty low to me. Not impossible, but low risk today."
Sarah E - no one can predict what things will be like a week from now - let alone over a month from now. I'm not sure how things are now will relate to how they may be a month+ from now either.
"Sarah....I agree with the above. No one can predict the future of travel right now any more than they can predict the weather. I flew from JFK to GCM last week and will return this Saturday. JFK was perhaps a bit less crowded than usual on a weekday morning, but still quite busy. Our flight was a few seats less than full."
"Agree:) just curious, thank you for your response."
"Thank you, I agree with both of you. Was just curious. We are keeping updated by the caymans cdc site and consulate. Thanks for your response."
My family and I are traveling from Oregon to Grand cayman in two weeks. I’m also feeling afraid our trip will be cancelled. Ugh. I need a vacation from my pre-vacation stress.
"I went through DC Reagan and Charlotte this past week - looked like the standard flow of people. I didn't see any cancelled flights. One or two people wandering around in builder's dust masks, but that was it - no surgical masks.To the person who is bringing masks - masks are pretty much worse than useless when it comes to preventing you from catching anything. They would only be used if you had symptoms.Pick your news source:Time: https:/…FoxNews: https://www.foxnews.com/health/do-surgical-m…NPR: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/20…"
We just cancelled. So sad but I was traveling with my 77 year old mom. We were going next month. Hope to rebook sometime this year
"If you are wearing a mask it will be assumed by many that you are the ill one. If flying you may be tagged for enhanced scrutiny. A friend who is an epidemiologist at the CDC advised us to use Clorox wipes, hand sanitizers, frequent hand washing if traveling or going to crowded places and that wearing a mask is useless. She has 3 young children and when at the grocery store on Sunday they asked why a few of the shoppers were wearing masks. Her reply was “those people are either sick or ignorant.”"
"I don't think the actual concern here is catching the virus unless you are in a high risk category. The concern here would be getting stuck somewhere. Quarantined, not allowed entry back in to the U.S. Not allowed on a a plane etc. New York State just cordoned off a city in Westchester county. No one in or out. Italy is for all intense and purpose closed.  Whether it is panic or not is besides the point. It is a realistic risk that your travel plans could be significantly compromised . B."
"They have cordoned of a 1 mile area of New Rochelle that surrounds a synagogue where a I think couple people tested positive. Those who show no signs of illness and outside that small area can walk around, go to work, businesses are open, etc. Somehow these isolated incidents are being way overblown and such infection is becoming worse than Covid-19! The only reason I would cancel existing plans is due to the uncontrollable consequences of various irrational measures that might be forthcoming."
lovecayman - exactly my point. You cannot control these reactions by our government. B.
"Yup, at every level of government those in charge are in a frantic bouncing off the walls posture because they have no clue what to do. Well, my parents, who grew up during the Great Depression and came of age during WW2, always followed FDR’s advice of the only thing to fear is fear itself along with the belief that if you do not know what to do, do nothing! They did not instill fear when they brought us as young kids to Polio clinics for shots nor when we were young teenagers during the Cuban Missle Crisis. I say offer facts, basic help in any crisis and then let individuals decide what is the best way for them to manage going forward."
I wasn’t nervous until reading this thread. We leave 4/17 for a week. At this point I think I can get my condo deposit refunded since its more than 30 days out. I can change my flight with United too for free. But I don’t want to miss my vacation! But I’m worried about waiting and then something happening where they won’t let in visitors. Or we get stuck in GCM (can’t afford that!). If I can go and GCM will have us I still want to go at this point.
"I'm scheduled to fly to Turks and Caicos from JFK on 4/8/20. JetBlue will give me credit if I decide that's what I want to do but Airbnb isn't so willing. At this point in time, I'm comfortable traveling but don't want to lose the money that I paid to Airbnb. Any suggestions?Thanks."
"We were supposed to go for a week starting next weekend. We cancelled last night. I'm bummed, but I do not want to risk getting stuck/quarantined there. Even though the risk may be small, I think I'd be somewhat anxious for the entire trip. The first time I called the hotel and airline, a few days ago, they were unwilling to help. Yesterday, they waived fees and refunded/credited us without a problem, so no money lost. Grateful for that."
"AirB&B says hosts and guests can cancel free of charges due to extenuating circumstances if your flight is cancelled or if you are coming from Italy, South Korea, or China, have medical or disease control duties, suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19. I would check to see what the fee will be to cancel and weigh the pros and cons."
"I'm nervous too. I'm scheduled to arrive on 3/28. Mostly nervous that there will be travel bans in place by then (I'm in the US). At this point it feels like I'll be infected at some point regardless, but I'm more concerned about being part of the larger problem of spreading to other (more vulnerable) people, while or after traveling. News is scary, but I'll have a firm idea if things are really bad (or hopefully not) by the end of the month."
"I am afraid of travel bans happening while traveling too and not being able to get back. There are a lot of foreigners stuck in Italy right now due to travel bans - for good reason - but scary that it could happen anywhere.Edited: 5:27 pm, March 11, 2020 "
In the same boat with Airbnb. Let me know what happens with you!
"I decided to pull the plug on my 4/17 trip today. I’m sad. I really want to visit Grand Cayman. I just think I will enjoy it more when the dust settles worldwide. There’s just enough chaos right now that it doesn’t feel like an ideal time to visit a bucket list destination or leave the country to go anywhere. Our president is unpredictable and he acts quickly. Things change so much in an hour that Lord only knows what the situation will be in a month. Because I have no ability to predict what will happen I at least want to be in my home where I have the most control over my environment. Also, they grounded a flight yesterday for someone with allergies - I have terrible allergies that could easily be mistaken for symptoms of a virus. I could also get a virus and mistake them for spring allergies. I don’t want to chance accidentally killing a sweet old lady that has the misfortune of sitting next to me if I don’t know I’m sick. It’s also not worth the possibility of having the US quarantine me in a military facility for two weeks while I’m paying for what was supposed to be a great vacation. I feel like it’s just best to reschedule at a later date. That’s just my opinion and input on the post about being nervous."
"I have a trip planned in April and am planning on going unless a travel ban is put in place before. I think this may be a great time to fly.., cleaner planes, less people, shorter security lines. I will just do like I would do during every trip- wash my hands often and clean surfaces."
"I'm with you bigbeachballs! we are supposed to go in two weeks and if that plane goes, I'm on it! afraid though that travel bans may change that plan :-( you are right though - planes will be the cleanest they've ever been!"
"We're not nervous, but trying to ""hang loose"" as the situation seems to be fluid. My teenagers and I are scheduled to fly in on Tuesday 3/17 from Dallas."
"I can tell you that as of today cruise ships are here, flights are arriving/departing, the water sports ops are busy, & it’s a beautiful day!"
"Unfortunately my earlier reply on this thread has to be updated. Now that the conference we were coming to GC to attend is on the verge of cancellation, I am already checking into what things we can get refunded if this trip does not happen. Thankfully airlines are allowing cancel/rebook without fees if you fly bf by Dec 2020. Will the airlines fly planes that are 3/4 empty? I doubt it. For all I know, AA will cancel our Monday flight anyway. Already contacted our condo complex to verify we are out our entire $$ which is obviously what the contract stated so it is definitely their right to keep all our money if we can't make it there. Maybe they don't want us Californians coming to GC right now anyway. We didn't get trip insurance & I don't think it would have covered coronavirus issues anyway unless we were quarantined/sick. Good times....Ugh......"
Unfortunately things seem to be exponentially collapsing. For those who have no concerns about travel that will not be the issue when other factors prevent them from making their own personal decisions. I would expect to be ready for greatly enhanced scrutiny upon arrival at GCM even if able to go there. There are restaurants in the USA that are now taking the temperature of every patron prior to allow entry.

"Press conference now, one confirmed case here-a cruise ship passenger who was admitted to Health City with cardiac issues, currently in isolation at Health City. Cayman Compass is covering it live on their facebook page. Waiting results on one more individual."
Anything can happen in the coming months. None of us know for sure what that looks like. Speaking in hypotheticals is like predicting the weather in a month or two. I would be shocked if GC completely shuts down visitors from coming in. That would decimate their economy id think. Let’s stop guessing what may happen and see what actually does happen.
"l0vethebeach87.....I contacted our condo complex by email & have been assured that we can either have all our money put towards a future trip later this year or even 2021 or else if we need to cancel completely, we will only lose half our initial deposit plus a cancel fee - so we will get at least over half of our money back due to these special, unfortunate circumstances if we cancel. I am so glad I emailed them to check! That makes our decision easier & I have a feeling we will cancel. Schools are about to close around us & I kind of feel like if a quarantine happens, I want to be near home base - not out of the country or stuck in an airport elsewhere."
"IF the latest missive that restricting airline travel within the USA comes to being, it will be devastating.Edited: 7:03 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"CaCountryGirl that’s awesome! Glad to hear that you won’t be out with a total loss, that does make it a little easier to cope but doesn’t make it suck less not being able to go now. I wish you all the best in your future travels."
"@lovecayman, where did you see this?"
"Yesterday President Trump stated he was considering stopping travel to California and the State of Washington if the virus becomes more prevalent in those locations. No clue how he could limit it to just those places when the virus is so widespread. Anyway, at 3 PM today he is speaking again and pretty much everyone thinks he will declare a national state of emergency. That would basically free up funds to deal with this problem but who knows what other measures will be added."
"Ah ok so it's not a general restriction they are talking about yet. Good to know. We'll see what comes out at today's press conferences, in the US and Cayman."
"A couple of school closures on GC, lots of events cancelled, Health City closed for 2 weeks as 10 workers were exposed to the gentleman who tested positive, a passenger on Cayman Air flight today from Miami with suspected case of corona virus....but NO travel ban by Cayman Islands as of now. Things seem to change very quickly so it is anybody’s guess what the days and weeks ahead could bring. As an older person with underlying health issues I am not at all worried about contracting this virus and do what I have always done. However, there are simply too many matters up in the air right now that would probably contribute significantly to a less than relaxing vacation so we are staying home until matters stabilize.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 13, 2020 "
We were planning to arrive this coming Tuesday but the board meetings we were coming to attend were cancelled as of yesterday & so we have chosen to cancel the entire trip. We are from CA & do not want to face the possibility of not being able to get back home to our kids/family. Our out-of-state college kid has had classes switched to online from home & the high schooler's school could close at any time. Just not a good time to be away from home.
"I emailed the condo that we are staying at in April to ask if they have changed their cancellation policy because of Coronavirus. They said it remains the same (I can get my deposit back if I cancel by March 19th. But after that I lost my deposit. She said they are talking with the board of directors to see if anything can be done in light of the situation. I'd be happy to take a wait and see approach and if we can't go, use the $$ towards a future trip.My other thought it to cancel on the 19th and keep my flights and just rebook a few days before? I'm guessing there will be SOMETHING available.I did buy trip insurance, so I am hoping if we cannot go (due to being sick ourselves, or if Cayman starts restricting US visitors) that maybe my insurance will refund us. But I am not sure."
It appears Cayman gov't is having a press conference shortly - unclear what they may announce but work keeping an eye on it. Cayman Compass should cover it quickly.
https://www.exploregov.ky/coronavirus
https:/…
Given all the uncertainty and quickly changing restictions it sadly is best not to go.
"We canceled our trip which was supposed to be April 4-11. Our condo owner graciously allowed us to cancel even though our window for cancelling with a refund was past. We will use the money towards a future trip to Grand Cayman when it is safe and enjoyable to go. It’s the responsible thing to do. Even if you are young and healthy and wouldn’t die if you caught corona, you can pass it to someone else and contribute to the problem. We are beyond sad. But our time will come for a nice relaxing vacation. With all the news reports I’m seeing, I’m assuming we would’ve had to cancel anyway because I’m sure more travel restrictions will be put in place very soon."
"Wise advice, and same to you, S"
If anyone is there can you please let us know if grocery stores and restaurants are open?
Yes they are-no restrictions on the grocery stores and restaurants are limited to a 50 person capacity. Many of the restaurants will do delivery during this time.
"Just pulled the plug on our trip. We were supposed to leave in 14 days. Healthy City’s temporary closure was our deciding factor. If providing care to one person caused this much strain on the system, the last they need is more people that will strain the system even more. It’s not a matter of if we will get the virus, so much as when.We were able to reschedule for summer. Hopefully, this will all be over by then."
"Its folks like you that can spread the virus. Your troubles aren't going to melt away in the sun, because this is a global epidemic. We all wish our vacations have been out on hold, but numbers don't lie and we have to take the precautions that have be laid out for us. Be safe, be well and be smart."
"Currently is is not about being nervous but more about if you can travel due to restrictions, airline route availability, mandated quarantines upon arrival. Travel from anywhere to anywhere for the next several months or more is most likely not in the cards."
