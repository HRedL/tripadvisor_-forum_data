"Is there anyone out there that has done travel covid testing? I have checked with my PCP, they only test symptomatic patients. Hawaii says they are teaming up with CVS/Walgreens/Kaiser to do travel covid testing. I’ve spent hours listening to recorded pharmacy messages and still no info. Help please!"
"Trix, you can't get an answer because there isn't one yet.Just today the Lt. gov indicated the quarantine will be extended past 09-01. But he dodged the ""till when"" question because only the guv. can make that call.He said they are ""ready"" to do CVS tests but also said they haven't decided on some of the other ones--like NAAT instead of PCR. There is no way the test/quarantine process will happen for September 1st."
"NJ has availability of testing for asymptomatic persons and for travel. How about a pre Hawaii road trip ? But seriously, Just a clarification. The majority of molecular tests for COVID-19 are PCR ( polymerase chain reaction) which is a type of NAAT(nucleic acid amplification test) This includes those run by CVS and the major labs(Quest/LabCorp). Another type of NAAT is LAMP ( loop mediated isothermal amplification). This is the technology used in the device most likely to be in a doctor’s office or clinic. Developed by Abbott Labs, and gives results on the same day. By using the more general term, NAAT as the type of test required , rather than the more specific PCR,the directive will I believe encompass both types, which I think would increase the options for pre travel testing, assuming that state public health guidelines based on test availability allow testing of asymptomatic individuals. There initially were questions about the sensitivity/ specificity of the Abbott test , but I believe these have been addressed"
"trixter - contact your COUNTY health department. They have the bottom-line legal authority for public health (along with the State). Check on-line, first ... see what they have. What county are you in?"
"Thanks so much, Kauai48! I knew I didn't say it right after I looked back. I appreciate you clearing it up.The lt. gov didn't specify which test/companies might be accepted here in Hawaii. I still don't think it will happen in Sept.SW"
"https://covid19.ca.govThis a good place to start ... keep up with the basics. And again, your county health department can give you guidance (as well as stats)."
"Betty Lou,It doesn't matter what her county has if HAWAII won't accept that.Again----no one knows whether the quarantine will be modified on September 1st. If it isn't you must stay inside your hotel room for 14 days or until you leave the island."
"""It doesn't matter what her county has if HAWAII won't accept that."" Duh!But, overall, she needs a reliable local source of information ... and pharmacies or individual docs aren't the best references. Again - knowing which county she's in can guide to a stable, local source of official information (along with the State of CA). This isn't to tackle Hawaii's restrictions (again, duh!) ... but so she knows where to direct her questions."
"Since she wants a test for travel to Hawaii, I disagree, Betty Lou.Today, the Lt. Guv here did again say that they had a plan with CVS. What test, how much $, how long, etc. etc is what I believe Trix is looking for.Those are all questions to which no one has an answer yet."
The Lt Gov also hinted in the past that Hawaii was watching Alaska's plan as well. They have been open to tourism (with pre-travel testing involved vs quarantine)) for about a month now and did experience some initial upticks in cases as a result. Adjustments were made along the way to correct any shortfalls that may have allowed some exposures to enter.This update below looks recent as of 8/11/20. One thing I noticed is that they are now offering arrival testing at a cost of $250 per every traveler from out of state if you did not get one 72 hours pre-departure. About double the cost. It also identifies certain tests acceptable and those not acceptable.It will be interesting if Hawaii follows this plan to some degree...https://www.alaskatravel.com/updates
Placer County California...
"https://www.placer.ca.gov/coronavirus Here's Placer County's coronavirus specific link. Here's the link for the State of CA Public Health Department - which should have broader info on travel. https://www.cdph.ca.gov(I'm in Placer, too. Beastly hot week ahead!)"
"Well, here is a link to your county's public health department COVID page. https:/…Novel-Coronavirus-COVID-19Whether it contains information that will help you find out how to get a COVID test for travel remains to be seen. I did a quick scan of the Los Angeles County Public Health COVID FAQ page, where I live, and did not see any information about testing for travel, though they did point out that travel during the pandemic will help to spread the virus, and does not help with keeping case counts down, as we all know."
Don’t get excited about what you read. There’s been articles out for weeks saying Hawai’i will open up on September 1st. Nothing has been announced here as of 8-12-20. The governor hasn’t made that announcement here and he is the only one that can make that decision.
"Trix, that is old information. We don't know if it will happen. It's very unlikely"
Hawaii has been watching the results in Alaska for a month. Here's the thing: what worked yesterday may not today.
https:/…Found this on the Alaska COVID site... seems pretty good for finding test sites... it's National and accurate for my neck of the woods... you can filter for the type test you want... and obviously call to see what the times are for results.NOTE - It does run slow... be patient... it will load in a minute or so at worst most times.
"Until Hawaii says what test(s) they will accept, and when the quarantine will be modified---this is not going to help Trix.It's giving her false hope , IMO, plus maybe about to cost her $$$. I expect the Muppet guv will announce the push back of the ""modified"" quarantine date to October in the next couple of days. So all this test/which/when will be irrelevant.The 14 day quarantine will remain total and mandatory."
There are 355 new cases today. Most on Oahu. There are also 2 more deaths.Best plan on cancelling..........it's not going to get better any time soon.
"LOL......came across this when looking for the restaurant thread. Dang, called it again, didn't I?And before Trix or someone else asks--yes, the mandatory quarantine was extended to AT LEAST October 1st, and Hawaii *****still hasn't said what test(s) will be accepted***** when the quarantine is modified.........The ""Pre Test Plan"" hasn't been set or announced. And frankly, I'll be amazed if the quarantine is modified on or soon after October 1st either. Too many cases and too few medical facilities, at least as of now. Even Ige said ""at least"" October 1st.There **may** be a quarantine bubble established at some resorts, an idea that has been floated since July. But you would be required to stay at the resort ONLY for 2 weeks. Some resorts are trying to work this idea out for later September or October.Edited: 7:02 pm, August 21, 2020 "
"I have a suggestion. STOP saying that ""the mandatory quarantine has been extended until at least [insert latest date here]"". Just stop.Yes, technically that is a true statement. But it only serves to confuse more people than it does clarify the true state of things. Why? Because all they see is the date. They skip right over the ""at least"" part and they get the idea fixed in their heads that as of [whatever date], then they can go. They rush to book tickets, Airbnb, they start getting out their flipflops and luau wear. You've seen this here a thousand times, and you will keep seeing it as they come back, outraged, and protest that they were TOLD they could come on [whatever date] so they booked nonrefundable things and now they're heartbroken, it's all your fault, their lives are ruined, and they're going to seek revenge by finding some way to sneak in and to hell with you and your damned quarantines! Sound familiar?Rather than telling them ""the mandatory quarantine has been extended until at least [some date]"" do them and yourself a favor. Tell them this instead:""A mandatory quarantine is in effect will continue to be in effect indefinitely. There is no date yet when it's expected to be lifted. The quarantine period has been extended and extended every month since last winter, and will probably be extended again many times. Right now nobody knows when it will be possible to travel to the state without quarantine, but it will not be for some time. The quarantine will be re-evaluated after [whatever the current next update is] and at that point, it probably will be extended for another month or more. Do not plan any nonessential travel to the state. Period. Eventually, when the quarantine is lifted, it will be well publicized, so don't worry, you're not going to miss it.""As they used to say in the newspaper business, ""don't bury the lead"". Say the most important stuff right up front, clearly. That would be ""the quarantine is in effect and will continue, and you should not plan travel to the state"". Period. Do not confuse them by giving a date that they will misinterpret as the day they can get on a plane bound for the state.Hope this is helpful."
"I see what you are saying, and agree to a point. But, where does it stop?"
"Thank you for some new input! So.....for myself, I am comfortable to book month to month with refundable flight/hotel. Because....when tourists are safely welcome back, flights and hotels will likely become $$$$$, and less available.. I currently am ready for October with a great flight price, and great hotel price. I am very aware this might not happen, but am ready to go, and fortunately have the flexibility to change plans frequently."
"> I see what you are saying, and agree to a point. But, where does it stop?It stops when everything is back to ""like before."" That won't be soon. That's the point that 90% of would-be visitors aren't getting. If you give a date up front, then add some ""asterisk language"" they'll forget the details and just remember the date, and they'll plan to fly there the day after. It's like advertising: keep it simple and just. Keep. Repeating. It.""You can't come. Don't plan to come. We will let you know when that changes. Until then, you can't come"" (repeat)> So.....for myself, I am comfortable to book month to month with refundable flight/hotel. You are in the minority. I think 99% of potential visitors have one thing in their minds: the magical date when everything reverts back to The Before Times. They hear a date, that's all they remember, they figure that's when the Rapture comes, and they immediately book a ticket for the day after the Rapture."
"LFG, you mean like the threads I do titled Covid Info etc? :-). And ones I've done titled ""Quarantine Extended...""?Problem is even in those, people say ""but I heard"" ""But I read"", ""but the grocery store clerk at home told me"". Kind of like this one.I absolutely agree about people expecting a magic ""finish"" button in time.Edited: 1:17 pm, August 23, 2020 "
