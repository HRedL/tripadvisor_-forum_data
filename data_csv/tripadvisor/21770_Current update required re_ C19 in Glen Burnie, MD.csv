"Hi GuysI am due to travel to Maryland in September from London. Staying with relatives in Glen Burnie.Just wondering what is the current situation in the Baltimore area in terms of what is open to Joe Public in terms of bars/ parks/beaches/ eateries etc etc.I am due to arrive on 9th September, travelling from New York, assuming the flight leaves London of course.Whilst I don't expect anyone to have a crystal ball, is there any update on the likely situation in early September ie a second wave of C19 or if, by then the cases will be starting to reduce and social distance restrictions will be less.Thanks for any information.NeilEdited: 6:24 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"Restaurants have limited indoor dining. Places in Annapolis and Baltimore are opening outside dining on the streets. Beaches and parks are open- social distancing is obviously encouraged. More and more activities have been opening, as Maryland's COVID positivity rate continues to decline.I'd be more concerned about your flight not being cancelled. We have a trip to Italy scheduled for September and have started planning an alternative trip domestically. But, miracles happen! :)"
"Hithanks for your reply. I am sort of encouraged that if I actually get across ,it won't be so bad in terms of getting out and enjoying the hospitality on offer."
There are signs at the airport stating that travellers arriving from New York must quarantine for 14 days.
"To be honest: No matter what it's like this week, it may be different next week. Or it might not. September might as well be a century away. The only thing you can count on it that you should wear a mask if you go in anywhere, or are outside and less than 6 feet from people. Places might be open, and places might not. How is it in Essex, England? Same as Glen Burnie, I'll bet."
"“ There are signs at the airport stating that travellers arriving from New York must quarantine for 14 days.”There is no such requirement. If there are signs stating that, they’re either being misinterpreted or they should be removed."
