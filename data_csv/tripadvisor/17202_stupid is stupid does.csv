" why do people continue to jump off a cliff, when clearly there are concerns about this flu, to begin with it is hyped alot but the reason is there is no medicine that works on this flu,I have been going to cancun,maya area for 15 yrs and I would be a little concerned about going to another country at the height of an outbreak in which their goverment does not have control over,so you go and get the virus unknowly you carry it back to your family and friends, Dont be so selfish. Just think before you go,and yes I hate it that anyone has to cancel or change their vacation, just think !!!! "
"I for one find nothing funny or joke worthy about this whole SF thing. Amazes me some people can make a joke of it and call it just media hype.To me it's showing everyone how medically uninformed and ignorant they are. If people want to travel to Cancun it is their decision. But, please don't write it off and make jokes about the media hysteria. The president of this country , the WHO, the CDC, airlines, cuiselines and other countries have nothing to do with media hype. They know there is a destinct possibility of a pandemic. There has now been 3 confirmed cases here in Maine. Just confirmed tonight. A school and day care are closed until further notice.Just wanted to say I loved your thread heading... My name is Bubba Gump.. Best movie ever !!! "
"Regarding the statement that ""there is no medicine that works on this flu""... According to the CDC and WHO websites both Tamiflu and Ralenza (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir) can treat the A/1H1N Swine Flu strain. Both drugs are currently recommended as effective treatment options. What does not currently exist is a vaccine for the A/1H1N Swine Flu strain."
wasn't obama in mexico city just last week?
"ladyme, you said exactly what I was thinking, but you posted quicker than me. Thanks. :-) This is a very serious situation and I hate to say it, but I am stipulating my travels to Cancun in August. I'm waiting for more updates, but it doesn't look good now. I worry about my children more than just having a good time in the sun. Sorry, but everyone has there own preferences, I choose to worry and wait. Hopefully things will get better soon for ALL. :-)"
I don't think the medicines work all the time. I think you have to get them early enough and they still don't work for everyone.I don't think you should be telling everyone not to worry because there are medicines.
WW2564: luv it!
"wickedwitch:To answer your question about Obama - here's what I read:U.S. President Barack Obama may have been exposed to swine flu on his trip to Mexico last week. Obama was greeted by archeologist Felipe Solis at a museum in Mexico City where they warmly embraced. Felipe Solis was dead the next day from what was described then as swine flu symptoms, although local health officials changed the diagnosis to non-descriptive “pneumonia” for apparent diplomatic reasons.Reports are that Obama knew about the outbreak three days before his visit but decided to go anyway. His imprudence may have been pushed by criticism for having never visited Mexico during his short lifetime before the presidency.There's plenty info ""out there"" - google it and see what you find."
"It's nice to see that at least a FEW people here ARE actually thinking responsibly. We go to Mexico every year, we were booked for the first week in June, but have cancelled (and lost $400) in hopes that things will die down and we can reschedule before too long. I too, REALLY need a vacation after the school year ends, but is it worth taking a chance that I will become VERY sick, bring the illness home to others in my community who might not have the immune system to fight it off, or heaven forbid, bring it home to my kids?!? There is no beach in the world (or bottle of Tequila since it's being referred to so much) that is worth that. To the TA members who are condemning all of us ""haters"" and ""nay-sayers"", by all means, go on your Mexico vacation, but when you come home, stay away from the public for a few days until you are sure that you are not passing it on to others! And for those who keep referring to the statistics of the ""regular flu"" and how many people it kills each year.... This is a NEW virus that we know very little about. It hasn't had time to kill as many people as other viral diseases have. If we continue with this attitude of no concern other than our own selfish pleasures, it could very well become a flu that kills over 30,000 a year in a matter of time."
"cancun_susieQ - Where did I ""tell everyone not to worry""? "
"Worldwide, a LOT more people die in traffic accidents each day, than have died from this ""epidemic"". You gonna park the car and walk, too? "
"uncleD, Why would you compared this to getting hit by a car? Your right in saying you could be killed walking out the door. It happens every minute of the day. I saw more then my share of those cases in the 15 years I worked at the largest medical center in my state. But, do people try to go out and get ""hit by a car"". Of course not! People also shouldn't try to expose themselves to a hybrid viruses with genetics components, with no none cure. As I have said in other threads, I love Cancun, I love the Mexican people,I love Trip Advisor. I have gotten lots of great imfo here. I have always kept quiet when I would see threads that I didn't agree with.It's not my place to disagree with others views. I can NOT do that with this topic. I don't care what people say about me. I don't care if I'm labeled an alarmist.This is serious and has the POTENTIAL for being devastating. Also why don't you look up the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic. People need to become informed and then make their decisions based on what is known."
"Wouldn't it be great if everyone stopped non essential travel like authorities want --- don't you think that would be the fastest, the most effective, and greatest way to stop the spread?Then we all can get back to normal travel if we all acted together and quickly.We all want it to blow over and that seems the fastest way to do it.Keeping travellers coming and going is a good way to keep it spreading. Stopping travel at one time altogether as much as possible is a good idea to cut off the bugs means of transport to other countries.The bigger and faster the travel ban, the quicker all can return to normal!I say hit it hard and fast now so this bug does not cause any more damage to people and economies.Oooo I still have my Forest Gump on vhs, I have to get it on dvd so I can watch it again."
"PS: We think it's really cool to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.Please don't condem or mock those travellers who are trying to follow authorities' advice and who are trying to help people and the economy by being part of the ban/solution, which is cutting off the bugs spread."
"Thanks for restoring my faith in the fact there are still people with common sense on here,I know TA is here to garner info on resorts and weather etc, but I had to post because of the ""Run Forest Run"" attitude,and so I (we) hope we have convienced some of you to think about your safety and your family, I too am one of those that love the vacations I go on every year(sometimes twice),But I always practice safe--travel,lol"
"sooner gal, we have plans for an October vacation, we always buy the ""cancel for any reason"" insurance. Sounds like that is what you had. Was it any problem to cancel? do you have vouchers or cash back? Thanks, we booked through Northwest vacations"
"I have a solution for the foolish people who still want to vacation in Mexico ""quarantine them upon return"" since the symptoms take 48 hours, there is no way to detect if someone is contagious or not, therefore, they should not be allowed back into the streets until then."
"Milk55,Believe it or not, we had NO travel insurance. We are booked through WorryFree Vacations and they are offering an option where if you still have one month before departure time you only lose your deposit and get the rest back in cash. Our deposit was $200 per booking, but we had booked a vacation for my step daughter and her husband as well, so we lost on their booking too. After the one month, we would lose $500 per booking, and a while after that, we'd lose it all. WorryFree is an affiliate of MLT and I think Northwest Vacations is too and they offered to tranfer our monies to rebook a different destination through Northwest. We would rather just cancel, take our loss, and then hope that it blows over and we can reinvest the money we get back to go a little later. The way we look at it, it is only going to get cheaper now, and we might actually save money by rebooking later, PLUS we don't have to risk it! Check it out...unless you are scheduled to leave immediately I would think you could get the majority of your money back. Good Luck!"
