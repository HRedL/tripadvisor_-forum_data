"My family has flights, car, hotels, etc booked for our trip to Ireland on July 13-27. What is everyone's thoughts on that actually happening? Tring to take it a day at a time but my gut tells me it's probably not going to happen."
"Even if restrictions are relaxed, I can’t see them fully lifted at that stage. I suspect we still won’t have “normal life” back by then unfortunately. It really is anyone’s guess however."
"I don't see it happening...I hope you are not locked in, did you take out travel insurance?"
"Unless you bought “cancel for any reason” insurance is useless in this situation. I have a trip in May I haven’t canceled yet. I booked my flight through Fareboom on American Airlines and AA is not charging change fees but Fareboom is holding tight with their $400.00 per person penalty. That a chunk for us 5 and hard to swallow since we are probably 99,9% not going to travel in May."
Think it might be wise to follow your gut on this one.
I haven't yet cancelled September but will if needed.
"kelly, I think your gut is giving you good advice. I don't think much will have changed for international travel by July. No one, even the airlines and governments, know at this stage what the reality will be, but everyone will be afraid of further spikes in the number of cases whenever lockdowns are relaxed.So even if it's possible to travel to Ireland, it may not be possible to get home again."
"Kelly, I would wait before you do anything. But what I would do is to check on the cancellation policies for flights, accommodations, and any other reservations. Better to know now what the policies are than to find out later."
"I also have a trip planned in July. I am really bummed. I am not cancelling, but will wait and see what happens. My flights are on Delta and right now they are still valid. They have only waived change/cancellation fees thru May 31 travel. So I feel they will probably keep extending it if they need to.Also I have 3 AirBNBs booked in Galway/Mayo. I think AirBNB is giving refunds. Not entirely sure, but I will cancel those before I go if the trip is not happening. Looks like from their website I will get a refund/credit. I have a car reserved as well but can cancel that before the trip and not pay. So I think I am OK to wait and see.My husband thinks I am jumping the gun getting bummed out about not going, But i keep checking tripadvisor and most people on the forums are saying no travel at all in 2020. 3 months is still a while away so will take a wait and see approach and not get my hopes up. I was just so excited and really dont want to wait another year to go. but if i have to, i have to."
"VT_Traveler, you're right to wait and see but to be honest I don't think it's going to be 100% safe to travel in summer. The situation might be better in three months time but we just don't know. Even if it were I think I'd be reluctant to travel during the summer, not even to go and visit my mother who is in a nursing home in another country.I'm so sorry that your hopes of a holiday in Ireland might be dashed but unfortunately that's the way it is. Let's be optimistic and hope that 2021 will be a wonderful year for all!"
"I’d be willing to take the chance I guess. I’m young enough that not in the high risk category and my daughter is only 14. We both rarely get sick and I’m going to be in rural areas most of the time. Driving in our own vehicle. But yes, will be monitoring the situation for sure. I did buy trip insurance back in October so..."
"There are 'insurance experts' on these threads giving false and condescending answers. Check your own policy and get proper advice as suggested by Oma.Edited: 2:56 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"We have a trip planned to celebrate our 25th anniversary for mid September. Honestly I think the chances are slim that it will happen, just don't think it's realistic that things will have returned to normal by then.Have been holding off on airline tickets, just monitor the flight we want daily (and no one is buying tickets). And we will not be out any monies on any lodgings we have booked.Starting to think spring of 2021 will be a realistic target date. And so our first trip will be to celebrate our 26th anniversary."
"These are very difficult times. I'm not booking anything at the moment, and I don't expect to travel internationally at any time this year. Even if it's possible, I don't want to.One of the problems that I foresee is that people who aren't sick, and have no symptoms, might be carriers and spreading the virus to others who are in more vulnerable groups.That's why I think that even if international travel is allowed, it's going to be heavily restricted for the foreseeable future."
"We canceled our July trip to Ireland. The main event we were going for was canceled. Fortunately we hadn't bought airline tickets yet. (VT Traveler, I have a fall foliage trip booked to Vermont and I hope for all our sakes that will be feasible by then!)"
"It's nice that VT traveller is willing to take a chance, just driving round rural areas.Not so nice for those of us living here, I can't even walk into Dingle town, and people in Dublin registered cars are being treated as lepers and turned back."
"Fuchsia - all I'm saying is that if my flights arent cancelled AND things are open, I'll go. I'm not going to go if everything is shut down and they are still saying to maintain distance and people cant leave their houses, and restaurants are closed. That would be crazy! But its 3 months from now and I'm not going to say I am cancelling 3 months in advance when we have no idea what it will be like in 3 months.Edited: 8:14 am, April 04, 2020 "
I presume these D reg cars are owned by local people and the Gardaí are checking most non-local reg nos? If they are not local they should be turned back.
NYYVA - Hopefully you will be able to come up to VT for foliage season. It really is beautiful and I'm sure restaurants and inns will want the business if its safe to travel by then.
"Those D-registered cars that have been seen in and around the Dingle area could well be Dublin-based owners visiting and staying at their holiday homes. I may be wrong on that but we've seen a few out our way too despite the current restrictions on unnecessary travel. July is a still a few months away and from all the commentary on the radio it seems the entire situation will not be totally normalised until a vaccination is tested and approved. That doesn't mean you won't be able to travel in July. There's many a business here desperate for the cash. We'll wait and see and you'll certainly not be competing with the crowds if you make it over. It's surreal at the minute. In my honest opinion, RTE Radio 1 is your best source for the most up-to-date information. Mary Wilson on Drivetime at 4.30 pm and Today with Sean O' Rourke at 10 am are unrivalled. https://www.rte.ie/radio1/"
"I know that thinking about, and planning for possibly a once in a lifetime vacation, is a great diversion from the daily dismal statistics we are bombarded with.However I'm realizing that with all the dangers the first responders and healthcare personnel here in the US, and elsewhere, are facing on a daily basis. As well as the staggering loss of life, my concern as to whether my vacation comes off as scheduled is almost shameful.There is always next year, so for now my thoughts and prayers are with all those healthcare professionals around the globe searching for a vaccine and providing for those with the virus. God bless you all."
We were booked for April 16-30...got airline vouchers for fees/ miles used but pre paid upgraded seats on Air Lingus and United appear to be non refundable? We were to celebrate our 10th anniversary and considered rebooking in Sept but just decided to forget it and going with same dates April 2021. Hoping...
If it is true that Dublin based holiday home owners (or any holiday home owners from other counties) are there then they are in breach of government instructions and should be dealt with by the Gardaí. The selfishness of people never ceases to amaze me.
"I will wait and see July for September. At the moment I am in lockdown where I live only allowed out for my essential retail job, once a day exercise or grocery shopping but advised only once a week"
