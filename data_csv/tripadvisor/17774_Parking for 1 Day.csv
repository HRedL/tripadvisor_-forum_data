"Hello,Myself and my family have planned a trip to California for June. We will be flying from Las Vegas to SFO and will spend the day in the city before driving onto Santa Cruz. We have visited before and know we would like be based around Lombard Street/Fishermans Wharf. Should I prepay/prebook parking? If so best place to organise this? Thank you"
Well you could look at spothero or parkwhiz as long as you know where to park Warning You will have luggage in your car. Read our top questions on cars and the break in epidemic in SFLeave Nothing in the car that is visible
"There is also a great website or app called Park Me. You don't have to prepay to find decent parking. Most garages will have available parking. I know for sure there is a big lot across the street from Pier 39/Fishermans Wharf. There is also an open air parking lot behind Boudin (170 Jefferson St, San Francisco, CA 94111). With all the foot traffic on all sides, I would feel more comfortable leaving items in a locked trunk here. But as belomiser said, be mindful of car break-ins."
Thank you for your replies and suggestions. We will take all valuables with us for the day and just leave clothes in the boot out of sight. I hadn't realised it was such a problem. When we stayed 4 years ago the car stayed in the hotel carpark without a problem. Maybe I will contact the same hotel and see if they will offer us parking for the day.
"fishermans walf has one of the most expensive parking in city ,I would use the car,drive around golden gate park,then presidio,then up twin peaks,,dolorus park has nice views,drive over golden gate bridge to Sausalito try and vist muir woods but parking is restrickted and the make you pay for shuttles,drive down Lombard crooked treet,and up grant st in china town"
