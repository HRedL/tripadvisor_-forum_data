https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2020/0â€¦There is a section that is specific to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and what they are doing to date for the coronavirus outbreak
"For the ones who charge admission, I expect we all know why they have to get permission for partial or complete shutdowns."
"Just so long as they don't ""close the parks indefinitely"" like has happened during some of the government shutdowns.Our national parks, like GSMNP and other natural areas, are our ""haven from the insanity"" of this craziness, and there's no reason the trails, woods, and other natural areas should be off limits!!"
