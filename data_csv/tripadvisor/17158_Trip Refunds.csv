"We had a trip planned for Italy but mostly Rome, we are going to cancel our Airbnb, Tours and drivers, are we entitled to refunds. The Tour guide already said we can only have a credit and my Airbnb host offered 20%in Italy what is the general rulethanks"
"Airbnb places all have clearly defined cancellation policies. We’re you asking for special additional consideration? There would also have been cancellation advice on your other purchases. Not a question of general rules. It’s a pain, but most of the pain is felt by those in the hospitality industry, from the most junior up. And others I read in the Guardian COVID-19 just now of a zero hours casual driver in the UK simply told not to come to work after he reported that a customer to whom he made a delivery said she had been tested positive."
"Yeah there is no set rule.Each will depend on the policy which you agreed to when booking.It is up to the individual owner what to offer.Right now I expect you will get whatever the set terms are.If there was more of an emergency (not travel alert) to the place you are going, you might get more sympathy from the owner/operator.For example a business in Milan for a trip next week is probably more understanding than one in Rome for a trip in June for multiple reasons.Edited: 3:45 pm, February 28, 2020 "
You are not in a good negotiating position because you are not in their country and are unable to take advantage of any judicial or other means of resolution otherwise available. Especially with Airbnb. If you have proof your original airbnb agreement provided for greater refund than you are being offered then take it up with Airbnb HQ. Otherwise. I would just forget about it and consider it a lesson learned.

"shay, there is an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Monday so why not wait till then to cancel, if the official advice is not to travel to Italy you may be able to clam money back via your travel insurance.mesh"
thanks I really appreciate this
"The U.K. FCO is currently only advising against travelling to 5 small villages in northern Italy. Should that change to include Rome you may be covered by your travel insurance. If not, it will depend on each places cancellation policy.Edited: 6:31 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Also check with your credit card company as many provide travel insurance benefits. If a stronger travel advisory is put into place for Italy (or something else happens like airlines begin cancelling flights from the UK to Italy, your credit card company might cover a portion of these costs.We have a trip planned in the fall, so we're currently just waiting patiently to see how this plays out."

"We canceled our trip to Italy last week and were able to get a refund for the nonrefundable rate we paid for a hotel in San Marino, the hotel in Cinque Terre did not charge us the one night cancellation fee since we were already within 90 days. And the airlines returned the miles to our account without charging us the fee and refunded all taxes paid.This is not a change of mind cancellation. They should be understanding. It's not just about the concern of getting infected, but also not being able to return to your country and/or being quarantined. Give it a try and see what they say. If they refuse, do let the rest of us know by doing a review. This way others will find out what they will face if they deal with this hotel in the future and something like this comes up. Good Luck!Edited: 6:14 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Lots of good advice above. I'd also hold firm in your position to see if UK government advice is changed to the whole of Italy, as the USA did yesterday. We have flights to another European country paid for but won't be using them,even though the number of cases are currently very small there. half expecting a flight cancellation which should result in automatic refund. But if not, it's our decision so won't grumble. Good luck with it all, and yes, please do update us."
"""This is not a change of mind cancellation. They should be understanding.""Also guests should be understanding that AirBnB hosts have their right to apply their own policy as for cancellation. If If the situation in Italy has been described abroad a scaremongering way, it is no fault of AirBnB hosts, and it is no valid reason to cancel an agreement and to be free from consequences."
"Except it's not scaremongering. That's your assessment and it isn't supported by facts. This C.D.C. risk level map shows the advice citizens of the USA are advised to follow, for example. https:/…coronavirus-maps.htmlI agree that there needs to be understanding on all sides. You might start by not looking outwards in an attempt to blames others for this unfortunate situation. It's a shared problem that requires a shared response."
"This is a real threat. Also, it could be a problem to return after visiting a country that has several cases. So far several people have contracted this virus from people that have been to Italy. Both sides have something to lose, the owners will lose money and the travelers will lose the chance to go on vacation. Neither one of us is at fault. For this reason, cancellation policies should be flexible. We are thankful that the hotels we dealt with were understanding. We will definitely rebook this trip, when possible, and we will choose the same properties and will highly recommend them."
"Closing 12 towns is a serious situation, the news are reporting what is happening in your country. https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…""Italians refused to go to Chinese restaurants and shops when the virus first emerged. Now they are being shunned worldwide. The stigma is spreading faster than the virus itself"" The Daily Beast""Chinese targeted as Italian panic"" https:/…world-europe-51370822And we're scaremongering?"
"Thank you for posting your experience. My husband and I are scheduled for a cruise with several stops in Italy, ending in Rome. I am calling the travel agent tomorrow to see about cancelling. I am not worried about getting sick, but about the repercussions when return to the US. We do not have time to be quarantined, so it is not worth the risk to us."
"I'm traveling the first week of April and I'm having a hard time getting refunds. The bigger issue is going there and while being there, the situation gets worse, the US may not even allow you to renter. Now you have to be quarantined for additonal days and that now becomes and undue borden on your family, employment, and financially.Edited: 12:11 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"We are traveling in Italy for a month starting in April. We booked 3 vacation rentals thru trip advisor. The final payment is due this week. Our hosts are playing hardball and referring us to their ""flexible"" cancellation policy of 50% back ""IF"" you pay full amount when due.so we could cancel today and lose over $1,000 or pay up and lose more. Some choice? Well despite people saying you can't contact trip advisor by phone indeed you can and we did. They were helpful and delayed automatic payment of final amount by 10 days which gives us a little breathing room and some stress relief.My advise would be not to cancel unless you have no choice? I offered our hosts to forgo final payment until a couple of days before arrival should we be allowed to travel. That mitigates the potential loss to us both as it's unlikely that they would be able to re rent?"
""""" If they refuse, do let the rest of us know by doing a review. This way others will find out what they will face if they deal with this hotel in the future and something like this comes up""""So are you suggesting that others boycott the AirBnB owner, who may rely on that rental for their entire income or a substantial amount, a bad review for adhering to their own cancellation policies for a situation which is completely out of their control?This is a bad situation for everyone but let's not make it worse for innkeepers in the future for a problem that is effecting everyone."
"Like Gary B, we negotiated cancellation policies with one of our hotels. We're not travelling until May and want to wait as long as possible to see if things will improve before cancelling. One of our hotels has a 30 day cancellation policy. I emailed them and explained our situation and they were willing to change it to a 14 day cancellation policy. I did not threaten them with a bad review, though. I assume that they were willing to make an exception for us since booking are down and they are not likely to fill the room if I cancel.Edited: 3:52 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"I was going to Sicily in three weeks but after dealing with Turkish air related to two employees that were to leaving tomorrow with no guarantee of return flight I started cancelling my trip. One hotel in Syracuse refused refund or credit. I explained about the airline , they suggested getting different airline. I thought under the circumstances at least a credit for future trip would be reasonable. But NO"
"There are no travel warnings about Sicily so it makes sense that the hotel/B&B is not willing to give you a refund for a non-refundable purchase. I'm sure if things change they will adjust their policy but I don't think it's reasonable to ask a hotel to cancel that close to the date when there, technically, is no reason to. I would check into other flights or wait to see if there are any strong warnings for Sicily. donna"
"I agree with dbabe. You must have known the T&Cs when you booked. If there are no reasons not to go to Sicily , then I don’t see why the B&B should be expect3d to give you a refund. At the end of the day, they are a business, not a charity organisation."
"It's difficult for everyone, especially the host where people book. Some empathy appropriate. Also note that if you actually do travel, you will spend a lot more money! Money you won't spend if you don't travel. Put that in equation.Cruise question earlier. I have to declare that we have never been interested in cruises. But right now, a cruise?https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/coro…"
"New from Rome. 43 yrs old priest infected with the virus. Church shuts down.""People walk past the St. Louis of the French church in Rome, Sunday, March 1, 2020. The French community church in Rome, St. Louis of the French, closed its doors to the public on Sunday, reportedly after a priest was infected with a new virus. The church in the historic center of Rome is famous for three paintings by the Baroque master Caravaggio, and is a tourist draw. A sign on the door Sunday noted in French that the church had been closed as a precaution by the French Embassy for both Masses and touristic visits until further notice"".

"FredTheCatTravels said: ""So are you suggesting that others boycott the AirBnB owner, who may rely on that rental for their entire income or a substantial amount, a bad review for adhering to their own cancellation policies for a situation which is completely out of their control?""People save money to travel and some have spent a long time saving. This is a situation completely out of their control as well. It's only fair since the traveler did not make the decision based on a situation they could control. I have the list of all the hotels that worked with us when we called to cancel our trip in May. You can be sure that we will book with them as soon as we can go to Italy and we will recommend them to everyone we come in contact with that will be traveling to Italy in the future."
"I am the owner of a vacation rental in Rome, listed on VRBO, AirBnB, etc. I am posting this in the hope it will help answer some questions people may be having about a cancellation.I can tell you that owners can have different cancellation policies, so you need to go back and review what were the specific terms and conditions that you agreed to when you booked the apartment or villa (you should be able to access this on the VRBO or AirBnB website). Obviously, it also matters how long it is before your stay, as there will most probably be key dates (for example, there might be a full refund at least 60 days before the stay, but you might lose what you have paid to date if less than 30 days before the stay). But again, check the terms and conditions.If the owner does not have to give you a refund, they may be willing to allow you to change your stay to a later date, that is, to not give you a refund but instead give you a credit for a later date. But, that may be at the discretion of the owner.Even if the owner agrees to a cancellation, the owner may need the renter to initiate the cancellation request on the VRBO or other systems. This is because if the owner ""made"" the cancellation the owner might be liable for credit card or other fees and/or the owner might experience a negative repercussion. For example, VRBO penalizes an owner who cancels on a guest by lowering the property's ranking. So, be prepared to initiate a cancellation through the booking system and you may well need to get on the phone (with VRBO, AirBnB, etc.) as well to try and get the situation resolved, even if the owner agrees to a cancellation.I hope this information helps!"
"my tour company has agreed to refund me they said it would take a few weeks, but they have a good reputation and I used them before. My airbnb host has already sent a refund. Ryanair wont of course."
I wouldn’t expect *any* airline to refund the flight cost if you are the one cancelling...Different situation if *they* cancel the flight.
"I used VRBO for the first time for a Sorrento apartment called Casa Pina. As the cancellation refund deadline approached, I emailed the manager if I could have a week’s extension in order to decide. She confirmed an extra week. When I cancelled four days later, she refused a refund!VRBO is refusing any assistance since it was “a personal agreement” between me and the manager.Is this normal behavior from VRBO? Anyone have advice on what I can do?"
"At the moment Sorrento isn’t on lockdown, so wait and see. If it does become a no go area it should be covered by travel insurance. Read the policy T&Cs."
"""VRBO is refusing any assistance since it was “a personal agreement” between me and the manager."". reading this, it seams that you communicated outside VRBO via personal email of owner,in this case of course they don't have to hold responsibility for the owner actions ,as they worn in the rules all must be done via their booking site"
Walks of Italy refused to refund money for a tour that we cancelled well within the required time period. I disputed the charge with my credit card company and they took care of it.
Glad to hear that your credit card company has resolved the problem.
"Of all the businesses I’ve dealt with, VRBO was by far the easiest to deal with in obtaining refunds. I’m also grateful to the Best Western Ai Cavilieri in Palermo for giving me a refund despite it be non-refundable, Air Transat is the worst. Refusing to refund even though they were the ones to cancel the flights."
"Norwegian Air came through with a refund; Alitalia has promised one, though may take months more. Hilton promises a refund, even though our booking was nonrefundable. Let’s patronize those companies. The only places I couldn’t get refunds we’re a small guesthouse in Trastevere where I booked a non refundable room, (run by two sisters living pretty close to the bone, so I felt for them,) and Walks of Italy, as previously mentioned, (for whom I feel nothing good.)"
"I also have flights booked on Alitalia in July between Rome and Sicily. I hope they get cancelled so that I can get refunds. What are the odds? If not, I’ll try through my credit card insurance."
