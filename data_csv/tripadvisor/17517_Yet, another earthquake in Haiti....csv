"This was early thsi morning, when another 6.2 earthqueke was registered at 56 km west of Puerto Principe....Many buildings that had survived the first one, were collapsed....It was defenetelly not felt in the Dominican Republic, and everything here is ""normal""."
Local news In Chicago lL. said it was a 6.0 and didn't say a thing about damage to any structures.Edited: 10 years ago 
The shocks are moving westward. The Caymen Islands had a 5.8 quake this morning.
"Please, please, please forward your opinions on what I should do. My husband and I are scheduled to leave for PC tomorrow morning. I am EXTREMELY anxious in light of the 2 earthquakes in Haiti during the past week and the earthquake in Grand Caymans yesterday. We are coming on an Anniversary trip and leaving our 4 daughters at home. I am sooooo nervous about something horrible happening to us while we are in PC. My husband is insisting that we keep our travel plans in place. I know that this might sound ridiculous to all but I am afraid that I will be worrying the whole time that I am there about an earthquake or a tsunami hiting PC and never being able to see my precious daughters again. Am I CRAZY? What should I do????? Please help!!!!"
This earthquake happened at 6:03:44AM.Magnitude - 6.1Depth - 6.2 milesDistance - 35 miles WSW of Port-Au-Prince
livinginNJ. Before we left Canada we registered with the Canadian Embassy. We were in Punta Cana when the Haiti earthquake hit. We were immediately contacted by the Canadian Embassy via email advising us that we were in no danger and they gave us a detailed description of the effects of the earthquake. We did this the day before we left and I am sure that your United States government would have a similar program to that in Canada. Best of luck!
The after shocks are moving WESTWARD. Punta Cana is well EAST of the shocks. IE: DR is getting further and further away from any problem. I sure wouldn't be cancelling my trip. If anyone feels compelled to do so please give me your tickets so that I can go there and take some supplies. I'm so sorry I couldn't book a trip right now or I'd be on the next flight out.
"Thanks to the OP for posting this, as I'm sure many travelers to Punta Cana are concerned. I would just like to add, to the regulars on this forum, to give those who are not a break, they are obviously scared and looking for the most info they can get on the crisis on the island. Most of us dont live there so we dont know whats going on, just from what we hear on the news and this forum. It helps to hear from locals that all is well in Punta Cana. But after reading through some of the quake topics, I think that we could do without all the ""why are people so concerned about Haiti now, they've been in poverty for years, why dont you know that?!?!"" attitude. Does it matter? We know now and obviously the whole world is doing something about it. So please just answer the questions w/o making people feel foolish for asking. Just my dos pesos."
"It was viewed live on CNN, lots of damage againEdited: 10 years ago "
"~ I'm sending blessings and well wishes to Haiti ........How sad & tragic ... ~ Count your blessings ..... and treasure your life ...ibgamblinqueen, I agree ...there is so much anger here on the board...PeaceLea"
"Living in NJ, I understand how you are feeling. We are leaving on Friday morning and staying at the Majestic Elegance. I was soooo looking forward to this vacation. After the first quake I thought it would be fine and that we would at least be contributing to helping the economy in the DR. Now, after the quake in the Grand Caymans and a second in Haiti, I am worried for our safety and I think how could I have fun and relax while in the back of my mind there will always be concerns for earthquakes or tsunmais. I am also glad to see people on TA understanding peoples concerns. That is why I visit TA for peoples opinions and concerns. Thank you and have fun whatever you decide."
"You are not crazy at all, I am in the same boat. We are scheduled to fly out on Monday and my stomach is in complete knots over this. Like your husband, everyone in my party is keen on going and states that we will be safe. I know how you feel,"
"Any reports on how this will effect the already difficult search, rescue and aide attempts? They were already having a hard enough time getting food, water and medical providers to the people in Port Au Prince."
Ibgamblingqueen. . . .well said!!!!Cat
HiI know what you are feeling because I have been a nervous wreck for the last week. I am also leaving 2 daughters and a husband at home and i'm leaving with my aunt for a 4 days...I get comfort through reading some reviews on this forum and it makes me feel good knowing everything is the same in punta cana but I think part of me will still be a bit scare when I'll be there..find it also hard to be there having fun while some people are in big misery about 400 km away... anyway we are leaving friday morning from Montreal ...hope everything will be alright for you also ...have a good tripMelanie
"Melanie,Don't feel bad - you've earned the vacation. You will do more good then bad going. There is lots of people suffering around the world and if you worried about all of them you might as well committ suicide."
So true ...thanks AnyBMelanie
"Are there many Haitians fleeing to DR? What are the medical conditions in DR? As a traveller, would I be able to get appropriate care if necessary given the number of Haitians being treated? For the cost of the trip, it seems more appropriate to switch locations to avoid any travel inconveniences at this time. Please advise!"
"Ibgamblingqueen, I agree wholeheartedly with you!"
Mikedavid ....Nice to read you ....PeaceLea
My wife and I leave in the morning for PC and it is very concerning for us as well. I have been checking message boards here since the first quake and after the one in GC and now again in Haiti it makes me very uneasy. I know that 400km is a long distance but it is all on the same island. Just to be clear... there have been no reports of any problems in PC at all? Thanks for the feedback.
"texanIllinois, we're defininitely considering another destination because of the Haitians fleeing in to DR. We figure supplies to resorts will be held up, delays in flights will happen and the situation you mentioned about medical care. I feel bad for the people who were hurt in the earth quake but, it doesn't look like a good time to be travelling to that area. Disasters happen every day some place in the world but, that doesn't mean that we have to put ourselves in the middle of it if we can go some place else."
Knowing the way CNN works that was probably file tape. I hate that station.
Buenos Dias Monica!So sad to read this. I've not seen tv for a bit and reading this is sad!I keep them and their families world wide in my prayers and heart.hugs to you dearbb/mt
"Thanks for your reply. I have been all over the board about whether to go or not. My travel agent, who booked my vacation through apple, is trying to alleviate my concerns, but my family would like me to change for my own peace of mind. It seems to me that apple would be doing something or the prices would drop significantly. I am really glad that I bought trip insurance this time!"
The quakes are not even felt in the Dominican let alone in Punta Cana. I'll be there Saturday for 2 weeks. I expect more room on the beach if you decide to stay home.
If I were living in NY I'd have more sleepless nights there than worrying about tsunamis and earthquakes in the D.R. I find crossing busy streets and surviving more of an adventure than worrying about what if.
"I was in the DominicanRepublic last week, (Puerto Plata) when the earthquake hit Hati. We didn't even know it had happened untill some guests who had been watching TV told us about it.. I suggest you donate to Hatian Relief, then. go enjoy your vacation. We are all very fortunate people, indeed."
Thanks for this message...
"I can relate... My brother is getting married in PC in April & I was supposed to book my trip yesterday but hesitated because I was worried too (same reason, my husband and I are leaving our children home). We decided we'd go ahead with our plans and I was ready to book today, until I heard about the 2nd quake. Right now I'm feeling like as much as I love my brother and want to be at his wedding it is just too risky.It's a hard decision but your anxiety is certainly with cause...Good Luck!"
Each to their ownLook at last year with the swine flu in Mexico and all the people that cancelled holidays only to find their own countries were much badly effected laterWe had to cancel because we could not get a flight but went as soon as we could and supported the Mexican peopleNot we all see it as a total over reaction
"I'm just not sure that 70,000 plus people dying is comparable to the swine flu ""epidemic"" but I see your point. That being said I have made the choice to pass on the risk."
"we are leaving in 21 hours for bavaro princess and cant wait to tip more then ever ,and donate at the drop boxes. the worst thing you could do to help them is not go they need our money now more then ever"
Im just hopeing that when me and my gf go in april everything is ok we booked that wild card 5 star thing with go travel
"larry37,I agree that we should continue with our PC travel plans, and donate wherever we can !Have a fantastic vacation !!!Sheryl"
that's not what the news channel here in Punta Cana reported.they reported a 6.1 afterquake which lasted only 10 seconds and did not damage any further building which survived the real quake a week ago.no additional casualties.ZZZZaaappp!!! .....Mike
"We're leaving for Punta Cana on Friday morning and I really am not afraid. I feel so badly for the Hatian people and find the DR residents such kind and friendly people....we enjoy tipping them with the hopes that it will help them.We will go without fear, knowing that our destinies are at all times in the hand of our loving and all knowing God. It doesn't matter where we are when HE decides that our time is up, and I know that when I do die, I'll be going straight to heaven because I have put my trust in Jesus! Peace and love to all. Put your trust in Jesus and you will never have to be afraid again.Edited: 10 years ago "
We are also from Saskatoon and also traveling to PC in early Feb. Can you please tell me how you registered with the Canadian Embassy? Sounds like a smart thing to do.
