"Good day Colorado. We are loosely planning a trip to Hawaii next year. In my boredom, I am frequently looking at that forum. I noticed a discussion about VRBO's being illegal now (with Covid and all) and that the only lodging that can be open are hotels. I think this runs through September of this year.We have a trip in July to CS to spend some time with family. I have a VRBO rented for our time there, and when I saw the post for Hawaii, I was concerned that this could be an issue elsewhere. Does anyone know if this is the case in CS? Our time is mid July for 5 nights. ThanksI appreciate the helpL"
I looked at the visit CO Springs Covid-19 official website and didn't see anything that addressed your situation. https:/…
"Thanks SusieLou, I didn't see anything either.Appreciate the link. It will be helpful in the next 8 weeks or so. L"
"I'm here in CS We are renting out our VRBO home. No issues, just spacing groups further apart."
"thanks Springschick, by spacing groups further apart, does that mean the house is sitting empty longer in between guest? Some states (Hawaii and Maine for sure) have mandatory 14 day quarantine. Doesn't look like Colorado has that. I really appreciate any input. I have only rented on VRBO one other time, and honesty it causes a bit of concern about cancellation policies and such. Also a bigger risk at this time in our lives.Thanks againL"
"We are not mandated to have the house empty for any length of time, so you would need to ask the owner about the disinfecting policies they have in place.As for cancellations, most owners adhere to what you signed in your contract. Especially now, since we have all been aware of the pandemic for a couple of months.Airbnb & VRBO differ in this regard.Airbnb just laid off 25% of it's staff.You should definitely call your host if you have any questions or concerns.My neighbor just left a week ago to return to their farm in NC. They said the hotel they found in KC required 3 days in between guests. Hopefully, I've been somewhat helpful.Edited: 8:50 am, May 09, 2020 "
"My concern would be the cleaning. I'm a loyalty member of Marriott and stay there frequently. I get their newsletter about how they steam clean rooms and all of their check in policies, etc. I don't clean my own house as well as they clean the hotel rooms. So, who cleans the place you are renting???"
"Through May 26, there is a prohibition against vacation home rentals everywhere in Colorado by the State of Colorado as explained below. You will need to continue to follow any public health orders issued by the state or if more restrictive, orders from the county or city.State Public Health Order Prohibits Vacation Home Rental OperationsLarimer County, CO --- After reaching out to the State of Colorado early this week, Larimer County Department of Health and Environment and the Town of Estes Park received clarification today from the State that its Public Health Order 20-28 ""Safer at Home"" prohibits the operation of Vacation Home Rentals for the duration of the order, April 27 through May 26. The reference is on page 27 of the order at https:/…viewavailable via https://covid19.colorado.gov/safer-at-homeUnder the state order, guests at vacation rental homes in the Estes Valley, and everywhere in Colorado, may not be accepted through May 26. Questions and concerns should be directed to the State using the form at https://covid19.colorado.gov/CovidConcerns"
"I think the OP is trying to figure out if she should go ahead with the reservation or cancel. Every vrbo owner chooses for themselves what their cancellation contract entails. My guess is hers will be refunded totally if she cancels before 60 days.Taking in to everything mentioned above, it's still an individual decision.Also, on another note, things seem to be a bit more lax in El Paso County.On Pikes Peak website,it states you can drive your mom up on Mother's Day. I think I read Mt. Evan's will not be open until after Memorial weekend.Garden of the Gods, Mueller State Park, Florrissant Fossil Bed, North Cheyenne Canon Park, Red Rocks Open Space are all open minus the visitor center.Royal Gorge is offering a $20/ carload fee to drive over the bridge.Cheyenne Mt Zoo is opening before Memorial (outside areas).So it feels like it is less restrictive in our area than the rest of Colorado.We have not had a single renter in our house since March 4th. We are opening back up in July. 1/2 have cancelled. Are we surprised? Not at all.Edited: 12:46 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"State of Colorado orders apply throughout the state in every county and municipality. County or municipal orders cannot override the state orders unless the county/municipal orders are more restrictive (not more lax) than the state orders. Currently, the state order prohibiting vacation home rentals everywhere in Colorado only goes through May 26. As the situation with coronavirus evolves, orders will change. The OP just needs to be aware."
"This from the US Forest Service concerning Mt. Evans - ""DELAYED OPENING: Due to the risks associated with COVID-19, Mount Evans Highway (Colorado Highway 5) will not open until at least early July due to delays related to COVID-19 and public health orders. Depending on the current situation, weather conditions and snow removal this timeline could change again.""https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/detail/!ut/p/z0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zijQwgwNHCwN_DI8zPyBcqYKBfkO2oCABZcx5g/?position=Not%20Yet%20Determined.Html&pname=Arapaho&ss=110210&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&pnavid=null&navid=170000000000000&ttype=detail&cid=fsm91_058388Our county, Mesa, had to apply for special permit to open up more based on the low numbers of covid-19 cases. There are still restrictions. It does not appear that El Paso County has received that permit and are still in the state requirement safer-at-home order.https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/news/news…"
"Yes, thanks for that. I do understand the order.Because of our heavy military influence here in the Springs, we really never shut down like most towns.All military (Air Force, Army, Space Force, NORAD, Peterson) are deemed essential and are NOT working from home. We slowed a little, but not like everyone else.CS will decide May 15th if we will have 4th of July displays.Obviously, we still can't congregate in big groups.Our tourism along with everyone else in the state is doomed for this upcoming season. We were suppose to launch our new Olympic Museum this spring. Talk about bad timing. I will continue to be the ""boots on the ground"" here in CS."
"Good morning and thanks so much for all of the replies. Yes, I'm trying to find out (as much as I can) if I should keep our reservations. I have a 6/11 cancelation date (which is 30 days), so that gives me another 30 days to see what happens. I appreciate all the responses and have read them all. I will keep the links handy to see what changes occur in the next month.I guess I will reach out to the owner and ask about cleaning procedures. I really appreciate all of your responses.Happy Mother's day to allL"
"Today the CO Dept. of Tourism officially came out and said that they are not encouraging out of state tourists. https://www.colorado.com/letsco I know we are all getting tired of the same old same old but getting into new places is not the answer, imho."
"SusieLou. thanks so much for your post. I might be missing something, as I don't see that information on the link that your provided. It has a lot of smiling faces encouraging travel. Thanks L"
While you're Waiting. Not coming.
Thank you. L
"At this link under Impact on Colorado Travel Industry, the campaign is explained.https://industry.colorado.com/what-know-abou…""A return to 'business as usual' will take time. It's not like flipping an off/on switch. If we reverse course too rapidly, the virus will come roaring back. More people will get sick, more will die, and hospitals in Colorado won't be able to take care of them all. It's more like a dimmer switch. We need to prepare for the long haul and slowly turn the dial brigher so we can get ourselves and our economy back on track safely."" ""The Colorado Tourism Office launched its first-ever campaign designed not to attract visitors to the state but rather keep them pining for Colorado from the safety of their homes. The Let's Colorado or Let's CO! campaign uses Colorado as a verb, encompassing all of the quintessential activities residents and visitors alike associate with their state.""""The first phase of the campaign, Waiting to CO!, is designed to keep Colorado top of mind while residents and visitors are unable to travel freely through the state."""
I saw an article that talks about cleanliness of VRBOs and Airbnbs. It has some good points to consider.https://www.today.com/health/it-safe-rent-ai…
Thank you very much. Some very useful information. L
"Hello. I saw your post on the Colorado Springs forum. Myself and my family will be traveling to CS in August for my niece's wedding. Is your VRBO available? Are you able to direct me to information for it on the VRBO website? I appreciate your Airbnb info. I think I would rather avoid booking with them. Thank you, Pam Campbell Cary, NC"
"Pam, welcome to tripadvisor. I want to give you a tip on how to directly contact the person you are wanting to ask a question. Click on their avatar (name under their photo) and it will take you to their profile. That page has a place where you can then send a message through tripadvisor that maintains your anonymity and theirs. If they choose to respond to you through tripadvisor then you will get an email from tripadvisor letting you know that you have a message. We try to limit the amount of personal info we put out here - like your full name, town you live in, and when you'll be gone to a wedding in another state. Some stuff someone wanting to burglarize your home or business would want to know.You can delete your post, which is what I suggest. Hope this all works out well for you."
"Pam, it would be a violation of TripAdvisor's private messaging and content policies for any person on TripAdvisor to tell you which vacation rental property they own. That would be considered commercial content and advertising or solicitation.https:/…360008136233-Guidelines-for-Messageshttps:/…360008133913"
