"Hi all,I booked a flight with Travelgenio back in December, to travel in May.All went well until the airline cancelled the reservation. This was on 15MAR and since then I have been trying to contact Travelgenio but they are not replying to emails and not taking calls.Does anyone know how can I reach them to request my refund?Thank you"
Scroll down to any of the other thirty threads about this company. You will see replies from TG that might help
"Travelgenio is based in Spain, and that country is in total lockdown. It is very unlikely that there are more than a very few staff on duty - possibly none."
"Thanks for the suggestions, I have tried all possible emails posted on here.I understand Spain is on lockdown, so am I and with actual curfew, we are all working from home and this is no excuse to not reply one single message since over 3 weeks ago.We are all under pressure, I need my refund to get through the crisis too. Travelgenio please help."
"You have to wait until the airline makes a refund o Travelgenio, and then Travelgenio will extract its refund fee and pass the rest on to you.In the current circumstances, a reasonable expectation would be for this process to take some months. There are thousands of people wanting refunds.Edited: 3:21 am, April 06, 2020 "
I suggest that you file a chargeback with your bank for the entire amount paid. Good luck!
"Thanks Louis, that's a good advice. Since the payment was fine in December 2018, more than 60 days ago, the bank cant process the dispute.You see, we were going for our wedding in Australia. All cancelled now, but I need the refund and TG has not responded in over 3 weeks..."
Just submit all you have about the flights being cancelled. You're showing that you did not receive the service due to airline cancellation and you automatically win the dispute...
"Louis, please stop giving incorrect advice. No bank is going to process a chargeback for a payment made 16 months ago. As others have advised, the OP will have to wait for the airline to refund the money to Travelgenio, who will then refund the OP minus their fee."
"Depending on the card network used, you have 24 months to file a dispute. This is the case with MasterCard. The 60 day period is from the day the service was suppose to be received and NOT from when it is purchased.Give your bank a call about this. What do you have to lose?"

"Poster #10 please do your research before you personally attack others on a TRAVEL forum.Waiting 3 months for a refund is unreasonable and the OP has every right to be upset. Stop patronizing people please.We're going through a sensitive moment worldwide. Everyone should remain calm in the forums so that we can keep this TRAVEL forum as peaceful as possible. There is no need for the hostility some of you have towards most threads/OPs on here.Edited: 10:51 am, April 06, 2020 "
"It looks as if OP accidentally wrote December 2018 in post #6 when in fact the booking was made in December 2019. His flight was cancelled on 15 th March so why does Louis B think three months comes into the discussion? OP has already said he has been waiting only three weeks, so where is the problem? Like many thousands of others, he will have to wait for the backlog cancelled flights and refunds to be dealt with. There are no quick solutions to this mess.Edited: 4:30 am, April 06, 2020 "
"The airline cancelled on march 15, that is 3 weeks, not 3 months. It is totally reasonable to wait a couple of weeks. Especially because there is a 3rd party involved.It doesn´t help people either to keep giving incorrect advise."
"The OP is not travelling until May and Travelgenio have said they are dealing with flights that are 72hours away.OP you just have to be patient, everyone and the world wants a refund. That’s the way it is now. In any case Travelgenio will not refund you until they receive the refund from the airline. Travelgenio bought you a ticket as requested and passed your money on in good faith. They do not have your money. The refund from the airline is likely to take a long while, Travelgenio will take fees and then process it to you which also will take time. The travel industry is in meltdown and you complicated it by using a middleman. At present a chargeback will not work as Travelgenio have not breached contract. It’s perfectly reasonable that you need to wait. It’s difficult times for everyone."
Thanks Louis this is really helpful advice! I called the bank and they are processing the dispute now. I will let you know how that works.
"Hi Smuge, thanks for your opinion, I do understand that I have to wait for a refund like thousands, but in my case I called the airline and they never received the funds for this reservation.If Travelgenio would at least acknowledge the request and confirm what the plan is, I would be willing to wait 30, 60 or 90 days for the refund.Problem is that I got nothing from TG. Zero. It starts to look, to me, with all respect for the added work they may have, they are keeping my funds for no reason since the airline was never paid? It is not acceptable for a company to hide behind the pandemic and leave thousands with no answer for over 3 weeks now. We are all suffering from the pandemic. I have family that got laid off, others in hospital, I have bills to pay. I want an answer from TG PLEASE."
"Smudge is right, it’s not an opinion, I directed you to the other threads where you will see over and over that TG is dealing with flights in the order they were scheduled to fly. Your flight is still a month or so away, so patience is the only advice. They have tens of thousands of other customers ahead of you in line.I often recommend chargebacks, but that won’t work here.You might also notice, MNPT, that there are many threads here going back years and years warning you that this is a crappy company. It seems you didn’t research them before you gave them your money, and you are going to have to accept that fact. And the waiting.."
"I completely agree with the OP. They might take their time to handle your inquiry, but they should at least acknowledge it.I do think your bank will get you your full refund. The company needs to respond to your dispute, and if they do not, you get your money back by default."
"MNPT, I am confused. Did the airline cancel your ticket, or has TG never bought you the ticket? If TG never bought you the ticket, than yes, dispute it with your credit card. If the airline cancelled and you are waiting on a refund, you will have to wait."
"Hi Northern, I understand your point of how I missed to check the bad reputation of the company, but that's not solving my problem now.Hi Burge, I got a template email from TG on 15MAR saying the airline has cancelled the flight, then I called the airline Lufthansa and they said this reservation was never paid. I made the booking in December - so this is why I'm worried.Again I understand there may be a thousand cases, but 3 weeks of no response is about more than acceptable. In my company we are all working from home and with a backlog but this is beyond acceptable.Should they at least acknowledge what the plan is al- if they have one because this is really starting to look like they are keeping money from clients just like that, hiding behind no phone calls and no answers / maybe a lot of us will give up?I have initiated a dispute via bank and I'm calling an attorney. Will let u all know his that goes. My patience has expired."
"""Hiding"" - most of them are hiding at home, or have been laid off due to this. Businesses like this have either shut down completely or are working on extremely reduced staff right now. These are tough times for the companies and their customers.Now it is sounding like TG never actually booked the ticket, which is a completely different issue than if they booked it and are not refunding.MNPT, did you get confirmation from TG of the flight - like a so-called ""record locator"" with the airline?"
"I am also working from home, under hard conditions, I have family laid off, family at the hospital and bills to pay!I need and answer from TG, 3 weeks now going to 4 with zero feedback,Whichever the situation was or is. Lets not blame it on the crisis - I am living the crisis. So frustrating."
"Everyone is living the crisis. It is just not possible to shift an entire call centre onto work-at-home quickly, especially when people are not allowed out of their houses.Travelgenio gave rotten service in normal times. You should expect zero service in this crisis. Book direct with the airline next time."
"If your flight is not until May, then you're well down the queue. They are only processing requests that are within 72 hours of the flight date. Also, lockdown in Spain has been extended until at least the 26th of April."
@sidneynick I know my mistake for not checking the reputation of TG and what I should be doing next time. Your post is not helping. Thank you.
"Hi all,Just got an answer from the bank, despite the payment was done in December, the ""service"" was booked for May so they have accept the dispute and will proceed.Maybe I will get my money back, maybe not, but I'm sure I'll get some attention from TG now."
"Great. You will find a lot of noise on these forums, unfortunately. Bottom line is that you are a passenger and you have rights."
"OP, you’ve changed your story, it’s just a great Shane that you didn’t write the full facts in the original post. Your post implied that the airline cancelled the fight, so TG had bought your ticket and so all the advice given was correct.You now seem to say the story has changed and now that Travelgenio never made a booking. Completely different. Yes TG should refund, whether they are in breach your CC will investigate. Why did we all waste our time answering?I’m sorry but I get angry when posters waste time by not giving correct information. You’ve waste most people’s time by not posting the correct story in the first place."
Thank you Louis I appreciate your suggestions and support! I'll let you know if I succeeded!
smudge99 this matter is now resolved. Please stop harassing the OP.
"Couldn't add, PS I didn’t give an opinion, I gave facts based on your misinformation."
"Louis, you don’t own and police the forum. The OP needs to understand that correct needs to be given at the first post and then the correct info can be give.It is not harassment, it’s you who have also been giving incorrect information on various thread where you do not understand all EU/UK legislation. As I’ve said before I would not be answering anything to do with US legislation. The one thing I have learnt about US legislation is that 24 hour cancellations are only for direct airline bookings, no through 3rd parties. Any more than that I know no more."

Hello MNPT. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Regards. INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"""I am also working from home, under hard conditions, I have family laid off, family at the hospital and bills to pay!""I am very sorry to hear that - we don't know your or anyone's situation on this forum. You are not alone, though - many, many are like that and are facing hardship due to layoffs or family members being sick or dying.""I need and answer from TG, 3 weeks now going to 4 with zero feedback,""I have told you why that is probably not possible in the timeframe that you need and advise you to set your expectations differently.""Whichever the situation was or is. Lets not blame it on the crisis - I am living the crisis. So frustrating.""Yes we should indeed blame it on the crisis if the crisis is to blame for this, which it most certainly seems to be right now.TG do not have the staff to process the request and are prioritizing based on dates for refunds.This sounds like they never booked your ticket and in which case pursuing it with your credit card company is absolutely the best way for you to get some sort of financial resolution for this. The banks can then fight it out with TG to get THEIR money back.I hope this works out for you."
"Hi all, Finally I also had a reply from TG and they will contact me. For the record, I did not change my story: I got an email from TG saying my reservation had been cancelled by the airline, and yes I had a record locator. When I called the airline they said booking was never paid.I feel like a lot of people come to the forum to pass judgement or criticize or just being plain negative.I say, if you don't have a suggestion that can actually help it's better, why do you even bother in posting?Some of you almost made me feel like I did something wrong or that is normal to have zero feedback in over 3 weeks.All I wanted from here was a suggestion on how to solve my problem. But hey this is my first experience in fóruns and dealing with internet trolls. Stay safe everyone"

Lol thank you ;)
"Hi Mnpt. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
Hello TRAVELGENIO i just receive an email from the airline that my flight is cancelled this APRIL 15 due to covid 19 and i already contacted you thru email but i dont have received any reply from you. I wanted to have a refund for this one. Please contact me ASAP. I already send a messge to you here. I can give you my booking reference. Please reply because i really need the money to get back home. Thank you!!!
How did you contact them?
"'I got an email from TG saying my reservation had been cancelled by the airline, and yes I had a record locator. When I called the airline they said booking was never paid.' The two statements are incompatible.It is possible to have a record locator for a booking not completed, and it sounds like TG did not make the booking but only requested it - their ususal way of operating. That TG claimed the reservation had been cancelled is also their usual way to wriggle out of saying they'd not actually paid LH for the ticket.If the booking was not completed then there is nothing to be refunded from LH. TG should return the funds, and they may charge a fee for having requested the booking.Louis will come back and claim that this is wrong, but TG's terms are clear in that they will charge fees for the little effort they make. Not reading the terms does not mean the consumer is not bound by them.'Some of you almost made me feel like I did something wrong or that is normal to have zero feedback in over 3 weeks.' In this case the lack of response is completely the norm for the wretched website you've asked to act as your agent.'All I wanted from here was a suggestion on how to solve my problem. But hey this is my first experience in fóruns and dealing with internet trolls.' Dear oh dearie me."

"Travelgenio guy,Wouldn't it be easier for TG to have the courtesy of communicating with its clients directly instead of using an Air Travel forum to do so?Edited: 5:27 pm, April 06, 2020 "
<<<< Wouldn't it be easier for TG to communicate with its clients directly instead of using an Air Travel forum to do so? >>>> They're not. It's a computer 'bot'.
Hi Fave C. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"Hi all,Today I have received the refund from my bank, in result of the credit card dispute.Thanks to the person here that gave me the correct advice.Additionally, I have place a formal complaint with all the industry regulatory bodies in Portugal:- Turismo de Portugal (they can revoke their travel agency license)- Polícia Judiciária, ciber-crime (police)- ASAE (ilegal commercial activity)They may still not reply to me, but they will reply to the authorities or lose license in Portugal.They have charged me in December, not payed the airline, canceled the reservation in March and now tried to hide behind the pandemic to keep my money."
"Good news and great for you keeping your authoritiesin the loop,"
"Travelgenio is a Spanish company so why would they have, or care about, any licenses in Portugal? Does the state of Portugal have the ability to block access to web sites not in the country? Otherwise it is pointless to have Travelgenio to lose its license to operate in Portugal if it even has one."
