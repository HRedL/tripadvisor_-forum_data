For: You will have an opportunity to see cool things like sakura trees in blossom without hordes of other tourists.Against: Some/many things may be closed or you might get caught up in some trouble with international travel restrictions.Lots of opinions out there. Best for you to read and make up your own mind.
"I don't know why, but I'm surprise to see that Japan has become a safer country than the the U.S.A. with less number of infected people and total deaths by Covid-19. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"CDC in the U.S.A. included China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea, but did not include Japan, in its Level 3 Travel Heath Notice, as follows.https:/…faqs.htmlJapan is still Alert Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) by CDC."
"I just started to cancell my trip with the same itinerary as yours except for leaving on the 25th instead. There are too much unknowns and how bad the situation is in both US and Japan. Japan is hardly administering testing and US is just starting to test more people so I feel that there are too many undetected cases to subject my family to the risk of catching it or being quarantined due to the change in advisory level while traveling. This is what I received this morning from the US Embassy in Tokyo advising not to travel - global level 3- reconsider travel. https:/…ExternalPopup I’ve been planning this trip for a year and was looking forward to seeing the cherry blossom. Maybe another time when things are settled. Now I need to see how I can cancel my flights booked through Hop2, I’ve attempted to call them numerous times and sat on hold for hours (3-4 hrs each), yet no one ever pick up. I cancelled all my Airbnb and rail."
"Your are insane if you think traveling internationally for any but the most necessary of circumstances makes sense right now. Yes it's true Japan's threat level on the CDC website is still just 2, but I think that's because they'd assume if the entire world is level 3 now then we'd get the hint not to travel. Your risk of getting quarantined on either end is huge and Japan's numbers being small are because of an intentional cover up and not because it's actually safer there. I wasn't going to comment in the forums but the fact that people are still thinking of going made me feel like I had to say something. Cancel your trip."
"We need to fight this pandemic together, and each of us has to do his/her part. We should cancel or postpone all nonessential travel for now.Our government is asking all of us to reconsider travel:https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…I know that some of you, myself included, would lose some money if you cancel, but you need to set your priorities straight."
"I agree with the above two posts. Practicing social distancing and cancelling nonessential travel is our civic responsibility, so that we can slow the epidemic and protect our vulnerable populations."
