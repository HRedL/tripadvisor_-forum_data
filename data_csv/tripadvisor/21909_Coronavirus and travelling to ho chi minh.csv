We arw planning to travel to hcm in the second week of february and worried aboit our trip because of coronavirus. Is hcm city safe to travel these days?
There are already 2 threads on here on this subject.
"The coronavirus doesn't have a vaccine and slowly develop unlike SAR bench marked at higher bar as rapidly develop as a lethal weapon. I am not a medical expert or have background but I did many research and homework done and continue to do so as my traveling is ahead in second week of Feb to Vietnam and Thailand; I am nervous as you are but the good news is that is preventable;try to stay the side of healthiness such stick with cooked foods, minimize street foods, drinks plenty of water/juices, wash your hands often, stay away from sick/coughing ppl. Bottom line is stay healthy and keep boosting your immune systems that is the best medicine. A key difference between the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus, however, is that the former has a vaccine. Simply having the choice about whether or not to receive a flu shot can give people an illusion of control. The last not least, i would avoid traveling with kids and/or 65’s as considered vulnerable. And pack some medicines for fevers, coughs, nose masks, hand sanitizers.....Again, I am not a med expert,... do consult with your physician before any travelings. Good luck and safe travels!"
Could you provide the links pls?
This is direct link to CDChttps:/…novel-coronavirus-chinaAlso should consult with your Physician prior to your travel plans.
"What a physician is going to say ? Yes, there is a virus ? To cover himself, of course he is going to say ""Don' go!"". Then don't go to France (2 cases), to the States etc. etc Etc;There are 5 cases in Vietnam, all Chinese, and no death. The authorities have places severe airport sanitary control and there is no fear. As for SARS, the stupid media have created a worldwide panic, for what ? 734 deaths out of 6 BILLION people."
"First of all, are you a doctor? If not then please give some respect to a doctor for his professional advices respectively. Then you can do your own analysis about yours, presumably you have a perfect health with flawless!"
"A*professional advice from a doctor who lives 15 000 km away from Vietnam ? Funny !!! Besides, I LIVE in Vietnam, since 2007, so, I can assure you that I know much better than a far-away doctor, the Viet media are very accurate"
"I'm vietnamese and i will be real with you, even i afraid to go back and met my family now, i would say avoid it wait until everything settles down. There's a case in Irvine which city next to me and I already afraid of it"
"Check this out if you plan to travel anywhere https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Tracking map made by John Hopkins UniversityEdited: 11:26 pm, January 27, 2020 "
Probably not. Too much risk. I have booked for the same time and am now cancelling.
"I would go, just as much risk un Australia"
im cancelling my trip to vietnam and thailand too...better be safe than sorry.. you can earn the money again and re-plan your trip in future.
People panicking & worrying about this need to stay at home

"The virus is here, whether or not it spreads remains to be seen. But as there are many Chinese tourists here and still coming it will be interesting to see if it spreads. The locals are all watching it on TV and are nervous, so make up your own minds up as to if you want to risk it or have the stress!"
">We will bring mask N95 from here.Mask will not protect you in this case , it was on the news yesterday ."
Spangalina... still 2cases? France & Germany have 5 each
"A couple in quarantine on Phu Quoc too, but who knows what will happen as days go by........"
"I really wanted to go to Vietnam next month, but I am not optimistic. It does not seem like the government there is on top of this situation, which is scary given their proximity to China and the number of visitors they get from China."
"> It does not seem like the government there is on top of this situation, Why do you say that? https://moh.gov.vn/ has regular updates if you want to see what they're up to. It's not like they don't have experience at this sort of thing: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/world/sar… and the local news is all over it now: https://tuoitrenews.vn/Governments *everywhere* are scrambling to get on top of this."
"I am on for Vietnam and Thai, very close proximity; I will update the situation and wish me luck:)By the way, out of curiosity..Does anyone clean their handphone daily basic? If not, then you should be more concern and chance of getting sick than Coronavirus."
Latest report from Vietnam's Ministry of health. https://vietnamnews.vn/society/591638/first-…
I'm in Saigon right now. Am I worried about the virus? No. What's worse for my lungs is all the exhaust fumes from the motorbikes especially from the ones that you can see the fumes. 0 deaths in Vietnam from virus but 122 killed in traffic accidents the last week.I don't see anybody asking or canceling their trip because of the traffic.https:/…52764.html
"I was scheduled to leave this morning for a business trip to HCMC and meet my colleague from Taiwan there. I travel here 4x per year - flight was to leave at 7:10am and I postponed the trip at 5:00am. Not worried about getting sick, but more worried about air transportation by getting stuck in VN or getting quarantined. Best to wait and go in March if all is improving. Best of luck and safe travels to those that keep their current plans. Peace!"
"Just arrived HCMC at 8pm & my hotel at 9pm (thanks very much Vietjet for wasting most of my day after I had booked a 10:30am flight), there are not piles of dead bodies everywhere on the streetsEverywhere seems lively & very busy, & noisy too"

"NO risk in Vietnam ; A few CHINESE tourists arrived sick from Wuhan and are hospitalized ; no deaths. Moreover, the Viet government has forbidden all flights between Vietnam and China since yesterday"
"""Too much risk ?"" No risk in Vietnam ; A few CHINESE tourists arrived sick from Wuhan and are hospitalized ; no deaths. Moreover, the Viet government has forbidden all flights between Vietnam and China since yesterday. Once again, the infernal media and their panicky announcements are winning !!!!"
There's a risk but it's very minimal.They banned flights from China yesterday but the incubation period of the virus is 2 weeks. 20 to 25 people are killed in road accidents everyday in Vietnam. That's a higher risk than virus.
"I say go. It's silly and alarmist not to go. There are more risks from influenza and we have vaccines for that. Pollution is more of a risk, as is crossing the road in HCMC. Flying is more of a risk, in terms of risk of infection. Simply take usual precautions: buy a proper mask like the ones Cambridge masks in the uk (military grade protection), use alcohol hand gel, use glasses or sunglasses and don't touch your face or ears as these are the main pathways to infection. Simples. Don't eat salad or anything uncooked that you can't wash yourself in bottled water. If there is salad, do what I do: ask for a bowl of boiling broth. Put the veg or salad in that for a few minutes and you're good to go. Btw, I have an impaired immune system due to Addison's Disease and I still go. Life's too short."
"We can't buy masks here in the UK, pretty much all sold out!!"
"I am flying to HCMC tomorrow via Taiwan.I am not worried much about the virus, but much more about being stuck or quarantined.Does anyone know where to find reliable (official) info about air travel/restrictions to Vietnam via Taiwan? I've heard that 2 days ago Vietnam banned all flights from Hong Kong and Taiwanand lifted than ban next day. But these are rumors and I'd like to see some official info."
We too are travelling 2nd week in feb hanoi seam reap and hoi chi min fit 61 year olds
I'm leaving HCMC this morningYou've got a much higher chance of being knocked down whilst crossing the road than catching the flu in my opinionThe traffic is relentless and the pollution levels can't be good for your lungs whilst walking around either
"As far as I know alert from Cathay Pacific, HK to Vietnam flights resume as of February 2nd."

"10 of 13 borders from China borders to Hongkong are closed now per Carrie Liam??Edited: 7:22 am, February 03, 2020 "
Ref” masks sold out in UK “ post 34. Masks of any type are virtually useless in preventing contracting the virus. Expert medical opinion states that they should not be used for more than 20 minutes as they are more likely to cause a problem.
Makes perfect sense and should have been done sooner.
"But the masks make the people wearing them feel much safer I'd guessThere was a man on the bus to Mui Ne yesterday morning, who put a 2nd mask on over the one he was already wearing, when the man sitting behind him coughed a few times :) lolIn Mui Ne, yesterday afternoon, virtually nobody was wearing face masks"

"Wore the mask yesterday to appease my wife and mother in law. Got a slight headache from wearing it. Was at the mall, restaurant worker comes out from bathroom stall wearing mask but doesn't wash hands."
"9 cases in Vietnam including 4 Vietnamese. Out of the 9, 8 were on the same flight originated from Wuhan, and this out of 97 million people + hundred of thousands of Occidental tourists. One of the Vietnamese is from a province west of Hanoi ans is taken care of in a Hanoi hospital ; no case in Hanoi itself. Besides, all flights between China and Vietnam are banned since 1 February. The risk is really minimal"
"Jacques bMy daughter in law is Vietnamese and she said there were 23 confirmed cases in Vietnam,.."
"moh.gov.vn Has TEN confirmed cases as of 17:00 4th FebHundreds in quarantine, though, so it might rise as they get tested or show symptoms."
"Appreciate the up to date figuresSo currently there are only10 cases of people infected, of which all but 2 came on a single flight from the city of origin of the virus, leaving just 2 people actually infected whilst in Vietnam currently ?"
"I guess it depends on where your source is from, my daughter in law only told me tonight after speaking with her mother this morning she was told 23 cases, I can't confirm or comment any further as that's what she was told by her mother...living north of Nha Trang."
"So why Jay, is the Việt government considering building field hospitals to cope with the demand? Just been on TV. It’s not rocket science, just look at the stats in China!"
10 confirmed cases with 3 cured. https:/…52855.htmlThe 11 million US for this field hospital would be better spent on helping the poor or improving road conditions which kills way more people each day in Vietnam.
"> The 11 million US for this field hospital would be better spent on helping the poor or improving road conditions which kills way more people each day in Vietnam.Well, if the authorities were certain there was no risk at all, they wouldn't be building it. Unfortunately, people here telling everyone there's ""No risk"" doesn't seem to have them convinced. It's a government's job to plan for worst case scenarios and I don't think reasonable people would say that they should do nothing or just wait and see when there are bodies in the streets being pecked apart by crows in China. It may all fizzle out in a few weeks, but if it does it will because people have worked hard to contain it."
"spangalina, I only commented on the figures that were posted earlier on the thread, you are free to do the sameI have been in Mui Ne since yesterday lunchtime where virtually nobody is wearing a face mask. Perhaps you can explain why ?In the 10 days I spent on Phu Quoc, only some of the Asian tourists and local population were wearing face masks, virtually all westerners were not.I am in Vietnam enjoying my holiday, just as I did in Thailand and Sri Lanka over the last 6 weeks or soI am not going to China on this trip so internal Chinese stats are of no concern to me at allI can only apologise for not panicking and feeling no need to wear a face mask on my holidayI have posted many times that people who are worried about whats going on should stay at home and not travel, whilst those who are not worried should enjoy their holidaysThere is no right or wrong decision, up to the individual"
All foreign passport holders who have been in or transited mainland China in the past 14 days will not allow to enter Vietnam as of February 4 (CP alert)This is a significant measurement and precautionary steps taken by Vn’ govn’t.
"From the UK FCO website""The Vietnamese government has recommended that citizens wear masks in public""https:/…health"
Dutch government changed their travel advice for Vietnam from safe to 'risks present'. Quite unique as they only changed the travel advice for China till now.
spangalina... can you give me more info about more hospitals?
Here are two articles explaining the construction of hospitals in Hanoi and HCMC.https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/hanoi-plan…https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/saigon-bui…
"With Hanoi closing some places, are HCMC following suit?"
"Stockport, where did you read Hanoi closing some places??"
@Petfriendly_8....Here's the articlehttps:/…168147.vnp
So we are down to 8 again?? 2 have been releasedhttps:/…
"Stockport, than you for the link.."
"3 have been recovered , we are down to 7Edited: 2:32 pm, February 05, 2020 "
"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/202…confirmed hereI presume, if it is going to spike it will be in about 10days time?Edited: 2:54 am, February 06, 2020 "
My read was that the field hospitals were being constructed to place Vietnam nationals in quarantine when they return from China. Canada is also placing its nationals in quarantine when they are evacuated from China.
Yes field quarantine hospitals for VM nationals returning from China
"> 3 have been recovered , we are down to 72 new cases as of 19h00 ngày 6-2-2020 https://suckhoedoisong.vn/(No idea if this is among people who were already in quarantine or not.)"
https:/…
"1 new case as of 21h40 ngày 7-2-2020 https://suckhoedoisong.vn/ :Vietnam: 13 people with nCoV.Inside:- 02 Chinese father and son (01 person has recovered and discharged from the hospital);- 06 Vietnamese citizens have returned from Wuhan, China (01 has recovered and left the hospital);- 01 Vietnamese citizen is a receptionist who has close contact with 2 Chinese father and son (has been discharged and discharged);- 01 US citizen came to Vietnam, previously in transit in Wuhan, China.- 01 close contact with patients previously positive for nCoV.- 02 cases: 1 mother, 1 sibling of a previous patient positive for nCoV.Treatment from: 03 people were discharged from the hospital."
"That sounds encouraging that seeing ppl are recovering fast. Some in South Korea as well. Since I am lacking of info from Thailand, I have decided to cancel my trip to Thailand and kept Vietnam trip. Apparently, I got some refunds back from non refundable air tickets for flights in Thailand and full credits back for non refundable hotels booking. I won’t share here publicly but inbox. I didn’t expect at all. And I had just applied another a single VOA and approved letter within 4 hrs."

"I'm wondering that people seems to be much more worried about vietnam or in vietnam then in my country. We have currently 13 cases in Germany and Vietnam has 10, but here everything is very calm. Also still a lot of chinese travelers around here. No restrictions so far, just that they have to give their travel address to the authorities after arriving at the airport. Also a lot of people around here are coughing currently, which is totally normal at this time because of cold and flu session. I'm wondering how ""panic"" people are about that in Vietnam. I have a flight to HCMC mid of next week and also already domestic flights to Dalat and Da Nang. Recently I had also had my yearly cold, but I'm fit already. But it's not unnusual to cough a little bit more after that, because throat is still more sensible for a few weeks after. Will people fall into panic when they here someone cough a bit? I mean then it would also be a hard time for that people who have typical smoking coughing."
"I have no clue if someone is coughing or sneezing, will be picked up to be asked and quarantine? How do they separate someone to be quarantine? does one has to have a fever?"
"Also still a lot of chinese travelers around here. No restrictions so far...——————-/—————all Chineses ( Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, even Chinese from US, Britain, Europe.....) yes all Chinese copied face. But there is a crystal clear restriction for mainland China by Vietnam govn’t. “Anyone” even makes transit to Vietnam @ mainland China will deny entry."
"Another good news ! I learned yesterday evening that the Lao Cai border is closed, which is good because, normally, Sapa, which is only 34 km from LC, is filled up with Chinese on week-ends and Chinese holidays"
"Our trip is planned for first week of April. Everything has been booked, including domestic flight within Vietnam. After following this thread and different news platforms we have decided to cancel. Money will be lost and our hopes for seeing Vietnam this year crushed. We have been planning this trip for just under a year. So you must know the amount of thought that went into the decision to cancel. We have been going back and forth playing out each decision. The reasons for us to finally say we canceling. Our lives are worth more than the monetary loss or our sadness for a vacation cancelled. Why would we willingly take the chance to play Russian roulette with our lives and whoever we could possibly infect. Vietnam will still be around when this virus has passed. We want to experience the country at it's best, not while it's fighting an epidemic. People are suggesting that you go. Will you be enjoying it like you imagined when you put the trip together on paper, I very much doubt it. This is not just some regular flu that you can take meds for and be on your way. Think of the consequences of being sick there and how it would affect your vacation and travel companion/s. If they are well do they leave you? Or vice versa. ""There are biochemical indicators that a number of the body’s organ systems are likely affected and you have an inflammatory response that is disrupting their function to some extent,” Dr. Schaffner said.The lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and the systems that control blood clotting are all affected, Dr. Schaffner said, though it is not clear that the virus itself infects organs other than the lungs.The inflammatory response is a hallmark of a serious viral disease, he said, adding that in recent years it has become apparent that heightened inflammation from diseases like the flu can persist for a month or so after the acute illness is gone, and can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in older people.""https:/…coronavirus-patients.html"
"@rgb1516 when your trip is in April, it's still a lot of time until then. You said you will not get back any money when canceling anyway. So I would recommend to wait until end of march before making any decisions. When you canceled ones there is no way back, even when situation might get better."
"Money lost, is a small percentage. Can save it up again before the next trip is booked. Most things we were able to cancel without a penalty fee. Have cancelled everything earlier today. Will rather go when everything has returned to normal. Which will definitely not be anytime soon."
Money will be lost and our hopes for seeing Vietnam this year crushed. We have been planning this trip for just under a year. So you must know the amount of thought that went into the decision to cancel. ========================1% truth with 99% sounds pissed off; it’s normal for 1st time trolling.Wish you well!
"1% truth with 99% sounds pissed off; it’s normal for 1st time trolling. ------------------------------------- Do you know the truth if you do i would like to hear it.Oh come on, have a little bit of thought, some people are more nervous than others, Do you trust the vietnam government? i dont, there is a lot of uncertainly, i will still be going at the beginning of may."
"Do you know the truth....No I don’t Do you trust Vietnam govnt?No I don’t =======I will be totally lying if I say yes; that’s why I need to go out to Vietnam and observe with my two naked eyes after done all my research and homework. I just got my two boxes of n95 masks. I will tell you it works or not on next week. I just disagree with the folks that come out here and crying out loud and had never been in Vietnam, and plus experiences. If I say Pho is a delicious bowl of noodle may not be to your taste or you may prefer fish and chips, and move on... no drama. Mental stress can cause many side effects worst than nCoV. Don’t ask me why:)"
I m here in Ho Chi Minh since last week. No scare here.
"I was in Saigon the past 3 weeks, there is a slight uptick in mask use but still lots of people not wearing masks.The day that I left (4th), Grab did put out a automated message in Vietnamese asking people to wear masks.I did experience two incidents of people moving away from me because I'm Chinese but I speak English. So there are paranoid people in Saigon but 99.9% are just going about their daily lives.The only thing that the government has done is ordered schools closed for 2 weeks."
"I too, am traveling to Vietnam the last couple weeks of February and into March. Without tying to minimize the dangers of the Coronavirus virus, I just have to put the whole thing in the proper perspective and am not hesitating to go for a second. I mean really, if your worried about getting sick, why travel anyway. The Flu alone kills almost 80,000 Americans alone each year. Travelers don’t hesitate to travel because of that. And being in close quarters on a plane and public places is way more exposure than most peoples normal lives, therefore more susceptible to the flu, but people don’t give it a second thought. And about a bazillion other misfortunes could befall any traveler in the best of times. So adding one more thing to the mix of potential “ dangers of travel “ will not deter me for a second. Besides, if I did get the virus, it would make a good story."
Not if you die it won’t!!

"So,... currently, I am @ HK airport as writing this and 1 1/2 hrs waiting.Flight from SF to HK was half empty and good for everyone having big room for comfort. Most Chinese folks wore masks, which was good for me;). I put my n95 mask in HK to protect potential spits from surrounding;) and I constantly use hand sanitizer. So far most ppl wear masks in HK airport.I will update as landing in HCMC Safe travels!"
"JohnP, the link is not working, I think??"
"I live in HCMC, and here's what I've learned recently. Not sure if it is useful to travelers, but the government shut down schools for the past two weeks, and it seems almost certain that they will be closed in Saigon for at least the rest of the month. Secondly, and perhaps not surprisingly, there is a shortage of face masks. Stores are only allowed to sell a small quantity, and some stores that usually carry them haven't had them in stock since the beginning of the month.My apologies if this information has been stated before, but I haven't had time to read every post on this thread."
"@hansblix Thanks for the info. Are you aware of any tourist sites or major public gathering areas like restaurant/bar/tourist districts being closed? I'm scheduled for a 3 week vacation in Vietnam in March and other than being a little more careful with hand washing I am not overly concerned about getting sick, but I also don't want to go on vacation to Vietnam if tourist happenings are closed.Edited: 11:25 am, February 15, 2020 "
"I arrived 10ish @ HCMC airport on Valentine’s Day and was super busy with VOA line, took about an hours; not many asian facial complexion but I am close one:) wore n95 with gasket sealed tight, very sweaty around my fave and not comfortable after all with hot and humid weather, was fine on airplane with cool AC. I wanted to bring out about n95 mask, there are different types of n95; the typical one is not safe as many mentioned and claimed because it doesn’t have gasket fit but just the name and the look ...and thus lots of void area for virus to freely craw in comparing to surgical masks. The one I have is too good but uncomfortable with this weather.So far I am staying at Thu dau mot 35-46 min away from HCMC.Very comfortable and relax. Very local and life is good in here. 80,000 haircut for shampoo, face wash and a little massage throw in for almost an hour, can’t beat that price! I stick with most cooked foods and avoid raws and salads for daily diet plus 30-46 min in gym. Very normal life in here; many local wear masks but I don’t see strange and even better for me, really; more safer then pre nCoV time. Funny thing is that every drivers open wide eyes and put the mask on as soon as I get into taxi:). One guy try to cheat me with meter by driving so slow and pass the designation, so I gave a couple of coughs with high pitch that made him nervous and force to press on gas pedal and immediate u turn;)So far life is good, I go massage every other days, swimming, gym every days...make myself busy.. one more week to relax before back to reality.Safe travels!"
"Lukhalay, You just gave me a big smile about your tactic:)"
"How's city of HCMC? Still very crowded, in restaurant, historical sites?"
"I am not staying in HCMC, so I can’t comment on that but looking at many tours are slashing the price which means many are desperate, for sure. Schools are closed for months, I am in Binh Duong, and so far in here is a normal with local life. If you are a tourist then this is a good for your money spending power; hotels are offering big discounts as well. Stay fit tight. I see many restaurants offer hand sanitizer at entry and become a daily norm."
"In Vietnam, a total of 16 cases of acute respiratory infections due to new strains of corona virus have been recorded, of which 14 cases were treated by doctors.

"We were in Vietnam from 9th until 18th Feb.. We were in Hanoi, Ninh Binh, Halong Bay, Da Nang, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh City. It was still many people everywhere however the local said it was less busy than usual with the tourists."

"So... today, I am leaving Vietnam... so far my impression during stay in Binh Dough was really nice. I do daily walk around neighbors and enjoy coffee and local eateries. Yah, ppl are wearing masks but I don’t, but I do carry hand sanitizer all time with me and clean my hands especially after touching money, this is a very dirty source with many finger prints; I remind many as I could to wash hands after touching money. But locals seem to more focus on the masks to prevent. And many Chinese restaurants are closed now in here and some locals do not allow or refuse to service to particular group sadly. Strongly recommend bring hand sanitizers if you do plan to travel any where.Safe travels!"

"Bookings are cancelled on a large scale, we hear from hotel and tour operators sources. But I really can't see any change in prices of their services. It's not cheaper at all to book a hotel or a tour.Where do you see those discounted tours because of lower number of tourists?"
"As of now, Vietnam govnt doesn’t allow any mainland China and/or make transit in mainland China. It may change later but if you can change transit in HK or Taiwan will be better. I had Sfo>HK> SGN"
