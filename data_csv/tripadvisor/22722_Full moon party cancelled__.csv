Hello everyone..it is full moon party cancelled?? Because my friend told me it canceled on this 8 march..
"Yes, they officially just confirmed this. Anyway, there are so many other things here on the island that are much better than the FMP ;)"

"Yes, should be no surprise as other events have already been cancelled."
I’m on the ferry there and just saw this. Messaged a hostel there who said that only stages are banned: there will still be music and alcohol. They can’t ban those or they ban the entire livelihood of that part of the island. So basically it will still run without stages. But I guess some will be put off and not turn up. But most accommodation is not refundable at this late stage.
Yup hope that..i already at aiport after receive this news..my hotel also inform this..hope have some entertainment on thats day
Like what - we cant Seem to find anything:/
"It's not totally going to be dead I'm sure, even now there are people on the beach playing volley ball... (at my time of viewing) and lights in the back ground, and it's not even officially full moon. Perhaps not the usual music venues, but I am sure people will make their own party and make the most of it.It's not unusual to see Haad Rin or Ban Tai areas pretty dead between the events.https://www.youtube.com/watch…"

"If they don't clean the beach, it won't be long before people stop going there, as it a total sh*thole after the a-holes leave the following day.Try cleaning up after your ignorant, arrogant selves.Edited: 12:57 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Just look at the live web cam, Haad Rin Beach, it's not dead, but probably not as busy as usual.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqneC6Bi18"
"Loving what I see this morning on the webcam, a beautiful beach that hasn't been wrecked overnight"
Wow...........that is amazing.Lovely when tourist aren't about.
Well that was pretty disappointing: many fewer people than normal. Just like a normal night leading up to the full moon party rather than the actual party itself. Really lacked the vibe and atmosphere. Usually the whole beach is full but it was just a small section and people in bars. If I’d never been before I would have enjoyed it but having been before I would say it was not nearly as good. Also the beach may be initially gross the next morning but they clean it quick smart. I keep getting hate for this but coronavirus is not spreading in the community in Thailand so it just seemed so unnecessary to cancel the party and damage locals’ livelihoods. A bunch of Swedish and German backpackers dancing on a beach are not going to be spreading the virus around.
Ignorance is Blisshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3olKpkhH0Q
Sweden and Germany have some of the highest recorded cases of Coronavirus!
"Well backpackers didn’t just arrive from those countries. Even if they did the virus isn’t transmitting here due to the heat. People are totally ignoring the mechanics of viral transmission. Been here two weeks and haven’t even come across anyone here who even has a cough. Plus if Thailand really cared about coronavirus maybe they could have checked my fever at DMK, Krabi airport, or on any of the multiple ferries and buses I’ve taken but they haven’t because spoiler alert, coronavirus is not spreading here"
It’s pretty hot here in Australia and it’s spreading here
"# 19"" the virus isn’t transmitting here due to the heat ""Wow.......you are a special person....555"" spoiler alert, coronavirus is not spreading here 'And yet on average, we have a new case 'reported' just about every day....50+ in how many days.....imagine that.Edited: 7:13 am, March 09, 2020 "
"The vast majority of the cases in Thailand have been imported from Italy, Iran, China eg cold countries. There is no sustained community transmission in Thailand because the virus does not like this heat. I am from Australia and believe me it is NOT this hot in the cities where it’s spreading now. Just do a quick Google at the temperatures now. Temperatures here are around 26-32 and the SARS virus (similar to this) dies off at around 30 degrees. It is nothing like that right now in Australia’s coastal cities as we head into autumn. And Tell me which cases in Thailand have actually been due to internal spreading? There have also been no reported cases on this or nearby islands. And again if they were actually concerned maybe do any screening or checking at any ports... but they’re not. I am far from ignorant as I have been tracking every single new case in Thailand (while watching with bemusement as it explodes in colder countries)."
