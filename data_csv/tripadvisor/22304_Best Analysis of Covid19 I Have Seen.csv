I am sharing what I think is the best analysis of Covid19 out there. Comes with policy recommendations.SF Bay Area one focal point.https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca
"No. I used to do a lot of statistical modeling in my line of work, and just reading the article I could tell something was wrong. It reminded me of the old adage, ""If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bs."" I've seen lots of statistical and scientific articles where the author tries to mask the fact that they don't really know what they're talking about by going overboard with figures and charts, in the hope that readers will be impressed by all the ""data"" and won't be knowledgeable enough to realize that it's nonsense. That's what this article was.According to his Linked In profile, the guy who wrote it has no medical background. (I will give him points for having a Masters in Industrial Engineering, which is also the graduate degree I have.) His other articles for medium.com include ""How to Write a Funny Speech,"" ""What The Rise of Skywalker Can Teach about Storytelling,"" and ""What I Learned Building a Horoscope that Blew Up on Facebook."" He's certainly not someone I would look to as an authority on medicine and viruses. The most measured and level-headed information on the Coronavirus that I've found so far is in The Economist magazine."
I agree with @simba_8 . I read this article and immediately disliked it. So much fear mongering. And I googled this guy too. He is in no way a medical professional. I have so many friends who read this article and freaked tf out. It's so irresponsible ugh.
Medical professional here. Some of my colleagues are sharing this around but data overload to me. Simba... can you link that Economist one?
"Chinita, it wasn't a single article. It's The Economist's overall coverage about coronavirus that I find worthwhile. You might need to create an account to read these -https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/th…"
