"Hello, I'm looking for a bit off information if possible, I booked to go to Benidorm on the 18th April, but booked apartment separately throught alpharooms, I contacted them today to see if I could get refunded as I won't be able to fly with what's going on, they said they can offer me another date to go, I told them that's was no good as we didn't know when this problem would be resolved, and told him I would like a refund, but he said they can't do that, surely that can't be right? I have taken out insurance when I booked my flights throught easyJet, (who I can't get hold off on phone) will I be able to get my money back throught the insurance or will that just cover the flights for when they get cancel. Or does anyone know what else I should do. Any help greatly appreciated I just don't know what to do."
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I had similar problem with Booking.com.Would not refund money or offer a change of dates.
If the airline cancel you will get your money back or an alternative date. If the apartments close down for the date you are staying you will also get your money back.However if your flights are on and the apartment open you will get nothing back.
"Ditto, same result with Booking.com."
You are likely to be disappointed with your travel insurance since many providers exclude epidemics. Suggest you read through your policy before trying to call your provider.
"Well the first thing you need to do is sit and read through the terms and conditions that you will have ticked and signed to say you have already read, that will tell under what circumstances, if at all, that you are entitled to a refund. The same goes for the insurance, if you had read the terms and conditions you would know exactly what is and isn't covered."
"As your holiday is a while off yet. Sorry we will have to wait and see how things are nearer the time. We are all waiting as its not our turn yet. They are prioritizing. There will be lots of people trying to sort out their March 2020 holiday refunds many will be much more complex, families with children.However, if in the next few weeks, alpha were to offer you a refund, take that refund."
"Thanks for all the replies, will hold out for now, and hope things improve or they contact me to say I can get refunded."
"Booking.com are just a website for the hotels to advertise on. If your not getting a refund it because the hotel wont give it. booking.com have no say in the matter. maybe one thing people may learn out of this is be careful read terms and conditions dont just tick the boxEdited: 4:07 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"I have only now got my choice to rebook my flight without charge, was flying monday. Not been offered the choice to rebook the return flight yet. I booked hotel through booking.com, but had the free cancellation/ pay on arrival option."
