Coming down mid-July. Can anyone say what the situation with Restaurants is in relation to Covid-19 restrictions.
It seems like most restaurants are open for dine-in in some capacity. We have eaten at a few inside but they are limited on seating due to social distancing and wait times have been long. Oddly it seems that fast food places are the only ones not allowing any dine in. I suppose more places are opening everyday so things could easily change but this is what I have noticed
Thanks Robert. That is what we are noticing also home in Ohio. Trying to make a grocery plan and didnâ€™t know what to expect.
Robert C gave some really good information. Be sure to stop in one of the Welcome Centers when you get to town.
