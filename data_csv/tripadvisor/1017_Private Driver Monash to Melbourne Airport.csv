"Can anyone recommend a private driver company (not Uber) that can take a student from Monash University to the airport in Melbourne, in the next week?"

"If you're worried about Covid-19, Ubers here are generally spotless- I would be less concerned, especially if your student uses hand sanitiser after the trip."
If a limo try this but agree a Uber would be as goodhttps://www.omnicar.com.au/
Take a hire car. They're the people that are usually holding the passenger's name on a placard at arrivals but they obviously work both ways
"Er, ResmeN, a ""hire car"" is the term usually used for a car you rent and drive yourself."
"Just take an Uber....if you want a nice car, then select Uber premium."
