"Obviously, nobody has a crystal ball and knows when COVID-19 is going to subside, but for those of you currently in/residing in Paris, is there a sense that there will be a turning point by late summer?"
My crystal ball is the same colour as yours.
What is likely to be happening in July where you live?
"I agree it is hard to say. I had seen something that Britain was estimating peak outbreak 13 or so weeks out ( which would be mid June). I just wondered if there was anything like that floated in France. In the US, the outbreak is just starting to ramp up, and measures are being taken (belatedly, to be sure) that are intended to help mitigate a huge outbreak. Personally, the reason I ask: we had plans for a trip May 23. Our airline has offered to waive change fees, but we would have to take our trip before December. We cannot be gone after mid August as my daughter is in school and I teach in a private school. I’m just trying to salvage our dream vacation... sigh."
"It doesn't matter if one lives in Paris or not. No one knows not even the epidemiologists. If it were myself I would count out 2020 as a time to do leisure traveling.Our airline is giving vouchers which we don't have, but if we had any they'd expire August 2020.Edited: 11:32 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Most people who have a booking in the next few months are wondering the same thing as you. All you can do is keep an eye on the situation, but it could also be that your government, or the French government, makes your mind up for you.My trip is booked for May, and if I had to make a decision today I would delay it until August/September. But who knows what will be happening at that time or even if we'll be allowed to travel."
I think we have scheduled the bubonic plague for July. Paris is so pleasant without the tourist hordes that we have to come up with new reasons to self isolate.
"welcome,you are getting some great info to consider.""..Personally, the reason I ask: we had plans for a trip May 23. Our airline has offered to waive change fees, but we would have to take our trip before December. We cannot be gone after mid August as my daughter is in school and I teach in a private school...""you may want to consider the big picture. All you are looking at is YOUR Vacation and time. Ever consider what you will do if YOUR schools shut down?what will happen to that August school time? same for you. every consider if they shut the school down where you work? I would push it out as far as you can or want to and then hope for the best, hopefully people will come down from the panic and things maybe returning to normal or as much as they can.Just remember that in the winter time other bugs can crop up. Then you have the shorter daylight hours and everything else. Then also consider taking off the blinders and look at the whole world. Maybe head south where its warmer or even to Hawaii or ? good luck."
"kerouac2: "" Paris is so pleasant without the tourist hordes...""I find it so ironic how ex-pats seem annoyed and aggrieved by tourist visiting Paris, do they no realise they themselves are tourist who have overstayed their welcome. Actual French people have the same distain towards these ex-pats as they have for us tourists. Its funny how they say 'as a Parisian...', you are not Parisian nor French, you're economic migrants that is all, I understand why you leave your country seeking somewhere with real culture and history, but you cant assimilate just by learning a few French phrases - culture cant be faked no matter how hard you try.This goes out generally to our cousins in the states and down under who seem to linger around this forum just because they have visited Paris a few times. You are not better than anyone else you look down at, you are still devoid of any culture and history - just focus on improving you own country.This is a travel forum not a social club where you boast about the good old days you could walk up to Mona Lisa and spend hours with 'her' - by the way do you realise how pathetic you sound when you talk about a painting as if it is a real person."
Well that post is a nice distraction from coronavirus.
"It's amazing GYT656 how you claim not to be a troll and just a first time poster but yet you seem to know so much about so many long time posters on this forum. I haven't reported any of your posts, BTW. Continue to troll on. I won't report you."

"Mountpleasantmom - We are in a very similar situation. We are currently scheduled for a trip that leaves May 22nd and while our airline has offered to let us change our trip and rebook we would have to fly before the end of the year. I'm a teacher too and unfortunately, we would not be able to take such a trip before next summer. I'm holding out in the hope that a) maybe, somehow things improve and we can still go or b) the airline allows us to get a refund like they are currently doing for trips to/from Italy for March/April. I think our trip timing makes it hard - we are too far out to get a refund for things yet, but probably not far enough out for things to be okay to travel again... so we're kind of in limbo. Good luck with whatever you decide to do!"
yeah we are looking at thousands of loss for tickets too and unlikely to be able to travel given the arc of the epidemic before our time frame for change ends. Not good. Better than say dying of it which I may do -- I am 75 and better than losing my job as many are -- but still losing several K plus the worthless 1000 paid for the travel insurance that doesn't apply is not a happy thing..

"If you look at the warnings on official museums web sites they have or did have a common theme when they first posted their closings, postponements, cancellations. Many projected only as far as some date in April. Since then it appears the world has taken on a predicted war-footing posture, so July is probably not ready for prime time bookings.Here's what Disney said: Disneyland Paris is open and welcoming guests. We are in regular contact with the French authorities, and based on their direction, we have temporarily amended some experiences and operations.These changes, which you will find below, have been implemented on a temporary basis starting Thursday, March 12th, 2020 through Wednesday, April 15th, 2020:"
"Hey, JBadgely -Thanks for your post. I guess that would be best-case for us, Delta offering a straight-up refund. We could try again next summer. Actually, BEST case would be that the virus subsides sooner than later and the whole world is in the clear when summer hits. That doesn’t appear likely. We’ll just have to sit tight (and wash our hands)."
"Our trip is planned to take place on Apil 24th for a week. The whole trip has been paid fully. I do have an option offered by AirFrance to obtain a voucher to be valid for a year. But I've paid for the hotel fully with a non-refundable option. For a full week! It's a lot of money. And I don't know if they would be willing to allow, forward from the line of the law, not the money back, but a voucher similar to this of AirFrance"
"Marina,I would still wait, France could end up going the way of Spain and close all their hotels (I hope not though). If your hotel is closed, you would get a refund. Your offer for Air France voucher will still be there. Otherwise contact the hotel to see what they are able to do."
"Oh, thank you so much for the quick response.We've booked the flight and then the hotel in the mid. January, when there were no sighs something would go wrong. I've also corresponded in detail with the hotelWhen things started to happen, we've been holding on to hopes that they will change for the better. We have been even ready to go through quarantine on return back to Israel, as for Israeli authorities' demand.But it gets scarier each day, and now as of 17 March, all movement in France is restricted to journeys that are absolutely necessary, until April 15.But I don't think it's going to be over until then, and it could be too late asking the hotel for any consideration.Also, I and my partner are not so strong and do have underlying health issues, so I am not sure if it would be safe to travel nowThank you anyway. Stay safe"
"I find post 9 just so shocking! Really, can you not see the irony in Kerouac's comment about tourist hordes? I grew up in a seaside resort in the south of England where complaining about the summer crowds was a favourite pastime among locals. Kerouac and other regular posters on this forum are long-term residents and not tourists who have outstayed their welcome. Many of us have French spouses/partners. I have lived in France for 34 years and when I tell people about the problems I'm likely to have because of Brexit a frequent reaction is ""But don't you have French nationality ?"" - that is a hardly being shown by the locals that I have outstayed my welcome."
The most shocking thing to me is that the troll still thinks I am an expat. I became a repat 47 years ago.
