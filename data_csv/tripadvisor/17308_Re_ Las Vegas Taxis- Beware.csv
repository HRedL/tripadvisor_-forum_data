never say its your first time there even if it is.i went from Ellis Island to Hard Rock casino about 5-6 long blocks away. taxi meter showed 12.10$ the other three times i rode there averaged 7$. possibly a fast meter on a dodge charger taxi???
What an odd first post. About a taxi rip off from a New Yorker.
Thanks for the heads up
"I really try not to use the taxis in Vegas, whenever possible I use the shuttle take the bus etc. Even long time posters are reporting being long hauled after numerous trips so it can and does happen even to frequent visitors not just first timers. I'm curious though if 10% of passengers daily get long hauled how much $$ that would be?"
"Yup,I paid 12dollars to get from Luxor to Ballys last trip and told the driver to take the cheapest route. Sure glad he didnt long-haul me.lol"
I once put $11 in a slot machine and when I got done I had nothing. I really thought it would only cost me $7.Do your homework and be specific about the route you want the cab to use. Frank Sinatra Dr. is a great road. Runs right behind all the Resorts on the West side of LV Blvd. It take 5-7 minutes to get from TI to MB (as an example).
Gotta do your research about taxis about the long hauling and tunnel nightmares.
We got charged $12.10 last week from ballys to the airport and I thought that was cheap :)
"As we will be first time visitors to Las Vegas we were talking about our trip last night and I was asked ""What's TA have to say about Vegas?""""Loads to do and one visit isn't enough but the real thing we have to watch out for are Taxi Drivers trying to screw us over for money""Frankly, that's the most overriding thing I have learned from TA Vegas from this forum. I'm thinking of getting a Sedan on arrival just to avoid the hassle endured by so many people."
"It is a shame that some think we should now have to know the streets in and around LasVegas just so we can tell the cabbie the best way to go ,only to have the cabbie go the way they want anyway. I just try to avoid cabs when I can. I guess I just have cab bad luck. lol"
"I know a lot of people just laugh this off but it's no more than theft by the drivers who do it. The toothless Taxi Authority can do very little to stop it and you have to presume that the powers that be are turning a blind eye, with the taxi companies making it worth their while to do so.Introducing a zoned flat rate for trips to and from the airport would stop it immediately.We use taxi's as a last resort and will take the monorial, bus or shuttle option first if available."
"Taxi drivers never cease to amaze.This year we got in the taxi for the airport, and I said ""Flamingo, no tunnel please"". He said I would be better going that way as there was a gay and lesbian parade (this was, I think about 7.30pm) and the streets to the Flamingo were choked. I asked why they would be parading off strip, but he repeated it was really busy and that route would take us an hour to an hour and a half. I said we were regular visitors to Vegas and we always went Harmon onto Flamingo and insisted he take that route. He reluctantly agreed and 15 minutes later we arrived at the Flamingo. Not a parade in sight. ""That was a short 90 minutes"" I said. ""You were lucky"" he replied. ""Lets hope the luck continues"" says I.Never be intimidated by these guys - they know exactly what they are doing, and, as a previous poster says, it's theft. And ignore those that say ""chill, you're in vegas, who cares about a few dollars you'll lose on slots anyway"", I say - if thats the way you let people treat you, then....well...good luck."
"Be informed and you'll be fine, and above all, remember that you're paying for the service so you're in charge. Use the handy innerwebs before you leave home to Google map the best way from the airport to your hotel; search this forum for the hundreds of similar topics; and finally, don't be afraid to ask the airport worker who runs the taxi line, ""So, is there any construction or street closings I should know about?"" You should never allow yourself to be taken advantage of just because you're on vacation."
"Couldn't agree more.Know your way before you get into the cab. Get online and map it out, or ask people on forums the best way to get to a place.If you get into a cab and sepcify how you wish to get from here to there and they don't adhere to your request, you can simply tell them as soon as they get off course that you'll be contacting the Taxi Authority as soon as you arrive, and that you won't pay them above what the average fare is for the ride to where you are going. Often times, this will cause them to stop the meter.Or, pay the fare and don't tip. Tips are not deserved if a service is not performed up to expectations. Tips are for people who do an exceptional job at what they are providing you."
"J.C., did the taxi driver take a strange route? Because all the ""taxi-ripoff"" posts involve the driver ""long-hauling"" the passenger, taking a less direct route to run up the fare. Yours is the first post I have seen suggesting that a meter has been rigged to be dishonest.You do know that there are ""waiting charges"" that run up the meter while you are stuck in traffic, don't you?"
"""You do know that there are ""waiting charges"" that run up the meter while you are stuck in traffic, don't you?""I've been told the driver needed to take the tunnel because of a traffic jam. And then what the poster said about being the parade. If there are truly jams, wouldn't the driver WANT to take customer's suggested route and run up the meter?"
one time i had a driver say his shift was almost up. would i like to hang and down a few beers with him. lol!!!
"lets see route taken from ellis island to HRH was normal. north on koval to harmon. then left turn on harmon. then left onto paradise i believe, then turn into driveway of HRH"
"good point, kelly"
Misty it has been estimated that long hauling costs consumers more than $10 million per year. lvrj.com/business/going-the-long-way-costly-…
"Well, first, it would show $12.10, not 12.10$.Hard to say what the issue may have been. Did you take the same route? Did you hit a whole bunch of red lights? Did the meter seem to be calculating awfully fast?"
"J.C., if the driver took the normal route, it must have been either (1) long waits in traffic, (2) a fast meter or (3) add-on charges of some kind.I have not heard of any cab drivers rigging their meters, but it is possible. And it is possible that there are add-on charges that the driver put on that he should not have. (I am only aware of a pick-up fee for the airport, but maybe there could be other add-ons.)But the wait time (for traffic, including those two left turns you had to make, onto Paradise and then into the Hard Rock driveway) could explain it -- at $30 per hour, getting stuck in traffic can add up."
"I am amazed at the level of reading comprehension demonstrated here. The OP was not tunneled. The OP was not traveling to or from the airport. The OP was not told about construction problems or parades or anything else. The OP was not long hauled, but was driving along the normal route for his trip."
"If you have a phone that has GPS on it, you can quickly check for traffic along the preferred route as you're on your way to the taxi line. This way, you can see if there is a jam someplace so you'll be prepared for the ""You don't want to go that way, there is construction,"" excuse."
"Having travelled all over North America & various countries, it’s very perplexing that VEGAS which relies so heavily on tourism has the WORST TAXI SERVICE. On average 50-75% of drivers will offer a good service, but there are many rotten peas in the pod. Beware even with good tipping intentions of 15-20%, some Vegas taxis will SCAM patrons by attempting to illegally add-on to fare. If the fare they tell you is not what’s on the meter, then never add a tip – it’s because they are adding it in. One driver lied & said after 10pm there is a minimum fare of $20 when the meter stated $11. If you must use a Vegas taxi – GET the 4-DIGIT TAXI-NUMBER before your ride starts, as soon as you step in the car, it should be on the RIGHT DASHBOARD. The worst a car and driver smells, the more likely he is to be aggressive or scam you, because he is NOT used to being tipped due to the unpleasant smelling ride. IF YOU CAN STEP OUT OF A SMELLY CAB BEFORE RIDE STARTS, PLEASE DO SO IMMEDIATELY instead of suffocating yourself with B.O. If an incident occurs, report them. Don’t forget to write down that number or you might regret it. Don’t get into altercation for a few bucks unless you’re a large dude. Try to use the Airport Express shuttles instead of taking a cab. It will take you slightly longer to get to your hotel, but this service is more reliable, safer, and courteous. Once a cab driver puts your luggage into the trunk and leaves his spot in line, it will be very hard for you to exit the car if unpleasant. The hotels need to put more pressure on the taxi associations to demand better service, and post a passenger bill of rights with complaint number in the backseat of cabs."
"In August a taxi driver charged me $24 for a trip from McCarran to Caesars on a no traffic Sunday morning. I'm not one to say much, but that is my last taxi ride in Las Vegas. I have been to LV probably a hundred times, but it's not my job to know the routes, it's the taxi companies' job to police their drivers to protect their reputations and the integrity of the service they are supposed to be providing to tourists. Anyway, from now on, I'll take the shuttle, rent a car or take the bus. By the way, if you just want a car for the middle of your stay (to sightsee or whatever) Enterprise will bring a car to your hotel at a very good rate. It does take time while you get the paperwork done at their rental place (I think it was in the Westin, slightly off the strip). And then they take you back to your hotel when you're done with the car. Cost about a quarter of what the in hotel desk wanted for the same car."
"As a point of interest, what can i expect to pay from Fremont to Harrahs at 3;30 in the morning?"
So glad my husband always insists on renting a car....this taxi stuff seems to be so much work lol
"""Having travelled all over North America & various countries, it’s very perplexing that VEGAS which relies so heavily on tourism has the WORST TAXI SERVICE""Larry S - In my experience LV is far from the worst. Try Bangkok and you'll know how bad a taxi system can become."
Makes me wonder if I am getting long hauled when I visit other big cities. I don't know ANY of the routes or even the street names when I step in their cabs.  Or does this ONLY happen in Vegas?
"The driver probably dropped off a fare then picked OP up without clearing the meter...drivers with very short rides tend to roll the meter to avoid paying trip charge of 80c up to $1.50 per ride(depending on cab co.) and essentially making extra $ if the next fare didn't notice the meter.No driver can rig the meter,it does happen from time to time that meters malfunction.The driver will not knowingly drive a cab for 12 hours with a broken meter......as soon as he's aware of the problem he will deal with it ASAP.no if's and or but's about it."
"After about 100 trips to the strip (well, let's say a few trips a year for many years), we are going to downtown Las Vegas so we can ride the WAX (its an express bus) for $2 each way per person. Just on strike against the overcharges by the taxi drivers, the long waits for the shuttle, the leaving two hours early when you shuttle back to the airport (it's a 10 minute drive, can't these people get their act together, why do tourists have to give up hours of their vacations waiting for the things, then driving all over the strip as the shuttle drops off at every hotel, then having to leave hours early to get back to the airport because the shuttle doesn't want to be responsible for riders missing their planes.) The whole system is just getting too cumbersome and unpleasant. No one is acting for the tourists. Frankly, I am surprised the casino owners don't have the grease to put a stop to the whole mess, and clean it up. Another inexplicable annoyance is waiting over an hour to check in to many of the hotels because they have so few people working the front desk. If nothing else, you would think the casinos would want everyone gambling instead of waiting in line. And the same for the buffets. Just hours wasted which people could be spending gambling or going to shows. I honestly don't get it."
"""If nothing else, you would think the casinos would want everyone gambling instead of waiting in line.""Because not everyone is going to gamble if they're not waiting in line."
"A couple years ago, my sister and I took a taxi to the Hard Rock. Paid about $7. On the ride back to the same location we watched the meter spin past that as the driver tried to drive into the underground parking garage, etc. All of a sudden he became deaf when I asked him to just drop us off at the corner, that we didn't need to go into the parking garage. I was so angry at the blatant ripoff!! BUT didn't know what to do! I still can't escape the feeling of him not stopping the car when I asked him to!"
oh the taxi horror stories .. It just keeps getting worse.
