"I'm sure the answer is somewhere in this forum already, but there are so many threads about so many different types of visas and related situations that I cannot find it.Very simply: We are US citizens already in Vietnam on 30-day E-visas. We are considering staying longer but can't figure out if it's possible to extend or renew this type of visa.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
Drop into a travel agent and they will tell you your options. It can be done.
"Thanks, do you know how long it might take?Also, can it be done without a travel agent?"
"That's the problem on how long it will take. If doing it in Saigon or Hanoi likely a few days other places longer. If not doing it through a travel agent you would have to go to an immigration office, good luck with that."
Thanks a lot. Appreciate your responses.
Let us know how you get on.
"Well, unfortunately I'll never know: ""Vietnam to halt issue of all visas over coronavirusPUBLISHED : 17 MAR 2020 AT 14:12REUTERS""https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1880625/viâ€¦"
At the moment visa extensions are still possible. That could change soon the way things are going.
"Very good to know, thanks. Didn't risk it, myself. Took a last-minute flight out yesterday. All the regulations are just changing way too fast, in this entire region."
