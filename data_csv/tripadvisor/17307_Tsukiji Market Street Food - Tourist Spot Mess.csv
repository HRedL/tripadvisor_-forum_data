"Just visited Tsukiji Market and boy has it changed from 6 years ago.Made a quick video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=096In6pRlwsI can swear 6 years ago, everyone walked through the wholesale area, then visited a restaurant in the outer market to eat to go home.Now, * they separated out to keep the tourists out of the wholesale area.* they say no photography in the wholesale area because it interrupts with business* they are trying to push all tourists to the outer market* I feel the prices in the touristy areas are kind of high now too* oh, the auction? You'd have to be lining up at 2am to watch a few minutes of auction, I don't think it's worth it.That all said, it was still fun."
"Well, we didn't have hordes of tourists coming into the inner market until several years ago. Then they came en mass. Many with strollers and luggage and some with bad manners--touching fish, jumping onto moving carts, taking hundreds of pictures with flush and buying nothing. So the Tsukiji business association was forced to set new rules. Remember that Tsukiji, especially the inner market is NOT a tourist attraction, but a place of serious business and many peoples' livelihood depend on it. It's the biggest fish market in the world which caters to 12+ million Tokyo residents and 10,000+ restaurants. It can't afford to have many ill-mannered tourists fooling around. If you're buying something, you can still get into the inner market before 10am."
"While it is still the largest fish market, it has been in decline for a few years and is a place of business - tourists are not welcome because of their bad behavior and probably that will be one of the things the operators will like when the market moves next year. What often is not reported is a growing trend for fish wholesalers to simply bypass the place. Also, while the new site has it's issues being build on a polluted site, the current place is also polluted and has a healthy population of large brown rats."
"Exactly as Shibuyakko put it--Tsukiji's inner market wholesale area isn't meant to be a business attraction. They don't make money by letting visitors go inside. Therefore, tourists are secondary. If this is another country, they would already be charging money to for the visit and the auction.Another beside the sheer number of visitors was probably their selfie sticks. People want to ""check-in"" all the time at attractions with no consideration for others around them. There is actually pretty good discussions about selfies in front of famous museum artworks in a couple of the European forums. When I went to Tsukiji's inner market years ago, I had no problem taking photos of huge tuna--a stall owner even helped me arrange a better angle. I suspect those days are long gone.As far as the outer market, it's always built for the end consumers. Years ago, many of the visitors used to be locals. These days, with the explosion of Tsukiji popularity, it gets jam packed from 10am onwards. That's why I often recommend visitors to go early. I usually eat something there by 8am as the outer market stores are just opening. By 9am+, it starts to get crowded. From 10am onwards, it's just packed. That's when I finish my shopping and leave."
"I hear you guys. Sorry to add to the tourism =PThe outer market did seem like they safeguarded themselves pretty well against rude people like everything was either carefully watched or wrapped or just protected behind glass so people can't go around touching or ""sampling"" them. and now that you mention it, I don't think I heard much Japanese in the outer market."
I didn’t want to start a new thread. So is it worth visiting tsukji market as a tourist? Or would you suggest someone with limited time to go elsewhere. I’m a huge sashimi and sushi fan btw.
I am also curious what time I should arrive to eat since I have an early arrival flight
"If you're going to a sushi shop in the inner market, you may go any time. Many of them open at 5-5:30am. Some people start queueing up around 3am at Shushi Dai and Daiwa Sushi, etc."
"Robert, I think it's still a fun stop. As Sammy said, before 10am would be best to avoid the huge crowd. Even with the huge crowd though, most people are just window shopping and it's easy to buy everything without wait. Restaurants had a wait though."
"Most outer market restaurants have a much more reasonable queue vs Sushi Dai or Sushi Daiwa. Still, if you arrive too late, you could be in line for an hour or so. I usually arrive between 8-9am with a minimal line."
Thanks kenji - I will visit but not make it too important part of my day.
"No problem Robert!Thanks SammyF1oyd! I agree with this on many tourist areas. Even in Dotombori (Osaka), you'll see a looong line for restaurants and you walk a block and see the exact same restaurant with no one. ""location, location, location"" being demonstrated."
You can still get world class sushi all over town. The freshness of the fish being right out of the water is not the main thing if you want regular sushi (not sashimi). If the rice isn't made properly then it is ruined anyway. Japan is the sushi capital of the world and fantastic sushi can be had in many places all over Tokyo.
"A couple of years ago was when I first noticed Namba has become very crowded. We were walking around trying to find a place to eat, and there were lines everywhere. We ended up taking a quick subway ride to Tennoji--no lines! It was wonderful. I think visitors who have only gone on a couple visits should still hang out at Namba and Dotonbori. I have made Tennoji my base last time, and I will do so again in a couple of months.>>>Even in Dotombori (Osaka), you'll see a looong line for restaurants and you walk a block and see the exact same restaurant with no one. ""location, location, location"" being demonstrated.Interestingly, some fish needs to be aged (a bit like meat) to get the best taste. I am no expert in this matter though. Anyway, for budget to mid-range stuff, I do find that Tsukiji tends to have better quality. However, for the really great places, they are more likely to be located in Ginza and other more expensive spots of Tokyo.>>>You can still get world class sushi all over town.

"SammyFloyd....do you know if these sushi places at the outer market are clean because I read the market attracts many rats?Also, do people actually eat sushi first thing in the morning for breakfast? Many thanks for your insight .....with appreciation....cliu"
Bummer! Must be a recent restriction. We were there in 2015 and were able to go inside the market. Some vendors allowed us to take photos and some got very irritated. We definitely respected their wishes and certainly could understand how annoying we (tourists) could be if trying to work and somebody was taking our photo. We will be there in December. I wonder if it will be crowded...Edited: 2 years ago 
You can still go inside the market but no earlier than 10am.Expect crowds regardless of day of visit.
I am sure the freezers and fridges where the fish is kept are sealed from rodents. Most of them are around digging in the trash and the scraps. everything I see is packed up really tight after closing and sealed pretty good. I never heard of anyone I know ever getting sick from sushi in Tsukiji or anywhere...except me...but I once got food poisoning from a veggie sandwich so....I have a strange constitution.
"Wherever there is food, there are rats and other bugs, most likely including your favorite, high-end restaurant back home. There is no real epidemic that I know of though."

Having based myself at Tennoji I got a fantastic place with only a downside of having to travel to Umeda for the free day trips using a JR Pass (there is some noise from the cars and trains, but I have a major thoroughfare under my windows at home so that doesn't really bother me). Shinsekai is a really quaint and fun little shopping and amusement area, and I was even given a discount on the fresh persimmon yesterday (sold off a sushi shop, to my surprise)!Edited: 2 years ago "

"1) Taxi is the only way. 2) What a timing! The market is going to move and open at the new site in Toyosu on October 11, 2018! There are lots of newspaper article in Japanese, I'm sure you can find some in English. Here is one in Japanese:sankei.com/politics/…plt1712200038-n1.htmlYou don't have to get there 3am. I don't think there will be a tuna auction or anything on the first day at the new site. Popular sushi shops such as Sushi Dai and Daiwa Sushi open at 5-5:30am.More info regarding the operation at the new site will come in later. 3) Don't know if you can really learn making sushi by just watching. But you shouldn't film the whole process if you go to a popular sushi shop as there always are long queue. They don't want you to linger."
"To make proper sushi, you will need to take a class. There is a lot of knowledge on knife skills, rice cooking, and the assembly process. It's not something you can just film and learn.A lot of visitors take videos these days though so as long as you aren't holding up the queue, then you can take your time. It's unlikely that you would want to linger at more popular places like Sushi Dai and Sushi Daiwa."
Would you say it’s not sanitary to eat there? We booked a food tour.
Eat where? You shouldn’t have any food issues in Japan.
