I have booked a P&O Cruise to Barbados 4/1/15 - 22/1/15.I have heard there is an epidemic of Chikungunya in the Caribbean but have not been told this by P & O. Should I cancel my trip?
There is an outbreak of chikungunya through the Caribbean. Barbados are taking it seriously and are fogging. There is a big thread below on the topic. There has been no UK travel advice advising not to travel but they do advise if you have any underlying health issues to seek advice from your doctor before travel. I think if you are a normal healthy person and use deet repellent you should be fine. It will also be getting further into dry season which will hopefully mean fewer mozzies about. A friend of mine went on a Caribbean cruise in November and had no issues.
Peggy BI wouldn't be worried about the virus. Be sure to pack your insect repellents and use them regularly. You will be fine.Regards
"If you cancel your trip it is unlikely that your insurance company will refund your money as there is no DOH or FO advice not to travel, and P and O are not cancelling the cruise.As everyone says take normal precautions and enjoy yourself."
"I have just got back from Barbados, i made sure i used plenty of mozzie repellant and i didnt actually get bitten once! my mom and friend had a couple of bites but they are fine.i would no way let it stop me from going, in fact i cant wait to go back. dont cancel, enjoy yourself and as the other posters said, just take normal precautions. it was the millipedes that bothered me more than the mozzies anyway!! (or christmas worms as one of my local friends told me they were more commonly known as)!!"
The rate of infection has thankfully dropped quite considerably since Sept/Oct and I agree that if you take sensible precautions you should be fine.
"this is carried by mosquitos, and there are no mosquitos in barbados in January"
this is transmitted by mosquitos and there are no mosquitos in barbados in Jan and Feb
There is mosquitos in Barbados all year round !
"I was quite ill prior to travel and my doctor said he was determined to get me on the plane if he had to carry me! I THINK he was joking. I am mobility impaired and also have a life-limiting lung disease but I always feel much better in the Barbados sunshine. Hubs, who used to get terribly bitten, and I take a LOT of mozzie precautions now, mainly due to the great advice on this forum. We start taking Vitamin B1 a month before travel and eat Marmite every day. On the day of travel and throughout our holiday we use a base of Avon skin so soft dry body oil as a base then add a 50% Deet spray followed by wearing anti-mozzie ankle bands 24 hours a day. We keep a fan running 24 hours a day in our room and block the bottom of the door with a towel overnight so that nothing can crawl in. It all sounds WAY OTT but this time I got away without a single bite, hubs only had a couple. I wonder if more folk are taking precautions against mozzies as we only saw one person covered in bites all week, usually there are a lot of folk with nasty bites.W-D"
"We are going in Feb also and pleased to hear that much less chance of catching it as less mossies then.. Haven't been before, but going out for my sister's wedding with our 12 year old daughter.. Will bring plenty Deet spray anyway."
Hate to tell you I get bitten every February.
"Not all mossies carry the Chickungunya bug, I got bitten a few times but didn't have any ill effects."
Same here JGDerYak but fortunately no ill effects.I agree with GEM - I have been bitten in January and February in Barbados.
"If you have been reading the Daily Wail sorry Mail, usual alarmist melodramatic out of date information. Some might even say irresponsible. Chickununya is still around but waning in most areas of the West Indies.Dengue has been around for years and potentially far more serious but few panicked about that. Make sure you use mossie repellant with deet during the day as well as evening and hopefully you won't have a problem"
"I still think it seems to me a lot of people are saying they have had chik which is questionable. Our housekeeper said she had it - not too bad, only lasted 3 or 4 days and was able to keep on working!??? - but she doesn't know for sure as she didn't have a blood test. Like many other locals she was not prepared to pay $100 for a test. How can they possibly get accurate numbers on this unless they provide a test for free? All I can say is that at the moment I have not seen one mosquito in 3 days - consequently not one bite. Yes, I think it is sensible to be prudent and spray yourself and use vap mats etc - however, I feel I'm not going to ruin my trip by worrying about all the hype!"
"We were in Barados in Oct/Nov. We rented a house for five of us. We also rented a car and travelled the island.We used 50% deet and also Avon so soft body oil. My 22 year old daughter came down with chickungunya on the second week. She was bed bound for sixdays her joints were very painful so were her muscles, she had headaches and a painful rash all over her body. Her foot turned in and she struggled to walk to the bathroom for the duration of the virus. On the 7th day she recovered and we travelled home. Two days after arriving home my husband came down with the same symptoms he was ill for three weeks. He is still suffering now with aches and pains in his joints, fingers particularly and knee. His doctor sent him to the Tropical diseases dept at Hospital. They took blood tests for Chickungunya Dengue Malaria and onset of Athritis because of the Virus. We are waiting for the results. We are returning to Barbados in March, we love the country and 90% of the people there who are wonderful, this will be our 4th time. I hope Barbados are on top of the situation now and feel happy to go because it is the dry season and there shouldn't be as many mozzies about. Come on people of Barbadoscheck your backyards for stagnant water and the gardens of empty houses, we love coming to your country we love to rent houses not all inclusive hotels we want to contribute to your economy by eating and drinking out in the local bars and restaurants and shopping centres and oohhh those beaches! Can't wait to get back!"
"Gashead - so sorry to hear of your family's ill heath - do check that the house you rent does regular ""fogging' to control the mosquitoes (our condos eg. have the grounds fogged 3 times a week - plus the Govt conducts fogging all over the island too) - Fogging does help kill them off - but as you so rightly state - Chik is an urban disease - and litter that contains rainfall is the ideal breeding ground for them - also the chik mossies live in homes - i.e. indoors - not just outdoors - so indoor spraying with insecticide is required too -"
"So sorry to hear this, Gashead. I know I was lucky when I was bitten in November because whatever it was clearly wasn't carrying Chik or Dengue. I wore 50% DEET too and I think I missed a bit of skin on my arm or it rubbed off? I don't know. I'll be taking the same precautions again next month. Hopefully it'll be drier with less breeding opportunities for the little blighters. I hope your family recover well."
Been here a month and haven't seen a mosquito or had a bite. Don't worry. Use repellant if you are concerned.
Hi Just check the Barbados news paper called Caribbean360 and then check an organisation for the Caribbean called CARPHA We were due to go to Barbados and decided to cancel also check the FO who say 'you can go but wear long sleeve shirts long trousers a hat and SHOES no sandals and plenty of Deet Still going?
"Re Chikungunya If you are over 65 and suffer from arthritis you should be very wary about going to areas where this type of mosquito breeds. There is no known vaccine for their infection and the incubation period is between 2 and 12 days.The hospital for tropical diseases in London, I understand has setup a section for treating 'infection' in the rheumatology ward as the symptoms are very similar to arthritis and tests are needed to ascertain whether you have the virus or not. On that note, however much one wants to go to the Caribbean I still think caution is called for as the long term effects of been infected can last years. Check it out!."
Just go to the web site cdc.gov/chikungunya Where all will be revealed
"normansky1,do you ever leave your house ? you must be a load of fun to live with."
You are advised to take those precautions in any country where there is a risk of being bitten by mossies.
I don't think you would enjoy Barbados Normansky-----------it's a fun place !
"Since we have had a winter home here since 1989 - and since we are now in residence back in the warm - what do you expect us to do Normansky? - my hubbie is a WW2 veteran - aged 90 - naturally he has arthritis - so we use Deet spray and wipes and keep our fingers crossed - ensure the place is fogged regularly, use insecticide indoors if/when we see a mossie - ..... we can either go on living our life as best we can in our so called 'sunset years"" - or -what? - curl up and hibernate in the north, and hope to live eternally? -;pity, but no one lives forever.... anywhere"
Yes I do leave my house. Perhaps you should check on professional health sites that I have listed in my message and then make a more informed comment. I see no point of walking blindly into a widely acknowledge infested problem area.
"I would risk ChikV many times over rather than spend winters in Canada and contracting one flu virus after another. The health benefits of living in Barbados, in spite of this disease, in my opinion, far outwiegh the effects of the disease. Plus, winter is very hard on individuals of advance age; I watched my grandparents and parents hide away for much of the winter, being very unhappy."
What are people going to do when Chikungunya moves into other regions? It never use to be in Barbados so do Bajans now hide in there homes and don't go out? Use common sense and spray.
"Normansky 1 - if you would care to check back on this forum and type Chikungunya Disease in the search, you will see several 'threads' on this disease - one is 48 pages long!! There is absolutely nothing in the link you have given that tells us anything new, it has been discussed inside out and back to front over and over again, including posts by people who have had the disease. Have a look.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Normansky ----You have chosen to cancel your holiday to Barbados because there is a small risk of you catching Chikengunya , your decision, and a shame for you, BUT, may I ask why you booked to holiday there in the first place, when Dengue , a far worse virus, which is also mosquito born , and has been on the Island for years and years..  Visitors have always taken precautions against being bitten, to keep themselves from getting Dengue so now is really no different. I take no precautions other than burning Citronella Candles in my house , because I am allergic to products containing DEET . I tried Avon Skin so Soft then gave up and I did catch Chik in early November. I suffer from two forms of Arthritis and consequently take daily medication for it, and as my medication is more or less what is prescribed for the treatment of Chik, my symptoms were much reduced to only stiffness in my legs and pain in my shoulder, which lasted 5 days and really stopped me from doing very little. I returned to the UK the second week in December and contracted Pneumonia around Christmas, and am only just starting to really recover , although I am still very tired all the time. The cold is affecting my Arthritis and I am, quite frankly longing to get back to the healing warmth of Barbados next week.  You warn people with Arthritis not to travel to Barbados, but I can only assume that you do not suffer from this crippling disease yourself, otherwise you would not hesitate to choose the health benefits afforded by that wonderful Island with it's constant temperatures and guaranteed sunshine . Enjoy the Winter in the cold, I shall be on the beach, pain free.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Your decision Normanski after all it's your health and you are right to have concerns.I have had chickV and believe me it is not nice, fortunately I only got the symptoms when I was back in the UK, it definitely would have ruined a week of my holiday and as I already have an existing medical condition I was glad to be in the care of my excellent GP. However, my husband and many friends who were with us did not get as much as an itch!Maybe you will consider Barbados in the future.Edited: 5 years ago "
"You guys are all right. However, to those who need to be careful I see no reason why they should not be properly informed (as I was) and to make their own decision whether to go to the Carribean or not. At least I've high lighted a situation that the majority of people going to the Caribbean were not aware of. Incidentally a friend and his young son who works in Bridgetown went down with this virus and months later is still suffering with joint pain. So you 'pays your money and takes your choice' That's all from me!See you in Barbados!!"
"Westie - sounds like you have had the awful cold / flu bug that just about everyone in the UK (including me) has had over the festive period. Our friend's daughter had it and ended up with pneumonia too. I am still coughing, so can't wait to soak up some Bajan sun on March."
"You are right DanL , I thought it was flu at first but being an asthma sufferer, it turned much worse. Not the best ""Festive Season "" I have had, but ""home"" soon and all will be well I'm sure."
"I'm doubtful that there are credible sources that have suggested that that Barbados is widely infested with ChicV. @27, perhaps you can point out where you saw this statement. I agree that it is your choice to go or not to go, it's just that there is a pattern on this forum of single post members stirring the pot on this (and other) topics and certainly that is the case wrt the reopening of this thread."
so true smokey!
"Sorry you got sick in the UK, Westie; I have a similar reaction to extreme cold at home: I'm ok if the temps don't go below zero, but in the minuses (right now it's minus 25 with windchill) I feel horrible - lethargic, headachy, sore muscles.. In Barbados I used a natural repellent because I can't take DEET either; I used lemon eucalyptus essential oils mixed with water in a small spray bottle and did not get Chik. I saw essential oils at Massy's after mine ran out, and noticed they were much cheaper than at home as well."
"Well having read the article in the Daily Mail, the day after we booked a cruise, I paniced and cancelled, losing £100.!! however I am now so annoyed that we did this, had we not read the paper we would have been completely unaware and now be looking forward to a wonderful cruise.I want to rebook but hubby is saying wait till next winter!!"
Everybody starts off as a first time poster - why the need to attack? If it was my first trip to the West Indies then I would be concerned about health issues.
"Elias,i can't believe you trusted the Daily Mail. They are the biggest scaremongers out there. Normansky,your scaremongering is as bad as the Daily Mail. April will be my first time in Barbados.I will be spending some time watching the Cricket. If things were as bad as you and the Daily Mail make out,do you think England would be touring ? The ECB haven't mentioned anything.Edited: 5 years ago "

"JaneE (and other posters) of course you would/should be concerned about health issues but wouldn't you have done your research before booking. I can't imagine people would book trips to places they have never been to without checking the government websites (and sites like this one) regarding crime, health requirements, local customs etc.. The Canadian, American and UK sites all mention chick (as well as dengue, a far more severe disease) for Barbados, and most islands, but none of them have issued a 'travel warning', just an advisory. If this situation was serious don't you think at least one (if not all three) sites would have posted a 'do not travel'???This topic has been discussed ad nauseam, isn't it time to give it a rest?It's a shame Elias that you lost £100 and now you don't have a vacation to look forward to because you panicked but I bet you learned something from the experience. Book Barbados for you next trip, I am sure you will love it.You said it ASO!Edited: 5 years ago "
:)
NC of course I would research a country I had never visited previously. Not everyone does and not everyone reads Trip Advisor. I was contemplating a trip to West Africa but because of the health warnings I have put it on hold.
Were the health warnings for west Africa about Ebola Jane ? If so then that is hardly comparable with Chik v as it has left thousands of fatalities in it's wake.
I never hinted that it was comparable with chikungunya and never would. I was merely stating that I put off my intended visit because of health warnings issued by my government. If such warnings had been published by my government regarding Chicv then I would have heeded that warning and cancelled any planned visit. I have never tried to put anyone off visiting Barbados because of Chikv.
"No I'm sure you haven't - I felt sorry the woman who read the Daily Mail was frightened and cancelled her cruise - maybe it is because we are not British, but every time the Daily Mail comes here and I see a copy I find it very ""sensationalistic"""
"ASO,Totally agree and also find the Daily Mail very depressing !!Regards"

It depends on the paper!
"I just returned from a week in Barbados and I must say that I have never seen it so mosquito free, even though there was a bit of early morning rain several times. The efforts at mosquito control certainly seemed to me to be working."
"I agree . The authorities have taken the issue seriously and deserve great credit.Barbados, jewel of the Caribbean sea!!"
That's great to hear DEA. It's a shame that's not reported over here.
"The authorities have been fighting the mosquitoes for decades on account of dengue - now private owners are fogging too - the population is more aware - and it is true - there are far less mossies around now than usual - - luckily the fact that Barbados is a small island we would imagine, has helped in this regard, as places like the DR - Jamaica etc. are so huge that fogging etc. must be really much harder to organize."
"Ok...I'm getting on the Chik-V bandwagon. I have had dengue and that was the sickest I have ever been. I also have arthritis and for all the reasons stated above about the health benefits of the weather in Barbados, I would not hesitate to go to. In fact, I usually go twice a year and have had times when I get many bites and other times when I rarely get any. I traveled to Cuba in October and the same warnings were out there. I was ravaged with bites as it was a swampy area but alas, did not contact Chik-V. Life in a bubble is not fun so my choice is take precautions and be sensible but live your life while you're able...rant done."
Right on Rootsie - Life is for the living - it is Not a Rehearsal .... :)
"Hi All Yes I feel a bit of a twit cancelling the cruise, it was a total over reaction and we really regret doing it. To be fair to myself ,the fact that mossies find me irresistible (haha!!) was what frightened me, I really should have known better. What's done is done but now I spend my days trying to find another holiday!!! There is still time to find me back on the cruise but its now dearer than the price I paid!!!!"
Elias...just book a holiday in Barbados and forego the cruise. You'll have more fun anyway LOL
We are out in Barbados now. We got paranoid listening to a couple in Boots at airport. They were really worried about visiting Barbados. So we got a bottle of mozzie repellant. Never bought the stuff before. Here 10 days now. Nothing. Put stuff on first day. Never bothered since. Must be luck of the draw. We did 3 weeks last January. Nothing. It must be my dodgy aftershave/deodorant I use!!
We cancelled our trip to Barbados and went to Costa Rico where there is no Chikungunya. Had a wonderful time! We heard from friends living in Barbados that it's a big problem and didn't want to worry about the children getting it!
"Bad news family of travellers, its in Costa Rica as well.Info herewww.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/americas.html"
It was in Costa Rica long before Barbados and the 'outbreak' is much worse there than in Barbados.
Wonder who informed them there was no outbreak in Costa Rica ? My son just returned from there and because they were doing treks thru rain forests etc they were informed and armed !!!
"Another one post wonder, well actuall two posts, both about ChicV. Even the most cynical of regulars here must see the pattern!"
"Unfortunately it looks like these parents didn't do any research before travelling with kids, a dicey practice IMO. If they had checked with the CDC or PAHO online they would have read that chik was indeed in Costa Rica as it is in most tropical and sub tropical countries."
"I wonder if Peggy, the original ( I post ) poster 7 pages ago, actually cancelled her trip in the end ??"
I used lemon eucalyptus essentil oils for two weeks and was fine. There weren't all that many mossies anyway.
"I came armed with bottles of DEET spray. I use it out of paranoia in the evenings, but have only seen 2 Mosquitos in the week we've been here. My hubby refuses to use it. HUGE mistake to cancel a trip over Chik-V in Barbados, IMHO!"
"Canby, aspirin is certainly not the best advice if not well I case it is dengue. Haemorrhaging could be an issue .Luvstovake, whilst most mozzies bite in the evening, the mosquito which brings ChikV bites during the day."
"@damasust - think that was a Canadian ""in joke"" - docs always say if one is lucky enough to get them on the phone - ""take 2 Aspirins and called me in the morning"": - meaning ""oh don't bother me with silly little things"" :)- but being serious - of course you are correct - never take aspirin always take Tylenol"
"So ASO and canby,chikungunya is a ""silly little thing"""
"No JGDerYAK.. chik-v is not a silly little thing.. but these posts are running their course.. all sorts of info all over the place the internet. in newspapers etc.. correct or incorrect.. it's there. 76 (now 77) replies certainly doesn't beat the record.. but it's getting a little tiresome.. I still have 3 children firmly attached to the ground in Barbados who haven't contracted this virus.. and neither myself or my husband (although he is still fairly certain he had it in his big toe). I have.. however, contracted the nasty head cold/cough virus.. that seems to linger for likely about as long as the Chik-V.(think extended period rather than the 3 or 4 day kind) . better stay away because of that.. or .. more likely you will catch it where you live.. as that virus was likely an import.. have a nice day.."
"Sunnie, the reason that all these threads appear and keep running is the lack of direct information. If there was a webpage (or any other form of information) that gave visitors facts and figures showing how small the chance of catching it was (providing the correct precautions are taken) then all this wouldn't be necessary, we would just point people at the information and let them decide.I have never said don't travel because of ChicV unless you have some pre-existing medical condition that would make catching it a serious matter.Just for your info I am travelling this year to UAE, Vietnam, USA (two trips planned, Washington DC and Florida) oh and Caribbean at some point) UAE has an outbreak of MERS at the moment but they have provided clear advice on its cause and how to avoid it, job done.Look and learn."
"IMO any traveller should be doing his own research before travel. The CDC, Health Canada and the equivalent in the UK are there for a reason. All the info required is on all three sites (and PAHO) as well as that for dengue, a far more serious disease. Surely people can be responsible for their own health and read up on this stuff before they travel."
"NC1, If there was a webpage that people could go to that showed how many visitors came to the island in a year against how many people had suspected cases and how many confirmed cases it would put many peoples mind at rest. For example (and these are not factual numbers)Barbados has 500,000 visitors each year plus 750,000 cruise ship day visitors. 1,500 suspected cases of chickV were reported out of these 500 were confirmed. The chances of getting ChickV are relatively small, you can make them smaller by following these guide lines blah blahThe government have an anti-mosquito programme in place that consists of the following blah blahIf you are unlucky and contract it in a normally healthy adult it takes x days to run its courseYou can see where I am going with this, then anyone who comes onto this site in a flap about chickV can have some facts to look at instead of locals dismissing it as some trivia.Edited: 5 years ago "
"JGD all that information is available on the PAHO site while the three gov't sites mentioned offer ways to protect ones self, symptoms (I think) etc. If the tree gov'ts thought this was a serious health issue they would have posted ""do not travel"" warnings. They have not. If you think the gov't of Barbados is going to post a site as you suggest, it's not going to happen. Has any other Caribbean or Central American gov't done so, in effect repeating the work three much larger and wealthier gov'ts have already done? As I remember all the information you have asked for has already been posted in other chik threads. A search of 'chikungunya' should pull it up. Problem is people don't use the search feature and just start up another thread instead to re-hash all that has already been posted.As I said, the information is out there I think it is the responsibility of the travelling public to do his research and be responsible for themselves and use the information provided by their, or other, governments. Just my opinion."
A friend is leaving for DR tomorrow morning and I asked her if she was aware of Chikungunya and she had no idea what so ever. Now here is a popular location which many more people go to and has a higher rate of cases and yet it is not even known by tourist. Goes to show what people search before booking.Edited: 5 years ago 
Gem that doesn't surprise me in the slightest
Me either. I guess they figure dress codes and taxi fares more important (if they researched at all).
@GEM - no wonder the DR has more than half a million suspected cases - hope you warned your friend to stock up on OFF
Yes I did mention it to her last night at work and she was going to pick so up before leaving for Toronto today. Another friend going to Costa Rica in March was aware of it.Oh I forgot wasn't there a post that it wasn't there ;). All I know is I will take precautions as I get bitten all the time. I am aware it is Barbados and 40 other Countries. I want to vacation and I will go and enjoy my holidays and what happens happens. Can't live in a bubble and one day it will be in Canada. Just another thing in life we need to deal with and not hibernate from.Bring on Barbados I need to get away from this cold. :)
I'm taking a friend to Barbados last two weeks in August.Now I'm thinking this is the top time for bites? What is the status now? we're staying in Bridgetown.I doubt very much she'll want to cover up but I told her to spray.
"I have not heard of anyone getting Chik for months---------------but I would still advise your friend to use Mossie repellent as Dengue is always lurking in the background, so there is no point in taking risks."
I think herd immunity is in place now... ie there is no one with active chik for the mosquitoes to bite so they can not transfer it to another person. I agree with Westie dengue is still around so take precautions.
In Barbados now.I'm am very tasty too Mozzies.Had a couple of bites on West coast last week despite spraying within an inch of my life. Probably Sandflies but for me reaction is worse.However have to say there certainly seems to be less Mozzies around and there is more fogging and general advice to local public which had helped the situation. Keep on spraying and you will be ok.
@damasust - if they were bright red and very itchy - sandflies!Edited: 5 years ago 
"Well you have heard it from the expert, nothing to worry about in Barbados.I'm pleased to know it's gone. Is that the same for Grenada ?"
Enlighten me JGD. Who is the expert?
"ASDO.Surely you knew that,damasust!!"
I am anything but an expert and have never pretended to be - so I assume that is sarcasm
"I was there a couple of weeks ago, but despite rain,the mozzie situation seemed reasonable, my wife and I used Jungle Formula......she had a couple of bites and I was fine. They did fog around the apartment once,Problems seem well controlled."
"I was three weeks ago on the south coast and I didn't get one bite! I did make sure that I put on mosquito repellent though, especially at night. I didn't notice any mosquitos."
