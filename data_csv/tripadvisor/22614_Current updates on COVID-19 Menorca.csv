"I will post relevant info to help people with their immediate travel plans to Menorca on this new thread, so it stays current. Yesterday the following information was published:“Those who arrive in the Balearic Islands from areas of Spain or other countries at risk from coronavirus must stay at home for at least 15 days, in isolation, to prevent the spread of the disease. The President of the Government, Francina Armengol , made this recommendation on Friday at a press conference, after announcing that the Balearic establishments are closed as a new preventive measure .”Please bear this in mind if you are travelling to the island via mainland Spain, whether by air or driving through and arriving by ferry in the next two weeks.For info on the situation across the whole of Spain, www.rtve.es has useful figures, a live feed and map of cases which is updated hourly."
That is very helpful QS1. I see that the number of Spanish cases is rising noticeably so you can understand why the Balearic regional government is taking serious measures to protect themselves
"New information that has just been reported locally and nationally.“Balearic Islands already registers 44 cases of coronavirus . This was reported this morning at a press conference by the Minister of Health Patricia Gómez .The Govern has indicated that this Friday 18 new cases were registered in the Balearic Islands.”In truly informative reporting style, they have omitted to let us know the new figures by island."
"Thanks Quality spy for your updates most helpful, lets try and keep this current thread at the top the posts ."
"Many thanks. At the moment the papers online are reporting that they are unable to release any details about which islands are affected the new infections. Trying to read through the details of the current nationwide lockdown, it seems people can go to work or the supermarket, but nowhere else."
"Majorca has confirmed 17 cases of coronavirus, while Menorca has three and Ibiza has oneAccording to The Sun on the 13th March."
Presume this applies to MenorcaSpain's central government has decreed a restriction of movement order to combat the spread of the coronavirus.You will only be permitted on the streets for the following reasons:Going to or from work.Going to buy foodGoing to the bankGoing to Doctor/Hospital/PharmacyGoing to assist Elderly/Disabled/Sick/These restrictions come into effect according to the decree on Monday 16th March.at 08.00.In addition the following establishments will be closed.Entertainment venuesCultural and Educational facilitiesSports facilities.CasinosZoosBars/Cafes/Restaurants/shops(non food)/ commercial premises.Basically anywhere where the public congregate.Public transport will run at a greater reduced service.The public are reminded to respect individuals personal space and apply the not closer than 1 metre rule.Restrictions are expected to be in place for at least two weeks.Hopefully QS can confirm this.
"Yes that's correct. All of Spain and the islands are in total lock down as of 8am Monday. It will be enforced by the Guardia, nacional and local policía. The army can be mobilised if required. There are now 44 cases as of today across the three islands. When the distribution figures are published I will update you."
"This looks a tad worrying:“ The Government will allow the intervention of companies or services, as well as the mobilization of the State Security Forces and Bodies and the Armed Forces to guarantee food supply during the state of alarm, according to the decree for the management of the health crisis caused for the coronavirus and approved this Saturday by the extraordinary Council of Ministers.The norm establishes that the competent authorities may adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the food supply in the places of consumption and the operation of the services of the production centers, allowing the distribution of food from the origin to the commercial establishments of sale to the consumer, including warehouses, logistics centers and destination markets.If it is necessary for security reasons, the decree establishes that the accompaniment of the vehicles that carry the food transport may be agreed.”I do have some doubts about how our island’s (always fragile) supply system will be maintained here."
"Just heard the restrictions have been moved forward and are in place with immediate effect, 8am UK time."
"Hi, it would make sense but it hasn’t hit news live feeds here as yet. Could you give me the source of the info if poss?"
"Still nothing showing on spanish TV channels or on live news feeds, saying that the decree has been changed. It is safe to say that even yesterday everywhere was deserted and most shops were closed in Mahon and Ciutadella according to the local paper and photos."
Now found it! Restriction of movement along all highways and public roads was enforced as of midnight. Crazy amount of conflicting info in the press and some regions on the mainland brought in their own additional measures like condoning off beaches. This will not be pleasant.
"Today’s figures have just been published. Across all 3 islands there are now a total of 55 cases. All bar 3 which are here on Menorca, and 2 on Ibiza are on Mallorca.That is good news for Menorca, but not for Mallorca. There will be no further updates published today, so will post again tomorrow. Cheers ."
"We are expecting another update on numbers at around 1pm our time. The lockdown is being enforced even here in deserted Son Bou. The handful of people who went to the beach yesterday without a mascota/pet, were sent packing by a couple of policemen. (We can see the beach car park from our home). Cheers for now."
"Thanks for the updates, get more info from you than the media!!"
That's because she lives there and is in the middle of the shutdown Gerard! The restrictions sound hard to live under but if it helps you have to do what you are told!
"No new figures for the islands yet, but a statement from the government this morning is reproduced below:“ The Transport Minister, José Luis Ábalos , has taken for granted this Monday the extension of the state of alarm beyond the days initially planned by the Government to deal with the coronavirus pandemic .""It is evident that we will have to extend this situation, we will see with what measures , but in fifteen days I do not think that we are capable of winning this battle,"" Ábalos admitted in an interview on RNE. He has warned that such an extension could lead to even more severe measures than those already taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus .”Sub text....it’s going to get a whole lot worse and the quarantine in force now will not be lifted at the end of March.Edited: 7:10 am, March 16, 2020 "
I'm currently in hospital mateu orfila. My surgeon informed me that the island has 7 diagnosed cases as of this morning. 4 admitted here in the hospital and 3 treated at home.
"Total cases across the 3 islands have been reported nationally: Islas BalearesEn Baleares hay 73 casos entre Mallorca, Menorca e Ibiza.It was 55 yesterday. Nothing updated in the local Menorca or Mallorca papers online to say where yet. As of 1pm today over a thousand new cases have been confirmed across Spain since midnight. The country now has the dubious honour of making the top four countries for contagions."
Thanks Derek. That’s not good news. My husband should attend the hospital for outpatient cardiology check but has cancelled. Safer at home. Stay well.
That you for keeping us up to date guys
"I really can't fault the doctors and nurses treating me, 100% professionals. Atmosphere is good, patients are being discharged as soon as is safe to do so. Accident and emergency department has seen a few flare ups between patients and staff but nothing serious and the department is generally quietThe cafeteria is doing food to take away only, beyond that there's always the vending machines!"
"Message from the presidenta of the Government of the Baleares made today. translated by google from Spanish:The Govern made an appeal on Monday for national and international tourists who are in the Balearic Islands to leave the archipelago and has advocated for the orderly closure of hotels until the coronavirus health emergency is overcome .""We will give them all the facilities so that they can leave,"" said the regional president, Francina Armengol , at a press conference , who pointed out that ""it does not make any sense"" that visitors remain on the islands ""locked"" in their accommodation. Armengol has stated that he trusts that today the Ministry of Public Works will approve his request for ""almost absolute restriction"" on the movements of national and international flights at Balearic airports.For the head of the regional executive, only the necessary air transport services must be maintained so that the Balearics who are abroad can return home and make essential trips to the peninsula.End of press report. For he, read she as the president is a woman!Edited: 11:02 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Fingers crossed this all starts to settle down soon for everyone, it’s the dreaded unknown. Keep well everyone."
"Finally today’s figures have been confirmed as per a press conference this afternoon.“The Balearic Islands have 18 new cases of coronavirus and they will continue to increase over the next 7-10 days. This was announced this Monday afternoon by the spokesman for the Balearic Government's coronavirus monitoring alert committee , Francesc Albertí.Of the new cases, 14 are in Mallorca and three in Menorca, one affected is admitted to the Mateu Orfila hospital and the other two are in their homes with active surveillance. Hospitalized patients follow a stable course; in Mallorca there are three in the serious ICU.”So, small numbers on Menorca so far amongst a population of around 98,000 residents. But, it has been noticed and there are comments in the press about people from the mainland who own holiday homes here, running from places like Barcelona and Madrid in hopes of avoiding the virus. As there is no screening it’s possible they are bringing the virus with them. This is one of the reasons the government here are pleading with central government to be allowed to halt travel except for food and other necessities."

"Thanks all. Day 3 of the restrictions and we count ourselves fortunate that we have enough space to walk around the perimeter of our plot for a couple of 30minute spells every day. Our thoughts are for the families in the blocks of flats in the towns with the kids home from school and only a small balcony. That really is hard. The news this morning is that there are another 1,200 new cases since midnight and 149 deaths. Madrid and Barcelona are faring the worst. No figures yet for the islands. Take care everyone and stay well."
"New travel restrictions between the islands and with the mainland. “ Commercial flights to the Balearic Islands are prohibited with few exceptions. This is the main measure that the President of the Government, Francina Armengol, is currently announcing in terms of the connectivity of the Community. Armengol has indicated that the Ministry of Transport is working with the airlines to specify which would be the flights that are established in these minimum services.In any case, she explained that from Palma, the maximum will be a daily flight with Madrid, Barcelon, Valencia, Menorca and Ibiza.In the case of Menorca, only one daily flight with Barcelona, ​​Madrid and Palma is allowed. Regarding sea routes, they cannot transport passengers, only goods.”We have another 19 cases across the islands today, but we are still waiting for details of where."
"Two new cases on Menorca, 8 on Ibiza and 9 on Mallorca."
Its getting really frightening and that's the British Government banning all non essentail travel worldwide. If you take a look at the website Flight Radar24 which shows actual fights in the air in real time it seems amazing they will get this under control. (if you click on any plane it gives flight details. It also makes you realise how easy it must be to pass this virus around the world.
"Hi Qualityspy, I think the problem is there are so many untruths being branded about too. I've made the decision today and cancelled by trip over in July. Hubby is self employed so we need to bear that in mind too. He's already lost of couple of jobs this week. He's a trademsan and people dont want to take any risks. At this time I have only lost my deposit, and will rebook when all this is over. Take care."
"After much discussion my wife & I also decided to cancel our planned holiday to Es Casell this coming June/ July .We cant see the situation getting much better before then , just feel so sorry for everyone in Menorca which depends so much on the tourist season .We do have another booking which is for September at the moment we have no plans to cancel but that may change nearer to when Jet2 take full payment & of course this dammed virus .Stay safe people and here's to better times"
I had a text from Love Holidays a few days ago about my 2 June booking (a flights and accom package paid for already) which was an update saying to visit the website rather than call them unless you are within 7 days of departure etc etc . I am currently taking the view that if we cancel the trip ourselves at this stage money is lost anyway (the flights are nonrefundable ones) whereas if we wait and see we may just find that the whole package will be cancelled . Luckily it was not an expensive booking in the first place
"MRMethinks we will all be in lock down until the end of summer so I would wait and let Loveholidays cancel and then you will get a refund.I am sure my trip/flights to Tossa in June will be off,SS"
"There are a further 20 cases across the islands this morning, but no details of where until later today. Will post further details later. Under the restrictions, except in special circumstances, only one person is allowed to be in a car on the road, and then only for a permitted journey. Ditto entry to supermarkets. Spain has not forgotten its military past and sure does know how make sure this is obeyed.Edited: 7:21 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Final news for todayThe Balearic Islands have 112 cases of coronavirus and have already accumulated two fatalities , as announced by the Ministry of Health on Wednesday. This is 20 more positive cases than this Tuesday . Of them there are 53 admitted, of which five are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). There are also 14 Balearic health workers affected. By islands, at 9 in Menorca, we must add 10 in Eivissa and 93 in Mallorca.The article in the paper goes on to say:It should be noted that these cases are diagnosed, so considering that the analyzes are only performed in severe cases, the number of infected by the virus is possibly many more ."
"Today’s update copied from the daily paper. By islands, at 11 in Menorca, we must add 19 in Eivissa and 139 in Mallorca. People here are expecting the numbers to increase markedly when the new testing is rolled out next week.Hope everyone who reads this stays safe and well wherever you are. Cheers, Ruth."
Thanks qualityspy1 Same to you. We are currently in isolation waiting to find out if we need tested. All getting very real now! This time last year all we were concerned about was how much sun cream to pack!
"Self isolating is getting widerspread where I am too sam h - I live on the outskirts of Greater London and my spanish tutor has just cancelled our weekly class ( held in her home) because one of her other students who came to her home on Monday has just phoned to tell her that he was in a pub last Friday with a friend who has just come down with it and is in hospital! She is self isolating but anxious not to lose the income so is trying to sort out Facetime or Skype sessions for a week or two but one of my fellow student is in her mid 70s and doesn't ""do"" computers"" much if she can avoid it so I am not sure if that is going to work! Stay safe everybody. My especial thoughts go out to QualitySpy1 who is lockdown in Son Bou slowly climbing the walls of her villa in a deserted resort ! Hitting it hard seems to be working in Menorca at least if most of the new infections are in Mallorca - I wonder how many tourists travelling back from Palma on the last flights home from there have inadvertently carried it back with themEdited: 10:47 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Hi Sam, I am really hoping you and your family will be okay. It is a really worrying time for you.I am feeling okay about being confined to the house for a period of time. We have a routine of cleaning, gardening, exercise, language practice, reading, etc etc. Menorca is just not testing or diagnosing cases until it becomes an emergency situation, so we have no faith at all in the figures. Really when you look at the size of our population compared to Mallorca, the contagion rates are not dissimilar. We will hope for the best as things have a long way to go yet. x. Ruth"
So sorry to hear that sam h. Very stressful for you all. Keep safe.x
"Thank you, we have only been in since Friday past but now told as my sons showing symptoms Since yesterday that’s us back to 14days again. He is doing good a nasty cough though and is asthmatic unfortunately can’t been seen unless he has a raging temperature which he doesn’t and hopefully won’t. guess we’re all going to have to get used to it now. Qualityspy1 I’m sure you’ve got a lovely terrace to sit out in, unfortunately my view is the garden shed! Suppose I could always give it a coat of paint lolEdited: 3:22 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Fingers crossed for you son that he doesnt have it, stay safe x"
"Better news. Only one new case here today and less across the islands as a whole. The figures for all cases (not new ones) are: Menorca 12, Ibiza 20, Mallorca 171. But the bigger picture across Spain is depressing. I am getting a bit down, so have decided I’ll start writing a personal journal, to kind of air my feelings and fears. I remembered that I did this while I was training as a therapist and it helped. Our next door neighbours on one side of us arrived last Saturday on the final flight in from London. They have been blissfully unaware of the need to self isolate for two weeks after arrival or of any of the restrictions in force. So yesterday they went shopping in two supermarkets in Mahon! Just great! Stay safe and well everyone and look forward to better times."
Really ? Where have they been when all of this has been unfolding?Unless they have had no access to newspapers TV or other media for weeks they must have heard that Spain was in total lockdown
"Unfortunately it can be an age thing , after watching comments of some older folks , father in law took some convincing , daughter was threatened with taking bus pass away, hubby after losing temper threatened to take wheelchair !!! Finally us , social worker and enabler got through to her . Stress I don’t need , stay safe all"
"Hi peeps. 43 new cases across the islands today. 3 here on Menorca, 1 on Ibiza, remainder on Mallorca. My next door neighbours who arrived via the last flight from Gatwick last Saturday, decided to ignore the decree and went shopping today. From the other side of the road as they were unloading they told me all was fine as there were very few cases here and they were feeling fine. Lost it and told them that they could have just spread it to umpteen people in the supermarket today and they were being totally irresponsible! Didn’t get on well in the first place, so no loss! Gilipollas!"
"So even with a print out they still didnt get it. Isn't there a number you can report people who aren't obeying the rules.The police arrested someone for using a hotel pool the other day, 1000euro fine."
Report them Ruth - just because they are old they cannot flout rules meant to protect everybody else
Agree with MR Majorca are taking prisoners ! How stupidHope they done everything need your help . Keep safe
"Sorry Hope they don’t need your helpEdited: 3:51 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Selfish,Stupid People,you are right to be so Angry ,there ignorance is totally unacceptable report them I hope they get a massive fine or worse it will serve them right."
"It amazes me how people dont seem to think this is serious. Reports yesterday of people flocking to the sesside because the sun came out. Its costing lives, trillions of money and people their jobs. It really shows how self absorbed a lot of the world has become. Anyway rant over, hope your all staying fit. I have accepted we wont be on menorca at the start of june, but there is always next year. People a lot worse off.Edited: 4:52 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Good afternoon from a grey and drizzly Menorca. Before the sun disappeared this morning, I took some pics of the flowers in our garden to cheer myself up and have posted them on my profile on the photos tab. At least it reminds everyone that there is still good stuff out there! Now the depressing stuff. The emergency restrictions have been extended until 12 April.There are another 3000 cases across the country this morning and the Ministry of Health has verified there are 331 people infected with coronavirus across the islands which represents an increase of 34.5% compared to the figures of this Saturday, when the official number of patients with COVID-19 was 246.Going to be tough being confined for so much longer, but understandable. Stay safe and well!"
"The sun has appeared again today, after torrential rain last evening.Figures for the islands as of midday today are: 23 in Menorca, 33 in Ibixa/Eivissa and 344 in Mallorca .Stay safe and well everyone. cheers, Ruth"
thank you for your post.. I will be watching closely as we are due to fly to menorca in september.
It is reported today that Jet2 have notified hotels they will commence the season on 17th June if permitted. Tui however have given their date as 1st July. It is not discounted though that the complete season may be lost to international visitors. I am booked for September but am not holding my breath in these uncertain times.
"I am booked (with EasyJet) for May, May/June, July, August/September and October.. Taking no bets but fingers crossed for at least one !!"
No fiesta any time soon then!
"Hello, I was just wondering if there was any word on when hotels would be likely to re open for the season, if at all? I'm booked to come on the 3rd July, still holding out hope for a nice holiday. Thank you for you're updates on the situation."
Ruth - I saw something on the news this morning about Spain possibly easing the very rigid restrictions that I know you and other residents are living under at present just a little - is there any word on that on the island yet?Felices Pascuas a todos!
"Hi guys. No, the only relaxation is allowing workers in non-essential jobs to return to work (construction, manufacturing) from today. These were people who were stopped from working two weeks ago as an additional measure and have to make up the hours missed. Nothing else will change until April 26 and then we are not too hopeful."
"Good news! Three consecutive days with no new cases on Menorca! Not so good news, the European Commission’s road map for opening borders etc.A very long road ahead if it is to be believed and for economies like ours on Menorca, awful. Stay safe and well. Cheers, Ruth.Edited: 10:47 am, April 15, 2020 "
Link to EU plan for lifting restrictions.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…
It is going to take a long time to sort this problem that is for sure . I still don't expect our trip in early June is going to happen :-(
Sorry to hear that - I had really been looking forward to seeing you both again. Keep as cheerful as you can and look forward to restrictions being eased soon XXXX
"We are supposed to be coming to stay in a villa in Punta Prima on 1st May. Villa company says the villa is still available!!!! We want to know if there are villa cleaners and pool cleaners working. Also will,there be shops open in Punta Prima for us to buy all we need to self cater for 2 weeks. We thought that Menorca was closed down. Help pleaseRose"
"Hi Rose. No, you will not be able to come because the Emergency/state of alarm will be continuing for another 15 days once this one expires on 26 April. That means there is still total lockdown and no flights from the UK will be allowed to land at Mahon airport. There are flights from Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca but to be allowed to take these you must either be a resident of Menorca returning to your home or permitted personnel like medical staff. To be honest it would be pointless coming here as you are not allowed outside your residence, except to buy food or pharmaceuticals (that means you cannot go to the beach). Other contributors might be able to advise you on the legal situation regarding the villa. I’m sorry you will lose your holiday."
Thank you for that info. Much appreciated Could anyone else let us know if the villa staff will be working. Thanks Rose
"Hi again. When you say villa staff, I see pool guys and gardeners out and about as normal. But as no tourists can come here from anywhere, including mainland Spain, no cleaners. Who have you rented with and do you have travel insurance?"
"Rose, to add to my reply. No there are no shops open in Punta Prima or restaurants, or bars, or in any other urbanisation. The big supermarkets in Mahon and Ciutadella and other residential towns are open for locals to buy the essentials we need. There are severe penalties for breaking the lockdown, including arrest and it is being enforced rigidly by the policía and guardia civil. However, as you cannot get here by air or the ferries I guess it is immaterial really. Sorry."
"I’d be interested to know how you would be travelling Rosemarie , as all charter flights are cancelled , I’m with Jet 2 and have had 12/5 and 12/6 holiday and flights cancelled , I would hope your airline has been in touch. I would also hope you paid on CC for your villa . Find it unbelievable that the villa company expects you to still be coming to the island at this time ."
"Surely the villa company know this to be the case and that letting the place out to you as a tourist would not be acceptable . As QualitySpy1 says , the lockdown is being rigorously enforced in Menorca and nobody is allowed out of their homes for essential shopping and medical appointments etc - even walking in the street for exercise is not permitted You mention the villa company - which one is it precisely - can you give us a link to its website ? Are you sure it isn't one of the scam businesses mentioned in the thread at the top of the forum because it sounds very suspicious to me that anybody reputable is claiming that the villa is available for you to use a couple of weeks knowing the lockdown is being so heavily enforced. I hate to think that you have been scammed but …..."

"Just to add to my previous post, IF it is not an outright scam in that the villa DOES exist but the ""villa company "" isn't 100% what it seems in that it is letting out villas that do NOT have valid touristic licenses you are still in a pickleYou should definitely have been given details of the property's touristic license when you booked it , and if it doesn't have one then it probably is an illegal let and the owner should not be renting it anyway regardless of the lockdown . If the villa company/owner cannot supply the touristic license number and/or will not return your money in full on the basis that the property is NOT available for you to use then I suggest that you report them to the Menorcan authorities for trying to let tourist accom to non residents during the lockdown ,and possibly also (if relevant) for letting out an unlicensed property commercially as there are huge fines for letting out unlicensed accom to tourists in normal times - the fine for an owner who lets accommodation without the correct touristic license is way more than you will have paid them for two weeks in early MayTBH my worry is that the villa may not exist at all or at least may not be available via the person you are renting it from. Please look at the pinned thread about dodgy villa rentals at the top of the main Menorca forum page. One way that you can check if the property exists is to find its address on the Google map https://www.google.com/maps/@39.8134672,4.2774868,17.47zs and do a street view virtual walk past it . I really hope that things are not what I fear but things seem VERY odd at the moment . I hope that you paid by credit card Good luck !IEdited: 1:03 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"It isn’t so much that the property exists, but that it is actually available for rent. One of the worst scams we have seen, was a real villa that was up for sale with several estate agents on the island. The scammers lifted the estate agents’ photos and created their own website and advertising blurb. The real owner was oblivious to the scam.As requested, could you please name the villa rental company involved. If they are a genuine local company I’m sure their name will be mud after this and will feature in an ‘avoid at all costs’ alert."
"Sorry for not responding to Any more mail yesterday but our server went down and we had no mail.We have booked with a company and know that there are no flights but they have told other customers who booked villas only that they are still available and so aren’t giving refunds. I feel more armed now when Speak to them. Thank you all so much for your help.RoseEdited: 2:06 am, April 20, 2020 "
That’s great. Thank you
"I would still want to know which villa company it is - it might help owners snd potential customers know what sort of outfit they are dealing with - it is shocking to be resisting refunds when they know that the tourist season will not start until after May I understand that you do not want to put your refund at risk yet, but please tell us their name when you have resolved the issue!Edited: 6:52 am, April 20, 2020 "
Thanks for understanding that. I will let you know as soon as I can.Rose
Great - please do and good luck!
"Some sunlight in the dark clouds, cleanly presented (for a change )Status of ""known"" covid-19 on Menorca. Care homes I feel will dominate sadly many clusters of caseshttps://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/lo…Edited: 1:53 am, April 24, 2020 "
Just to make clear - comment about clear presentation was reference to media reporting nothing else
Thanks for the link Jenny. I am happy to know that the island's efforts at trying to put the lid on the spread are proving to be worth the pain.
I was chatting with a friend yesterday who is a local from Ciutadella and who works in the hospitality industry and he said that most businesses have written off this season.He also referred me to this article that says the British may be banned from the Balearics this summer due to the tardy way we dealt with going into lockdown.https://www.travelmole.com/news_feature.php…
"I am not surprised Tim . The islanders have been in lockdown for several weeks unable to pretty much anything and they see reports of the British ignoring all the ""advice"" and wandering out and about in the sunshine with our infection rates and death toll being what it is thinking ""what levels of new infections will we get if we let them back in too soon? "" I think faced with economic problems and large numbers of tourist spreading Covid19 contact across the island they will prefer to risk the loss of income and can you blame them ?Edited: 11:33 am, April 24, 2020 "
"Just wanted to pop in this thread to give a big thanks to the OP, and everyone else, for the updates. I was due to have a fortnight from June 14th so have been reading the forum regularly for the past few weeks for ongoing news, and while I'm not at 100% acceptance my holiday isn't going to happen (I'm only at about 95% acceptance lol) it's been a huge help everyone posting info. I'm sure I'm not the only one reading but not posting, so again, huge thanks to everyone here for far more info than I could have hoped for :-)"
"One thing the ""low"" numbers and minimal entrance possibilities to Menorca offers is the chance to identify who ,where and how the Virus spread? It would possibly be very revealing."
"The nearest I can come to the ‘where did they contact it?’ question in recent weeks, is from reports in the paper each day. All the handful of new cases that have occurred have been either health staff who had been in contact with hospitalised patients (8 staff are still quarantined and under observation, but not tested positive) or linked to the cases in the geriatric unit in Es Mercadal and the one in Cituadella. As Jenny says, because we are such a small island it allows contact tracing to be done quite easily. That will obviously change once the island opens up to visitors again."
I think those with the data probably already have this analysis - as always publication or wider distribution is another matter.QS I was thinking more about the start.Logic says it came in from outside And from whom might even be known (not that names should be given )
Hi Jenny. Patient zero is known and was an older person on the Imserso programme. Staying in a Ciutadella hotel and had come with a group from Madrid.
Wasn't there another patient zero the doctor who came back from Mallorca?
"I remember a Diari ref to an Immerso Tourist., and I more vaguely the Doctor. Also worry about mainland second home owners coming in from metropoles?"
I heard the version that Ruth mentions in Post 100 too. That the first known case was a male Imserso Scheme tourist from Madrid who was staying in Ciutadella and became ill during his holidayThe case of the infected doctor arriving and taking the infection into the state hospital in Mahon through careless behaviour was slightly later in the outbreak if I remember correctly but I don't read the local papers daily so that may be complete hogwash!
"Hi booked a villa for the beginning of May with 'reputable' online company (used them 5 times before no probs)They contacted me to ask if I wished to cancel (20th April ) I replied I would like a refund. They replied (4th may) again trying to get me to cancel, again I stated due to Spain's lock down rules it would not be allowed to use the accomdation as a UK tourist...today they replied by essentially avoiding answering and again trying to pursuade me to cancel! So they can 'negotiate with the villa company to get me the best possible outcome' as the travel company themselves have non cancellable in their small print...I have today stated it is my belief that they or the villa company are actually cancelling therefore I am entitled to a refund and I asked for confirmation that the villas are open to UK visitors..no reply so far..I have until the 8th to cancel.Can anyone tell me how I stand with my credit card co if I ask to cancel and they offer me less/vouchers etc will this make any claim on my card void and can I claim on the card after the start date of my holiday?Sorry it's a bit long but details matterRegards"
"I honestly don't know all the ins and outs of this and would strongly advise you to talk to someone in the uk giving travel cancellation advice and also talk to your credit card company. Above all, don’t cancel yourself. They need to cancel your accommodation as it would break the terms of the state of alarm as it stands until 9 May. (The state of alarm may be extended tomorrow)."
"@vinny-cent this perhaps not the best forum as you need better legal advice based on the wording of your TCs you accepted. Which country law applies in the event of dispute? - should say in TCS. Larger villa companies may often buy (via contract) guaranteed no. Of weeks for named period fixed prices in advance from private villas owners so have this contracted payment exposure.Wish you the bestEdited: 1:27 am, May 06, 2020 "
Thanks for the replies guys! I really wanted people to know the travel company I am with are using an approach which is designed to make 'me' cancel rather than them! And being evasive when asked direct questions.I thought others who because of the covid situation thought the travel companies were trustworthy should think carefully before they agree to cancel!The secondary question about the refund and credit card was just because I know you guys are most knowledgeable on so many aspects of travel and I thought you may know more than me at this point.One final question can anyone tell me if the Binibeca beach apts the white fisherman's cottage complex of villas will be open from 14th May?..it looks a nice place to stay ;)Thanks again for your time replyingRegards
Hi. Nothing is going to be open to tourists in May full stop. Sorry.
"Hi,I posted this on another query but essentially your question should be answered here. In law the contract is ""frustrated"" i.e. impossible to carry out.I would contact your credit card company who will ultimately be responsible to refund you and ask them to deal with it. https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/0…"
"@ vinney-cent . Have a look at Posts 74 onwards regarding a similar ""problem"" with a villa rental that Rosemarie G was having - I wonder if it is the same company - you may find it useful to liaise with her via private messaging !"
Thanks guys!
"New announcement from the Spanish government this morning.Travelers who come to Spain from abroad must keep a 14-day quarantine for the coronavirus , according to an order of the Ministry of Health published in the Official State Gazette ( BOE in pdf), which will be effective from Friday, 15 May, and will be in force during the alarm state and its possible extensions.Bear in mind that the state of alarm may not be renewed at the end of thIs month."
Flights still in place for 2nd October ! Haha will keep them back if store cupboard ☕️
"We are hoping to come in October too ,is it worth booking flights at the moment or wait just worried that if there is any they may have gone?the hotel is pay on arrival so that's ok ,not sure what to do ,any advice would be greatly received thank you :-)"
"Austria now offers a COVID-19 test on arrival for $200. if you test negative, you don't have to quarantine. The visitor pays the cost and Austria gets the tourist dollars. If other countries follow suit, our vacations could be saved."
"Thanks for reply QS,the flights are with Ryanair ,so if I book and we are not allowed to visit for obvious reasons we should be able to use them in 2021 or get a refund ,I might take the plunge and book them tomorrow thanks again x"
"Cheers Karen. Just be sure you are okay with Ryanair, their customer service is not the best."
FYI Austria Airport testing was stated by official to be not a tourist focused purpose and only viable in terms of capacity with very reduced passenger numbers. an electronic virus free passport seems to be a more realistic way for passenger screening in the future?@Karen personally I would wait before buying any tickets for October this year
"Thanks for advice ,I'm going to wait to see how things go thanks again everyone ."
"Will it be possible to travel there on august with no restrictions, quarantine, etc? I really wanna go but I don’t wanna go if I have to be stranded there for 14 days on quarentine, or if I eventually go there and can’t even enjoy the beaches properly due to the restrictions. Hope someone can get back to me, with really appreciate it."
"Carlos no one can answer that , I think you just have to wait and see what happens . Keep checking ,Not sure where your from , but in the UK the tour ops are refundingHolidays and flights I’m cancelled 12th June flights and should be in menorca now , instead , I’m waiting for refund"
"Hi Carlos. Are you perhaps living in España? If so you will likely be able to travel here providing your region has reached level 3. But... yes, all beaches will have some sort of restrictions to avoid overcrowding. No agreed measures yet. Maybe a first come entry system or something else. At the moment nothing is clear."
"I’m from Portugal, thank you guys for answering. I will try to keep up with updates."
"Carlos , keep checking on here , QS is on the island and keeps us all up to date with developments.Keep safe"
"Balearic airports will be able to receive tourists from the EU at the end of JuneDependent on situation in Stage 3, Has anyone any further updates on this my translation is not so good! Its reported on Menorca.info"
"@samh what are you asking? Flying from UK or ?Personally recommend have a look at El Pais ( also english version ) online over menorca.info for more details about this kind of stuffEdited: 11:47 am, May 15, 2020 "
"As QS says these articles in dailyBS and menorca.info are often (mostly :-( ) ideas been run up a flag pole. Also ahat might be possible in Majorca might well be a non starter in Menorca as hoteliers etc have less appetite etc etcEdited: 11:53 am, May 15, 2020 "
Latest from the minister of the central gov in Madrid.https://apple.news/AsdTv7KBXSeGuuBNTS32qDQ
Not looking good for this year at all. EasyJet is now no longer offering flights to the island until July but my bet is that they will still not be flying into Mahon after that either - it must be concerning for those Brits with private holiday homes there which have been locked up for months and months.
"Thanks everyone, I’m not expecting things to pick up till next year, had came across this earlier on a fb group so posted here for further understanding of What this actually meant. Cheers"
Thanks Tom I’ll keep a note of El Pais for future!
I am glad that you are being cautious Ruth - you do not want either of you to become sick because others are too silly to follow the rules
I doubt that is likely to translate into British tourists being welcome again any time soon - we are still recording 400 -500 deaths a day at the moment !
Open for International travel and who is allowed to travel is not necessarily about tourism ...at this stage
"On a purely selfish note that is good for me as I am about a week away from my EasyJet flight on 2 June being officially ""cancelled"" by the airline (they aren't selling tickets for it anymore but seem to only officially cancel 7 days ahead) which will then start us on the long road of getting a refund . I wouldn't want to go now when things as so very far from ""normal"" but it is hard to accept that we will not be driving around the island chilling at our favourite places any time soon"
"MR sitting here on a wet morning , thinking what I would have been doing in S’algar today ! Sun , sea lots of drinks and good food !!!"

That’s the one! We are Keeping our eye on the situation. Attempting to come early July all going well. Had written off our chances but that announcement has left the slightest glimmer of hope. Need closure!Thanks.
A little bit of good news about airports. As of yet not for package holidays but at least things are moving in the right direction. Let's hope it continues to improve.https:/…
"Yes a very small glimmer of hope. My concern is whilst spain may say we can go, the uk plan to have us all in quarintine on our return for 2 weeks. Quite how they police it is another debate, but I for one cant afford to take 4 weeks off work.Cancelled our villa for june 6th and have already recieved deposit back, awaiting easyjet to cancel flight before asking for a refund. Would love to get over this summer at some point"
"We were supposed to arrive there yesterday morning, we have deferred til next May now. Hoping, with everything crossed that we may be able to be there for our October one. Its good to read on here all your postsEdited: 11:33 am, May 19, 2020 "
Hi-we’re planning (fingers crossed) to travel to the island in Aug. Have just received an email from Car Hire company (Alamo) that they have canx the car as they will not be available under the current crisis. Seems a bit premature....any had the sam experience and does anyone now of an alternative hire company who won’t let us down?
"It may be good news that Alamo have cancelled. Whether your holiday is likely to go ahead depends on where you will be travelling from. At the moment a German tour operator is expecting to restart in the Balearics in 3 weeks time. If you are able to go the recommended car hire companies are the local ones such as Rentacarsalgar.com , Doncars, Sol, AutosVictoria Who are all reliable."
"Thanks for the update. We’re travelling from the Uk and are crossing fingers that in 8 weeks time things will look promising. Thanks for the recommendations, once I receive the refund from Alamo I’ll be sure to look them up."
Booking with the local car hires Dettorifan has mentioned you pay nothing at all till you pick the car up
"I have now had the expected email from Love Holidays telling me that my package holiday ""cannot go ahead as originally planned"". It offers three options :- 1) An ABTA protected refund credit voucher valid until 31 March 2020 for the value of the accommodation element of my booking plus a gift of £25 for agreeing to take the voucher - the implication is that the flights will be dealt with separately 2) Reschedule the booking to another date3) Request a refund Currently the 2 June flight is shown on EJ’s website as ""sold out"" rather than cancelled (is a subtle but potentially important difference) and the EJ manage my booking page is still offering me the option to check in for it even though I know it is not going to fly as there are no EJ flights available for booking until the beginning of July I have opted for the refund as we have no intention of booking any overseas trips until the Covid19 issues are much clearer than at the moment. To me £25 is not enough of an incentive for me to not ask for my money back even if it takes some time to come through. The EJ website has acknowledged my request for a refund but has said that as refunds are taking time they have issued me with the ABTA refund credit “just in case “ I change my mine whilst waiting! On 2 June I am going to feel very sad - I should have been in Menorca by midmorning that day and making the difficult choice of deciding where to drive for lunch -instead we will have to have lunch in the garden but it cannot be helped and I will make some large pomadas using our fast dwindling stock of Mahon Gin to toast distant friends and happier times to come"
"You’ve made the right decision everything’s still too much in the air to be planning at the moment, I would go back to them though about them issuing you with the credit refund incase their pulling a fly one. At least put it on an email to them that this was not at your request.We were due to travel on the 10th June and have exactly the same plan just been online trying to source some gin! We can always dream!"
"I have looked at that carefully sam h(your comments in Post 157) because I also thought it looked potentially iffy, but I have screen-prints of all stages of my ""refund not voucher please"" instructions so I can prove that I asked for the refund not a voucher plus the message I had acknowledging it definitely acknowledges that I am after a refund and effectively says that the voucher is a ""just in case you change your mind"" sort of thing. The following is a direct copy and paste (edited to leave out some of the waffle) of the relevant text on the acknowledgement screen ;- "" Request submittedThank you for telling us that you would like a refund. Here’s what will happen next:1. We have immediately stopped any future payments from being taken in respect of your original booking2. We will be in touch with you by email to advise you of next steps regarding your refund...…..we are processing refund requests in departure date order. We will aim to be in contact with you by email within 30 days...…..the refunds themselves may take time but we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure these refunds happen on your behalf.3. In the meantime, we are providing you with a Refund Credit Note. Knowing that cash refunds may take time, we want you to retain the option to amend your booking to go on a new trip instead. You can use the Refund Credit Note Code on this page to make a new booking on our website if you like. We have also included a small goodwill gesture of £25 which is redeemable if you do rebook with us instead of getting a cash refund. This goodwill amount is included in your Refund Credit Note Code value but it isn’t part of your Refund Credit Note itself, and you can’t exchange it for cash if you don't use it - but we hope it helps. You will need to use it to make a new booking before the Refund Credit Note expires (but you will be able to travel at a later date)..We will put all of your Refund Credit Note documentation in Manage My Booking, including details on how you can use it, and the terms and conditions which apply. These terms and conditions are also available here...."" .@ QS1 I will have to make two - one with lemon and one with cucumber! What great news about your local infection rate - it helps everyone feel that their diligence (enforced or not) has been worthwhile """
MR I would happy enough with that looks fair enough!
I will hold you to that !
"Hello friends. Just saw the news from the Spanish government, and from what I understood they are welcoming tourists and telling people too book their vacations in Spain."
Remember current rules 14 days quarantine on return to UK or £1000 fine.
"But Spain is lifting its own quarantine on 1st July. Source rtve.es.“The 14-day quarantine imposed on all travelers arriving from abroad will end on July 1, as confirmed by government sources to TVE. The decision was made at an Inter-ministerial meeting held this Monday by videoconference in which the Vice-Presidents Teresa Ribera and Nadia Calviño and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Arancha González Laya, participated.”"
That's correct but until the UK government relaxes its rules on returning holidaymakers we will have to self isolate on our return to UK.
"Hi QS, what are the daily numbers at the moment on the island? I saw on a previous post it was 16 days or so with the all clear which is fantastic for the island. Stay safe."
What was the total death toll to date Ruth? I seem to remember someone posting somewhere that most were from a nursing home environment
"Hi MR, I think it is 13 on Menorca in total."
Very sad for everyone concerned . I hope that the 3 still in ICU that you mentioned recover fully in the end
"""Me alegro mucho, siento un enorme ORGULLO de los menorquines, de mis paisanos, tanto ellos como ellas. Hemos hecho los deberes, a pesar de que ha sido difícil hemos doblegado la enfermedad, pintamos una raya en el suelo y de ahí no pasó. Nos merecemos ir con la cabeza bien alta y disfrutar estos días de paz mientras reaparece el turismo. Es un triunfo de la ciudadanía en la que se incluye todo el mundo, desde el mecánico a la médico. Mi más sincera enhorabuena a todos.""A nice comment from Diario online :-)Edited: 8:21 am, May 26, 2020 "
That is a lovely sentiment! It cannot have been easy to cope with the level of lockdown enforced upon everyone on the island
"Hey. So does anyone have any wisdom yet on whether hotels in Menorca will be open in August? It all seems a bit confusing... Tui want our balance now. Do we know if there are restrictions on things like swimming pools & water parks? This will impact us greatly with the kids if we can't use the pool...Edited: 10:29 am, May 29, 2020 "
"IMPORTANT.News just published after the prime minister's announcement today.""The quarantine for international tourists will conclude in the Balearic Islands on June 21, coinciding with the end of the state of alarm , after Pedro Sánchez has announced that he will request a new extension, the last before starting the new normal. The President of the Government, Francina Armengol, has announced that the President of the Government has given the go-ahead that tourists arriving from other countries do not have to meet quarantine from that date and may have the same mobility conditions as the rest of citizens.""So, things are moving faster than we expected. Providing you have confirmed flights, the start of July is looking a much better bet than it did yesterday."
QSForgive me for being thicker than normal.After June 21 will Spain accept tourists from ALL countries or just those with low virus rates?Thank you
"Now that is the 64,000$ question."
Thank you QSI have never got that far on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire so I will await any further info
Latest news 8 hours ago here is that Brits are at the back of the queue.
"I read that in the UK press too. It appears to relate to a pilot scheme starting on 22June to bring in tourists from selected EU countries. From 1 July Spain has declared that it is open for international tourism. I am struggling to find the original source for the story in Spanish to see how the original version was worded. There is some controversy over press statements yesterday which referred to the EU area and then to the Schengen area, which were contradictory. The articles correctly said that the UK was in the EU during the transition period, but forgot it is not part of schengen. At the moment nothing is certain, but unless things worsen in the UK, I cannot see Spain excluding U.K. citizens from 1 July."
"This is from an interview the Spanish Tourism Minister gave to a Spanish radio station : As for the countries where these first tourists will come from, Maroto has detailed that the Government is talking to ""quite a few markets"", among which he has highlighted Germany (the second largest tourist source market to Spain) and the Nordic countries, which ""right now they are in a very good (epidemiological) situation.""""It is very important that the first tourists are tourists who are in the same epidemiological situation as us,"" he explained, and that ""they are also in a position to be able to fly safely.""Regarding the United Kingdom (the first issuer), Maroto pointed out that, although there have been talks with tour operators such as TUI and Jet2holidays, there ""the data still has to improve"", since ""for us it is important to ensure that the person comes in handy and then come back well. ""In fact, the British authorities themselves still do not recommend traveling abroad, so British tour operators do not want to operate at the moment, according to the minister. Full article in Spanish here https://www.diaridetarragona.com/noticias/Es…Edited: 1:43 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"Thank you for posting this which also appeared in the Balearic daily papers. The important thing is that the interview relates to a pilot program to bring in tourists in the last two weeks of June. “ The Government is working on safe corridor projects so that in the second half of June some autonomous communities, currently Balearic and Canary Islands, can receive foreign tourists, possibly German and Nordic , as a previous step to open, from July 1, the borders to international tourism.” The UK is not being considered for this pilot unless the data on infections improves. Hope that helps to clarify the situation."
Will be be ok for October flights?unsure whether to book them or not .
"Thanks ruth for reply ,might be worth us holding of till after July to see how things go before I book then."
"Re the pilot program, which I thinks was mostly for Mallorca,my current understanding is the mainland health minister has the final approval and it is still pending as it has been for quite some time....ie who would have booked anyway?Hotels are being ""blocked"" from re-opening as the social security program funds that the government provided in the state of emergency are having the unintented consequence of making it less viable financially to reopen in a minimal way without all employees loosing out - as the conditions for government funds would be broken. I know a couple of friends on Menorca who work in hotels who confirm their return to work is totally confused"
"Think the pilot scheme is a good idea but they should just be allowing internal travel 1st.I have read comments from locals and they are complaining about allowing international travel. I know its hard, I live in a high tourist area with a low rate of infection. We dont want visitors that could bring something extra but also need bars etc to open. Several large hotels have already gone under. However, with limited capacity in restuarants I think some places may feel there is not much point opening if they are only going to breakeven at best.Edited: 3:46 am, June 01, 2020 "
"Ive got flights and villa booked via James Holidays for mid-August. Soon they want the balance - I have only paid a small deposit so far and am not keen on handing over the rest for something that seems 50/50 at the moment. What makes it worse if that, if I cancel now, I would be liable for 40% of the holiday cost. That's a lot more than deposit paid. That late cancellation penalty would be reasonable in normal times, it doesn't feel so now.If I could roll the booking into 2021, I would."
"I think more on the UK end - Government seems to be actively playing down the chance of people getting away this summer. Maybe they want us to holiday in UK and spend our money here.And this quarantine on return to UK is a worry. It is obviously a wrong step (IMO) but the Government seem very keen on it. But I do agree that, if we get there, it may be quieter than normal!"
It is a very very hard balance between protection and economics :-( ...it is not like many of the bars and restaurants have recent years of massive surplus profits in the bank
@qualityspy1. Is it possible to view a list of the locations/districts in Spain and the locations of the new infections?Having 25 days free from new infections is impressive.
"Yes, by autonomous community.https:/…Actualizacion_126_COVID-19.pdfThese bulletins are published every day my the ministry for health.To get them, use the Worldometer website. Then in the daily table, click on Spain. That opens a new data set and about half way down the page you see a link to this source data. Click on the word ‘source’ and up comes today’s detailed figures."
I have made reservations for the last week of July.I'm positive things will be better by then.
Thanks qualityspy1. Ryanair flights less than €20 from Dublin. Very tempting. The only negative is that they are evening flights.
Hi BOXtheFOXThat is a bargain. We were due to fly Saturday 20th June and we paid €340 return for 2 people.If I could travel in July I would unfortunately we are tied to June dates for this year.
"I am having trouble locating the Menorcan stats Ruth. I am struggling to find where on the Spain page I can hone down the info enough to get to Menorca - I can find the Baleares totals but nothing more precise. How do you get to them ? I have been using the Worldometers info page daily to look at worldwide stats for several weeks as it is very good . I particularly like the fact that you can flip between today , yesterday and 2 days previous to make comparisons but have never drilled down as far into the figures as you seem to be able to do. BTW, talking of daily stats have you noticed that when looking at country by country stats most nations only post their figures once a day whereas the USA starts off posting with impossibly low figures which then continuingly rise and rise over the day - it is really irritating, in fact these days I just wait until the next morning and select the ""yesterday"" figures for the USA to get their true daily death figure As the UK has already exceeded the number of deaths per million of population rates of both Spain & Italy, then bearing in mind that the UK is a good couple of weeks behind them, I really cannot see what incentive Spain would have to welcome Brits into its territories with open arms at the moment especially as the UK ""R"" rate has started going back up again here since the lockdown rules were eased a few days ago . The most recent evidence online says that the UK Rate has increased. It is now 1.01 in the North West of England, exactly 1 in the South West and 0.9 in the Midlands according to data produced by Public Health England and who knows where it will be in another couple of weeks if people are allowed to continue to relax as much as they seem to be doing this past week or so The unfortunate truth seems to be that the UK went into a serious lockdown a couple of weeks too late and is now trying to lift it sooner than we ought to. It is going to be a whole lot more difficult to wind backwards and reimpose stricter rules once the genie is out of the box again"
"Please send me a picture Ruth!! Does your beloved have a ""manly patterned one"" or is he sticking to the standard paper type ones ? I have made fitted masks from a YouTube video for the whole family but my son and his girlfriend are very resistant to the idea of wearing them in public if others are masklessEdited: 2:37 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"I would love to visit Menorca and have been researching possible locations and places to stay. This has been put on hold for the moment but I will continue to drop in every now and again to pick up helpful tips etc.We have very few new cases of Covid-19 being reported daily here in Ireland. It would suit me fine to fly direct to Menorca and stay there if they were in a similar position.What concerns me is the number of UK visitors that would be visiting at the same time. The UK statistics are pretty horrendous and I really don't want to take any risks.The daily reporting of cases is pretty good in Ireland. We get the figures at about 6 p.m. every day. This is not uploaded on the to World Info website until after that announcement. We get plenty of information on numbers, however we are lacking in the finer details. For example we know that about 50% of all cases are from close contact. We never quite get the information on where this close contact might be happening. The same with community transmissions. We never really are told...where in the community. Is it in supermarkets, on the street, public transport etc.I am sure that all new cases are asked questions as to where they have been in the past couple of weeks....I am sure that it would be easy enough to state that these new cases all seemed to have picked it up using public transport or similar. It would be good to know."
Been following this thread for a few weeks on the chance we may make it out at the end of July. Planning on staying in an apartment in es castell. Just wondering what the current rules are. Do you need to wear masks all the time ie on the beach. I assume not in resturants! What's the rules for pool use with a pool in a small shared apartment block? Been coming to the island for30 years since childhood and will really miss our visit if we cant come.
"Hi Jenni. You do not have to wear a mask all the time. You must wear one on any form of public transport and in taxis. They should also been worn in shops or other enclosed spaces and outside if it is not possible to maintain a distance of 2m from other people. On beaches it is mandatory to be at least 2m away from others, so masks are not required.The rules around private pools in owner complexes are complex and still being looked at.A law is just going through to impose 100€ fines for non compliance of the above regulations.I know that this isn’t related to your question, but are you satisfied that the place you are staying in Es Castell has a tourist licence... few have one as it is not in a permitted zone."
Hi quality spy. Thanks for your reply. We are happy with were we are staying its not a rental. Thanks for the warning though. We are well aware of the restrictions. Sounds like masks are being warn as they are going to be here which is fine
We've just had our jet 2 holiday for 5.7.20 cancelled!!
"That’s really crap for you. Cannot understand why Jet2 are cancelling July bookings. 1st July the island is fully open for international tourism. Did they give an explanation or option to change hotel? Sorry..Edited: 12:59 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Hi I assume jet2 has cancelled due to uk residents not being allowed to travel for non essential travel and a 14 day quarantine when you return,the risk of infection in the uk is still high"
No said they are booking all holidays before 15th july now
"We’ve just had our holiday for 11th July cancelled, also booked with Jet2. Not sure what to do for the best, re-book for the 15th with the hope that will go ahead, or just get a refund. The same holiday next year is now £1300 more. Jet2 have changed the dates twice now (understandably not their fault) so not sure what to do for the best. Will the Island be up and running for tourists by the 16th, ie shops, bars, restaurants etc open?Edited: 2:24 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Just seen a similar post on the Mallorca forum for Jet2. As the islands are committed to reopening to international tourism from 1st July, places will be open to welcome tourists from Spain, Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. There may be something going on behind the scenes regarding UK tourists, but nothing has hit the press or TV yet."
My local news has just reported it will be mid July onwards (northern Ireland) I would expect the same for the whole of the uk as we have been doing considerably well. Mainland was a few weeks ahead of us and we went into lockdown fairly quick and numbers have been reasonably low and no deaths reported last few days.
Jet2 have also updated their Facebook to confirm all bookings prior to 15th July will be automatically refunded.
HelloWe're due to fly out on 24th August.....what do you think? Will we make it?
"All down to FO as to whether airlines fly , let’s hope so , but no one can answer"
"Not the news we wanted to hear......“Menorca registers two positives after 43 days without infectionIt is about a couple from Menorca who on Tuesday arrived at the island by plane from Palma with a stopover in Madrid from Bolivia. They are isolated at home.“Source, Menorca diario this lunchtime."
Oh no that's not good news. Lets hope they recover quickly and that it is contained.
"Hello Nicci, try looking for facebook groups pages where the resident community is often active with updates on what bars etc are opening up etc"
"Hi Nicci, there's a we love cala n Forcat group on Facebook that's really good. There's not a huge amount open yet, Frankie's, Tropical Kiss and Gigi's are open but from what I can gather most places are waiting until the beginning of July. I think that's when Los Delfines restaurant is opening."
"Just to keep you up to date, this has just hit the headlines in the online Menorca daily paper.“Menorca registers two other positive cases for coronavirus. This is a young couple from the Islands who came to Menorca last week from the United States. Since they arrived on the island, they are isolated and have had no contact with other people.“It is inevitable that cases will occur now that movement across the EU as well as mainland Spain are happening on a daily basis. However, apparently a sound track and trace system is in place with people registering at the airport and the two ports on arrival. However, we are an island and it is the season for people with their boats to arrive from pretty much anywhere. They moor in the coves and just off the beaches then come ashore for a few hours. No chance of track and trace happening. Fingers crossed that this doesn’t put people off visiting the island as the businesses are in dire straights."
"Hello qualityspy, it is maybe inevitable that new cases/infections, outbreaks even will occur as more movement happens.People will need to be sensible and follow guidlines, which is maybe harder to achieve in holiday destinations.Events in arragon should remind people that things can change quickly.Atb steve"
"Sad to hear of two new cases and even though they wore masks and had a private cabin on the boat from Barcelona they will have been in proximity to others waiting to get on the boat. I wonder if Ciutadella will be able to contain this even though the fiestas are officially cancelled. It does make me nervous lockdown is being lifted too rapidly. Just after Mallorca was keen to welcome back Germans the abattoir cases emerged.Edited: 7:20 am, June 24, 2020 "
"This is being driven by the economic necessity, rather than science, as in many countries. It’s the way it is. Risk dying from the virus or the effects of extreme poverty?"
https://tinyurl.com/y89ecv2kThis is what my friend Eugenia says makes her ashamed of her fellow Menorcans yesterday.
OH my goodness whereabouts is this taken?the restaurant owners haven't done much for social distancing there have they .
So far as I can tell it is in Ciutadella - the square up from Ses Voltes I think.
Yes Ciutadella.
The front page of the diario with photos of Ciutadella yesterday was shocking. There are calls for the mayor to resign. No hope really.
Yes gather it even made Spanish RTVE news.
"Sant Joan, Young Majorcans?"
"Menorcans. Calls for the mayor to be sacked.Edited: 11:02 am, June 25, 2020 "
Have read today that Menorca has had it's first case for some time. An elderly lady from Cuitadella who went into hospital for a routine appointment and has tested positive for Covid. Am I right in thinking then that all hopital attendees get a routine test? After test and trace it appears she has had no contact with the other recent cases (who have all arrived on the island recently) and all her recent contacts have tested negative. It seems a bit of a mystery as to why she has contracted the virus with reports that perhaps she picked it up from the supermarket. The crowds from last week during what should have been the fiesta are adding to speculation. This just shows how there could be so many people out there still who are asymptomatic. Very scary and makes me feel it still isn't the time for foreign holidays yet.
"Pomado could you please let us know where you read the information about the lady contacting the virus , if not hopefully Quality spy can give a local take on it soon ."
"Hi Margaret, I read about it on theMenorca info, Es Diari webpage."
"Yes, correct reported in the online edition today. But, it is odd because no one else out of her contacts has tested positive and she appears to be asymptomatic. Strange for a very elderly person. There is the possibility of a false positive, so worth watching as the story unfolds.Edited: 10:48 am, June 29, 2020 "
"Thanks both for the info , does seem strange"
"Hi, I’m due to be flying over to Punta Prima on the 31st July, can anyone advise of current guideline with regards to facecoverings and beach guidelines? We are due to be staying at the club sur menorca thanks in advance."
"Just in case anyone has heard rumours of new outbreaks on the Balearics. There are currently 8 active outbreaks on Mallorca and 1 outbreak on Ibiza. None are active on Menorca. But, it does demonstrate that it has not gone away by a long chalk."
"Hi, would you be able to tell me when the Mar de Menorca Hotel is either due to open or if it will open at all this year? I’m due to fly there in 4 weeks. Thanks."
"Do you mean the Grupotels Mar de Menorca in Cala Canutells ? To be sure I suggest that you contact the management direct on +34 971 153 100 or email marmenorca@grupotel.com . There is also a call centre number for the Grupotels chain call center 902 404 444 (Service time 9 am to 6 pm)  Whether if you are on a package booking your tour operator will still operate the package itself ( flights seem to be more of a problem at the moment than accommodation) is another thing. I would establish first if the hotel itself is open and then contact the tour operator for clarificationEdited: 9:28 am, July 08, 2020 "
Oh my - not what you want to hear. It was a Spaniard then - better than a pesky British tourist I suppose but not what the island's tourist authorities want to hear
Yes it says 4 active cases on Menorca. Suppose it was bound to happen but the comments show the underlying anger. Would be even worse if it were 'giris'.
"....masks may become compulsory for a period to damp down outbreaks after easing of tourist lockdown - in BalearicsEdited: 1:24 am, July 09, 2020 "
I really hope so. Catalunya made them compulsory yesterday. In the narrow streets of Mahon and Ciutadella a distance of 1.5m is not possible as people without masks make no attempt at keeping any distance.
"Compulsory from this weekend. From today’s paper:The use of the mask will be mandatory in the Balearic Islands from this weekend. This will be determined by a resolution of the Govern that will be published in the BOIB this Friday or Saturday, in order to prevent the spread of the outbreak of the new coronavirus"
"Hi, we are hoping to have a family holiday here in August. Do you know if the face masks will be compulsory round pools and on the beach? Thanks Craig"
The government has announced that face masks are not mandatory on the beaches. Awaiting the actual decree to see what they say about hotel and shared pools. Private pools within a villa that you are renting are fine.
Do you know whether they are in a resort or in an apartment in Ciutadella? What a nightmare that will be for the other people in the same complex
Not known. Health authorities have declined to provide details in case it causes alarm!
Any more updates please
"No more cases reported today. The three family members reported positive and the one child that was not, have been moved to another location to quarantine until all clear. So no big outbreak to worry anyone so far."
"Hi all,Looking at booking a family holiday (2 kids, age 7&3) for September. We are looking at the Nelva hotel.Is the general consensious that holidaying is safe this year?Thanks in advance"
"Nobody can answer that - you have to decide yourself if flying is worth the risk - for me personally the flights there and back and spending time in airports is more worrying than being on the island As this thread is about providing up to date info on any outbreaks etc, QS1 (who was the original author of it and lives on the island) is well placed to give details as and when they occur. A lot could happen between now and September - it wouldn't take too many tourists to arrive ignoring mask wearing rules to cause an outbreak . Having said that, the risk here of the same thing happening is an issue too - you have to make a decision and stick to it . I am hoping to get to the island in September but have yet to persuade my husband ! BTW If you want more info about the place you mention (it is an apartment complex BTW not an hotel and is not close to the beach) there are reviews on the Cala N' Porter forumEdited: 4:29 pm, July 15, 2020 "
".Thanks for your reply. Yes, lots to consider, although EasyJet offer a flight change option up to two weeks before if needed. Plus the flights are very reasonable at present!We have researched the accomodation and we prefer villas. Also like the daily walk to the beach as well. Stayed at simolar complex in Son Bou last year and it was fantastic."
Hi. Which apartments in Son Bou please.? Don’t recognise the name ..
"|Apologies, poor typing. It should have read 'a similar complex in Son Bou'. It was Playa Gold"
"Totally agree about the airport/flying being the worry. I've posted on another thread about coming over late August with our 6 year old. If we could RentaGhost and hold our nose to transport us the Villa it's the perfect holiday to avoid other people ! Our little one prefers the pool to the beach, so we would be in our own space 90% of the time. We are worried about him having to wear a mask for what would be roughly 6 hours including taxi's, airport time, flying etc. He will naturally want to take off his mask, and we don't want to get into a battle on our supposedly relaxing quiet Menorcan break. As with all things right now, I think it's completely down to your own personal choice, what risk you feel is there to you and your loved ones. We are 50/50 at present."

"Jifmeister - why not try and get (or make) him some kiddie sized ""fun material"" facemasks. There are lots of YouTube DIY face mask videos and some only require really minimal sewing skills so it could even be a parent or granny and child activity to make them together ( he may be more inclined to wear it if he helped make it)_. If you get him used to wearing a mask in advance it shouldn't be too awful and once he gets to Menorca he will see local children wearing them out and about too It will probably be easier to reinforce why masks are necessary before the trip happens anyway because once the new UK mask wearing regulations come into effect next week here, he will see far more grown ups wearing them as a matter of course and start to understand why rules about them have to be stuck to!"
"Just a thought, but the decree says that people over age 6 must wear a mask. It does not say people aged 6 years and over."
"Many thanks for your replies and comments. Funnily enough he already has two masks of his own design (well, Darth Vader and Chelsea FC! ) I found a site in lockdown that would print any images you liked. To 'fun up' the trip he has chosen some more characters to make another set of masks. New swimming goggles ordered as well, so full on bribery working a treat ! He seems quite relaxed now, and we have been liaising with the lovely Andres at Cafeteria Binbequer Vell who has been updating us on the situation. We have bitten the bullet, and will be taking our original booking, and the owner has also agreed to letting us increase our stay so we are going for 2 weeks, just to give that extra time between the airport/flying experience. Binibeca is so quiet it will be the perfect location. Can't wait now. Thank you again for all your comments/suggestions. These forums are so helpful."
I agree - have a lovely holiday. Could you please give us details of the mask printing website you mentioned in Post 286 Jifmeister - I am sure others might find it useful so a link would be great
"Thanks everyone. Here is the link to the website I had used to print the little man's masks.https://www.contrado.co.uk/We've ordered some for ourselves (we have been using a plain cotton one until now), will feedback on how the adult one's look/feel when they arrive in the next couple of days."
Great - please report back on the quality when they arrive Jifmeister - if we are going to all wear masks a lot at home as well it is quite fun to be able to personalise them !
"Agree completely , let’s hope all stay safe , hard to imagine all these locals here will have to wear masks this coming weekend , shopping this morning , apart from staff , Bill was the only one wearing a mask , think the more you wear the masks the more normal it gets"
"Unfortunately the papers are now reporting 10 active cases, the highest number since May and they are not thought to be related. One, the cemetery worker from Ciutadella is in the Mateu Orfila.. The sad fact is that as soon as flights were opened up this was bound to happen and attempts to stop the flights from some affected areas like Catalonia and South America (via other cities obviously) have not been successful. It is up to everyone to be vigilant and follow the guidelines."

"From now on I think we should just listen and get advice about the current updates on covid 19,from Quality Spy who lives on the island more helpful than some off the updates from other sources."
Meaning Press and Media etc.
"Unfortunately, not everyone is follow guidelines. Look at QS neighbours that didnt self isolate for 14 days. Ryanair is business as normal on their flights apparently. Some people think it is back to normal and there is no risk in travelling."

"The map that is in this link shows the current outbreaks in Spain and the islands, both big and small. If you click on one of the dots the figures will come up. Current at midday today.https:/…2018947.shtml"
"There are mixed media messages here saying that face masks need to be worn on the beach, can anyone confirm or deny? Thanks"
"Hi loads of posts on this, please look down the forum Quality Spy lives on the island and has give very up to date advice ,"
"Great news I still haven't booked yet ,but hoping to travel end sept beginning of October :-)"
That good positive news . I really need my holiday !
"Noboday wears mask in the beach. I have just come back from Menorca. In the hotels, shops, streets everybody wears it. Sometimes where we were alone in the street we did not wear it because of the heat. Menorca is very clean."
"QS, Is there any restrictions in place that will stop the virus being spread from mainland Spain hotspots to the Balearics? I see today from Barcelona alone there were I think 10+ flights to the Balearics. Concerning given the clusters of cases going on at the moment. I’ve heard from many who are currently on the islands, a lot of the tourists at the moment are from mainland Spain.Cheers in advance."
"Hi. Our regional government requested central government put in some controls on movement between the mainland and the islands. The answer was a big fat ‘no’. So, we share your concerns.... but no power to do anything at all."
"What a difference one day makeshttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53540691Looks like quarantine is back from Spain into the UK :-( Our suncream only arrived from Amazon this morning :-(Optimistically, the dictates change on a regular basis and we have 3 weeks to go....."
"We’re the same, planned to go in 3 weeks. Guess we need to understand the statement from the government to see if includes islands"
"Totally agree, here's hoping some localisation sense will be applied"
