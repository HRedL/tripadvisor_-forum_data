Westjet just released details of flights that have confirmed virus cases. Would be nice if all airlines did this.https:/â€¦
"would of been even nicer if they would of done this from day one... a bit late to the party.Haven't read the article yet, however, if they are only selecting certain rows it's pointless... people touch the backs of seats as they walk up and down the isles AND they even use the bathrooms on board."
"and there ya go... they are ASSuming that people didn't use the bathrooms,,, fargin fidiots."
"deb,They are saying anyone on those flights should self quarantine - just that those in specific rows are of particular interest.Mark"
