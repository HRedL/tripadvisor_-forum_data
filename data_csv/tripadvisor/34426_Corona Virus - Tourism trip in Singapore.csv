"Please refer to the official websites and news channels for updates. Sorry, this is the forum for Singapore and I’m not familiar with Malaysia websites but you can google or ask on the Malaysia forum. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…https://www.channelnewsasia.com/https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanhttps://www.gov.sg/Edited: 1:59 am, February 02, 2020 "
"In addition to the resources already posted, you might try the Straits Times (Singapore) and New Straits Times (Malaysia) websites. Both have good coverage of the local situation regarding coronavirus. (Malaysia also has a health ministry website, but it is in Malay so I wasn't able to use it as a resource). Last I checked, there were about 18 cases in Singapore and 8 in Malaysia with no local transmission. Both countries are anticipating the possibility of more cases and seem well prepared. My family has a trip planned for the second half of February and we decided to wait until a few days before to make a final decision because we feel there will be a better sense of whether the disease will spread by that time.Edited: 8:04 am, February 02, 2020 "
"Dear Jess:so finally did you go?? how did you find the situation there (if you made the trip finally)? did you get transportation and food -all okay? was the public attractions open?Edited: 1:17 am, February 17, 2020 "

Please review herehttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…Thank you
"I am also planning to go in 2nd week of March, did you go ? is yes how was the situation there ?Thanks Pratik"
"Everyone's situation is different , wether they went or not should not effect your decision, you need to read the official info which is a pinned post on this forum and also #5 has given you a link to it and then make up your own mind."
Change your destination to Indonesia as NO recorded cases there.
"The situation is in control in Singapore. However, you would have read and heard that the infections have spread to more countries like South Korea and even Iran and Italy. Influx of virus carriers has so far been restricted by controlling entry of people from China which has so far been the only major source of infections. However, if the infections spread to multiple countries, as is happening now, one cannot rule out the virus entering Singapore with travelers from these countries. How this situation is perceived will vary from person to person."
"@Travel_FreakSingapore is pretty safe, but going on a cruise at this juncture is highly risky IMO. Are you sure you want to go on a cruise after reading about the ordeal that passengers on Diamond Princess went through? Even those so came out uninfected had to go through a harrowing time."
The OP made this post two days before the travel date so they have either cancelled the trip or already done the trip by this time.
