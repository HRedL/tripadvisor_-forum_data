"For what it is worth, my accommodation provider, Valamar, has indicated they intend to open their hotels and camping grounds in late May, subject to government restrictions on their operations.Whether that actually means people will start arriving I don't know, but I'm looking for any encouraging signs I can find."
"Speaking about current epidemic, I'm becoming more and more sceptical, comparing statistics of other years of yearly flu epidemic, counting per capita deaths and numbers of those with virus and looking for statistics in Sweden and Belarus, who choose not to use drastic carantine measures in order not to destroy their economic.And today I can say - IMO it's somehow artificially created hystery of masses on the fone of real spreading of virus infection. Northern, Eastern, and Central Europe in reality haven't serious epidemic.And knowing that Latvia government already borrowed 500 millions in a European Investment bank because of so called fighting against covid, I start to understand who will have profit from this. Banking sector. Even situation in all the world with all big numbers together isn't up to yearly flu epidemic.From the beginning was much contradictory information about current virus.But if we will follow in TV, who can create their own reality, test all with the yearly flu, monitor all deaths, count all cases, panic is guaranteed, and governments introduce harsh measures,we will receive the same and even worse situation.But never governments introduced so harsh measures for dealing with flu up to destroying countries economics. I understand panic with covid in the beginning, but it's time to normalise life, including travel and tourism."
"Frankly speaking it seems early to me, even compared to places like Greece (tourist season should open for foreigners from July) where weather is hotter and has very low virus impact.Let's seeEdited: 2:15 pm, May 04, 2020 "
Everyone must have freedom to choose what for him is early or not.
@JimA when do you intend to travel? I am sure you know that our government is not allowing us to travel overseas and are not opening our borders any time soon. The only overseas travel that we might be able to do for this year is to New Zealand. We sadly did our last cancellation for our holiday today. I am hoping that they change their minds and open our borders sooner than later.
"Hi Chef, yes, it is hard. I hate not knowing when we can travel again. It is something I really look forward to and usually have two holidays booked at the same time. I am always checking the news just in case the Australian Government have announced that they have changed their minds and the borders are open. No such luck. We cannot even travel in our own State. My State of Western Australia is a large State and we have regional borders which are all closed. We thought since we can't travel overseas that we will go up to the beautiful north of our State and spend part of winter up there as is it is lovely and tropical, but we even have to wait for our regional borders to open. Hopefully, they might open later this month. It must be awful for you not to be able to go to your house in Istria. I feel for you. I think I would be crying every day. Hopefully, you will somehow be able to go later in the year."
"Zadarfan, re post 6.I'm not due to go until August, and I'm living in hope because, as we've already seen over the last week, things are changing quickly. Once the momentum for an easing of restrictions gathers steam, and when people and governments see that the sky is no longer falling, things might improve faster than we all think.Of course, that is all assuming the sky doesn't fall in again.We Aussies might be a bit better off than our friends in the USA and Canada and the UK because our suffering hasn't been bad by world standards, and we might even get on the list of 'good' countries for entry.At the moment though, I'm living vicariously through threads like this, and I'm hoping people like Tarik keep us informed and encouraged, even if we have to wait until next year."
