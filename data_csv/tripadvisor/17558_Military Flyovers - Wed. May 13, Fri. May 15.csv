"So everyone in central California knows - do not be alarmed if you see and hear military aircraft flying low this week.On Wednesday starting at 10:00 a.m., the California Air National Guard will do a flyover out of a base in Fresno as a tribute to health care and first response personnel. The approximate itinerary from Fresno to Sacramento, the Bay Area, and Los Angeles is given in this article.https:/…On Friday, the Air Force will fly over Redding, Red Bluff, Chico, Paradise, and the northern Mother Lode starting at noon from Beale AFB.https:/…"
We don't get the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds? What kind of garbage is that?
"They're too far away. The Blue Angels are better positioned to fly over Mar-A-Lago. And the Thunderbirds may have done a flyover of Death Valley, because they're based at Nellis AFB in Nevada. But Area 51 is next door, so wouldn't you think they'd send a squad of UFOs instead?"
A squadron of flying saucers would work.
"The only low-flying flyovers I have seen had a space shuttle on the aircraft's back! Along the Sacramento River. It was an awesome sight. Also one time only, historic moment."

"The Thunderbirds will be in SoCal on Friday. Starting just north of the border in San Diego County at noon, crossing Orange County and then reaching Los Angeles County by 1:10 PM.afthunderbirds.com/site/…"
Better to spend the money buying some PPE and donate to the hospitals.
That will be a grand sight. Looking forward to it.

"Yes, and I am driving out to HMB to have lunch and walk around the beach. But I am doing this to honor our front line workers, so it's all OK."

"Well it was a zero in SF. Neither heard nor saw anything. I realize they weren’t coming over the city but I thought I’d hear it at least. Quite low overcast and some rain may have changed their plans. I’d really like to know how much this little outing cost. While states and local governments have the largest deficits in history, the feds have left them out to dry."
"Healthcare professionals on staff at one of the flyover San Jose hospitals. It was very cloudy so we heard them first and saw them as they did their low flyover. It was very quick. I was actually working from home this morning and all the neighbors came out to see and thanked me and other frontline workers on the block.I appreciate the efforts but also wonder about costs. Do they not need training anyway so hopefully this was not more?We actually see and hear military planes regularly here in the South Bay due to Moffet Airfield being near by.Edited: 4:43 pm, May 13, 2020 "
augh can't edit my typos. PPE supplies BTW are getting better but it still stinks the lack of national coordination for PPE and testing and recovery plan.We are still reusing N95 masks (and surgical masks) and face shields for no Covid patiens. Out of SaniWipes(medical grade wipes) which we use to clean surfaces between patients. SaniWipes only needs 2 min contact time. We have to use a daily mixed solution that takes 10 mins contact time.We are now doing testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and people getting elective procedures and OB patients having babies. So finding more positive. This is the new normal and I hope a vaccine is available soon. Meanwhile people with non emergent but needed to prevent emergencies procedures are slowing getting scheduled. We are still doing vaccinations for kids so we don't have a measles or whooping cough outbreak. Yes it's been a long grind but we need to all do our parts. Wear your masks and wash your hands.
This is the squadron's FB page...https://www.facebook.com/144thFighterWing/There are videos of their take off and over the State Capitol. Will probably have more later.
Thanks for your work chinita. Hope you and your family are doing well. It's tough to be a medical professional with a your kid at home.
Yes thank you And nurses do all the hard work.What a rush it must be flying one of those Jets.
"I'd have to think the money for these flyovers is coming out of the training budget. Pilots are required to fly a certain number of hours per month or quarter, and these flights would count towards that.Edited: 5:27 pm, May 13, 2020 "
Here's the flyover from my hospital...https:/…
"The California Air National Guard 144th Fighter Wing out of Fresno is on active alert every day even though it is a Guard unit. The 144th is the first response air defense unit for the entire California coast line. As the first air defense line, the 144th maintains two aircraft armed and loaded on alert status at all times at Fresno Yosemite International Airport. Additional unit alert aircraft are based at March Air Reserve Base in Southern California. The aircraft and pilots are in the air in minutes if an unknown aircraft approaches the coast. Here in Fresno we see and hear the fighters operate nearly every day."
Thanks FresnoFacts - I wonder if it is them that I see and hear regularly here near Moffet. Looks like them. Sometimes just 1 or 2 jets at a time.
"Very interesting. Now I wonder if they are among the aircraft that fly through Rainbow Canyon, AKA Star Wars Canyon or the Jedi Transition.Someone had to be quick to get that video going by Santa Clara."
>>>Someone had to be quick to get that video going by Santa Clara.<<<We knew when they were going to be here and our social media team is pretty savy.
>>>And nurses do all the hard work.<<<Yup. I am not a nurse but you bet we spoiled ours this week as it is Nurses Week. We are outpatient and pediatrics so not frontline but still seeing families. It's the adults that bring the kids in and our own coworkers that we worry about.
"They did fly over the Bay Area, but I must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thanks to the Air National Guard and other military aviators for their tribute to health care and first response folks. The saluters and the salutees all deserve a huge ""thank you"" from the public for being among those who help keep us all safe.https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/slideshow…"
Thank you for this - we used to love the El Toro Air Shows when I was in college (UCI). We'll definitely keep an eye out for the SoCal flyover tomorrow.
"Not enough money for PPE or rent assistance or food for people but enough funds for a joy ride by some guys in the national guard. You honor the essentail workers by only doing what is ESSENTIAL and joy riding in a jet is inappropriate. We waste more than a trllion dollars a year on the miltary and it has made the USA less safe and the world less safe and millions of people have lost their homes, their families, and their lives thanks to us."
"Agree. The states are hundreds of billions of dollars in the hole. This was in no way essential. And certainly training requirements could be waived or put on hold. You don’t thank medical workers, first responders and other essential workers by wasting money. You thank them by making them as safe as they can possibly be. And hopefully paying them better.Unfortunately the federal government isn’t treating this like the national emergency it is. States are doing the best they can but a properly organized federal response would have made this circus a whole lot better.Edited: 6:25 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"We are not in Asia where they take epidemics and the elderly seriously. We are in the US where we feel we are exceptional, worship the young, think we are not subject to the laws of nature."
"Medical worker here. While there are many criticism I have for the lack of federal coordination, wasting money for these flyovers in not one.>>>The Department Defense said that while the ""America Strong"" showcase is intended to bring Americans together to fight the spread of the coronavirus, it also serves as an important training opportunity for both the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds.""Pilots must execute a minimum number of flight hours to maintain proficiency,"" according to a joint statement from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. ""These flyovers will incur no additional cost to taxpayers.""<<<<https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-liv…"
Flyover at the closed Disneyland Resort:https:/…
Wow just wow.It's also National Military month! Then flyovers to honor first responders.Do you know how many medical people died from Covid19 armchair quarterbacks.How about the military who serves this country and become severely disabled and become homeless and destitute after keeping us safe and alive.Whatever bubble you live in just stay there.I hope neither of these professionals comes across these comments.God Bless the USAAnd thank you for your service.
Some people aren't happy unless they are miserable.The Thunderbirds were awesome.It was worth every penny to bring smiles to people's faces in the middle of this grim lockdown.
It’s great that some who serve honor others who serve.
