"I will be in Lisbon on the 22nd and see that the Lisbon Half Marathon is that day. I have the map of the route but I am wondering what transit interruptions to expect headed in the Belem direction, and for how long. Is it best to steer clear entirely? Will there be effects anywhere else? Thanks."
"Hi,The question is other, will Lisbon Marathon gonna happen?I think the Lisbon 1/2 marathon is going to be canceled because of corona Virus, the same already happened to Paris, Rome and Barcelona. The marathon course will affect the main road between Lisbon and Belem at the riverfront, it will be close like many side roads. You can still visit Belem but the best transport option will be the train."
"Lisbon Half Marathon - postponed to September, because of the new rules for events (indoor and outdoor) due to Covid19 epidemics,"
Thank you for updating.
Half marathon is postponed until October due to crowds and virus.
