"We are set to touchdown in Istanbul in 10 days (unless USA issues a travel warning for turkey or Turkish air cancels the flight. We are well aware of the hand washing regime and alcohol based hand sanitizers. However, looking for a silver lining to the anxiety inducing corona virus—are the main tourist sites having less visitors? I’m not one to purchase the usually pricy “skip the line” type of tickets. Please let me know—it’s just my husband and I, no children to get bothered standing in a line!"
"""are the main tourist sites having less visitors"" No, but it's March, so you shouldn'thave trouble anyway. :)"
"Monica, İt is pretty safe here with no known cases of coronavirus infection so far. However it is best to follow the strict hygiene rules. Here is some relevant advice: ""https:/…advice-for-public"". Furthermore here is the relevant Info about the spread of this infection: ""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"".There are no lines in front of museums as this is low season and you do not have to buy passes or hire a guide.Enigma..."
"Hi,China, Italy and Iran flights are cancelled where it will decrease number of tourists as well.Btw, online tickets for skipping queues are not ""pricey"" https://muze.gov.tr/A."
"Buying tickets online from the government website doesn’t cost any extra. It does cut down on time wasted and sore feet if there’s Rae queues at ticket offices.Edited: 1:23 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"don't want to buy anything in advance at this point--no telling what my country's dear leader will do ie, seal off borders to air travel, etc etc (and yes, I obviously know there are more cases of corona virus in the usa than in turkey, but trump does not use reasoning skills in decision making). so, don't want to be stuck with advance purchases, and yes, i have travel insurance, but want to avoid making claims if necessary."
"You don't have to buy the museum pass on-line. Just buy at the first main site you visit like Hagai Sofia, Topkapi, Istanbul Archaeologic, etc. The name is the Istanbul Museum Pass and it saves both time and money.Good that you're visiting now before the mega cruise ships return later in the year and overwhelm a number of the sites."
