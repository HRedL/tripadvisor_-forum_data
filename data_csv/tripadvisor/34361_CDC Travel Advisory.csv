"The CDC seldom issues travel advisories, but have just released this: https:/â€¦travel-in-the-us.htmlTravel safely,Hunt"
"""Will you or your travel companion(s) be in close contact with others during your trip?Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 may increase in crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air circulation, if there are people in the crowd who are sick. This may include settings such as conferences, public events (like concerts and sporting events), religious gatherings, public spaces (like movie theatres and shopping malls), and public transportation (like buses, metro, trains).""In other words....""Are you planning to fly there?"""
Thanks Hunt. Was waiting for this. First of several. They are gradually putting together the pieces to empower the government to issue a limited domestic travel ban.
"Upstate_Guy,I think that you are correct.First, State of Emergency, which is needed to get many programs to start/trigger, then likely other measures ready to launch.Domestic, non-essential travel bans could be on the table?Will be interesting,Hunt"
"I think restrictions on domestic air travel in the US are inevitable - it's just a question of when and what restrictions they put in place.I am equally sure that there will be those who fully support any restrictions whilst others will say they are young, healthy and not in a at risk group so they should be allowed to continue to fly."
