"Hi all, I will be in Iceland in 2 weeks and I see that they can put you in quarantine also if not tested positive but 1 passenger sitting within 2 rows from you is tested positive. This is really scary in my opinion, I'm reducing the contacts as much as possible to prevent getting covid but i can't control others. Does anybody heard about these cases? I'm flying from the Netherlands with transavia, does anybody have experience with this flight?"
"Yes, that a risk that currently everyone who is travelling is taking. Both my flight to and from Iceland in the last two weeks were pretty much fully booked.Here is the relevant passage from the covid.is website:""In the event of an obligatory self-quarantineA negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not later be required to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to infection, e.g. on the flight to Iceland. The contact tracing team interviews those who have been in close contact with a confirmed active case during two days prior to the onset of symptoms , e.g. been within 2 meters of an individual for more than 15 minutes, or those who have sat beside an infected individual on an airplane. They might be required to self-quarantine for two weeks from the time of last contact.The following applies if the individual was wearing a face mask (medical mask) and adhered to guidelines regarding hygiene and infection control as recommended. If those conditions are not met then the situation is evaluated and who needs to be quarantine possibly expanded.Contact tracing is done for passengers within the 2 rows around a SARS-CoV-2 positively tested case. Contact tracing is performed in general from 24 hours before his/her symptoms started (from 24 hours before diagnostic testing if asymptomatic). All these passengers should be informed about the exposure. Only passengers sitting directly next to the index patient will be defined as close contacts (high risk exposure). If the index patient sat on the aisle, the person sitting on the other side of the aisle will not be categorized as close contact (unless there is another indication, such as a travel partner/family, direct touch, coughed or sneezed on).As a result, in most events, there will be 1−2 close contacts, all other persons would be contact persons with a lower risk of infection (low risk of exposure).Please note that violations of quarantine or isolation requirements are subject to fines or enforcement action from the relevant authorities to ensure compliance.

You're right It is scary. That's why travel is not really recommended at this time. It is a lot of money to spend on something that is associated with SO many risks.
"As I read it, if wearing a mask (as everyone is expected to do) you’ll only have to quarantine, if the passenger next to you has a positive test. Everyone within 2 rows will be informed, but will not have to quarantine.We flew on July 24th and are having a fantastic time in Iceland:-)The 100 people max are coursing some troubles, we spoke to a lady with a camper, and she had been rejected at several camp sites due to numbers (even though the site was not “full”, just at 100 persons)Also trips and geo baths need to be booked well in advance.Our first accommodations were hotels with buffet breakfast- that was scary: many people just walking in without using hand sanitizer before touching utensils and lids:-(We now have an apartment and I like it so much better:-)"
