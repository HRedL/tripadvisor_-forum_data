"With apologies to Gidget.I'm a bit tired of reading through all the arguments about why Indonesia does or doesn't have coronavirus and what is and isn't fake news on this thread https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29… So this post is just for what is happening in Bali at the moment. Rumours, mask availability, any reports of someone having flu-like symptoms, any flight disruptions, that kind of thing. If you want to discuss whether there is a cover-up and what the various news and medical sites are saying about coronavirus in Indonesia, please go to the other thread."
"Hello Mel, all good in Legian and Seminyak atm. Masks are available in Carrefour but no one is wearing them out and about. It stills appears busy to me but the locals are reporting it’s very quiet, they are all getting excited about Galungan on the 19th Feb with preparations well underway."
"Thanks Glenn. I think I will get a mask before leaving Oz for the airport, even if it's just a psychological support mask. I was in Ubud once for Galungan once, it was really fun and festive. Enjoy!"
It is not really necessary to wear a mask. it is more vital that you keep your hands clean and away from your face.Most masks will not prevent bacteria getting into the sides unless you get the N95.Take plenty of antiseptic wipes Aqium.https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020…
"Virus only attack weak person, so the statistic death of 2019nCov is 80percent above 60 years old. Virus has self limited life. Eat well with high protein, sleep well, do not too tired. Regulars visitor know a lot to maintain healthiness without a rush."
"Ha, knew it. Didn't take long did it Mel?"
"Sigh....you cannot keep Sawa G from posting the same stuff he posted on the other thread. We will all be reading the same posts twice now.MelMMMM, hate to ask but would you consider deleting your thread?"

Looking forward to your HNR Richard. I'll try and beat you to it!
"Haha. You are correct Mac. Never heard anything different, even when there's a few of you at the same time, at their shop/stall."
My Singaporean friend who is currently working in Bali said all is still okay in Bali. I asked if he can purchase masks and hand sanitizers in advance for me and he told me don’t be silly. LOLL I’m arriving in two weeks time. Hope all is well still.
"Singaporean maybe correct, although Singapore has Orange Status. This is the first post about it."
"I’m looking forward to the HNR’s from you guys. I’ll be there 22March and can’t wait to read about all the fun you’re having.I won’t be taking/wearing masks, but will be using hand sanitizer (which I always do anyway) but will probably take anti bacterial wipes for plane and toilets etc (which I’ve never done)."
"My thread seems to be hijacked by Sarwa...I posted it purely for info...thanks for the apology to by the way Mel xEdited: 2:23 am, February 09, 2020 "
#14. Singaporean maybe right.
Love your comment Mac. Spot on.
