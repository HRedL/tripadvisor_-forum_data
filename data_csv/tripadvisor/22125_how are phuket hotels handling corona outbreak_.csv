"Some hotels are offering free of charge rebooking options due to corona virus outbreak , even if it was already fully paid (without cancellation option). Can anyone share an experience on this ? Any details how mandarave resort and spa in Karon beach is handling this ?"
"Panan Resort in Krabi. We had booked up, pre paid, no cancellation or changes allowed, this was stipulated at the time of booking.Emailed and they said no problem, you can postpone, no charges. Only stipulation is, if the room price increases at the time of visit then we pay the difference. Cynically, even if they do raise their prices I will pay the difference for two reasons. They could have said no changes etc but have been understanding and they will be hit hard by all of the cancellations. Personally think they have been brilliant."
very nice handled indeed by the hotel !!
"Interesting to find out some more info on this - we are booked into the Mandarava via BA as part of their package holiday, and we've now accepted a credit voucher instead."
most BA flights are cancelled
Our hotel in Khao Lak cancelled for free a month after the free cancellation option ended.Check RAC travel insurance for coronavirus cover. Â£80 for my whole trip and covered for most coronavirus related delays or cancellations.
Booked direct with The Mandarava hotel emailed them yesterday and have been offered a full refund.
"Thanks for the info, will soon also have to contact them to reschedule our planned holidays; Looks there is some flexibility from their side ! Which is great."
"Also got the option for full refund, great flexibility and service from the Mandarava resort and spa. Will certainly visit them next year when life has returned to a more normal mode."
