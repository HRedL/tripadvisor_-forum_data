"Hi there, I need help please. I am from Canada and want to fly to Portugal in December. I have a 3-5 hour layover in London Gatwick, am I allowed to proceed without any self isolation or any restrictions?"
How can anyone know what Covid-19 restrictions might be in force five months from now?
Currently you don’t need to quarantine /isolate if in transit. Later....who knows?
Thank you) ... I feel better knowing this.
"If this is all one ticket then you won't actually enter the UK - you will stay in the international transit area at Gatwick, on British soil but in no-man's land for practical purposes. Even if the UK were to re-impose quarantine measures they would be unlikely to affect those in transit and remaining airside.Edited: 3:27 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Rather depends on which airline is operating Gatwick-Portugal. If it is Easyjet, you cannot use the airside transit facility, even though it might appear you have a through ticket - instead you have to cross the UK border, collect your baggage, then redeposit it at the Gatwick Connects desk in the baggage hall. After that you make your way landside through security to the departure gate."
"Saying you have a 3-5 hour layover suggests you'll be on a through ticket, but then again I've seen people on separate tickets using the same word.It makes a lot of difference to what you'll have to do at Gatwick."
"Thank you) ... I fly in to UK with WestJet then have to collect luggage and board Air Portugal airlines 3-4 hours later, will that be ok?"
"If you have to collect your luggage then you will pass UK border control, but if nothing changes by December or if it is as now, then you can fly this route, Canadians are not required to self isolate. And in any case it would not be required for such a short layover."
"Looin at the Westjet airline page TAP isnt on their list interlining airlineshttps:/…airline-partnersSo unless there are exclusion, you should be able to check through. That makes the connection a workable one.If these were totally disconnected separate tickets, or you dont get the check through then 3-4 hours on separate tickets is just way too risky for me with - too much loss if things go wrong/Edited: 10:15 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Westjet are usually considered to be a low cost airline, so I doubt they offer single tickets with Europe based airlines with a true connection at Gatwick. I haven't checked whether they use the same terminal as TAP either. However, as you will have to pass through UK immigration to collect any luggage and then check in for the onward flight, I would think you would want in winter at least a 4 hour window for delayed incoming flight or other issues.SWT"
Canadians are not required to self isolate? Is canada in the exemption list?
Canadians are required to self isolate. Canada is not on the exemption list.

"""Westjet are usually considered to be a low cost airline, so I doubt they offer single tickets with Europe based airlines with a true connection at Gatwick""I don't know about TAP, but I do know that Westjet codeshare with KLM - so the above is not accurate."
"Post 13 - that link is to the countries that the foreign office says you can do non essential travel to now. Canada isn’t on the no quarantine list.Edited: 2:52 pm, July 10, 2020 "
Try scrolling further downn ;-))?>>>Americas Antigua & Barbuda Bahamas Barbados Bermuda Canada Cayman Islands Dominica Grenada Jamaica Martinique South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands St Kitts and Nevis St Lucia St Pierre and Miquelon St Vincent and The Grenadines Trinidad and Tobago Turks and Caicos Islands
That list is the “exempt from all but essential travel list”. It is not the same as the “do not have to self isolate / quarantine” list (or travel corridor list).
"ooops - you're absolutely right, thanks for correcting that. Here's the 14 day list - https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors"
Thank you for your replies. I guess this means that I wouldn't be able to board a connecting flight to Portugal and it would be risky to try?
"Hi there :) currently, your booking is considered a ""landside"" transit and will require you to pass through border control. https:/…layovers-and-transiting Because of this, you will not be exempt from the UK quarantine rules (this list exempts ""airside"" travellers, but not ""landside"" travellers). https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c… There is a list of 65 countries exempt from the quarantine rules but Canada is not yet on it https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors the list is updates every three weeks so keep checking back but at the moment, you are still required to self-isolate. I'm in the same situation and I really hope things change!! Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, best of luck!"
"If you are passing landslide for another flight you do not need to self isolate for 14 days, but only for as long as you are in UK - so if staying overnight it is 1 day isolation and so on."
