"Per this report dated August 24, 2019:https:/…""The latest warning comes after a spike of 100 new cases in Auckland within a week, with confirmed cases in the city now nudging 600 for the year making it the worst outbreak in two decadesThe Health Ministry has been seeking urgent advice on how to tackle the extremely infectious and potentially deadly virus."""
There's also just been a second case in Queenstown. Not sure whether related to the case from Disneyland. https:/…second-measles-case-queenstownCue vaccination discussions!
"If people had their vaccinations, this would not pose any problem (except for very young children). I had measles (also mumps and chicken pox) as a child before vaccinations so no worries for me now but I have been vaccinated as a teenager against polio (that was a real worry in the 50's) then, when travelling in the 70's small pox, cholera, tetanus, not sure about typhoid. In recent years influenza (every year), pneumonia and shingles."
#2 exactly. but one of the measles cases in auckland travelled to disneyland and on international flight in contagious state.
"Our latest PM, Boris Johnson, is urging people in the UK to have their children vaccinated, 5 in 1, I think, but there is a resistance from some parents, conspiracy theories etc.The UK no longer has measles free status, according to the WHO."
Interesting how after the recent outbreak in Auckland how many AntiVaxers suddenly switched sides. To the point where there was a shortage of vaccine. Certainly hope none of their children died.
So the earth isn't flat?Why do these people play Russian Roulette with their children's health.It also demostrates how distance no longer protects us.
"This REALLY annoys me, and it's often people who have degrees and are supposedly ""educated"" who believe the hype. Vaccines do not cause autism. Everyone travelling to New Zealand - make sure your vaccinations are up to date. Measles can wreak havoc on the immune system, long after the disease itself has been vanquished."
"Hi,Is the situation still the same? Is it only limited to Auckland or across the nation?Thanks"
"#8 the latest case this week was a traveller from Samoa on an international flight who had measles (so contracted overseas, not in nz). Auckland has been hit the hardest with some schools advising those students who have not been immunised to stay at home. A NZ Post workplace has also been affected.Auckland has been hit the hardest, but we are a mobile nation and it spreads easily https:/…2019-measles-outbreak-information"
"Specifically, the Counties-Manukau DHB area (i.e. southern and eastern Auckland metro) is the worst hit, followed by the other two Auckland metro DHBs (Waitemata and Auckland). Cases outside Auckckalnd are sporadic. ESR is monitoring the outbreak, and their lastest statistics are here: https:/…WeeklyMeasles26082019.pdf"
https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/1154…When a rugby secondary school sports tournament is cancelled due to the measles outbreak you know things are getting serious. Non immunised persons are being advised to avoid travel to Auckland locally.792 confirmed casesEdited: 1 year ago 
We are due there in October with a 8 month old baby - should we delay? I have heard you can now get babies vaccinator from 6 months but still makes me nervous!
"For the adults - if you have been vaccinated you should be fine to travel to Auckland at this time.For babies - check with your doctor, as peace of mind is beyond price."
we too are scheduled to travel on 8th Oct. And very nervous too. Contemplating going straight to Rotorua instead of staying in Auckland
"And it’s all thanks to the irresponsible, misinformed, brain-washed anti-vax brigade....makes me so angry. This small but significant minority are undoing decades of amazing advancements in public health. The 8 mth old can be vaccinated 2 weeks prior to travel BTW but check with your GP for latest advice. Will also be ongoing updates/advice on MOH website."
"one of the biggest issues is that people on the plane coming into, or out of nz have been measles carriers and not aware. Planes are notorious for spreading illness and thats where i would be most concerned. Actually being in Auckland isnt so much the issue as the spread is prevalent in non tourist areas."
Yes I agree nzp0ppy...unless the tourists are going to be spending time in South Auckland (with family for example) the risk would be less.
"Nax (post #14), how old is your baby? If over 12months discuss bringing forward his/her vaccination with your nurse.If older than 15 months then I assume s/he will be fully vaccinated so nothing to worry about.Edited: 1 year ago "
"As others have said, the plane and airport terminal are the most hazardous places."
Baby will be 8 months old when we go. Turning 7 months in a week and a half. We are from Aus and the Measles vaccination is given at 12 months. I've read we can have it earlier but I am a bit nervous about the effectiveness
I strongly suggest you discuss with your GP. I doubt anyone here will have the knowledge.
LOL Brian...I am a GP...or was before taking a blessedly early retirement (bloody awful job). So knowledge not always up to date on everything. But my understanding is vax from 6/12 is current rec for travelling babies. Although it is a good point the OP (or other traveller) makes about efficacy at 6/12. I would be confident it wdn’t be being recommended however if there wasn’t an expectation of efficacy and the benefits outweighing the risks etc. Possibly a case of not being as effective as when gvn a bit later but still better than not giving at all in such high risk circumstances. Hope that makes sense.
I too work in health care. I agree with Kristabel's advice.
"PM Update Today:There have now been 963 cases of measles confirmed across the country, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says.Ministry of Health's Director-General Ashley Bloomfield said evidence suggested shortfall in vaccination rates was related to hesitancy and lack of access, rather than direct opposition to vaccines or ""anti-vaxxers""."
"#24 its not lack of access. Mire like laziness, or beliefs. And complicancy. Its free to get the vaccine for all nz citizens and always has been. But Auckland is a very transisent city and diverse. But nz health system is way way way more accessible than most in the world, and definitely more so than usa (i lived in usa so know that).Edited: 2:39 pm, September 02, 2019 "
"nzp0ppy,""#24 its not lack of access""You need to take that up with the Ministry of Health's Director-General Ashley Bloomfield - that's the reporting of his words not mine.Edited: 3:09 pm, September 02, 2019 "
"I find ""lack of acess"" quite strange. Most Dr in Christchurch don't charge for children under 14.Edited: 4:00 pm, September 02, 2019 "
"Vaccinations are free, the amount of people that were choosing not to have vaccines due to ""lack of access"" would be quite low I'd think. And if they lived out in the wops, they'd be the ones at low risk.If it's through extreme poverty and unable to afford petrol or bus fare to a doctors surgery, there are public health nurses and other services who can remedy this. Remember, this is not an issue that only affects children, adults must be vaccinated too if they haven't either had measles or already be vaccinated.Edited: 4:42 pm, September 02, 2019 "
"""If it's through extreme poverty and unable to afford petrol or bus fare to a doctors surgery, there are public health nurses and other services who can remedy this"". Absolutely true...outreach nurses working in the community move heaven and earth to get vaccines to those unable to get to Dr's surgery. It is the ant-vaxers who are the biggest problem here re declining rates of uptake. The MOH spokes-person sounds typical of those working in an ivory tower with no clue about what's going on at 'the coal face'."
"#29 latest data today shows the high income areas of Auckland have one of the worse uptakes of immunisations. Herd mentality. My kids got their vaccines at school in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nurses went in and all across nz the immunisations were done in schools. This was actually a third jab as they wanted to ensure coverage of all school kids. However, its like gambling and drink driving - some people just play the odds."
"Just for your information, childhood vaccinations in New Zealand are given at 6 weeks, 3 months, 5 months, 15 months, 4 years, and 11-12 years (intermediate school). The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given in two doses, at 15 months and at 4 years."

"Again, swim fan, there is not a huge risk to visitors. Yes, they need to be aware of it but most will not be at undue risk at this point."
"Lc,unfortunately, not all are heeding that childhood vaccination schedule you mentioned for New Zealand as the PM has reported almost 1000 measles cases so far and rising."

"Anyhow, this is going round and round in circles so it's pointless continuing. On the one hand you say in your title ""if travelling to Auckland note measles case rise"" and on the other you keep posting links for the girl who travelled to LA. I'm not sure what your agenda is here but this thread isn't serving any sort of purpose any more. Treat this wth the same caution you would travelling to any country with an outbreak of disease, protect yourself as necessary and then try not to worry too much.Edited: 7:05 am, September 03, 2019 "

"When I travel frequently overseas I ensure all my vacinations are up to date - hep a, thyphoid, and if needed yellow fever, malaria tablets (if going to an area with malaria) , rabies (if needed). Basically it is the travellers responsibility when travelling to be informed and get necessary immunisations.Coming to NZ you need measles vacinattion.#31 there was a third MMP jab introduced in late 1990 and early 2000 for all schoolkids to ensure coverage so many of that generation have had an extra jab."
"#39 - there was no ""third jab"" of MMR. In 2001, they moved the second dose of MMR from 11 years to 4 years, with a catch-up dose for those aged 5 to 10 years."
"#40 yes there was. both my children had it at school. it was nationwide. it was third jab and designed to catch all those that had missed the second jab earlier. my neighbour was a nurse administering them in the schools locally and for most kids it was a third jab, but for those that missed the early ones it was a second MMR.But only two are needed for MMR immunity.Edited: 4:53 am, September 04, 2019 "
"NZPoppy -post #39 - thanks for that... just been trying to figure out this evening if I had my booster/ 2nd MMR jab - ive got record of a shot in the early 90s when a young teen. Need to dig out the Plunket book to double check earlier vaccinations - though mum thinks she'd got me the two earlier shots when a preschooler.OP/ general - we've now 7 cases here in Queenstown. As a teacher of preschool children we were discussing with colleagues today about us adults checking our immunity, because we'd hate to spread it to unvaccinatable little ones. In the case of Queenstown, residents and tourists alike are all at risk, as we share similar spaces regularly - domestic flights, restaurants, skifields. (Though most of the current cases are locals, some have been in places with many tourists) https:/…more-measles-cases-queenstownI've also read reports about measles reaching epidemic levels in the US - and with our global mobility these days I think it is currently quite a serious global issue - we're all responsible for taking care to protect ourselves and fellow humans"
"My evil side is inquiring how people who refused to vaccinate their children are feeling now.It is also inquiring if an innocent child dies as a result of this epidemic, would people then be more willing to be vaccinating themselves and their children?On the radio going into work on Monday afternoon, was a rather distraught lady whose child is currently in the ICU at an Auckland hospital. There's nothing they could do - at one stage the family were told death was quite possible. Thankfully, the illness has receded a little, except now they're wondering about brain damage instead. The lady said she wouldn't wish this on anyone, and is bitterly wishing she had agreed to have her children vaccinnated. Stacey Morrison interviewed her very sensitively, I think."
"pineapple ""I've also read reports about measles reaching epidemic levels in the US""Please get a sense of proportion. The CDC just reported 1,234 cases in the USA this year. NZ has ~ 1,000 cases. Sounds similar, until you consider population difference. There are 4,700,000 people in NZ and 329,403,690 in the USA; 70 times more people in the USA; so to equal the current outbreak in NZ the USA would need to be reporting 70,000 measles cases. I truly hope we do not reach this level and that the NZ outbreak begins to level off and decline.Edited: 6:19 am, September 04, 2019 "
"#41 - I was born in 1991 so I was right in the middle of the change. I had my first MMR dose at 15 months and my second dose at age 6, during the 1997 outbreak. During the 2001 switchover, I was offered the MMR vaccine again but I didn't need it due to already having two doses. Of course, it also depends on the DHB you lived in too - South Island DHBs do vaccines differently from North Island DHBs."
"#42 - the second dose for measles was only added in 1992, so it's unlikely."
"#44 apologies SwimFan.I totally understand the population difference - though, personally I think that, no matter the population, increasing cases of an avoidable disease is tragic. I checked to refresh my memory of what I'd read - rather than 'epidemic levels', what I read was the concern over the current outbreak especially amongst orthodox communities in New York, and that new cases are regularly reported. It also seems that it's a possibility that the US will lose its 'measles eliminated' status (and with 1000cases vs NZ population, I'm sure we've lost that, if we had it :-() https:/…index.htmlLet's hope that people are able to get their vaccinations, current people suffering with measles are able to be quarantined until they're no longer contagious, and that we can re-eliminate the disease worldwide.LCM #46 - haven't found the Plunket book this evening - mum's sure I had the two shots as a toddler early 80s; then that extra booster shot is recorded in more recent vaccination booklet as '93 for me - so it seems that I'm super covered!!!

"Pineapple #47 - Are you sure you're not confusing it with the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine? That's four doses at 6 weeks, 3 months, 5 months, and 4 years, followed by boosters at 11 years, 45 years and 65 years."
