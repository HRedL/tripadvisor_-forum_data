"Bermuda will re-open to travellers arriving by air starting July 1, 2020. Our island home has always been a precious resource set apart by its geographic location and its way of life. Over the last several months, we've been dedicated to protecting our community and pristine destination for our residents and guests to enjoy for years to come. When you are ready, we look forward to extending a warm welcome to you out here. For more details: https://bit.ly/3fecNtK"
"Please clarify- you need a Covid test and proof of health insurance before arriving- no problem. Then, after landing, you get retested and have to quarantine until the results are in ? I think I will wait and travel elsewhere for awhile. My holiday time is precious and short ( would probably do a long weekend to BDA) and wouldn’t want to pay $$$ to have to quarantine for who knows how long.Please clarify if I misunderstood?"
"I guess Bermuda does not want to see any Canadians on the island, given the extreme measures being taken. Canadians CANNOT simply go to a testing centre an ask for a test because you want to travel. Tests are ONLY done for those who either have symptoms or have been exposed to a person who has tested positive. These ridiculous measures will ensure no visitors will come. I wii NEVER come to Bermuda again."
"One more thing, there is NO insurance policy under the sun that will cover COVID-19 illness.I think Bermuda needs to seriously rethink these draconian measures, if they ever hope to attract ant tourists. Maybe demand the COVID-19 tests for those coming from countries that still do not have the virus under control, i.e. US. Canada has it under control.Edited: 9:56 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"I suspect that re-opening Bermuda for air travel has more to do with allowing Bermudians and other local residents who've been quarantined (either in Bermuda or abroad) to move about (business, medical, personal, etc.)....than actively re-opening Bermuda for tourism."
"... beyond the vagaries in the”guidance” for travelers, the Premier in last night’s press conference repeated at least 4 times his lack of confidence in the target of July 1 .... I did not hear anything close to a “welcome back” ..."
"You need to grow up and get real, mel2007."
The insurance point is a good one. I think that is not covered in most policies.
"I think one would have to contact their own personal Dr and see if they could assist. So far as never returning again that might be a little extreme. This is only the first phase of opening the airport and although not exactly a time I would want to go give them a chance to how it works and make what ever changes they feel are needed. I am thinking that most people thinking about going right away are going to stay pretty close to where they are staying and not venture out all that much. It is a catch 22 for any tourist destination, the locals need the income to get the economy back on track yet they in some ways probably really do not want us there for awhile. Just my thought."
"9thtimes....I would have to disagree with you. Not that I have any plans to go to Bermuda anytime soon, but if I did, I certainly wouldn't go to all that trouble and expense just to stay in or near my cottage the whole time. If I'm expected to stay indoors, why go at all? The problem for me would be the plane ride. I wouldn't feel comfortable right now being crammed into a small tube with 200 strangers rebreathing their air. And that wouldn't change....whether Bermuda itself opens up or not. Once there is a vaccine, I'll reconsider."
Well said 9thtimes. You are probably right KDKSAIL. Keep safe everyone and try to be patient for a little longer.
"David V, If I remember correctly from past comments you take your scooter all over the island, which is great and will give you much more freedom. I think my point was that if that was not an option for someone than they would have to rely public bus and ferry service and they may want to do that. My wife and I love to bounce around the island on the bus/ferry but at this time with the restrictions about passenger numbers it may make it too hard to be worth it. Also not sure how the local passengers who have been very friendly over the years are going to react to a bunch of tourist on their bus and ferry. Like I said it is a catch 22. Think for the time being I will stay put around the house. We were thinking about NH or ME for the 4th of July but alot of restrictions there too."
">>>...I think Bermuda needs to seriously rethink these draconian measures, if they ever hope to attract ant tourists...<<<As suggested above, I think that these early stages of reopening Bermuda have more to do with easing quarantine restrictions on resident Bermudians and Bermudians stranded abroad due to the crisis....than welcoming back tourists. There are no doubt Bermudians with necessary business, medical and personal/family needs that government is trying to address after many weeks of quarantine. I don't think that at these preliminary stages of reopening that they're overly concerned about inconvenience to vacationers who want a change of scene, while lying on a pink sand beach. Insofar as ""..draconian..' is concerned....I think that no matter the destination, we're all going to have to get used to a '..new normal..' for travel that would've been considered '..draconian..' a year or so ago....It'll be a brave new world with such travel restrictions required. Corvid-19 may have come and gone but I suspect that residual restrictions will remain in place against the potential of Corvid-20..21..31...ad nauseam.......or whatever inconvenient microbe decides to raise its infectious multi- faceted head in the future."
"9thtimes....you're right. I didn't even give a thought to people having to rely on buses and ferries at a time like this. So that would definitely affect your normal routine while visiting. To be honest, I have a feeling that all of this talk is going to be a moot point by August anyway. I REALLY hope that I'm wrong, but I suspect that the relaxing of restrictions by ALL countries in the next couple of months is just going to cause a resurgence of the virus. I mean, how could it not? Until there's a vaccine, I think we are likely to be living like this for the foreseeable future. Again, I hope I'm wrong."
The truth is that I would be happy at the moment to just get my hair cut safely. Traveling is way down on the list.
">>>... I didn't even give a thought to people having to rely on buses and ferries at a time like this. So that would definitely affect your normal routine while visiting...<<<In terms of social distancing requirements, Bermuda's public bus capacities are currently restricted to between nine(9) and seventeen(17) passengers (to facilitate social distancing protocols) (depending on the bus size & seating layout). Public ferries are a bit better, limiting passengers to fifty(50)....and this is for current limited service for local residents with most stores, shops, offices and businesses closed. Partial reopening of the local economy make getting out 'n about via public transportation for even a few visiting tourists a far less attractive/viable option."
"I have a trip scheduled for August, I’ll be happy to look at that beautiful ocean and be able to snorkel each day, that’s all I need! Can’t wait to be back to my favorite place!"
>>>...be able to snorkel each day...<<<Perhaps you can confirm that the Parrot Fish are maintaining a proper six(6) foot social distance in their schools ??....and/or Groupers are wearing proper PPE (Phish Protective Equipment) gill masks ??
"I may be missing something, but quarantine upon arrival is not mentioned. Social distancing is keeping 6 feet apart, no physical contact, etc. Regarding insurance, I think Covid treatment would be covered in a similar manner to other illnesses.Edited: 8:30 am, June 13, 2020 "
Upon arrival everyone will be tested and will have to go directly to their rental/hotel and wait there approximately 5 hours for the result of the test.
">>>...Upon arrival everyone will be tested and will have to go directly to their rental/hotel and wait there approximately 5 hours for the result of the test...<<<This excerpt from a recent interview regarding reopening by Zane DeSilva Jr (Minister of Tourism & Transport) in the Royal Gazette --""...Commercial flights to resume in Phase 4...""--(Royal Gazette--June 12, 2020)royalgazette.com/news/article/20200612/comme… ""... “As soon as possible following arrival in Bermuda, every passenger must undergo Covid-19 testing either at the airport or at their accommodations. Depending on the volume of tests, the results are expected to be received within 24 hours, but in most cases, the turnaround time will be less than eight hours.”He added guests would have to quarantine in their accommodation until their test results were delivered and that their temperature would be taken twice a day throughout their stay...""So at least SOME period (??) of quarantine upon arrival will be required."
"-----> Regarding insurance, I think Covid treatment would be covered in a similar manner to other illnesses<----Maybe, maybe not.. Make sure your travel insurance policy does NOT have a pandemic exclusion"
"... like most of you who are frequent return visitors to Bermuda, I enjoy returning (since 1963!) because Bermudians have been so warm, friendly and interesting ... unfortunately all that “warm and friendly “ seems to be icing over ... if tourists are thought to be unsafe then don’t have any!"
">>>...unfortunately all that “warm and friendly “ seems to be icing over ... if tourists are thought to be unsafe then don’t have any!...<<<I don't think that it matters a whit whether arrivals are tourists, Bermudians, returning residents or little bright blue men from Alpha Centauri. They're ALL potentially infectious. Bermuda is simply trying to do the prudent and responsible thing : restrict the entry of nasty little Corvid-19 microbes...no matter who might be carryin' 'em. I will admit that being '..classified..' in pretty much the same category as fresh fruit and produce (mealy bugs on bananas, etc.) is a bit harsh but, ""..needs must when the devil drives..""."
"KDsail,I am sure you are correct, but it is funny that quarantine is not mentioned in the Bermuda tourism link. And I never thought about whether or not my insurance would work abroad, for a pandemic. Definitely something to check into if traveling. I only wish I was planning a trip there!"
">>>...it is funny that quarantine is not mentioned in the Bermuda tourism link...<<<I'm not sure that all of the preventive measures that are planned have been finalized as yet>>>...And I never thought about whether or not my insurance would work abroad, for a pandemic. Definitely something to check into if traveling...<<<NOT all health insurance policies cover medical treatment received outside of the US....regardless of the disease or condition. So, it's always a good idea to check with your health care insurance provider directly about YOUR own coverage to make sure that there are no not-so-minor details and/or nasty not-so-little surprises should a medical emergency arise when you travel.As an example,...few health insurance policies cover emergency medevac should your situation require it. Dorothy was right, "". we're not in Kansas anymore..""."
"In addition to some quarantine temperature will be taken twice a day for length of stay. Not sure how that is going to happen. Or is it only while in quarantine?Personally, I think that it is still too early to travel."
"This all seems pretty ridiculous. Once you leave the airport, who's going to enforce a quarantine on you? Who's going to make sure you take your temperature twice a day? I can appreciate Bermuda wanting to be super cautious.....but why make rules you can't enforce? I don't mean to be a downer, but I have a feeling this is all going to be moot anyway. With the relaxation of the lockdown here in the U.S., the number of COVID cases are already on the rise again. By August, I wouldn't be surprised if we have a nationwide lockdown again. I'm with Senior65. It's still too early to travel."
">>>...I can appreciate Bermuda wanting to be super cautious.....but why make rules you can't enforce?...<<<I suppose that the rationale is to create potentially '..enforceable recommendations..' (if that's even a thing ??) I agree that actual '..enforcement..' would be difficult but they just can't say, '..use your own good judgement..' 'cause they and we know that there are just too many people wandering around without minder who are just too STUPID to know any better and care even less.You're probably also spot on about the second wave...'..rebound wave..' for lack of a better description. The collective patience of even ordinarily responsible people has been sorely tried by months of quarantines, sheltering-in-place, curfews, etc.. Even reasonably responsible people are ready to push at the edges of the envelope. And then there are the widespread economic consequences of the shut down.Like others, I don't think that the time has come yet for eliminating all of the travel restrictions. But it's difficult to make a compelling argument against it. To my mind there is more than enough valid evidence of a '..second wave..' but that evidence simply indicates potential from past epidemics. The case to be made for easing restrictions is that even the best and the brightest can't predict with certainty what the potential of Corvid-19 will actually be. There's black...there's white...and there's too much gray in between. It's becoming harder for people to subscribe to the '..Better safe than sorry..' dictum. I spoke to someone today that has an order in with his travel agent to book he and his wife into their favorite Mexican all-inclusive as soon as they reopen. His biggest concern seems to be sunburn...and is sure that that's why the gods-of-travel created high-SPF sunscreen. Regular applications of 50-SPF at one's cabana by the pool can minimize Corvid-19 as well."
"Was speaking yesterday to a fellow multi time visitor and we were taking about what it would be like to travel to Bermuda under the proposed guide lines that have been set at this moment Hypothetically if we departed Boston on say Sept 1 on either Jet Blue or Delta and stayed at our favorite hotel for five nights, the cost with out added expenses (MAP at Hotel) would be in the neighborhood of $4,000. (Plus drinks, taxis, lunch ect.) Than we discussed our arrival on day 1. Arrive at airport in BDA between 1-2 pm, get off planes in small groups, get tested, go through immigration/customs(On a good day in past 30-60 minutes may be double now)) get in taxis (Prearranged) for about a 45 minute ride to hotel. (Estimated time of arrival about 4 pm plus or minus. Go directly to room, no stopping at bar for a drink, not going to the pool, beach or anything for a minimum of 4-5 hours for test results to come back. At best it is now about 8-9pm, guess it's room service for the day. (Day one wasted) Day two should be fine as long as tests come back negative but God forbid it does not for many reasons. Some how I need to have my temp taken twice a day not sure by who or where or what time this is done, maybe they will come out to the beach and take it. Day three the same routine. Day four I have to be tested again and back to the room I go. Day five back to the testing. Day six departing BDA. Don't want to be so negative as my friends really want to go and have others that will join them but it will be at least until maybe NYE that I would even think about. Guess I will go sit in the back yard with my ocean music and little bottle of pink sand with a Rum Swizzle and dream."
... the official Bermuda Tourism web site still (15 June) makes no mention of arrival testing or twice daily temperature readings ... is this an omission or has the protocol been updated?
"Bear in mind that the www.gotobermuda.com web site is operated by the BERMUDA TOURISM AUTHORITY. BTA is a semi-autonomous, hybrid '..quango..'. It is not a direct agency of the Bermuda government.Bermuda's reopening is a four(4) Phase '..plan..', with each subsequent 'phase' predicated on the success or failure of the previous 'phase'. Bermuda is currently in Phase 3-- https://www.gov.bm/coronavirus-phase3 The Bermuda Tourism Authority is most certainly a prevalent/persuasive voice in the reopening '..plan..' discussion/debate but it does not set '..policy..'. Government does that. Given the '..phased..' nature of the '..plan ..' the final details of Phase 4--reopening the airport and tourism infrastructure are not set-in-stone at this point. Until government arrives at a final policy decision, I suspect that the BTA is maintaining a watching brief. ""...BTA cautious over airport reopening...""--(Royal Gazette--June 12, 2020)royalgazette.com/tourism/article/20200612/bt… ""...As government works to finalise the specifics of Phase 4 arrival protocols, potential travellers are already asking detailed questions about how to successfully meet the requirements—such as accessibility to testing in their home communities and receiving results within time constraints. BTA is working with government officials to share consumer input and concern to ensure the finalised plan is easy to understand and actionable ahead of a trip to Bermuda..."""
... guess that confirms that the official voice of matters relating to Bermuda tourism is the Oracle of Dionysus ...
>>>...... guess that confirms that the official voice of matters relating to Bermuda tourism is the Oracle of Dionysus ...<<<Well...either Dionysus or Bacchus...depending on which shore of the Ionian you happen to be on at the time. In either event grape and/or grain is the essential element for prediction.
... I’m Sicilian so that tips the scale to Dionysus .... who was also King of Siracusa when it was the powerhouse of Magna Grecia ... my oh my how things shift over a couple of millennia!
"I would have absolutely visited Bermuda again in August or September, but the idea of being quarantined in my hotel room for an unspecified amount of time kills the deal."
See article in Royal Gazette today in regards to airport opening and health insurance. Not sure how this effects things but it seems like it is going to be a lot of work to visit Bermuda this year.
">>>...See article in Royal Gazette today in regards to airport opening and health insurance...<<<""...Insurance weighs heavily on airport reopening...""--(Royal Gazette--June 17, 2020)royalgazette.com/news/article/20200617/insur… ...and as always...check with your own health and/or travel insurance providers DIRECTLY for the not-so-minor details of YOUR OWN particular insurance coverages."
"Lots of entitled travelers here who don't realize that we are still in a pandemic and the main source of travelers to Bermuda is spiking in cases. Bermuda has controlled and practically eliminated the virus on their island, and their #1 priority is protecting their own citizens. It's really just not time to travel yet, and I think Bermuda's requirements are pretty relaxed compared to many locations that are requiring a 14-day quarantine."
kdksail i sent you a pm--thx
"I have a planned trip this August. I think getting tested prior to arrival is perfectly acceptable. However, I’m not sure the test upon arrival will be that helpful/ and or effective.If anyone comes into contact with a positive covid person after being tested they won’t likely test positive 2 days after being exposed.Example: covid test in Wednesday for a Saturday flight. If exposed Thursday or Friday , it’s not likely anyone will have symptoms and or test positive by Saturday! Hence the 14 day incubation experts say it can take up to once exposed.Perhaps a mid-week stay test if staying longer than 5 daysEdited: 12:37 pm, June 18, 2020 "
No sistum are purphekt........but what's the alternative ??
I'm afraid that traveling internationally is going to be very difficult for a very long time. I don't think that we have quite grasped that yet.
"Agreed, until Canada removes the international travel advisory, any insurance purchased will be null and void.Not to mention the required 14 day quarantine requirement.The airlines will definately take your money, they don't care, if you denied boarding for any reason, they will give you a worthless voucher."
True!
"Interestingly, the Prime Minister of Barbados has written a letter to the Canadian PM, requesting a loosening of the international travel restrictions. She realizes that the way things are now, there wil not be any travel to her island from Canada.Apparently Bermuda says they will sell insurance policies that include COVID-19 coverage, but, as I said, they will be useless for Canadians.In Canada, we can survive without mass tourism, however, many of the islands cannot.If the protocols remain too stringent, I fear for their financial survival.I absolutely love Bermuda, and I hoped to come down in late August, but I now realize that just won't happen.Edited: 3:27 pm, June 18, 2020 "

"""Agreed, until Canada removes the international travel advisory, any insurance purchased will be null and void. . . Apparently Bermuda says they will sell insurance policies that include COVID-19 coverage, but, as I said, they will be useless for Canadians.""Hi, could you provide the source of this information? I can't find anything on the OHIP site about insurance voiding as a result of the travel advisory, and certainly not a private plan."
"The variations of consequence for someone testing positive for Covid-19 may (very often will) extend well beyond the individual traveler....to family, and other traveling companions. As example: there is absolutely NO advice or information on any charges or fees applied for the contingency of airline or hotel reservation cancellations policies, etc. or how potential quarantine restrictions apply to traveling companions who may test negative.Travel and Covid-19 is a can-of-worms that's been kicked over and there's no tellin' what will crawl out. For most of the travel industry it's a case of catch-as-catch-can.... make-it-up-as-we-go-along,"
