Wanting to travel to Noumea in July. Are there any problems with drinking water and any issues with mosquito carried epidemics as I see the Australian Govt. webpage mentions ongoing epidemics of three types. We would be staying in Noumea for a week only.
"We were aware of issues with Mozzies in New Caledonia when we cruised to the islands last month. Our GP gave us a course of anti malaria tabs to take as a precaution, as well it was a case of covering up and using tropical strength insect repellant. When swimming we put sunscreen on first followed by insect repellant with the result we didn't experience any problems. Because of issues with dengue fever and jika fever you just need to take sensible precautions and err on the cautious side. I can't help with the water side of your querie I would just use bottled water and avoid ice in drinks although the water in Noumea should be safe enough.Hope this helps."
"We have been thru Noumea 5 times never a problem with Malaria or other things if you are staying in a major resort water is not a problem ice in drinks at the resorts and salads no problems BUT ONLY IN THE RESORT, The market is down by the waterfront has a wonderful supply of foods and drinks just DON,T unless its a sealed bottle.We have just returned from FIJI which before we left a huge problem with DENGUE FEVER didn,t see anything use good mozzie spray plus we took with us a small auto indoor insect spray for the room that keeps all well.Enjoy the beautiful breads and a bakery which is out of town not far for even better bakery items I can,t think of the name but all locals know it"
"Hello,New Caledonia being a developed country, there is no risk consuming food and water. Especially compared to Vanuatu or Fiji for instance. Tap water can be drunk, it meets European Union standards which are very similar to Australian ones. You'll find a confirmation of this on Australian Dept of Foreign Affairs website: smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/â€¦New_CaledoniaMosquito carried epidemics are mostly relevant during the wet summer month, especially from January to May. In July you may not see any mosquito at all, but it is still advised to use repellent, especially if you intend to go in the countryside.Malaria tabs are useless, as there is no more malaria in New Caledonia than in Australia. You can check it on World Health Organization maps: http://www.who.int/ith/en/ (NC is the stick shaped island north of New Zealand)."
