"https:/…Effective immediately, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation is suspending the on-premises consumption of alcohol at bars statewide.The announcement comes Friday as Florida coronavirus cases continue to climb. Florida reported nearly 9,000 new cases, which shatters the previous single-day record."
I feel like kinda bad for asking but any idea if the QS food venues in DS will still offer adult beverages?
"Don't feel bad asking. I was just thinking myself how they are going to define ""bar"". Does onsite food make an exemption? It was just announced, so we will have to see. May have to go to Plan B tonight if that is the case."
"Don’t pile on me but I don’t see how theme parks can stay open or open as planned. Nearly 9000 new cases in a dayEdited: 12:34 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Probably because they are strict on the masks, but we shall see how long that lasts.I do know of at least one place following the rules shut down because they were informed that a patron had it. At least someone is following up, and that is a decent sign. Can't pile on anybody until the normal ,politically motivated idiots see this."
"It just feels so Twilight Zone to be planning to go right now. We’re only planning on outdoors stuff where we can maintain social distancing-the hotel pool, the beach and a spring, maybe some al fresco dining. I was considering a day at Universal (we both have APs) but will definitely skip it if we feel uncomfortable. We can still cancel, I just don’t know. I change my mind practically hourly. I’d have no problem quarantining once we get back, I stay home pretty much all the time anyway, but DH will have to go to work."
"The definition of ""bar"" might be open for interpretation if food is also served there.So many things to consider; the obvious one being how many people are going home before being diagnosed. Numbers could be up a whole lot more than we think.Another thing to consider for us Floridians; stay home."
"My Florida family tells me it's the same affect we've experienced in Arizona. The governor lifted some of the lockdown restrictions right before Memorial Day Weekend, and all the bars in Old Town Scottsdale and around ASU were packed with 20-somethings without masks and without social distancing. Unsurprisingly, there is a huge spike in cases among the 21-35 group. The Young Invincibles are finding they're not so invincible after all. This second wave here is entirely due to irresponsible behavior. The mayor of Scottsdale last Friday declared everyone in public meeting places must wear masks. One dope on the city council staged a protest against mandatory masks here Wednesday morning. This ""you can't make me, it infringes my rights"" crap is getting tiresome, and ignores the science as well as the obvious cause and effect we've just seen in this state. Florida seems to be the same."
That Scottsdale councilman should be fired. I can’t believe that he was so disrespectful to Mr Floyd.
"This irresponsible behaviour is also rife here in the uk. Sad to say, but yesterday, thousands of people flocked to the beaches in southern England. No social distancing, no masks. Every square inch of sand was heaving with families. A state of emergency was made. The authorities were powerless to stop people flooding in from out of town. In other areas of the UK, illegal raves have sprung up. Again the police powerless. On the 4th july our pubs, restaurants, cafes and hairdressers can reopen.Supposedly with the new one metre rule. The old two metre rule was broken repeatedly so what a cat in hells chance do we stand now.The nation awaits a second wave!I fear no holidays to Florida for some months to come because some half witted folk (both sides of the pond) cannot stick to the rules.Edited: 2:54 pm, June 26, 2020 "
The saddest thing about this is that it was inevitable.
"Sorry but it's Boris's fault as a lot of morons now think lockdown in England is over full stop!Wait for another few weeks and we will see the result of the (half a million apparently) idiots being on the beaches when cases spike and a second wave arrives.Edited: 3:13 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Found it.Secretary of Florida’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation Halsey Beshears order all vendors licensed to sell alcoholic drinks on the premises who derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from such sales of alcoholic beverages must suspend sales of alcoholic drinks for consumption on premises. However, those businesses can sell alcoholic beverages in sealed containers for consumption off the premises."
"“ s. One dope on the city council staged a protest against mandatory masks here Wednesday morning. This ""you can't make me, it infringes my rights"" crap is getting tiresome, and ignores the science as well as the obvious cause and effect we've just seen in this state. Florida seems to be the same.”Face masks are the new IQ test."
Hangar Bar is closed.https:/…
"""Sorry but it's Boris's fault as a lot of morons now think lockdown in England is over full stop!""This is just silly.Boris has nothing to do with FL and their late lockdown, and even earlier opening than the UK whne their curve was still going up. Sure Boris could have done things better, esp when he wasnt in intensive care himself. But that doenst excuse DeSantos's complete idiocy. The scientists (incl me) said when states like TX and FL were opening too early that this would happen. Around memorial day i think. But no one listened really."
"Amanx I think you misread the thread as Boris is blamed for UK beaches. But I hear and agree with you.What is up with all the random Disney Springs reported closings, Uniqlo the most recent. Are they closing due to a positive employee? Seems like it."
"Yes, Amanx. Here in the U.S. we've been especially stupid to open things up just in time for a major holiday weekend, Memorial Day. The Young Invincibles took the relaxation for 'all clear' and flooded the bars. You would have thought the governor would have seen that coming and waited until the holiday weekend was over before allowing the bars to open. Here in AZ, a number of bar owners who didn't enforce any of the distancing or mask rules are just now getting questioned on whether their liquor licenses should be suspended for non-compliance. Personally, I think the bar owners didn't really care and just wanted to catch up on their lost revenue. Our Old Town area has a bunch of hot spot bars the kids go to and they were packed to the point of overflowing out into the sidewalks. Us old farts who stay home, except to go to the grocery store are in better shape with the virus than the twentysomethings right now. In the U.S. I think we've been stupid about holidays back into March when we let all the kids go to Fort Lauderdale and pack the beaches for Spring Break. The science is clear, but there's a good chunk of America that doesn't want to believe it."
"A sealed container is a sealed bottle or can. It usually includes growlers too, but I'm seeing some conflicting information on the growlers which would really suck.The good news is that even though I can't drink other people's good beer at the bar, mine is ready. I can drink my own at my own bar, but I still miss the people that make better beer than my beginner sh*t."
">>Face masks are the new IQ test.<<And it’s a low bar to “average.” California is having its own spike. However, the mayor of SF delayed opening of next phase due Monday. Bars have never opened here. We don’t have indoor dining. We had a HUGE case number yesterday. Slightly over 100. 7 day average still about 40. Total deaths fewer than 50. That’s TOTAL deaths. Since this bitch monster arrived. Yeah, for a city of nearly 900K. SF has the second highest density of any US city after NYC. It can be done."
"It doesn’t even have to be sealed at Disney Springs. They are still serving open cups just like before. Two locations closed and the rest are still open, including the freestanding open bars."
"Actually saw a report that there is a lot of good that can come from the lowering of the infection rate that it will help get past this less of an impact because the younger generation has a much much lower hospitalization rate. Masks are not the answer. They don’t cure a thing and unless you are planning on wearing one for the rest of your life, we will never get past this. There are only two way to get out of this. You either confront it head on or a working immunization and that won’t happen any time soon."
"Unless you plan on dying around the time that a vaccine in available, there will be no need to wear a mask for the rest your life in order to keep the infection rate down."
"""This irresponsible behaviour is also rife here in the uk""Correction -""This irresponsible behaviour is also rife here in **England**""Wales, and Northern Ireland well on top of things and Scotland on the verge of eradication.Sadly, the other more responsible countries wihin the UK sill suffer the consequences of some terrible planning and decision making in Westminster and be subject to UK wide travel bans and restrictions."
Though problems in Wales McHaggis with folk deciding to do as they please..So a little more than “just” in England..
"We have morons in Scotland too, just haven’t got the warm weather."
"I think Mike you have missed the point and WJ- i completely agree, however the *facts are*Scotland and the other countries in the UK outside of England will be held to UK travel restrictions based on the incidence of CV19 in *England*. This isn't a question of morons. Every country has them.Just using the current numbers, Scotland is now reporting handfuls of new cases and zero to one or two deaths a day. But, we are tied to UK imposed restrictions because Westminster cannot get the position under control *in England*. Don't mistake this for a race or country of origin issue, its not. This is about a **government** who have failed continuously in their decision making processes and it is impacting on the other countries within the current union who have pretty much gotten their act together in a much more sane manner.The post I reacted to was clearly making the oft-held (and often unconscious) position that UK=England.I just wonder* how Westminster would be operating if England were on less than 2 deaths but Scotland had about 200 a day still.*doesn't wonder - I think I know what would be happening."
"On the beaches picture day , police were dispersing large crowds out of Kelvingrove park so breaking guidelines is not restricted by nation they are everywhere. However it is also fact that cases and deaths have a significant divergence across the 4 nations now, just as the regions of the 4 nations have all through. Although new case positives against those tested is a small proportion across all nations the absolute numbers in England continues to be in t he 100’s a day. You can debate why that is leadership, where virus cycle was when entered lockdown, speed of easing, etc. However blanket rules across all of the U.K. does not make sense. Similar to how France and Spain Emerged each nation and regions within U.K. are at difference stages now based on data.However from a travel point of view not sure how it helps as how do you distinguish between those areas effectively? Especially if you are border protection in the US. Simple level can fly from Scotland Northern Ireland. Only works if you then vet who gets on them live there too, and don’t work elsewhere, or it’s not a second home. Living in an area where incidence has been lower than average across the U.K. totally get the frustration. Not stopped two trips to crem and one where we couldn’t. Travel, which caused the original spread, needs to be restricted between areas of ultra low cases"
"New Florida record number of daily cases 9565.Edited: 11:46 am, June 27, 2020 "
"It isn't a coincidence that things opened up just before Memorial Day in states that depend on tourists. Can anyone guess when they will shut down again? That's right, just after Labor Day when the tourists are mostly gone. It's no wonder the case numbers in Florida are surging. It's all about the money."
Yep and the number of deaths hasn’t. Sounds like we are on the road to letting it run it’s course no matter how fearful some of you are.
He’s back from under the bridge...
Best not to feed the troll SDT!!!
"I’m finished traveller, I promise!"
"Ok Sunngod, this might sound a bit harsh but at the moment you have put your head above the parapet So you are fair game. . It’s people like you that have been responsible for the uptick in COVID cases. If your half as rabid in your own community as you are on here or if you just reflect the thoughts of your circle of friends then you are responsible for people not taking the virus seriously. A few months ago I said to you “that numbers are people” and you scuttled away and wouldn’t debate with me. Every case is one closer to an ICU unit being overwhelmed, every ICU bed being used is one that can’t be used by someone who has had a heart attack or a car wreck. People need to take responsibility and not downplay this horrible disease. Hope you get to read this before it’s pulled."
"Fluffy.As I see it, there are two scenarios here with sunngod.1. They simply don't think the virus exists, they are immune, they don't know anyone who has it/had it and it's ""just the flu"". The rest of us are ""nervous nellies"" especially fi we wear masks. or 2....they are simply trolling and having a whale of a time doing so and winding people up on here.I think it's number 2."
Traveller He is entitled to his opinion as are we. They have been on this site for years and at times gives great advice from the perspective of a local but that doesn’t give them carte.blanche to use this platform unchallenged.
"Or it’s #3 that life has to go on. Just like it has with Ebola, SARS, aids, swine flu, Zika. There will also be contagious viruses. But that doesn’t mean life stops. I don’t doubt that at some point we all will catch this one and the majority will recover. I know two people with it right now and they feel fine. Neither has gone to the hospital and they have very few symptoms. People can’t wait years for a vaccine to be available. A vaccine that many probably won’t even get. In the US only like 40% of adults get a flu shot."
"Tenni are you Sunngod or are you Malthus?Edited: 4:26 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"Neither but you know that. I’m not saying I agree with everything he’s saying and the fact that he does it in such a goading way. However in talking to people, they are just trying to have normal. And I’m sure everyone knows there is no real way to keep it from spreading at the theme parks. Even at a lower capacity that is still tens of thousands of people. We should all take precautions but how long do you want people on lockdown? A vaccine is at least a year away. No one is going to stay locked up for that long."
The problem is that your governments were to late to the lockdown party and to early to the beach party. That’s why today Florida has over 9000 new cases and 24 deaths. It’s now growing exponentially in Orange County with nearly 1000 cases today. I weep for you I really do and I hope you accept that I’m being sincere when I say that.
"I absolutely love the personal attacks. So fitting from a Destination Expert. I wonder if TA approves? In any case Fluffy Tenni is spot on. The reality of this disease is that it isn't the end of days and we have seen much worse. The mask nonsense and the ridiculous closing is an unnecessary panic. We have the greatest medical system on the planet. They have had plenty of time to prepare to deal with what is slightly worse than a bad flu season. I mean we dealt with covid before. It is nothing new. The way I see it is you can either confront it or try to hide. The problem with hiding is that that it isn't the boogey man and wont go way. Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer. You claim to be compassionate and care about others, then you should act as so. You are not doing the at risk any favors by dragging this out. In reality you could be making it worse because something we could have gotten over in a few months, you are putting them at risk by dragging it out even longer. The reality is the overwhelming majority of our population will have no issue, so what are you afraid of? This will not be over until mother nature runs her course and that means a substantial part of our population has to deal with it. I'm not sugar coating anything. That is the reality of life. You have no choice but to accept it. You may not like it, but the only other option is a vaccine and judging from our progress with a much more serious virus like AIDS, I don't see that as happening anytime soon. Sorry, but I live in the real world. Yours may be different."
"We can agree that our governor is a ding dong. And he has stated he won’t roll back reopening. The spreading and major increases in cases is inevitable at this point. Many companies are continuing to let their employees work remotely since the numbers are rising so drastically. And with the parks opening back up, bringing in people from out of the state, I expect numbers will continue to climb."
""" They have had plenty of time to prepare to deal with what is slightly worse than a bad flu season.""Let me fine tune that statement:We have already blown past the *worst* U.S. flu seasons mortality total. We will probably double or triple the record by the 1 year anniversary. So hardly "" slightly worse than a bad flu season""."
"Agreed that many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be unaffected and perhaps unaware of the infection.I simply don’t understand the stance that wearing a mask is useless. This flies in the face of scientific knowledge. Basically, the virus is spread by aerosolized droplets emerging from the respiratory openings in our faces. A mask, in fact any covering, will physically prevent almost all globs of saliva/mucus from aerosolizing (that is, becoming tiny enough to get through the mask). So wearing a mask incredibly reduces the chance of the virus getting out there to be caught by someone else. Bottom line: masks are pretty much to protect other people, not to protect you.Now, some words on the use of the word “FEAR.” I see this word overused and grossly misused. Yes, there are plenty of people out there who are truly fearful, waaaay out of proportion to their actual risk. But for all the rest of us wearing masks, it’s not about fear, it’s about taking a very simply precaution. Not fear, precaution. Ask yourself, do you wear a seatbelt in a car? Why, is it out of fear, are you scared every time you ride in a car? I hope not. I assume that, like most of us, you wear a seatbelt because it’s a simple precaution to greatly reduce your risk of serious injury. A simple precaution. It’s not used out of fear, it’s used out of, for lack of a better word, sense."
"Part of my job is to test new patients without symptoms and then call them if positive. I have had 2/20 positive and that phone call sucks. And them having it sucks. Luckily we are doing better with treatment. Stay distant, wear a mask."
"Sunngod, since you asked ..,,I do live in a different world to you!! I live in a world that has had no Covid desths for two days, a world that has our bars still closed and a world that mandates the wearing of masks on public transport. My world is called Scotland and according to reports we hope to be Covid free by the end of the summer."
"Fluffy, do you think that for some people if the virus has not touched them personally and they know of nobody with it they assume it's all been inflated for political gain. I think if anything the numbers have been underplayed, how many had it before we really knew what we were up against. The way the numbers are in Florida I do think Disney should rethink their opening, I know the economy needs it but it will only take one case to be traced and traced back to one of the parks for them to have to shut everything down again and any confidence visitors had will be quickly lost."
"Ok fluffy, what is your end game here? You plan to stay in hiding for eternity? The virus doesn’t go away. It is still there. You simply can’t sustain civilization without a functioning economy unless you plan to revert to the Stone Age. Are you more comfortable keeping people at risk and ruining lives in other ways than eliminating the threat? I’m not sure you are looking at the big picture. Of the only two ways this goes away there is only that is even a possibility for now. The other is a dream. Based on history, the dream isn’t likely."
I hope the UK take note of what is happening worldwide were due to open bars etc soon. Given the increase in infection and reduced social distancing it is a big mistake. Bad for the economy and small businesses but life is more important
"MarilynandmickYou are probably right my views are touched by experience and by the job I do,"
"Ah, I get it now. October is making money off of this. Now it makes sense. Keep spreading the fear so people will keep getting tests. There have been over 1.7 million tests in Florida. The cost for these tests average about $100 (they charge $125 if you show up without insurance). Simple math means those in the business here in Florida have brought in over $170,000,000 in testing alone. That doesn't count for what hospitals are charging for treatment. If I were in the testing business, I would want to drag this out for as long as I possibly could as well! Wear a mask indeed!"
"The bar closing doesn't apply to many businesses in my area as there are very few stand alone bars outside the university neighborhood. Most are restaurants by day and bars by night. They do at least 51% of their business in food so they remain open. Packed to the gills with drunken revelers taking no precautions.This will take its toll.It is ironic that those who are adamant that we need to get the economy going are also those that don't believe in taking cautionary measures. They will ultimately be the folks that keep the economy from starting up again. With the rise in cases, restaurants that don't do a significant bar trade are closing again and returning to take out only in order to protect their staff.Edited: 12:20 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"I hate facemasks with a passion, but if a mandate allows the theme parks to open, people to have jobs, and allows me to go out for entertainment, I can wear a scarf or a bandana over my nose for a few minutes at a time indoors.Again, everybody wants to argue. It is here. No buffer on face, no business open. You will eventually get shut down in Orange County. People want to scream over things they can't control.Make a choice, stay home or go out, but shut the hell up and stop screaming."
"I have a feeling someone on here protests too much and in truth is probably staying safely indoors, not venturing out very much and actually wearing a mask if they do!!!"
I am making money off of this? I am trying not to have my coworkers or myself laid off due to expenses. You are a tremendous $/?!. 60% of folks hospitalized in my area are under 50. I would give my left hand to not have had this pandemic happen while you won’t wear a mask. Stuff yourself.
"Quick thanks to all of you who reported the harassment- it was deleted for a while temporarily so I appreciate it. Stay safe, wear a mask."
October. sunngod is enjoying goading people. Best to ignore their ridiculous posts.
"October- the people of Texas are fortunate to have people like you who are brave enough to actually take care of them during this awful time. I know I’m feeding the troll here but sometimes you have to stand up for what is right. The majority of people are decent and wholeheartedly appreciate all of our care workers- I’m not a USA citizen but am a retired nurse, I know what it means to be able to help your fellow citizens. You do not deserve those awful comments, keep up the good work, the world needs people like you who genuinely care about others and not just themselves ."
