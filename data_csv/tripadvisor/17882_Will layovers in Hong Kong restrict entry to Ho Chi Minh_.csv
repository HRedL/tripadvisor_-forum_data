"Hi there,I have a trip to Vietnam planned for mid-March and so far am still planning on travelling despite the CoV-2019 outbreak. One catch, the original trip I had planned was to China, so the flight I have booked flies from Toronto to Hong Kong, where I am planning to then catch a flight to Ho Chi Minh.My question is - do you think there is a risk of being restricted entry into Vietnam with a flight that ostensibly has a layover in Hong Kong (I won't be leaving the airport)? At the moment I have been told by the rewards company I booked the flight from that they are not refunding flights to Hong Kong.Many thanks for your help!Em"
My question is - do you think there is a risk of being restricted entry into Vietnam with a flight that ostensibly has a layover in Hong Kong=======================================How can anyone predict what an epidemic or pandemic will do and how govts will react to it?
"Vietnam blocked all flights from China then backtracked as regards Hong Kong, so flights to/from there restarted. Some airlines reduced the number of flights anyway, presumably due to recuced demand.Who knows what the situation will be by the time you fly."
"I do not know about HK flights, but, if it can appease you, 9 cases in Vietnam as of today, including 4 Vietnamese. Out of the 9, 8 were on the same flight originated from Wuhan, and this out of 97 million people + tens of thousands of Occidental tourists. One of the Vietnamese is from a province west of Hanoi and is taken care of in a Hanoi hospital ; no case in Hanoi itself. Besides, all flights between China and Vietnam are banned since 1 February. The risk is extremely minimal in the country.Edited: 2:48 am, February 04, 2020 "
"I also have a layover in HK on the way to Hanoi, extra below from Cathay website, should be ok at the momentHo Chi Minh City (SGN)Passengers who meet the following criteria are not permitted to enter Ho Chi Minh City:Travelling on a People’s Republic of China passport with a visa on arrival approval letter.Travelling on any other passport with a visa on arrival approval letter, and has visited Mainland China in the past 14 days.Hanoi (HAN) & Da Nang (DAD)Passengers who meet the following criteria are not permitted to enter Hanoi or Da Nang:Travelling on a People’s Republic of China passport with a visa on arrival approval letter or a Tourist visa (DL).APEC card holders must present an invitation letter from their company / business partners in Vietnam to prove the purpose for their visit is business, not leisure."
At the moment you are okay but if it gets any worse in HK they will stop flights from there. Hopefully it will all settle down but you are just going to have to watch the situation.
