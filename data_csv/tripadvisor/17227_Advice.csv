Your guess is as good as mine and that is what it is - a guess.
"The buzzword is ""unprecedented"". Nobody knows. I would wait it out and let the airlines and condo owner cancel. If you cancel on your terms, you will probably lose your money. Contact the airlines and condo owner and see what they say."
We’re booked for the week after the 4th. Just going to let it play out and see what happens.
Do you think someone here will actually have an answer to on when this epidemic will be over? Your guess is as good as anyone else’s.
"You’re NEVER going to get the truth because they hide it. Last year they covered up the fact that they missed hurricane Michael category five hurricane by about a quarter of a mile if less the rest of our county we are all the same county separated by one little bridge was wiped out by category five hurricane October 10, 2018 the damages were above and beyond anything since 1939 but they did not want to tell the tourists that, they want to arisen dollars they did not know or care that the tourists were coming to this town that was still on his hands and knees in destruction and it still is, we are eat up with COVID-19 we just got testing in Panama City Florida about two weeks ago sofar- The last I checked we had 35,000 cases of Covid virus on Panama City Beach is the central location bringing Torrez to my town right now will be like packing in 500 crew ships and a panama city beach in Panama City Florida and we don’t want you here this is our home I understand you want to vacation I understand you have fun that you have this phone and you had this vacation because this is our home here around those are our beaches year-round I am at Florida native tourism has gotten out of control Panama City Beach municipalities the tourist development Council and the businesses and the condominiums that have piled up side-by-side on Panama City Beach in a little bit a 9mi stretch Cannot take care of any of us much less tourists if you all come barreling down to be on the golf of Mexico because you want to believe Mike Thomas the mayor who freaks out and will not shut down for a hurricane or anything else because of his money or the TDC they will bring you into danger because they want your money there will be deaths you will spread COVID-19 you vacation on top of us while we were having hurricane disaster we were a declared disaster zone in Bay County Florida and TDC was running advertisements to bring tourism down and people who were working and serving the tourist industry did not even have homes to live in we do not have full self so phone service yet we don’t want you here. cannot take care of any of us much less tourists if you all came barreling down to be on the golf of Mexico because you want to believe Mike Thomas the mayor who freaks out and will not shut down for a hurricane or anything else because of his money or the TTC they will bring you into danger because they want your money there will be deaths you will spread Covid 19 you vacation on top of us while we were having hurricane disaster we were a declared disaster zone in Bay County Florida and TTC was running advertisements to bring tourism down and people who were working and serving the tourist industry did not even have homes to live in we do not have a cell for some phone service yet we don’t want you here because because this is our home year-round it so happens to be we get to live here and vacation here anytime we want to but you’re going to have to stay home and wait you don’t want us bringing Covid 19 on top of you if you ended up with a major tornado or a major ice storm outage you would not want Atlanta Georgia advertising to come on down and visit while you were on your hands and knees and bacteria in your natural water in Panama City Beach is a mess and our law-enforcement and I municipalities and the tourist development Council and Mike Thomas the nail mayor he will not protect you he will not keep you safe both of our hospitals were beat to hell after hurricane Michael and they let you all come down last year.

Not a single punctuation was used above.
"Kinda felt like I was back in college, trying to read James Joyce ""Ulysses"" - appreciate the sentiments, but hard to read"
"speak into a cell phone on a microphone after you have survived a category five hurricane for 18 months 25 general contractors you have no idea that’s the point stay out of our town, and Verizon is messed up it will repeat everything and that is what you take away from what I had to say thank you for it go back, like a high school teacher and correct my punctuation and then put meaning and understanding to what I am speaking to in a microphone after living in A presidential he declared disaster zone for nearly a year and then eight months after that with no Internet service half the time and no Wi-Fi and no cell phone service that’s my point. This town is in no condition to take on more people. I deliberately used the microphone again. Live on a cellphone with bad coverage for insurance, food, surval 18 months & see how well your tired hands work. The point is -We’re in no shape to have you here. OBVIOUSLY 10 new cases overnight- Testing has only begun in CAT 5 Bay County- The beaches & tourism won’t tell you that. It’s not safe. Don’t come. Especially aince you have know knowles of the culture and destruction to where you’re wanting to come in the padt 18 months anyway."
"It’s the truth. Of course they want to hide it. And you’re not a fair “trip advisor” to allow that. Bought and paid off by the PCB Tousist Developement Counil, Chamber of commerce and who knows who else."
"Stacey,I own a condo on the beach and Live there half a year. PCB is just fine for tourists. Panama City Proper and the surrounding areas are unfortunately still recovering. But most tourists do not travel there. With that being said, it is correct to stay away from PCB until the Governor opens the state back up For tourism and it is safe. Staying away from Panama City Beach because of the hurricane is 100% untrue and your incoherent ramblings about it could not be farther from the truth."
