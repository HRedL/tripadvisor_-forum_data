Hey we are travelling in from ireland for labour day weekend to big bear as anyone any idea what does be on. We are also looking for the best place to rent a cabin for a party of 12 a mix between adults and children. If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it.
It's pretty early to be planning a trip from outside the US. The restrictions on domestic activities will have to have been lifted well before they think about allowing foreigners in again.
"After the virus has run its course, been defeated or whatever, then the economy will have to get well. Make all the plans you like but do not put down any money that’s not fully refundable. And don’t get your hopes too high."
"Did you ever get any real responses? We are also looking for Labor Day weekend, multiple families? I’d appreciate any input you may have gotten. Thanks"
"Here is a real response.If you are planning to do it this year, 2020, you can stop!Trump thought the Covid-19 will ""quietly disappeared"" in the summer, back in March 2020. We are in end of July now, the reality: the Covid-19 cases (and deaths) have accelerated more than any of the previous months."
I don’t think you can come to America in September this year. You might be able to come later in the year though. I came over here back in March and have been here since then.
"It seems unlikely that the ban on travelers from Ireland will be lifted by Labor Day, so ChrisO probably cannot come, even if he still wants to. For Pfraiman, there's no travel ban from the Dominican Republic, but even assuming you can get flights, you can't really have a multi-family gathering unless you're willing to do it from a distance. The health orders require that you stay 6 feet from everyone you don't live with and that you wear a mask. That's not going to change before September.Labor Day weekend in Big Bear is always very crowded. This year seems like a particularly bad one to try to have a gathering there."
Sometimes I wonder if Trump doesn't have Covid himself. He's a shrewd businessman and stupid is the only thing that comes out of his mouth ButHis job is international affairsGovernor's are National. I believe that's why he gave the inept all that money for our health.Here's some money. Let's shutdown the State governments and get paid while we're doing it. That's California leadership for you.
