Vis a vis the Coronavirus scare is it advisable to travel to Bhutan in the 3rd week of February. As I see it seems safe but would I have to go through quarantine on my return to India ??
A patient tested for Coronavirus in Bhutan was found to be negative. There are no confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Bhutan.Remember that if you are an otherwise healthy person Coronavirus is a relatively mild disease. It's mainly a problem for people who have weak immune systems. There is a lot of misinformation around about the virus.
"Your question about your return to India should be asked in India, as there the rules might be different.This article describes the situation in Bhutan for now:https:/…For a virus, three weeks is a very long time. See closer to your departure what happens in the world and specifically in India.If you have any official information, please let us know here. Thank you."
"hello, we have scheduled a trip to Buthan on the 2nd week of March and paid all the fees. Now we are scared to go to Buthan and on teh way back we will go through Banghong airport for our last destination İstanbul.any suggestions?"
"Your best source for information is your Bhutanese agent.Otherwise you can ask your local health officials about the rules when you return Some might ask for a quarantine period if you return from Thailand. If you stay only in transit in Bangkok, for the moment there are no rules like that..See what the situation is closer to your dates, as things can change."
"Hi, Can you please update about your visit to bhutan and your return back to india. Is there any scare for corona virus in Bhutan. I am traveling in first week of April. Thanks in advance"
I am planning a trip to Bhutan from around March 21 to June 8 where I will be doing volunteer work for the government. I plan on transiting through Narita Airport (Tokyo) and Bangkok where I will spend 2 nights at an airport transit hotel. Should I be concerned about the coronavirus both while traveling to Bhutan and also during the time I will be in Bhutan?
"To poster nr 6:the best source of information is the government institution you are going to work with.Things change fast, sometimes several times per day.No way to know now about 21 March, we even don't know what will happen tomorrow.For now Japan and Thailand are on the list of countries where you need a quarantine period if you have been there. Your airline has the power to change your route, but will do this much closer to your date.Good luck."
Yes
"There is not even a single case so far in Bhutan. All our entry points are being monitored by health officials. If you are coming from a affected country then you must go through quarantine for 14 days. For the country you will be entering after Bhutan, it is best to find out from there.Cheers!"
"Hello I'm having a planned trip to Bhutan from March 21st to 27th March 2020. My family and friends denying to visit Bhutan due to situations of Coronavirus news. It's my humble request to all Bhutanist tour operator please help me to provide the realtime news or updates. My eVisa already approved. I'm having also question that is it going to allow me to get entry from Bagdogra airport to phuentsholing? Do I have to go through any medical checkups or need to bring any medical reports?Edited: 10:05 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…Dear All,There is now a confirmed case in Bhutan as per the attached post. Since you have e-permit, you should have an agency to help you apply for E-permit. Check with your agency on updates."
"It seems from reports that Bhutan is not allowing tourists in for the next 2 weeks.If you are travelling to Bhutan soon, please advise us if you are allowed to enter Bhutan."
"HI Manthan,I am also planning to travel in 2nd week of April, with same route. I am also concerned about this news. as per latest news there is 1 case found in Bhutan about this virus. What i am thinking, instead of cancelling trip now, lets wait for few more days and check latest status.What are your plan buddy ?"
All flights to Bhutan from Delhi cancelled from tomorrow (07/03/2020) This from a friend who was to travel tomorrow!Locals can confirm this ? Reason.
One case just detected on 2nd March. That was the first one. Ideally I would advise not to travel as also Bhutan has very limited care centre and doubt if they are equipped to handle this challenge
Please cancell your travel plans. I am just back from Bhutan. On 2nd March the first positive case has been recorded. Even if it safe you may need to go through a long procedure of screening when you return back in India.
Hi ...my travel dates are the same. I got to know today that they might deny entry to tourist.
"No entry for all tourists for the next two weeks.If more cases are detected, this rule might be extended, just read the news. as things evolve fast."
"Bhutan bans tourists after first case: On Friday (6th March) Bhutan has banned the entry of tourists for two weeks after it confirmed its first case of the coronavirus.I am in Bhutan right now as a tourist, let me know if you need any info"
Could you share me your contact info?I have travel plan on 21st
"Hi, I got an update from an agent that entry to Bhutan is shut for the next 2 weeks. Now I am not sure about anything. I will be travelling to Bhutan in the first week of April. If you get any update about anything please let me know. Thanks."
"Yeah sure , daily i m discussing the situation wit my tour operator. He is bhutanist and getting updates.Stay in touch via email too incase i m not active heremanthanptel@gmail.com"
Sure thanks.
We are also have a plan to go in may 17 from Ahmedabad..to Paro ..so now what to do??
Hello....2day it's 11 March so u have continued with your plan or u cancelled??? If u are there in Bhutan then what's current situation??? waiting for reply...
"Hi Jinal , as per latest update from my Bhutanist tour operator to wait till 16th March. Till now no incoming tourist entry allowed. My journey date starts at 21st.I will update you on 16th march once I hear back from my tour operator."
"@Jinal G, as you know that this requires very careful decision on the ground realities, life of the people, economy etc there is no news as of today on lifting of restriction or continuing with this. You need to wait until further notice. I'm sure you can understand this.By HBT"
"I can offer no insight into Bhutan but if you are watching the news increasingly countries are tightening their borders. Israel, Thailand, Kuwait, India, Argentina have all announced significant restrictions on entry to their countries in the last couple of days. Kuwait has gone so far as to ban all commercial air service in and out of country starting Friday. At this point my money is on international travel getting more complicated and tourist bans/limits becoming more widespread. So anybody with near-term travel should expect complications."
"Hi, I called Goibibo today to enquire about my hotel bookings they said even Indians are not allowed to go out of the country before 14th April? I mean it is so confusing. I asked them that the Indian Government had banned foreign tourist from entering but had not banned Indians to go out. They said if you go out you have to come back to the country as well right? I mean it was a very weired explanation. Do you have any idea?"
"Hi DebolinaPlease follow this thread for Bhutan visit. This thread is official announcement from Bhutan tour councilhttps:/…update-covid-19-notificationAbove thread is 100% legit , they update it everyday if there is any update about upcoming tourist or visitors"
