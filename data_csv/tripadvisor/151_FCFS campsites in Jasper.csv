"Hi all, I have yet another question! We want to try and get in on a first come first serve campsite for some of our time in Jasper. Does anyone have any tips or experiences with them? Are they difficult to get? Are there any of them that are particularly hard to get in, or any that are less busy?We will be in Jasper/ Banff from July 20th to July 26th. We will have a camper van. THANK YOU!!"
Angel - you may want to look at this thread https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g659487…
"At this time, all first come, first serve campgrounds in Jasper are closed. I believe that will be the case all summer.You can see at this link that they have all had their operating dates scratched out:https:/…campingEdited: 6:28 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"So far, only two campgrounds are opening in Jasper National Park, and to existing reservations only. If I am understanding the information correctly, camping will be only by reservation; there won't be any FCFS camping this year. ""Camping will begin with existing reservations. A reservation is required to camp at a Parks Canada place. We will gradually start accepting new online reservations for some campgrounds over the coming weeks."""
"New reservations start June 25 for Jasper and June 26 for Banff. This is for the campsites listed as open by Parks Canada, none of the FCFS are scheduled to be open at any time so far."
@essba I'd be very curious to know the source of that information (the dates for the new reservations). I couldn't find this information anywhere myself. Thank you! :)
"Right from the horses mouth, Parks Canada!Jasper (under ""Camping during Covid-19"")https:/…covid-19-infoBanff (under ""Camping during Covid-19"")https:/…covid-19-infoThere are so many Parks Canada pages for each park, camping info, covid info, etc. It's hard to know where to look to find all the current info!"
"@JeffQc, it's on the Parks Canada reservation website - click on the yellow banner at the top of the page : https://reservation.pc.gc.ca/"
"Guess I should also add that backcountry camping reservations open on June 24, in case anyone is looking for that."
Thanks guys! The information can get confusing on the multiple pages of Parks Canada website...! I feel like the information is also changing my the minute!
Thanks everyone!! What about Pyramid Lake in Wells Gray Park. I *THINK* it will be open?
"Check the Wells Gray PP website for more information. I note that Pyramid CG in WGPP is not on the BC Parks campground reservation system, so I assume it's FCFS. (Note that Pyramid CG in WGPP is not the same place as Pyramid Lake in Jasper National Park - WGPP is four hours away from Jasper. See map here: https://goo.gl/maps/BR4msKJmoopVMc5T8 )"
