"We're scheduled to leave in 1 month for Las Terrenas. We're bringing along our young daughter, and my parents. They have enough health problems that i don't want to spend our vacation worrying about them getting sick. Can anyone tell me how Chikungunya is affecting the area right now?"
"Chikungunya is affecting the whole Island/most of the Caribbean since it started, no change on that.you anyways need to protect yourself from Mosquito Bites, as the fairly new Chikungunya is not the worst of the numerous things passed on by Mozzies. Dengue is old and also Islandwide present.Mike"
"I have heard of no new cases it in the Samana Peninsula for several weeks. As Mike rightly says, use a DEET based repellent, light mosquito coils and bring some loose cool long sleeves ops and trousers. AND HAVE FUN! you are coming to one of the most beautiful areas in the DR"
Any updates on this? I'm planning a trip to Las Terrenas in March but concerned about the risk of Chikungunya... Is it still prevalent?
Just wondering if you went on your trip? We are planning to visit Samana (Hotel Sublime Samana) later this month and worried about Dengue and Chikungunya. Many thanks.
still no new updates. It is not as severe as when it first appeared throughout the Caribbean. Use sensible precautions as detailed in my earlier comment and you should be fine
Just so you are aware Chikungunya has been found as far north as Florida and even into some other southern states. It will not go away as it is spread my mosquito bites.
Been looking online and it looks like the worst is over and DR has been declared Chikungunya freehttp://www.kairifm.org/?p=229#!Dominica-has-been-declared-Chikungunya-free/cs6y/AC902D7C-A125-4F0F-90AD-607983C8F07EEdited: 4 years ago

Dustyjoe very interesting read thanks for the link.Steve
"The Dominican Republic has not been declared Chikungunya free, it is Dominica that has been declared Chikungunya free according to that article, which is a totally different island. It states "" The frequency of new cases appears to be tapering now that over 5% of the population has been infected. The population difference is one reason it will take the Dominican Republic longer than Dominica to declare an end to its epidemic "".Angie."
"Opps, Its not the first time i confused the two Sorry :/"
