just need some anxiety reassurance. I am assuming the city is still welcoming and safe to visit....!
"As of right now, there are six diagnosed cases of Covid -19 in the entire State of Illinois. See this article from the Chicago Tribune, https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c… Next week, who knows?"
"@Albert: Good morning or in your case good afternoon to you. As @mba mentioned who knows what might happen next week in terms of the coronavirus BUT I don't know if you meant that when you asked if it's safe to visit. Let me put it bluntly, as long your airline haven't cancelled your flight to ORD by next week you will enjoy flying 40,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean to get here and have a nice time, in terms of safety as long you spend your time in downtown Chicago and the surrounding area you'll be fine, does crime happens in Chicago? Of course but there is usually a big police presence downtown but random acts do happen unfortunately so IMHO if you act like a resident of Chicago you should be perfectly fine (be aware of your surroundings, don't flash your smart phone in public, kinda know where you're going, watch your passport, stuff like that).If you have any other ?'s do ask, enjoy your visit to the Windy City!"
"Assuming you're asking about coronavirus, if you are traveling in coach class, I should think the greatest coronavirus risk will be your flights, cooped up for 8 hours in close proximity to strangers from who-knows-where and the recirculated air in the cabin.  I have seen advice to use antiseptic wipes to clean your seat (unless it is cloth upholstery), tray table, touch screen and anything else your hands may come in contact with. But, as mentioned, the situation is rapidly evolving, so nobody knows what it will be like next week."
Business as usual today. No clue what it will be like next week. Coronavirus has hit the public schools so who knows.
"to answer your question, yes, the city is safe and welcoming-see you next week-we look forward to your visit!"
It would be better if you gave us a subject for your question but Chicago is always safe and welcoming. Enjoy your visit to our great city.
"Chicago is open for business. Wear your winter gloves all the time tho so you are protected on the subways, holding on to railing, pressing elevator buttons, etc."
"Hi, yes this was specifically wrt coronavirus."
You're more likely to get a virus in the enclosed airplane that recirculates it's air than in this city.
Chicago is always welcoming! You´ll love this city.
"Everything is functioning as usual in Chicago -- but of course since the US is not testing for the virus we really have no idea how widespread it is. It doesn't appear to be a big issue here yet -- We have tickets for Paris, Friends have tickets for London -- we are both trying to decide -- the travel itself is the most worrisome i.e. being on a plane with a typhoid Mary for 9 hours."
"My fear would also be if you do get sick, do you want to be out of the country? You would have to be in a Parisian hospital, would insurance work there? Could you get back in the US easily? It's all so crazy.Edited: 5:22 am, March 11, 2020 "
Coronavirus downtown: COVID-19 case at Prudential Plaza. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"The President announced tonight that he is ordering a suspension of all flights originating in Europe. You had better verify your flight ASAP. It’s not so much as a Chicago problem but a national/ international one.Edited: 10:09 pm, March 11, 2020 "
travel from the UK isn’t included in the ban but in your shoes I’d be rethinking the visit regardless.
"Chicago is banning gatherings of over 1000; that puts theatres, concerts and conventions out of bounds. TheNational hockey, basketball leagues have cancelled their seasons and baseball has announced delayed opening of theIr season. The Lincoln Park Zoo is closing until mid-April. Personally, I wouldn’t put myself in an airplane. (#11)What will be open will be open. We have no idea anymore."
"In Illinois it is predicted a huge outbreak will happen in four weeks. Schools closed. No more mass on Sundays. But crowds are huge at the grocery stores. Shelves are being emptied, Diapers, bread, soups, water are gone already in stores we went to. We are actually heading to Menards or Home Depot. Supermarkets are overflowing at the moment."
"Sorry Anna, it is happening now. Here as in the U.K. Even Sponge Don Square Head announced today that he’s rethinking his U.K. travel exemption."
"Perhaps with the closures of the Shedd Aquarium, theatres, etc. it may be best to chose another date. I just saw a news feed that says President Trump is now considering a travel ban on the United Kingdom as well. Stay tuned."
UK and Ireland have been added to the travel ban.
That does it! We're going out for lunch today. Enough of this sequestering.
I hope your visit was all that you expected! Right about the time of your leaving Chicago things began to get really crazy. I hope you didn't get caught up in that.A friendly Chicagoan.

"A one post wonder. Availiam, Albert (from March 7) said he was coming ""next week"". That would be when the effluence hit the fan here and the UK. UK was added to the international travel ban on March 14. The UK announced no non-essential international travel March 17. The city was already on alert (St. Patrick's Day fun was cancelled) and stay-at-home orders from the State began March 20. Hopefully, Albert never made it here. If, by some miracle, he did, he found a ghost town.Edited: 12:44 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"I am surposed to fly 2nd may to chicago from london,flight have not yet been cancelled with AA so playing it by ear"
Don't come. Everything is closed. You won't find anything to do here.
"@ June M,Unless this is a business trip, don't come. Reschedule your trip. The stay at home order which is in place until May 1st is likely to be extended, although there may be some modifications which I, for one, expect to be minor. As of now, no restaurants are open for eat-in dining, so you would have to buy take-out or delivery and eat in your hotel room or rental. There are no open museums, concerts, movies, theater, boat tours, zoo, shops or anything in the way of tourism-related activities. Even Millennium Park, the RiverWalk, the 606 and the lakefront are off-limits. Store windows are boarded-up along Michigan Ave."
"June, There is no reason to visit Chicago now. The city is closed. reschedule for next year."
"Too soon to visit. We will still be closed down.But wait a bit to see if the flight gets cancelled, so that you aren’t the one cancelling it. But no matter what, don’t come.Edited: 12:46 pm, April 20, 2020 "
You don't want to get stuck here for a few weeks if the U.S or UK cancels international flights for a time period again.
To be honest it’s best no one travels in or out of the uk at the moment.
Welcome to TA welltraveled. First) the post is from March 7 regarding travel on or around March 14. It is now April 30th. Second). Choose a different name. NEVER put your email on an international forum. Actually never put your email on any social media.
"""To be honest it’s best no one travels in or out of the uk at the moment.""Or anywhere from U.S to Europe/Asia/South America/Oceania etc"
