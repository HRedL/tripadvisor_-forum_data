"Hi everyone.We are a young family of 4, and like many if you, we’ve decided to cancel / delay our trip to Japan / South Korea. We were scheduled to go during Aussie school holidays in April, and will most likely need to delay til September/October Holidays.Do you all think it will have settled and be safe to travel by then?"
"Nobody really knows at this point. Just wait and see if things get better or worse in the next couple months before you make travel plans again.Edited: 3:53 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Professionals have no clue, how are strangers on a travel forum supposed to know?Monitor the situation yourself"
"I'm also trying to figure that out and feeling very stuck. I don't plan to make any nonrefundable reservations until it feels safer. But I'm not feeling any urgency about taking a vacation, and I know I don't want to be on a crowded plane just now."
I personally think there will be one or 2 effective drug(s) against the Covid-19 virus before Summer or even earlier. since several clinical trials are going on now in Japan and other counties. And I think Japanese Government will be the first to allow such drug because of Tokyo Olympic 2020.
I agree with Post #1 & 2 ... no one on this forum really knows what will happen. It’s just people guessing and a lot of outlandish wishful thinking at this point.
"Don't expect us to be irresponsible prophets.Could you imagine that the Governor of California would declare State of Emergency on March 4th last week?https:/…Well, I thought they weren't doing enough PCR tests yet."

"There are other non covid-19 risks that could cause issues even in your home country.You are in Australia - community transmission has already started in your country so it is a disease that is ""in the wild"" so staying home is similar to travelling. You might get any one of a dozen other diseases travelling, covid-19 is just one of those. You are still more likely to die of common flu that covid-19 at the moment."
@JapanCustomTours you sound like someone who runs a travel agency.of course travelling and staying at home is not the same and your last statement is not based on any facts.
"#9 - even the WHO doesn't advise against travelling if you're healthy and not in high-risk group. The virus is widespread, you might get in anywhere at this point."
"If you are coming to Japan from China and South Korea (no matter what nationality), you will be quarantined at a designated facility for 2 weeks after your arrival. Also, all flights from those 2 countries will only land at Narita or Kansai. A friend who was coming last week cancelled her trip because the company she works for made a new policy in which people who have traveled to China, South Korea, Japan and Italy have to do ""self quarantine"" for 2 weeks (no pay) before returning to work. She couldn't afford to take 4 weeks worth of ""vacation.""Better check to see what's the latest with your country's and your work's policies."
"I have a trip planned end of March/beginning of April (haven't cancelled yet, though airline is offering refunds). I'm considering rebooking for June, but as someone advised me, get an insurance plan that offers a Cancel for Any Reason coverage. That way if June rolls around and things still don't look good, I. can at least recoup some of my money back (if airline or hotels don't offer full refund). Of course, then you're out the premium for the insurance plan, but compared to overall cost of the trip, I'd say it's worth looking into."
"That’s interesting! We are flying from Australia to Japan and then onto South Korea and back. Our Government says we have to self quarantine after travelling from South Korea, but they haven’t mentioned Japan yet.Our travel agent says our airline (JAL) still hasn’t released a ban or anything so unfortunately we’re still loosing our money if we cancel.We’re just trying to change our flights instead of cancelling because we would loose our accomodation as well if we don’t reschedule. They won’t refund either!"
Such a lazy and unoriginal post.Please delete.
Pretty sure you will have trouble getting back into Australia if you are coming from South Korea.

"Kat @#12, yes, the friend is from the US. She lives in Colorado. Her 3 friends were also coming to go skiing in Hakuba (only 1 day in Tokyo). The companies of the 3 other friends didn't have such a plan implemented, but they didn't want to take any chances should such a policy suddenly pop up within the 2 weeks they were in Japan. I understand their dilemma."
"＃１１The Health Minister of Japan said it was a REQUEST to self quarantine at your home if you were Japanese and if you were coming from another country, it would be your hotel. The government are not preparing any facility to quarantine the people coming from China or South Korea."

"So.... the Japanese government says EVERYONE who is coming from China or South Korea will have a 2 week quarantine at a place where they have ""designated"" --- ie, home for Japanese, and hotels for tourists. Don't take public transportation. I guess that means your private car or..... taxi??? I must say it's terribly confusing. How will someone who is ""quarantined"" at a hotel for 2 weeks eat? Technically, they are not supposed to leave the room. Room service, but please leave the food at the door? That's going to be awfully expensive. Can't go down (or up) to the restaurant, can they? What if the hotel is a small business hotel with no restaurant? Can they go to the corner combini? And the ""trip"" to ""see Japan"" won't start for 2 weeks AFTER entering the country! Will the Japanese who are going ""home"" stop by the supermarket on the way home to stock up on food for 2 weeks? Hmmm..... There was a case recently about a man who was tested positive and was asked to stay home until a hospital room was ready.... and he went our to eat/drink, telling everyone he was infected! So much for ""requesting"" people to stay home!Edited: 8:49 am, March 06, 2020 "
The latest info.... which doesn't answer anything! https:/…
"Well, it's just a request without any enforcement or penalty. They just want to scare the people out and show other countries that we are blocking the more infectious countries--a pose.Two weeks ago, I saw many Chinese and some Koreans but today I guess I only saw one pair of Chinese tourists around Ueno. The number is decreasing seriously already.Edited: 8:58 am, March 06, 2020 "
"You are very right that ""community transmission"" is happening in many places across the globe, but that does not mean that you might as well travel, because travel is the same as staying home. In our city people are taking ""staying home"" very seriously - schools are closed, the university is closed, libraries and churches are closed, community events over 50 people have all been cancelled, businesses are sending employees home, everyone who can is working from home... If we all really STAY HOME then this pandemic will peter out before it kills millions of people in places which don't have adequate health-care in place to keep the death rate down to just 3% - 6%..."
"Tough to say at this point when it will be safe. Could be two months, could be six months. Could be longer."
"I think you may be struggling to get CFAR travel insurance right now. Apparently there are still some exclusions eg, pre-existing crises..."
"#1 Why are you posting this on Tripadvisor? How is anyone here qualified to know or answer this, especially right now?Humanity never ceases to disappoint."
"I think OP is stuck with non-refundable tickets that the airline is willing to change to a later date, but not a refund. So the question is when is a better time to change to. I was in that position briefly until my airline loosen their policy further when the situation in Asia got worse around late January.No one really know how this will play out in the next few months. Who would have known two weeks ago that US will ban travel from all of Europe, and that our schools will be closed. This virus is likely to spread to other countries that do not have this problem now, and they may implement their own travel ban. I expect we will see more of that in the next few weeks.If your airline is still not willing to refund. My suggestion is change it to as late a date as you can still travel to Japan. There is still no guarantee that the travel situation will be safe, but the airline may change their position before your new travel date and offers a refund."
"The outbreak in China appears now to be in its final stage. So, it might also take @3 months in other countries. So, it will be fine at least in Autumn IMO: Tokyo Olympic might be too early."
"I’m from the U.K and I’ve rebooked for October - I’m not getting my hopes up too high but I’m really hoping it will have settled by thenAbout 4 of my friends have rearrange various trips around the world (from Europe, to the US, to Hong Kong & Japan) and all of their travel agencies all recommended autumn time (October time) to be a safe option to travel again but who knows - it’s very unpredictable and different countries governments have very different ideas and policies regarding the virus Fingers crossed for you and your family ! Hope you have a wonderful trip whenever it may be :,)"
Don't book anything that you can't cancel or modify without substantial cost. Check your travel insurance coverage.Nobody knows when this will get better. It can be 3 months or a whole year.
I had travel planned for late April this year. I rebooked the flights and AirBnb to late October this year. Hoping and looking forward to being able to go then!
Stay home to flatten the curve till then!
""" I rebooked the flights and AirBnb to late October this year.""That's probably better than this month."
"It might be.. Delta waived change fee from April to Oct. Airbnb host just changed the dates, as I was lucky that the dates were available.Worst case is I'd have to pay Delta's change fee + overage (if applicable) and eat a portion of the AirBnb.. most of flight was paid with points so not an absolute cash loss. Fingers crossed that late Oct is ok to travel but if not, maybe fees/etc would be waived again.Thanks."

"I pushed mine back to september-oct at latest. As long as we are able to fly still and not on lockdown. Depressing that we can't go right now, but everyone's health and safety is important. All else fails, next year. Possibly. Guess my cherry blossom watch wasn't going to happen this year anyway."
"There are cherry blossoms after mid September like Jugatsuzakura and Fuyuzakura.Unless you seriouosly flatten the curve, Japan won't allow the US citizens' entry. Stay home to make it happen."
"That was only if the boarders are open. I'm hoping to next year if I can't this year. In the meantime, I'll just save what I can. I'm already doing self-isolation. Only going out for essentials and work and a light walk. I'm inside (by myself) everyday."

"The first week of June, 2020. It will be hot. But we will be there.Japan will lift the travel restrictions at the end of May. Just in time for our trip.Of course, I'm just another poster here on Tripadvisor and have no inside information. Just wishful thinking and hope, a fool's hope, as Gandalf said.Edited: 3:20 pm, April 24, 2020 "
I guess we all have wishful thinking right now. This crisis may be here until someone comes up with an effective vaccine.I myself changed my travel dates to October however I know very well I might have to even postpone that trip as well. However I postponed instead of asking fro refund simply because the airline need all the capital it can get to pay its own employees and avoid going bankrupt. I will postpone again if the airline gives me the option if the situation isn't any better in October. Also because when countries opens for tourism there are thousands of people in every country that needs tourism to survive. I want to spend money where I can to support those who are not as lucky as me (my job isnt very affected by this crisis).I hope everyone stay safe to and that we all at some point can go visit Japan and enjoy all her riches. I know I'm going to miss my annual spring trip to japan.
"Right now, we are requested not to travel to other prefectures even inside Japan. The number really need to decrease to reopen the borders. Let's stay home to make that happen."
