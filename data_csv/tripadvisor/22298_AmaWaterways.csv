"We were very surprised by AmaWaterway’s failure to make any flexibility around coronavirus impact on our planned cruise with them from Vietnam this week- including with my 92 year old father. We said we would happily reschedule, but all Ama has to say is that their cruise is safe (so far.)We had previously been impressed by their customer mindset, but no longer. Is this a typical approach in the industry, and how should we approach this issue?"
"Unless you have travel insurance which has ""cancel for any reason"", there's probably not a lot you can do until Vietnam closes it's doors to tourists or your country issues a travel warning about travelling to the countries you intend to visit.There are a couple of threads on this forum about Coronavirus etc which you may find of interest."
I would be very interested in how things turn out on your trip. We are due for a March 2nd Vietnam/Cambodia trip with AmaWaterways and are already contending with flight cancellations due to Cathay flight reductions because of the virus.
"Traveling with a 92 year old you surely have a Travel Protection Plan in place. If you booked with a travel agent then pose this question to them. A good point has been made by the last poster that you may not have your flights anymore. Did you buy your flights through AMA?You are right that they are acting oddly in this case. Would you please let us know how it turns out? Also, what is your departure date?"
I am surprised any of the river cruise companies are going ahead with cruises in that area but I see on AMA Uniworld & Avalon they are offering specials for Feb & March sailings sounds irresponsible to me under the circumstances with the virus situation
"I would suggest contacting AMA, as it seems as if tour companies are relying on TA's to get the info out. I found this on Travel Agent Central for Avalon (general Globus statement) : ""As a result of the recent coronavirus cases in China and the subsequent Chinese government-imposed closures to key tourist sites throughout the country, we are allowing any Globus family of brands guests with travel to mainland China that is scheduled through March 31, 2020, to re-book their vacation to an alternate date or destination in 2020 or 2021. The full value of their original China vacation (land portion) will be applied to the new one, although airfare changes may be required."" This is from the 25th of January, Some lines on the European rivers are starting to do health questionnaires prior to boarding, and will refuse boarding for anyone travelling through China.Priority for now would be to either contact the cruise line if you booked directly, or your TA.Edited: 3:05 pm, February 11, 2020 "
DONNThe OP is not going to China so do the rules still apply?
"It’s best for them to check with AMA or their TA. Every line will set its own “rules”, and only the actual line will give the proper answer.Edited: 6:02 pm, February 11, 2020 "
exactly
We depart on a AMA Charms of the Mekong cruise on March 2. We are also concerned about the coronavirus despite repeated reassurances from AMA that it is safe to go. We hope you have a safe and enjoyable trip. Could you please let us know how things go if you return home before February 27. Thank you.
"FYI for those with travel insurance - I've been informed that since the Coronavirus is a now ""known"" you are no longer eligible to use ""cancel for any reason"" insurance for it. I believe that those who purchased prior to Jan 2020 are grandfathered in. This is direct information from a travel insurance company when we were looking to add insurance for our upcoming May river cruise with AMA."
I am on the same cruise!

"I would love to hear from some current AmaWaterways Mekong passengers. I question how accurate the information on virus transmission in Cambodia is - they have been showing just 1 case for weeks now. Much of the March 2 cruise is in Cambodia.The ONLY communication from AmaWaterways, via our travel agent, was on February 4th and read: ""The health and wellbeing of our guests and crew are always our utmost priority. We are continuously monitoring the international travel bulletins regarding the coronavirus and are taking preventive measures as recommended by the health authorities. While we do not operate river cruises in China, the Vietnamese government is conducting health screenings of arriving travelers at all entry points. We are advising guests traveling with us in the next couple weeks that due to the additional special precautions that the Vietnamese government is taking, health screenings may take place on board ship and our guests may be required to fill out additional documents as they enter Vietnam. However, although these additional precautions may take a few extra minutes, they should not impact their AmaWaterways river cruise experience. We hope the circumstances will have improved somewhat by the time your group sails with us In March. Nevertheless as I mentioned above, we will continue to monitor the international travel bulletins and will inform our travel partners and/or guest of any updates/changes as they are made available to us. Please be assured and also communicate to your clients that we will continue to stay on top of the latest updates."""
I also found this article helpful:https://www.bestpricevn.com/travel-guide/art…
If you are going still I would be taking my own supply of N95 masks  updated caseshttps:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6
"Hi, Our Mekong cruise is on 03/30/2020, from Vietnam to Cambodia, flying from New York with Cathay, they just changed airports, from Newark to JFK, same schedule"
"While Amawaterways has yet to update their website, some of the other cruise lines have. They have basically said all is a go - provided you can get there I suppose. My own mindset is that I will wait until they cancel when I can get more or all of my costs back with my insurance. My cancelling so soon (Mar 12 Amsterdam to Basel) to the sailing date will mean my losing a great deal of money.I've been checking my flights too."
ROBINYou will probably be fine on the European cruise it is the ones in Asia Corona Virus still is going strong
"Things are getting worse as today , but so far no changes."
We leave in a 3 days for the AMA’s Charms of the Mekong Cruise. Did you enjoy the cruise. How are the conditions over there? Hope your 94 father fared well on the trip.
"Hi Jack,My trip (same like yours) will be on Mar 30th , so I would love to hear from your experience, and recommendations of courseThank you"
"Is there followup to your Vietnam trip? I think it should be over and you back home now, unless there was a flight issue. I am going on a European one in several weeks, and the reality by then will be that it would be impossible to 100% avoid being near a new hot spot. It would be nice to know how it is being handled by AMA in the Asian markets."
"Dear Ken,We sincerely apologize for the disruption the recent outbreak of coronavirus has caused to many of our guests' travel arrangements. In light of the recent global events and uncertainties around travel, we wish to offer our guests additional flexibility and peace of mind so they may continue to safeguard the wonderful plans they have made for their much-anticipated river cruise with AmaWaterways. As a result, we will offer for a limited time, special provisions which allow guests with new or existing reservations to purchase AmaWaterways Travel Waiver Plus* which provides cancellation for any reason with a future cruise credit covering cancellation penalties for services purchased through AmaWaterways. Effective immediately, guests wishing to add Travel Waiver Plus are no longer required to purchase AmaWaterways Cruise Protection Plan. For more information, please visit our website: https://www.amawaterways.com/travel-updatesYou are welcome to contact us directly at 800-626-0126 and speak with a supervisor. Please let us know if you have any questions."
"Alarming. They are putting their profits in front of their customers lives and health. We go on the Rhine trip in 3 weeks, they won’t offer a credit. I’m concerned about the long flights and this virus. Very concerning they are still cruising in Asia. Not very happy."
"If you are just three weeks out you should have your packet of plane tickets and more detailed itinerary descriptions now. I am later than you so have not gotten it yet. Is there any discussion of alternative arrangements if they have to reroute you somehow in your materials?Edited: 11:52 am, February 28, 2020 "
"""I’m concerned about the long flights and this virus. ""Surely you knew about the long flights before you booked the cruise ? Why are you bothered about the virus - it's already in the US. Everyone needs to get a sense of perspective - especially the 38% of Americans that are now reported to have stopped drinking Corona beer!"
"Dear Ken, Thank you for your patience - we appreciate your continued support. You can contact our reservations manager, JT Tellez, at 800-626-0126 and he will personally manage your concerns and bookings. Evan at AmaWaterways"
"Dear All, We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. The health and well-being of our guests and crew are always our utmost priority. Please contact our Reservations Manager, JT Tellez, at 800-626-0126 for more information. Thank you, Michelle at AmaWaterways"
All- just completed the cruise...no issues with coronavirus.
"AMA is now offering new travel waiver plus insurance. With this insurance, you can cancel for any reason. Information is on their website. If you have paid for your cruise on full, you have until March 15, 2020 to add it."
That certainly makes no sense if you have cancel for any reason.....in addition AMA sent a letter to my brothers travel agent when our questions began...if you get sick on the trip then your travel insurance will kick in...geez...how consoling.I have cancel for any reason...it certainly better be effective if I decide to cancel for april in holland.
Where are you sailing in May?
Please let us know how you make out with your Amsterdam to Basel cruise. Please detail what sanitation precautions they take on board and on the excursions. Also please let us know what precautions are in place at the ports in which you stop. I am booked on the same cruise in June. Thanks very much.
We are on a wine river cruise to Bordeaux on 3/19... I too am very disappointed to see how little if any information is on their site! We will lose a lot of We cancel so we wait each day as it gets closer (with great anxiety) to see if there is any news. I would think a cruise line like would be more responsive and committed to future guest!
"Dear kjspry, In light of this situation, we kindly ask that you contact your travel advisor, as we have been actively communicating with our advisors and travel partners in regards to COVID-19. If you have any questions, you may also reach out to us directly at 800-626-0126 to speak with a supervisor. Warm regards, From all of us at AmaWaterways"
"Ama is now offering passengers a policy for ""cancel for any reason"" and charging $175 per person, which has to be purchased by March 15. You will get a credit and a portion of cash back depending on how far in advance you cancel. Now the US State Department and medical experts are telling people not to go on cruises. Viking and Avalon are offering passengers the ability to cancel with not charge and they will give you a credit for a future cruise. Why isn't AMA doing the same as others with not additional charges?"
We have a river cruise booked for June.Ama will reschedule if you pay $350. Viking is rescheduling at no charge.We have trip insurance and it doesn't cover the virus.CDC recommends older people not put themselves at risk on cruise ships.
I can see AMA getting lawsuits very soon with their lack of refund offers and response to this very serious issue.I'm on Portugal/Spain in 3 weeks.
"I think it's clear that the pandemic is here and that the prudent traveler will have to cancel cruises and flights. CDC is telling people not to cruise right now, and not to fly if you're a senior or have compromised health. Everything about this pandemic is heartbreaking, but missing a cruise is not the worst thing in the world... We are scheduled on AMA Waterways Danube in September, so will keep an eye on things for now."
"AMA is one of the few cruise companies to not offer refunds now. They are offering a $175 What Me Worry insurance even if you've already paid. We should make a fuss ti get them to offer 100% refunds, especially for anyone over 60!"
I totally agree...it is insane considering it is unlikely any tours will likely be canceled. And now the WHO calls the situation pandemic. Where is their customer customer focus?!
We are supposed to be leaving in a week for a March 22nd Danube cruise that ends in Budapest. What concerns me now is that the # of cases in Germany is high in proportion to the population as per the WHO. I think that we'll get the insurance just in case.
"Cancel now. I'm in Seattle - epicenter. Governor just shut down ALL gatherings of over 250 people, will probably close schools in a couple days. Gatherings under 250 prohibited unless they meet strict social distancing standards. It's here and in Europe. You'll put yourself at risk on this cruise."

"I am shocked and appalled at the ""option"" being given to my parents and their group from AMA. This is a pandemic as declared by WHO -- the fact that this luxury cruise line is more focused on their bottom line than to acknowledge the severity of the situation is pitiful at best. Other cruise organizations, including Viking, are stepping up and providing high level customer service and AMA is far from that. I will never recommend this company to anyone."
"Well, now what am I supposed to do now that the US Government has banned travel to and from Europe for the next 30 days. We are supposed to do the Rhine cruise on April 12."
"I always though they were much better than Viking, however they refuse to cancel there European river cruises, even though the US has banned travel from Europe to USA. Viking has taken the imitative to stopped all their river cruises for 60 days because of the Corona Virus. Seems AmaWaterways cares only about money and not people. Next time we will choose Viking,"
"We too are booked April 4-12 Quaranteen time and they have not closed this trip! They must close this trip for us to get back my costly medical insurance coverage, needed for my age!Ama suppose to be this much better cruise line than Viking and yet they are making hard on their customersBooo Ama!Edited: 3:25 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Our travel agent just emailed us this Ama Waterways statement: Operations are being suspended for Europe and Mekong through April 25 and will resume on April 26th. (AmaCerto will start May 3)Guests will receive a 115% FCC on the entire vacation package; it is valid through December 31, 2022.If travel waiver was purchased, AmaWaterways will refund the premium.Thank you Ama for making this decision. Marti B"
"We would like to take this opportunity to inform you about the latest information regarding your upcoming river cruise with AmaWaterways. Your health and safety, and the wellbeing of our staff and crew, are of the utmost importance and we must be vigilant and responsible in ensuring your safety during these uncertain times. As a result of the recent travel restrictions, we are voluntarily suspending the operations of our European river cruise fleet and cancelling all of our Europe river cruises through April 25, 2020.With this in mind, we want to assure you that your long-awaited travel plans will be protected. We are therefore providing two options for you.1. Future Cruise Credit: We are offering you a Future Cruise Credit (FCC) equal to 115% of the value of your AmaWaterways purchased services, redeemable on any Europe or Mekong River sailing through December 31, 2022. 2. Full Monetary Refund: If you prefer, you may elect to instead receive a full monetary refund on all services purchased through AmaWaterways.Should you have any questions or concerns regarding your river cruise cancellation, FCC or refund, please contact your travel advisor as we are in direct communication with them regarding current developments on our policies. If you choose to contact us directly, please note we are experiencing a higher than normal call volume, as expected.We are disappointed that we are unable to fulfill your journey at this time, but we are confident that our ships will make a successful return to the rivers soon and hope to welcome you aboard one of AmaWaterways’ many future sailings.Thank you,From all of us at AmaWaterways"
Thank you so much! You did the right thing and a little slow but we are so grateful to be customer oriented!Because you took this we were able to role over our insurance coverage and credit for our payment. So very happy and will def. recommend Ama the best River Cruise companyBob F.
They cancelled our River Cruise and so very happy with them and this was last week! So not sure what your referencing? Call them or your travel agent!
We got our insurance credit back due to Ama cancelling and National travel ban by Trump!
"I like the Viking policy on this somewhat better: For those guests whose cruise falls within this window of suspended operations, Viking is offering the choice of a Future Cruise Voucher valued at 125% of all monies paid to Viking or a refund equal to the amount paid. Guests will have 24 months to use their Future Cruise Voucher to make a new reservation on any river, ocean or expedition cruise. For additional flexibility, if you are unable to use your voucher, Viking will automatically send you a refund equal to the original amount paid to Viking after the voucher expires. These Future Cruise Vouchers will also be fully transferable"
"We went thru Expedia cruise and worked with Lorissa who advocated hard to help us and she did, we got saved from your issues! Call her next time not this group! They also tried to get us to go with them but Lorssa so good!Good luck and nothing easy but sometimes need good luck!BestBob"
"We are scheduled on a European River Cruise May 1st and AmaWaterways representatives breezily say that they are still cruising! ARE YOU KIDDING? Viking and all other responsible companies have cancelled their cruises to Europe, period. The State Department has issued directives to not travel abroad while thousands of US citizens are quarantined or stranded overseas. Is this not enough? Delta has been gracious about flight changes as airports we would need to access have been closed down and we couldn't get there if we wanted to. So far, we have only been given the option of purchasing the additional trip insurance. I am most angry with their attitude and willingness to put people at risk especially with such a majority of passengers 65+."

"Well said zoeypearl.Edited: 6:22 pm, March 19, 2020 "
I think AMA are being optimistic or delusional that the virus situation will be over by May  I took China over 4 months before they have had a day with no new cases It is just ramping up here in North America
"AMA has now cancelled cruises through May (new post on their website as of 3/19 10pm). However, they are not issuing refunds, only future cruise credit (FCC). The FCC is attractive at 115%, but some people, for personal reasons, may not be able to reschedule. Please tell me I am reading it wrong."
BOB M That looks like what they are saying to meIf you are in the UK maybe the laws there are different & you can get a refundhttps://www.amawaterways.com/travel-updates
"Thanks. I am not in the UK, in the US. For the cruises AMA previously cancelled (those through April 25), they were offering FCC or FULL MONETARY REFUND. I printed out that policy. Now, for new cancellations through MAY, they are not offering FULL MONETARY REFUND, only FCC."
BOB MMaybe you can still get the full refund offer ?
"So this might be my last post for awhile. I hope it is. The point of my post is not asking for help in getting a refund, or asking what other readers have done or who they booked with. I am happy that others had a great experience and I hope they all have good experiences in the future. The point is to let readers know that in my opinion, AMA is not the outstanding company lots of people think they are. In this pandemic, AMA provided as one option for cancelled cruises through April 25 2020, 'full monetary refunds.' Those people are all happy they either get cruise credit or their money back. At the same time AMA offered others on future cruises, a chance to 'buy' travel protection plus which is nothing more than a change fee. A fee that almost every airline and cruise company is waiving. Many people paid this fee. We did. For the people that have cruises in May, the travel protection plus proved to be not necessary, a waste of money but a profit for AMA when last night AMA cancelled cruises through May. And to top it all off, AMA is not offering those people 'full monetary refunds' only cruise credit. Some people may never be able to use this credit. If you don't see the point of this post, I get it. It is confusing but the details are in the dates and timing and what AMA is doing. Good luck all and stay safe.Edited: 4:12 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"I agree with everything you say!We also have a planned cruise in May, and felt we had to purchase the travel insurance for $175 per person so we were protected. Now that they are cancelling the cruise, we should get a choice to get our money back or rebook PLUS get the $175 back. I am not impressed with this cruise company at all...other travel companies are waiving all cancellation fees. HORRIBLE!!!"
I agree - i purchased the $175 cancel for any reason insurance plus $1700 cancellation insurance from 2nd party - i think AMA SHOULD offer us a refund also - my trip was for May 24...this is very upsetting to me that we won’t be offered the same full refund..if we aren’’t interested to travel again for any reason...let’s let AMA know how we all feel.
I agree with above posters. I cannot believe we are not able to get a refund for our 4/30 Bordeaux Cruise that is cancelled!! We purchased the cancel for any reason insurance and they should refund that money as well.AMA is insured....why can't they give us our money back?
"I agree with the above. We need to get organized and let Rudi Schreiner know how upsetting this is at this time. From the AmaWaterways website: “We understand the immediate implications that these unavoidable travel cancellations are having on our valued travel advisors, who have been the foundation of our family owned and operated business. We recognise the important role they play in encouraging our guests to rebook therefore, paying commission now on the cancelled arrangements and again on the future bookings seems very much the right thing to do,” Schreiner said.  And the right thing to do for clients who paid for their trips in good faith?"
"The fact that AMA is not offering refunds is unconscionable especially compared to other cruise and tour operators. For those of us with cruises in June, they are saying we should purchase their insurance but we are only entitled to a future cruise credit which they will hang onto for up to 2 years before they will give you a refund of the original amount you paid even though they are offering FCC of 115%. Who knows if this company will even be in business in 2 years. Their approach to customer service is appalling."
"Absolutely pathetic. A group of us are scheduled for May 1. 2020 departure from Budapest. NOTHING FROM AMAWATERWAYS!!!!! Airlines, hotel and border crossings canceled and still nothing from AMAWATERWAYS. What gives? Doesn't make good for public relations!"
#72 Have you checked their website for the latest cancellationshttps://www.amawaterways.com/travel-updates
"You can’t get your money back for 2 years. The fine print gives you only a partial refund and the rest as a future cruise credit and you have to purchase their very “generous” special insurance. This is all nonsense and they just keep your money. If you want a full refund, you have to buy their special insurance, wait 2 years and then get your cash instead of the FCC. Read the terms carefully!"
"For any questions or concerns regarding your upcoming river cruise, kindly email social@amawaterways.com with your booking number and full name. We will review your inquiry with our reservations team and your travel advisor and get back to you as soon as we are able to. We appreciate your patience during this time."
"Not good enough FCC. I agree with the above. Who knows if I'll be alive to take your cruise or if you'll even be on business. Meanwhile, you've got my money for w years. DESPICABLE!!!!!!"
"Just a quick update on this topic for me. After 5 days, no response from Amawaterways by email to our request for a full refund. In fact, Amawaterways has NEVER contacted us to tell us our cruise was cancelled. We found that out by looking at the website. I reviewed the ticket contract information and I believe it states (not exact wording here) that if Amawaterways cancels the trip, they will refund all money paid."
BOB M See post #75 maybe contact them at the email provided
"I am very unhappy with Ama when I found out it is going to take up to 90 days for them to refund the cost of our cruise. With so many of us out of work because of the virus, holding our money for that length of time is unthinkable."
"On behalf of all of us at AmaWaterways, we want to assure you, our guests, that you are our utmost priority. We are monitoring the current situation daily and will inform you and your travel advisor of any changes that may arise to your future travel plans with AmaWaterways as soon as they are available. If you booked your river cruise with a travel advisor, we encourage you to reach out to them directly, as we are in close communication with them. We truly appreciate your patience during this time. Please email social@amawaterways.com with any additional questions regarding your cruise. Thank you."
"This post is directly for Amawaterways. We don't feel we are your priority. We were never informed by you or the travel advisor you cancelled our cruise although we knew it would be. We have requested a full refund from both you at the social email, and through our travel advisor, Avoya. The response from Avoya I consider less than professional. Avoya is not keeping us up to date on our refund status."
"Dear Bob, Thank you for reply and your feedback. After speaking to our reservations team, we were notified they have reached out to your travel advisor twice to advise of the current situation and options available. We apologize that you were not notified of the situation and will contact your travel advisor again so she can inform you at her earliest convenience. Please rest assured that we are doing our best to prioritize the needs of guests whose sailings are currently suspended and have escalated this to our reservation managers. Again, we sincerely apologize for any disappointment you experienced. We take your feedback seriously. Thank you for your patience at this time."
"My wife and I had booked a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia for the end of March for a land and river cruise and cancelled the trip at the end of February. AMA returned a full 50% of our overall expenses and credited us with the other 50% to be used within sixteen months. I will be in touch with AMA in the near future to see if they would consider extending the sixteen months period of time to rebook considering the present situation. We hope not to need the extension of a extended time frame, but would appreciate the extra time in the event we may need it."
"I thought that full payment for refund, was out. Credits only."
"We had a cruise scheduled for May 2, 2020, departing for a land package on 4/29 when AMA cancelled their schedule through 4/26. Being in our 70's and with my husband's health situation, we were obviously very concerned. In March, AMA offered purchase of a $350 non-refundable waiver which would allow penalties (over $7k) to be credited to a re-booking. The waiver was only offered thru 3/15. With no other apparent option, and not knowing if AMA would eventually cancel, in Mid-March we cancelled our May 2 cruise and re-booked for the following October. A few days later AMA cancelled their schedule thru end-May offering 115% towards a re-booking or refund (I see a comment from someone on March 26 waiting for their refund.) I don't know how far out they've gone since then, but they always seemed to be cutting it very close.Clients who purchased the waiver incurred cost of $350 + foregone 15%, in our case over $2,100. Because of their late response and short turnaround times, we felt we were were backed into a corner. When we raised our concerns, their reservation specialist responded that we took the best option ""at the time."" as we would risk penalties if we cancelled. As a gesture of goodwill they offered to raise our penalty credit by 15% , $531 pp. ,but would not refund the waiver and never offered a full refund.As the Corona situation unfolded, became more dire, and schedules were cancelled, AMA should have refunded the waiver and made the same offer to everyone scheduled for those dates. Instead, those who took action in March were unfairly penalized.AMA did not communicate in a timely or direct way, which is critical in this kind of situation. I found revised policies by going on their website and they would only speak directly with my agent.When we re-booked for October, it looked safe at the time, but experts are now saying that without a vaccine we could see multiple waves and a spike in infections in the fall. Given their track record, I have little confidence in how AMA will respond to traveler concerns, but I certainly don't want to be in a position of having to weigh risking our health and well-being against the risk of losing $7,400 in fees and penalties.In the U.S., federal agencies have mandated if a service is no longer offered or available, the consumer is entitled to a full refund. As AMA is not a U.S. company, not sure what recourse consumers have.Finally, I want to comment on Travel Insurance which provided absolutely no protection even if you had ""cancel for no reason"" , which for most policies only refunds 50% anyway. Also, I was told I could transfer the policy within a certain time frame. But, what if the trip is not taken? Why should I pay a premium for insurance when the company is not incurring any risk? If I sell my car, and cancel my car insurance, the company refunds the premium. Would be interested in how others faired, especially those scheduled for cruises in May."
"Ama canceled my June 10th cruise to Hungary. I took the refund and had to pay my travel agent 100 dollars for ad min.Edited: 7:56 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"I do not think the payment to the agent is unreasonable. In my past, I was in the travel business and it is not easy work. At this time, the business has changed and many agents work on additional charges to clients. Many cruises, tour companies and hotels pay less commission. An experienced travel agent should not have to do all the work for no payment.I hope you agree."
"Can someone explain what a ""worry free"" coupon is. On my invoice the penalty credits carried forward are designated a ""worry-free"" coupon. Does that mean I can use the coupon on a subsequent cruise if the trip I have booked for October is not ""worry-free""?"
"We purchased ""Cancel for any Reason"" insurance but it's not what you think. We had a cruise booked for April 24. On March 6 due to the virus, we were offered Ama's Travel Waiver Plus for an additional $160. When we questioned why our insurance didn't already covered they just said read the policy. We purchased on March 11. On March 12 they cancelled our cruise and offered full refund option. It's now been 33 days and we still have not received after many promises by Ama that if was in process. Our agent Pavlus has tried to help but no success. Ama has damaged their reputation on how they have handled this. We have had other trips cancelled due to the virus and have received refunds within days. Delta processed our refund credit to our credit card the same day."
"We purchased the waiver on March 10. If you remember, it was offered only thru the 15th. Although travel bans and border closures were implemented, they did not cancel our May 2nd cruise at that time.. Cancellations only went through the 26th. The waiver got us a a credit for penalty fees, but we were never offered a refund . The cost of the waiver was not included as they considered it nonrefundable. Insurance was worthless."
you received your refund?
"We cancelled our August cruise last Friday - before the 121 day cancellation mark. After what I read here, we figured we would rather lose the deposit (on 3 cabins) than sink more money into this trip. I have been so disappointed on how Ama has handled this worldwide pandemic. Ama wants me to give them more money (ie. Travel Waiver Plus) but there is no guarantee I would get a refund - only a future cruise credit. And it is a disgrace how they hold our money for an additional 90 days before we get the refund. I hope Ama is happy. Yes, they get to keep my deposit but we will NEVER cruise with them in the future!. And they will not be recommended by my AAA travel agent either."
"I am not impressed with how Amawaterways has handled this pandemic. I was booked to sail the Danube in May and then attend the Passion Plays. Most cruise lines had cancelled by the middle of March but Amawaterways was still 'sailing'. They were possibly the last. Unfortunately, I chose to cancel in March before that announcement was finally made so as not to incur more penalty. Ama's concession was to allow passengers, who had not paid the cancellation insurance, to purchase it at a cost of $175 in order to be eligible to cancel. This meant that I would receive a credit of 1/3 and a refund of 2/3. Sadly, they could not offer a full refund as I had cancelled before they did. Now, my credit is only good until March 2022. The Passion Plays are rescheduled to May 2022. Very poor customer service given the current circumstances. I feel that the offer of cancellation if the $175 was paid was a manipulation. I have asked my agent to request an extension of the expiry date but I doubt that Ama will comply. I will reluctantly use my credit, and not a penny more, next year. Never again!Edited: 2:05 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"I'm in a similar position. While most cruise lines simply offered a future cruise credit, with a price incentive, or a refund, AMA made clients pay a fee to cancel and re-book. Their timing was suspect as the offer of the waiver was short-term as they continued to insist they were sailing. The credit was for 50% of the cruise/land cost, with 50% refunded. The airfare was subject to $600pp cancellation fee."
"My agent was able to negotiate the expiry date to July 31, 2022. I await with bated breath to see this in print as I have not had any accurate paperwork for future credit thus far nor my refund to my credit card.I shall post once all is in place."
Good Luck!
Had a trip to Hungary in June and Ama refunded all monies. Not sure about the insurance I paid for.
"Our April 5, 2020 Rhine River cruise was cancelled by AMA.We chose a refund. As of today we have not received our refund ( credit back to our credit card).Has anyone in the same situation received their refund?"
I wanted to share that we now have a full refund of our cruise scheduled for April and the travel insurance $350 we purchased recently. I am very happy and somewhat relieved.
"Paul,That is great news for you! You must be relieved. ( I know I am a bit nervous about it. )How long was it between the time of cancellation and your refund?"
Cancelled 3/16 for a 4/11 cruise departure Porto River. Cruise would have ended 4/18. Money in our account 4/24. So about 5 weeks. I don't know if there's a correlation between the refunds being sent and the actual cruise dates.
Contacted AMA on March 10th. Was told that we had a choice: Pay an extra $350 and get half our money back (and half as a credit). or after March 15th there would be NO REFUNDS. So we paid $350 extra. On March 25th they issued a Cancellation of Cruise but refused to issue a full refund to us because we had agreed to their ultimatium. And now they have not even issued the half they promised after we paid the $350. Total RIP OFF. Will never use this Cruise Line again. A bunch of crooks as far as I can tell (like they did not know that in 7 days they were going to cancel the cruise..just another way to get an extra $350 from us without giving any refund)
"Dear Dave, We sincerely apologize for the disappointment you have encountered during the processing of your refund. At your convenience, kindly email social@amawaterways.com with your booking number and full name. We will review your inquiry with our reservations team and your travel advisor and get back to you as soon as we are able to. We appreciate your patience during this time."
"Since receiving ""apology"" from AmsWaterways"" I emailed them with the information they requested. That was On April 30, 2020. It is now May 25, 2020 and have still not heard from them or been issued any kind of refund. (Even the one they ""negotiated"" with me when I had to pay them an extra $350 to be allowed to receive half my money back and the other half as a credit on a near future trip that I have little chance of actually using. Have contracted my Credit Card company to try and resolve this issue, but it would have been nice, especially after apologizing in this forum if AmaWaterways had actually gotten back to me on this issue."
"Dear Dave, We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Our records do not show that we received an email from you on April 30th. When you have a moment, could you kindly forward the email you had sent to social@amawaterways.com? Please include your booking number and full name.

"My wife and I cancelled an AMA Danube river cruise on Feb.29, 2020, out of concern for the developing Coronavirus pandemic. We were within a 60 day window to be eligible for a partial refund and partial voucher for a future AMA cruise, after deduction of cancellation penalties. Less than 10 days later AMA itself cancelled its cruises with an option to obtain a full monetary refund. The cruise we had originally booked never sailed. I have been trying to obtain a full monetary refund ever since. We are an elderly couple and unsure as to whether we will ever get to use the future trip voucher. I now have a letter from AMA stating that no further refund is due since at the time of cancellation ""all sailings were operational, and... .travel was still deemed safe."" I am trying to make sense of this Kafkaesque situation. How can we be penalized for cancelling something that then ceased to exist for the very reason we cancelled it?"
