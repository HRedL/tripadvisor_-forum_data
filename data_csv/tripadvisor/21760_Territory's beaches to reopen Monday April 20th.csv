"I only visited one beach today Sunday - Brewers Bay by UVI -- the road was packed with cars from one end to the other on both sides and the tree line closest to the road was very crowded with mostly Dominican Republic folks sitting in big groups, loud music, BBQ grills and coolers all around.The beach had a fair amount of smaller family groups and some socially distant spacing overall but No Presence of any Official Oversight --although I did see 2 big VING trucks parked .I walked down, took my swim and stayed about an hour reading in my chair.Hope this behavior doesn't ruin the beach access for everyone ."
