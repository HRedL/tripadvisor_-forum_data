Has there been any talk in Germany of when US citizens be allowed into Germany? I mean via international flights that originate in the US. Is by mid-July at all possible?
"No, there are no plans to open European borders for tourists from overseas anytime soon. I guess one can expect the current travel bans to last well into the summer - and I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t get lifted before 2021. But guessing doesn’t help anyway, we all just have to wait."
"If you are planning on visiting Germany for a holiday in July I suspect your chances are virtually nil. There is no sign of any travel bans being lifted at present and when they are I wouldn’t expect the US to be near the top of the list. When the bans are eventually lifted it’s likely that anyone arriving will be told to quarantine for 14 days which pretty much puts paid to travelling for a holiday.Edited: 2:17 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"I rather think that internal Schengen borders will open first but then it will be a long time before international tourists are allowed, rather doubt this year."
"Yup, internal border are closed and the general vibe is that Europeans will not be able to travel within Schengen during the summer. Thus, it seems a pretty safe bet to assume that foreign visitors will not be allowed to come in.You also need to consider that Germany, for example, is appearing to have a handle on the virus while the US seems to still be climbing toward the apex with a lot more infections and deaths to come. This, too, would suggest that US citizens will likely have to endure a ban for the foreseeable future.Of course, all of this is speculation - nobody can give you a definitive answer. Still, I would assume that travel will not be possibleEdited: 8:10 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"In today's news there have actually been reports about tourism and Germany's Federal Government Commissioner for Tourism as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs have been quoted. If we are lucky, travel within Europe might be possible this summer, but there has been no mention of incoming travellers from Non-EU member states, so I assume that this is something nobody will even want to touch currently and therefore, far away."
"Even when visitors from elsewhere are permitted to enter the EU countries, it is likely that they will be subjected to 14 days' quarantine on arrival even if they come from countries with low infection rates (because they may have picked up the infection en route).Until an effective vaccine becomes available the world is going to be a very different place. Even with a vaccine the world for tourists will be very different."
"Thank you for all your replies.Edited: 4:43 pm, April 27, 2020 "
My hotel reservation in Bamburg for September was just cancelled by the hotel. Guessing it doesn't bode well for traveling this year. Waiting to see if others follow suit before giving up the dream.
"No pone knows for sure, but it doesn't look likely that the majority of European countries will be welcoming US visitors this summer."
"Yeah, I wouldn't welcome us either as we can't seem to have the patience or discipline to keep our social distances. With many of our States (including the one I live in) 'opening' back up and many just ignoring the guidance and orders intending to ease the tide of spread, our numbers will continue to go up and set up for what everyone expects to be a horrific second wave. Oh well, went ahead and cancelled rest of our reservations for this year."
"Actually, in New York City the new daily hospitalizations have fallen to under 20, which is about the daily cases in early March when it started. It peaked in early April at 1700. If you look at the graph it is a classic epidemic curve and looks like the virus is near over, eight weeks after it started.. The citizens didn't ""flatten the curve"". They have virtually ended it. With the spring season underway there's no way right now to be sure exactly what was totally responsible. Many viruses do not return. If that's the case here then US and European borders should be allowed to open to everyone by August 1. Then we should abolish all borders forever!"
That's the number of hospitalizations not infections. Based on your post and ignorance I hope that Americans won't be allowed into Europe /Schengen /Germany for a very long time.
"Trzsa, sorry, what you write is wrong. Here are the offizial numbers of yesterday:https:/…Do you think, 300 deaths in one day is not that much?"
"I hope your optimism won't crash too hard with reality, trzsa. Indeed when you look at the confirmed case numbers Covid-19 makes a perfect epidemic curve and could run out in a couple weeks: https://ddi.sutd.edu.sg/ But that development came thanks to stay-at-home orders, closed borders etc. We don't know whether the physical distancing measures still in place will keep the curve flat enough or whether the next exponential outbreak happens. So the fog is still very dense and we are driving with very little visible range. IF the infection rate remains as low as it is right now in Germany one could start opening the borders to countries with a manageable number of infections. But I think the US will be among the last ones in that line.Edited: 4:46 am, May 01, 2020 "
"Countries in Europe are all talking about people spending their holidays at home this year (domestic tourism) and today I read that the Spanish government isn't expecting borders to open until October. We had planned to go to Berlin (where we have our own place so could do self-quarantine on arrival) and our son and family this August, so this is not good news if that is what happens. Borders will in any case almost certainly be opened first for travel within the EU"
"""Based on your post and ignorance I hope that Americans won't be allowed""So one person expresses an opinion and you take it out on their whole country?You should know that new hospitalizations is all that matters. It is a direct reflection of the situation. As I noted the curve has almost ended. The media and governments are doing a good job of scaring people. In addition to abolishing all borders we should abolish all governments. We could have prevented this whole disaster with a fraction of the cost governments waste in a year."
"""""""You should know that new hospitalizations is all that matters""""No, that's wrong. Who told you that nonsense? Every sick person, if hospitalized or not, can infect any other person.""""In addition to abolishing all borders we should abolish all governmment""""""For sure!!!

"Thank you for the predictions website. They are indicating an end to the virus worldwide in the next two months. Other prominent virologists have postulated the same. SARS, similar to Covid-19, disappeared by June 2003 (with only several cases since). I'm not saying it will disappear forever; only that there is a the real possibility. Heck, the WHO does not still recommend travel restrictions! It's safe to say no one knows what's going on and what will ultimately happen.Edited: 6:07 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"Thank you again for the website with predictions. I have not heard or read any media or governments reports indicating that not only are cases dramatically falling in many locations but they are predicted to end by early June. I would think this information would cause everyone to give a an extra ""push"" to completely end the virus. Instead the media, some governments and mainstream ""top"" medical scientists are saying things like ""This is still in the beginnings"".If this virus does go away this spring and not return I have made a promise to myself to change careers and devote myself to changing the political world for the good of everyone in the world. I will definitely come to Germany, northern Germany that is, and bicycle all over! The only thing that will spread like a virus will be health, happiness, peace and prosperity for all."
I live in the U.K. and no one here is suggesting that the threat of the virus could disappear within a couple of months.We are basically being told that some form of Social distancing will need to remain in place for at least the rest of 2020 and basically until a vaccine is found and or treatments that help fight the virus and drastically reduce the mortality rate.
"As I read this entire forum post regarding US citizens being allowed in Germany, I am kinda scratching my head. It seems as if the original poster has written in semi denial mode and in circles. As with epidemics in general, only the sickest people are admitted to hospitals so the hospitalization. Rates of hospitalization can drop due to 1. Better medical treatment and identification early on 2. A reduction in infection rate 3. An increase in virus patients that exhibit no significant symptoms. There are other reasons, also. However, we are scheduled to return to Germany in December for our annual travels during the Christmas Market Season. I am generally optimistic but currently my thoughts are 15% that we will be allowed to travel. My previous background included presenting data to the FDA and doing clinical trials with emerging technologies all over the world.My experience does not qualify me as an Epidemiologist. I do read scientific papers and communicate with friends/professionals all over the world. The most accepted view is that we are in for a long and continued battle. It is virtually impossible to identify an asymptomatic carrier accurately. Current testing methods are showing significant false negatives and positives. Even serology test for antibodies are showing false negatives and positives. If someone wants to know the harsh reality of virus spread potential: 1 + 1 = 2, 2 to the 20th power = 1,048,576. While we cannot run scared, IMHO international travel from outside the Schengen area into the area will occur after the Schengen area allows cross border recreational travel to its members. Hopefully, quarantining will not be required.I can only speak for myself and my wife, we are most likely to be disappointed . However, we would rather the people in the Schengen area to be able to participate in their traditions and not worry about those of us from the US. We are living proof that there has been no consistent train of thought from our supposed leader. Be well, be safe, be smart. Keep exploring/planning travel in advance. Hopefully, 2021 will offer us all this opportunity to visit. 1NCF"
"The reason you are scratching your head is because the situation is completely new and no one, not even the top medical scientists know for sure what's going to happen. My opinion is shared by some top virologists - the virus will go away forever this spring. Right now the NYC official data indicates that at least the virus will be gone soon, like in two weeks. Doctors are not always right. Dr. Fauci was wrong about what would be the outcome with Ebola. There's nothing wrong with being wrong at times. In fact the greatest scientists failed many times before they got it right. Look at the Thomas Edison.Edited: 1:46 pm, May 04, 2020 "

"This is a travel forum. Please stick to travel related subjects. I have learned very valuable, practical, and proven information about Germany on this forum that would have not been possible by searching the internet."
"@#27 you are probably right. I just have read that according to an internal report published in the New York Times officials (i.a. FEMA) are expecting a daily increase in infections of 200,000 and 3000 deaths a day by June 1st. Quite a different view, isn't it?"
@#28 yes indeed it's a travel forum so take your spamming business elsewhere.

"There are still flights every day from the US to Europe. Who is on these flights? My American daughter and her German husband are set to come to the US next week from Germany for a 12 day visit. So far, all is a go. The flight from Frankfurt was cancelled, but delta moved them to a flight leaving from Amsterdam. Looking at the Atlanta airport incoming flight traffic, it shows flights from all over the world coming and going. ???"
Has your daughter actually checked to see if she can travel? As a US Citizen she is entitled to take to a flight to return home but she’s not returning home as she lives in Germany.I’m not that familiar with what returning US Citizens are being told to do on arrival but if they are being told to self isolate for 14 days then that’s going to make a 12 day visit impossible anyway. Also what is her husband’s status? Unless he is a dual national with US Citizenship then he probably won’t be allowed in. In Germany itself there is currently a travel warning in place which asks its citizens and residents not to travel abroad unless it is absolutely essential (which this clearly isn’t) until at least 14 June 2020.
"@Jennifer H: Cargo, business travelers, citizens returning to their home countries - there are still reasons enough to keep some planes flying.As husband of a US citizen your son-in-law is exempt from Trump's travel ban for Europeans, but CDC asks everyone returning to the US to self-isolate for 14 days: https:/…after-travel-precautions.html Are your daughter and her husband aware of that? I guess your daughter has a permanent residency permit for Germany. She will need it to return to Germany. And then again they are required to go into a 14-days quarantine - at least according to the rules valid right now: https:/…2317268 I doubt they will be lifted within the next 3 weeks.The German government strongly advises to avoid non-essential travel to ALL countries until June 14th anyway."
I think if things get to a manageable level maybe in Oct they will allow international travel but travelers have to wear a mask at all times.
"""I guess your daughter has a permanent residency permit for Germany. She will need it to return to Germany""According to the government publication I have just read spouses of German citizens are exempt, with or without permanent residency."
"@skihaserlmuc, Iteresting that despite almost 4 weeks from the T Troll's prediction that Covid19 cases would be gone in NYC in a couple of weeks, they are still developing.

Look at the situation in Italy right now. This may be the situation in the US in the next two weeks or so.

Just ask your president what he thinks of the WHO
given the current state of all the protesting that is going on in the USA no practicing of social distancing one can only expect there to be another significant increase of infections making chances of germany allowing travelers from usa even less likely just my opinion
"A friend and I were just sold tickets to Germany in November of this year. They told us that both Lufthansa as well as whomever else they called said it would be ok? I'm hoping since it's about 5 months away we will be ok, but I'm getting angry thinking a travel agency pushed tickets on us that might end up useless. We were hoping to go for two weeks, but it's impossible to find places to stay and so on without knowing anything. I've become so overwhelmed I almost just want to give up on it at thus point. I hope it opens, but as we wont be meeting with friends I might as well change the location :("
"Fingers crossed, Catherine."
"Yes, fingers crossed, but not much hope.And, by the way: Novembre maybe is the worst month for visiting Germany. It is dark, wet, cold, it rains a lot, and a lot of touristic destinations are closed."
This maybe just slightly off topic . just got off of skype with my sister who lives in Konstanz on the swiss border they are allowing travel across Germany/Swiss border for the past 4 days now but only with specified reasons no transportation of goods of any type is allowed in either direction my sis always buys her gas in Switzerland but at the moment they are frowning on that and course if you questioned that's not a good enough specified reason my other sister is heading for the Austrian border around Berchtesgaden will see what she reports back to me we have heard rumor's there are police controlling the mountain passes to prevent people from crossing over don't know how correct that statement is
given the current state of the world presently I think that leisure /vacation type international travel is quite a ways off even then it will come with restrictions and major compromises don't want to be a killjoy just looking at it with a realistic eye I want to be home in Germany with my family very badly but we are just going to have to wait and seeone of my brother in laws is a pilot captain for Ryan-air he has been sitting at home since march 20th he has been a pilot for 18 years he is not holding out a great deal of optimism at the moment
"EU Ministers of the Interior discussed travel restrictions yesterday and agreed to keep the outer borders closed for non-essential travel until July 1st. Thereafter gradual openings may be possible, the EU Commission will work out recommendations. So there is light at the end of the tunnel.The plan is also to lift all travel bans and border controls within the EU by July 1st. Many countries, like Germany, plan to open their borders for EU/EEA citizens June 15th already."
"As before, theres little to no general talk about travel outside of Europe and I wouldnt expect this until we have the opening of european borders behind us . The summer sees millions of normal people travelling from Germany to mediteranian countries like Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey, with massive numbers of aviation and tourist staff in Germany and abroad relying on getting that movement underway ASAP. It's justifiably the immediate priority before dealing with long haul tourism. What is interesting is that the general ban on travel to Germany from european countries is being replaced by a 14 day quarantine on incoming travellers from places with excessive numbers of cases, namely Sweden. Greece and Spain too are limiting travel from countries with higher corona numbers. The magic number in Germany is 50 cases per 100,000 people cumulative over 7 days. In Germany this is the threshold for a german city to trigger a return to lockdown and already Göttingen is teetering on the brink (case within a couple of large extended families linked to religious and family gatherings, but enough that the entire city may get shut down). The USA from my calculations is sitting on a figure of just below 50 cases per 100k over 7 days at the moment so on the upper limit of what would be permitted if it were a European country or German city. NOTE: thanks to German federal laws, health care and specific measures like quarantines are decided on a state by state basis, which can make things very confusing, but generally during the corona period they self coordinate once one or 2 make an initial stance. The quarantine for Swedish travellers was initially only in a couple of eastern states but now Bavaria has followed suit and you'd expect it across the nation soon with the rest. I would fear this may be the way international travel is dealt with, but hopefully they will learn from this piecemeal approach with Sweden and explicitly coordinate measures in the future for incoming travel between the federal states.Edited: 7:26 am, June 09, 2020 "

"@A Mainzer Goes Places, nice post. Many of us are baffled by the lack of planning by our politicians who seem to be more interested in scoring political points than facing realism. There are no absolutes but cases are soaring in many areas. Many are in the states that opened very early. It is coming back to haunt them, now.A major factor in travel and that is worth noting is that most/many of the air travel hubs are in areas that are/have been hard hit by COVID-19. Therefore traveling is like jumping in a giant Petri Dish.I cannot fault the Schengen Area for not allowing US citizens. Also, the T troll that started this post has disappeared after its predictions became a laughing stock. Be safe, be well, be smart."

"even though some countries , are now allowed as of July, there will still be the quarantine situation correct??"
"Bob, as a German citizen I believe you would always be able to enter the country, regardless. I don‘t think German immigration can refuse entry to a citizen. As for regulaions you will have to check the individual rules for the state you intend to visit. Common rules include mask requirement in stores and public transportation and you can‘t meet with more than 10 people. A 14 day Quarantine only applies to people returning from certain areas and I don‘t think Canada has been on any of those lists. But again you will need to check the regulations of the repsective state.Edited: 12:36 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"i sort of thought it had something to do, with the address given on my German passport . my German passport indicates my Canadian address. my other concern had been that when i arrived there, i would have to quarantine with my sister,' because that is where i stay, and the entire family would have to quarantine with me. regardless i would still have to quarantine because where i am coming from, regardless of my citizen ship. having citizenship does not get me around the quarantine thing, nor should it. i know the rules in the area where my sister lives , i am itching big time to go, there are some pretty decent savings on flights going on at the moment . saving more than $500, on a flight is very appealing as wellEdited: 2:44 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"Resident or not, German citizens can always come home, I haven‘t read anything saying otherwise. But yes, come July it shouldn’t matter anyway. May I ask Where are you getting your quarantine information from? Some states have ordered one for travellers returning from Sweden but I haven’t heard about any regulations for peope from other countries. Of course Most non-European citizens weren‘t allowed to enter Germany anyway."
"someone here had mentioned that my sisters family would have to quarantine with me, if i was staying there. I will have a definitive answer here shortly , just contacted my sister she will ask the questions Monday , will report what she says. but that might only apply to the Konstanz area"
"No I mean, where does it say you yourself have to quarantine in the first place?"
"What ?? it was an assumption on my part . as that was what is required here in canada .anybody coming in from out of country, was required to quarantine for 14 days, canadian citizen or not. why do i get the feeling you are going to tell me quarantine is not required ??"
I assume that would be fine but your Sister and anyone else who lives in that property would also need to isolate with you.this is one of the answers i got here on the forum
"like i said before, lets see what my sister comes up with on Monday"
"skihaserlmuc, sorry my wording may not have been the best and didn't mean to come off as arrogant. Having read and experience cancellations from our now cancelled trip to Germany (smaller, family run hotels have closed down), the comment was meant to acknowledge that the loss of tourist revenue to the local economy is tough on small businesses and the sooner some norm can be established the better. The estimated revenue generated by U.S. tourism to Germany in 2019 was 140+ billion dollars. The issues with Venice and, now to some extent, Dubrovnik are real and hopefully your comments are rightly directed not at U.S. tourist but tourism in general and more pointedly at the local and country governments not having a strategy to address the impact of ease of travel (pre Covid 19 of course)."
"2088bbob, the mandatory quarantine for travelers has been abolished weeks ago. Only if you come from high risk areas as defined by the Robert-Koch-Institute you are required to self-isolate. Currently that’s the case for travelers from Sweden as the infection incidence there is higher than 50 per 100K over the last 7 days. Borders won’t open for non-European countries with such a high rate anyway, so quarantine won’t be an issue for all those allowed in again."
"„The estimated revenue generated by U.S. tourism to Germany in 2019 was 140+ billion dollar“ Chatdad, that seems to be an inflated number to me given that American tourists „only“ spent 7 mio nights in German in 2017. https:/…"
„ why do i get the feeling you are going to tell me quarantine is not required ??“I don‘t know. Why don‘t you show me where it says you need to quarantine if entering Germany from abroad because that is not my understanding. As Mainzer says it only applies to travelers from high risk areas.Just like it never said anywhere you can‘t enter the country as a German citizen.  As far as I am concerned a universal quarantine for everyone entering the country has been ruled unlawful by several higher courts and has thus been suspended weeks ago and can now only apply go people entering from high risk areas.
"Young TravelerChill buddy , the statement („ why do i get the feeling you are going to tell me quarantine is not required ??“) was made because, it was my way of thanking you for giving me good news. the quarantine concept was conveyed to me by other posters in these forums . The times i have spoken to my sister in the last month we have not really discussed the quarantine ,so my bad for not drilling down on that subject with her. and i never said i could not enter the country as a german citizen . my questions were focused in regards to quarantine Oh and i am sorry i must have missed the note to me that said ,hey bob universal quarantine has been ruled unlawful so here are some facts ., that might give you an idea , why i as under the impression that mandatory quarantine was required upon my entry to germany. as previously stated i got the impression from what other people in his forum have written . 2) if you were to come to canada in the next 6 to 8 months maybe longer you will be by decree required to quarantine for 14 day s no matter what country you are coming from. canada has no approved country list . and it makes NO difference if you are a canadian citizen or not if you leave canada for any reason ,with the exception of being deemed an essential worker, you will be serving a quarantine period . they are enforcing that fervently. so that means if i cross the border to buffalo new york which is quite easy for me to do, for even 15 minutes to buy a candy bar i will have to serve quarantine when i return . and you better have a very clear concise quarantine plan when you return ,where when how ,and precluding staying with other members of your home, unless they were your travel partners. i will add that the canadian/us border is locked down solid right now, trade traffic is the exception .so maybe you can understand why i assumed i had to serve quarantine upon entry into germany again nowhere did i say . i could not , i did express concern that there may have been issues because my primary residence is listed as canada i hope that cleared some things up for you be safe stay safe"
"Well, the two question marks did come across a tad hostile. So did „Chill, buddy“, FYI. I have come here to answer your questions and I tried to get an understanding of where you are getting your information from to review it because I could have been wrong.Nowhere did I say that German citizens didn‘t have to quarantine, if a quarantine was required (such as if arriving from Sweden), I only said I believe German citizens have unconditional access to Germany and can‘t be refused entry at the border. So you are twisting my words here. As for Canadian regulations, I haven‘t looked those up and quite frankly I don‘t really care because I don‘t plan on going to Canada this year but I certainly never said that quarantine restrictions wouldn‘t apply to citizens of the respective country. I also think there is a very reasonable chance those decrees or regulations and laws might change within the next 6 to 8 months and that your country might come up with some sort of „approved country list“. Not that it matters for our discussion here in any way - but since you brought it up. And for what it‘s worth, using capital letters at the beginning of a sentence and a paragraph break every now and then would make reading your texts a lot easier, buddy.Edited: 10:55 am, June 28, 2020 "

"ALL tourism from abroad is worth €40 billion, and tourists from the US make up less than 10% of that number, so that €140 billion figure is plucked from the air :)"
"as expected, USA is not on the list of 14 safe countries which will be permitted entry to the EU . Those on the list are Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.Source - BBC: https:/…world-europe-53222356"
"I wonder what this phrase from the NY Times means: Travelers’ country of residence, not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union.E.U. Formalizes Reopening, Barring Travelers From U.S. https://nyti.ms/3eOs8RTCould this bar German citizens residing in the US from coming to Germany come July 1?"
German citizens living abroad have always and will always be permitted to come to Germany . As it stands they would need to quarantine for 2 weeks on arrival from non safe countries like the USA and that will remain the case
German citizens cannot be barred from entering Germany. If you come from a risk area you will however have to self-isolate for 2 weeks.
"Thank you for the clarification, would this apply for all EU citizens? Could a French citizen residing in the US travel to Germany July 1? I know they could transit to France, but could they stay in Mainz if they wanted to?"
"Strike my question, the new rules came out:For countries where travel restrictions continue to apply, the following categories of people should be exempted from the restrictions:EU citizens and their family memberslong-term EU residents and their family memberstravellers with an essential function or need, as listed in the Recommendation.https:/…"
"#87: Almost all inner-European travel bans were lifted two weeks ago already. Since then French citizens can visit Germany again as tourists and vice versa. Most non-European countries are considered high-risk areas, though, and German states require travelers from those areas to self-isolate upon arriving in Germany. The list of countries and American states can be found at the bottom of this website: https:/…Risikogebiete_neu.html under English archive."
"Hi. I have an Irish passport and live currently in Colorado (one of the non-risk states). Can I fly into Germany then? It seems so, right? (I have a rental car set up and was going to drive to Austria right away.) But I would have to self-isolate in Germany for 2 weeks it seems?What is the difference between quarantine and self-isolate please (sorry if it has already been answered).Thanks in advance."
"@90, It doesn’t matter what passport you have if you are coming from a country deemed high risk you will be required to self isolate for 14 days.Self isolation is when you are trusted to go to an agreed address and stay there for a set period in this case 14 days.Quarantine is when you are taken to a secure location and kept under a form of surveillance to ensure you do not leave until the set period is completed.Edited: 12:43 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Thanks Dean. I assume this would be one address or could it be two or more? I ask as I have reservations set up in Austria, each ca. one week. Which brings another question. Do you self-isolate in the country you enter (Germany for me) or could it be another country, say Austria?Edited: 12:48 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Gerry, residents of USA still are not allowed to enter the EU. As you are Irish citizen you can enter Ireland, but probably not Germany or Austria. Please read this:https:/…"
"Thanks Beate. I understand the overall blocking of US residents. But there are gray areas it seems?Lukasz in #88 wrote ""For countries where travel restrictions continue to apply, the following categories of people should be exempted from the restrictions: EU citizens and their family members""And Mainzer's link in #89 shows that my state is consider a non-risk state (Colorado)."
"Gerry, Colorado is part of USA and travel ban is for the whole USA. You have to go to self isolation or Quarantine in the country where you arrive. No you cant change places while in self isolation or Quarantine."
"#95: But Gerry has an Irish passport, so he is an EU citizen. Travel restrictions for EU citizens are lifted, so he can travel to Germany as a tourist. And since he comes from Colorado, a state not deemed risky by the Robert-Koch-Institut, he doesn't have to quarantine."
"Hello my husband is in the United States military and is stationed in Germany, I am also from the USA with a US passport. I have been in the USA since early March as I was visiting my family. I have not returned to Germany to my Husband because of the lack of flights and travel restrictions. I have a flight booked this Sunday because I had high hopes when booking my flight that the restrictions would allow the US to enter. As this is now not the case I am wondering if this would qualify for essential travel, I have his orders printed and it lists me as a dependent. I would appreciate anyone’s respectful thoughts or advice as I miss my husband! Thank you!"
"tori s, is there no way for the military to clarify this for you? Surely you’re not the only dependent in such a situation?"
"So I guess the ban means that my trip from Chicago to Frankfurt and onto Slovenia on Lufthansa on July 17, 2020 is a no go. Does this mean the airline has to cancel for me? I'd rather have them cancel and refund that have me cancel for a voucher. Advice?"
"Your guess is right. But the airline probably will do nothing for you, because they don't know if you have an accepted reason for entering the EU. So it is up to you speaking with the airline."
"Bheld, the answer is probably. A new list will come out every 2 weeks, so it will be updated right before your trip. It is highly unlikely the USA will make the list in 2 weeks though."
"Looking at Mainzer's comment:""But Gerry has an Irish passport, so he is an EU citizen. Travel restrictions for EU citizens are lifted, so he can travel to Germany as a tourist. And since he comes from Colorado, a state not deemed risky by the Robert-Koch-Institut, he doesn't have to quarantine.""Any more thoughts on this now? If I get into Munich on my Irish passport, is there a process where they check which state you come from (Colorado in my case) to see that you do not need to quarantine? Thanks."
Just pulled up this Ramstein AB page. I think your husband needs to ask his superiors what the situation is. Good luck!https:/…COVID_Travel
"If I get into Munich on my Irish passport, is there a process where they check which state you come from (Colorado in my case) to see that you do not need to quarantine?--I'd imagine it's done by port of departure. If you are able to fly non- or one-stop from DEN it will be in your favour. They may also ask for proof of residence. To be fair, I'm not sure anyone can really answer your question as most of us are in the EU in this forum, and arrivals from the USA have obviously been sparse in recent months."
"Thanks, and I understand. It would be nice if the EU would make a clear statement about US Residents that are EU passport holders as I am sure there are others in this situation."
The EU has made a clear position. EU citizens (passport holders) can enter the EU. Individual countries have their own restrictions though and you need to check those as well.
Lukasz: I understand but how it works is unclear. I am flying through Iceland to Germany. Do I show my Irish passport in Iceland and that is all that is necessary?
Gerry do you have to make a connection in the US ? If so is that place also low risk ?
Hi. I am flying from Denver to Munich with Icelandair so making a connection in Reykjavik. Colorado is a non-risk state I believe.
"Gerry, have you read this:https:/…1580226297.htmPlease klick on the isle of Iceland and see point 2 and 3.Edited: 10:22 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Thanks Beate. Wonder if that is new (I have looked at that site but maybe just for the final destination country so maybe it was there all along).""Passengers traveling through Iceland on their way to another Schengen Member State must have a written confirmation of their permission to enter the other Schengen Member State.""So the question then is how does one get this written confirmation. Is there a process in place to apply and get this?"
"Sorry Gerry, but I don't know either. Hopefulla other members here can answer."
"Print-out from the RKI.de website might be enough, but none of us are Icelandic border officers unfortunately."
