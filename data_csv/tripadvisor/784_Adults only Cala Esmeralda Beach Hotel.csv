"Can anyone tell me if the adults only Introtel Cala Esmeralda Beach & spa is an easy walk to the marina and bars and restaurants? Ate there plenty sunloungers etc? Looks a fab hotel, thinking about going end of April will most places be open?"
Not much to laugh about really Danny. So many people going to suffer.
"Hi. We have stayed at this wonderful hotel several times, pre and post refurb. It is about 15 mins from centre and another 10-15 mins down to the Marina.There has never been a problem with sunbeds whilst we have been there. We usually stay in June or September. Have a great time."
