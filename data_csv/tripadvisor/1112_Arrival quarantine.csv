I’m trying to wade through all the info . On arrival to Greece from the uk would I have to quarantine currently ?And is this what is likely to change with the air bridges ?
"Currently, yes you would. If air bridges are agreed by Greece, which isn't the case yet, a proportion of arriving travellers would be given a COVID-19 test at the first Greek airport they reach, but be allowed to travel to their destination. If the test is positive, then they have to isolate for 14 days. There will be more information later today, but it seems likely that arrivals from all EU or Schengen Area member states would be allowed in. The UK of course no longer qualifies....."
If they test positive they will be taken to a quarantine hotel where they will spend two weeks locked in their rooms and monitored by police and medical staff.
"#2. Exactly what does ‘self-isolating’ mean for someone instructed to do so, say in a hotel room, please? (Information is not for me but it’s getting asked quite a few times on various forums now). Thank you."
"All a bit strange really , I wonder what proportion and I wonder if a lot is lip service . It’s all quite counter intuitive especially when you consider how valuable British tourism is"
So you go to your resort no matter what . Curious
"Distinguishing between self-isolating and quarantine is difficult because they seem to mean different things in different countries. I believe the UK have never had quarantines with police checks etc? Only advice to self isolate?In my view, self isolating means you voluntarily stay in your home/ hotel and avoid contact with others but you can go out if it's necessary (to the doctor, to get food). Much like #stayathome Quarantine is mandatory 100% isolation (no leaving your home/hotel room/quarantine facility under any circumstances) with police doing random checks on you at various times of day and levying heavy fines for non-compliance. In Greece there seems to be mandatory doctors visits to check if you are OK medically.The email I got from Aegean Airlines says that if you are tested, you have to self-isolate for 24h at the address you declare on the form. After that (and this is not from Aegean), you are either free to continue with your holiday (you tested negative), or you are taken from your accommodation to a quarantine facility (you tested positive). You remain in that facility, in your room for 14 days. You can't go out. You get food at the door. Not sure about what happens with room cleaning, etc. I have watched several vlogs by people quarantined in hotels in China and other countries- they had to do their own cleaning with the change of linen and everything else left at the door.Edited: 3:26 am, June 29, 2020 "
"This is how the quarantine hotels are going to function:""According to the ministry announcement, selected facilities will exclusively accommodate individuals infected with Covid-19 and their families or accompanying members.In addition, restaurants or food services of these units will cater only to Covid-19 cases and their family members or close contacts. Hotel staff will be required to adhere to all health regulations and precautions. Food will be served on special trays placed outside the door of each room and the operation of swimming pools is prohibited.""https:/…"
After all the excitement of thinking i may book a trip to Rhodes it’s starting to feel like it’s not worth the gamble . It would be soul destroying and expensive
Does this put people off travel ?
"The situation will hopefully become clearer once the Greek governments makes an official announcement, but I don't see how a self-isolation rather than quarantine system could work for people staying in self catering accommodation, particularly individual properties, How would they get food supplies for their time there?"
Why would anyone gamble on wasting Money and time invade your get tested and it ends up being positive
I think many people still do not realise the consequences of being tested positive. It hasn't sunk in yet.Testing positive while having no symptoms is not that unusual in higher infection countries where the virus is more widespread than in Greece. It's actually very common but normally discovered by chance as they do not go to a doctor. The problem with people who have already had covid19 or have no symptoms is also that they can test positive for several weeks. After several weeks they are not infectious anymore but the virus genetic material is still in their system and will be detected by RT-PCR test.I don't think people with symptoms of infection are going to travel knowing that they will immediately be spotted and isolated as suspicious cases but people with no symptoms may really get a nasty surprise on arrival in Greece.
Exactly what I’m thinking . Just cos you feel great doesn’t mean you don’t have it . Any idea if things are happening the same way in Cyprus ?
I read somewhere that Cyprus is planning to random test around 15% of tourists so in my view it's even riskier than Greece if you are looking for a holiday and not a quarantine.
What are the percentages in Greece ? Any ideas ? I mean I get it but we need to get tourism going . Greece needs it but this is going to spook people
"It may have changed since but in May they announced that the percentage will depend on the epidemiological situation in the departure country. For low risk countries it's only one or two passengers per flight https:/…Edited: 10:34 am, June 29, 2020 "
Thanks . That’s interesting l think the week will will bring clearer news
"We booked yesterday to a hotel that was cancelled back in May. The flights have gone up by £100 today. But we're reading today that Greece will not except visitors from UK Until 15th July because our rate of cases has risen. Testing does not bother me, so if there is an agreed air bridge, we will go. I'm sure that it's safer in Rhodes than in the UK."
I wonder how much the surge in Covid19 in Leicester will affect the thinking of the Greek authorities. It may at least cause them to do more testing on people arriving from Birmingham and East Midlands airports.
Would be gutting though if a positive airport test scuppered your hols
"#21. Well, it has done already for some!!"
"oh yes for sure but imagine thinking you were as fit as a fiddle, then last minute qt the airport, its over"
That's because we now know who is most at risk for developing full blown Covid-19 and most people who are planning to travel this year are not in this group.
">>> That’s very true but I have spoken to a couple of people locally, middle-aged, who a month after having Covid-19, still feel weak and not yet back to full health. So...it doesn’t discriminate. Any victim will do!! <<<=======True it does not discriminate.On the flip, I know someone in their late 50s who had a scratchy throat, intermittent dry cough and a mild headache and was a fit as a fiddle within 7 days. There is the dichotomy.Edited: 2:07 pm, June 29, 2020 "

>>> Would be gutting though if a positive airport test scuppered your hols <<<=====That may well be part and parcel of the 'new normal' for sometime to come. A vaccine is more than likely a year away *if* one is ever successfully developed. It is by no means a foregone conclusion that one will ever be developed. So these risks will just become part of life.
Anybody know if Rhodes is still functioning as a holiday resort yet? Sites to visit/restaurants open etc?
"""That's because we now know who is most at risk for developing full blown Covid-19 and most people who are planning to travel this year are not in this group.""That's far from true in my experience. Many of those I know who still plan to travel are of 'more mature' years i.e. over 60. Although not in the truly high risk age group they are certainly at higher risk."
"If they are at risk and still intend to travel even if their insurance may not cover them for Covid-19, then they are rather irresponsible."

They may be more likely to contract coronavirus but asymptomatic means they are not going to burden the Greek healthcare system.
#34. Are you seriously trying to tell me that an asymptomatic carrier CANNOT spread the disease????
"They can but to a much smaller degree. Even WHO admitted that concentrating only on symptomatic people would severely limited the spread of the disease. 30 year olds are also most likely only socialize with other 30- year olds which means if they spread it, their ""victims"" are also likely to be asymptomatic and not burdening the Greek healthcare system.What other infectious disease do you know where they have to search for it with genetic tests and isolate asymptomatic people so they do not spread it? It's really time we all went back to normal and stopped being obsessed with people who have no symptoms.Edited: 12:11 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Well, you have to look who the asymptomatic people are and who they are most likely to infect. Are they coming to Greece to work in care homes or socialise with old and frail Greek ladies with multiple comorbidities? Most likely not. They will be moving in their own circle and socialising with other tourists of the same age, young and healthy.The poster above suggested that the algorithm that decides who is tested should give preference to them, older people with risk factors rather than the young and healthy on the basis that old people are more ""responsible"". Sorry, but no one from at risk group travelling abroad this year with insurance not covering Covid 19 is responsible. Only the young and healthy can get away with it because they will most likely not need any medical help. Given that some countries with lower prevalance of the virus got so paranoid that they are hospitalising people with no or mild symptoms, the cost of such irresponsibility may be enormous.Edited: 1:10 pm, June 30, 2020 "
">>> 30- year olds which means if they spread it, their ""victims"" are also likely to be asymptomatic <<<=====There is no evidence to suggest being asymptomatic is a function of age.I do however agree that that life must come out of hibernation and a new normal must be found - this new normal must be based on a vaccine not being developed. It is no good putting life on hold waiting for a vaccine that may never come."
"Based on my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), everyone has to populate a form prior to flying - and the airports are targeting people with testing based on high-risk areas.If you are tested, you have to stay at your address for 24 hours until the test comes back negative (If positive - then obviously formal quarantine).Based on what i've read - it says that you have to stay at your address for that 24 hours, but how does that work in a hotel? Can you use the hotel facilities. I.e. Pool etc. Or is it a case of you not being able to leave your room.Any thoughts?"
#40 would be interested to know this as well
"I assume that in a hotel you would be confined to your room until the result came through and food and drink would be delivered via room service. A bigger problem is for people who are self catering. How are they supposed to get through 24 hours, or more, without any food or drink?"
