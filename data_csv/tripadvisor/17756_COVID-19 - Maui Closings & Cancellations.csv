"I'm sure we're all tired of talking about it, so I apologize in advance.We are travelling to Maui April 1-8, staying at the Maui Eldorado. For now, our trip is still on.However, I'm worried that we will get out there and a lot of the typical touristy places will be closed due to containment efforts. Have any of you locals seen a shift like this happening?We can reschedule our flights & condo at no penalty. But, with 4 kids, two full time jobs & two side businesses, time just the two of us is not easy to come by. I'd hate to reschedule again (we originally had this booked for last November). While our entire trip is not packed with the touristy stuff, we do have some on our itinerary. I'd hate to go out there and not be able to do half the things we want to.Thanks!Edited: 8:59 am, March 11, 2020 "
In a couple of weeks we are going to find out if this is going to be really bad. Your trip falls right into that timeline. So hard to know what to do. Just have a plan in place if you get quarantined or someone in your party gets sick.
"I'd cancel. You know the annoying commercials that say, "" Ask your doctor?"" Who are you going to call on Maui? Covid-19 isn't in the same universe as typical tourist complaints fielded by some walk-in clinic. Maui Memorial -- other side of the island -- is all there is. Do you think it will be overwhelmed? I do. Here, your doctor is your entree to covid-19 test kits that actually exist -- and have fast turnaround. Your MD will be available for other complaints, too. On Maui?"
"Hi Little Bird — you may want to start monitoring Maui’s local news outlets to get a sense of local closures and cancellations due to COVID19. Here’s a link to the Maui News, others can no doubt suggest further sources:https://www.mauinews.com/"
"First, Maui may not be Chicago--but we aren't some tent city either. Yes, we have multiple clinics and doctors--like MANY. Will you be able to get medical care? YES. Will it be as prompt as you'd like, or in as flashy a setting as some clinic at NW? Well, probably not, LOL. But you and millions of tourists get medical care on Maui every year, and survive the experience.......Sue gets a tad dramatic IMO.But the bigger issue is the progression of the virus. WHO declared it a pandemic finally, today. That's just a term that acknowledges what many have been saying for a month or more--this WILL affect the whole world (except maybe Antarctica). So does that mean it will keep spreading...yes. I used an example from New York yesterday to illustrate how this can go. New York went from 2 confirmed cases to 173 by yesterday morning---in a ***week***. NY has been aggressive in testing and Hawaii has not. Most of us believe we have more--and have had more-than the official ""2 confirmed cases"".So, consider the rate, progress, reliable sites and info, and then discuss it with your family. Only you can decide what is best for you. Also, stop and consider whether a vacation spent worrying is really a vacation.SW"
You might also find some of the info here helpful:https:/…105976806I will of course post any major closings I see.
"As of now I haven't seen any ""typical tourist"" places closing or planning on closing. Of course this is a fluid situation and things can and probably will change day by day. I only see it getting worse in the next few weeks and beyond."
I heard Vegas is closing buffets and pool/pool areas.
"Yes, but that's Vegas :-).Nothing similar here on Maui yet.Maybe fish can tell us about Kaua'i, since that's where she lives."
"For a one week trip... you can do a lot without worrying about what is closed. With that said... things won't close unless there is bonafide imminent health risk to their operation (possible, but not there yet)... or there's just not enough visitors to warrant them operating (not there yet)... or the there's some kind of government mandated shutdown like Italy (not there yet)."
I can see luau's going the way of Las Vegas buffets maybe
"We are there at approximately the same time as you-April 4-17, and staying at the Eldorado. We booked with private owner and our accommodation is non-refundable.I don't care about tourist things. I am more than happy to rot on the beach for 2 weeks. We do like fine dining though and would be having at least dinner out.The state of how the US is handling this in general is what concerns me. And I believe what SW says is true, there are more cases out these that have not been identified due to lack of testing."
I guess if you've never been... a Luau is good... but if they do cancel... you can get one heck of dinner + a few mai tai's for each ticket.
"For some reason I think I will feel way better once we arrive there on March 25th. I doubt I will be checking news and websites as mush, once I am actually there. This time before we actually leave is more stressful with news popping out all over my phone, email etc..."
"""And I believe what SW says is true, there are more cases out these that have not been identified due to lack of testing.""From what I've heard and read, it's more about the lack of reason(s) to test. Which makes sense if, in fact, many of those who contract the virus are asymtomatic."
"Sadly, MG....no, that is not true. Many, many doctors wanted to test more people since the end of January--but were NOT allowed to by the Hawaii Department of Health.While many people do start off (and some mild cases even stay) asymptomatic---health care providers all over Hawaii were trying to test many people. It didn't matter. The gov and DOH said no.Even now.....the new test procedures will result in skewed results.Check the thread about COVID-19 info for more details."
One doesn't have to live on the island to know what's going on on it. Even folks that live on the mainland are very well informed!!
"""Many, many doctors wanted to test more people since the end of January--but were NOT allowed to by the Hawaii Department of Health.""Could that not be because Hawaii's DOH was following CDC guidelines about who should be tested, and the limited capacity of the public health laboratories through which those tests were to be coordinated? And how many confirmed cases of COVID-19 are there in Hawaii now? (2?) Were any (either) of them actually contracted there?"
Nope. I posted details in the info thread.
This so sounds like threads that began appearing on the Italy forums 2-3 weeks ago.
"Thanks everyone. Still unsure what to do.I didn't even think about the luau. We do have one planned that is a buffet. I think I'm at the point where I really don't want to get ill and stuck in Maui on quarantine. We are in our 40's and of good health, but should anything go awry, I'd like to be home. I think that's giving me the most anxiety.AND, our flights on Southwest go from Chicago to Seattle to Oakland to Maui. That's a ton of travelling with a ball of anxiety hanging over my head.We'll see..."
Can you just go later on when this is over? The sooner people stay put the sooner that can be.
"Little Bird, I would actually cancel at this point if I were you. All else aside, the 4 kids factor is significant. I have five sons, and my husband and I owned a farm together, so I get that time away on your own is a rarity. But parenting and business ownership also increases the challenge if anything goes sideways. In the best of circumstances, your original flight itinerary is tedious. If you reschedule, maybe you can hit upon better options (e.g. not making two stops en route). ~ Colleen"
Please...just cancel.
"I am also traveling there in 13 days with husband and 3 kids. My condo through Quam is non-refundable. It took a ton of saving to be able to go on this trip. Now, I don't know what to do. I would be happy just sitting on a beach and snorkeling. Also, will happily just make food in our condo. But, I am so worried we will get quarantined on the island and not be able to get home. My husband needs to work for us to live and I have a son in 6 AP classes and he needs to get back to school after the break."
"I wouldn't worry about being stuck.  I'd worry about being sick before you even arrive, or getting it on the flights. See if Quam will give you any kind of credit for a future stay.Next time, but trip insurance.Edited: 11:54 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Yes, definitely learned my lesson about travel insurance :("
"sunshine since one of the first things they do is quarantine a personI surely would be concerned about not getting home if you have the situation you describewe have travel plans coming up and that is one of the things we discussed, being quarantined for 14 days just by coming in contact with someone testing positiveif you are home that's one thing as you can self quarantine at home...on the road different story all together good luck with your decisionEdited: 12:02 am, March 12, 2020 "
Flatten the curve. Info here. TA reinstated butvI don't see post in feed.https:/…105990602
"This is NOT essential travel. Stay home. Maui will still be there once this *crisis* is over. You could think about canceling (losing funds) as the cost of health insurance -- for your family and for those whose lives you spare as you help ""flatten the curve""."
Thanks everyone. We have decided to reschedule our trip. Looking at late September/early October now. How's the weather out there at that time? I'm so thankful our VRBO owner is being so flexible and allowing us to reschedule with no penalty.Thanks again for all your feedback!
"I think you made a very wise decision. Whether you got sick or not is only part of the issue, as mentioned. Possibly carrying it to others and not being able to enjoy your vacation are also factors.I would go for October. August and September are our hottest months--it can be very, very hot and muggy. We also have a higher chance of tropical storms, though hurricane season runs from June through November.October has the Maui marathon mid-month, and Halloween in Lahaina is a big deal at the end of the month. You will want to keep those in mind :-).Best wishes, and stay well.SW"
Thanks for postponing. Pono choices matter and count a lit in the grand scheme of things.People still pondering may find this doctor's opinion helpful https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
"Somewhat related news...Disneyland is closing until March 31st. They haven't had ANY cases--they are being proactive. I would also think hard given what Trump said today: ""President Trump said on Thursday that he could restrict domestic travel to regions of the United States where the coronavirus becomes “too hot.”Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office whether he was considering limits on travel inside the country to hard-hit states like Washington or California, Mr. Trump said the subject had not yet been discussed, before adding: “Is it a possibility? Yes, if somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot.”When does an area get ""too hot""?? One case? 100 cases? What happens if you can't fly home because your flights were to a ""hot"" area?"
"There is no COVID-19 in Maui, i am here and my friends said it is safer here than at home. Just wash your hands a lot. Better quarantining on a beach than anywhere else."
We are to arrive on March 26th. Looks like we can't cancel our condo. I'm worried we will get stuck there or how to quarantine when we get home to Alberta.
Ummmm.....are your friends doctors? Epidemiologists? Or just owners of vacation rentals?????No one knows whether we have it here. Most of us think it's been here for at least a month. Sorry to burst your bubble.
"Yeah, saying there in none there when a huge amount of the tourists come from the west coast and Asia just seems like sticking your head in the sand. On a (kind of) more positive note, it appears Hilton (GW) has updated is cancellation policy to allow refunds for any reservation if canceled 24 hours in advance. https:/…"
Don't go.
"Don't travel if you don't HAVE to travel. You WILL be 'inconvenienced' for sure. You WILL help spread the virus, which will last longer and cause severe illness and DEATH to many. (As well as prolong the financial crisis.)"
"We r here now. All jazzui tubes closed. Grills close at 9. Not a lot of people out. National whale sanctuary closed. We have had great time, but today saw less going on. Most bars and restaurants seem open. Good luck!"
"We’re due to arrive 3/21, also feeling unsure about going. Thanks for all the info shared here..,"
Westjet will cease transborder flights as of March 22 for a minimum of 30 days. Air Canada likely to follow? Yikes.https:/…
"Where are you staying, wildchick?Please cancel. We have another case confirmed....a tourist again. Please people, CANCEL."
"Since someone mentioned trip insurance: it typically doesn’t cover you if you just decide you’re too freaked out to go. We have it, but unless one of us actually gets *diagnosed* with it (God forbid) travel insurance will *not* help. We’ll be out thousands for our condo rental. The business has already confirmed no refunds no matter what. So lame.Edited: 12:37 am, March 17, 2020 "
have you tried asking them to keep the money to apply for another date to reschedule when this calms downI have had success with that a couple of times in the past not related to this issuea friend just did that for a May trip to Kauai rescheduled for Oct and the owner just moved the money to those datesgood luck
Now there are 2 cases on Maul.
"To elaborate: Things are changing rapidly. Now there are 2 cases on Maui and my best information is that they do not need to be hospitalized. For some people, sitting on a beach and going back to a virus-free condo is a better choice than going home and working on the front lines of a hospital. For most tourists, there are now problems with flights and medical insurance coverage so all we can do is hunker down and wait and for most people, that means at home. Hoping my Maui friends stay safe and tourism manages to stay afloat."
"Re : Cancellations and refunds. If you are with a small mom and pop vacation rental, please ask about various types of compensation besides refunds right now. No one wins if they go bankrupt, lose their property and the big conglomerates with deep pockets take over. Ask if you can transfer to other dates, ask about deferred refunds, Ask about partial refunds, ask about having free dates in off season. Be creative, but let's all take care of each other."
"Woodbridge - people have been reporting various results here - more so with credits for future bookings vs. refunds. Without knowing which agency you've booked with, it's anyone's guess, so it's best to call them.Suggest reading the suggestions here for requesting a credit: Scroll down to the section on ""Canceling your vacation rental or hotel when no waiver exists""https:/…Hope you can work out a reasonable solution with them."
"Woodbridge, see if they will agree to move your reservation (and money) to another time within the next 6 months or a year.It is getting worse here---just like there at home for you. Losing the money paid would be bad........but having huge medical expenses on vacation would be even worse.PLEASE, please......don't travel unless you must."
I’d cancel. All tourist attractions are now closed for the next 30 days.
"Ummm, no, jaqueline. I wish they had closed things weeks ago. I wish they would have closed them today but they haven't. I still don't want people traveling."
"I just returned from Maui, and I tried to post about my experience. Thanks to @thewindowstothewalls my post got deleted. If you want, you can private message me, and I’ll tell you how my 6 day trip went."
"Rob - nice of you to offer to share your experience of your trip. But the situation with COVID 19 is changing so fast that your experience was different than what people will have in the next month or more. Closures of parks, restaurants, facilities and events will mean a difference now for tourists. The risk of contracting and transmitting COVID 19 increases daily. There's a high chance that someone on your flight will have COVID 19. Someone reported on another thread that protests are taking place at OGG against tourists coming to Hawaii. I didn't see any news articles re this, but it wouldn't surprise me that this is happening. Best to avoid non-essential travel for a while."
This no joke! Don’t travel! Stay home! Thank goodness things are starting to shut down! There is no money on earth to put your family and ours in the islands at risk
I live here and all resturants and activities plus your pools will be closed. You can go on hikes with social distancing thats about itI would reschedule. We are required to stay in our condo unless necessary groceries or medicines. All fun stores will be closed.
You can always ask TA to re-instate your post by going to the Help Center. They will do it.
PLEASE STAY HOME. https:/…
"My family just arrived yesterday. Already regret it. Cancel your plans . Stay home. Westin told me at check-in they may be closing in days. All parks closed. Can't even drive up the mountain. Whalers village is a ghost town. Total loss of a trip. All of our activities have cancelled. No horseback riding. Nothing. Total waste of time and money. Airlines talking about plans for all passengers being thrown in mandatory quarantine. Possible airport closures being discussed. ""Isolate the Islands against visitors"" by politicians."
Cancel. Here now and regret it.
"Thanks for providing that feedback schoepmd ... it was probably tempting not to say anything here after your 'no worries' sentiment on Wednesday, just two days before your trip. Despite your mistake in going ahead with your trip, good on you for now providing honest, blunt feedback ... and echoing the advice that has been given here about not travelling to Hawaii.Edited: 11:05 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Thank you for honest feedback. Stay safe as you can.Edited: 11:16 am, March 21, 2020 "
"@ schoepmd, Thank you so much for posting. In fact, it really would be a service to everyone if you posted a new thread where more will see your story. This is such a strange situation for everyone. Some of us still haven’t reached the moment where it really hits home. That message to “shelter in place”, for lord only knows how long, is hard to take. But it truly is urgent now. You could do a lot of good by sharing your story here and on other social media. Take care. Wishing all the best to your family."
"+1 to Teri's comments, schoepmd. It speaks volumes that as of a few days ago, you were heading out on a trip with no worries ~ and are already regretting that decision. Do you think you'll stay as long as you'd planned, or cut your losses?~ Colleen"
#62 THANK YOU. Sorry for your situation. Appreciate your honesty.
"I agree--many mahalos for posting. No matter how many times I or other residents say it, sometimes it has more impact from a tourist.I hope you are able to chart the best course for you and your family. Personally, I would go home."
So sorry to say but I am on Maui now and they are implementing a 14 day quarantine to all incoming to the Islands! Change your plans! Not worth the risk! All state beaches are closed! Restaurants and Bars and many Hotels! Stay home!
"The PROPOSED 2 week quarantine has not been implemented. It hasn't even been fully designed or settled, much less approved and implemented. It will be more time in the making.Yes, state parks, trails, and beach parks are closed, The only state beach park on Maui is Makena, also known as Big Beach. Beaches remain open and so do County beach parks.....though personally, I wish they would be closed.Hysteria and false statements don't help anyone. Please don;t post false claims."
"Hello Parent, unfortunately as an American your Government and fragmented health care system has inconsistently messaged the risk to you.There is no vacation travel anywhere right now. Leave the citizens of Maui alone to manage their COVID 19 with their own healthcare facilities. you should be locked down in your home for the next 30 days, USA is trending upward to match Italy with infection rates. This is far more serious than you know."
Hi-am on Maui now and have been here for a week. Everything is closed down. All luaus canceled. A few restaurants with take and go food. Malls and most stores closed. Public beaches closed. News conference today are saying they will do health screening on all coming from mainland and you may need to quarantine for 14 days. Have to Hawaii several times and would advise against grave here right now. Many mainlanders are heading home early.
"You WILL have to quarantine for 14 days after March 26, 2020 at 1201 AM. It's not an option.https:/…Edited: 10:11 pm, March 21, 2020 "
Hawaii just announced 14 day Quarantine for anyone arriving.
"Yeah hours ago....I posted it right above you.....And beach parks are closing Monday. Here's a link about that:https:/…Edited: 2:15 am, March 22, 2020 "
Do you know what is happening in there USA? Lack of tourist options is not for biggest problem. Social distancing and #StayAtHome
"We are not canceling yet. If the island is shut down, then why waste money. On the other hand, the locals request are quite useless. The business class ( the only class the matters) want commerce.. The Hawaiians do not get to pick and choose. If they feel that way. they should be starved until they collapse. They are Americans! We don't play these games. Colleen and others have got the game twisted. All 3 of you are tired.Edited: 10:07 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Hawaiian has announced they are cutting all mainland flights down to *one*. That one flight will be between LAX and HNL, once a day.The mandatory quarantine goes into effect this Wednesday night/Thursday morning at 12:01 AM. All visitors arriving will have to stay in their lodgings for 14 days. The only exception is medical care or to leave the island and go home.All parks, trails, activities, ocean activities, restaurants, bars, clubs, and shows are closed. Only takeout and delivery food is available from *some* restaurants. Many other stores and businesses have also closed in compliance with the Mayor's Orders.Some hotels will start closing soon....partially if not completely. Stores are barren of most goods, including food. As soon as shipments arrive goods are snapped up.The Mayor is issuing another order soon....telling people to stay home after Wednesday----unless they are essential workers.Edited: 10:19 pm, March 22, 2020 "
Here's the Mayor's Stay at Home Order:https:/…
"In Lahaina, groups of locals are throwing things at Visitors on the streets and shouting for them to GO Home ! Not safe. Everything is closed. Stay home. Weather is nice, but, it's not the time to come. We're pulling forward our departure flight to tomorrow from Saturday."
"I'm glad you were able to move your flights.The first ""official"" death in the State from COVID-19 was reported late last night. Very little info except it was an Oahu resident who had other health issues. The case was NOT one of the known cases..........and the disease was only confirmed posthumously (after death). S/he died on the 20th according to some report. But how many others have been infected for weeks by this person......???PLEASE, don't visit. PLEASE. We can't afford you.SW"
"Please stay home. We lived on Maui for a while. During this epidemic the locals don't want visitors. And you and your family will be quarantined for 14 days as soon as you land. Fun, huh?? Besides, everything is closed. Everything. Please stay home."
