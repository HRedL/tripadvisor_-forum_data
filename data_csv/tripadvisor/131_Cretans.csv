Great post that speaks volumes.
"Based on our knowledge of our Cretan friends and their families this sounds very true, thanks for sharing."
This is why we love Crete and visit often. Thank you Dimitris.
Many thanks for this post. For almost 40 years of coming to Crete we have found all you say about the Cretan people to be true. The changes you mention that have taken place over the last 20 years or so haven't changed the Cretan character.
"One thing I would add is not just for Cretans - but it certainly applies - but for all Greeks, in almost all cases their total honesty and generosity. Where else in Europe would you hire a car without a credit card, or be offered a lift home from a taverna which would be left completely open while the proprietor was away? I often look at Greece and the Greeks and think we have lost our way somewhere..."
"Steve, what you said reminded me of our first trip to Greece with my husband in 1962. We'd left Athens for Delphi, and in the middle of nowhere somewhere near Thebes the car slowed and stopped. We'd run out of petrol: the fuel gauge in the unfamiliar car that we'd picked up an hour before had looked full, but was reading empty. A minute later a lorry driver saw us, stopped, drove my husband to the nearest petrol station 10 miles or so away, drove him back, and replenished our tank. When my husband tried to give him some money he refused; my husband tried again, and he refused again. And again. The driver finally won the fight, of course, being Greek. I can still see the two of them jumping up and down in the road, my husband trying to get him to accept the drachmas, the driver pushing them away, with many ""ochis"". I'd been to Greece before, and wasn't surprised; it was my husband's first visit, and he was hooked for life. And when we first went to Crete in 1981 and experienced Cretan hospitality and generosity, he said, with that 20-year- old encounter in mind, ""They're even more Greek than the Greeks"".Edited: 1 year ago "
"Nice one, Alabastron!"
KalimeraThank you for your feedback. Keep going!
"A great post Dimitris, it really highlights, what we British people love about the Greeks. They are the most genuine people, it is the main reason, Greece is my favourite country.Dimitris, I know Cretans are very proud of their heritage, so I apologise for generalising by using the term Greeks. This is because I have only been to Crete once, (soon to be twice), but I have been to Greece many times.Alabastron, I loved your experience, it so typifies the generosity of Greek people, what’s the likelihood of that happening in the UK?"
Great story Albastron and a lovely positive thread :-)Edited: 1 year ago

Totally agree Gemma and I have added the thread to the Top Question section :-)
"Thank You for this post Dimitris, We are planning a trip this time next year for our 3rd visit to Greece & our 1st to Crete. I can't wait to experience the culture, Greece is one of our favorite travel destinations not only because of the history & beauty, but because of the wonderful people!"
Great post - Thanks !
"ΗιWe don't know if this is true but people tell this story for years and years and might be something of a myth but shows how deeply rooted is the hospitality in CreteKazantzakis once brought his foreign friends in his village Μyrtia and asked his fellow villagers to treat them as his guests and take them to their homes for a couple of days because he happened not to be able to take them to his home himself.He however, arranged so that all necessary provisions to be brought to the villagers houses because they were poor people and couldn’t afford although they offered what they could.So, for the next couple of days tables with delicious traditional foods were set around the village and Kazantzakis guests were smitten by the generosity of the villagers, their lust for life and their energy to drink raki. Of course they slept in the villagers houses at nights and were shown around the village during the day.As soon as they left the village to return to their countries Kazantzakis explained that these visitors were the future of the island and a good source of income and he told them he would send some more of his friends next week and that he counted on their hospitality and to think about his advice.The friends arrived and had an excellent time experiencing the same generosity as the visitors before them. When Kazantzakis send a telegram to be informed on the situation in the village, they told him that they wanted to offer more but they couldn’t as they were poor people. The same thing happened yet again as new visitors on behalf of Kazantzakis arrived to the village. They had the best hospitality they had ever experienced.However, the villagers sent a telegram to Kazantzakis and explained that as much as they wanted to have guests in their village this was getting difficult because they couldn’t afford anymore to be hospitable to their guests.Kazantzakis asked them why they couldn’t afford although they charged their guests a small amount of money for the hospitality.To his surprised the villagers wrote back : You must be insane! To charge them for our hospitality???! What a shame that would be!"
"I don't really know Greeks. I've made friends with a few Greek lads&lasses in Astoria, NY. They were really the ""Greeks don't want no freaks"" types really. A few Greek seamen, I've met in Haifa downtown discotheques during the days of my youth, - they looked and behaved like Israelis. They didn't speak Hebrew, but that's it.All the Greek people I've had met ever since were Cretan Greeks. They all have left most positive impression on me and my family members.Generosity, kindness, openness ( when a gorgeous lady in Crete is smiling to you, and wishing you well, - this is it. No hidden agenda, no dirty thoughts. She really means it ), hospitality, self respect, etc. All these virtues came highly appreciated by us. That's why we've decided to visit Crete again in Summer 19.I recall of what Jean Cocteau wrote about Jean Marais: ""He's like a cocktail, with all the ingredients being of very fine quality!"" I'd say something like that about the Cretans.Yuri.Edited: 1 year ago "
"So very true. This ""What did you have?"" billing has occurred to us once. Honesty Box style charming practice.Yuri."
Just love this thread :-) (and yes we have come across honesty boxes as well :-)).
"HiAnother thing that Cretans absolutely love is the traditional Cretan dances and never miss a chance to dance. Cretan dances express another aspect of Cretan civilization one that is lost back in time. In fact any form of circular dance in Greece is rooted in Crete and were circular religious dances around the altar of a God or a Godess.It is also said that circular dances are taught by Rea, the mother of Zeus herself to the tribe of Kourites so that by the noise of their dancing steps to disguise the crying of Zeus so that it wasn't heard by his father Cronous who so wanted to eat him alive and save his throne.Cretans appreciate their circular dances and really enjoy dancing them partly because of the feeling of belonging that one gets when dance in a circle. The circle makes everybody feel welcome and accepted that’s why very often tourists are invited to join. This way the tourists are somehow forced to notice the steps and feel the rhythm and make contact with the group of dancers and by this way they feel part of an ancient culture."
"Dimitris, are the Cretan dances very different from Syrtaki we all know?Do you happen to know a place in Malia, our family could participate?I recall reading and article ( many moons back ), it was about Cretan Dances being originated in Bronze Age ( Mycenaean Civilization). So, it's very ancient cultural stuff...Yuri."
"Yuri, I was just reading along ... but you prompt me to add something. The DANCE insttinct in Crete & in all of GReece dates back millennia. In the Naxian mountain village of Apiranthos there is a tiny Archeological Museum with artifact dug up in the mountains. One of this items was selected by the Goulandris foundation to be sent to Olympic Towers in NYC about 15 years ago for a huge exhibit of unexpleained prehistoric artifacts, Called ""Ths Silent Stone Speak."" This is a rock about 2 feet long, carbon-dated to be at least 4000 years old ... and on it there is a row of scratched ""stick figures"" -- they are holding hands, and their feet are moving --- they are DANCING,In 2010 I was in Chania, Crete ... it was in the depths of the Greek economic crisis, unemployment among young people was over 25%. THere was an announcement on the radio -- Cretans wee going to lift the spirits of Greece by a DANCE -- a long iine of dancers llinking hands, all along the North Coast highway from Chania lll the way East to Sitia. Locals and visitors were invited to join in. At 12 noon or so, music blared from radios -- people scrambled out of cars, came from nowhere - linked hands... and danced! It went on for at least an hour -- it was caught on TV perhaps on YouTube still. I couldn't help but think -- in that time of stress and economic upheaval Europeans picketed, in US, they did a confused ""Occupy Wall Street"" ... In Greece -- they danced."
"Travelerjan, thank you for your inspiring post. Good on you.Yuri."
ΗιI want to thank you all for your honest comments and I hope to see more.This kind of sharing is very inspiring. Cretan dances must be from the oldest in Europe that's for sure if not the oldest.I remember thinking in the middle of the economic crisis that people who sing and dance like Cretans they certainly find their way out of the difficultiesAnd one video with Cretan dancehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WohPGwWAS2Q
"Yuri, the Sirtaki that we all know and love is not actually an authentic and Ancient Greek dance but was created for the film 'Zorba the Greek' but still epitomises the Greek style of dancing."
"Good morningSyrtaki is a popular Greek dance internationally. It is not an authentic traditional Greek dance. The Zorba the Greek (The ""Zorba"" book by Kazantzakis, published in Paris in 1947) was created in 1964 for the film Zorbas from two old Greek dances by the slow-blowing of ""Hasapikos"" and the fast moves of the ""Hasaposervikos"".The music for the Syrtaki was written by Mikis Theodorakis. The main characteristic of this dance and his music is the acceleration in the rhythm. The name Syrtaki comes from the word syrtos, a common name for a group of traditional Greek dances.The Syrtaki is danced with the formation of lines or circles by the dancers, who are held with their hands by the shoulders of the fellow dancers. The measure is 4/4, rising gradually and reaching 2/4 in the fastest part. Dance start with slower, smoother moves that gradually become faster, lively, often including small leaps.Whatever the technical details, Syrtaki is a magical dance!Edited: 1 year ago "
More fabulous posts and great information (gets my vote for Thread Of the Month (or year :-)) :-))
"Thanks Dimitris! No one could described it better! That's why we love Crete! Will be back end of August and will meet you and so many lovely and generous people for sure. As Nicky from Neromilos (Sissi) said to us after offering us so many free drinks and food that we said she was giving away the whole profit and more: it's not about money, it's about making friends and gave us a big hug!"
"Hi The main Cretan dance nowadays is Pentozalis. It is said that this heroic dance had been ordered by Daskalogiannis, a Cretan hero and rebel who was skinned alive by the Turks.He commissioned a violin player called Kioros to come up with a dance the steps of which can communicate hidden messages for stating the beginning of the 5th revolution against the Turks.So, the name Pentozalis means 5 steps (zala in Cretan dialect meaning steps) and states the beginning of 5th the revolution against the Turks. It has 10 steps in memory of October 10th 1769 when the decision was taken to start the revolution in Sfakia. It consists of 12 musical turns in memory of the 12 Chief warriors of the island of Crete .Kioros was inspired by an ancient Pyriheio (war dance) and created Pentozalis. The importance of this dance even today is strong because as I have already mentioned democracy and freedom are paramount values to Cretans.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WohPGwWAS2Q"
More great information and a great link too :-)
"thank you Dimitris, what a fabulous insight into the Pentozalis, I read up on this after visiting Preveli and Frangokastello last year, but to see it in action is amazing xxx see you in 3.5 weeks (not that I'm counting ha ha ) xxx"
"Hi allI want to add that together with Pentozalis a very special place in the hearts of Cretan people is reserved for mandinades.Mandinades are 2 line verse poems that ryme and which consist of 15 syllables each verse. They mostly have a complete meaning in these 2 verses which is deep and original and many times philosophical even. Other times the meaning is not complete when there is a competition/ rhyme battle (exactly like rappers do) between 2people and a conversation is building much to the delight of the people around.Mandinades are sang in celebrations and festivals accompanied with music from lyra or are simply told without an instrument in companies or in cafes or in everyday conversations. A lot of them are forgotten but the best are told again and again so they stand the test of time. It is an oral tradition but nowadays they can be found in written form as well in books or the web or be filmed.It is a spontaneous expression of the wisdom of the simple Cretan folk people, a special way they use to talk about whatever troubles them or makes them happy. There are mandinades about love of course but also about anger or nostalgia, about revenge and to teach or very often to tease with the funny verses, kind of a stand up comedy. And of course there are sad madinades about the death and missing of beloved people. All in all there are mandinades about every life situation one can think. Of course, there are mandinades in other parts of Greece but Cretan mandinades are the most special because they are still produced and there is no sign this is going to stop and mainly because of the richness of the words and the complexity and wisdom of the meanings and how artful they are. It is magical how mandinades still convey in words a rich civilization rooted deep in time which still speaks in the soul of the people today and truly teaches them about life. As I have already said the equivalent of mandinades is in other parts of Greece and in the world. In Crete there are signs of it since 6th century B.C in prophetic verses, later in Hellenistic times in funny short verses and in Byzantine times there are verses found that resemble mandinades.But during the Venetian occupation a Cretan poet named Vitsentzos Cornaros wrote a 10.000 verses love poem (in 1590A.C ) Erotokritos which was sang or recited by heart. This probably inspired so much the Cretan people to take short verse poems to the next level.For Cretans it is a much loved way of entertainment, a way to show what is in their soul, a soul that is very manly but yet very sensitive as Kazantzakis used to say."
"Hand in hand with traditional dances and mandinades goes the love of Cretan people for the Cretan wine.With a history of 4.000 years Cretans surely know how to make wine. There is archeological evidence that Minoan Cretans cultivated, stored, enjoyed and even exported wine! This was not because other civilizations didn’t know how to make wine but because the Cretan soil and sun gave wine of superior quality.Actually, the production of Cretan wine never stopped during the centuries that followed even though the island was occupied quite often. For the history the Romans who were wine lovers created big vineyards all over the island and made Cretan wine famous all over the known world . Trough Byzantine times and especially under the Venetian occupation the wine production was bigger than ever.It was, however, followed by a low period during the Ottoman occupation as the consumption of alcohol was forbidden due to religious reasons.When Crete joined the rest of Greece beginning of 20th century the times were difficult for a while because of the wars. Due to mixing old and new varieties and the help of technological progress but mostly due to the love of Cretans for the wine the production still goes strong till our days.The love of Cretans for the wine is justified because it is used in all occasions of their lives. It is used to celebrate new life, in the ceremony of marriage, in Holy Communion, in all festivals and celebrations, in cooking and baking. It is used to seal new deals and as an excuse to make peace when arguments arise. It has made long dark winter evenings around the fireplace pass pleasantly and has given comfort to people in times of sadness. It has inspired poets and novelists from the ancient years and has been the inspiration for many folk songs and mandinades.All in all this blessed product is tied strongly with the life of people in Crete."
"More great posts and information and thanks for taking the time to write them Dimitri :-)p.s. ""It is used to seal new deals and as an excuse to make peace when arguments arise."" :-) :-)"
"Hello everyoneWhen I started the topic I didn't think that I get so much inspiration about it!The amazing fact that Cretans make this blessed product that is the wine for almost 4.000 years has shaped the lives of local people in various ways and is a basic reason why tourists from all over the world become so charmed by the Cretan way of life.Wine production and wine drinking are important parts in the lives of everyday people in many villages all around the island even to this day. Cultivating the grapes is a strenuous task that requires patience, knowledge, passion and to a certain degree surrender to the elements of nature (mainly weather conditions). Throughout the centuries local people have come up with numerous traditions to help them ease their worries, to give them hope or consolation and carriage in case the cultivation/work of a whole year went wrong. Possibly Minoans but also ancient Greeks had deities protecting the wine production, the most well known of which is Dionysius. There were back then wine festivals and celebrations around the year which included worship, wine drinking, delicacies eating, songs and dances. Christianity incorporated many of the needs and rituals and further sanctified the lives and the hard work on land of the people. We can certainly trace many if not all of the above in the traditional customs of the people today. First of all in the use of wine together with bread for the Holy Communion to sanctify the whole production and the many prayers for fair weather conditions. Then the many celebrations upon each step of the production. The planting, the picking up of the crop, the group work of actually turning the grapes to juice as well as the actual opening the ready wine. All these celebrations go even today hand in hand with a lot of wine drinking, delicious mezedes, Cretan dances and mandinades (Cretan folk songs). These were and also are the times for locals to interact with each other and for the families to bond and even arrange marriages or financial matters. Something else we still do today is to clink our glasses before drinking and make toasts for good health and prosperity. This simple habit they believed chased away the evil spirits and bad luck and as a bonus produced a very pleasant sound. Furthermore the clinking of the glasses was used as a way of reconciliation. People who had differences had a way to end them and talk again by clinking their glasses so the sense of unity was restored. Another way to express the friendship and closeness was to cross their arms and drink . As to what kind of wine Cretans drink it is obvious that every area has their own very good quality local wine at a very good price. On top of that thousands of families in Crete make their own house wine that is not for sale, however it can be gifted in special cases, just because it's not enough production and that's why it's called house wine. House wine is a special mix of different wine varieties in certain quantities only the family of the house knows. Of course there are a lot of wineries all around the island which make excellent wine. Actually, there are 12 indigenous varieties of grapes that are used for winemaking in Crete namely Mandilari, Kotsifali, Liatiko, Romeïko, Vidiano, Vilana, Thrapsathiri, Melissaki, Dafni, Plito, Muscat of Spina's and Malvazia Di Candia? Don't they sound exotic? The classic varieties like Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet, Sauvignon Blanc and others are quite outstanding as well. So, visiting Crete is also an opportunity to get off the beaten track and discover amazing wines.I hope that by this small article it becomes clear how wine is a strong part of Cretan way of life."
"Thank you for more information, Dimitris.The cultural transformation from Ancient Greek to Greek Orthodox, and from GO to the whole World culture is fascinating subject indeed. So many outstanding examples: κλήρος - a piece of land in Pre Archaic era, became a sanctified place by the altar ( usually where the choir is located ). BTW, the ""clergy"" comes from same root.Re wine: Nowadays in Israel, we've got plenty of brands of Sweet and Half Dry Moscato/Muscato wine. There was Dry Muscato wine, just a couple of decades ago of many makes. Now, - there's only one, and not very good one, by me.Is there Dry Muscato Wine is Crete? Which brand would you recommend?Same question about Retsina wine. Is there a good Dry Retsina wine in Crete?This very special Greek wine reminds me of many happy occasions, I've enjoyed in Astoria ( Greek area in NY ) in the days of my youth.Thank you.Yuri.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Dionysos, god of theater and wine, was believed to have first appeared in Greece in 8th century B.C. It was proved by an inscription found in Chania in 1990, that this god had already been worshiped here in 1200B.C.This text agrees with mythology. According to this inscription, Dionysos and Zeus(his father) were worshipped in the same place, the sanctuary of Zeus. The same quantity of honey (two amphoras) was offered to each one of them separately."
More great posts :-) There is so much about the Cretan temperament and history that reminds me of Scottish Highlanders :-)
"That kind of temperament, Jock?https://youtu.be/cA6ektXRVak"
"Oh god, I'm going to get nothing done today trying to catch the comments before they're removed!"
hahaha that's the one Yuri :-)
"Adorable!I recall receiving the link to that sketch during our flight from Heathrow to EDI. We've watched first time right after checking in to our hotel ( Apex on Grassmarket ). We laughed, and left for a walk. Around us, there were people speaking exactly like that! Fabulous experience, most memorable.Yuri."
"Your post made me very sad. I used to go to Crete a lot (the reason for my use name) but stopped going and cant remember why. I'm currently in Messinia and they are lovely people as are other Greeks. But I miss Nopigia, Alymidyia, Agia Roumeil, soda, Elounda and so many more places. I've not been to the Sitia area though - time to return I think!"
HiThank you all for your thoughtful comments and for taking the time to read through this long article! For me also is fascinating when I trace how far back our traditions go and how we share similar traditions all around the world!In a world that flirts with vulgarity it is always nice to be reminded of civilised ways of the past!Yuri just take a tour at the following linkhttps://tinyurl.com/pbzsrk5
"Wow, just wow!!! Plenty to explore...Thank you,Yuri."
"HiI have written so much about wine and the deep connection with Cretan way of life that it would be a big omission not to write about fresh food coming both from plants and animals! In my memory I can see my father some 50 years back in time to wake up after his afternoon nap to take care of his small garden and the few animals at our backyard. I can see him accompanied by the sounds of the hens and rabbits, ducks and doves as well as the sweet barking of my beloved dog Tommy to take care and water our tomato plants, cucumbers, aubergines or peppers.He would plant all kinds of vegetables to season in small quantities but enough for a family to eat and have some spare to share with the neighbours when they came visiting!Actually the door to our house was always open and my mother would take every opportunity to put together some mezedes, fresh vegetables from the garden and raki and this way set the background for a greattime with friends and family.50 years later, and my father still attends to his vegetables without the small animals since the neighbourhood has become an urban modern environment to live in.Although I have travelled a lot since and I am aware that food plays a huge role in all cultures I have a strong feeling that in Greece and particularly in Crete food transcends its material quality!It first and most of all brings people together to connect that's why it is more important who are the participants than the food itself which can be very little and simple in difficult times when money is little without spoiling the good mood.However, this is not the case most of the times so housewives take this opportunity to present the participants with a great variety of delicious mezedes and other recepies. After all they cater to a demanding crowd that knows about good food since birth!I still remember the times we would visit families whose cooking was not to our liking we had no appetite no matter how hungry we were!It is safe to say that no happening in Crete is without connection to a big celebration around a table. Be it a simple meetings of people who haven't seen each other for some time to weddings, baptisms or name day celebrations. To business openings, graduations, first jobs or any success along the professional career. You name and occasion and there is a get together of family and friends around a table! Many times without a reason just because we enjoy the company!"
Another brilliant post and thank you for sharing your insight and memories.
Thank you for sharing. In 2 months I am going to visit Crete and after this article I am even more interested. I have a list full of historical places to see! Here we come adventure!

HiAt the folowing link some recipes to open your apetite!https:/…
"Dimitris, your comments about the Cretan spirit at the start of this thread, -- and about the fact that modern changes have not altered the Cretan values -- prompted another memory of mine from my first Greece trip 20 years ago, still vivid in my mind today.My friend & I, driving the North Road in May, decided to seek a room for the night in Ag Pelagia. Most places appeared not to be open, but we saw a promising building with a nice view & an open door, so we entered. In a shady lobby a young man was stacking linens to go to rooms upstairs, and he happily showed us one. He explained that the owners, his parents were not there because they were harvesting onions, and pointed out the window, where indeed there they were, filling baskets in a large market garden.Looking at the sunny day outside, I asked, don't you sometimes wish you weren't working indoors but out enjoying the beautiful weather. The young Cretan suddenly became serious -- No, he said, I feel lucky to be working here, because tourism now makes it unnecessary for me to leave to make a living, but instead I can stay here... in the land that I love. His expression of love for Crete and for his village stays with me."
Great link Dimitri and saved to favourites :-)
HiThat's a very good story indicative of how much Cretans love their island. It also exlpains why Cretans don't really care for taking long breaks for holidays because they live and work in a magical place. It's also easy to make time because the traditional celebrations help people to take time off their jobs and connect /socialize and decompress for all mundane everyday tasks. So there is no need for official holidays .But of course there are Cretans since the ancient times that had genuine curiosity and wanted to travel and see the world.
Thanks for the insight Dimitri :-)
"HiA few days ago I was on a Cretan mountain with old and new friends on the occasion of the birthday of an old man. We were only ""boys"" at the mitato* of the celebrating man and we enjoyed mezedes, raki and Cretan music from our amateur friends.Of course, plenty of stories, jokes and teasings went on between us.During this nice company time, I listened to one very interesting story about how people long before the cars, marked paths in the mountains.They used to let a donkey uphill because donkeys walk zigzag by natural instinct, almost the same way the car roads that drive up the mountains are designed today.The villagers walked behind the donkey and put signs all the way and for the next few days they made sure to use the path with their animals several times to clear the path and make it very visible.When someone asked the story-teller why they didn't use a horse, he answered that the horse is faster than the donkey but rides straight on uphill as opposed to the donkey which takes also the weight and the safety into consideration!More stories, mezedes with raki and jokes between us kept our company very happy till early morning when we enjoyed the sunrise before we slept till very late next day! * It is a small house at the mountains where the shepherds stay"
Fantastic story that made me smile.......thanks for sharing :-)
HI Dimitris its actually KRITIKI

Hello Dimitris. What a wonderful post. Thank you. I am astonished that I have never seen this thread until this morning!
"Dimitris l think you are looking at this through rose colour glasses:There was a time roughly between the late 50s and mid to late 1960s that anyone that could or had the resources left the lsland and went as far as they could :They immigrated as far as Australia New Zealand USA Germany;Its very easy to be on the outside looking in but the reality of Crete is that the people are struggling there is little work tourists industry is only open half year round and there is a lot of Russian influences there ;In Particular in the tourism industry:Since the economic crisis they still have not been able to recover ( As for all the other things you say about the locals l cannot agree more but it’s a little hard to see who is a local now just listen to their accents when they speak Greek We go back and visit as often as we can with money in our pockets and think wow this would be a great place to live but the reality is different to the holiday images :any way long live the KRITIKIEdited: 6:18 am, December 07, 2019 "
"Comet27 certainly has some nerve to lecture a Cretan resident and business owner about his country’s culture, economic situation and even the language! Post # 63 is quite breathtakingly disrespectful to Dimitri, a regular poster and Cretan native."
"Well said, 2Bristolians."
"2bristolians, I don't see the post in question as disrespectful. I've met Greek folks expressing very same ideas. With all my respect towards Dimitris, he's not an average guy. Dimitris is an extremely hard working, successful businessman. Most people are not like that. I don't think Dimitris is wearing pink tinted glasses at all. His opinion is very much valid, but it's not the only one.Re Russian influence in Crete: We were very much surprised to meet great many Russian speaking folks in Crete. Many are repatriants to Greece, either from Pontian Greek origin, or descendants of the communists who escaped to USSR during the 50's. Many come to Crete only for a half year Summer season.Economic success is a very relative issue. To these folks from Ukraine and Russia, Crete is a step above. BTW, not them only. I've met a Pakistani gentleman, who's moved to Crete. Apparently, there's a small, but steady growing Pakistani community in Crete.Yuri."
"Wow, Dimitris thank you for the history. I really appreciate the insight to the struggles Greece and the islands have had to overcome. My heart is with you all the way. You are a brave and courageous country."
"Dimitris, you've missed Israelis in your list, but I forgive you.As I've written, economical terms, of success ad poverty are extremely relative. An officially recognised as a poor person in Greece is consuming more vitamins in his/her daily diet, than a rich person in Sweden.Cretan way of living isn't simple. I don't think everyone is cut for it. Working long hours, 7 days per week during the half year long tourist season. Then, resting and taking care of all other things during the other half of the year. Sounds mad to many folks from US and Western Europe. Yuri."
Comet was born in Chania has business in Chania relatives in Crete lives abroad knows a lot more about what’s going on in Crete than some two bob British tourists who may visit a few times that think they understand Greeks comet can say anything he likes about Crete
Anyone can say anything he/she wants about Crete. These are free boards.I do admire Comet's syntactic eloquence though. Reminds me of my poor attempts of translating from German.Yuri.

"{One of my wishes is the millions of the Greeks around the world to come back in their country permanently or semi permanently.}Dimitris K Thats a dream . In a recent conversation with my Aunty who was born and raised in Crete and is in her 80s and emigrated to Australia then came back to Chania with her family to live about 30 years ago , I asked her why did you come back here to live and her answer honestly and truthfully was .Because we were stupid, We should have never come back .I left it at that .So once again all the so called Greek experts that think they know about Crete and actually only really go for holidays there because its dirt cheap compared to the UK. Maybe they should have a real conversation with real locals and then decide . Otherwise you are just cheap tourists on a cheap holiday.Edited: 7:15 pm, December 07, 2019 "
"I'm certainly not a Greek expert, just someone who loves the Greek islands and has been visiting on holiday for many years. However I disagree that Greece is 'dirt cheap compared to the UK.' It might have been when I first started visiting in the 80s when they still had the drachma but like many places prices have increased over the years and we can eat and drink just as cheap in the UK as in Greece - not that you can really compare a meal in the local Wetherspoons to sitting outside a taverna with home cooked food drinking local wine and of course the wine in Greece is still excellent value for money compared to the UK even if the beer is often dearer."
"Greece isn't dirt cheap. Not anymore at least. It's of fantastic money value, especially with the food.I don't know Greece well. We've visited Crete twice. Next Summer we're going to Pelion. I hope food in local taverna's will be as good as in the most Cretan ones.Greeks and Scotts do have in common very sad historic vision of their own ancestral country being unable to provide for them. An Englishman did sing: ""England is my home, and it owns me a living!"" ( Morrissey ). No Greek, nor Scott would even dare to think this way.Yuri."
"I apologize Yuri that I forgot the Israelis. Ιt is a small country but they present a satisfied percent of tourists in Crete and all over Greece.My personal story is that I came back to Crete in 1998 (I never had cut my bonds with Crete) and I haven't regretted my decision, not one bit. In the begining, it was difficult becase I had to try more for things that in Europe are obvious (mostly in the form of Public Service since we are an old nation but a new country formed only in the middle of 19th century as Hellenic republic) but in the end I am very happy with my decision as I have already said.I know that my wish {One of my wishes is the millions of the Greeks around the world to come back in their country permanently or semi permanently.} can be a dream but who can stop me from dreaming ?There are Greeks who regretted coming back. It's a strange, complicated situation you put yourself into and a feeling that you don't belong nor to the new country you left nor to your own country. So regret can be the easiest word when one is trying to explain.I think that you are very hard on the members calling them ""two Bob"" or Crete experts with an ironic mood mood because they are good ambassadors for Crete tourism.I even happened to meet tourists that had better understading for our country in some areas than I had.Greece after euro isn't anymore a cheap country but neither a very expensive one because there is a good value for money as it was very well explained from the forum members. A lot also who visit Greece have a good knowledge of why they visit and money is not the only factor.I see a bit of bitterness and scorn in your writings that I hope will go away and you will get a sense of optimism for Greece and Crete!"
"Dimitris, I agree with you that Greece isn’t as cheap as it used to be. But as a tourist I think it respresents good value for money, tavernas and bars still offer good value for money.I also agree that the majority of people don’t visit Greece for value for money. There are many people like me that visit Greece because we love the people, the culture, the beautiful scenery and great food."
"Comet. I do hear the pain expressed in your posts. I can perfectly relate to it. Yet, you're too agressive towards the posters for no good reason to it.Why am I a ""cheap tourist""? What is a ""cheap tourist"" anyway? Cretan economy relies on tourism heavily. What is the point in insulting people supplying food on your relatives table?BTW, I'm comparing now prices in Crete, with those in Pelion. Flights and accommodations in Crete are a leage above more expensive!There're no regular direct flights to Crete, before Spring. Once Blue Bird announce their flights in late March ( 370$ return ), a few other Israeli air carriers begin to sell tickets for Summer. Prices rise up to 475$ per return flight.Pelion - without waiting for the pre Summer season madness, I've booked with Agean Airlines to Athens for 220$ per return flight already.Accommodations: I've paid 130€ per night in the tired 3 * Socrates Hotel in Malia. Please compare with the same level hotels in Pelion: 85€ pnpr at Enalion Hotel in Kala Nera, and 100€pnpr in Kenta Beach Hotel in Agios Ioannis.See the difference?Yuri."
"This is a great insight into two sides of the same story, and good to see that the discussion is being allowed to go on without posts being deleted. I may be just a "" two bob tourist "" but I feel a great affinity to the Cretan people I have met over the years visiting the island and made some very good friends too. The stories I have been told over the years by the Cretans I have talked to do reflect both sides of the story presented here. We Scots and the Irish have gone all over the world in the past, and not always because we wanted to ( re the Irish potato famine ) but most of them come back if even only to visit the Old Country again. There are many reasons people love their own little bit of the world but its not always possible to make a living in your own back yard.As Rabbie says,Then let us pray that come it may,As come it will for a’ that,That Sense and Worth, o’er a’ the earthShall bear the gree an’ a’ that.For a’ that, an’ a’ that,It’s comin yet for a’ that,That Man to Man the warld o’erShall brithers be for a’ that.Edited: 7:25 am, December 08, 2019 "

"all the so called Greek experts that think they know about Crete and actually only really go for holidays there because its dirt cheap compared to the UK. Maybe they should have a real conversation with real locals and then decide . Otherwise you are just cheap tourists on a cheap holiday.Crete is not a 'dirt cheap' holiday for anyone coming from England, We work 48 weeks of the year , myself as a nurse, to visit this island we have come to love over the years, we come to meet the Cretan people, learn of its history and visit its beautiful mountains, villages and bays, I find your generalisation offensive"
"Well said Karen. Crete is a beautiful island and I visit Greece for the beautiful scenery, picturesque villages, delicious food, friendly locals and of course the weather. I could probably go to other destinations if I wanted a cheap holiday but Greece has been my first choice of summer destination since I first fell in love with Spetse at the age of 19 and long may that love affair continue even though it is not 'dirt cheap' compared to the UK."
Lovely to see you on the forum Karen :-)
"I have watched this thread about to comment but not sure what I wanted to say, still not sure however I love Crete, it's people and my fellow visitors, whilst I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion Comet I find your way of expressing yourself insulting."
"Yuri U yes you have some good points. But last year a lot of tourists avoided Crete because Turkey was cheaper I hope on your holiday you make an effort to converse and get to know the Greek people on Pelion . Dont just judge whats going all around you on the opinion that the food was great the waiter was happy and the flights were cheap .Find some Greeks talk to them .By the way Yuri i did not realise that you were appointed the feelings police for the forum as to wether the posters got offended or not.Edited: 7:18 pm, December 08, 2019 "
"Comet, I'm not a feeling police here. You've been rude for no good reason. There's a way to hold a civilised discussion without calling anybody in demeaning manner.Our limited exposure to the Greek people ( not the waiters and hotel employees ) was most positive.We felt very comfortable while being surrounded by the Greek families on the Castro Beach by Heraklion. There was a Greek, Russian speaking family we had a nice chat in Taverna Kreta in Malia. Another nice Greek family by the pond in Zaros...In fact, one of the pluses of Pelion on our behalf is it being a mainly Greek family holiday destination.We wouldn't go to Turkey even if it was for free. I grew up with many Armenians, and I can't allow myself to go to Turkey. Sorry for bringing my politics to these boards. Usually I don't do that.Yuri."
Yuri U enjoy your holiday I wish you all the best

"London prices are not a true reflection of prices in the UK comet, just as Santorini prices aren't a true reflection of prices in Greece - though I'm sure Londoners know of cheaper places to go just as regular visitors to Santorini do as away from the caldera prices aren 't much different to those on other Greek islands. On the occasions my partner has been to London for the rugby final he always complains about the price of beer in London which can be double what he pays in our local pub ;-)"
"Comet, as has already been said London prices are nothing like UK prices in general. As for the coffee, if Starbucks is the best you could find in London, you obviously went to the wrong places. Starbucks coffee is distinctly average, perhaps it's good by Australian standards."
"UK isn't a Coffee Country in general. By me, the Greek coffee is nothing to write home about. Not to mention the unhealthy public obsession with the stomach ruining Frappe.Where about in London? Of course you can pay £6.7 per pint at the Craft Beer Co in Covent Garden... Many would just walk a few minutes to The White Hart and have almost the same pint for about half price.Comet, the general tone of your post is aggressive. We're friends here. You don't have to fight anybody.You can't compare UK and Greece as tourist destination countries. Apples and oranges!Greece can't offer the moss covered pathes of the Dartmoor National Park, and all of them free wondering ponies. Not to mention the magnificent English gardens, and spectacular stately homes. Go to see the gorgeous lakes in the Lake District, the ""chocolate box pretty"" rolling hills in the Cotswolds, woods in Wiltshire, etc, etc, etc.UK can't offer the aquamarine coloured warm waters of Eagean Sea, and exquisite Greek Cuisine.London is my choice of the Cultural Capitol. All sorts of concerts, ballet, opera, exhibitions, and museums.Really no comparison here.Yuri."
"""Starbucks coffee is distinctly average"" I think thats being very kind :-)"
"Hi to everybodyIt sure is nice to have such a flood of comments! However, it seems to me that the discussion is going another way than the one intented.And back in topicI have another story to narrate although I will not say the name of the village or of the people there and I also don’t know in how many other villages the same plan is followed.I was younger than 10 years old and I was hosted by family in a village in the middle of Crete during Christmas holiday.An evening I visited a home full of people, most of them older men but quite a few women too. The majority was sitting close to the fireplace but because there was not enough space to sit close, the rest of visitors shared burning coals in metal buckets all around the room and they talked loudly drinking raki in wine glasses.Later, I understood that it was the mayor with his team and the older men with their wives from the bigger families of the village.They discussed about the landslides on the trails around the village and how dangerous they were for themselves and the visitors coming from the surrounding villages with their animals for social visits or trade.After a lot of talking they decided every family of the village to volunteer with one person and all together divided by teams to walk all around the village to clean the paths and do what was necessary to make them safe.And so, they did and the next morning more than 60 people mostly men were gathered. Some families even sent more members for help.I stayed in the village and I helped the rest of the people to organize a small fest for the workers when they come back.It was an excellent afternoon when they came back and we enjoyed all together very tasty food with wine. After that, many continued with the party at their homes with their friends.Few days later, almost the same people met once again at a neighboring home and the problem this time was of a widowed woman with five kids who had lost their field with all its crop of vegetables from the overflow of the river.All together with one voice they decided a couple ways to help the family.One gave her one ditch of tomatoes another one ditch of onions other one a ditch of beans and that way nothing missed from the family this difficult winter from this family!Now, when I come to think of all the clever ways people used to solve every day difficult situations, I can’t help but admire the local wisdom. People followed older traditional ways that were tested and proved effective. When nothing of the past worked, they had to invent something new to solve the problems which was just as well."
"What a beautiful story, Dimitris. I am quite humbled."
Dimitri I’m so enjoying all your stories. Thank you for brightening up a dreary winter day!
"Yup, them old small communities had true sense on kinship. I've heard such stories about Jews in various countries, Georgians, Armenians, etc. Very same mode of operation.Yuri."
What another lovely story Dimitri and thank you so much for sharing :-)
Another great and amusing tale.
"Dimitris, a question:How did the Dakos ( dry bread in many variations ) culinary culture has developed?I've been told, during the Turkish raids for young and attractive boys&girls. The boys&girls were sent to the caves in the mountains. They were given dry bread and raisins - very light, but nutritious food. They could spend many days in hiding with such rations. Is it true history, or as a two bob tourist, I've been fed a fable?Yuri."
Lovely story at Christmas time. You must be so proud being a Cretan!
"Hi all and thank you for your kind words and I wish to all of our beloved members merry Christmas and Happy New Year!Yuri I don't know if this story is true.What I know about Dakos which practically is the round Paximadi (rusk) is that the idea was from Cretan women at the begining of the first millennium. In Crete, we had a lot of sheperds and seamen who neeeded it for their survival.Also, we got many attacks from pitrates and the people were forced to have ready food when they had to escape very quickly to the mountains which happened very often. At that time, the bread was produced by different seeds and was baked once in the oven but somehow it was discovered that if they baked the bread second time in the oven they got the paximadi.All water was evaporated thus achieving long-term preservation.So, this way they made bread not so often and they could have it for long time plus it weighed much less and was easier to transport.So the seamen, the sheperds, the warriors or the chased ones had this power food for long time.Nowadays, dakos is a snack made in Crete, with round paximadi soaked in some water to soften and sprinkled with oil, grated tomato and cheese topped with oregano, or dried thyme it is one of the most simple and much beloved snack for Greeks and tourists!I have a story to share a bit similar to your example. My father when he was ten years old and because he was too young and no one would suspect him, was being sent by my grandfather to the mountains to feed British agents during WW2 in 1941 and 1942. They hid in caves and their food was mainly paximadi with olives, cheese and tomatoes or other Cretan goods which were picked up by my grandfather and other families from the village."

"I've googled it alright. I knew Greeks had suffered under German/Italian/Bulgarian occupation in WWII, but never knew about Famine.Yuri."
I have just read Victoria Hislop's latest book Those who Are Loved. This gave me insight to how the Greeks suffered during the occupation and beyond. A very moving novel which was well researched.
"Here is the sad factsThe blood tax on Greece during World War II was heavy as our country is included in the top ten in absolute numbers and in the top five, worldwide, in terms of deaths as a percentage of the country's total population.More specifically, Greece, with a population of 7.22 million before the war, lost 35,100 lives on the battlefields, 171,800 of civilians associated with military actions (eg population clearances) while losses from starvation and adversity are estimated between 300,000 and 600,000. The total number amounts between half a million to 800,000 people who died during World War II. In Crete though very few people died of famine.This translates to 7- 11.17% of the country's total population before entering the war.Greece had most days of resistance, 219 and immediately after the occupation many resistance groups were formed until the end of the war.I wish after this painful lesson that everlasting peace will prevail.In my opinion, a great way to promote peace is also tourism.Tourism helps to know and understand different cultures as well as to build friendships between people of different countries.Edited: 5:18 am, December 14, 2019 "
"Dimitris K i think you are writing these posts after a Mezze and a few glasses of Raki/Tsikoudia very romantic but ancient history . As you live in Crete I would ask you to do a post on what life is like there now for the locals and the younger generation and what hopes they have for a better life other than driving a taxi or leaving Crete and seek their fortune in another land.Edited: 10:29 pm, December 15, 2019 "
"My dear Comet 27As I see you are a young man 27 years old I assume that at home you didn't learn the word respect for others, let alone your country!If you read carefully my posts after your post 63 you got all answers to your concerns about Greece.Greece got free (a part 1822) and never stop the war after that till 1973.1821-1829, 1866, 1870,1878, 1897, 1912-1914, 1918-1922, 1940-1944, 1946-1949, and dictatorship from 1967-1973. And don't forget (if you know history) that Greece was in Turkey occupation from 1453 till 1821, where many uprisings that were drowned in blood by the Turks took place.So together with my post 67 you have a picture of what happened.I'm writing all this to show that because of the difficult past Greeks had to overcome more problems than their fair share. This kept them behind in some aspects but strenthened them, too. Greeks are well equipped to overcome difficulties. The biggest majority of Greeks are not miserable.Of course Greece can be better than it is but we try for that, day to day other times with success and others not.And of course Greece is not the ruined country it is described to be. You can click at google ""development in Greece"" or so and you get an idea. I assure you that plenty smart, hard working young people are making a good life in Crete in all areas. There are difficulties but life ain't easy nowhere in the world. What we need from all Greeks from outland or Greece's friends it is support and help and not sterile and groundless criticism.I want to remind you that this is a tourist forum and not political.You tried a lot to push the topic off and I hope this is your last try!Please stop stalking me and insult me otherwise I'll report you to TA and it is not nice to see deleted posts as till now the most of your posts were on the edge.Edited: 9:21 am, December 16, 2019 "
"Comet,You're insulting people, and it isn't right. If you wish your own opinion to be respected, please learn to respect others first!Is your way of viewing things totally wrong? Not really. Nevertheless, your pessimistic approach isn't 100% correct either.Greek Economy is in shambles. Crete - being heavily dependent on subsidies from Athens, is in more difficult spot than a few other regions of Greece.On the other hand: There's no Great Depression in Greece. People aren't jumping out of the skyscrapers... Greeks in general are optimistic folks. Though, some say: they just ran out of adrenaline.Greece is a poor country, but it's not sorrow and gloom swept one. Remind you, this is travel forum. By picturing Greece/Crete in negative light, you're damaging tourism - the very thing your fellow countrymen need so much.Yuri."

"Wow, what a very informative thread, thanks for posting. Something that I've always wondered is, do the inhabitants of all the various Greek islands have a distinct identity, if that is the correct word, to one another?. Would a Cretan or Corfiot announce themselves as such or as Greek first?"
"Its customary to announce your self as Greek first to another Greek where ever you are in the world .Then where are you from a would be the next question so then you say Crete then where abouts in Crete village that could go on for half an hour depending where the village is and if some one got a cousin there LOL . If you dealing with a person from another country in another country then its I am Greek or Greek born Auzzie..They may ask wich part and that is usually that in Australia any way and leave it at that To most of them Greece is Greece. People form Cyprus usually always say they are from CyprusEdited: 7:49 pm, December 29, 2019 "
"Happy New Year to all of you!There is a perception mostly amongst foreigners but also among Greeks that the Cretans feel first Cretans and then Greeks, which is not exactly what is happening, but what is really happening is that the Cretans feel more proud of being Cretans than all other Greeks feel about the area where they were born and live. Perhaps the pride of the Cretans for their island is a world-class originality on this island with close competitors probably the Scots and Irish! There may be more examples of this kind of pride, but these were the first ones I thought of, although they are nations rather than an ethnicity group like the Cretans.Now if there is a real reason for this overwhelming pride of the Cretans, the views are divided among the Greeks but the prevailing view is that they deserve it. Crete had been cut off from the rest of the Greek kingdoms since antiquity, although it participated in most Greek wars.From the earliest years of its history it was a powerful kingdom that had prevailed throughout the Mediterranean with its powerful fleet. It had occupied Athens, which had to pay for freedom with taxes on both money and people. Each year, along with taxes, Athenians had to send seven young men and seven young women for Minotaur until he got a ""visit"" from Theseus. King Aiantas is mentioned by Homer as one of the kings who campaigned against Troia with many ships and big army. Crete is the first area where Christianity flourished peacefully. It was not until 1645 that the Turks managed to set foot on Crete after repeated efforts, although the rest of the empire had already been occupied since 1453. The island has had many demonstrations of self-sacrifice against its many conquerors and infinite myths and real stories have been born of them. During the Turkish occupation there were infinite revolutions and outbursts against the Ottomans and most of them were drowned in blood giving birth to legends and heroes. The history of the island continues with legendary struggles in the twentieth century offering many heroes who had given up their lives for their compatriots' freedom either in Macedonia at the turn of the century or in Asia Minor a bit later, or in World War II.The battle of Crete is a landmark for the bravery of the Cretans against the conquerors but also as advocates of the freedom of their homeland. Some of the Internationaily known personalities who have been born in Crete during the centuries are:ZeusOdysseus ElytisNikos KazantzakisMikis TheodorakisDominic Theotokopoulos (El Greco)So, all this and many more have shaped the Cretan untamed, free spirit of which we are characterized and which makes us very proud for a good reason or not!"
"& wishing a happy new year to everyone from me too.Thank you both for clarifying that for me with your informative replies. I think Dimitris K, your point of people thinking that Cretans feel Cretan first & then Greek hit the nail on the head for what I was wondering. As regards Cyprus, I stayed in Pathos in September & was surprised to see that there was a much bigger stock of Greek flags on sale in the huge store in the King's Arcade there than there were Cypriot flags.Edited: 10:03 am, December 30, 2019 "
Great post as always Dimitri and thanks for the fascinating insight :-)p.s. Happy New Year everyone too :-)
"Happy New Year, everybody!Health, prosperity, and Peace.Yuri."
"Kalispera So, to continue my previous post I would like to say that Cretans are a bit sensitive with their ancestry so it is good to know a thing or two of what they believe about their ancestry.Of course, there are different views on this issue but the most important is the following.Although it is widespread that the true inhabitants of Crete are blue-haired and blonde while the blacks have emerged from endogamy over the centuries with peoples who came to conquer the island, it seems to be wrong.A survey which begun between 1965 and 1996 with a significant number of Cretans from all over the island by Aris Poulianos confirms that the Cretans are indigenous to the Aegean basin.The island was inhabited during the Lower Paleolithic Era, a few million years ago, and has never been deserted since, even during the great disaster caused by the volcanic eruption of Santorini.The anthropological varieties presented on the island have their roots in the same anthropological type, the Aegean.A slightly pale coloration found among the Cretans, who are basically brunette, may be associated with the arrival of other Greek tribes from Pindos around 2,000 BC.The Cretans have hardly changed at all in for the last 6,000 years.The Cretans as a whole are above average in height .They are mostly brown with brown small eyes.Black wavy hair is the predominant hair type.And the hair on men is well developed on the chest, face and eyebrows.These traits, as well as others that emerged from the research, classify them in the Aegean Type of the southern branch of the European breed."

"KalimeraA simple example on how wrong information can cause problems. The word VRAKI is used to describe underwear mostly for children and mostly for girls. If, however it is used for teenagers or adults it is mostly to ridicule them.The real word is VRAKA and we say with special intonation mostly together with Kritikia vraka or Nisiotiki (islander) vraka."
"HiAlso in Crete when we want to honor someone we do not give him a pistol but more importantly for the Cretans an original Cretan knife that differs from all other knives around the world.There are double-edged swords and double-edged spears but no double-edged knives.A Cretan double-edged knife is made of horn or bone and stainless steel.Only in the case of a soldier can we give him a gun but not a pistol.Pistols and weapons in general are passed down from Father to son or sons or to family members.If I'm not mistaken, the mobsters and the illegal ones give each other pistols."

"HiWhile searching the internet and many magazines and asked friendsfrom the rest of the Greece, I came up with a list of the characteristics of the genuine Cretan as the rest of Greeks see us.So they say about us:When a Cretan speaks of Crete there is only but one answer.It's like asking a football fan which is the best team, but his team of course!It is as if asking a mother which is the most beautiful child!Well, you expect the same objectivity from a Cretan when you ask him which is the most beautiful island in the world.When a Cretan man talks about Crete, the only way to stop him is to say ""yes, yes, we know in Crete everything is better"".Of course there are those who spoil the name butundoubtably the Cretan is a category in itself.Cretans have a word of honor Nothing is more certain in this world than something a Cretan was committed to giving his hand. No matter what the personal cost, he stays true to his principles. Nothing is more important than walking with his head high and the forhead clean.Cretans have levendiá (closest word is bravery but not quite)If for some reason the word ""levendiá"" was lost, it could easily be replaced by the word ""Cretan"". The combination of these two basic principles - courage and sincerity - is an important goal of upbringing. And the lack of it a reason for the parents to be ashamed of their child.Cretans are hospitable.Nowhere is the world is "" feel at home"" more real than in a Cretan home/village/shop. From the simplest thing (to show you the way) to the biggest (to get out of his bed so that you sleep there) he considers it an obligation - and not a nuisance - for the stranger to feel like at his home. The treat is a commmon habit and its acceptance (whether it is food or drink) is mandatory.Cretans don't back off.He is the last person you would like to make your enemy. When he feels that he is being offended, wronged or something of his own is threatened, it is better when you are not on the enemy side. Whoever you are, no matter how many years go by, he will remember it. And be sure he will find the way (without necessarily using violence) to convince you that it would not be a good idea to repeat it.Cretans easily offendedSome things that are debatable for the rest of us, for the Cretan are non-negotiable. Especially if we are talking about principles and traditions. He will confront you if he suspects that you are going to hurt him. Because his dignity will not allow the slightest hint.Cretans consider the family sacred.He honors his parents (even after they die), he holds his wife high, would kill if he needed to for his children. At his wedding he will have 800 guests - since it is inconceivable not to invite the whole family (soy) - at celebrations his house will always be full - from brothers and sisters to uncles and aunts - and in need he will go way ...out of his way to help his relatives, even if he is a distant cousin.Cretans are generousHe's not miserable, he doesn't count the money every day, and doesn't hold the euro in his palms until he's bleeding so to speak. At home he will always do what it takes to welcome friends, relatives. Even when he is out and about and meets with somebody he knows he feels oblidged to offer him a treat. Cretans love to ""party""He knows how to enjoy life and share its joys with others. Every neighbor, passerby, or even stranger is a potential friend for ""drinking a raki"". Every occasion - whether it's a wedding, baptism or just a meeting - is a festival. In short at all times (without the need for a reason), he creates little companies with the help of mandolin/lyra or not, good wine and plenty of good mood every where."
Absolutely fantastic post Dimitri and some of those made me chuckle as they are just so true and brought back so many great memories of my experiences spending time with genuine Cretans :-)
HiThe following video is not only about Cretans but all Greeks!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzkE3bH6VLg
"HiI think it is worth adding the following link to the thread about raki/tsikoudiahttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18941…Edited: 12:26 am, February 17, 2020 "
HiAfter my last post about raki or tsikoudia I want to add the big list of mezedes that goes together with this Cretan traditional drink.I hope that you will add some that I missedPS. Notice that many main dishes we don't serve as mezedesDakosFavaKoukiaNtolmadakiaLahanontolmadakiaGemistoi anthiKeftedakiaMpekri mezeKaprikoTsitsiristoKleftikoTigania tsigariastiPatates tiganitesNtomatoftedeskolokythokeftedesSoutzoukakiaSkoti mosharisioSkoti ArnisioHohloi mpoumpouristoiApakiLoukanikoGravieraAnthotyrosFeta me riganiTzatzikiAnthogaloTyrokayteriSaganaki kefalotyriSaganaki fetaSiroto giaourtiEliesOmeletaStrapatsadaTaramosalataMelitzanosalataRosiki salataAggourontomataRapanakiAvga vrastaVolvoiToursiPanzariaKololythakia tiganitaMelitzanes tiganitesHortaManitaria tiganitapiperies oftesPiperies gelistes (feta)GigantesSkordaliaBakalaos (pastos)tiganitosGaleos tiganitosRegga pastiKalamarakiaSoupiesOktapousGarides (shrimps)MydiaGavrosSardines
Great list and Lemonato is delicious and whilst sometimes a main course it can also be found as a meze :-)
"Such mouthwatering list! It did miss our family favorite Meze: Fried aubergine rolls ( or folds ) stuffed with mozzarella&feta, baked for few minutes in well seasoned salsa. Absolutely amazing! Goes so well with chilled Retsina...I can’t remember it’s name in Greek right now, Melitsana Γεsomething...Yuri."
I am getting more hungry by the minute :-)
"More mezedes to whet your appetite!The most typical meze for Tsikoudia in Chania is kalitsounia: traditional hand made small pies filled with soft white cheese (mizithra or/and anthotyro).Or filled with spinach and/or wild greens.Most of them are fried but can be baked. The traditional kalitsouni for Easter is a square shaped, little pie, filled with mizithra, a little bit of spearmint and on top sesame and cinnamon (we bake those ones) and we eat after church ( Holy Saturday).A famous pie, perfect meze for Tsikoudia is Sfakiani Pita (Sfakian pie), a delicate round pie, like a pancake, filled with mizithra, that we serve with thyme honey!Typical meze of course is Dakos/Ntakos/ Koukouvagia: a Cretan bruschetta made with barley rusk, fresh tomatoes, olive oil, mizithra or feta and oregano.Olives: another meze for Tsikoudia can be salted (black, alatsoelies or stafidoelies) or green ones prepared with lemon or my favourite bitter orange.During spring another typical meze are fresh artichokes with lemons. A translation for Dimitri's post:Koukia: Broad beansDolmadakia: stuffed vine leaves with riceLahanodolmadakia: stuffed cabbage leaves with riceAnthi: Stuffed zucchini blossoms/flowers with riceKeftedakia:meatballsSkoti/sykoti: liverKolokythokeftedes: zucchini fritters/balls, usually with cheese and spearmintHohlioi : snails fried with rosemary and wine vinegarApaki: smoked pork meatLoukanika: sausagesMelitzanosalata: eggplant saladVolvi: pickled bulbsPantzaria: beetroot.Last, but not least(!) is Staka, or Staka with eggs, although I wouldn't serve with Raki, but you have to taste it, also for breakfast."
"HiYes goanjock, Lemonato with oregano it is fantastic meze and main dish!Yuri probably you mean Melitzana gemisti rollo.Yes it is fantastic taste!Edited: 2:58 pm, February 22, 2020 "
Great additions to the list Elena :-)
"HiThank you Elena, your contribution is fantastic!By the way, what you call in Chania area staka it is something different in Heraklion and especially in Malevizi area.We add in the boiling xygalo (it is a type of creme cheese) barley flour and we stir it until the butter starts coming up.When the butter stops coming up the staka is ready.We eat it just like that or spread in bread or paximadi.Probably what you call in Chania staka is anthogalo with some eggs fried with a bit of olive oil which we stir them till they get a golden colour. It is a sort of power breakfast."

"Melitzana Gemisti Rollo it is indeed. Fantastic dish. I’ve tried to cook it at home. It came out tasty alright, but not as tasty as the Cretan version. I think it’s because of your fine tomatoes, and very freshly dried herbs. Our Bal’adi aubergines are just as good as yours, but our dried herbs are not as good. Next time, I’ll try to use fresh greens. It’ll be totally different dish, but it’ll be tasty for certain.Another fantastic Greek/Cretan starter: Makrides - Greek Whitebait. It’s not as heavily battered as British Whitebait, therefore less soggy with oil. It’s very much like our fried fish, but the quality of the fish is absolutely outstanding. Lemon juice from the half of a lemon over the plate, and a bottle of Raki. As David Coverdale sings: “Here I go again...”Yuri."
That's interesting about the names. It has never crossed my mind that there were certain surnames that might be more prevalent in one island than in others. How has that come about? Is it down to saints being associated with specific islands or just passed down through families over generations?
Hi YuriYou drive me mad till I found out that the fish you named as Makrides is the Marides or often maridaki the small one.
"Hi GaildorfbluesIt is the tradition parents to give their children the names of their parents with priority over men.Of course there are many variants as the names sometimes coincide.Now the next looks like tongue twisterSo I have my grandfather's name from my father, my youngest brother my grandmother's big brother's name because my mother's father has the same name as my father and it is forbidden to have father and son with the same name and my sister's name is my father's mother's name.Sometimes the godmother takes the responsibility of the name and that way families enrich the families names."
So sorry. I don’t know how κ got into it. Marides! Greek Whitebait.Yuri.
"Hi YuriAt the truth is my mistake as I don't search ""whitebait"" but ""makrides"" which is a surname from north Greece and if put out the later m left akrides who means crickets :-)"
"Hello Dimitris!The Mezedes accentuation this thread has received is most relevant to us all these days. Since scientists have announced that certain level of alcohol in blood is a good preventative measure against Corona virus, every night I’m working on my health in highly devoted manner. Serious drinking requires proper Mezedes!Yuri."
ΗιIt is a tradition all over Greece and in Crete as well. Of course there is the occassional exception.Also if a husband dies while his wife is pregnant the child it is tradition to get the name of the dead father.
More great posts and really interesting information. Yuri you keep working on that preventative measure and enjoy the mezedes :-))
HiFor those who want to have Crete with them all the timeradio.garden/listen/kritikosfm/dLioOKjD
"What else I can do?I was supposed to fly to Manchester today, for The Who concert tomorrow...Main question today remains: Is this Coronavirus just another flu? In that case, it’ll pass when Summer heat will arrive. We all shall enjoy most wonderful holiday season ever... What if it’s not?Yuri."
Ηi YuriThe whole point is to stay healthy so that you enjoy as many concerts of Who you wish in the future!The Coronavirus will do what Coronavirus does and we will do what it takes to stay healthy.The quarantine will be over soon and we will enjoy life again with the added bonus of appreciation. If it comes again we will fight again but I refuse to mess my mind with speculations.
"Hi Dimitris,The Who concert seems so irrelevant now. We're in lockdown, counting deaths. 44 in Israel by now.I talked on the phone to the hotel owner in Pelion. According to him ( Vasilis ), Greek government has reassured Greek citizens that present Coronavirus crisis will be over soon, and life will get back to normal by second half of May. Is that so indeed?Yuri."
"Hi YuriAlthough there is order the hotels and let rooms stay close till end of May looks like that can be changed.Now we have lockdown till 27 April and there are many possibilities after that by the end of this period, they will start announcing the counter-escalation measures.I am not sure if we are ready to call our visitors middle May but exists a very small possibility!"
"Dimitris,Also I’ve been told that in order to save whatever in possible from Summer season, Greek government will differentiate tourism on the basis of countries of origin. Tourists from the countries contaminated by the virus won’t be allowed, and tourists from “clean” countries will be welcomed.Sounds very strange to me. Have there been any talks/discussions of the kind in Greek media?Thank you very much.Yuri"
"Hi YuriThere were some voices at the beginning of the crisis that said so, but it was quickly forgotten. Now Greek scientists are working with foreigners but also with an American group and are trying to prove a quick test but not only fast but also reliable. Yesterday they presented some results that are satisfactory but said that by the end of April they will have developed it much more with very good results.The idea is that anyway if someone wants to travel immediately after the crisis he will do a test on his own to be sure that he will enjoy his vacation and as soon as he arrives at the Greek airports he will have another one that will last no more than 15 minutes.Of course it's an idea and no one is sure what will happen in Greece or aboad till the end of April."
"Dimitris - you will recall I asked you several days ago which the 'clean countries' were. I see you now say this idea has now been dropped. Visitors to test themselves, then tests administered at Greek airports taking 15 minutes. What happens to these people who fail this test ? This really is speculation of course'. I consider the whole process unlikely, but we will see. Your optimism remains, but realism will endure."
"Dimitris,How many tests are Greeks producing per day today?Here in Israel we’re producing about 9k. Our Ministry of Health has been heavily ( and rightfully ) criticized. They were supposed to reach the 20k per day limit.UK are doing extremely bad, about 8k tests per day only.Please tell our regards to your lovely family.Keep safe! Drink Raki!Yuri."
"Dimitris - tonight I've found the following. Your previous comment about allowing visitors from 'clean countries'.The 18 countries without Covid-19Comoros; Kiribati; Lesotho; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; North Korea; Palau; Samoa; Sao Tome and Principe; Solomon Islands; South Sudan; Tajikistan; Tonga; Turkmenistan; Tuvalu; Vanuatu, Yemen"
Michael. I went through this thread thoroughly. I didn’t see any Dimitris’s post about “clean countries”.Have you had this discussion with Dimitris in some other thread?Yuri.
D will point you to it
"Kalimera Michael, (M) I think you are mistaken!You forgot AntarcticaEdited: 2:48 am, April 05, 2020 "
Hahaha Elena good point :-)
"Elena and goanjock - 0h how hilarious. Actually, you'll find Antarctica is a continent not a country. Sorry my factual input fell on stony and uneducated ground.I was trying to point out the futility of considering 'clean countries' being able to visit Crete, as suggested a few days ago by D"
"Michael.Let’s not take umbrage over nothing. It was me who’s brought the matter of “clean countries” up. I was amazed to hear about such attitude from the hotel owner in Agios Ioannis, Pelion and wanted to hear another local’s opinion.Yesterday has been most difficult day for your country. 708 death in one day. We all feel for you.Let’s stick to pragmatic scenarios, without taking unnecessary offense. We can speculate about how clean/dirty corona wise UK is or will be, but it won’t do anyone any good.Yuri."
"YuriI - seems D has not assisted with your comment re him mentioning 'clean countries' being allowed into Crete. It was #402 on the other CV thread. You will note incremental and unrealistic expectations from him concerning Crete opening its borders - it started with end of April, then end of May, now end of June. I always hope he is right, but realism suggests otherwise."
"#193 YuriU - just seen your post above , after my #194. Just trying to answer your previous question. Thank you for your response above, agreed."
"Michael, do you think that it's the right time for us to loose our sense of humour?Of course we know geography!"
"It's too early to judge and to make decisions.Nobody knows when and how this madness will end? At what cost? What the political situation, finance, air carriers, etc, etc, etc shall be?I've got one trip cancelled by now. I'm not counting on second half of July in Yorkshire Dales to go through either. Beginning of August in Pelion - seems very vague right now.For now, we just need to stay put and wait.Yuri."
"Good morning YuriIt seems that Greece is following a different path to tackle covid19 from other countries.The committee has decided that mass tests on the general population are not helping at this stage, as it would not be possible to limit a large part of the population in a COMPLETE way, thus only molecular tests are done only where there is a reason.As in those who have clear symptoms, in those who belong to the vulnerable group, in those who have contacts who are positive, in those who come from another country, and in the health professionals.At this stage, someone with mild symptoms can also take the test today, but it come out negative and if taken again the day after it can come out positive. About 19500 molecular tests have been performed and 1673 tests have been positive, of which about 250 are from two ships that came from Turkey and many others from repatriated Greeks from European countries and Turkey and especially from Istanbul.As soon as we move on to the third phase of the de-escalation of the measures, the committee has decided to do mass antibody tests to see the percentage of immunity in the community.The majority of the population in Greece obeys the measures and it seems that a large part of the population has the virus without symptoms or with light symptoms but without transmitting it to the vulnerable groups which is the group we want to protect.A separate research with antibody tests is been done and although the publications will be few until it is completed, if they have the desired result it will be published later with the completion of the third phase.I hope things will continue to go well and other countries will find their way into the fight against the virus.Many greetings also to your loved ones!"
Ive read Dimitris comments on clean countries. All he said was these were comments from some Scientists not set in stone and could be later.
Just had an EMail from Easyjet. You can now book holidays all the way to October 21. Clearly anticipating all the cancellations this year.
"What's new? The EasyJet have pumped the prices up in most dispeakable manner, while offering free rescheduling of the flights. I've ended up paying extra money for flights in October, I'm not certain I want.Yuri."

"Michael, of course it was a terrible mistake and police rescinded that soon, I am sure about that. Policemans are human beings, make mistakes, sometimes tragic."

"I repostHiToday at 18:00 in covid19 daily updateToday the briefing was presented by a representative of the Ministry of Health and from tomorrow it will again be made by Mr. Tsiodras and other members of the committee responsible for the covid 19.The situation has not changed since yesterday, we have performed 25.000 molecular tests and we have 62 new cases confirmed and all together 1735 cases, 93 ICU intubated and 73 deaths.For those who have not been informed, after a few days the quarantine was imposed, the government decided that the offenders who will be outside for no reason (after making very specific the cases where the community can go out) will be fined 150 euros.About 20.048 fines of 150euro have been imposed, as well as some larger ones in businesses that are open when they should be closed.Anyone who believes that they have been mistakenly fined by the authorities, they may file an objection to the District Police Commander within three days, either email or by fax.The police gave a fine by mitstake to homelees man but after while it was deleted.With this opportunity the gov looks to to find places ( hotels or institutions) for the homeless to stay for this period.Edited: 12:23 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Hi allBecause of the covid 19 Cretans offer tons of tsikoudia for alcohol productionGiven the great needs for disinfectants and antiseptics, the Association of Traditional Distillers of the Prefecture of Heraklion, proceeded with a commendable move with 4 to 5 tons of tsikoudia that can be used for the production of alcohol and disinfectants.In order to allocate this large amount, the Association has informed the competent ministries which will come to an agreement with the local authorities.""Tsikoudia is the basis for alcohol, it is a process very close to alcohol. Our country needs basic necessities and imports from third countries. It does not exist and is in great short supply. We have proposed to donate a quantity. Official response from the state hasn't been issued, yet but we know that they are positive. We are waiting. All producers are anxious and responded immediately, there are many phone calls for the partitipation to offer tsikoudia.We are waiting for the final decision from the competent authorities. Once approved, we will have collected the desired amount in two or three days. """
Xristos Anesti In Greece we replace Kalimera with Xristos Anesti from the Easter Sunday and the next 40 days.Of course it is difficult to keep up with this for a long time but it is worth sharing this information because it shows how deeply rooted in every day life was the Ressurection of Christ!
"Good EveningToday, May 17th, is a day in May that is completely different from what I remember all my life here or abroad.In the winter, when we heard about the virus in China, all Cretans were informed with interest what was happening in China, and they supported Chinese from distancmost , but some with some small or larger donations.Nobody expected then that the virus would knock on our door and in a harder way Europe and less our country.Less our country, thanks to the Prime Minister who comes from Crete who quickly took very strict measures and so we were saved from the worst.Of course, the economic consequences in the country after 10 years of economic crisis due to debt accumulation are big.In recent years, tourism has been growing and all indications were that 2020 would be the best of all time, which is why new investments and preparations for this year had been taken place on incredible proportions.Until February, the atmosphere in the country and especially on our island of Crete was festive and the smiles were generously distributed to everyone.Unfortunately, the virus came and hit us mercilessly.Now the virus is slowly leaving (maybe coming back in the future) and humanity is rejuvenating!Cretans, be sure that they will do everything to assure that you have good holiday and safely.We hope you will set aside all of your suspensions and visit us.Many people say that in Crete, despite all the adversity, we will be safer, even if there is an outbreak of the virus, and this is not a lie.I can write you a lot more in favor but I will end with one big welcome!!!"

Great Post Dimitri.Congratulations!I would like to add how proud we are about our doctors and their laudable efforts (although the cases in Crete were only 16)But our doctors and generally the hospitals are doing their best..

"Good to hear Dimitris and looking forward to enjoying more Cretan culture , food and wonderful hospitality in 2 weeks time . I wish the island all the best for summer 2020 .Edited: 7:53 am, July 11, 2020 "
With the increase of corona virus the Cretans will be under severe pressure. We wish them well. https:/…bid-to-prevent-surge-in-covid-cases
Thank you DamnoniI must add that the previous post refer to north Greece and the border with Bulgaria.I hope that we don't start in this topic a new argument about c19.There are already plenty of them.Thank you.
Thank you Lucy Lane for that . I found the final paragraph the most interesting
Unfortunately Covid-19 is the elephant in the room at the moment.
#229.. Thanks Dimitri. I'll drink to that
"#229Much nicer to talk about Dakos or Kaltsounia I think Dimitris !Edited: 8:26 am, July 11, 2020 "
Absolutely!I spend today my morning by calling my friends all around Crete and asking them about the situation in their area.All of them plus minus have good news and I got invited to visit them!Now I must plan how to make this happen!Next weeks I have to consume a lot of ntakos kaltsounia and others Cretan delicacy!It would be nice if some of you can follow me!
Dimitri. Fingers still crossed for September! :-))
Thanks for the update Dimitri :-)
#234That is my idea of heaven Dimitris - driving around Crete visiting old friends and enjoying plenty of local delicacies !
"Yes, I believe it too that the heaven on earth is in Crete!And we can still enjoy it!"
Crete certainly is God's other country Dimitri ;-) hahahahaha :-)

"I think we will have a Cretan feast next weekend Dimitris and raise our glasses to happy memories, future memories still to be made and our many Cretan friends :-))"
"Have a good night with your family and friends!Today, July 12, was one of the few times in my life that I enjoyed the heavy traffic from Heraklion to Chania!I did not believe it either but the enjoyment was real.I made a stop in Panormos for a Greek coffee, and as I enjoyed it I heard a thunderous voice from an old Cretan "" Where are you from young man ?I laughed with all my heart since you don't call me young and I answered him from the ""big town"" but you probably forgot your glasses!!!And he answered me '"" I am close to 95 and I see you all young hahahaha""""""'And are you a tourist ?"", he asks me, ""but probably not because your accent is Cretan"".And he continues ... Fortunately, a lot of tourists came in the last few days and we saw something else because we got bored with each other and we started to quarrel with each other so much more often to pass the time.We even said various things with the old man and then I continued on my way to Chania, smiling all the way, remembering the old man's words!"
Brilliant story Dimitri and thanks so much for sharing. It's made me smile too :-))
"Just about now the funeral is taking place in Heraklion of Nikos Malliarakis. Nikos is much better known to Cretans and visitors as ""Nick the Greek""From the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s Nick owned Studio Disco and Nightclub in Agios Nikolaos. Studio started out in the open air at Ammoudi beach(where Club Ammoudi is now located). It was not a disco/nightclub in the normal sense in those early days, Apart from modern dance there would be a display of traditional Cretan and Greek dancing each night by a fully costumed troop. Then Nick would sing traditional Cretan folk songs.Studio moved into a building on the harbour(close to where Puerto Bar is now) and operated there till the mid 1990s. Nick then took up olive farming and has lived in Pachia Ammos(the village where the roads from Sitia, Iereptra and Agios Nikolaos all meet) in recent years.Apart from his disco exploits Nick was famous for the large motor bike he rode. It was a 900cc Kawasaki when the typical motor bike in town was a Honda 50Nick died on Sunday. He was 89. He appears to have fallen from the balcony of his house and was dead when some friends found him. They had become worried when he wasn't answering his phone.There are links below about Nick and his times. You need to scroll through the Facebook one as the posting about Nick are interspersed.A light of a vibrant Crete has gone outanatolh.com/2020/…https://www.facebook.com/groups/8929599435/"
"Thank you so much W914SG for the post and all the info about Nikos... Nick the Greek...., he was very loved in Agios, and a true legend too.Thank you also for the links...how wonderful , loved the video :-) and especially to see him playing with my very good friend Ross M and looks like Pera Banda too."
"Hi allToday, July 18, eighteenth day that tourism has opened.Slowly slowly even a few tourists have arrived in the smallest parts of Crete.Many smiles on the faces of Cretans.It is a blessing that they are so welcome and that in their own way the Cretans show it to them!Fortunately, the cases are only 37 from the beginning of the opening, on the first of July, although we expected much more. In any case, we are also prepared for much more because the health of the Cretans and the visitors is equally important!Only two of these cases ended up in the hospital where today the examinations were very good and they are ready for release.Most of the tourism companies have opened and every day more are added to the action.Those hotels that will not open at all, have made agreement with others to cover their customers.Because the number of visitors has increased dramatically, which has made Greeks in every corner of the country very happy, the committee has decided in the places most frequented by Greeks and visitors, it would be wiser if everyone wore a mask for obvious reasons.In case of the super markets the use of mask is mandatory for workers and clients.Personally, all those close to me use a plastic mask for the whole face that is not at all annoying.After all, the cost is very small compared to the comfort it offers.More flights are added every day and the opening of the British market has made a big difference.I wish all visitors a happy holiday !!!"
Thanks for the update from a Cretan's perspective and I am sure most forum readers will appreciate your thoughts.
Hi allAll the tests on British tourists from the last three days were negative. https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.naftemporiki.…
More great news and I am getting more positive feedback from UK travelers and also the warm welcome they receiving from Cretans when they arrive and travel round the island. Thanks for the update Dimitri.
<< All the tests on British tourists from the last three days were negative.>> That’s brilliant news....but there’s three more months yet left of the season.......fingers crossed the good news continues for the tourists and the locals

"Good EveningA month passed and more than half a million (500.000) tourists came to Crete in addition to the Greek tourists from Mainland Greece.It was a worldwide success since during all this time only 42 positive cases were found throughout Crete after a very good thorough control.The most wonderful thing in the whole island is the way the Cretans welcomed the Greek and foreign tourists.There were small or larger celebrations all over Crete and above all no one got the impression that he is undesirable!August seems to be a much better month and in many hotels the occupancy will be extremely satisfactory.In general, the island has a climate of optimism that seems to be justified since the tourists who come are more and more and have exceeded our expectations!It is worth saying once again welcome!Edited: 4:55 pm, July 27, 2020 "
