"Another glorious morning looking out over the Pacific Ocean from our balcony. One of the huge advantages of PB Sunset Beach is that virtually every single suite has an incredible view of the Pacific Ocean. Every morning we get to watch all the fishing boats go out. Usually at least a couple of times a week from October - March, we get to watch cruise ships go by as well. Yep, it's a tough life.The ladies went to church yesterday morning and it was a nice service. In the large court yard ouside the resorts chapel, they had a DÃ­a de los Muertos display/contest. Maybe 8 or more different tribute's that were voted on for the best one. After church, we all went down to La Nao for the Champagne Brunch and had a nice breakfast. They put out a large spread but it's not really something I'd regularly (or typically) pay @ $35 for. I think that's what it costs. We did it for the first time maybe 10 years ago and hadn't returned since. Mostly because we would make our own breakfast in our timeshare. Plus if I'm going out for breakfast, I'm more of a Denny's or IHOP kind of guy and for about $15 or less I'm completly stuffed. We did it again yesterday just because it's included in the AI Meal Plan.No lunch necessary because of the late brunch. Had dinner at Sunsets & Sushi over by the building 17 pool. Had an excellent dinner. For those who don't like raw fish, not to worry. They have other options as well. I had a salad with teriyaki chicken, greens, cucumbers, mandarine oranges, cashews and onions. For the main course, I had a grilled, marinated teriyaki flank/skirt steak, grilled broccoli and roasted potatoes. I also tried a sushi roll with avocado and teriyaki chicken (my first sushi roll). It was all great. There is even a burger available for those who want less exotic fare. My wife had a salad, the grilled salmon entee (loved it), and also tried my sushi roll. Our good friend Vicki had a salad, sashimi (the real raw fish) and a sushi roll. Vicki doesn't like her sashimi with the sauses that are typically paired with the fish but they had absolutely no qualms serving the sashimi naked. Maybe 10 pieces on the plate. They had several selections of fish and had no problem just giving her a variety plate. She reported it was excellent. At the end - all our plates were clean so I guess that's an indicator of our enjoyment. After dinner, we walked up to the lobby bar for a couple of drinks.The new Taqueria on the other side of the pool was also open. Quite a variety of taco's offered and they are sold individually so you can mix and match to your hearts content. We will try to get there sometime this week. Vicki is doing an owner's update presentation to get some questions answered regarding the points system she is on. She will get $400 in resort credits so we will use that for the Quivera Steakhouse at least once. $35 upcharge on the AI for dinner so we will burn through $105 of her resort credit that night. We will either repeat that again (if good) or she can use the rest at the spa.Today, we get to move to our favorite building. Porters will do most of the work. Building 17 is still a great location but we have our favorite so that's where we are going. Breakfast this morning (and probably the rest of the week) wil be at the Bistro. Just too much temptation to overeat at the buffet down at La Nao. Lunch will be by the pool. We'll decide on dinner later. Dang, this paradise stuff is tough."
We 're headed there in a couple of weeks. Which bldg is your favorite? Have you heard anything about an epidemic of stomach illness hitting the resort?
"A favorite for one might be the worst for another. I will tell you our second favorite is the building 17/18 Complex because it has a regular pool and an adult quiet pool. Some people like to be right on the beach. Others - near the main pool. Still others, in the high rises close to the sky pool. There is no perfect building because they are pretty much all great. I can tell you some people try to avoid the ground floor or second floor because if they are extremely light sleepers then the golf carts going by might cause an issue for a very sensitive sleeper. But an advantage to the lower floors means not having to wait for an elevator.Hope you have a great trip. So far this week, the weather has been absolutely perfect."
People will tell you there is no stomach bug going around but my wife and I would disagree. We are at the Rose' and came down with the bug on Saturday. Thank god for us it only lasted a day and only hampered s from going out to dinner.
"TopSully...... We like bldg 40/41. Its half way from the main pool and the La Nao restaurant at the beach, and the main lobby at the higher part of the resort. It has its own pool which is usually very quiet. All the pools have food and drink service."
How has the new cart route been? We are going to be there the first week of December a group of 8 and worried about long waits for the carts. Sounds like your having fun wish I was there now!
"We are here now and personally I think the new cart route is working well (for us anyway). We haven't used the carts but a few times but no real problems encountered. I think the advantage is that the cart routes are there own complete path (all include a run to the lobby area and also the main pool). With a specific closed loop route - the carts can run in a continuous manner within their loop. In the past, it was possible for one area to be overloaded with cart calls leaving the rest of the resort waiting. There are maps posted all over the resort showing the routes for the 3 circuits. It's possible you might have to do a transfer (think bus/subway) to get to some locations but it would not be the norm. There are also a select few unrestricted carts (no color stripes) that can go anywhere. So those might be useful for someone in building 1, etc. to call for a cart and go from the beach to the skypool in one trip (no transfer). But because those carts are few, the wait might be longer."
Excellent info! TFS!
"Hey Rocky - not real quiet right now. Not terrible, but not quiet. A new twin set of buildings is being built right behind 40/41. It's in the final stages (basic structure is complete), but construction noise was going by 7:30 this morning. So some hammering and pnumatic tools evident. So any buildings over in that area - buildings 26/27, 40/41, etc (north side of the resort is going to hear it). Not a problem for us - in comming here for the last 13 years, we are pretty much used to it. Some years none, some years some."
"SD PADREGlad you are having a great time. I'm enjoying the live feed. We will arrive on Sunday. So you (or anyone that has been there recently) may be able to tell me what cookware they have in the 1 bedroom. We will be eating in some, eating at the resort some and eating in town some. Any info would be appreciated."
"Really, the only thing you will want for is an oven for baking brownies or cookies. Electric cooktop, microwave oven, coffee maker (with filters provided), toaster, blender, silverware, pots, pans, containers, dishes, glassware, etc. This is for Sunset Beach - should be fairly identical for PB Rose & PB Blanco. Ice cube trays in the freezer. Make ice cubes as first order of business. Ice machines in each building but not always working. We use one of the plastic bowls to dump ice cubes in (kept in freezer) and keep making ice cubes until we've built up a supply."
"Note that the Rose & Blanco don't have ice machines. Take the ice bucket down to the bar and ask the bartender to fill it for you. There are ice cube trays, but the freezer space is small.Something that the mini-kitchen includes that may surprise you is a lime squeezer. I always bring a small paring knife with me."
"One other thing I forgot to mention is Salt & Pepper. Rarely provided in the rooms. It's a tourist gotcha item in the grocery stores (read expensive, unless you want 2 pounds of salt). We always bring one of the little picnic packs with us (salt & pepper twin pack)."
"Salt & pepper in my Blanco room last week, but I can't remember if it's in Rose rooms."
"Did you actually use it or just see the salt and pepper shakers. In 13 years, we've probably had actual salt and pepper in those shakers only a few times. Would be nice if they started stocking them. Ours are empty this time again."
"I don't use salt & pepper, but these were glass shakers with visible product. Fresh? Probably not. I remember purchasing salt & pepper during a Cabo trip a few years ago. So I probably wouldn't count on seeing any in the cupboard."
SDPadreThanks for the kitchen info and ice cube plan. Good idea. I take a few spices along with salt and pepper along on travels where we have a kitchen so will follow suit this time also.PacificNWWe will be at Sunset so hopefully ice machines if needed. The paring knife suggestions is good. I usually take one but forgot to put it on my list this time. Thanks.
"Spadre, we've been here a month and think the cart system is an improvement.Finally the waves were calm enough (glass and 83 degree water) to swim at Pedregal, as they were again this morning. Perfect.We, and friends who've joined us, love this place.I would never do AI again ,but the 10 days we did were fun, in between the overeating discomfort and too much alcohol crumminess."
