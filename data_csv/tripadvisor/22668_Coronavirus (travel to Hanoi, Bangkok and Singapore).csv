"Hello. My husband and I (both healthy adults in our mid-30s) have an upcoming trip to Hanoi, Bangkok and Sinagpore second week of February. All of our flights and hotels are non-refundable. We already bought face masks, hand santitizers and disinfecting wipes to bring with us. Our travel insurance doesn't cover for epidemics so we can either: 1) be risky, go, and try to enjoy the best of it or; 2) not go, eat the costs, and weep at home. We're leaning towards being risky and enjoy.My question is: How is it actually there in Hanoi? Are we good as long as we practice basic hygiene (mask, wash hands, etc.)? We've been watching the news alot and I don't know how much of the media we should believe! There's already 5 confirmed cases in U.S. so we think it's inevitable and the same wherever we go now."

"Thanks.I just wanted to get a basic idea of how the atmosphere is by people who are currently living there.If everyone there's also practicing basic hygiene and going about their daily lives, then I'm game. If even the locals were panicking and closing up shop, etc., then would def reconsider the trip. As of now, sounds a-ok to me!"
"We are in the same boat, schedule for a 2 weeks trip to Vietnam via Beijing airport at the end of February. Not sure what to do."
We have held off booking our flights for our end of April trip to China and Hanoi.Our son works as a teacher in Tianjin. Typical mom I wrote “wear a mask and keep washing your hands”He replied “will do!”For now all we can do is keep following the news.
I am leaving for Hanoi February 13.It is a concern but if you practice good hygiene all should be ok.
Who knows if the epidemic will worsen or soon be over. We can only follow the latest news and too me it sounds as if it will get worse. We are also booked to go to Vietnam and right now we have no plans to cancel our trip
"@border39 I just saw an article saying some major domestic airlines are offering changes to flights to Beijing at no cost. Hopefully that helps you!To everyone else, thank you! As of now, we are sticking with our flights and hotels :)"
Go have a good time but take care. You have just as much risk if not more the moment you enter your airport.
"I have been in Bangkok for past 3 weeks.. so a few things.. pollution in Bangkok has been bad for the past month and so majority of people wear masks anyway.. last week with a few billion Chinese on the move for Chinese NY had probably 90 of people wearing masks.. many chemists have sold out of masks adn reality is unless you have the right type of mask they are essentially useless if you are worried about Coronavirus. Practice good hygenie, have dettol handwipes and spray and just keep slapping it on your hands throughout the day. Hanoi - no one is really wearing masks excep the Chinese here.. but again.. I dont see any real issue as long as you keep high hygiene levels.. Im personally more concerned in the airports and on planes where the same air is being recylcled and there are millions caught in the one building... just keep wiping and cleansing I say.. but that being said.. Chinese NY has more Chinese on the move throughout the world than any other time of year.. who knows whos go it and where they are.. you can only do the best you can.."
We are travelling to hanoi on 15th feb from london just waiting to see what happens the decision might be taken away if advice is to not go. But we intend going and just be hygiene aware
"** Hanoi - no one is really wearing masks excep the Chinese here.. but again.. I dont see any real issue as long as you keep high hygiene levels.. Im personally more concerned in the airports and on planes where the same air is being recylcled and there are millions caught in the one building.**Having been in Hanoi airport very recently practically everyone, including all staff were wearing masks. Cabin crew wore them throughout our entire flight. We also saw a lot of people in Hanoi itself wearing masks, not just Chinese."
Take a mask if you feel unsafe but do wear it at airport and on flight especialy.I'd be more concerned about Dengue fever from mosquito's
Latest report from Vietnam's Ministry of health. https://vietnamnews.vn/society/591638/first-…
"I am getting refund for the flight from my travel agency but Air China is not offering any other option like not going through Beijing. I had booked open jaw ticket NY- PKK-SGN, coming back from Hanoi."
Can u go vai manila phillipines just an idea.
"We are going 11 Feb with Titan, tour of Vietnam, concerned but government will stop flights if it’s not safe i think we just have to be sensible, hand sanitizer etc"

I'm in Hanoi right now. Some of the locals are wearing masks in the tourist locations where there are a lot of people and lots of Chinese tourists. Everything is business as usual. I'm pretty careful and I don't feel worried at all here. I will try to buy some masks today for our flights and for areas that are filled with visitors.
"""My husband and I (both healthy adults in our mid-30s) "" Maybe you want to read this report about a US man in his mid 30s who got it. He ended up with pneumonia on the ninth day of his illness. He had no underlying health issues. He is fine after 8 days in the hospital, but I don't think being a healthy person is necessarily going to mean it will be mild. Also, the way it describes is that even when people start showing symptoms they may not seek help because they appear mild. This could be leading to under reporting of the actual numbers, because people are just assuming its a cold. Also, ""We already bought face masks, hand santitizers and disinfecting wipes to bring with us."" I'm pretty sure people in China are frantically doing this and yet it is still spreading. Not sure we have an adequate sense of how effective these precautions are yet. Not saying don't do that stuff but also be aware that it may not be as effective at prevention as you like.I really wanted to go to Vietnam in February but decided against it. It bothers me how low the vietnam numbers are in comparison to other places in the region singapore/bangkok/japan.I don't think the numbers are as low as they are reporting. In 2 to 3 weeks I think we will know how much it will spread to vietnam. https:/…index.html"

Hi. It's not serious as you think. There are 5 people in Vn is stayed with corona and they are getting well. Just aware and equip by face mask and gel to clean the hand. Its ok.
"Vietnam there really is no problem mainly because Chinese people don't see it as a holiday/travel destination compared to other asian countries. But yes people are paranoid about it but normal vietnamese are going about their business as usual. I would not fly through China though at the moment. Most countries are banning flights from China and yes at airports around asia there a lot of masks being worn. China is in lock down at the moment.Singspore is different as well, mainland Chinese are the majority of their tourists. They outnumbered any other group by 100. However they have a great health care system but there are still risks.Masks wont save you anyway, you will still contract the virus through airborn particles. To be honest tourists wearing them look silly and paranoid because they don't understand how viruses spread.Edited: 11:13 am, February 01, 2020 "
"I'd avoid Asia altogether right now, this virus is the real thing.Some media outlets are urging us to not worry, but from what I'm readying today this is wrong. You need to consider carefully whether or not you want to proceed with this trip. Please see this article:https:/…"
"We been here since 19 th of January.People do wear masks no matter what here due to the pollution.We took a trip two days ago 21 people on the boat, enjoyed.There seems no Chinese.China travel restricted. Someone already here’s different matters.It’s your decision. But feeling safe.We will take walking tour today in very small group."
I’m in the same predicament... NCL Jade?
"No risk in Vietnam ; A few CHINESE tourists arrived sick from Wuhan and are hospitalized ; no deaths. Moreover, the Viet government has forbidden all flights between Vietnam and China since yesterday. Once again, the infernal media and their panicky announcements are winning !!!!"
"Update for you - until now (2nd Feb): Hanoi is still fine, no risk at all. We are Hanoian, we just need avoid crowd, and wear face mask regularly. I am in the Old quarter also and I still feel safe in my daily life. All the tours still go on also.Maybe because almost of the flights seem to be cancelled, last night all the Chinese/Taiwan/Hongkong came back home already."
"> No risk in VietnamThat's pretty irresponsible. Actually COMPLETELY irresponsible. The risk may be low, but to say there is NO risk is just [put your own word here]https://moh.gov.vn/Cập nhật lúc 17h00 ngày 2-2-2020:- Thế giới: 14.636 người mắc, 305 người tử vong, trong đó Trung Quốc 304 người tử vong, Phillippines có 01 trường hợp tử vong.- Việt Nam: 07 người mắc nCoV. Trong đó: 02 cha con người Trung Quốc (01 người đã khỏi); 03 công dân Việt Nam đều trở về từ Vũ Hán, Trung Quốc; 01 công dân Việt Nam là lễ tân có tiếp xúc gần với 2 cha con người Trung Quốc; 01 công dân Mỹ đến Việt Nam, trước đó có quá cảnh tại Vũ Hán, Trung Quốc.~Updated at 17:00 on February 2, 2020:- The world: 14,636 cases, 305 deaths, of which China 304 die, 01 in the Philippines.- Vietnam: 07 people have nCoV. Of which: 02 Chinese father and son (01 has recovered); 03 Vietnamese citizens have returned from Wuhan, China; 01 Vietnamese citizen is a receptionist who has close contact with 2 Chinese father and son; 01 US citizen came to Vietnam, previously in transit in Wuhan, China.The US citizen apparently transited through Wuhan on 15 Jan (seen reported elsewhere - I haven't seen that date confirmed). So i guess s/he has been wandering about in Vietnam possibly infecting others before showing symptoms.There is certainly NOT ""No risk"" . Nobody knows yet what level the risk is. But to announce confidently that there is ""No risk""? I shake my head."
"I just cancelled my flight. It was a hard decision, but I have a friend who has family and friends in Hanoi, and they all advised me not to go. Apparently, Vietnam has not banned the flights from Macau and HK. I was going to Hanoi, too close to China! There have been new cases, and we don’t know if there’s more.. Plus, I dont’t think I will be able to enjoy my vacation if I’m constantly thinking about getting the virus. I’d rather be safe than sorry. I can go back some other time."
"Plus, I dont’t think I will be able to enjoy my vacation if I’m constantly thinking about getting the virus. =========Agree with you; mental stress is worst than actual virus! I got alert by Cathay Pacific on Feb 1st....aviation authorities in Vietnam ordered canceling all HK flights to Vietnam for one day and refunds, rebooking accordingly. I am taking via CP in next two weeks and hopefully alright.Edited: 3:51 pm, February 02, 2020 "
Right now we are in Hanoi Since 31st Jan. You can continue your Trip in Vietnam at least with all proper precaution. We stayed yesterday at Halong cruise and absolutely enjoyed without being much of fear.
"9 cases in Vietnam as of today, including 4 Vietnamese. Out of the 9, 8 were on the same flight originated from Wuhan, and this out of 97 million people + tens of thousands of Occidental tourists. One of the Vietnamese is from a province west of Hanoi and is taken care of in a Hanoi hospital ; no case in Hanoi itself. Besides, all flights between China and Vietnam are banned since 1 February. The risk is extremely minimal in the country."
"saket, was it crowded in Halong Bay? I meant a lot of tourists, big buses?Edited: 4:15 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"Here's a fun exercise:- make a list of all illnesses you can catch in Vietnam- order that list with the most dangerous (highest chance of contracting illness) at the top, to the least dangerous.- scroll down to the bottom of that long list. See all those diseases and illnesses that you've never heard of because they are so rare? Guess what - coronavirus is below even those.You would struggle to find an illness that has affected fewer people than coronavirus, but who needs common sense right? Sad for the Vietnamese people who will lose money over this. On the bright side I'm hoping it will mean fewer crowds for me and my family. So stay away people! :-)Edited: 4:57 pm, February 04, 2020 "
What a Jk_@$$ ;D
"We’re travelling this weekend for 3 weeks to Vietnam from north to south. Yes I do worry About Coronvirus but I’m young healthy and above all I think we just need to be meticulous about hand hygiene etc. Equipped with masks, surgical gloves, anti bacterial hand wipes hand gel etc so hoping all will be fine. All you can do is make a decision either way and then be comfortable with that cos otherwise you won’t enjoy your holiday as you should !"
"Love2travel, pls report back when you arrive at Hanoi and share your observations."
Certainly will do.
"I am in Hanoi right now. Even though there is not many infected, people are scared here. Some trips to Halong bay are being cancelled and some shows and tour and people is mostly wearing masks. Still most attractions are open, but that might change."
"ONE case in Vinh Phuc 80 km west of Hanoi, who went overseas to meet a Chinese and he was infected. She is treated in a Hanoi hospital, so, it is not one case in Hanoi, but zero !"
"Just as an update... We're in hanoi currently and all seems normal. I suggest wearing a mask around, not because of the virus but for the polluted air. Keep washing your hands and you should be fine! It's not crowded so even better to come now!"
"Thanks for the update , we’re arriving in 2 weeks . Nice to know how things are , enjoy your holiday"
"We have been in Vietnam for over a week travelling with Titan going north from Saigon and are now in hoi an it’s fine. People, tourists are not wearing masks, although we have them, so don’t loose your holiday, come awayPam"
