Have just read on a Lanza info site about a man who has been denounced and facing 600 euro fine for taking his chicken out for a walk on a lead !! Apparently happened in Yaiza . Can this be true ? Really ? Must be a joke in there somewhere just can’t think of one !
Did the chicken cross the road ?
I suspect fowl play
Someone egged him on.
"It was in Uga, and yes it is true about him walking his chicken and he could be facing a very hefty fine for failing to comply with the state of alert."
"Do you think he was taking the proverbial , or perhaps - how can i put this delicately - he’s not playing with a full deck . Hope the former otherwise a little harsh ?"
"I mean 600 is a lot considering the bird was only fined a “ poultry “ sum , just chicken feed compared to the fella !"
"Did he have to go up, in front of the beak."
He got away with it every other timeBut today he was just unclucky
Got bored of being cooped up.
"Extract from Politico .  ""people for walking a goat, a chicken and, er, a crab. Just to be clear, Catalan police have said the ban extends to canaries and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs."" https:/…"
Mr Sanders said he was just restocking.
Thanks for joining in the fun - some seriously bad jokes guys - including my own ! Just how many puns can you get from a chicken joke !!! Wonder if police confiscated the chicken and what the chief of police is having for his Sunday lunch tomorrow .........
