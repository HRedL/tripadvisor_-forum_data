"Hi all, We are going to Sharm end of June, staying in 3 Corners St George. Would you reccomend we all have injections? Also, what factor sun cream would you say we would need? Many thanks"
"You don't need any vaccinations. Other than bird flu, which didn't affect the human population yet, there are no currently active epidemics in Egypt. "
the vaccinations are reccommended though we didn't have them. you will need a high factor cream especially if you burn as it will be quite hot there. I use factor 30 anyway as i catch the sun quickly though i am mixed race!!!! I always have a tan!!!!!!!
"Hi thereIf vaccinations are recommended, which they are for Egypt, then they are recommended for a reason, you'd be silly not to have them, why take a chance, they're not bad.RegardsBarbara"
"Many thanks everyone, will have to get over my fear of needles then!! Cheers"
"Hi, injections are definately recommended but not essential, I work in travel and know a lot of people who travel to Sharm without any injections.I'm off to Luxor tomorrow and had Hep A, typhoid, yellow fever, polio, tetanus and diptheria...thats what the dr recommended got them all done in 2 jabs though and they didn't hurt.Check with your local GP the recepionists are usually happy to advise.
