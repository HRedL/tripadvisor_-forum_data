"Looks like my trip will be cancelled, due to arrive 29th August, however 2/3 uk based newspapers are reporting Croatia will be added to the “at risk” list this week. Really wish they would regionalise they way they do thi, as Cavtat/dubrovnik area hardly has any cases."
"Tell me about, we were booked to go to istria where there's hardly any but Easyjet have got twitchy and axed it's Croatia flights overnight by the looks of things, all the Southend flights gave gone including ours. Fed up of these overreactions."
"Very sorry to hear that Jools.I see that the number of new cases reported has reduced over the last two days. No idea whether that is indicating it has peaked or it is a statistical (weekend?) anomaly.https:/…Edited: 4:29 am, August 17, 2020 "
Hi RickBack to the drawing board for a new location as we can only assume all flights to Croatia have been pulled now by easyjet. No point trying to book flights there again. Thing is we were happy to self isolate on return if needed but didn't get the choice. Didn't get notified either so it's a good job I was checking my booking every day!
"Sad to hear that. Yeah, those exported cases are mainly related to ""party"" locations. Istria and Dubrovnik certainly aren't one of those..."
I have just checked our flight on Wed to Dubrovnik fro Manchester with Easyjet and it is still showing as on?
"Yes, Easyjet are still flying some routes and dates to Croatia."
"Hi Paul, if you go to try and book it on the easyjet sure it says there's no flights available on weds so be ware that yours are likely gone too. Easyjet are shafting us all."
"I would advise everybody with upcoming easyjet flights to Croatia to keep logging on a d checking and also checking the flight schedules - my flights were still in good working order last night, this morning all Pula flights pulled from Southend fur the foreseeable future. There's no reason to pull Pula and nowhere else because istria isn't where the outbreaks are. I think they are pulling the lot due to media speculation. It's frustrating and exhausting as this is the second time easyjet has pulled our flights!"
Really odd as just checked out jet2 flights for the return this Sunday and they are also shown as on
Jet2 might not be getting as twitchy as easyjet are over the press speculation. It's making me feel so angry because it's getting harder to get full refunds on separately booked accommodation when easyjet cancel without any formal restriction changes being made.
"I dont think the cancellations are to do with the cases rising as easyjet still flying daily to barcelona which has huge outbreak by comparisonthey did this long before - they are allowing flights to be booked and then cancelling those with low numbers - first they drop price, then they list as sold out and then they cancel. Mine was showing as sold out and not available and i only knew it was cancelled by checking manage my booking! No one ever emailed me at all!I only found out 4 days before travel too and mine was a package holiday, No flights with easyjet are safe as they are basing their schedule on those flights which are selling as they dont want to fly empty planesEdited: 7:27 am, August 17, 2020 "
"The thing is our flights were still for sale yesterday at around £250 for a return trip so not cheap - that's why I'm so baffled, the prices don't seem anything to go by - I think a big of the problem is the media speculation and the government refusing to regionalise restrictions is causing mass panic and masses of people suddenly panic and cancel their flights and the demand is instantly gone. Its so sad fur thr countries suffering the resulting affect. Trying our luck in a different country instead."
"They cant regionalise tho due to movement of locals within countries. Look at spain and the islands- the cases have risen massively all over now (due also to the spanish travelling for their own holidays) which shows it was the right decisionSadly nowhere is safe now from uncertainty- frustrating tho!Edited: 7:41 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Due to fly to dubrovnik on August 29 from Edinburgh. Need to pay rest of airbnb by Wednesday, I wish they would just let us now if we need to quarantine when home as I can't travel if only essential travel only as insurance won't cover us. Looks like we either pay the remaining balance with the possibility of losing money or sit tight and pray they don't take it off the air bridge. Decisions need to be made tomorrow morning at the latest"
"The breaking news is that easyjet are pulling outof their bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle so any flights from those airports to London anywhere look to be gone."
"I am flying Easyjet from Southend to Pula this Sunday, returning following Sunday and my flights haven't been cancelled"
They are pulling outof flying from Southend altogether so maybe you are falling lucky because your flights are this month rather than next month.
Yep it looks like it's the airports they pulling out of are the issue rather than it being Croatia - we may not have needed to go to a different destination after all but never mind we've changed it all now plus things still look a little ropey for Croatia.
"EasyJet still showing all fights to pula,dub,spilt from Bristol if that helps anyone"
"Yeah, I guess all this fuss is due to easyJet pulling out of Stansted, Southen, and Newcastle on September 1st.xxsmurphxx, looks like you're going to make your trip at the very last moment! Next Sunday is September 30th."
"Not entirely true, basso. EasyJet flights from Bristol to Croatia in October have cancellations."
Our easyjet flight from Bristol on Wednesday 02 September is still showing as scheduled
For the rest of you with flights to Croatia it'll be a case of watching and waiting in case of either cancellations due to lack of demand or Croatia suddenly being put on the quarantine list. We've swapped our cancelled flights for Sicily and just hope we don't get any further issues.Do keep checking your bookings thpigh regularly as communication from Easyjet is abysmal!
"You appear to be very negative and concerning other travellers regarding Croatia, if you have lost your holiday I am very sorry. But please do not put a negative stance for other i.e. stating that Croatia is on the quarantine list when it is not"
"That is not the way I see it. Jools has been severely inconvenienced and is trying to help others who may face the same situation.There are two partly connected factors here:1.The difficulty in gauging whether scheduled EasyJet flights will be cancelled at very short notice. There are several discussions about this. I managed to speak to them and, as a result of not trusting what I was told, have moved my flights earlier. My 6th October return flight was showing as Sold Out. Last week EasyJet said it was still scheduled and ""had not been cancelled yet"". It now looks like flights between Bristol and Pula are stopping at the end of September.2.Croatia is sadly getting close to the threshold for being put on the UK government quarantine list. There were articles on this in several national newspapers yesterday. Some othe countries have already taken this step. Although the new cases reported yesterday show a decrease, the Monday figures appear to always be lower and the next couple of days may show whether there is still an upward trend.Edited: 12:37 am, August 18, 2020 "
"We are currently in Cavtat, due to fly back lunchtime Saturday into Manchester with Jet2. Hoping quarantine doesn’t come in for us but also it will affect the Croatian people as they really need some tourism this year. As does everywhere I know. Fingers crossed for some subtlety with the rules to allow safe areas to be still open."
"Our flight from Pula to Luton was cancelled in September so I changed it to return from Zadar, I've changed all my plans and will travel along the coast now. If the flight is showing full it probably will be cancelled, Easyjet are consolidating all their flights so no planes fly empty. I hope I do get to go but this year is difficult with the current situtation. I would rather stay home than go abroad and catch Covid."
Useful informationhttps://www.koronavirus.hr/en
Croatia currently stands at 27.6/100 000 - it'd have to have 0 cases today to bring that down -unlikely- so its defo staying over 20 cases and as such quarantine is unavoidable going by the transport secretary quoted criteria. But also 11% of their testing is currently positive - ours is under 1% - suggesting their levels would be much higher if they tested more. Given other bordering countries have brought in restrictions it does seem almost a given
"Today 1,653 tests performed for coronavirus, 219 returned positive."
"Opening nightclubs and allowing weddings was definitely the silly move. In the end, opening clubs will come down as a decision that produced more harm than good for the tourist season. And weddings...that's not even worth mentioning."
