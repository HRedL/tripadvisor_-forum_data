"I've done quite a lot of travelling all over the world and I've never brought cash with me - not once. I always just withdraw local currency from ATMs. However, I see a lot of discussion on these boards about exchanging money in Buenos Aires. Is there something different about BA that I should know?I have no problem paying the ATM fees - I don't care. To me it's worth it not having to be concerned with carrying large amounts of cash.So, what problems might I encounter if I use my usual procedure of relying on ATM withdrawals and credit cards?Is there any reason why I should bring cash to Buenos Aires?"
"There was a large disparity bewteen the official rate of exchange between dollar and peso, and the unofficial (""blue"") rate.So, people used the illegal blue exchanges to get more for their dollars.No reason for you to follow suit. You can stick to your practice."
"The current official exchange rate in the ATM, bank, credit card is 8 pesos to the USA Dollar.The Blue Market unofficial rate is close to 12 pesos to the USA Dollar.Goods and Services within Argentina are based on the higher exchange rate.Dollars which you bring with you can be exchange at offices suggested by your concierge at your hotel or rental agency where you will receive the higher exchange rate.If it is not an issue to pay more for Goods and Services than you pay in Canada, then use ATM and credit card. If you want a discount, then bring Dollars and exchange at the Unofficial Blue Rate.People who are spending a lot of time in Argentina then find the Blue Rate advantageous.However, if you are visiting for only a short period of time then it doesn't have as much impact on your budget."
"The main problem is that you will not be able to withdraw US dollars from any ATM. Only pesos. You'll be able to use your ATM card (to withdraw pesos, of course) and credit cards."
"""If it is not an issue to pay more for Goods and Services than you pay in Canada, then use ATM and credit card. If you want a discount, then bring Dollars and exchange at the Unofficial Blue Rate.""I am guessing that goods and services will be cheaper in Argentina than Canada even with the official rate. Hotels I've looked at, for example, are about half what they are in Canada.""The main problem is that you will not be able to withdraw US dollars from any ATM. Only pesos."" - Right, but is there any reason I need US dollars in Argentina? (Other than to trade them on the black market).Thanks, folks! I think I'll just do what I usually do and it doesn't sound like I'll suffer much :)Edited: 6 years ago "
"US Dollars are not required in Argentina. As a backup currency in case an ATM machine is not working or a business doesn't accept credit cards, then Dollars will be accepted if you don't have pesos on you."
If you are ok with getting the official (manipulated rate) by all means use your credit card or ATM card. Many tourists do that. But then again many are bringing cash and getting a MUCH higher exchange rate.
"Changing money for the unofficial rate in Argentina is not difficult to do, and many times a hotel front desk can point you in the right direction (but not always). Plenty of people on this forum can help as well. Most hotels have in room safes where you can store your funds. I haven't heard of any traveller have an issue with money theft in BA in that type of circumstance outside of a hostel.Even for a trip of a couple weeks, the savings between the two rates can be enormous. It really adds up when you're eating out frequently, and especially when you pay your hotel bill in pesos (that's right).But it is your choice, there's no shortage of ATMs in the country."
Is counterfeit currency the epidemic I've been led to believe it is?
"There is some counterfeit currency, but it is not as widespread as it once was. This is probably due both to law enforcement efforts and the fact that inflation has made counterfeiting the largest denomination (100 pesos) much less profitable than it used to be.I've changed plenty of money in cuevas, businesses and on the street, and never received a bill that wasn't accepted. Of that, there might have only been 1-2 bills I wasn't sure of, but they spent fine - and Argentines will check. I'd say the likliehood of getting counterfeit bills from cuevas or a business (such as a jewellry store that will also exchange currency) is pretty low.Nonetheless, I find this is a helpful site to pass along:santelmoloft.com/2011/… At the end of the day, the chance of getting an occasional bad 100 peso note (about $8 Canadian but spends like almost $12 on the blue rate) is worth the substantial savings from all the perfectly fine bills you'll receive.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Everything I bought in BA in the way of goods from safety pins to very expensive leather bags and footwear were 1/6 of their retail prices in Canada. That was with getting my pesos only from atms there at the low official rate, not at the black market one. When I bought 2 bags or several pieces of jewelry at once, I just asked the best Argentine shops (not multinationals) if they could possibly give me a discount (of their choice) if I paid in peso cash. They always knocked at least 10% but more usually 14%, 16% or 20% off the total bill. I didn't shop at tourists' stores. If I didn't have sufficient pesos on me to pay a large bill or I wanted to go have lunch before going to the atm to get more before buying and carrying the things around with me, that was always graciously accommodated. They kept every deal made. Also, a Canadian saves an additional 18% (average rate of import duties on non-NAFTA-made consumer goods and another 13% tax (HST-) with his duty-free allowance. Because top-quality goods are so much cheaper at their regular price in BA than in the northern hemisphere, that allowance for returning travellers is enough to fill a huge suitcase with goods bought in BA although it would barely cover the price of a pair of designer shoes bought at Canadian prices or 2-3 pairs brought back from Europe. (Quality goods cost way more in Canada than in the US.) The black exchange rate isn't always as good as it first looks all factors plus how you feel about shopping for cash on the black market or not using a country's own currency are considered. And how long you''ll be there. As for meals out, there's no way I could afford to eat in Canada the quality meals I had in Argentina at every price level. Even with horrifying Argentine peso inflation, it's still cheaper and easier to eat well and healthily in beautiful surroundings with professional and thoughtful service in BA."
"if anyone needs peso i need euros as i am leaving argentina next week, please contact me,"
"March 2013 we got as high as 8/US$, while the official was just 5.our first 1K got us each 7,500 pesos, instead of less than 5,000 at the bank. that's an increase of 50% of purchasing power. we each took US$2,000 and were quite happy with that.we also use Credit cards with no FX fees, and ATM cards that have no ATM fees or are reimbursed.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT bring a POS debit card. Lost or stolen or even if someone just gets the number you can have your bank account wiped out so fast your head will spin.once back in the states you will be hard put to recover your money, and authorities there can do little to help you.we are going again March 2015 and will bring a lot of cash again, if the blue rate is still lucrative.does anyone know what it is.the official rate is now slightly over 8/US$Edited: 6 years ago "
"yes Argentina offers some great bargains, which is why we go there. Much cheaper than going to Florida even at the official rate.but with the 50% purchasing power increase we go in 2013 (see my other post).WOW."
"Nnevertheless, Northropfrye, if you are in Argentina for a relatively short visit, and the differential is not important to your budget, then yes, use the ATMs as you would in other countries ... And the banks, CCs etc. And enjoy your stay. You know yourself and what is important for you to have a safe and pleasurable vacation..."
"Under the current economic conditions, the official exchange rate is about 8.18 soles per USD. But with some domestic policies that don’t allow Argentinians to buy foreign currency (recently those restrictions have been loosened) there’s a black market (called blue, actually) listing the same transaction at 12.8 USD today. It’s somewhat illegal to exchange money outside of the official channels, but it’s so widespread, that the authorities look the other way. The main tourist areas (like Calle Florida) are full of people whispering “cambio, cambio” and they typically offer close to that 12.8 rate. The risk is that you may end up with fake bills, or the old swap, where you give them a $100 bill, they pretend you gave them a $10 or $20 and your exchange rate won’t be as advantageous after all ;-) I’ve seen that in Romania before, and most inexperienced tourists won’t know what hit them. The safer alternative is a service like Xoom where you can “send” money to yourself at any one of their locations, and pick it up at what today looks like 10.15 peso exchange rate. Safest, of course, would be straight out of an ATM, but you’ll get it at the official [lowest] rate plus you’ll pay whatever fees. So, under no circumstances use the ATM or credit card for purchases. If cash is king everywhere else, here it’s emperor! Just bring some cash to change locally, or send USD through the service i mentioned and pick up pesos in BA. Just make sure the Xoom location will be open ;-) For us, it happened to be Flag Day that Friday, so we had to cancel the transfer, since the service was closed! If interested, here's a bit more based on our recent trip: …blogspot.com/2014/08/three-days-in-buenos-a…"
"As of 5 minutes ago, the official rate was listed as $8.27 and the Xoom rate as $10.05. I've used Xoom twice in Uruguay and twice in Buenos Aires, and it's always been very safe and easy, so I'm using it again for my upcoming trip to Montevideo and Argentina. Have a great vacation, northrupfrye!"
"Just got back from Buenos Aires. Locals are pretty upset with the country's leadership and financial problems. Residents cannot buy USD. My husband and I had read about the situation before we left and, as a result, we brought with us WAY more cash (dollars) than we typically would on a trip. Before we left the States, we made a point of getting new bills, which isn't easy. We were very thankful to have dollars in cash during our stay. Restaurants would bring the bill in pesos and then we'd ask them what the check would be in dollars, and it was about 50% (as others have said, the difference between roughly 8:1 in banks and 11:1 or 12:1 on the ""blue"" market). Of course you will need some pesos as well, for taxis and other expenses. We trusted a local guide who introduced us to her friend who was a money ""dealer"" and he met us in the city's oldest cafe to buy our USD (11.5 pesos to the dollar that day). We avoided using credit cards due to the foreign transaction fees and also because using dollars in cash was so advantageous."
