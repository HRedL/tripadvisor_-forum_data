"I've had two separate flights to book today. Both times I've seen amazing deals on Skyscanner. Both of them were through Travelgenio on Skycanner. The first one was advertised on Skyscanner as being $260 US dollars. When I clicked through to buy it, the price on the website as listed in pounds, but ended up costing close to $400. Obviously I didn't book it, and when with another website whose price didn't almost double with taxes and fees.Then I went to book my second flight. Again, the cheaptest and best flight was listed for 780, and again, it was by Travelgenio. So I click through to book it, thinking maybe the other one was a fluke, but no. It ended up being $1,000 USD!! However, if I hadn't converted it from British pounds, the price would have looked normal and I would have booked it. I'm upset with Skyscanner for letting such a deceitful company advertise through their website. Please don't make the mistake!"
"The advice on here is to book tickets directly with the airline. As you found out, cheap fares on third party websites rarely end up being cheap at all!"
"That was another weird part. The flight was through Gulf Airlines, but then when I went directly to their website, they said they didn't have any flights for that day. The whole thing was weird. I ended up using Student Universe, and they give the price of the flight plus the extra fees up front, so you can compare it knowing the absolute final prices."
Why are you booking flights through 3rd party agents on Skyscanner ?Have you not seen any posts at all advising you not to do this ?Just bizarre what people will do for a CHEEP flight
I don't understand your currency point but most third parties - and I don't believe Student Universe is much different - don't advertise (key word which you got right) live prices. Skyscanner and other comparison sites are best used to get an idea of see who flies where before booking direct with the airline or at least using a reputable third party/agent.Edited: 4 years ago 
"Hi tsandweb, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"You can't blame Skyscanner if Travelgenio are advertising prices that turn out not to be available. That is down to Travelgenio, and they are far from being alone in this practice. You need to know how these things work, and be on your guard. Booking through the airlines is best."
"Sorry for duplicating my post here from another forum boards dedicated to Travelgenio, but I feel obliged to share it with the community. Yes, I can confirm that Travelgenio seems to be a scam. I have booked the tickets Davao - Hong-Kong via Manila through them. The flight was cancelled by Philippine Airlines (PAL) because of the typhoon in Manila. Nobody called me or sent a message. I have arrived to the airport where I had to take another flight around the typhoon with another airline company. I've called Travelgenio, and they told me that there is no problem in issuing the refund, and they will contact me in 2-3 days. Nobody contacted me again. In one week I've sent them email asking to contact the PAL for the full refund. They answered that they have already contacted the airlines and were waiting for their response. In a few days, I've sent them a new reminder and then contacted the airline directly. The PAL is a very friendly airline and their customer service is great. They showed a good will and tried to contact Travelgenio on their own to coordinate the refund with them, but to no avail. Then they asked me to send a message to Travelgenio or contact them directly and request that Travelgenio would coordinate the refund with them. Three weeks after cancellation of the flight have gone and Travelgenio is completely silent. I have sent them email again, but it seems there is no chance to get anything from them. So my very sincere advice - just stay away from Travelgenio, they really seem to be scammers."
"Hi Vladnet, airlines are the ones that cancell flights. We would like to check your case in detail. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will contact you to clarify what happened. Regards"

I am currently trying to reach a fluent or semi-fluent English speaking Customer Service person with Travelgenio. And I have been trying to do this for 3 DAYS! I need to change a booking and to flights upcoming this WEEK in 2 days and still can not get through to someone who understands enough English to make the changes. It is incredulous to me that they can't even transfer to me to a manager to help. I will caution anyone reading this to NEVER use this 3rd party agency. And I am kicking myself for using them now!
"Hi Felicia, of course we can help you with your booking schedule changes.

"Booked my ticket today and my flight is in 4 days time. Even with extra card charges the price and flight choice better than other sites but... my surname was altered during the booking process. I have a double barrel surname in my passport and use only the second half with my bank. So the system used the billing surname for the passenger's details field! Tried to call the customer service so many times but after 5-6 min waiting time, all calls were just cut off. Sent email and now waiting for a reply. Really hope the company will rectify this error because this trip is a family matter of urgency."
"Hi VAE13, of course we can help you with your booking data. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and the full passenger names and we will check with the airline if it is necessary to make any change. Regards"
"Sites like Skyscanner and even Google flights don't work in live space. Prices are always based on availability and those sites can't see what's actually available. They check once, maybe twice a day depending on their algorithms. Book through the airline directly or with a travel agent. Both work in live space."
"Skyscanner doesn't even pretend to be a booking site. It's a price comparison site, and the shonky booking sites that pay to advertise there are the oens that don't have live pricing."
Thats what they do all the time - they are not talking to you - they are trying to save their reputation.Scamcompagny!
"They are terrible, I recently booked a flight and chose an option ( flexible dates) where you are allowed to change the dates. It costs $50 extra. But once I wanted to change the date I was told that I had to pay over 300Euros on top of the $180 ticket just to change the date. Cheaper to buy another new plane ticket then to change the date on the existing one. Don't ever choose that option of paying $50 extra to have a flexible date ticket. It's only their way of getting money out of you. Be aware."

Our team will inform you about the possibilities of the changes you want to make and the conditions of the flex ticket for your petition. Regards
"They did inform me about a Jan 29 2018 available flight, I gave them a good ahead to change it to Jan 29, and they never did, nothing heard from no reply when emailed them for the second time and asked for flight information and a confirmation that it was changed."
"I'll buy directly from the airlines in the future, so much hassle to change the flight date, then I'm offered a more expensive flight with more stops when a less expensive one is available. A 5 minute change seems like rocket science to them, and it still wasn't changed."
Our team has informed you about the airline policy for the changes according to your ticket allowances. If you need further info please answer our mails. We will be pleased to inform you. Regards

All our customers can contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com as told before. We will be pleased to assist them with their bookings by mail or phone. Best regards
"If you ask people for their booking number, then you need to specifically tell them how to send it to you. Otherwise it look sas if you are saying to post it on the forum. Such action would be foolish, and not saying to send an email or a PM reflects badly on you and your company. You simply can't rely on your customers knowing not to display their info for the world to see."
"Very Bad ExperienceHad an extra A (one Letter) in Surname on my booking, and they refused to change saying Airlines does not allow change, contacted airlines they say up to 3 Letters change in name can be allowed but have to be requested by travel agent, but they refused to do so."
"The agent will have their own terms to the booking too as well as the airlines. As you've discovered the airline is more amenable to help you, so booking direct you wouldn't have had the issue in getting the name corrected."
"Hi Ripsy_12, of course we can help you with your name changes. Airlines have different policies for these changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking information and the changes you need to make and we will ask the air company if it is possible and if there is an extra fee. Regards"
So you won't be charging anything extra yourselves then?
"WARNING!!!!!!!!!! Travelgenio is the WORST possible agency. Lots o hidden charges. Misleading and deceptive information displayed as well. I booked a ""First Class"" ticket with this company which turned out to be ""Economy"" although the website and my confirmation states ""First Class"" (when the e-ticket is issued, it is Economy)."
Hi Carol. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Travelgenio seems to be systematic in advertising prices that they then charge a higher price for (maybe that's how they make their money) I just tried to book a flight with them through SkyScanner and realized when it was time to pay the actual price is close to $100 dollars (!!!) more... When I called to inquire, and asked why the disparity I was told that the price was no longer available by the airline (which is a lie because Tripsta actually sells the price they quote on Skyscanner) Then when I tried to inquire further my agent (Sergio Terrace) thought it would be a good idea to call me a liar.... when asked to speak to someone else - I was simply refused. It seems like Travelgenio is a scam, with bad customer service skills.... As consumers in the blind buying market that is the internet we should be vigilant to make sure these kind of companies don't exist."
"The very simple reason is that they and many others do not have live pricing. It’s also possibly deception.The airline always has the most up to date fares and seat availability, just another reason why I always use them"
"@78 -It certainly could be that the price changed during the initial Skyscanner search and the actual price quoted when Travelgenio did a real live price search. You may have also clicked on one of the (many) options for extra add-on services, like a service pack, like travel insurance or cancellation insurance. On top of that perhaps you selected a payment method which incurred a fee."
"Hi dColin, of course we can help you with your booking. We feel sorry if you had any incidence with one of our agents. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Thanks for you comment Travel_Undercover. You are right on your reasons. Through our searcher we make the live price search and show the results for available seats. REgards
"BAD BAD BAD Company!Travelgenio is a terrible agency!!NEVER book any flight or trip with them. My flight got canceled and I got offered a refund , It has been 2 months and I haven't got my refund.The costumer service either tries to get rid of me by referring me to the flight company, who refer back to Travelgenio again, or the costumer service of Travelgenio just hangs up on me when I call again.They are not a reliable agency, I had to WORST experience with them."

"Like Edreams, I think that Travelgenio's attempts at repairing their image by posting here actually have the opposite effect."
Well we booked tickets to go to Las Vegas in March only to get an email 24 hours later saying the flights you booked are not available we booked Premium Economy and they then said we have other flights for the same price but there only Economy so we said know and they cancelled out booking 2 weeks later we still have not had out refund of £1670 and I have had to book flights direct with BA. Travelgenio WHERE IS MY REFUND YOU ARE ROBBING ME OF MY MONEY NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!

"My wife purchased 2 return flights with SmartWings to Prague through Travelgenio back in April for a 23rd December trip for our honeymoon. On checking in online a couple of days before our wedding, she found to her horror that those flights had been cancelled. We were left with little choice but to buy 2 return tickets in the week before Christmas at by now, a substantially higher price than our original purchase. She tried contacting Travelgenio by phone and by email several times, but without success. They never returned her calls or emails. However, on posting about the problem on social media, they were very quick to respond to ask what the problem was. They then claimed they'd emailed back in May to inform us the flights had been cancelled. We received no such email. My wife asked them to re-send it, but they said they couldn't as they'd deleted it (even before the dates of the flights). Funnily enough, we'd received the emailed confirmation from them, but no cancellation notification. We asked for a refund, and they have, in accordance with their policy, refunded 85% of the total, but we are considerably out of pocket owing to the lateness of booking the replacement flights. If we'd turned up at the airport on the day to check in, which is perfectly reasonable, we would have been spending our honeymoon at Gatwick Airport.Draw your own conclusions, but I would say, yes, they appear to be a legitimate company, but their customer service falls well short of normal expectations, and you appear not to be ATOL or ABTA protected.We won't be going near them again any time soon."
"Hi David, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
David hasn't got a booking. That's the point. He was never informed that his flights had been cancelled and he doesn't want anything to do with you ever agin. Rightly so in my view.
"I am about to add to the hundreds/thousands of negative reviews regarding major problems when dealing with Travelgenio. I Have been speaking to their representative in Madrid from Sydney Australia for more than 1 hour, resulting in absolutely no resolution of my problem,  Last October we booked 2 seats to travel in April from Sydney to LA return, which included an additional fee to secure that our seat allocation was for 2 seats together.......this was offered to us on their site and they confirmed our seating request by return email at the time...... ""seating allocation request successful"" were the exact terms used by them.Three months later they now inform us that we no longer have requested seating and have placed us separately in different parts of the plane. We even suggested changing our flight and/or day of departure to secure our requested seats but they said if we upgrade (and pay substantially more for the privilege) they may be able to fix the problem. What a joke!  They have now told us to deal with the airline at the check-in counter on the day of departure. Good luck with requesting seats when ready to board the plane.We paid additional money for Travelgenio to organize our requested seating and now they have the nerve to us deal with it ourselves. What a scam! surprised they're are allowed to operate.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hi Ginmum80, please send us all the booking details and the extra services you contracted to customer.service@travelgenio.com. An agent will check all the information and contact you asap to give you an update regarding all your petitions. Regards"
"Even when people do make heir own seating requests, sometimes htings change and ht epassneger has to contact the airline again to put things right. A common reason for this is an equipment change, when the airline has toi realloct everyone and it's done automatically by a computer program.While it's rare for me to speak in favour of Travelgenion, I can see why it would be better all round for you to sort things out with the airline yourselves. In fairness, I can also why you might expect them to do it for you, but to be honest, I wouldn't trust them to do it properly anyway."
"<<I wouldn't trust them to do it properly anyway.>>Fully agree. Be happy if you get the flights you have paid for.Speak to the airline and have a look what they can do.Also, check that you have a valid ticket and check in case flight time is changing."
"I booked a ticket through Travelgenio (via Momondo) , I got to know on email that the booking was cancelled, and then they sendt me another offer same route and times (domestic Kenya) but double price, I didn't answer.I come home , now like 10 days gone, checked my account, coincidentally I see the initial booking , the cancelled one, was deducted!I called them, waiting a decade to get through, this lady says she will pay it back in 48 hours. That was like yesterday so let's see.I asked her also how they can deduct without issuing ticket and if I didn't call, if I ever would get my money back. She hang up!"

Salma A. We are having similar problems. See my forum question of a few days ago - 'Delay in Travelgenio confirming flight tickets'. Best of luck.
"I am actually having this same issue!I paid extra for window or aisle seat for my flight japan - sfo and they are telling me none of the seats I requested are available.I am a solo traveler, I bought my tickets in December for a March flight. There is no way the flight has only middle seats from China to sfo.It’s a total scam! I also spoke to customer service and they told me to try my chances at the counter! I have flown on many different flights and different companies and this is the first time I have been met with such terrible service, especially when I paid extra to be able to choose my seat and meal as it was indicated in their site!This is false advertising and for a flight as long as Japan to San Fran middle seat as a solo traveler is unacceptable, when you pay extra for it.I asked for an upgrade option and they quoted me 3000 USD more (2 times the price of my original ticket).This company is by far the worst I have dealt with and will never choose it again."

"This is a shout out and an example to companies that do not remedy their poor customer service...I WAS going to purchase a ticket through Travelgenio, and when I read all these awful reports, I decided to go with someone else, if a company is not interested in preventing these situations or remedying them, why do i want to add my name to the list of customers not happy, I will look for another company to do business with. And for Travelgenio, I don't mind negative reports, i just want to see what you have done to repair or remedy the situation, since you haven't, why would i want to do business with a company with unsatisfied customers? Thank you to everyone who posts reviews."
"shazy...all they seem to do is post automated responses on here always starting with the trite comment......""of course we can help""."
"Travelgenio, I'm not asking for a refund!!I'm asking for my son's flight tickets to be confirmed for his holiday next month!!"
"Julie, you have my sympathies.I’m not sure why Ttavelgenio bother to come on here with their copy and paste replies. To me, Julie explained very clearly what the problem was -delays in the revised flights being confirmed. Travelgenio on the other hand are talking about refunds.So many complaints though, so easy to muddle up who is complaining about what!."
"Thank you, AmoMondo, for your support."
"I am very disappointed with Travelgenio services. I booked a flight with them for the first time and was overcharged as well they couldn’t confirm the flight. And wanted to give me another even more expensive then the first. Their customer service reps that I talked to both were very rude and nonchalant. I couldn’t believe it I canceled everything and was told my money would be in my account in 52h and then 72h, they said all of it but I thrill doubt it. But then again I’m like if the flight was never booked. They should give me back everything. Now is a waiting game and seeing from other people reviews I see it will be a nightmare."
"Update ,the automated message they put, is a total sham. Still ended up hearing the same sh**, cant cancel and get a refund (even though my extra payment enables this) and cant change seat, try when you get to the counter. >.< Never again will I use this company. Worst service I have ever encountered. at this point, all I want is a refund and cancel my flight."
"Hi Tiana, please send us all the details from the flights and booking to customer.service@travelgenio.com.

Goodness - avoid this company unless you are absolutely 100% sure of your flights.My younger brother just booked with these guys yesterday and realised that the flights didn't actually work for him after booking. The flights are with Norwegian and their cancellation policy is 24 hours if flying to the US with a full refund. This bunch of fools however have said that because he didn't contact them until the next day to change (within the 24 hours) there was nothing they could do and he couldn't get a refund. I would encourage everyone to book direct with an airline in future - silly crappy companies like this are not worth giving your money to.
An update - we've spoken to Norwegian who've said that Travelgenio should cancel the reservation in line with Norwegians policy - but Travelgenio have said no this is not what they do.Gvien all of the comments here and elsewhere - I wonder how these sorts of companies can stay afloat.
"Hi Chris, of course we can help you with the booking cancellation. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and telling us if you want to cancel all the booking or just a part and we will inform you about the rate conditions for your request. Take into account that cancellations depend on the airline and ticket rules, the one accepted during the booking process. Regards"
"Beware pf travelgenio on booking.com. The prices are false. Once you proceed with the reservation, the prices dont match with the prices advertised. T"
"HI Emma, prices are directly connected with the airline fares in live time. Depending on the selection, dates, schedules, services, they can be updated. If you need any support, please contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
yes is true
"What these companies do not realize is that right or wrong, if they do not make the customer happy, then with a bad review, I myself look at the situation and think that why would I want to do business with any company that isn't going to help out the customer...so to all of you who have the courage and took time out to review these situations, it works, I did NOT BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIO...so your review did impact their ability to get a new client, I took MY business elsewhere!!!!!!"
Excellent! Someone who researches before buying. Good decision Shazy.
I’m having a terrible time with this company too! I booked my flights 5 months in advance to go to a friend’s wedding. Since then they’ve changed my flights several times so I had a massive stop over and then my return flight and connecting flight leave at the same time so I obviously can’t make it. They initially said they couldn’t help and I’d have to cancel. Then some helpful people from customer service contacted me with a revised schedule so I accepted that. Now they’ve confirmed the original schedule TWICE and I can’t get onto anyone. I know I should have researched but I’ve not had a bad experience like this before so I guess it’s a learning curve! This is a hugely stressful situation and I highly recommend you avoid this company
"Sarah. Don't worry. Someone from Travelgenio will no doubt be along soon with their stock answer to all posts..""...Of course we can help you with your booking...."". Good luck!"
"Hi Sarah, changes are operated unilaterally by airlines and, as a third party, we inform you and provide the alternatives offer by them. If you need any support or assistance with the latest itinerary, do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will check the possibilities accepted by the air company for your case.

"Travelgenio! you folks sucks. I tried to book a ticket through Skyscanner and found the cheapest deal from Travelgenio which was SGD760. I was happy and spent time to enter all the required details and landed to the payment page. Thankfully I noticed the price was shown as SGD830 in the confirmation page. I pissed off with this cheating agents. Note that I didn't do any add-on which they shown on their sites. I wonder how the price went so high where i selected the S$760 deal and the prices were shown only in SGD, Pure cheating.I'm not happy with Skyscanner for letting such a deceitful agents to advertise through their website."
"Hi Rajeevan, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
">>>I'm not happy with Skyscanner for letting such a deceitful agents to advertise through their website.<<<If Skyscanner became choosy about which companies to deal with, they would not have a business at all. Please remember that thy have no control over the operations of anyone who appears in the search results.

"almost every single supplier or website on skyscanner is having upsetting posts on TA air travel forum i don't know how skyscanner is letting all these low service third class websites to become part of it's big travel network, people go for these website by assuming that skyscanner will must recommend to a good website but heard many horror stories about almost every single website provided on skyscanner, i would just say for those who still use them ""Greed is always curse"".."
"THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE… THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! To anyone who wants to book through this agency, don't. This is why:1. It took me three calls to talk to someone, it didn't get anyone on the phone the two first times. It just hangs up..2. Call center people are rude. They hang up on you when they don't want to speak to you anymore!3. They offer ""Personalized Services"" when you buy a ticket. Don't take them! It's a scam. Loss of money, you pay for zero service. They say they select seats for you, but they don't. The way they describe the srvice makes you think you wil have to pay later on. You can do it your self on the airline website at zero cost.Will never use this service ever. They are thieves."

I have emailed at customer.service@travelgenio.com too. Waiting for the reply.Please any do not use travelgenio at any cost...they are just rip off..."
"Have never booked with them, always book directly with airlines, but from this thread I can safely say they don't have the worst customer service, others can be far worse."
"Hi Dhaval, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. If you have a mail to our customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit, we will check immediately all the details and contact you asap. Regards"
Yes....here it is again....the automated message!
"But in fairness, at least their Rep comes to the boards and offers assistance.Posters rarely, if ever return to say what the outcome is. If they still had an issue and it was not the customers fault (which we see quite a few of) then I would imagine that posters would return to continue their story. I suspect that the Rep’s interaction is helping some."
I'm sorry but it's incomprehensible to me how their customers have to resort to TA to (hopefully) get anything done.
"Maybe we'll never know whether the reps are helping or not, or to what extent if they are. I still think that their auto response is doing them more harm than good, regardless of whether they are helping people or not in reality."
I would have thought that the rep would encourage those who have been helped to post on this forum and say so. Obviously this is not happening. Is it because the rep is missing a trick or there aren't any successful resolutions?I suggest the latter.scoodly
"So do I. But at the same time, I'd expect that people would return to complain if nothing ever happened, so it's impossible to do more than guess.All I know for certain is that the responses here would put me off using them if I'd ever been tempted."
"Yes, fair point about people not returning to complain.scoodly"
"1> Customer compliant portal. Not available 2> Customer support specific mail ID not info@.... Not avialble 3> No mention about the cancellation policy4> Carrier permit the cancellation but your office cancel and take the money without refunding to the customer.While i started to book it showed me 172 Euro and when I booked it finally it charged me 203 Euro. The amount is changing after purchase button hence the compliant. Ii feel cheated when I see a different amount of debit in my account.Secondly it is not showing the cancellation / rescheduling policy. If a ticket is not refundable it should be specifically mentioned while booking. Upon contacting your office for cancelling this booking i was told that it is non refundable booking. BUt this was not the condition while booking. Jet airways tickets are refundable as per the carriers policy they do not have non refundable tickets. But your office says that it is not refundable, This will mean that u office will cancel the tickets and swindle the money.I am viewing all these anomalies very seriously, and preparing a suitable letter for stopping the business with your company for all the carriers."
"Hi umaswams, during the booking process all the info regarding the tickets is shown. If you need any further information, please contact us in our customer service mail (customer.service@travelgenio.com) with all the info and we will inform you about the rate and conditions for the tickets you purchased according to the airline rules for us.

"As an experienced traveler, I can say I've never experienced customer service quite as horrible as Travelgenio's. After booking our reservation, I was a bit concerned about our connection time since the airport's website recommended 90min for our particular terminal switch and our reservation only allotted 70min. I sent several messages to customer service but received absolutely no response. After 1.5 weeks of silence, I called to see what our options were, fully willing and expecting to incur some type of fee. From the very beginning the representative could not have been ruder. He assured me our connection time was valid and cut me off when I tried to explain the details from the airport website about our particular terminal connection AND passport control since I'm not an EU citizen. He then acted extremely bothered when I asked him if he could check on the earlier flight to make our connection easier (even explaining I was fine with some sort of fee) and continued to put me on hold several times to deal with other calls. After holding, he informed me the charge for changing would be 150euros (AirFrance's change fee) + 30Euros (Travelgenio's change fee) + 1350Euros (the difference in the ticket price)!!!! I asked him why they were charging since an insane amount when the difference in ticket price on AirFrance's website was a whole 36Euros. He rudely responded this is the only other flight available (completely ignoring my question about the price difference) and I'm not sure why you need to change when I already told you your connection is valid.I commonly book using third party sites and typically have no issues with customer service but Travelgenio is in a league of their own!! I can definitely say I will never be using them again and highly recommend no one else does as well!!Edited: 2 years ago "
I'm not sure why an experienced traveller would use a third party site for flight tickets?
It's always the 'experienced' travellers who make these egregious mistakes for some reason.Ah well.
"Hi Courtney, of course we can help you with your booking schedule changes if wished. Regarding the connection times, our site offers the connecting times airlines project for them, it is not our decision or selection, is the official connecting time offered by them. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and the changes you want to make and we will inform you about the changes possibilities of your ticket rate and, if they are allowed, the conditions for the changes. Regards"
Never mind because of course Travelgenio will be able to help them!!
">>>I commonly book using third party sites and typically have no issues with customer service<<<Wow. You must be a very lucky person! But this time, it looks as if your luck ran out."
"The wife booked flights to Cyprus with Travelgenio, we had an email ticket come through and I double checked with the airline, Blue Air, that it was OK and it came back all good. We did not try to change flights or baggage etc so no experience of any issues with them however they are Spanish based so phone calls are directed to Spain but they speak good English.No issues but next time we will book direct with the airline."
Thanks for your comments russ999rocket. It is important for us that our customers enjoy the best experience with our services. Regards
"Substitute the word ""important"" in the second sentence with ""rare""."
Excellent Frommy. I was just trying to compose a reply myself when you posted!!
I also booked a flight on travelgenio bit i dont have ticket till now i am very worried. Did anyone travel with them
"Hi Faizan, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
Also the airlines rescheduled the flight & said they have made the refund. But then your colleague said they have not!! How can we end this tragedy of mine? It's been over 15 months now.
"15 months is a very long time to wait for a refund. Even Edreams is quicker than that!My guess, Noh1a, is that you won't get a refund at all, as whatever amount the airline has given to Travelgenio has been eaten up with the latter's admin charges."
"I have had just very bad experiences with Travelgenio. When companies change flights, which of course is not travelgenio's fault, you email travelgenio to know what are your options and they don't even reply to you. I have sent two emails and today I had to call (I am in Brazil and travelgenio is in Spain, so imagine) and my first call went through a very rude lady who even hung up on me. Trust me, do not buy a ticket with travelgenio. You might think you are saving but in fact you are not. I have emailed travelgenio with a complaint with the details of the agent who hung up on me, let's see how they respond (if ever they do)!!!!!"
Hi Claudia of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards
This is not what I complained about . I complained about the rudeness of your agent and te fact that you don’t reply to emails
"Claudia. Travelgenio always reply with their cut and pasted answer, no matter what the problem. They don't read the posts!Good luck with getting anywhere!Edited: 2 years ago "
Hi Claudia. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Did you get a response Claudia, and if so, was anything resolved for you?"
I did... a very useless reply that they have implemented training so that it doesn’t happen again and that I only have two choices: accept or get a full refund (I have already cancelled a first flight so not sure what I will do). Will never buy with travelgenio again
"Dear Claudia, if you need any further information regarding your case, do not hesitate in replying our team's chain. REgards"
"Thanks for the update, Claudia, it's always good to know what actually happens after the reps have posted. A useless reply, or none at all, is pretty much what I expected!"
"I tried to book a ticket through Skyscanner platform, The search returns me a list of booking site where the Travelgenio was the cheapest one with price SGD841, When I click on book link I was routed to Travelgenio site where the same ticket was SGD880, Isn't it cheating?. why you have profit by cheating people.? Travelgenio shame on you. get out of the world."
"Hi Rajeevan, of course we can help you with the payment and prices doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Hi Travelgenio team,Thanks for getting back to me, I wonder why can't you explain/reveal the price discrepancies in this public forum? What is the reason the price had increased when I was rerouted to your site from search platform? This is not first time whenever i tried 100% of the time this is what happening. Hope this is simple question and you are in comfortable to explain the reason/trap behind this.PS: I opted NOT to book the ticket with your system due the above reason, thus I do not have any booking details.Thanks."
Rajeevan. Maybe stay away from even trying to book through Travelgenio again?
"Rajeevan, have you not realised that they do not have live pricing showing up in search engines?"
"Our searcher gives the rates available in for the journeys selected in live time. If you need any information, do not hesitate in writting us to our mail. Regards"
Are you trying to claim that your advertised prices are live with that post?
"Beware of Travelgenio on SkyscannerI booked a flight Berlin-Tunis on Travelgenio as it offered the competitive price of Euro 318 on Alitalia. However when I had completed the booking with my credit card, the price jumped to Euro 380 !!! Furious, I called Travelgenio only to be directed to their call center in Uruguay where I was told that because I used my credit card, I could not qualify for a some unbeknownst discount (I was NOT even aware about this!) and therefore I was arbitrarily billed an extra Euro 30 !! When I enquired if I could pay using another mean so that I do not get penalized, the agent offered only to cancel the whole trip while Travelgenio would still keep the extra Euro 30 billed arbitrarily. I'm extremely upset that Skyscanner would tolerate such deceitful practices from such companies to advertise through their website. Ironically, the same travel leg was offered by the same airline, Alitalia, for much less !! Please don't make the same mistake, check first directly with the airlines!"
"Skyscanner exists because on line booking agencies such as Travelgenio pay them to appear in the search results. No payments, no Skyscanner. It isn't paid for any other way, so they aren't going to investigate deceitful practices in case they end up with no income at all. Just book with the airline."
"Hi Fawzi, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
Skyscanner aren't going to be concerned about what other companies do. Why should thye be? They are not responsible for any deceitful behaviour. Just like Google isn't responsible either.
Can we just send it to you here? My incidece is 15 months ago. And you made advices like this twice but my refund is still undone yet.
Assistance is provided through our official customer service channels: our mail customer.service@travelgenio.com or the call center numbers available in our site. Our agents will be more than please to check your case and inform you about it. Regards
"Noh1a, it would not be wise to post any personal information on a global, public forum like this one."
"I booked through this company who also goes the name TRAVEL2BE. They swiftly sent through a couple of documents with a booking reference and so on. After a couple of months, i thought it odd how i'd still not heard from the airline to confirm anything, as i had through previous bookings with other agents.I had to call the airline as their web page did not recognise my booking reference, as i needed to add. The operator on the end of the phone then told me that the booking reference i had been given is not on their system at all and that they do not have any record of me or my family flying on our dates. We had also purchased the service pack to reserve our seats, baggage and meals with TRAVELGENIO / TRAVEL2BE. The airline told me that the seats are included, along with the baggage and they do not do meals. I had to argue my case with the airline that i had purchased 4 seats, as they would not help until i sent them all the documents TRAVELGENIO sent me. Then i had to do all the booking myself.After doing all the above i proceeded to contact TRAVELGENIO about their lack of involvement in putting through my booking and told them i want my money back for the service pack of which i had purchased for a service that is free.I am still in dispute with these people today as i write this, as i still not have not had an answer as to why i have had to reserve my own flights, reserve our seats and so on. They are in full denial that they have done anything wrong.. If i could post all the ridiculous emails from them i would but it is to long winded and you would laugh in shock at how thick and stupid these people really are at dealing with any complaint, as they are in full denial about everything and make out that the booking i had to do that they actually did themselves. I have asked for my money back in every email and asked the same things time and again, with no mention of any wrong doing, any apology or any mention of my refund, for something they openly said in one of the emails that the seat reservations are free along with luggage and the airline do not do meals. So again i have asked so why did you sell me the service pack for something that is free or not included. And ???? Nothing at all on the matter from them. All i get is the same thing over and over again. Your flight is booked BLAH BLAH BLAH withe the same details i obtained from the airline myself.Please avoid these people at all costs as you end up doing their job for them. Paying for things that you should not have to. And chasing them around as they must all of come out of some asylum. You get no definitive answers from any of them. When making a complaint you may as well be pissing in the wind"

"Totally Rubbish Customer care and Hidden Change. So many hidden charge, high credit card fees, rubbish Cancellation protection that only valid for 24 hours.i paid 165 dollar for only 24-hour protection.they even didn't say that it's for 24 hours only. Also, there was o way to avoid that Protection. What is the world they are still doing business? Very Misleading price shows on Skyscanner and when I click it goes up to so many extra charges. Also when i call the Customer care, spoke to two different person, they gave me misleading information . Literally you will be robbed if you book through them. Please Be aware and don't book through them."

"The best advice I can give you is never buy anything through travelgenio. I bought I flight from Madrid to Larnaca for this Tuesday and when I got to the airport they told my booking wasn't valid, I didn't exist. So I had to buy another ticket at the airport, paying 234 € (plus 160€ I paid to travelgenio). I had the worst time ever. Of course, I contact them and they don't want to reimburse me my money. They are scammers."

"I used TravelGenio for the first time the other day. And found much the same, that the price quoted on skyscanner was not the price when i went through to booking. I also was disappointed to find that after choosing the 'service pack' for an extra $30 per person for seat selection and special meals, that this does not include seat selection at all. All travelGenio do are the middle man between you and the airline (i am unable to log into the airline's site and chose my own seat or meal) and they sent me another bill for seat selection. VERY DECEPTIVE"

"Prue,If you had taken the time to conduct a 5 second google search - BEFORE wasting your times and $ with this company you would have been forewarned that they are a dodgy outfit - book directly with the airline in future - skyscanner is merely a search function to determine who fly's where"
Travel genio: terrible!!!They didnt notify our flight was cancelled and they basically told us to go fnck ourself the day we would fly. Go to the airport and figure it out and hung up

It seems you're a little too late to try and help now.
"I regret not reading your post before:( Today I made a flight reservation that website, TravelgenioI checked prices from skyscanner and it was giving the best price possible in my local currency- 8.600 TL and the price in my local flight company website was 9200.I filled in my info and card details up to that point there was a total amount 8600 TL written at the bottom. When it started to process payment, I saw on the screen a price of 9200 TL something.I immediately went backwards to see what is actually happening and got and email saying the payment was already done. I called your customer services immediately and they told me there was a discount for only a special type of credit card but there was no info or warning about this and the total amount was still 8600 at the bottom right before I pressed enter for the payment. I wanted to cancel it of course because the price they withdrew for this flight was already even a little higher than my local flight company.And the response I got from customer services was they would cut 60 euros off the total amount if I cancelled it.I ended up paying even a little more than the price on the flight companys website. This is obviously fraud and deceiving people. This is a fiasco I will write about on my blog and tripadvisor account and talk about wherever possible. travelgenıo puts customers in difficult situation and their solution is to make it worse seemingly. I DONT KNOW WHY YOU HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICES AT ALL UNLESS YOU ARE GONNA HELP PEOPLE WİTH THEIR PROBLEMS THAN MAKE THINGS WORSE. YOU MIGHT AND MUST HAVE CERTAIN PROCEDURES FOR CANCELLATIONS OR CHANGING DATES AND OTHER STUFF AND SHOULD APPLY THESE IF CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY DISRUPT THINGS ON PURPOSE. SO STAY AWAY FROM Travelgenio"
Totally Aggree!

They did apply their policies and procedures in accordance with the terms and conditions you read and accepted. What? Didn't read them?
"Travelgenio, they blocked me because I was trying to write a reply to my email in facebook.It's a great special service."
"Hi DongHo, could you tell us your booking code to track your mails and understand why you are not receiving reply?"
"Well, I wrote an email to both travelgenio and skyscanner about the issue. I ve explained the situation and attached screenshots of the final payment page which clearly showed my case was true and I felt terrible about it.both sides responded to me positively especilally skyscanner. skyscanner contacted travelgenio. Travelgenio sent an email saying they will compensate for some of the reduction they were expected to make. And THEY REFUNDED ME IN A FEW DAYS. THEY REFUNDED 70% OF THE DISCOUNT SEEN ON THE SCREEN.WELL, still I feel quite insecure with the website. They really need to warn people with any extra charges, special promotions, deals and so on and clearly let people see this on the screen of payment in details. Skyscanner sent me detailed email about the situation and general feedback about travelgenio and other agencies and they have followed my case closely.Thank you very much."
Thanks for your comments. We try hard to offer the best solutions when incidences occur. Best regards
"Travelgenio are theif Refund,Cancel type of transitions are not done in their system. I had sent more than 14 emails to 'urgent@travelgenio.com' but seems they reply with out reading email ....#TravelgenioIsTheif"

"We booked and agreed on 23Apr18 to Travelgenio's quote of SGD 686.09 (as printed on receipt) for a return flight between Brisbane and Port Moreby, with receipt showing SGD 686.09. At the end of the month, our credit card bill shows that they have instead charged us EUR 423.89, so is reflected as SGD 710.49 – an extra amount of SGD 24.40 (i.e. SGD 710.49 - SGD 686.09). On 13Jun18, when contacted, a Frederico from Travelgenio said that it is their policy to, after 3 failed attempts to charge SGD 686.09 to our credit card, they would ""automatically"" charge the equivalent amount in EUR (because it is a Spanish company), without informing the purchasers. (First time we are hearing that a merchant couldn't charge us in currency SGD but could in currency EUR!) When he claimed that this is written in their terms and conditions, and promised to guide and show us, the line went dead, and we were unable to contact Travelgenio for the next half hour when tried again - no one picked up even after holding on for a while. Furthermore, we read nothing in their terms and conditions as this Frederico had claimed. What they did is illegal and they should be made answerable for their illegal business dealings. We've requested for a copy of the transaction invoice. Let's see what their invoice would say."

Kim please don't post the same thing in multiple threads. Thanks.
Travelgenio is the worst company ever... they have still not reimbursed me for my flight 70 days later... they keep saying it is the airline that is not issuing the refund but I know it’s not true... moreover they are no longer replying to my emails! Do not buy from travelgenio or travel2be they are the same! Horrible ! I will have to sue them to get my 100 euros back! Thieves
"Confront them with the fact that the airline has told that they have issued the refund, and the date on which they did so. If that doesn't make things happen, contact your card provider. The more evidence you have that Travelgenion are deliberately holding on to your money, the better.However, make absolutely sure that you are entitled to a refund first. Double check that Travelgenio aren't going to eat it all up with their admin charges. Good luck."
"Hi Claudia S, of course we can help you with your booking rembursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times.

Claudia has said that the airline has issued the refund.
I cannot believe I didn’t read this first. I booked from sky scanner and the price quoted was 160.. then when I went thru the processing it became 206. So I logged out and re entered and it went back to 160 so I booked with no probs BUT BEWARE. I read everything during the process but when my ticket came thru you get NO BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE. So I ended up paying another 60 more at the BA site to get my 15 kg bag done.This is PURE SCAMMING when the site is the cheapest BUT NOWHERE and I mean NOWHERE does it say u have NO BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE until u have ALREADY PAID...
"Hi JusticeforallForster, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"justice, you followed a link from Skyscanner which is merely a price comparison site. You cannot book anything with of from them.You can't trust the prices you see on Skyscanner. They are either not going to be available, or they are deliberately misleading by quoting amounts that are exclusive of things like luggage.This is because the companies that pay to be featured on such sites as Skyscanner are unreliable and cannot be trusted either.Edited: 2 years ago "
I am going to formally involve Skyscanner If they don’t reimburse me my money
Could you tell us your booking code to check the current refund status?
5L9GSS I have sent you 3 emails with no response... I need my money back
">>>I am going to formally involve Skyscanner If they don’t reimburse me my money<<<I'm sorry, but I don't think that will achieve much at all. You'd be better off involving your card provider, if you haven't already done so."
Skyscanner you are lying . You just sent me an email that is GOL that is not giving Mg money back I just called GOL and spoke to them and they told me you have not even processed my reimbursement . You are LIARS and THIEVEs and I am both going to speak to my card provider and to Skyscanner! LIARS
"I have contacted both Skycanner and my cc provider. Skyscanner has gotten back to me after one hr, saying they have formally engaged Travelgenio, my cc provider has not replied yet. Please DO NOT buy from this horrible company ever, I have had customer service agents hanging up on me, so rude, so horrible, plus now they are stealing my money. I would have been better off buying tickets with the airline directly. Do not buy from them EVER! Skycanner: as soon as I go back to EUrope I will engage the Onbusdman to sue your açççç off, you thieves, don't you think this is over like this! Hopefully SKYCANNER will kick you out.GUYS, let's send this horrible travel agency out of business"
"Claudia,It would help to start with if you blamed the correct entity as Skyscannoer DO NOT SELL TICKETS. They are purely a convenient search site. And who or what is GOL?"
"Not blaming skyscanner, but they can't endorse a travelagency once they know they are tricksters and withhlodling money illegaly. They have a responsibility, and withholding money illegaly is a crime, they can't endorse a crime. GOL is the airline here in Brazil I was flying with, they have confirmed no reimbursment request has been put forward by Travelgenio and they cannot do anything, they have no business in it"
"You still have not advised who it was you actually booked through as it could not have been Skyscanner. Many third party ticket floggers pay Skyscanner to allow them to appear in the search results, and Skyscanner DOES NOT endorse them, the same as the New York Times does not endorse their advertisers.So, who did you actually pay?"
"Dear Claudia, our team is currently in touch with providing the info regarding your refund. Please follow our mail chain if you need any further details. Our agents will be please to give you all the update we already have and all the steps we are following as a third party. Regards"
"TRAVELGENIO IS A SHAM COMPANY. It does not even deserve 1 star. It should get negative stars. Seeing other people's post about travelgenio just confirms I am not alone in this sham business. I searched my flight on skyscanner and they led me to book on travelgenio for the flight timings I wanted. When I went to the webpage, there was NO information on luggage weight, seat selection etc. On top of that, I was charged a higher price from what was supposed to be the ""final price"" and only realised it when the bill came. Such FRAUDS and it is really audacious. Trying to call their call center, my line was persistently cut off and I had to call multiple times to reach the operator. After reaching the person, I was told they had NO POWER to assist such services and was asked to email instead. Why have a hotline when it is useless? Was also informed I had to pay for their service if they assisted me? WHY? When the fault is with how travelgenio operates and scams people their money. The price listed on the website I was suppose to pay is different from what was charged to my card! I was charged a much higher price!!In addition, after emailing travelgenio to ask about so many inquiries about the flight, they only replied ONE question and said ""the discount is based on what card you use to pay"". Firstly, I don't even know about the ""discount"". Secondly, I don't even know what card I am suppose to pay for the ""discount"". Thirdly, the ""discounted"" price is what was advertised on skyscanner website and the ""final"" price I was supposed to pay on travelgenio website. They conveniently ignored the other questions posed eg, baggage weight etc. Travelgenio has very bad service and replies and they pretend to ""solve"" problems when reviews are brought to forums when they cannot be bothered to solve it in private email. It seems like many buyers are frustrated with their services. This company should be blacklisted and reported to the authorities. BEWARE AND STAY AWAY FROM TRAVELGENIO."
And which authorities in what country would that be?

"Jonathan. I think you are 100% correct about Travelgenio coming on here with their ""Of course we can help you..."" standard useless reply and seeming to want to help people. As you say, if they had any intention of doing so, people would not have to post on here as a last resort because they have got nowhere emailing/phoning them.By the way, they don't read any of the posts as you can see from their cut and pasted responses.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Oh dear, Jonathan. You weren't led anywhere by Skyscanner. They simply displayed some results, and you chose to go to one of those results of your own free will. I realise you didn't look into the company at all, but wasn't the lack of information on the site you went to a bit of a warning sign for you?My usual advice when anyone has bene overcharged is to contact their card provider and report it. However, in this case I would urge you to double check that you were actually overcharged first. I would not be at all surprise dif Travelgenio listed the charges on their website somewhere, maybe in the T&C's, and you did not notice them. If I'm right, your card company will not be able to help you.For the future, please bear in mind that there are a lot of very poor booking site sout there, and they are all trying to grab your money. One of the ways they do this is by posting attractive, but usually unachievable, fares on websites like Skyscanner and Tripadvisor.Trust no one, and always do your own research into whether a company can be considered reliable before proceeding any further.You and Traveller are perfectly correct, by the way. Travelgenio's responses here are pitiful, and they appear not to help anyone at all despite their pretence to the contrary."
"Beware of Travelgenio on SkyscannerSUCH A SCAM ive made the order after i paid for the tickets there was a pop windows said the prices was change from 210EURO to 225 EURO so i need to confirm it, what should i do after i spent my time on the order the original price was 193 EURO but they took another 17EURO for my card ( its a lot).i wish they can only charge what they publish any way i will never order with them"
"Hi Avi, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Travelgenio sent me a reply after I had contacted Gol airlines and Skyscanner. Skyscanner had taken the issue very seriously and asked Travelgenio to contact me immediately. They sent me a request refund with a IATA number but no date. I just called the airline GOL again and there is of course no record of that request in the system. Moreover my reservation was canceled on April 5 and money was sent back to TRavelgenio, GOL informed me. So travelgenio is stealing my money and producing fake records. I have informed Skyscanner again immediately and will now see how I can proceed against Travelgenio . This has caused me enourmous stress and money spent calling both Travelgenio office in Spain and GOL here in Brazil. It’s very sad to see that they are actually thieves and producing fake documents and I can only suggest to inform immediately Skyscanner so that they can kick them out (Travelgenio and travel2be are the same brand$m). As I could see, Skyscanner has taken my complaint really serious and they have asked me to follow up with any news. Please don’t be fools like me, don’t buy from Travelgenio & Travel2be they are thieves !!!"
"Dear Claudia, refunds take their time to be processed by airlines as we are informing you by mail. If you need any further assistance or info regarding your particular case, please reply the open mail chain you already have with our support agents. Regards"
"Travelgenio you are lying. As I said, GOL has confirmed they have sent the money back to you. The refund number you have provided does not exist GOL has said. You are lying. Once Latam airlines reimbursed me in 2 weeks! I will sue you and ask for damage.. and this post is for others to know what a scammer you are"
"Dear Claudia, our team will send you once more all the info regarding your refund. Best regards"
"I've had the same experience. Really annoyed as you have provided an appalling service to my vulnerable daughter. Has to go to hospital, tried to cancel/rearrange her flight but could not get anyone to speak English. She has lost 600 euro. Why accept bookings from English speaking countries when you don't have or don't provide English speaking agent to deal with a simple query and request. Just appalling."
"Hi Michael M, of course we can help you with the booking cancellation. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the medical information and certificates, with your booking reference and telling us if you want to cancel all the booking or just a part and we will inform you about the rate conditions for your request. Regards"
"Michael. Good luck with this!!!! ""Of course"" Travelgenio say they can help you but they have just cut and pasted their stock answer!"
"I doubt you will get much help at all, and I don't think there's much chance of a refund, either."
"Michael, if your daughter had to cancel/change her flight dates due to a trip to the hospital, then that is what travel insurance is for. Is your daughter covered by a travel insurance policy? If not, then these are the consequences for taking a risk while traveling without insurance. Were the tickets purchased non-refundable? If so, then why would you expect them to be canceled and/or changed without paying major penalty fees?"
"My tickets were mis-booked, it took 4 hours to reach customer service, I keep getting put on hold, then after 5 or 10 minutes the line cuts off and I need to start again. And again. And again. After 2 days I just asked for a refund, and they agreed and said I should have a confirmation email within 1 hour. That was 2 days ago, I have gotten thru 3 times, each time they promise a confirmation email, still nothing. As I write this I am on hold, I now been trying to call Customer Service for over 2 hours to again find out what is wrong. Worst. Travel. Site. Ever."
"BWK, as difficult as it may be to believe, there are sites that many of us would describe as even worse. Just take a look at Edreams or Kiwi.com, for instance."
"Hi BWK2011, of course we can help you with your booking rembursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your rembursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"BWK. Just to let you know that you have been given the cut and pasted stock reply everyone with a problem gets. Travelgenio will not even have read your post properly, if at all. Good luck!"
"Beware the Travelgenio on Skyscanner. I was rejected by the airline staff today at EVA airline at New Chitose Airport. The reason is when I booked my name is correct. When issuing the E-ticket to airline the surname and given name were wrong. When I tried to contact the Travelgenio ,Phone is rigging and nobody answer . End up I couldn't board the flight. I called the customer service for compensation. they say they can't do anything.  Next time booked directly to the airline. just because of saved by 20 bucks and select the bad customer service ticketing agent."
"Hi Burnett, names in tickets are the ones provided during the booking process as it is an authomatic process that is confirmed by travelers. We cannot change no name during the emission. If you need any information regarding this and the confirmation details you agreed, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will help you. Regards"
"What on earth does ""We cannot change no name during the emission"" mean?"
"I think it means that Travelgenio are denying that anything would have changed. I believe them for once, because I suspect that the process is automatic with no human involvement hat might cause a typo or some othe rmistake. However, as always, I could well be wrong.Nonetheless, I think Burnett is right to book direct in the future, and I'm not at all convinced that they even saved 20 bucks. It certainly looks as if, in the end, they los a lot more than that."
"I was also cheated by Travelgenio.They cheat their users during the payment process to receive extra money illegally and without the users' consent.As you mentioned, I saw their price on Skyscanner - it was the cheapest - 612 EUR for 2 round tickets to Vienna. Eventually they charged me for 700 EUR - extra 80 EUR just like that.When I wrote to their service customers, they wrote that the 612 EUR is a discount for special card holders. During the payment process the only price appeared was 612 EUR. when you click on ""charge"" they probably change the amount, without receiving your confirmation and consent in advance.I definitely do not recommend Travelgenio and I will never book via their site again.Beware."
"Hi Rotem B, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
NEVER BOOK A FLIGHT WITH TRAVELGENIO!!!! I had the worst experience ever with this company. I booked my flight and when I went to check in at the airport my boarding was denied because Travelgenio canceled my flight without noticing me about it. So I had to buy a new ticket at the airport which cost me a fortune. NEVER AGAIN WITH TRAVELGENIO!!!!!
Manuela.I'll help you with this by saying to read post number 263 as you will get one identical to it before too much longer from Travelgenio.
Hi Manuela Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards
Oh good grief! Not again. Please READ the posts before sending one of your replies!!!! They were NOT informed of any changes and it is too late now to offer alternatives.
"To be honest, there are also some pretty clueless people around, and with the thousands of warnings not to book with such 3rd party agents, they either completely ignored them all, or didn't even bother researching in the first place"
I can only confirm what is stated in the other reviews. The price mentioned is far from the actual price to pay. They add a bunch of extra and it is often cheaper to book directly with the airlines sites even if you lake 2 one-way reservation son 2 different airlines.They simply cheat with he customers.Edited: 2 years ago

"After 3 months and after I formally involved Skyscanner, Travelgenio reimbursed me. I lost 10 euros on exchange rate as the Brazilian currency has been going down tremendously. I provided written proof that the airline sent my money back to Travelgenio on April 5, so they withheld my money for over 2 months. I harshly complained to Skyscanner as well, as I believe they are covering for Travelgenio. They told me after my emails a formal complaint against Travelgenio has been logged by them. My best advice, besides not to buy with them any more, is to involve Skyscanner immediately. That is the only way to prevent these people doing the same to other people! Me, I will never buy from either Travelgenio or Skyscanner again!!!!!!"
"Thanks for your comment Claudia. Refunds depend on the airline times, so we feel glad that finally all finished. Regards"
NO!!!!!! READ THE POST!!!!Claudia has not said anything good at all about Travelgenio and has said she will never use you again.
"Travelgenio,When in a hole, stop digging!You really are making your company look worse than they actually are. Which I didn’t think was even possible."
"As I said, the airline sent my money back on April 5th, I have written proof. You chose to withhold my money without any reason for almost 3 months. So my comment is actually against you and I hope Skyscanner shuts you down, because you are a very bad travel company. I WILL NEVER AGAIB BUY WITH YOU OR SKYSCANNER!!!"
"Travelgenio contacted us on 06 July 2018 after some prompting and said they would refund us the excess that they charged us, BUT on the condition that we sign on their ""settlement agreement"", which bars us from ""[publishing, posting, or commenting] negative feedback on any social media resources""!This is unethical and should be illegal too! We are talking about our money of SGD 24.40 which they took from us without our agreement, as a consequence from their charging us in a different currency which we did not agree to! Therefore, it is their responsibility, and a responsible and ethical business practice, for them to give us back the amount they over-drawn from our credit card (refer to our post no. 213 above, dated 13 Jun 2018, 08:31). However, instead of doing the right thing and make right the wrong they have committed by returning us the money of exactly SGD 24.40 that they wrongfully took from us, they want to continue to add burden on us by making us first agree to unnaturally and to consciously stop spreading the truth about them (so that they can have the opportunity to penalise us later if/when we forget ourselves and shared the truth about them later?)!This is ridiculous, illegal and wrong! Travelgenio have no right to put a condition to the return of the amount that is rightfully ours!Return us what is rightfully ours! PERIOD!"
"Hi there ! If you bought the ticket through Skyscanner I do suggest to let skyscanner know of both issues. They said they already formally logged a complaint against Travelgenio for my issue, so that might add yours too and eventually understand the real nature of Travelgenio!"
"Dear jhlchang, could you please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the booking details or tell us your booking code? Regards"
"Dear Travelgenio / Travel2be (including Ana and Adrián from Travelgenio / Travel2be),As replied to you (at urgent@travelgenio.com and atencionalcliente@travelgenio.com) in response to your e-mail yesterday where you ask us again to sign the ""settlement agreement"", and since our feedback on you at TripAdvisor [see 1) no. 213 (13Jun18, 3:31PM), and no. 279 (16Jul18, 7:15PM)]: -The SGD 24.40 is rightfully ours. Your organisation is currently wrongfully withholding our money from us and, by telling us that if we want our money back we have to do as you say, which is to sign the ""settlement agreement"", you are putting an unnecessary contract to burden us further! We are not signing it! Just give us back our money!This is not a settlement! This is called ""returning the money that you wrongfully charged and charged without permission, to the rightful owner""!"
"@Claudia S (at no. 280)Good idea, Claudia! Will go to the source where we booked our air travel from!Thank you!"
Hi jhlchang. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"I send request on travelgenio webpage last week but get no reply, I post my request at here and send mail to travelgenio now, hope I can get response soon."
Could you tell us your booking code to follow your case?
I did not book through travelgenio but got notified via their site that my booking had changed. Now that is really fishy business and when I tried to get refunds was blocked by the airline and the original booking agent from doing so! Incredible that this sort of fraudulent operating procedures are allowed by multiple governments.
What fraud? Selling you non-refundable tickets as explained to you in the T&C's.
"Hi Tony, Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Who did you book through, Tony? My guess is that it would have been a sister company of Travelgenio."
My guess is that he thought Skyscanner was the booking site.
That's very possible as well!
"Travelgenio, I reply the mail from your urgent people yesterday but no response until now."
Check my email tooo
TG I didn't find them on Skyscanner so I'm safe. Sweet.
"I checked my email, but nothing. Sorry mate, I don't know your email. Good luck."
"Hi shih-hsian c, you will receive a reply to your mail asap. Regards"
"Hi Horii G, could you please tell us your booking code to track your mail and check why you have not received yet reply?"
"Hi wanderer05, if you need our support please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
Wanderer. You are not safe believe me! Just because you didn't go through Skyscanner doesnt mean a thing.Edited: 2 years ago 
Indeed. Travelgenio are an unfunyy joke no matter how you got to them.
"After this message till now, I still not get any response#297 of 305 ·Hi shih-hsian c, you will receive a reply to your mail asap. Regards"
"Same for me it looks like TravelGenii is a big F scam, i booked a flight for 630$ but on the email they sent me they said it really cost 678 nearly 50$ they charged me without notice. Their customer service is never available. Never gonna book from them again ! Don’t get SCAMMED"
Good luck with that - I'm having the same problem. I just need to organize a credit due to a relationship break up but can't seem to get anywhere with them.
"Why is it that when a person calls your customer service line, it disconnects all the time? I'm calling with a genuine query, and no one seems to be able to help. I've also emailed the above email address and would like a reply."
"""Good luck with that - I'm having the same problem. I just need to organize a credit due to a relationship break up but can't seem to get anywhere with them.""Before you spend hours more trying to contact Travelgenio, have you checked to see whether the tickets you have bought permit any kind of credit or refund? You most likely chose Travelgenio because they appeared to offer the cheapest price (certainly could't have chosen them because of their glowing reviews on Trip Advisor). The way they offer cheap prices is to sell the most restrictive tickets the airlines offer, often non-refundable, non-changeable, and to add conditions of their own so even if the airline is willing to refund you, most or all the refund or credit is swallowed up in Travelgenio's administration fees. This is how they make their money - not off commission from the airlines - this no longer exists."
"Don't ever use Travelgenio. It's a scam. First I purchased some tickets through Skyscanner. The tickets were $1200, when I got the comfirmation email I had been charged $1350. Then I wanted to change my travel dates, I rang once and was told that they could not change the first leg of my journey because there was no seats left. I decided to try a week later, after a hour and a half of auto answered and being disconected I got through, the customer services person told me to change the dates it woud cost $2800. I hung up after being told that was all he could do. I checked Skyscanner again and Travelgenio had flights for $2200. What are these scammers trying to pull.You know where Travelgenio can stick there flights. Very disappointed and will never use them again or recommend them. Stay away you have been warned."
"Hi amtdumitro, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"If you bought your ticket through Skyscanner the best advice is to email them and let them know. They said to me they had logged a complaint agisng travelgenio for my issue, so hopefully the more people formally complain, the quicker we can get this outlaw out of business."
To late Travelgenio I booked tickets through another company. I had all ready emailed you and never got a reply. I rang you twice you lied the first time then tried to rip me off the second time. the only way to make this right is to refund my money or credit. We know this will never happen so the ball is in you caught. Do the right thing or I will spread the word.Thanks for complicating my holiday plans. And making it a stressful experience. Good on you Travelgenio thanks for everything.
"I think the word has already been spread but unfortunately, it didn't help you!Did you notice that the Travelgenio rep who posts on here has over 2,000 posts and most of them say exactly the same as the reply you had! Good luck!Edited: 2 years ago "
"'If you bought your ticket through Skyscanner the best advice is to email them and let them know. They said to me they had logged a complaint agisng travelgenio for my issue, so hopefully the more people formally complain, the quicker we can get this outlaw out of business.'What response or result are you expecting from Skyscanner? If you receive anything more than a cut and paste reply I'd be surprised, and as long as Travelgenio pay Skyscanner they will be linked at that website as Skyscanner are out to make a profit (as are Travelgenio).'so hopefully the more people formally complain, the quicker we can get this outlaw out of business.' It's a nice thought, but complaints will do nothing. The easiest way to put a dent in this website's continued existence is (wait for it) to stop using it. That's the tricky bit, as consumers continue to rush to these less than desirable websites and throw money at them, convinced they are going to get a bargain. Five minutes' due diligence will indicate a different outcome, and the clever consumer would then go directly to the service provider to book."
"Your reply is useless and rude... skyscanner wrote to them for 2Months pressuring them to contact me and they were worried about an image damage... so say whatever you want, I advise everyone who want to get any reimbursement to engage Skyscanner as I did. I got reimbursed in the end"
"'skyscanner wrote to them for 2 Months pressuring them to contact me and they were worried about an image damage' If by this you mean that Skyscanner are/were concerned about damage to their image, then I rather doubt it.Skyscanner is owned by Ctrip who have a substantial stake in selling travel. If users are displeased with Skyscanner and/or companies linked through the website then there will be more to take their place no matter the state of their operations.If the airline had refunded Travelgenio then those funds should indeed have been returned to you, but pressure by Skyscanner wasn't likely to be significant in that outcome."
"As I said, your reply is just useless and I am wondering if you have not been engaged by Travelgenio to post this, given the uselessness of your replies that help really no one, I am starting to think so... useless person by all means"
"Hi, just fyi, these are what we call in the States, 'Bucket shops"" they are 3rd party companies who false advertise too good to be true deals to entice you to buy the cheap ticket. But what you dont read, as most dont, is in their fine print--once you pay, they do a bait and switch and can change your dates/airlines and tix price at any time. Also, as you said, if you look up the exact same flight on the Airline's website, some of those flights advertised, dont even exist! Always book your ticket directly with the Airline website!! These are scam artists..and just google Travelgenio reviews..and you will fall off your chair--complete SCAMMERS..avoid like the plague!!! Happy Travels, Soleil from LOS ANGELES and PS: there are so many of these companies..they advertise hidden, in regular CheapAir.com or Expedia.com etc...so just go directly to the airline, book your ticket and you will be guarranteed a good ticket. :D"
"Claudia,Just because a poster isn't telling you what you wish to hear, does not make their reply ""useless"" or ""rude"".For the record, Traveller Plus does not work for Travelgenio."
'I am wondering if you have not been engaged by Travelgenio to post this' Wonder no more. Kennydon is correct in that I have nothing to do with Travelgenio or Skyscanner.Being pragmatic about what companies claim in their advertisements (hint - talk is cheap) and knowing how to avoid losing time and money is something one learns. I've made enough mistakes to have a good idea when someone is promising much more than they'll deliver and do what's needed to avoid repeating the errors of the past.
"LOL @ Claudia S in reply #316.<< I am wondering if you have not been engaged by Travelgenio to post this>>If all the people who recognise these 3rd party flight sellers (Travelgenio, eDreams, KIWI, Budgetair, Cheapoair et al) for what they are and say so on this board actually worked for them, we'd ALL be millionaires."
"TP is corerct, Claudia. You might not agree but that doesn't mean that they are worng, and it certainly doesn't mean that their advice is rude or useless.It's far better to protect yourself and your money by researching companies and steering well clear of rubbish ones like Travelgenio than to rely on other sites like Skyscanner to do it for you."
"Claudia you are very rude. Of course TP doesn't work for Travelgenio and her replies are anything but useless.Travelgenio have a rep who posts on here to try and ""help"" people. Have you looked at some of their posts? There is no need to take our your frustration on other posts because you made a mistake and gave your money to such a dreadful company."
Apparently I got a problem with those crooks too! Two days ago withdrew money for FlyDubai Delhi-DBX-Moskow for 15.08.2018. but no any confirms at all! Their p/number in Madrid also doesn't answer and website exclude possibility of on-line communication & climes.Why Skyscanner allow to provide such unrespectable service?! A lot of customers climes over there!
Travelgenio pays Skyscanner to be able to advertise their shonky prices there.
Hi Paul S of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code or the mail used in the booking process and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards
">>>Why Skyscanner allow to provide such unrespectable service?! A lot of customers climes over there!<<<Skyscanner aren't a consumer protection agency. Why should they care too much about how Travelgenio operate? Like Google, they produce a list of results and that's it."
"I am totally unhappy, upset and disappointed with Travelgenio. This is the first and the last time I am booking from them. Situation - I booked a flight with them about a week ago before travel date for my business associate, on the day of travel while checking in at airport , airport counter staff couldn't find the booking and told us the booking is not found and is being cancelled. Payment has been charged to credit card a week ago after successful booking, I called the 24hr customer service hotline and was connected to someone from Europe I think, the line was laggy where I had to speak and wait 5 seconds before the other end could understand, to make matters worse she don't seem to understand my message and situation. I raised my voice because I was real mad , the embarrassment caused and the blunder cost us this business meeting. We have no choice but to book another flight on the spot. After returning , I wrote to Travelgenio for refund and compensation. Till this date no refund was received and when I followed up with an email, I got a reply saying I requested my refund to be cancelled and that they will process shortly. I don't understand how bad they can get, even at refund stage I get silly response like this Totally unacceptable and will tell everyone I know to avoid them at all cost !"
Contact your credit card provider and ask them to dispute the charge if you paid for tickets which didn't materialise.
"Yes I did, it will take 3-6 months as the card provider needs to carry out investigations and all that jazz"
Hi Eric T. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your rembursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards
"Travelgenio is the worst travel agent in the world. Avoid them at all costs. If you book earlier, they will cancel your flight to sell it for a higher price just days before your departure. This is what they did to me ?"
"Handy, how come you didn’t read this thread before you booked. Joining TA to post after the even is pointless, research before parting with your money.It’s the airline that cancels flights not and online ticket reseller. It’s likely they never booked and paid for your flight and they blame the airline. You only have yourself to blame for booking with these shonky resellers."
Handy. It doesn't seem credible to me that you booked with Travelgenio then managed to find this forum on Trip Advisor today to moan about it.
"Hi Handy, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap regarding the booking cancellation and the reasons for it. We should see if there was a payment problem, a non airline ticket confirmation or even some involuntary changes. Regards"
They are the worst! I warn everyone to stay far far far away from these crooks. As I’m writing this I’m currently on hold waiting for one of them to pick up my call after they had intentionally dropped it the first time. I wanted my booking to be changed and they told me to hold; after several minutes they dropped my line. They are nothing but thieves and crooks. Stay faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar away !
"So they are “thieves and crooks” because you are having difficulties contacting them to change your flight? Possibly understaffed or poor after sales telephone service, but I don’t see why they are thieves and crooks.Do you purchase a ticket that permits changes?Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hi Mohammed J, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
The biggest problem is that there is no contact number or e-mail to reach Travelgenio when you have a problemI know because I tried and their e-mail or cancel sites do not work.
"Jerry. You can stop worrying. Travelgenio will be along shortly with their cut and pasted response, offering help.Good luck. You're going to need it as they don't bother to read the posts!"
"Whether you'll actually get any assistance after they've posted a message like the one in 337 is, of course, debatable. Whatever your problem is may never get resolved, I'm sorry to say."
"Hi Jerry, We received your mail. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration."
"I agree with every single word you have said ,these guys are really a clown"
"Hi Ozgur, if you need us to check anything regarding a Booking with us, please write to customer.service@travelgenio.com. regards"
"I sure wish I had never went thru Travelgenio. I have been trying to get my money back for 3 people's flight to kona from honolulu because at the time the person we had rented a condo from for Sept said she wasn't renting to us because the Vog was to bad . They have refused over And over it is 315.00 dollars each way so about 700.00 . Now that the hurricane came thru they still refused , they won't give me a credit or anything . NOTHING AT ALL THEY AND THE HAWAIIAN AIRLINES RIPPED ME OFF."
BEWARE OF TRAVELGENIO THAT'S THE TRUTH. They ripped me off. I had 2 sets of flights for 3 people 1 set to kona from honolulu and the other set thru Hawaiian airlines from honolulu to kona. Both ripped me off. They have refused to refund due to so much vog that the condo owner refunded our money because she didn't want to rent to us. They refused to give a credit also. Both places have gave me the run around several times. So then came the hurricane and they still refused to credit for future flights . I am going to sue them in small claims.
Travelgenio just lies and steals from people their hard earned money. The money they took was from my daughter whom is a heart and kidney transplant recipient an she does not have money to give away to them or to Hawaiian airlines. They won't even give a credit and it was because of the volcano and then the hurricane. I will never ever buy thru them or Hawaiian airlines
How are Hawaiian Airlines responsible for this issue when you chose to appoint this mob as your agent to act on your behalf?
"Hi lifeat50_12, of course we can help you with the booking cancellation if your rate and airline allow it. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and we will inform you about the rate conditions for your request. Regards"
"I'm confused, sorry. What have Hawaiian Airlines done wrong? They can't refund you even if they want to, because their contract is with Kiwi. As is yours."
"'They have refused to refund due to so much vog [sic] that the condo owner refunded our money because she didn't want to rent to us.' If 'they' are Hawaiian Airlines, then if they were operating flights despite the fog it wouldn't have mattered what a rental property owner chose to do.'They refused to give a credit also.' Once again, if 'they' are Hawaiian Airlines then their fare rules regarding weather delays will be available at the website - did you read those fare rules? Sounds like you didn't, but you should have.'Both places have gave me the run around several times. So then came the hurricane and they still refused to credit for future flights.' Horrendous Travelgenio isn't well known for aftercare, but again the airline's fare rules are ahead of those of a third party ticket seller. However, since you asked this awful operation to act as your agent you will need to deal with them regarding rebooking. If you cancelled because of 'vog' then you're likely not going to receive much back from the nonrefundable tickets Travelgenio would have booked for you. 'I am going to sue them in small claims.' You won't get far, but general advice is only bet the amount of money you're willing to lose.lifeat50_12 has an interesting posting history. What happened to spending the month of September in California?"
"It’s difficult to follow exactly what happened as the tale (given three times) is slightly incoherent each time in its own special way, but if the issues stemmed from heavy fog and hurricanes, why not claim on your travel insurnace? Did they already deny the claim? Explain what happened when you pursued this avenue.Your daughter’s status as a transplant recipient is neither here nor there. The same rules need ot apply to each person, rich or poor. If a ticket was non-refundable (and were these tickets non-refundable as I assume they were?), then that means no refund."
"If the quality of the air is causing sickness to people there , then that's not what I paid for and they should refund. And my daughter's status I stated because she is the one that paid out of her 750 a month to live on that 715 dollars she tried her hardest to save up and the air quality changed since we booked the flight."
"""Vog is a form of air pollution that results when sulfur dioxide and other gases and particles emitted by an erupting volcano react with oxygen and moisture in the presence of sunlight. The word is a portmanteau of the words ""volcanic"", ""smog"", and ""fog"". The term is in common use in the Hawaiian islands""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Voglifeat50,Vog is a fact of life in areas of Hawaii, particularly the Big Island, and conditions vary constantly. Surely you and daughter should have been aware of that before booking. If a combination of conditions and health issues prevent travel, that is what travel insurance is for."
"lifeat50, you didn’t answer my question about the travel insurance. If the weather in Hawaii caused conditions that were too unsafe to fly, did you claim it on your travel insurance/your daughter’s travel insurance? What did they say about your claims? Was the ticket refundable or non-refundable?"
I have travel insurance and no one Wil cooperate with the other one on this deal.
Well according to the Hawaiian person that has lived there their whole life it is Vog. So that's what I will call it. Some people are so rude and just smart a but that's fine maybe they have money to burn she does not. And no it was not this bad in many many many years for your Information.
They will not answer me . They keep asking for more information on every thing. I have sent them this info more than once and then they want several days to go over then they ask again etc.
Yes I have asked and sent information to them more than once . Then they want 10 days or longer to go thru it again. Then it starts all over and they want morebinfo and more time .
No part of the tickets are just thru Hawaiian airlines o.k. then the other ones on return trip are thru travelgenio but still on Hawaiian airlines. Travelgenio saidbif Hawaiian airlines agreed they would refund other wise they could give us a credit for a future flight with them to be signed up for and then taken within a year . But the airline blames travelgenio . Travelgenio says it is up to airline understand ?? And then neither one will give us the credit. Also I did have Insurance on one set of tickets and they won't do nothing either. Everyone is shoving it off on the other one . And the Vog. Got so bad the person with condo would no longer rent due to it causing health conditions .
"Didn't say it was to unsafe to fly , but it was to unsafe for people to be there after it landed where we had a co do rented. And really do u think 715 dollar will break the airline ? Well they won't go broke keeping people's money."
"Were Hawaiian Airlines operating flights during your travel dates? Did they have any cancellations due to vog or other weather-related issues? If so were your flights cancelled - never to fly at all - or were they delayed to operate at a later time?HA have guidelines for changes in their schedule and their general Contract of Carriage: https:/…domestic-contract-of-carriage and their rules will override those of any booking site. Unfortunately you used a terrible third party booking site and have to deal with them, but any refund or credit will depend on whether you cancelled the trip or whether HA did not operate the flights (although they should have offered alternate flights, but they'd communicate that to Travelgenio who may or may not have passed on the information)."
Because we choose to go to California for 1 week instead and go to hawaii for 2 and spend time at home why does it matter what my plans and how long I stay in California? Is that a problem with u ? And According to travelgenio the airline does have the last say and told me if they agreed they would refund. I was told I could get a credit on a future flight but they haven't even done that. And my Insurance won't do anything but pass the buck also. My vacation where this airline was to take us was unfit to breath the air. Therefore unfit to fly us into the area and make us breath it.
Is cancelling for weather-related reasons an insured risk on your travel insurance? Did you have cancel for any reason insurance?Did you ask HA or Travelgenio to cancel the flights or rebook the flights at a later date?
"They won't get together on anything , they all want to say it is up to the other one . Even the insurance which I won't buy ever again Because they just keep giving me the run around. It is really unfair they take people's money everyday like this. But I can and will take it to small claims and I do have a small claims case and it will coat them more than the 715 ."
"Still no answers to the important questions.'But I can and will take it to small claims and I do have a small claims case and it will coat them more than the 715.' You may try this but you stand to lose more than $US715. Have you checked and double checked the terms of your insurance (which is often weighted in favour of the insurer, that's not uncommon) and the airline's fare rules? Do so before considering any claim, as if you choose to take action outside the contract you had agreed then your claim won't get far."
"@ifeat50_12I am trying to understand what has happened and what you do try to achieve.To my understanding you have rented an apartment, and the contract has been cancelled and the money of it refunded to you due to low / bad air quality.You expect now, that the money for the flight tickets also gets refunded to you.My advice:1.) If you can prove that the air was bad to the extend that a member of your party given health issue was not able to travel there, then you might have a chance to get some money back from your travel insurance. However, this will also depend if vog is something unusual or something you could have know.2.) As long as the airline is flying, I see no reason why they should refund the money to you beyond the ticket conditions. And from what you are writing the airline was flying. Please understand that the airline transports you from A to B. They do not care for what reason and what you expect to find in place B.3.) Having a third party between you and the airline makes things even more complicated and checking what an member of Travelgenio tells you, is difficult.4.) Be carefule in throwing good money after bad money. My expectations: Unless your travel insurance pays out, I give you very little chances of getting any money back.In this context, it does not matter what the turnover of the airline or travel agency is, what does matter is the contract you have entered with Travelgenio.Please also keep in mind that you have no direct contractual relation with the airline but only through Travelgenio."
It cost 80 dollars to file this claim and they won't show up for 715 so they will loose and would anyway
"They may not show up in court but are you sure the jurisdiction of this court covers Travelgenio? It’s one thing “winning” your case,it’s entirely different getting payment.It’s entirelyup to you, but if they defend in writing, you won’t win. It’s not about what you want or think is fair but the terms of the contracts you agreed to.You’re not permitted more than 1 account on here"
"Lisa H, are you and lifeat50_12 the same person? AmoMondo has made a very good point. THe case could be defended as I understand things, and even if you do win, it may be difficult to enforce the judgement. I believe Travelgenio is a Spanish company and may just ignore whatever the court decided."
You company is a scam. I wish I have done my research before booking the flight. On hold for the third hour now second day in a row. No one answer the call. Stay away from this people. Save yourself a headache.
"Lifeat50,Who did you purchase travel insurance through? Was the ticket non-refundable? If your vacation rental canceled due to the vog, but the airline still flew all of its flights, then I don’t think you have any case. Did the vog impede Hawaiian Airlines from flying their scheduled routes that day? Did you booked flight actually fly? If so, then I don’t think you have any case. You made your own judgement call that the air wasn’t clean enough to breathe, but if other people still flew and the airline didn’t deem it enough of a problem to cancel flights then you forfeited of your own volition IMO. It’s not like a volcano erupted and all flights for a week were canceled and now Travelgenio/HA won’t refund your tickets. You just chose to not fly even though the flights were running (if I’m understanding correctly). If the airline says it’s safe to fly, I can understand why your travel insurance would take their word over the word of your rental person who canceled. Who knows why she canceled- it could have been for a million reasons and she just blamed it on the vog. You’re really giving her a lot of credit and not questioning her word at all when she could have had her own ulterior motives."
"Oh... should I have to read this!!!Nobody use Travelgenio!!!You will spend money much than your flight ticket!If you want to cancel because of Travelgenio's fault, you should pay penalty about 200 euro!If you are rich or hope you waist your time or lose your ticket after booking choose this company!"
"Dear Seong, our team is currently in touch with you informing you about all your queries regarding the cancellated flight you asked us for and the conditions to cancell the other one although it is confirmed as told by mail. If you need any further details, you can reply our mails and our agents will be pleased to assist you. REgards"
"Was searching all day for flights on various websites. Travelgenio had the top hits for several websites. However, each time I tried to book the flights, the price would suddenly increase by £400+ each time (a message in small font appears saying that the airline has ""just"" increased its prices). This is only discovered once you have entered all of your passenger details, entered your card details and have just submitted payment. It is absolutely shocking and a complete waste of time. It is clearly a complete scam and relies on people agreeing to this massive increase in price, either by accidentally pressing the enter button or believing them that the airline has suddenly increased it's prices (untrue by the way, I checked). I have been checking my account to make sure that payment has not been taken and so far, no money has left my account..."

Nope. They never read any of the posts.
"I just wanted to say how glad I am that I googled reviews for Travelgenio and came across this thread. Looking for flights to Australia from London and Travelgenio's price (found via Jetcost website) was much cheaper than anything else. But after reading your comments on here, and also some of those posted on Trustpilot, I will be steering well clear from them. Thank you to you all."
Well done Nikki for looking.
"If the comments of fellow travellers weren't enough to put you off, Nikki, I'm sure that Travelgenio's posts did, lol!"
They cheated me also
"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction to one of staff in Travelgenio. Lucia, you are very rude. Me and my girlfriends supposed to buy two tickets from your company but because of your unprofessional, rudeness, impatience, unhelpful and hurrying to hang up customer services and making us so disappointed. At last, We decided to go with your suggestion to buy the tickets from others company instead of Travelgenio."

Travelgenio!!!! READ THE POSTS!!!!!Golden does NOT need your ridiculous cut and pasted response as they did NIOT buy tickets through you!
>>to buy the tickets from others company instead of Travelgenio.<<Please tell me by that you actually went directly to the airlines and not to another shonky third party...

Great advise. I became very suspicious of this travelgino when I noticed a significant difference in all their prices with that of the airlines (and very weird connections too). Avoid these scammers. It's not worth the trouble

">>Booked most of my flight through Skyscanner<<You can't book through Skyscanner, as it is only an advertising web site. Your problem is with whichever web site you got to when you clicked an advertising link on Skyscanner."
"Booked most of my flight through Skyscanner advertised website but never had this issue before. (edited to reflect the correct booking nature)It's the first time I see website requesting passenger to fill in Name and Surname of passenger, hence I fill in full name in the Name field and Surname in the Surname field for 2 bookings.When I received my travel itinerary, I was horrified to see the surname repeated twice in travel document. I called the airline and the airline said I have to change the name, so I contacted their call center to make the change for 2 bookings I have made, and they emailed me with only the 1st booking code.I provided them with all the travel documents required and ask them to charge accordingly to my card for both bookings. (I admit I should have clarify the details with them before booking hence I accepted the modification charge of 30Eur)But the dumb thing is they only made change to my 1st booking!Now they are requesting to cancel my 2nd booking and re-book the flight and charge me all those administrative fee for this and the new and more expensive ticket price!Now I'm wondering why should I be charge on 1) their misrepresentation on their website for the Name and Surname instead of First Name and Last Name?2) their miscommunication on the modification of name resulting in them missing out one of the booking modification requisition?And it appears their hotline center operating in India works round the clock but the person handling email (yes, the person making changes for you) operates only in the office hour!Due to the time zone differences and the person handling email only works 6 hours a day (the call center told me that), I have to wait for them to reply my email to get things done and this emailing, to and fro, is too inefficient!Oh, it reminds me that they either DO NOT REPLY your email on weekend or you need to CHASE them for reply!My request to modify name was made on last Thursday. I received reply on Friday, Monday and Tuesday. No reply from them at all over the weekend.Worse booking experience ever encountered.PS: Travelgenio, you don't have to reply me here with your generic answer here; expedite my email request will do. I have already emailed your customer service. Am waiting for them to reply me because the person in charge is not in office yet."
"Hi Zion029, of course we can help you with your name changes if your ticket rate allows changes. During the booking process there is an advise asking passengers to fill their names as shown in the documents they will need in order to avoid problems during the trip . Airlines have different policies for these changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking information and the changes you need to make and we will ask the air company if it is possible and if there is an extra fee. Regards"
"<<fill in Name and Surname of passenger>> <<I fill in full name in the Name field and Surname in the Surname field for 2 bookings>>Why on earth would you enter twice your family name to make a ticket reservation?Surname => family nameName => First name,"
"Why on earth would they not use First name instead of stating Name which is ambiguous in an international platform intended for international use? As what you have written, why didn't they write First Name and Family Name in their portal?Perhaps you have not filled in forms which requires you to fill in both your full name and surname."
Why on earth would you chose to book with a shonky third party booking site?Edited: 1 year ago 
"Have never encounter with any issues with Skyscanner advertised website before. This is the first. As the saying goes: once bitten, twice shy. Will check their reviews before placing any booking next time."
I booked a flight from Doha to Berlin via Travelgenio and had no issues whatsoever with the flights. As for the prices as long as they show the correct price before you click pay and that is what one pays I guess thats fine by me. It is a bit crazy though if you have been lured to the lower price and then find out that its a bit higher.In my case I couldn't really make out because of the different currencies involved.

They see what appears to be a cheap flight and go head without reading the T&Cs or doing any kind of researchWhy did you decide to use them without coming on here first and reading some of the thousands of warning posts?
"Hi Wanderlust, if you need us to check anything regarding a booking or the final amount shown during the process do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
OMG!!!!Has anyone at Travelgenio even LOOKED at any of Wanderlusts posts?He does not want your help. He wants action taken against you!!!
How to call travelgenio?
"Hi Apple you can find our call center numbers in the Customer Service / Contact section of our site www.travelgenio.com. If you need us to help you, you can also reach us through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
Where can I call regarding an issue on my booking?? Been trying every number and email on your sight and to no avail!
Pls pls help me regarding my issue with my booking
Hello Roam;Please tell us your booking number o contact us by email: customer.service@travelgenio.comBest regards.
Travelgenio.. If there are any real people out there and not just bots....this is for you.Please tell us what is the point of asking people to contact you by email and giving the email address if you still don't reply? There poor souls have been trying in vain to contact your dreadful company and post on here as a last resort....and still get no help. You need to think about what it would be like if members of your own families had fallen foul of a shonky company. I'm pretty sure you would not want them to go through what your customers go through!
"Poor Roam<<Been trying every number and email on your sight and to no avail!>> Answer from Travelgenio: << o contact us by email>>.This is getting slowly as good as this one: ""Hello, I wish to register a complaint"" => This parrot is dead!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218"
"Hi Roam, you can find our local call center numbers in our site www.travelgenio.com/pages/contact. Also, you can contact our agents through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
NO!!! Roam has tried contacting you via email and has had no response. Your posts on here with false offers of help are totally useless.
"Yes, totally useless and designed to convince the gullible that Travelgenio cares. The truth, though, is there for all to see. You are a totally useless company with boilerplate replies because you don't care at all."
Same sh!t happened to me today...Do not book with TRAVELEGNIO.....period
"Hi Kenhom, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"

"Hi Mabelina777, of course we can help you with your booking and airline confirmation and. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"Travelgenio.Your bot made a bit of an error hrere. It pushed the ""reply"" button at the same time on two different threads. This would be impossible to do if a human was typing your replies.This is just one more example of how very little Travelgenio values their customers. Disgraceful."
I bought a flight ticket from Turkey (Sab) to Copenhagen (cph)I paid the money. I got no ticket. I get some booking numbers etc. But no ticket. Then I went to Sabiha Gökçen Airport. The airport I was going to fly from. Once I speak with the Flight company (Turkish Airlines) that my ticket belongs to that I bought from Travelgenio... I was told that the flight is from another airport + that my name is not on the passenger list of that plane. I just drove 2 hours and payed fees to cross bridges. And I really have to be in Copenhagen the comming 4 days. Meaning i will likely pay 4x the ticket price.I will speak with Travelgenio.I don't understand how the plane is departing from another airport than the one I bought it from on the website.
"Hi Lex T, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
">> I don't understand how the plane is departing from another airport than the one I bought it from on the website.<<Turkish airlines do not operate from SAW to CPH (only IST) It sounds like there never was a ticket booked, has money been taken (and not returned) to your account?"
Very bad experience Travelgenio---Shouldn't trust itIt seems that it is not only me. The amount being billed was actually 30$ more than it was shown up from the screen just before the final payment! The service team insisted that the amount should be the higher amount. It is ok as it is only 30$ more but it is unpleasant experience and an integrity issue. The company didn't do proper things.
"""It seems that it is not only me.""I can guarantee you that the 454 posts before yours are not complimentary, nor post on several other threads about this ticket flogger. What a pity you did not look before giving them your money."
"Hi Scenic24009091176, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Well that's a good one...….""and we will check immediately"". The Travelgenio bot is having a bit of a joke today!"
"Uh oh, just booked... we will see if payment/refund comes through but now I've got that nasty, sinking feeling.Has anyone actually had a successful flight with these lot? They seem to have a functioning wikipedia page, most of their good reviews on other sites come from 1 poster accounts which is a bit concerning.Anyone please see the link below for the European Order for Payment, it allows citizens to sue people in other member states.https:/…Will update based on outcome, hopefully isn't one of those holidays where I'm fretting until I'm actually safely on the plane in the air."
"Hi Dreamer06077048431, if you need support for your booking, please send us all your doubts to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Our agents will assist you. Regards"
Dreamer. According to other posters on here who have had the stock reply for the Travelgenio bot offering help...they still got nowhere. Sorry.
"Well I actually did get the tickets and a check on the airline's website does indicate a corresponding purchase with the correct name/dates/times. I also don't appear to have been double charged, or had my details stolen and I was charged the price quoted so that's the first few hurdles cleared!The email address did also reply promptly which was nice.Now the real litmus test is the wait over the coming months (I fly end of July) to see if things get changed or cancelled, as I said would have been nice to not have to think about this but I guess it's too late now."
"You should try to search on more flight meta search to get best deal.I use Kiwi.com , Hopato.com and skyscanner as well."
Travelgenio to Kiwi? From the frying pan to the fire.scoodly
"I totally agree! I booked a flight earlier today, received an email saying the flight was confirmed. Received another email asking me to pay again and this time the rate increased quite a bit. Called customer service, they told me the airline din't confirm my flight and tht I nee to book a new flight. When I questioned them about it the woman hung up on me. Crap service, never again!"
"Hi FarAway06714388337, we will be more than pleased to answer all your doubts through customer.service@travelgenio.com. regards"
FarAway.Of course Travelgenio will NOT be pleased to answer all your doubts through customer services or they would already of done so and not hung up on you.There truly is no point whatsoever in having a bot post these inane replies on here!
"The bot replies here are hilarious. As long as you haven't been a customer of theirs, naturally!"
"Agreed Roj. Not at all funny if you are a customer as you think you will be getting help but as we know from people who have tried getting in touch this way, it is not the case at all."
"Travelgenio are big scammers in the world. I recently booked a flight spending huge amount of money. Travelgenio agents have forced me to cancel the flight some or the otherways. There are rowdies sitting in spain they are monsters to deal with. They dnt help to correct the bokking. Last minute i contacted the airline and got the correct bokking. But the travelgenio scammers tried to colapse the booking again and tried to cancell the booking. after the airline gave them the warning , they stopped. stay away for your safety. book directly with airline. shame on you travelgenio."
"It's a pity that you had to learn the lessons the hard way. Your conclusion is correct as far as I;m concerned. It's better to book through the airline. If you are tempted to deviate form this in the future, make sure you check out whoever you are thinking of using very thoroughly indeed.Traveller, it's not funny at all for the people who have used Travelgenio. They are a disgrace, and they don't even seem to care that they are making themselves look totally ridiculous with their posts here!"
"Roj. You are right....they simply don't care. They have a steady stream of clueless clients so have no need to offer any real customer service. If someone stops using them, someone else will soon be along to fill that gap. I honestly don't know why they bother to post on here at all."
I don't think it would make any difference at all if they didn't bother posting here. Apart from depriving me of a good laugh every so often.
"Hi Screen, we would like to know more about you are here relating. Please send us a mail to check your booking and case in detail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the info regarding your booking code and issue. Regards"
"One week has gone by, my flights are still there and my bank account hasn't been charged (although foreign exchange fees come in a few days after the original purchase so be wary of this), so satisfied with the whole process so far - albeit a bit shaken after those initial first few hours!Will continue to post periodic updates."
"Hi Dreamer, if you need us to check or update anything regarding your case, please contact us through the official customer service channels: mail or call center. Best regards"
"Cuidado al comprar un boleto aereo con Travelgenio on Skyscanner,no son responsables, realizan o hacen ventas de boletos sin tenerlos disponible,te dicen esta confirmado tu booking pero luego de 3 a 4 horas te dicen que esta cancelado el booking,Booking cancelled - 2XWP48, que forma de trabajar tan irresponsables,esto tiene un nombre:ESTAFAstay away from Travelgenio, they are not seem to be scammers.they are scammers"
"Jesús, you will receive a reply by mail during next few hours. Regards"
“they are scammers”—-Posting your booking reference on a public forum online for all to see certainly helps those who like to scam.
"Not that I need to, but I'll add to the complaint list. Three times now I've tried to book a flight, and the same thing happens: I get the price on Skyscanner, Skyscanner sends me to Travelgenio, who confirms the price is available. Halfway through filling in details, the price (without notice) goes up $50. By the time I get ready to hit ""Pay"", the price is up again. So I clear out the cookies, exit Firefox, shift to a different IP address, try the whole process again--with the same exact prices and results. I disagree with folks that say always book with the airline; I've had great success otherwise, but be careful. Travelgenio is one to take a pass on."
"Hi Freightdog99, if you need support or need our assistance in your booking do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"Freightdog99, Skyscanner does not send you to Travelgenio,it's yourself .You have to click on the link (which gives the name of the OTA) to complete any purchase, so in no sense does Skyscanner ""send"" you to any OTAEdited: 1 year ago "
"I had a different problem with travelgenio. I booked a flight with them but had to cancel.I accept the airfare is not refundable but the AIRPORT TAX IS REFUNDABLE. I tried to get my airport tax back from travelgenio. They said it was impossible. I tried to discuss it further but they hung up on me, this is after being put on hold for long periods and having painful conversations with someone for whom english was obviously a 2nd language. In the end they agreed I could get my airport tax refunded but would have to pay 30$ for the privilege of getting what I am owed."
"I had a different problem with travelgenio. I booked a flight with them but had to cancel. Thier ""customer service"" is shockingly bad. I accept the airfare is non refundable but AIRPORT TAX IS ALWAYS REFUNDABLE. After being put on hold for long periods and having a painful conversation with someone for whom english was obviously a 2nd language I was told a refund was impossible. Before discussing it further they hung up on me. After further painstaking enquiries I was informed I could get the refund I was entitled to if I paid 30$ for the ""request"". ImagiNE if you brought some defective goods and had to pay 30% of the purchase price to get a refund. Deplorable and rude customer service in my opinion."
Airport tax is always refundable but travelgenio charge 30$ to process a request for a refund. They're crooks
"Well airport tax is refundable but often airline’s impose an admin fee for dealing with the refund. Then you chose to put an extra layer between you and the airline, so you agreed to paying Travelgenio’s fees too. Unless the tax is a significant amount, you’re not going to see any of it after the fees have been added.Why are you so surprised that a commercial firm is not going to do extra work for you without getting paid for doing so. I’ve seen higher admin fees than $30 by other OTAs."

"Travelgenio is a fraud, and I cannot understand why their page is not shut down.My husband made and paid a reservation with travelgeio ,for him and our son , from Larnaca airport to Athens on 15/11/2018, and return on 17/11. When he went to the airport to get back to Larnaca, on 17/11, he realised that there wasn't any reservation made with Blue air, by their company. His reservation code did not exist in Blue air's list, so theyI didn;t make the flight back.He tried to contact them two or three times and their employees cheated on him by saying that they would arrange a flight on the next morning, but no reservation was made, so he had to book new tickets himselff. What they did is called a total fraud, and we are waiting at least an immediate compensation, otherwise we will use all legal means against them."
"Hi Georgia, we would like to check all the booking process. Could you please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com in order to find out all the details regarding your husbands's booking and issues? Regards"
"georgia, who do you think should shut Travelgenio down?"
"Really bad experience after a connection missed due to previous fight delay, Travelgenio insisted that they cant do anything while airlines directed back to Travelgenio for not having booked directly with them. Had to book new tickets in the end even when we had delay certificate from first journey all boooked under single reference from this company.. PLEASE AVOID REALLY BAD CUSTOMER CARE!"
"Did you have a through ticket or separate tickets? If the former, the airline should have taken care of you."
"Hi Aravind R, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com in order to check the possibilities for your tickets. Regards"
"Hi, someone I know have been charged by TRAVELGENIO MADRID ES on their credit card even though nothing was purchased from them. Looks like they are misusing someone's credit card or their payment gateway is not secure or hacked.very disappointing - lucky my friend figured this out quickly and got their credit card cancelled to avoid future misuse of their card"
That is nothing to do with Travelgenio. Someone somewhere has obtained the card details of your friend and tried to buy tickets through Travelgenio.
"Hi Scenic, please ask your friend to send all the details and the police report in order to check what has happened and assist them to solve it. Regards"
"I also booked a flight in Australia through Travelgenio. They took my money, sent me an email confirming the flight, but when i checked with Qantas a few days later they said the flight had been booked and abruptly cancelled. It is impossible to contact them and they don't reply to anythingDr Michael Mosley"
"Hi Dr. Michael Mosley, you will receive a reply to your mail asap. Thanks"
"it is very bad site very bad serviceit is very bad site very bad service. I have begunn booking a flight wit amount of 102.78 sterling then the airfare has been changed during the booking @ the last step to be 112.45 sterling. the site has applied a special discount on the deviated airfare with 9.58. if you deduct the special discount from the deviated airfare you will get the amount what you have seen at the beginnig, which actually is not a discount. After pruchasing i have found that the special discount amount was not deducted from the total. after many corrospndences with the customer agent. they have decided to not refund me with the secial discount amount because it is only availabe for Maestri Spain Cardholder which is not mentioned before pruchasing"
Hi Milad. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
i have received the same reply as before nothing changed. YOU ARE CHEATING and DECEVEING
You are being replied under mail reference [Travelgenio SL #2109971]. Please follow that mail chain for further details. Regards
"I have tried to contact Travel Genio by phone several times (every time I was put on hold for about 5 minutes and then hung up on). I submitted a customer service request online on their website over 24 hours ago and have not heard anything back. I have a medical emergency (my mother is in ICU on a ventilator) and I need to contact someone about changing my flight and it is absolutely absurd that I cannot get through to someone. I'm not sure what to do at this point, but you should never use Travel Genio since you can't get a hold of them in case of emergency! I know I will never use them again."
"very polite from you to answer, i can't have a clou how ended this but for sure is OK from your site to be present"
"Hi Marianne, of course we can help you with your booking schedule changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and the changes you want to make and we will inform you about the changes possibilities of your ticket rate and, if they are allowed, the conditions for the changes. Regards"
"Finally and after many correspondences I have been refunded with the amount of the special discount , which has been offered on the site during the booking process. Thanks Ana (advance customer agent) from Travelelgenio"
It has been a pleasure Milad. Best regards
"Travelgenio is terrible! They have not one but several service providers for payments, and only one (according to one telephone representative) is reliable. I had the misfortune of getting one of the non-reliable services. I had to switch credit cards from my husband's to mine because his bank had a glitch that put a lock on the limit. So I entered my credit card information but there was no place for the name of the card holder. Hence, the system would not take it. After several calls, waiting period, and two dropped calls, I get a representative (Andres) who told me he could not help me but I could feel free to call again, said ""bye, bye"" and hung up. Fortunately, I eventually spoke with a representative who sent me the link for the reliable payment merchant, and it all worked. However, this was just the beginning of the nightmare. The next morning I see an email indicating that the airline had changed fares so now I owed a few more hundred euros, and then they gave a total amount that was a little less than what I had already paid. So I replied to the email and asked: is the total now the sum of what I paid and the reported increase? Or is it the total amount that you have indicated. The reply was the latter, which means that I had paid that amount already. So I confirm by email that they can issue the ticket for the indicated grand total, which I had already paid (my credit card company had confirmed this). But I call anyway, just to be certain. And then I get Celina, who tells me that I have to pay more, and that there are no supervisors available to help me, and that the best offer she can give me is a reimbursement. I travel frequently and I have used a number of operations but this one is disorganized, does not have efficient operations, the representatives are pushed to get off calls quickly so they have no incentive to help customers and, what is worse, they cannot communicate clearly, accurately, or stand by their mistakes like good, honest, business people do. If you say that the grand total is one amount but you made a mistake, then honor your word. Will you do this Travelgenio and show the community that you are not a scam operation?"
"Hi supertravelistic,please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all what happened and all your doubts and an agent will get in touch with you asap to assist you. Regards"
Gol is the second largest airline in Brazil
And your point is?
"I'm also having troubles with Travelgenio. More than three months after cancelling my flight, I still haven't received any refund. And yesterday, the airline told me that my flight status was still open and that nothing had been done to process the reimbursement! Travelgenio, what's going on?"
"TravelGenio a problem?I am gobsmacked. Who could have seen this coming?Maybe the hundreds, who posted such replies, before you?You did read all the reviews, right?How did you miss the thousands of warning signs?Was it the lure of the ""Cheap Air Fare Fairy?""Her siren song IS strong, but she hooked you too, as she has many thousands before you, though many have warned, and warned, but most choose to not hear their warnings, in search of something, which does not exist.Best of luck,Hunt"
"Hi Jono, our team replied your mails yesterday with the current information regarding your refund status. If you need any further details, please reply to their mails. regards"
"Hi, I too have seen great prices advertised with you through skyscanner, but after reading all these comments I'm not sure what I should do. I have never, ever booked with other agencies except for the company themselves, and now I've been trying to call you, left a message, no reply (I need to know booking class of tickets). How can we know if you're legit? And I can't just book tickets and then hotels and concert tickets if the airplane tickets will be cancelled, in case you're not reliable. But then I really want to gooooo. Sigh. The dilemmas of the avid traveller."
"Hi Effie, we received your mail. We will get in touch with you asap. Regards"
"effie10, they are a legit company but like many of their competitors, they aren't very good. You have discovered this by them not getting back to you, and if you look at the various threads about this company you'll see for yourself what you could be letting yourself in for. The chances of you getting the prices you've seen advertised are low in my opinion.Naturally, don't expect them to tell you anything apart from whatever they think it will take for you to use them. So please take my advice and book your flights with the airline or with a reliable bricks and mortar travel agent."
"Thank you for your reply :) I have received an email from travelgenio, and I have sent them my specific question, but of course by this time the prices I had seen advertised had been gone. It's the only time in my life I'm actually considering not buying straight from the airline, because there's no way I can afford that now. Btw, I see that you're familiar with Swansea? That's the other trip I'm trying to see if I should book now, for business purposes, and travelgenio had offered me much lower prices to/from London, to the point that I should be suspicious? So much lower than anyone else. But then I saw that London-Swansea is like 50 pounds each way! But the flights to/from Bristol are so much more expensive. Any other airports that would be good for Swansea? Thanks :)"

"It's the train that's 50 pounds each way on weekends!! Unbelievable, I know.

I too am trying to get my money back from this dreadful company. It's not a huge amount but it is the principle of the matter that they are holding onto money which does not belong to them. I am trying to find out where I can report them to so if anyone has any information on where to go it would be much appreciated. In future I will check to see if the company is an ABTA member.. it kind of says it all that they aren't.Louise

">>>But then I saw that London-Swansea is like 50 pounds each way! But the flights to/from Bristol are so much more expensive. Any other airports that would be good for Swansea? Thanks :)<<<I'm sorry I didn't see your question earlier, effie. Cardiff is the nearest airport to Swansea, but I often find that price for flying from there are higher than London airports. The question for me has always been whether the cost of taking a train or coach to the further airport, both in money and time, is justified.Mainly I/we tend to choose London or Bristol, but Cardiff works out well for some trips. There's no hard and fast rule, really, it all depends on the fares you see, and they can vary a lot depending on the time that you book."

"Karishmma, Travelgenio ?incompetent yes,useless yes, no customer service yes , lack of contact details yes,cheaper no, fraud probably not. But hey you used them nobody forced you so were does the blame really lie. Sorry I know I’m being really harsh but didn’t you do the slightest diligence before booking?Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hi Karishmma, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"Karishmma, if you just booked, expecting the etickets right away is very unrealistic. They’re not the airline. They don’t hold a stock of airline tickets. When they get your request to make a booking for you, they have to go and try and book those tickets for you. It’s nkt an instant process.They don’t have live prices so 1of 3 things will happen.1. They won’t be able to buy the tickets at the pricequoted, so will cancel your request and the hold on your card will be lifted after a few days or more2. Similar to 1.but they will contact you and ask for more money because prices have gone up3. You’ll be really lucky and they will buy the tickets for you and issue the confirmation Expect their bot to post soon offering to help you with your “doubts”"
"You must learn to type faster, AmoMondo - the bot beat you by four minutes!"
"I sincerely apologize for calling Travelgenio a fraud. I heaved a big sigh of relief when I received my E tickets the next day. However, this was a big lesson to check on the company before making the payment.I appreciate the response from Travelgenio on this forum but would request them to please put the following on their website to come across as genuine:Detailed address of the companyWorking email idWorking Phone NumberThe website (link below) claims 24/7 support but the India phone number does not exist and the Madrid one is only a Fax number which mostly no one uses these days:https:/…254Anyone in my place would feel that they have been cheated, therefore I request Travelgenio to please modify their website with proper contact details"

"I took a flight from Mauritius to Morocco Casablanca, I bought a ticket from travelgenio, my first problem was when I wanted to check online, my booking number wasn't recognised. My second problem (the worst) was during the flight to return in Mauritius, Travelgenio putted the wrong connecting flight so I could not leave morocco. When I called them, they first said: ""It s not our fault but the company emirates"" then they said:""we already notify you that the time for the connecting is not enough"" and then ""they shut down there contact numbers"".NEVER USE THIS SITE, they are thieves, dishonest and crooks. Share this post to protect travellers"
@njara did you not read any of the 500 + posts before yours? They gave the same warning. Your fault for not doing research before booking. Of course your were after a non-existent cheap fare fairy weren't you?
"Hi njara, of course we can help you with your booking details and the info regarding the connecting time depending on the ticket emmisions.. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"

I have seen so many people online that have been scammed by Travelgenio. Companies should not be able to steal money and I'm thinking we need to get together and start an online petition. This company should not be able to operate with these business practices.
"'Their business practices are illegal.' Not really, although they do run close to the edge.Their cancellation policy isn't worth much, period. It's heavily weighed in the company's favour (not unusual), but no matter what Travelgenio or any third party claims, the airline's fare rules will take precedence with respect to changes, cancellations, fare structure and what can and can't be refunded.'This company should not be able to operate with these business practices.' There is a much easier way to put a dent in their business, and that is not to use their (lack of) services. If no one were to go near the website for a week that would have an impact on their slim margins.They to disclose how they operate but where the rot sets in is that few people read the terms and conditions of the third party booking site, and even fewer the T&Cs of the airline. A litlte familiarity before starting the booking process would help considerably."
+1 #540.Fewer still stop to check the reputation of the company they’re choosing to bookmtheir tickets being blinded what they believe is a cheap fare.Still the bot will be along soon to post some fake concern.

"It seems that everyone here has the same experience with Travelgenio. I made 2 separate bookings with Travelgenio via Skyscanner. They seem to offer the cheapest tickets to my desired destination. I purchased round trip ticket to Bangkok. I completed the booking and was quoted at the end of my purchase the amount of SGD252. When the purchase was completed, I noticed in the confirmation page that I was charged SGD270. I did not purchase any add-ons and there seems to be no extra charge to the mode of payment I selected (Credit Card - Master). When I clicked “purchase” I agreed to pay $252 only. Why am I being charged more than what I agreed to pay? Thinking it was just a mixed up, I purchased my husband's round trip ticket to Bangkok right after I booked mine, and this time I made it a point to check the final price quoted before I clicked purchase, it was $251. When theconfirmation page came, it was $256.65. I contacted their customer support and was very unhelpful as well. They told me I might have purchase add-ons or it may be due to the mode of payment I selected despite me telling them that there was no indication in their page that I was being charged extra more than what was quoted to me before I made payment. I know exactly what the price I saw before I clicked purchase. I used a mastercard for both transactions, it did not show that there were any charges for this mode of payment. The extra amount I was charged is tolerable but their business practice is unacceptable. If there are any surcharges they must be transparent to show the breakdown. So buyers beware!!!"
Hi Caren. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards
"Caren, they like so many of these online agents don’t have live prices. They’re also pretty poor when it comes to any kind of service despite their bots attempts on here to prove the opposite. This is what happens when your sole search criteria is cheap and you don’t factor in service, reliability or anything else.Edited: 1 year ago "
"The moral of the story is, as the bots and reps have proven here time and time again, if you want good service, don't go to any online booking site."
"Maybe its just me but its getting harder and harder to feel sorry for people who get scammed with these companies. Wikipedia, google flights, airport websites just no name a couple are great resources to see what airlines fly where you want to go, sites like travelgenio don't always give you all your options. Every airline has a website or app that you can buy your ticket directly from. Even if your able to get a refund in these situations, buying directly from the airline would have prevented almost all the issues people complain about."
"Travelgenio has a very bad after booking service. Basically you can not contact it if you want change something. On its web ii said 24/7 can be contacted by telephone, but it is almost impossible to contact."

May lose more due to their unfair dealing.Support staff are really rude->Lost 45-50 Eur calling them.Why would you guys give support to english speaking countries and hire people who speak only spanish.Tried to book a ticket through travelgenio...The payment was not going through...tried thrice but failed to pay...I waited for 45 minutes..but the payment did not go through...so i closed the tab, had dinner and called my bank..they informed me that the card was blocked due to un-authorized access from two different sites at same time.... then after few question they unblocked my card...Then, I Booked my tickets through the airline directly and instantly without any hassle...The next day at 3 am in the morning, payment for travelgenio was taken and tickets were booked through travelgenio tooo...Now i have two tickets from and to same destination costing 600 Eur...Called the airlines as soon as i saw the tickets they advised me to contact travelgenio as airline has 24 hr cancellation policy..And the game of travelgenio began then...Called them...Waited for 45-50 mins no answer..This continued for 3-4 times...then a spanish lady answered and told ""I no speak english..call again after 5 mins""...called again after 5 mins same thing happened again thrice...Now i have officially crossed the 24 hrs cancellation deadline...now a English speaking guy picks up and receives my complaint...I was relieved...So after 5 days i called them again about the status of the refund...A rude lady(Karima-She worked there for 4+ years in customer support and still was so rude) picked up and without the official confirmation from the airlines even she had guts to mail me that ""In reply to your request, we are sorry to inform you that based on the airline’s fare rules your ticket is non refundable."" So I contacted airlines back, they advised me that the ticked was not yet cancelled from travelgenio side so tolde me to call them again...Now I got a chance to speak to Viviana(Thank God) She patiently listened to what i told and has escalated it to KLM and has promptly sent me a reply...Now i am waiting for the reply from KLM..To travelgenio-> I tried to contact you within 24 HRs of ticket receiving....No one picked up..u guys made me lose more money...and are not processing refund even...WORST AGENCY EVER.."

I have also sent email at their customer service address as well as using their contact form on their website but to no avail.

"Sneha have you read the terms of the fare you bought? Not alltickets allow changes especially the cheapest ones. Even when they do, you have to pay the airline’s fee, fare difference and the agents fee. You’re sometime cheaper buying a new ticket."

Hi Sneha. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Yes, I have read the terms of my ticket.I am allowed to make a change in travel dates by paying a fine of $135 and any applicable fare difference."
Travelgenio is not recommended. I should have read this thread before trying them :( Advised to avoid booking there.
"Hi John, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Travelgenio is a SCAM and has taken my money from credit and yet CANCELLED my tickets. I booked my ticket twice through Travelgenio; the first time they cancelled the flight and then the second time they responded back with a fare that was almost doubled what I booked! I ended up booking through JustFly and the price was only slightly higher and a much better booking experience altogether.
Thanks for your comments Michael. They help us to improve our services. Regards
"Wow, so I can get ahold of you on this forum but the multiple emails I have sent to you asking where my money is have gone unanswered?!?!As I mentioned before everyone, Travelgenio is a COMPLETE SCAM. If my money is refunded as a result of this post I will retract it, but as of now STAY AWAY from TravelGenio."
"Hi Michael, if you need any info regarding your bookings we will be more than pleased to inform you through customer.service@travelgenio.com. If you prefer, send us in a private message your booking code and we will ask our agents to provide you all the info regarding your booking. Regards"
"Travelgenio. You have not answered Michael's question! Why couldn't he contact you by email?Micheal. Do not get your hopes up even though the Travelgenio bot has ""replied"" to your posts. They do NOT read any of the posts and just press a button!"
"You like living dangerously Micheal. First you gambled and lost with Travelgenio, then you took another punt with another shonky ticket flogger JustFly. You may have a booking acknowledgement from them but do you actually have a comfirmed and ticketed booking showing on the airline’s site?"
"We have also been SCAMMED by TravelGenio! We went through booking flights for a family vacation on their website. They had advertised flights at a certain amount, and we entered our payment information. When we received our confirmation, they had charged us an extra 150 Euro than what we were meant to pay! We have been going back and forth, calling their call center daily for over a week, getting hung up on numerous times, and emailing customer service ever few days for the past 2 weeks now. We have sent screen shots of the price as it was advertised. And we are receiving shoddy responses from different people in their customer service center each time. Everyone sends a different answer! How can this kind of company be allowed to stay in business?? I have fully read their terms and conditions, and nowhere does it say they can SCAM customers into paying more than the advertised price. How is this even possible??"
>>How can this kind of company be allowed to stay in business??<<Because people like you throw money at them without doing any research into their reputation.
"""How can this kind of company be allowed to stay in business?""It's pretty easy actually - people such as yourself are too lazy to do any research, and book with the first cheapest outfit they can find. You have a member of TripAdvisor almost five years - all it would have taken is a few minutes' search right here in the forums to expose the many problems that people have had this company. If you had asked ahead of time, we would have been happy to tell you that it is always best to book directly with the airline.If you don't want them to be successful, then don't patronize them - it's just that simple.-JimG"
"Do people here feel that SkyScanner has no responsibility to check on their vendors, to hold them to some kind of obligations just to maintain their reputation and good business practice? I have used SkyScanner for many years and have never had such a bad experience with any of the other vendors."
"Skyscanner does not have ""vendors"" - they are a search engine that supports their site by selling advertising. It's just like your local newspaper - if you responded to an ad in the newspaper and were not satisfied with the company, would you blame the newspaper? If you used a company that you found with a Google search and were not happy with the product, would you blame Google?Nobody forced you to book with Travelgenio - you made that decision all on your own. Next time take some responsibility and do a little more research before handing over your money.-JimG"
"Hi Jess T, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"JustFly actually ended up working and issued us the tickets no problem. TravelGenio has since responded to my emails and have acknowledged they'll be issuing the refund. And Jess, they did the EXACT same thing to me with the pricing and found a ticket that was $1,000 USD over the price of the tickets I tried to purchase. TravelGenio is a super shady company and if it's any indicator from the responses on here you should definitely stay away."
Thanks for your comments MM. They help us to improve our services. Regards
Will we ever see any improvements to Travelgenio's services? Somehow I doubt it...
"Post number 577 had to be a joke! Good lord, if Travelgenio don't already know what to do to improve their services, I despair. Yet another answer from a bot I think!"
"I don't think Travelgenio has a sense of humour, so I can't see it being a joke :-)"
"Yes,Its true that this guys cheat anyway. I had flights but they were connecting and nothing was mentioned about transit visa and I had cancelled both flights but got refund only for one flight. They said that the other flights were non refundable and I had lost 1500$ in this situation. They also do not pick up the calls while we try to connect. I had opened almost 10 tickets. And made 15 calls but only one were answered. I would suggest buy tickets from official sites of airlines. It would be rather comfortable and you would not suffer. Email: trutvik9@outlook.com"
Hi Rutvik. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
+1 this! I'm suffering the same on behalf of my friend who didn't care to check the history of this website before booking his tickets!Edited: 1 year ago 
"Hi Amritbani, please ask your friend to contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com in order to give him/her support. Regards"
same here man..airlines has 24 hours cancellation..But these guys failed to pickup the call and hence cancellation was not raised on time..Now im losing 600€..And they are not willing to accept their mistake...
"Airlines do have 24 hour free cancellation (in the USA but not necessarily elsewhere). That applies only to tickets booked directly with airlines. You made the fatal mistake of booking through a third party, and as a result you lost the right to free cancellation.So while they may well have failed to pick up your phone call, it would have made no difference at all if they had.Just book directly with the airline nest time."
"Hi Dhina, cancellation rules follow the ticket and rate conditions accepted during the booking process, available during all the procedure in order to be checked. If you need any info regarding your concrete booking and allowances, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"""they are not willing to accept their mistake""This is a duplicate posting - dhina complained about this a couple of weeks ago in this same thread.Sounds like somebody else is not willing to accept their mistake of booking with a shonky third party.-JimG"
Yup!!thats my mistake of booking with shady 3rd party...I accept it..
Lesson learnt...I am just fighting for the money lost..
"Contacting you would not change anything. back and forth mails from differnt people telling that its as per rules but the flaw is in your side, your team side, not handling the calls properly. As some one else told..The mistake is just booking using your site.."
"You’ve lost it, just accept it. There’s no one to fight. The 24 hour cancellation applies to bookings made directly with the airline not third parties"
"dhina, you did make a mistake booking via a very poor third party. It doesn't matter what airlines do. You chose not to book with the airline and to use Travelgenio instead. That's it. End of story. There's no point in trying to fight because you cannot win. You just have to suck it up this time and learn for the future.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I booked/paid a flight today thru Travel2be at a $25 discount over the airline price. I received the booking confirmation, then 2-3 hours after I received an email from Travelgenio (most likely Travel2be and Travelgenio are one and the same company) claiming that they could not ""confirm"" my booking with the airline. Of course the ""bait and switch"" was complete once they offered an alternate itinerary for 125 EUR extra (I looked on that airline's website and these flights were in fact $50 cheaper than my desired original itinerary). Of course, I declined their offer (will also dispute my credit card charge if it gets processed) and booked my original itinerary with Vayama (still at a good discount). Stay away from Travel2be and Travelgenio."
"""Stay away from Travel2be and Travelgenio""..... and Vayama and eDreams and Opodo, and Trip.com and Kiwi.com and Gotogate and CheapOair and ExploreTrip and FlightHub and Budgetair and Justfly and eSky and Travel Merry and Travelup and Hop2 and Kissandfly. Who have I missed?"
"Hi OnAir21541117520, thanks for your comment. It helps us improve our services in the future. Regards"
>> and booked my original itinerary with Vayama <<why not book with the airline - have you read any of the many Vayama threads here?Don't be surprised if the same happens
Travelgenio. The main thing your dreadful company has to do to improve its services is to make it easy for your customers to contact you! It really is VERY SIMPLE!!! REPLY to their emails and ANSWER the phone. Just how hard can that be?The replies on here that your bot is posting make the company look more and more ridiculous.
Just looking at booking a flight. Travelgenio came up cheapest.Guess I shouldn't book with them then?
I'm guessing you have read some of the hundreds of complaints on here about Travegneio and have seen that cheap fares are not live and probably do not exist? Always book directly with the airline and save yourself money and a lot of potential problems!
I have! ;)It appears that I am a little more savvy about checking up on companies that I haven't heard of than some others who have posted on here.
Indeed!

Check with the airline.
"Hi gulumozhabes, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"#604, you purchased a flight two days from now and decided to go through a third party, and one of the worst (behind Kiwi) at that?? What madness! Always book directly with the airline, but especially in a last minute situation. Why would you ever put you fate in the hands of such a shoddy operation with so little time to spare?"
"""how can i make sure that i will get in to my flight in two days"" Buy it directly from the airline, would be the normal answer.Now, you have two options:1.) Buy a ticket from the airline. Positive: you will fly for sure / Negative: you may end up with two tickets.2.) Way for Travelgenio. You may end up with 0 or 1 ticket, but not with 2. You might fly or not.""there has not been any payment made"" Is there a reservation on your credit card? A payment is based on a reservation. So even if there is no payment made, there might be one today, if there is a reservation."
"gulumozhabes, have you sent them an email? Please let us know when (or if) you get a response. Too few people return to reveal what happened after emailing Travelgenio."
I have to agree I had the same experience.Travelgenio gave a low price I paid for it but then would not issue a ticket and could not get through to them. Eventually I managed to get through they wanted an additional £139 or they would cancel the whole transaction. But since I had to get on the next available flight I paid up. Travelgenio is a company that conducts business ethically. They give one price which was false and then held me to ransom. Best advice is to avoid Travelgenio at all cost book directly with airline.
"They didn’t hold you to ransom, you could have bought the ticket there and then from the airline.They don’t have live prices /like most of the awful online ticket floggers). The so called cheap price was no longer available or never existed for your dates.The airline’s Website always shows live prices and availability and is where you should buy your tickets in future particularly last minute ones."
"Well, Sprinter, the low price you saw was never really available. Not at the point you made your booking request, anyway. It's a shame you had to learn how these online booking sites work the hard way, but your conclusion that it's best to book direct is spot on."
"Fake pricesFake prices. They show you 60euros cheaper prices for air tickets & in the payment page they charge you more without warning, by changing the total ammount silently. Very rude customer service"
"Hi Origin, if you need us to check the charges made to your booking do not hesitate in contacting us to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will inform you about them. Regards"
"I did it, but you fool your customers. The charges that you show when you select the flight are not the ones the customer is charged AFTER selecting the flight & entering the personal details. And you do this on purpose, otherwise you would inform the user for the extra charge in the step you put it in (which is a step of entering personal details, not a step of selecting charges)"
"Besides that, your Customer Service could not even tell me for which reason exactly I had an extra charge, but replied in general that maybe some credit cards have extra charges and that I should have read the Terms of Service which gives you the right in general to apply extra charges in some cases (!). The thing is that even now, you present a fake price in your site, because if i select the flight I won't have the same price in the final step, without any reasoning to the user."
Without identifying your booking we cannot check the booking process and give you further details. Please send your infos to the provided mail. Regards
"Please don't pretend that this is a mistake. You do this on purpose. I' m still waiting to tell me what is the extra charge for & and why you don't have a warning for this extra charge after entering the personal details. I gave the booking to your customer service, the answer was that mentioned above. Forgot to say that at the end they hung up the phone!"
"Oh dear. Travelgenio strike again. Don't expect any good outcome Origin k.""Of course"" they won't give you a proper answer because we all know the prices they show on their website are NOT the final price customers will pay.Edited: 1 year ago "
"It seems like that..But since we have here ""Mr Travelgenio"" pretending he serves his clients, here is the booking code i gave you: IENNJW & here the ticket number to your customer service #2246857So, ""Mr Travelgenio"" I ' m waiting: a) for your answer why i've not been charged 807€, but 874,61€ at the end, with no warning (please the particular reason for this extra charge) & b) to get the related refund due to your tragic process"
The Travelgenio poster on here is a bot I'm afraid....not a real person.
You will receive a reply by mail during next hours. We send your request to our team with the reference provided. Regards
"'Besides that, your Customer Service could not even tell me for which reason exactly I had an extra charge' Travelgenio is a useless and awful website but the optional fees are explained if you pay attention to them during the booking process.'but replied in general ... that I should have read the Terms of Service which gives you the right in general to apply extra charges in some cases (!).' Reading a contract before agreeing it is a good idea, period. How much more time and effort are you going to spend to try and recoup 63€? Consider it a learning fee, and in future book with the service provider rather than a website guaranteed to supply a 'tragic process' (an accurate description of Travelgenio bookings)."
">>>Reading a contract before agreeing it is a good idea, period.<<<Indeed, I would have thought it was common sense. Maybe it's the way I was brought up in the 50's and 60's that means I don't agree to anything without knowing what it is that I'm agreeing to.The bottom line is that if you agree to extra charges without realising it, you don;t really have a right to complain about it afterwards. Not without looking a bit silly, anyway."
"Please do not buy throught Travelgenio ever! It's better to spend 10€ more on a flight than to have to have to deal with them. This is the worse customer support I ever experienced! Even ryanair has a better service compared to this guys. I bought an Air France ticket and even if Air France would reimbours my flight, Travelgenio doesn't!!!! Crazy! Air France says they will reimbourse the flight but Travelgenio just doesn't want to! I try to send them emails, no answer. I tried to call them several times and after some weeks I manage to have somebody on the phone, a Javier, who didn't gave me his full name. He was rude and told me that they anyways would not answr my email, because they have to much work! What?? Are you kidding me?! Please avoid this agency at all costs! I have just lost 400€ because I wanted to stare 10€ in my flight."
"Pipinha, it doesn’t sound crazy at all. You are not Air France’s customer. You are the customer of Travelgenio. What does it matter what Air France would do? When you purchase through a third party you agree to terms of the airline AND the third party. Surely you read the terms and conditions of the middleman you chose to use, correct? Spending 400€ without doing so would be totally crazy!"
"Hi Pipinha, of course we can help you with the booking cancellation according to the terms and conditions accepted for your ticket rate and airline guidelines. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and telling us if you want to cancel all the booking or just a part and we will inform you about the rate conditions for your request. Regards"
"I have to say that Travelgenio finally gave me a refund for this.They didn't tell me though what was the extra charge for (they sent me again only general statements) & they didn't tell me if they are planning to put a warning for the extra charges like this (they said that ""the prices shown at the availability page are subject to discounts and/or surcharges that will apply according to the payment form selected by you when you do the purchase"", despite the fact that they don't show any warning or even better no extra charge next to the payment method, in order to help you select a method without extra charges. I'm still not aware what the extra charge was for, they only implied that it was due to the payment methods in general.At any case, i believe that making it public it may put a pressure on them in order to avoid such practices in the future and to make them understand that is their responsibility to protect their customers"
Thanks for rating your experience with us. Our goal is our customers satisfaction. Regards
">>>At any case, i believe that making it public it may put a pressure on them in order to avoid such practices in the future and to make them understand that is their responsibility to protect their customers<<<I don;t think they will take any notice at all, sorry. I don't think they care about their customers, and I think their template replies here illustrate that. I trust you won't be using them again. Will you?"
"Yet another awful experience with travel genio / travelgenio.After hours and hours of emailing and phone calls (from a call centre so not cheap) they tell me they never had a seat for me but I could get one if I gave them another 100 euros! (this was already an overly expensive flight one way for 2.5 hours at 160 pounds UK. each phone call I was promised the flight would be confirmed. never was.each communication afterwards told me I'd be reimbursed, finally was (but not 2 days later as promised repeatedly).of course they refuse to refund my bank fees and I didn't even ask about the phone calls and internet fees (I mentioned these in my emails requesting a refund)."
Check you luggage allowance.Requesting a refund for banking and phone fees from Travelgenio? They must have had a good laugh.Be happy if all is fine with your flight and then in future book with the airline directly. It will cost you less money and less stress.
"I won't, because there are other agencies that already take care of these issues. Besides that, there gonna be other clients that will select them, so the pressure on them is the minimun we could do after all."
I have written to skyscanner requesting they no longer include travelgenio in their results page. They will get back to me if they decide an investigation is warrented.
"""written to skyscanner requesting they no longer include travelgenio in their results page""You do realize that Skyscanner is a business that makes its money off the advertising that it sells to companies like Travelgenio?-JimG"
>>written to skyscanner requesting they no longer include travelgenio in their results page<<That is like writing to your local paper asking it not to include an ad for a hairdresser who gave you a bad haircut.

"I have similar bad experience booking with Travelgenio. We needed to amend one of the passenger name on the ticket and Travelgenio always gave the same excuse that they cannot guarantee the name change and blame it on the airline company. The airline company confirmed over email to me that it is Travelgenio's responsibility and ability to process the name change. I called and emailed Travelgenio several times but the reservation help desk is rude and impatient without providing any helpful advise nor can they confirm when they will get back. You can expect hearing excuses such as ""we have sent your request for processing through our internal department but we cannot confirm when and IF they will process it"". Til today, it is still uncertain whether we can take flight or not. Travelgenio is no genuine or helpful in their customer service nor is transparent with the process they take with customers. Telling customers that they don't know to a problem is not solving anything.There is no comfort booking from Travelgenio, highly advise to avoid..."

After pleading repeatedly (your staff was very rude and impatient and kept wanting to push me off the line even though they did not give me any concrete answer, I managed to request for an email confirmation from your staff to say you have started processing the name change, again without confirmation when I will hear back even though i repeatedly mentioned and forwarded evidence (two emails) from the airline company that it is Travelgenio's responsibility and ability to process the name change, there is no restriction from the airline company which will prevent Travelgenio from processing the name change. Is that how you treat your customers?"
">>Is that how you treat your customers?<<Yes. That is how Travelgenio treats its customers. You pay rock-bottom price, you get rock-bottom service."
"Also, they know they can treat their customers in this way because they will still get a stream of people wanting to use them without checking them out first."
"“Is that how you treat your customers?”Not to rub salt in the wound, but it is very well-documented all over the web (this thread alone has almost 700 posts going back to 2016) that, yes, this is the level of after-sale customer care you can expect to receive from Travelgenio or any other sketchy third party middleman. Travelgenio is like a bookie in an old noir movie. They are a shadowy figure in a trench coat whom you found in a dark alley and decided to slip them some cash in hopes of getting a cheaper fare than purchasing directly from the airline. Now you want to make a change and you’re honestly surprised that this scary, shadowy figure in the dark alley isn’t giving you the same level of service as the front desk of the Four Seasons? What reasonable level of care should one expect from a bookie in a dark alley?"
Hi Zek712. We cannot solve anything without your collaboration. Please write to the email address indicated.Best regards.
"Travelgenio.OMG!! Have you actually read post number 642 where Zek specifically says he has tried and tried to get help and has already sent customer services all the details needed to sort this out?READ THE POSTS ....though to be honest there is no need is there, as you have no intention whatsoever of resolving any of the issues for your unhappy customers."
NYC_Ben. I love your analogy of Travelgenio. It is spot on. Great post. Thanks.
>>>We cannot solve anything without your collaboration.<<<Comedy gold!
"I have emailed to Travelgenio at nacort@corp.travelgenio.com; contactrt@corp.travelgenio.com;changesrt@corp.travelgenio.com;customer.service@travelgenio.com(am i missing anywhere else, since i am not getting any clarity where to seek help or who can help).I have called Travelgenio numerous times, your customer service staff are unhelpful and dismissive, they can only say they do not know and cannot help.Travelgenio - I need proper solutions and resolutions not just some empty promises."
"Unfortunately, this frustrating incident has happened. I hope Travelgenio will do the right thing and help the customers, I guess we have all come here to vent our frustration given how painful the process has been with Travelgenio"
"Zek812, Name changes depend on the airline and ticket policy and allowances, that is why during the booking process we ask to introduce them in the same way as in the docs needed for the trip. If you wrote to customer.service@travelgenio.com they will inform you regarding the ticket conditions you accepted and the airline guidelines (as a third party we must follow them) for your petition. Regards"
"Dear Travelgenio administrator, i am not sure if you are reading my previous posts, please check. I already checked with the airline company and with 2 confirmations that it is Travelgenio's ability and responsibility to process the name change, there is no need for authorisation or permission from the airline company to process the name change. I have forwarded the airline company confirmation onwards to Travelgenio staff for their reference.I called Travelgenio several times and each time your staff refused to process my request, saying my flight is in April and there is still time. I do not understand why Travelgenio repeatedly refuse to process and confirm my request? Why do I have to wait until later? It is very unsettling Travelgenio's lack of care for the customer's request and dealings with customers with such dismissive behavior. Again - no practical advice / solution has been given."
"Zek. Travelgenio use a bot on here so no, they have not read your posts...any of them! I'm sorry to say you are banging your head against a brick wall."
All further doubts will be solved by mail. Please reply our mail chain if you need any further details regarding the name change procedures. Regards
"I agree , Travelgenio is the worst place you can book a flight.Stay away from these scammers.They changed a flight that I had booked from Oslo to Copenhagen.Then they lied me right in my Face and Said that Norwegian had changed this flight and not Travelgenio.Stay away from these terrible people."
"Hi kjelltj, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
"kjelltj, Travelgenio are a wretched outfit to be sure, but what makes you think it was they who changed your flight rather than the airline?"
"Yes, beware of Travelgenio on Skyscanner!I recently booked ticket with Travelgenio and my credit card company paid £970 towards ticket. I went to Geneva airport to take the filght, but the airlines told me that my reservation has been cancelled. First I thought there is problem with my payment, when I contacted my credit card they confirmed the payment. Then I contacted Travelgenio, they did not explain why it was cancelled. Between my book and travel there was 22 days. Travelgenio kept my money for 22 days and when I raised the issue money was retunred to credit card company. I had BUY FRESH TICKET FOR NEXT DAY FROM AIRLINE COMPANY, which was last minute and expensive. I lost £1200 towards extra for ticket, hotel booking losses, taxi's to ariport and working days. When I raised the issue they simply sent a mail ""We apologize again for the inconvenience in your reservation.This case is already closed. Any other action is not required from our side"". Attempting to save few ££ booking through skyscanner, some times we might loose lot of money without any protection. These are cheap companies with no responsibility and no accountability. So BEFORE YOU BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIO, THINK TWICE, YOU MIGHT NOT BE HAVING A TICKET WHEN YOU GO TO AIRPORT. THEY DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU LOST TO BUY ANOTHER TICKET, TROUBLES YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH AND ON TOP OF IT THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO EXPLAIN WAY IT WAS CANCELLED. THERE SHOULD BE SOME REGULATION OF THESE ONLINE BOOKINGS.. B.GUJJA"
"They Travelgenio admited that, but did not give the reason or refused to say reasons. On top of it, they kept the money only to return after 22 days. Had they not charged me, that is fine. Had they returned my money its ok."
"There are now 659 posts on this thread, most of them warning not to buy with Travelgenio! There are many more threads on here with the same message! I'm sorry to have to say it but you took no notice of any warnings! However, you have no need to worry as the every busy Travelgenio bot will be along shortly with useless offers of help. It just posts the same answer every time and nobody at the company will have bothered to read your post.Good luck!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hi B. Gujja, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check why it got cancelled and inform you. Regards"
Bingo! That didn't take long!!!
"B.Gujja, You say there were 22 days between when you made the booking request and the flight? In those 22 days how did you not confirm with the airline that your flight was booked? Why were you not checking on the status of your booking several times in those 22 days and certainly in the few days before the flight? What happen when you tried to check-in online 24 hours before the flight?To be honest I suspect your booking was not canceled, but rather it never existed in the first place. Still, you should have been keeping track of your booking. Even when you purchase directly with the airline, you should periodically check on your flight in “manage my booking,” especially in the week before your flight. Why would you buy something through a sketchy middleman and not confirm with the actual vendor that the purchase was made?"
"Thanks, I do not the details, payment was made, booking/ticket came by email, then I went to airport to check in, that is where they said booking was cancelled."
"All the details were sent, always same reply ""We apologize again for the inconvenience in your reservation.This case is already closed. Any other action is not required from our side"", each time a different name appears on the email reply. Any way money I paid was returned to credit card."
Could you tell us your booking code?
"Travelgenio! READ THE POST!!!! They have had their money repaid to their credit card and do NOT..repeat do NOT require any ""help"" from you."
its a second complaint i have hear for this company
What????
I sent an email to customer.service@travelgenio.com and I have yet to receive a response... I'm just wondering if I have to go through this forum to be noticed?
Well their bot will probably spit out its standard offer of help but I doubt that will get you any meaningful help
"Yes I'm afraid you do.Having said that, the Travelgenio bot will push a button and you will get one of their three or four standard and completely useless offers of help.Good luck. You're going to need it."
"Raisa, we received your mail and will be replied during next few hours. Regards"
"Getting noticed by TravelGenio will likely do nothing tosolve your issue- their repeated past history is just to pretend to be concerned and helping, stall around and in the end do nothing. If you paid by credit card complain to your card company and let them deal with it. If you paid some other way, it is unfortunate as you have no one to advocate for you. Let's see what robot generated remark they copy/paste this time."
Thank you for the response. I did receive an email back. I was wondering if I could get a refund on my ticket... it was purchased less than 24 hours ago.
“I was wondering if I could get a refund on my ticket... it was purchased less than 24 hours ago”—-Have you checked to see if TravelGenio have a free 24 hour cancellation policy?
"I tried to look on their website. It didn't say anything about a 24 hour cancellation policy. But to cancel in general, I would have to contact customer service. So I emailed them back. Patiently waiting for a response! I'm sure they get a ton of emails a day, but I'm going to remain positive!"
"'I was wondering if I could get a refund on my ticket... it was purchased less than 24 hours ago.'Travelgenio's policies won't matter in the least in this regard. If Travelgenio actually purchased a ticket on your behalf then the airline's rules will hold as far as changes or cancellation. If you asked hideous Travelgenio to purchase a discounted ticket then it will almost certainly hae been nonrefundable, period.You may be able to request a refund of some taxes and fees but since you chose to buy through a lousy ticket selling website they will charge a fee to process that transaction and you'll probably get little to nothing back."
"""Dear Ms. Cruz,Thank you for contacting our Advanced Support Department.In reply to your request, we are sorry to inform you that based on the fare rules determined by the airline your ticket does not allow changes.We remain at your disposal for any other information you require.Kind regards,-- -- MauroAdvance Support Representative""Funny how it really was a copy and paste response... as I received this twice for both of my emails with two different questions. A little disappointed... but that's what I get for being so quick to judge! Will know next time! Thanks to all who responded."
"Hi Raisa, if you need any further details regarding the ticket rules accepted during the booking process, please reply our mails and we will be more than pleased to provide all of them. Regards"
"Travelgenio. Raisa has said that they got the same cut and pasted reply to two different e mails about different things.As your awful company have no intention of helping people after you have their money, I can not see any sense in you posting on here."
"There's little point in posting the same rubbish over and over again, while obviously not taking any notice of the posts that are being replied to, that's for sure.But I don't care if you carry on, Travelgenio, because it's not doing you any favours."
Thank you as I was going to book a flight. I have never heard of this airline and wanted to find reviews.
"They are not an airline, Christine, they are a very poor online third party booking site, probably amongst the very worst of a bad bunch.I'm glad to see that someone has looked for information about them before handing their payment over. This seems like such a refreshing change :-)"
Stay away from Travelingo. Scamers. Lots o hidden changes. After i click to credit card payment method they are change price from 530 to 590 eur.
"Hi Hacin, of course we can help you with the payment doubts and fare amounts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Hacin. You have got the standard reply from the very, very busy Travvelgenio bot.Please do not expect that they will help you! Next time book directly with the airline. It's really very simple."
"I suspect that if Hacin does contact them, they won't reply at all. If they do it will be to say that there were fees and charges that were agreed to during the booking process, and that will be the end of that."
I have booked a flight with travelgenio to Toronto from the UK and it was listed as being £201 and they charged me £201 so obviously you have done something wrong
Ive booked all my flights through third party companies and have never once had any issues. I bet you're one of those ppl that share posts on Facebook despite being told they are a hoax because its better to be safe than sorry

"I have been upset by my experience with Travelgenio, I had to go to see my terminally ill brother in Australia, money is tight. My health is not good so I booked to travel premium economy and pre booked my seats so I could get up and move around without disturbing other passengers, I paid extra for this service but did not get allocated any of the seats I paid extra for, On my return i contacted Travelgenio to ask for a refund, I was told to complain to the airline and claim from them, I had already challenged Cathay Pacific and the showed me the booking which showed no pre booked seats, I wrote back and the next excuse was the money was to cover insurance, more rubbish I have proof of that amount, so now they ignore my e-mails I feel cheated and robbed"
Don't worry cherril.In no time at all the Travelgenio bot will be along with insincere offers of help. Good luck because you are going to need it!
"Hi Cherril, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the seats selected and the airlines confirmation in order to inform you. Regards"
"Thieves, took a cancellation insurance but they won't reimburse me, even though I fulfilled requirements. Fraudulent scam company. They answer very slowly, and when they do, they're non-answers generated by computers. Makes me never want to book a flight again."
Don’t despair on booking future flights. Just learn the lesson and book directly with the airline. It will make your life so much easier!

"Hi Eva, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com, including the insurance you purchased and we will be more than please to check the conditions and inform you in order to provide all the details for using it. Regards"

Dave. I have a sinking feeling that you could well be right!
"Yes, this may well be samtheexpert with a new, and perhaps more appropriate screen name.Meanwhile, the Travelgenio bot continues to trot out it's usual drivel..."
"The question for Travelgenio:Why do you have the discount for the Mastercard only? I tried to use 2 Mastercards and the payment was declined, moreover the payment was unsuccessful when I used also credit card Master. I have lost a lot of time and as a result no tickets!!! My booking code was ..."
Sofia. You have dodged a billett by not being able to book with Travelgenio. Please now book directly with the airline. Please do not respond to the post that the Travelgenio bot will make asking you to email them for help. You might want to read some of the 700 posts on this thread warning about Travelgrnio.
"I will NEVER use Travelgenio services anymore. Very disappointed! I booked a ticket with Travelgenio on Skyscanner. When I researched, its website said that I have 40kgs included baggage. I wonder about this and checked 2 times. And I also took a screenshot and video on that. All said 40kgs and I decided to book a ticket with Travelgenio. But when the ticket was issued, it has only 30kgs. I contacted by calling them 3 different times. After many times sending emails with attached screenshot and video, one staff said ""at the moment you choose the flight in the list the system showed you 40kg, but at the time you order the booking the system showed 30kg"". HOW CAN??? That is a very funny reply."
I would not trust anything this mob says.
"Not sure about samtheexpert, but one wonders about OOsbhOO and lights - let's say a light with a cyan glow."
"Hi Phong, of course we can help you with the luggage information. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
"Travelgenio.""Of course"" you will not help Phong. If you bothered to read his post at all you would see he has tried phoning and has emailed Travelgenio many time with no response.Your ridiculous and insincere offers of help on here are not fooling anyone and are a pointless waste of time for all concerned. You are though keeping the bot very busy, as it has now racked up almost 3000 posts!Edited: 1 year ago "
99% of which are identical!!!!
"Absolutely agree, Travelgenio is a joke. Flight cancelled 2 months ago and they still refuse to give me my refund! What a joke, by far the worst experience I had with a booking agent."
Surely far better and much safer to not use a booking agent at all?
"Hi wolf8668, Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your rembursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"Travelgenio.""the approximately management "" is not English. Your bot needs to go back to school!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Charging more than what they show initially on skyscanner websiteIncreasing the price at the time of payment. Not able to contact customer support. Not able to get in touch with these. I wanted to cancel my booking but i was not able to do so within 24 hours. I been 2 days now and i dont find any way to contact them. No one is answering the call. I will never book with this company again. Very painful.Also, the price on the Skyscanner website is different and the price when I pay is different. I had to pay 24$ extra than the price shown in Skyscanner.I am not happy with your service Give me back the difference.Want to give negative stars if there is an option."
"Please, please, please read some of this thread. They do not have live prices. This is made clear had you read the terms and conditions rather than mindlessly clicking buy after seeing a low price advertised on Skyscanner. You made a booking request, it came back higher when they had to make the booking. Canceling will see you lose your money. You most likely bought a non-refundable ticket. $24 is a small learning tax to pay."
"If you are only having to pay an extra $24, you have got off very lightly! The Travelgenio bot will be along shortly with the usual offer of help but they don't care because they have an endless stream of people waiting to throw their money away!"
>> I had to pay 24$ extra than the price shown in Skyscanner. <<the skyscanner price provided by travelgenio is not a live priceFor live pricing and availability you can book direct with the airline...once you start chasing non-live prices with shonky third parties you may end up paying more than the airline price

"Well! What do you know! Two posts to the same person saying the same thing, an hour apart!The bot is working overtime today!"
They’re trying to hit the 3000 posts this month!
No doubt about it...they will hit 3000 very soon! 3000 offers of help on this one forum. Just about says it all really.
They may hit 3000 next week at this rate. What a waste of space they are.
I bought two tickets with them to go to Japan. It costed 2 grand for it but at the time i just needed a flight and they were all getting booked fast. Now that i have already bought the two tickets travelgeno says the flight is through areoloft but when i go to their site they say they don’t have any flights to japan that day... so i don’t know what to do. 2 grand is a lot of money to just lose
"You're right. 2 grand is a lot of money, and that's why I like to take great care when spending that amount. I don't really know what to advise now that you've already given this outfit your money, because they are truly terrible."
"Indeed they are Roj but fear not, the faithful bot will be along any minute now with the generic offer of help post. Wow Kayla. That is a LOT of money that you threw at Travelgenio!!!"
"Hi Kayla, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"So, Kayla, have you had anything from Travelgenio and if so have they helped you at all?"
"Kayla, if your story is real (I have my doubts), your solution is simple. Call your credit card company and dispute the charge. Send them the confirmation email from Travelgenio showing what you purchased and then a screen shot confirming that aeroloft has no record of it. Your credit card company will reverse the charge in a matter of days."
"I booked the ticket by travelgenio, it was stated i got discount 29 quids, so my flight would be 527 quids. However they charged me with original ticket fare, without my notice. It was taken out right away from my credit card. Such a scam. :("
If you got a ticket how can it be s scam?
"Hi nopadm, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
I totally with u . I had the same today. I called them. There behaviour is really bad and disconnected my phone

It has now been one hour I am waiting.I need this ticket as soon as possible, as I have paid for it, and I need as proof of leaving Costa Rica by today 8am for my flight to San Jose. Have already sent an email to customer service and called a billion times, please answer me, and fix this asap!Edited: 1 year ago "
""" I need as proof of leaving Costa Rica by today 8am""It seems that you have chosen a shonky third party for something important. That was an unwise decision.If the 8am deadline is critical, buy another ticket directly from the airline. Actually, there is no reason to buy airline tickets from shonky third parties, at all."
"Hi Caroful, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
>> It has now been one hour I am waiting. <<third party booking requests can take 24-48 hours to be ticketed. If you needed a booking (rather than booking request) within that time period the only place to book would. be the airline website
"Hello,I am waiting for a 657,59 EUR refund for my Tokyo tickets since A YEAR (reservation WWB4N8). Multiple emails (more than 50), and they still blame Alitalia company for the delay. We are in 2019 and still no refund of my cancelled tickets (this was an involuntary change of tickets and they said my refund should take 1 month.. . now it's been a year.). My IATA refund number is 0005810814. This company is not professionnal, be careful."
"“I have booked my ticket through TravelGenio”You have done no such thing. You made a booking request, not a booking. If you wanted to make a real time booking with live prices, why didn’t you purchase a ticket directly through the airline? You used a sketchy third party who could take up to 48 hours to provide a ticket."
"Travelgenio is the biggest scam and travel fraud site on the internet at the moment. Buyers beware. We had booked tickets on Swissair to Havana and followed everything online carefully and diligently. The cost was just over $3,400.00When our E tickets were mailed to us the dates were different to what we had initially entered. As a very experienced traveller please note that we had made no mistake.When we called Travelgenio to notify them of the incident we were given one story after another. Eventually we were told that only $900 out of the $3,400.00 would be refunded due to various ""costs"" and"" penalties"".This is a terrible scam site that everyone should avoid.I am seeking help from authorities to try and recover our money. I understand other people have also had similar experiences."
"As ""very experienced traveller"" you should know:1.) not to buy from shonky third parties2.) to make screen shots during the booking process, at least3.) that Swissair was grounded in Oct. 2001 and is defunct since 20024.) that Swiss Int. does not fly to Havana, LX8032 is a codeshare operated by Edelweiss (WK32)If you have proof that Travelgenio changed your dates against unknowingly to you, then I would contact your credit card provider and dispute the charge, unless of course you have agreed to the proposal of Travelgenio already."
"Hi Jamal, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
Hello PhilThank you for the corections. English is not my first language. I wrote with such anger I didn’t take time. I booked on Swiss and yes the flight was a codeshare. As you can see from their response it’s more blah blah and excuses. “The airlines change to alternative dates” since when? That’s garbage. So you do a booking and between the time you press accept and pay and 10 seconds later they email you they have decided to put you an alternative flights without your knowledge or consent. These guys are scammers period.
Please enough with the lies and games . Get me an agent or contact number where I can get my refund otherwise I will take further action including reporting you to the relevant authorities.
Could you please tell us your booking code? Our agents will get in touch with you. The phone numbers are published in the contact section of our local sites. Regards
"""reporting you to the relevant authorities""And which authorities would these be?"
"Beware of Travelgenio!!! they're not a US company so you get ZERO protection. Their website had a glitch when i was trying book, so i called their toll free repeatedly to resolve payment issues. guess what happens when you buy from an 'offshore' 3rd party? they simply drop your call and chargeyour credit card without a travel confirmation w/ out going thru a normal online check out process. i've used many 3rd party travel agents and this is by FAR the worst. The sad thing is, they're never reachable by phone and their email replies are cookie cutters."
"Jamal, please o ahead and report Travelgenio to both your card provider and the internet sheriff's department. They are terrible, and yes, I agree with you that their replies are utter garbage.Sadly, I think you may have to wait a while for a response from the internet sheriff. But hopefully you have evidence that it was Travelgenio messing you about and it wasn't user error."
"John Doe,You are 100% correct about Travelgenio's useless replies!"
"I reported them to BBB and also paypal. I would like ot give them the benefit of the doubt, to think they would be willing to resolve a genuine issue caused by their tech glitch/website. however, their level of response is appalling.."
Thanks John and traveller from Berkshire. Will keep on at them. By the way no email from them as they promised earlier via my inbox.
"Did you pay via Paypal or credit card? i find Paypal and Creditcard/banks a lot more responsive than Travelgenio. one word of caution, if you get nervous and book the flight else where, travelgenio may still charge you (even tho they are not responsive now and can't confirm your flight). this happened to me. I now have 2 sets of the SAME tickets, same flight same date..etc. Travelgenio couldn't confirm my flight in the beginning, so i booked it with someone else. then later on, they 'magically' gets confirmation and charges my card. it's quite pathetic."
"Hi John, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will get in touch with you asap. REgards"
"Completely unethical business. They advertise prices through skyscanner that are not actually bookable.On the checkout page the only payment method that gives you the advertised price is MAESTRO. Every other payment method is 15% more expensive, $214 in the case of my ticket. Much more expensive than other sites. I happen to have a MAESTRO card but the web site does not accept it and upon calling the call center they confirmed that you can't use it on sg.travelgenio.com. I will report this to Skyscanner, Singapore Consumer Protection Authority and every social media site that I have access to. If you are reading this and had a similar experience please do the same. These scammers should not be in business."
"Hi martinSinSyd, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
martin. Travelgenio have just got their bot to push a button and you have got the usual generated rubbish response. If you look back a few pages you will see that they offer this to every single poster...give or take a few different words now and again.Don't believe a word of it. If they were so keen to help people there would be no need for them to have to post on here as a last resort.Good luck because you are going to need it!
"@traveller from UK?Just curious, seems you are a regular contributor to this thread, have you ever booked with travelgenio? Or is your opinion based on all the bash posts from mostly one post wonders?FWIW I booked on travelgenio a week ago and had no issues. I did protect myself with screen shots in the event of a problem. My flight was confirmed within 2 hours of booking and it appeared on the airlines site the following day. My booking code is MYEMTM. I'm not here to shill for travelgenio and I've only used them this one time. Had booking direct been close to the price I paid i wouldn't have booked on an OTA, but it wasn't close."
I am sure you can book a flight on Travelgenio and their affiliated web sites.What is being being criticized here are the unethical methods of click-baiting you with a low fare that can only be booked with a payment method that they don't actually support.
"7Craig. I'm glad you had a good experience with Travelgenio but as you can see by the sheer number of complaints just on this website, a lot of people are not so fortunate! Of course not everyone has problems but a great many seem to.What I object to most is that Travelgenio use a bot to post useless replies, the majority of which are exactly the same and nearly always start with the condescending words ""Of course we can help you with...…"". You can see the bot has now racked up almost 3,000 of these replies and if you read the thread carefully, will notice that no matter what someone says in their posts, Travelgenio do not read them and just push the ""reply"" button. Please tell me if they are so very willing to help out their customers who manage to find this forum, why on earth they can't help them when they email or try to phone? Have you taken your flight yet?"
"@travelerYou refer to the ""sheer volume of complaints""....most of the ""complaints"" on this thread are bogus. There is a very obvious troll campaign targeting all OTA's - take a look at the other OTA threads, the complaints are all the same (beware of, scam, do not use etc). I have even seen the exact ""review"" cut and pasted on different OTA threads. Almost all are written by first time posters. BTW, I do believe the recent complaint by Martinsinsyd is real (one of the few). Also many ""reviews"" contain obvious BS that is entirely implausible.The airlines, who struggle to make single digit profit margins are envious of the OTAs (take a look at Priceline's financial statements to see why). It's relatively easy to start up an OTA, if you understand technology. Also there are very legitimate reasons why OTA' can in fact offer cheaper fares than airlines. Sure they are sleazy with all their overpriced add-ons, and I would also book with an airline if the price was comparable or even just a little more. But it's very easy to book with an OTA and protect yourself from possible scams. No haven't flown yet (my flight is in Oct). But I just got back from a trip using flighthub and just before that a flight booked on buymytrip. Both of these OtA's have similar ""beware of"" threads that are similarly full of nonsensical reviews. I had no issues.Have you ever had a bad experience with an OTA?Edited: 1 year ago "
"""most of the ""complaints"" on this thread are bogus. There is a very obvious troll campaign targeting all OTA's""In your opinion, which is not shared by many regulars on this forum."
"Hi Frommy, this is what they do, they suck in hundreds of legitimate TA contributors like yourself. How many times have you contributed to this thread (and other OTA threads)? They have successfully recruited you to their cause!!Textbook trolling....."
"7Craig. No, I've never used a third party to book a flight and I never will. Regardless of cost, I don't see the point of putting a layer between myself and the airline. Are you saying that virtually every one of the thousands of complaints on TA and other websites are bogus and there is an army of people paid to write them? IMHO there is no need for a troll campaign against OLTAs because there is an endless stream of people lining up to use them.Edited: 1 year ago "
"It's not an army of people. The same person can simply create a new TA profile each time. There would be a company behind it and they pay people to bash (20 cents per post). It happens on forums everywhere because forums don't have the resources to prevent it.Think about it, you have admitted never using an OTA, yet how many times have you posted here advising not to use them? You have thousands of posts, so people listen to you. And there are many other heavy contributors that do the same.The bias on TA is overwhelmingly against using OTA's - this has been brilliantly engineered. And yes as Frommy says this is just my opinion, but the evidence is overwhelming.Personally I will only review or comment on if I have used it myself."
I also once booked by mistake with a third party. It went ok probably like most of the bookings made with third party. However when you have a problem it seems the probability of the third party not solving it or asking for a lot of money explodes. Until then all is well.
"7Craig,Even if (as you say) the majority of these posts are fabricated stories, you have to agree that Travelgenio do themselves no favours with their trite cut and pasted offers of help. Please tell me why they even bother to reply to these made up posts."
"Hi traveller,I have posted here only recently (in the last week). I suppose because I recently booked with them so the thread caught my interest. I guess I should ask you why you bother with this thread since you have never used them?I actually emailed them shortly after my flight was booked asking why my confirmed flight was not showing on air China's website and they replied quite promptly (same email as this thread). And my flight did appear on Air China's website the next day.I do agree though that all these OTA's do themselves no favours by pushing over-priced add-on's that are obviously a rip off. I had to decline about 6-7 such offers.Also IMHO many of the airlines are no better with shady practices. I once booked a flight direct with Air Canada for my mother. She gave me the wrong date and I discovered the error within a few days and the flight was almost a year away. What I had to go through was appalling. I had a more recent poor experience with a direct Air China booking. So sure the OTA's aren't great, but the whole industry needs a shake up IMO. Can you imagine ordering something custom from home depot and then calling to make a change the next day (well before they had commenced anything). They would not hesitate to accommodate you and wouldn't think of charging you extra."
"I'd also like to add of my recent and terrible service with Travelgenio.I thought I had booked a flight last week from India to London via Skyskanner. Travelgenio was the first available flight on the list of options. I followed through and booked the flight with no initial problem. I got to the screen with the statement 'booking confirmed' and got a follow up email with all my flight details promptly, telling me that my booking was confirmed and that my ticket would arrive in 24 hours. When I didn’t get my tickets or any subsequent correspondence with reference numbers which were recognized by Etihad (as would happen normally) I got concerned. I did get an email with a breakdown of fees which didn’t resemble what I had paid and also requested me to confirm that I wanted the ticket. I emailed back saying I did require the flight and was unclear about what the email was requesting or telling me. When I got no response I emailed again and then I called. The first time I called (it was a UK 0870 number) and eventually got through the long menu, I was connected to someone who didn’t speak English who asked that I dial in again. I after asking if I couldn't just be transferred to someone, I could not. I called again and the next person I spoken to informed me that my payment hadn’t gone through and as I hadn’t contacted them, my flight had been cancelled! I questioned why I had not received an email stating this, but they were unable to respond.The whole service a scam and the team were unapologetic, unsympathetic and dismissive of the fact that their processes are fundamentally flawed. Surely Skyscanner has a duty in this, otherwise they are also complicit in this scam?"
"Hi Vicki R, of course we can help you with the booking process if needed. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"What sort of duty do you think Skyscanner has? If it's to protect you by checking out companies on your behalf, I;m afraid you're sadly mistaken. They are a business, not a consumer protection site, and they are there to make money from companies that want to pay them to appear on their site.That's really all there is to it.Even if they were in existence to protect people, I'd still much prefer to protect myself by doing my own due diligence checks into who I intend to give my money to. I don't trust anyone until I'm convinced that they can be trusted, and I suggest you start doing the same."
"Vicki, they don’t have live prices (and neither do most of the shonky ticket floggers who advertise on skyscanner). They won’t tell you that though. They will come up with rubbish excuses, like the payment didn’t go through. What they really mean is the prices have changed and they couldn’t buy a ticket at what they quoted from Etihad. You didn’t book a ticket with them, you made a request for them to go and book a ticket.Do yourself a favour and go to Etihad’s site. It easy to use, they explain clearly what’s included in each fare type and the prices Nd availability are liv. When you finish the transaction you’ve actually booked your ticket and will get the confirmation and e-ticket pretty quick."
"@7craigI have posted on this thread and can confirm 100% that Travelgenio is a scam. I booked a same flight from them two separate times after the first one was cancelled by travelgenio. The second time I booked I received a confirmation email and then a day later they came back saying they couldn't honor the flight but then offered a similar flight that was $1,000 USD more than the original.Now, you would say that could be two bad experiences but then after going through that debacle of not getting the tickets I wanted. Travelgenio then never refunded my credit card for both of the flights even after multiple emails to them asking where my refund was. It wasn't until I posted on this forum that I finally received a response from them stating they would refund my money. And that wasn't the end of it.Travelgenio only refunded one of the flights so I had to file a fraudulent claim against them through my credit card company to receive the remaining refund. Like I said, and clearly I'm with the majority on this post, that Travelgenio is a scam and whack company. In all reality you're the troll trying to stick up for a bogus company and undermine the integrity of people posting about this problem. Continue using Travelgenio and you will get burned."
"After booking a ticket on Travelgenio they then requested I go out and scan my credit card, passport and utility bills before they would honour the ticket how dare they !!! when i promptly told then it wouldn't happen they cancelled the ticket avoid this on line agent if you can at all costs and secondly the agents do not speak ENGLISH Absolutely awful service"
"Hi Chris, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"""Surely Skyscanner has a duty in this""What duty would they have? Skyscanner just offered you the option of booking with Travelgenio - it was your choice to use them and it is your responsibility to do the research ahead of time to determine that they are a company that you want to do business with.Suppose you saw an ad in the newspaper for some type of service, and you engaged the company to do some work for you. They botch the job. Would you expect the newspaper to have a ""duty"" in that case for running the ad?It amazes me that people will do more research before purchasing a tube of toothpaste, than they will before buying flights that cost 100s of dollars. They only reason these booking sites stay in business is because people are lazy and buy the first cheapest flight they can find. I have no sympathy - they are the authors of their own misfortune.-JimGEdited: 1 year ago "
"I have had the same experience. I used Skyscanner to search the best deal for my flights, Travelgenio showed cheapest so went through to their site but the actual charged was not only above what they said it would be on my Skyscanner search but well above several other providers who had declared honestly what they would charge on Skyscanner.Never again."
"What does Skyscanner have to do with any of these complaints about Travelgenio. They show routes and act as a search engine with paid adverts, much like google. No one says, “I followed a link through google, so therefore google must be responsible for them.”Skyscanner actually disavows any responsibility for the links that show up. The onus is on the customer to research and choose the best option. A failure to do this is the fault of the customer alone."
"Hi Lisa, Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"From Skyscanner website:""We make every effort to ensure the information you see on Skyscanner is accurate and up to date, but very occasionally there can be reasons why the price is not represented accurately on the site. If you see a price difference between Skyscanner and a flight provider, please contact us with all the flight details (from, to, dates, departure times, airline and travel agent if applicable) and we will investigate further. Just select “price difference” from the “What is your message about?” dropdown menu on the contact us form below.""Also all flight providers are vetted by Skyscanner before they can appear on their site.And Skyscanner tracks user satisfaction with each flight provider. FWIW travelgenio has a 4 star rating from over 2700 responses.So not really relevant comparing to Google.Edited: 1 year ago "
7Craig.You say people are paid to slate Travelgenio etc so maybe there are also people who are paid to write glowing reports about them? Surely it must work both ways?Edited: 1 year ago 
"Yes of course there are phony/paid reviews both ways. It's big business. I mentioned the 4 star Skyscanner rating in the context of FWIW - who knows how reliable that is. My point was that Skycanner does apparently care about the integrity of the flight providers on its site.I'm hardly shilling for Travelgenio though. My ""review "" is more neutral than glowing. I got what I paid for with no issues.....but I may never use them again. All things being equal I would go with Expedia."
"Craig you are giving Skyscanner too much credit. They might go through the motions of “caring,” but the only thing they’re worried about are profits, and those come from the big advert bucks they receive from the likes of Travelgenio, Kiwi and directly from the airlines too. Airlines and travel companies must be some of the most complained about industries on the web. Do you really think that if enough people complained about Air France to Skyscanner that Skyscanner would ever consider taking them off of their site and put a stop to the revenue they bring in from Air France? Skyscanner may log the complaints, but it’s a formality."
"How people spend their money is none of my business, but what is sad is that many people do zero research on the OTA they are handing their money over to and do not read the terms and conditions. It is not in Skyscanner' or any other price comparison websites to BOLDLY warn customers that they must research the OTA as well as read terms and conditions before proceeding with handing over their money. There are a number of reasons I would not use Travelgenio but here's one as an example... their T&Cs state that they will charge a fee of 50 Euros if I wanted to cancel, modify or get a refund on British Airways flights which is the airline I mostly fly. This 50 Euros fee is in addition to whatever the airline charges."
Well done - I am going to take a guess that the majority of people that read the t&cs would stop at that point. It seems pretty obvious that the majority of Travelgenio customers never read the terms they are agreeing to
"@ben totally agree with you about Skyscanner, I didn't mean to be sticking up for them.Also agree with you about the airlines and travel industry in general. I have had appalling experiences dealing directly with airlines, it's no wonder that OTAs have poor reputations. For example, correcting the spelling of your name should be no big deal regardless of who you are dealing with but they all use any excuse they can to gouge you."
">>all flight providers are vetted by Skyscanner before they can appear on their site.<<Nonsense. The only vetting is whether the advertisers' payment is honoured. Skyscanner will accept any advertisement, just like your local newspaper does. There is no checking."
"Skyscanner will only care if their revenue and profits are at risk. A lot of airlines will make minor name corrections without any penalty if you make a mistake and let them know straight away. I believe even the generally disliked Ryanair do this.It doesn't happen with third parties because that's where they make money. They don't make much from selling the tickets, if anything at all."
"Unfortunately I have a similar problem with Travelgenio when I tried to book a flight from this website on 16.3.2019. After entering all the personal and payment information and trying to buy the ticket with my credit card, the website gave me error that ""Your payment was not successfull. please check your payment method details and try again"". I entered all the credit card info again and clicked on ""buy"", I received the same error. And it happened several times. Be aware that it always said ""Payment was not successfull"". Then I was disappointed that I can not buy from this website and I bought the exact same flight from Opodo, on the same day. After a few days I saw that the amount was reduced from my credit card by Travelgenio, while it was giving error that payment was not successfull. Then I checked my spam email and I saw that the ticket was sent in my spam email. I called them today as soon as I saw it, the person in the call center first said he speaks Spanish and Portugese and he could speak in English but not very well. When I explained the problem to him, he checked and said that the payment is Ok. I insisted that the website never confirmed the booking, he said that he does not understand me and he does not speak English very well. I asked him that I want to talk to their manager or someone who speaks in English, he said it is not possible. I did not find any email address on their website, just a Contact Formular which I sent my message to it, but I am not sure they even care!! please help me if you have ideas.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hi Ghazaleh], of course we can help you with your booking and its confirmation time. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Ghazaleh #794, your experience has again sadly highlighted another of the many reasons I would only hand money over to Travelgenio as a very last resort... they are based in Madrid Spain, and as their website states they are subject to Spanish law, and as you are finding out customer service agents may not be fluent in English. If they refund, they will not refund their service fee (however much that is) or the minimum 30 Euros cancellation fee on top of whatever the airline charges. Then having contacted them as the suggested by the automated message from Travelgenio be prepared for a very long wait for a refund if you get one at all. You might want to check the Opodo conditions for cancellation and see if you can get a refund from them easier and faster than Travelgenio but that too carries risk. Ensure with the airline that Travelgenio has purchased a ticket on your behalf before cancelling with Opodo,and remember Travelgenio could cancel your ticket with the airline anytime before travel and you are stuck. Hope somebody else can offer you some constructive advice."
It is pretty hard to imagine any successful outcome with two of probably the bottom five gutter dwelling ticket floggers involved.
"How could one ever need to use them even as a last resort?They’re rubbish, have been for years and the attempts their bots makes to try to show they care is hilarious.Even if they were the only agent left on the planet, you still would never need to resort to using the . The airline will happily sell you tickets on their flights. You can see what you’re buying and if something happens, you speak to them directly."
"Travelgenio and Opodo? Good grief, are you determined to throw money away?"
"do not book with Travelgenio! they are a scam.we had bad experience (march 24, 2019) where they never issued/reserved a flight for us from Vancouver to Calgary. we hope that you avoid this company at all cost!!"
"Hi Alex, thank you for sharing your experience. I'm sorry you had a tough time with Travelgenio. Next time, book directly with the airline to cut out the middleman. However, there's no need to post this 6 times on the forum. This could be considered spamming."
"Alex, please stop spamming the forums."
"Hi Alex, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check if there were any incidence during the booking process or the tickets confirmation and inform you. Regards"
"Just as Alex spammed all the Travelgenio threads, the bot responded to each and every one of Alex’s posts!"
"The bot must care more than the company does. Maybe it is developing a personality, lol!"
It just proves what we always knew! Travelgenio staff do not read the posts.I can guarantee if one of us posted that we had a problem....the bot would reply to us too!Edited: 1 year ago

"@traveler oh come on, don't be so gullible, #807 is pure BS. There is no way that would happen. Your contract with an OTA is the purchase of a specific flight, if that can't be fulfilled the transaction is nullified. And even if something preposterous like that did happen you would simply contact your credit card company."
"You are entitled to think a post is BS if you want to, just as others are entitled to believe differently."
7Craig.Once again you seem to be defending Travelgenio? Who's to say what posts are BS?Edited: 1 year ago 
"7Craig - If the post is total BS, why does Travelgenio think it is worth even an automated reply here?"
"I have no idea at all whether it's BS or not, but I assume posts are genuine unless proven otherwise. In this case, I can easily believe what was posted."
"I have unfortunately fallen into the same scam with Travelgenio. On the 1 April I booked a domestic flight between Istanbul and Keyseri For 6 April. I did not get a confirmation of my ticket even 24 hours later! Therefore, I emailed them asking them not to deduct from my card the ticket payment. Contrary to my instrucions on the 3 April they had deducted my account of Euro 53. Meanwhile on 2 April I had also purchased another ticket thinking that they were not going to issue a ticket to me since it was 24 hours later. I booked directly this time through the airline and it was about 50% cheaper! Wrote to the company asking why they deducted my account since I had written to Them to refrain from doing so and to refund the payment already deducted without my approval. Never received a response.On the 5 April, they deduct Euro 9 from my account even without my expressed approval!! I don't even know why this amount was deducted! How more unprofessional can you get!? Wrote to them again inquiring on this in addition to the previous query. Having now read all the comments regarding this company, I am extremely vary and can only kick myself for being such an idiot to go through Sky Scammer and this company to book my ticket! I would warn everyone, please stay away from Travelgenio, for your benefit. They can really end up messing with your flight plans. Not to mention the added worry."
"Hi Lakmali, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"Lakmali, On April 1 you did not book anything. You made a booking request. The request can take up to a few days to fulfill. Knowing this, why would you place a booking request with them when your flight was only 4 days away? Seems crazy to me. It seems like they were able to fulfill your booking request that you set in motion. They abided by the terms and conditions- terms that you attempted to break. Travelgenio is a shoddy company, but they did what you asked them to do. I don’t see where they are a scam."
"Booked my flight last week from Singapore to Jakarta. Do the first research on skyscanner website, comparing which travel agent is the most cheap amongst the others. Find out that Travelgenio is the number one cheapest flight, then i'm directly go to their website. Fill my name and also other information, proceed to payment that they have sent to my e-mail. Input my cc with no doubt (because i always use skyscanner to comparing price and never never had an bad experience to book with their agents). Find out, that the step 4 (if i'm not mistaken, the payment confirmation tab is always loading!). I got my nerve on since that moment. My mistake was not googling the travel agent first before made my payment! In the other side, i always satisfied with skyscanner's services before. Find out there's many many person suggest NOT to book via that apps because it's a scam or bad company, etc etc. Panic attack at that moment! Because i am in a rush and urgently to get my ticket, i'm booked with the most famous travel agent in southeast asia, travelok* apps, and i got received my booking shortly. Not finish on that, i call my bank to ask them is there any transaction on my cc and they said yes there is transaction both from travelgenio and travelok*! (but the payment is not completed yet until that time i call the bank, i'm still waiting for the email confimation also, but there's no new email after many hours of wait)After such a long prayer and waiting, finally i got a reply from Travelgenio that said my transaction was successful (after more than 2 hours of waiting) BUT there's no invoice nor e-ticket on that confirmation email! After that, i made a call to the airlines to ask whether the booking number is ok to fly/no. They said that the booking code is done with the payment and the airlines send me the e-ticket and the other booking is very very easy to reach and refund my ticket from travelok* apps was very easy. Such a professional company indeed! Lesson learn : yes, as we know skyscanner always show us the cheapest flight on the day you've searching for, but not all of the travel agent in their apps have same professional attitude to deliver their service to you. I would say that i am lucky enough to get my bookings done with them, since we know many of you got failed booking but there's a bill in your card, so please be careful with the company like this, as we also known that there's many bad report for this company. Better to booked with big names agent or the airlines website itself, even tough not the one that skyscanner suggest as the cheapest one!Edited: 1 year ago "

"Skyscanner didn’t “bring” anything. They are essentially a search engine- like google- on which companies pay to advertise. Skyscanner is clear in its terms that they neither promote, recommend nor standby any of the companies on their site. They are merely like a newspaper in which companies place advertisements. It is up to the customer to research and evaluate any company before handing over hundreds or thousands of dollars. Travelgenio is truly terrible (they don’t have live prices), but there are thousands of complaints all over the web going back years with this warning."

"#833 - Safari48284,Thank you for returning to update the thread. Glad that your issue was resolved.Whilst rightly or wrongly, Travelgenio gets a fair number of complaints on TA, they are responding to most complaints that are raised, or at least acknowledging them and asking those to make contact directly with them. I agree however that the standard robotic like repeated replies do not however look good.On the complainants side, few posters bother to reply and update from their initial complaint. I suspect many do actually have a satisfactory outcome or the original complainants would be back. Many I guess just want to vent. Others perhaps can not be bothered to update and acknowledge their problem as resolved which is a shame.Complaint wise many issues do seem to be from those have either bought the wrong ticket type for their needs (having likely only search on the parameter of “cheap air ticket to xxxx”) and many have created a mess themselves through data entry issues. Sometimes, just sometimes, it seems Travelgenio can’t do right - at least in the eyes of some of their customers."
Travelgenio….Post number 834 is pure genius!!!! You can not be serious!!! I'm sure Travelgenio use bots because very few right minded people could work for such a dreadful company in all good conscience!
I wish more people would return and update the threads they have posted in with the outcome. Then we might have a better picture of what is going with Travelgenio after their bot posts here.
"I booked through travel genio for jet airlines which got shut down it was a round trip. but the return ticket was for china southern. i just came to know that airline is no longer operating, nobody emailed or anything. I called jet airways they said call the travel agent we will refund the money to them. I called travel genio, first two agents were very rude, third one simply said no English call back. If it was a round trip they should be returning me the whole money so i can book another ticket. they said use the return and book new ticket for going there. i am okay with that too. But i got no surety yet that i will get my refund or not they are saying that they dont know anything. call back after week. I am emailing them but getting no repose. I didn't search about them before booking because i been booking online for forever."
"Hi Aman, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Hi i did sent an email the booking code is THXSGD, please reply on email too. Thank you."
Hi Aman. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"RojBlake I’ll let you know what has happened. I posted on here before about my terrible experience with TravelGenio. I had to file a claim with my credit card in order to get my money back. TravelGenio has challenged this and provided a false response and according to my credit card This is standard practice among these fraudulent sites. I have now had to submit additional paperwork to prove my claim. All this is doing is taking up more of my time. Moral of the story, DO NOT USE TRAVELGENIO."
Even we are very upset with Travelgenio portal. While booking a flight we got a cheap deal with this portal we booked the flight but unfortunately it was of jet airways. As the airline is shut we have called Travelgenio customer care service multiple times they only tell to wait and hang up the call. Even when we mailed for same they keep on raising new tickets each time with same message contents. When we called Jet airways for help they asked us to take conference with Travelgenio customer care we did that as well they just listened to the jet airways person and simply hung the call saying you will have to wait. Very devastating service. Will advice all not to book the flights from this portal. Least helpful service.
"Hi Bhagyashree of course we can help you with the info we currently have for the Jet Airways flights solution, the ones the airline provided us through the systems. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap with all the details. Regards"
"saddest 85 pages ive scrolled in my life, thank god i never use such scam sites, i wonder how spanish government allows to function, or theyre just pretending to be in spain but registered in some off'shore heavenEdited: 1 year ago "
And what could the Spanish Government do as no laws have been broken.
"its called fraud, i tought Spain is more or less law suited country, they know to find an inch in taxes but ccant find anything inside some companzy for which out of 85 pages all 85 were negative??? something is rotten there then"
"“its called fraud, ... something is rotten there then”—-It’s not fraud, it’s a case of the buyer not knowing what they are purchasing. Also, they expect full customer service for the supposed cheap deals they are bagging, and then when they want to make changes to their booking, complaining about the fees they agreed to at the time of purchase. Welcome to the forums, but I hope you’re not just going to start posting like this on every thread there is?"
"its fraud, thanks for welcome, i just forgot my email and pass cause i was away fro quite a long so had to open new one, enjoy :))), i know travel ""things"" very good, on the road since 1995"
It’s neither illegal nor fraudulent to provide poor customer support. The customers picking them do so on price only. How they think you can buy a product from a company where they’re making almost nothing on the sale but miraculously have fantastic servjc. It dies the work like that in the real world. You buy cheap you get cheap. A lot of the complaints come down to their customers making mistakes in the booking process or not knowing what they’re really buying.They’re certainly hopeless although the bot can be amusing at times.
"okk, converstations like this always lead to bla bla one to another so illl stop, havea good day or night"
"What Travelgenio - a poor operation I wouldn't ask to help me find my way across the road - does is not fraudulent, and your claims of that are inaccurate. The terms of their services will have been checked by their legal team to ensure they operate within the law even if only just.As mentioned here and on other threads about third party booking websites, the biggest problems happen when people looking for 'cheap' fares pay no attention to the fare rules of the airline or of the operating terms of the ticket seller. They then complain that they've been scammed or the company is a fraud, but that's usually not the case. That those who complain didn't know what they were buying is the foundation of the problem, but that's another matter.'i know travel ""things"" very good, on the road since 1995' It's not a contest, but others on this forum were seasoned travellers long before that time."
"whats your point? i dont get it abd travekgebui us frazdm we cab dusczss other thing but i preferr private trough PM or email as i dont like spam, abd im in Vancouver alsoEdited: 1 year ago "
"The point of a public forum is to discuss things, well, publicly. I don't think you'll get many takers for having a private conversation about Travelgenio or third party booking sites. That isn't going to help anyone else. Though to be fair, all of the reports and warnings here don't really have any effect, either."
"I booked my ticket using Travelgenio on May 13th 2019 and paid for my booking using PayPal. The transaction went through and PayPal has accepted the transaction. They have been waiting for Travelgenio to accept the pending payment. In the meanwhile, I have received multiple emails from Travelgenio Fraud Service letting me know my payment is unsuccessful and my booking will be canceled. I was sent a link to make the payment. This link does not work. I used all the Credit/Debit cards I own in order to make the payment. I called up the Banks and they let me know there was no problem on their side. That Travelgenio needs to accept the payment and there is nothing more the Bank can do.I hhave spoken to the Travelgenio customer service about 10 times in the past 4 days. I have received varied responses. 1. Your payment has been confirmed. No transaction needs to be made. 2. No payment was made. You need to pay the amount using the link sent.3. The ticket will be cancelled if you don't pay the updated price. I called them up today as well. I wanted to speak with a manager in order to solve this issue. I keep receiving threatening emails regarding the cancellation of my ticket. I have tried to make the payment more than 50 times using the link provided. But IT DOES NOT WORK.Hoping to solve this crazy issue soon.EDIT-After calling them today and telling them I will post this issue on TripAdivsor, they accepted the PayPal transaction ASAP. Please be aware of their tricks and fraudulent behavior before you purchase a ticket.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Vanshika, instead of calling useless Travelgenio, have you conctacted your bank to see if the payment has been processed? Have you checked the airline's website to see if a ticket has been issued?If the payment hasn't been processed and/or if there is no ticket at the airline's website then be grateful for this. Contact PayPal (I'd not want to use them either, but that's another matter) and say you no longer want to complete the transaction.Then do what you should have done in the first place, which is to book the ticket directly with the airline."
"Hi Vanshika C, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation details. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"Vanshika C #855 You said that "".... After calling them today and telling them I will post this issue on TripAdivsor, they accepted the PayPal transaction ASAP...."" I am not convinced that the veiled threat of posting your review on here moved them into action as 86 pages of largely negative comments will attest. More than this, I suspect that you only found this forum after using all your credit and debit cards to make the payment and calling them 10 times- which I must say I find remarkable. I do hope that they make the booking for you and I would suggest reading all of their terms and conditions because you might have need to engage with them again."
It would be best that they don't issue anything and you keep your funds so you can book directly with the airlineDo you really want to do business with this company?
Hello @TravellerPlusI have mentioned in my post that I spoke to the Bank. I was on the call with my bank while making the transaction but the transaction kept getting denied. The bank asked me to call Travelgenio and resolve the issue. The price of the ticket given by Travelgenio was better than the other websites. But the customer service and their bad payment gateways were what made the entire process longer than required. Travelgenio took over 5 days to accept the PayPal transaction. I had even sent a screenshot of the PayPal transaction to Travelgenio. But they kept telling me to pay again with my Master or Visa card.
>> The price of the ticket given by Travelgenio was better than the other websites. <<you may be mixing up the 'advertised' (non-live) price with the price they can actually sell you a ticket for (they don't have stocks of tickets - they still need to get them from the airline)
>> The price of the ticket given by Travelgenio was better than the other websites. <<I think you also need to consider if the lower price is really worth all the extra trouble and aggravation dealing with a 3rd party online ticket agent.
"#860... Unknown... you state that the price given by ""Travelgenio was better than the other websites..."" assuming you get ticketed etc, was the saving worth it?"
"I FEEL FOR YOU. They send a confirmation email after they have you put in your payment details, so, of course, you would think you have confirmed your booking. NO. OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS. Then you’re meant to go through a 3rd party website to book it officially. And within a day or two of the booking “confirmation”. Do you think they word that expressly in their email? THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS. Does another 3rd party website do this? NO, but you are expected to know that ridiculous “you’re confirmed but not confirmed” policy. And do you think they follow up with you to check if you will make the payment or else LOSE YOUR TICKET. That is again, apparently ridiculous to Travelgenio. I will never book with them again, and I advise you to not do the same."
"“Then you’re meant to go through a 3rd party website to book it officially.”Wait, what? You’re saying that Travelgenio made you go through another third party (a fourth party?) to make the payment/final booking? Which third party are you claiming Travelgenio used? You would have a booking through that agent and not Travelgenio then. Regardless, it’s not that difficult to realize you’re making a booking request and not a booking if you read the terms and conditions and pay attention to the exact verbiage in the confirmation email. Five minutes of research would have shown you that Travelgenio is one of the worst third parties out there. I’m honestly very curious about this supposed third party Travelgenio sent you to!"
"Hi Rosalind if you need any info regarding the purchase and confirmation process, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"worse company every. I booked a flight with them and once I was checking out, they offered a service to add baggage to my flight for an additional cost. I purchased it and when I confirmed with the airlines, they advised me that baggage was no included. Called travelgenio and had one customer representative hang up on me. Called again and another customer representative just laughed and told me baggage wasn’t included and he didn’t see that extra service on my booking. Honestly stay away from them so they don’t scam you!"

"DOUBLE BEWARE OF TRAVELGENIO ON SKYSCANNER !!! I unfortunately didn't come across this review until after booking with Travelgenio. I must confirm Travelgenio's hidden and high fees. The agency wasn't -clearly- upfront with extra fees, and the various fees were steep. I had to pay a lot for -one- piece of checked luggage, more than the standard airline rate. Plus, the cancellation fee was cleverly high so that people shy away from cancelling, even if dissatisfied. Communication with Travelgenio agents was a waste of time - they only repeated the same blurb and pointed to the small print. Skyscanner should -not- work with such dishonest agencies. I'll never book with Travelgenio again, and it's sure that I'll pass on the word that Travelgenio has zero interest in customer service."
">>Skyscanner should -not- work with such dishonest agencies<<Like all commercial web sites, Skyscanner will accept advertising income from any source, and does not check up on its advertisers. Just like your local newspaper does not check its advertisers.>>it's sure that I'll pass on the word that Travelgenio has zero interest in customer service<<There are already many hundreds of warnings about Travelgenio on Trip Adviser. Why will yours make any difference?"
"Hi Lavinia, we will be pleased to check the luggage policy of the rate selected and the cancellation conditions accepted during the purchase and booking process. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you. Regards"
">>>unfortunately didn't come across this review until after booking with Travelgenio.<<<I expect that's because you didn't check them out first. A simple Google search on 'Travelgenio complaints' would have revealed plenty of them, and this very thread would undoubtedly have been listed somewhere - amongst many others.>>>Communication with Travelgenio agents was a waste of time - they only repeated the same blurb and pointed to the small print.<<<It's not just Travelgenio. The majority of online booking sites will have very poorly paid, very poorly trained and unmotivated staff in support roles who can only read what the screen in font of them says. That is the inevitable result of the business model.>>>Skyscanner should -not- work with such dishonest agencies.<<<Skyscanner is simply a tool that allows people to compare prices. The bad thing about doing this is that a lot of very poor booking sites will be in the results. So it's use is pretty limited.On top of that, it's not a good idea to solely book on price alone, as you've now discovered. Finally, what Skyscanner is not is a consumer protection site which vets and approves companies so that travellers don't have to protect themselves by doing their own checks."
i have been cheated the same way just now. Skyscanner is also a cheat by supporting websites like these. Travelgenio charged me 4000INR more than the price mentioned on the final booking page.
>> Skyscanner is also a cheat by supporting websites like these <<are newspapers cheating by carrying paid adverts from these companies?is google cheating by showing paid adverts from these companies at the top of searches?If you choose to do no research before handing your money over how would you know if you were dealing with a reputable company?
"“Skyscanner is also a cheat by supporting websites like these.”You’ve got it backwards. It is the shonky third parties who are supporting Skyscanner with their advertising dollars. Skyscanner can be used to find good flight routes, but obviously one should still book directly or at the very least do a modicum of research into the paid advert to whom you are handing over your money."
Hi Voyager699766 please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status and the charges made and accepted during the booking process . Regards
"The problem is not Skyscanner and it's results, it's the people using the search engine in order to book solely by price without doing any research into the companies behind those adverts."
I disagree with you. Skyscanner is a consumer research and tool and like any other business they should ensure that their product (recommendations and information) is current and correct.A price that is not actually bookable should not be listed on the site and if it comes to Skycanner's attention that there are unethical and fraudulent companies listing unobtainable fares they should weed them out.From the responses I got from Skyscanner they are actually trying to do this in order to ensure that they stay relevant.
What a load of rubbish. SkyScanner purely show the prices that the ticket floggers list. How could they verify if those prices are real or not for every one of at least 50 or so ticket floggers with millions of flights around the world every day. SkyScanner is a commercial website paid for by the advertisers and provided free to use to find flights. Does your local newspaper verify that all of its advertisers are fair dinkum? Not likely.
"Skyscanner May give you lip service about weeding out the “bad ones,” but that would destroy their whole (very profitable) business. Skyscanner clearly disavows any responsibility for the companies who pay to advertise on their site. The thing with these shoddy third party middlemen is that they sometimes do deliver and some people enjoy using them. It’s a big risk, but if you will be traveling carry-on only with an uncomplicated itinerary and don’t make any changes to the booking then you could be ok. For people who like to gamble, I don’t think it’s fair that we hinder their right to do so. Everyone else should research anyone they hand over hundreds/thousands of dollars to."
"Skyscanner is a consumer research tool in the same way laid ads in yiur local newspaper are or google is. You can choose not to believe that and expect skyscanner to protect yku and due yiur due diligence for you or you can protect yourself.Air fare prices are dynamic with frequent changes, add to this that most of the shonkies who advertise don’t have live prices, then you’re not going to get what you want using third parties. On the other hand, the airlines always have live availability and prices"
It takes forever to process the payment. Money has been taken off of the account. How long does it take to receive the ticket via email?
"Hi Aleksandra, during the following hours after the purchase the tickets are sent. If you still have not received them, please contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details in order to find out what happened and inform you about the current status of your booking. Regards"
">>>Skyscanner is a consumer research and tool and like any other business they should ensure that their product (recommendations and information) is current and correct.<<<I'm afraid you're wrong. Perhaps it should be that way, but I'm afraid that it isn't. In reality, a site like Skyscanner (or Tripadvisor itself) can't be relied upon to screen us from rubbish companies. Nor should they be expected to. It is better that we do it for ourselves.>>>From the responses I got from Skyscanner they are actually trying to do this in order to ensure that they stay relevant.<<<I very much doubt that's actually the case, sorry."
"I wish to warn everyone not to book through travelgenio anything as they are a complete scam! First they pretend to give you the best deal, take the money, and after a while you receive an e mail saying that your flight has been canceled. You are than refered to call them and the airlines, but first of all they are almost imposible to reach and fot the second if you do reach them them keep promising to help you and give you options, but after a while you see it`s a scam because they don`t respond and keep hanging up the calls (which are by the way expensice if you are making international call). I ended up with no refond for the paid ticked, also lost my option for refunding the money fpr paid hotel and very dissapointed in travel genio. They advertise as they will give you the best deal, but believe me it`t better to pay expensive ticket elsewhere , because travelgenio is a total scam and you will end up with no refund, and not going on a trip....."

"Leonida, for all that I wouldn't use this company even with someone else's money, they are not a scam. What you have experienced is simply very poor service which is unsurprising since almost all third party booking sites don't invest in back office functions, staff or equipment wise.Did you get your card provider to help you get your money back?"
"Leonida. You might have noticed that your warning is just one of many hundreds on this thread alone.....yet you took no notice of any of them!Please explain to me why you think your warning will be of any use to anyone who just wants a cheap air fare and like you, does no research at all.Thank you very much.Just to let you know that you have the usual standard reply posted by the Travelgenio bot, so don't expect to get anywhere."
Why is my ticket taking too long to be issued? I want my money back!!!!
Hi Mahtab F. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your cooperation.
"Hi We were also scammed this year with Travelgenio, we paid for two tickets from Shanghai to Hong Kong in Jan this year for May, when we got to the airport, our tickets were cancelled, they said we didn't pay for them this of course this was not true, I emailed them proof of payment back in Jan and still can't get a refund out of them, we had to buy two more tickets in Shanghai with were double he cost $1200AUDDon't use them."

"Hi all,I just wanted to add and share on this topic...In early May I jumped onto Skyscanner and found great priced, irresistible flights to my bucket list destination Thailand. Before I knew it I had whipped out my card, booked and paid... The next day I received an odd looking email from Travelgino advising me that 1 of my flights had changed and to contact them promptly. I called them and they said they had not emailed me and that my flights were all booked as shown the nite before. The call ended but I felt very uneasy about it all.So I decided to do a little research on Travelgino and jumped on here to see what was on Tripadvisor all of the reviews were terrible! The alarm bells and panic set in and were louder than ever now! Had I just thrown $1100 away?! Following reading the reviews I called my bank and cancelled my card as some of the reviews said that Travelgino had changed flights and taken extra funds at the same time. I also asked my bank if they could cancel the transaction but they said they couldn't and that I would need to seek a refund from the company I purchased from.Following that my next call was to the the airlines directly. I called AirNZ they confirmed I was all booked and even had 2 seats under my name on the domestic flight. I called Cathay Pacific and they confirmed I was all booked as confirmed with my itinerary email from Travelgino and finally a call to Qantas which also confirmed I was booked. So I went from panic to relief and was pleasantly surprised after the sense of dread I had felt earlier!I am now back home I arrived back on the 3rd of June and would like to let you all know that apart from the lack of leg room in economy it all went great! The flights were all correct with enough time to get from one transfer to another... Happy travels to you allVickyEdited: 1 year ago "
"Vicky - I wouldn't place much stock in the ""reviews"" on TA for OTAs. Most are questionable - lots of trolling or written by people who don't know how to protect themselves in an online transaction.Travelgenio does not cancel flights nor do they charge your credit card for more than what you authorized.Read the terms and conditions, be very careful inputting data (dates, spelling), take screen shots of what you are you are buying. If you do not get a PNR number within a few hours of placing your order contact your credit card company and revoke your authorization of the transaction. If taking all these precautions is not your thing, buy direct from the airline."
Craig. Have you every booked flights via Travelgenio or would you ever book via them?
"Hi Vicky, Many thanks for your comment. We keep at your disposal if needed. Regards"
"@travellerYes, I booked with them for a YYZ-BKK flight earlier this year (I fly that route regularly to visit my gf) Had no issues, received the PNR shortly after booking and was able to confirm the flight on the airlines website right away. I've also booked with several other OTAs with no problem.If someone like yourself (with a legitimate TA profile) posted a negative review I would likely heed their advice, but there isn't a single such ""review"" on this thread."
I just booked through Travelgenio for a return trip Sydney - Perth and was debited the amount. I was advised an email would follow shortly and then another confirmation email would follow with e-ticket. I never received any emails or confirmations. I contacted the company and requested the above and still they did not respond to me. The booking has gone through and I contacted the relevant airlines to check all the details. This is still not an acceptable procedure from a Travel Agent.
"Hi, we Will check The confirmation status. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Anmo I, one they’re not a travel agent, they’re a ticket flogger and a terrible one at that. How much did you save compared to booking with the airline? I e booked with all Australian carriers multiple times (except Tigerair) and they are all easy to deal with and you get your booking confirmation immediately. If anything happens after that, you del directly with the airline..Keep checking your booking on the airline’s site as you cannot depend on this shonky company to be bothered to inform you of a cancellation or reschedule."
I was conned by this company about 3months ago.The person is sandeep acting as if he works for Skyscanner..Very bad.over £650 was lost.

"Booked a flight in early March with travelgenio via Skyscanner. Flight got cancelled due to grounding of aircraft, a refund was available so I requested that. I was told it can take between 15-90 days. It is now well over the 90 days. I have been in contact through email and telephone. The customer service is shocking and very unprofessional! I’ve have been sent the same email numerous times that they just seem to copy and paste ‘it can take up to 15-90 days’ for a refund. After numours phone calls and emails, I was told last week the refund has been accepted and will be in my bank account within a week. Fast forward a week and still no refund. Rang them, told me that this now wasn’t the case that the airline still have not accepted the refund. This company is nothing but liars and will never ever book with them again. I will be sure to post this on every social media site to let people know of their appalling service. And lastly I will be letting the CEO Mariano Pelizzari know how his staff is dealing with this.Edited: 1 year ago "
The customer service is not shocking. This thread alone goes back three years and is filled with hundreds of complaints about the shoddy customer service. What would be shocking is if you had received good customer service. Travelgenio is not a travel agent. They are a ticket flogger. They are not equipped to handle problems when things go wrong. This is one of the many reasons why it is a huge gamble to book with them. The time to research the reputation of a company is before booking and not after. What good is posting all over social media when you didn’t bother to read the years worth of complaints before you? Travelgenio depends on people who click click buy without researching to make money.
>> the airline still have not accepted the refund <<which airline?
"Hi Lisa123, please note that refunds depend on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your refund status and the approximately management time they provide us. Regards"
"""I will be letting the CEO Mariano Pelizzari know how his staff is dealing with this.""Make sure you name the staff so he gives them all a pay rise for doing what they have been told to do."

"Over the last 3 weeks, I have tried no less than 7 times trying to book domestic flight within Malaysia via Travelgenio as during those times, they showed the lowest price. The first couple of times when I tried to complete the booking, it said flights were no longer available. Nevertheless, I thought maybe I should monitor and track future deals and book at the earliest possibility. No matter how early I tried, none succeeded as they always ended up indicating flights being no longer available and more expensive ones were recommended instead. I think the whole mechanics was a marketing gimmick."
"they don't have live prices, they show a low fare to attract those searching by price and not pay any heed who they are dealing with or how they work. They advertise a fare, you make a booking request to say 'try buy me that ticket at that fare' in your case they cannot.If you want to see the live fare from the outset, you will find these on the airline website...many shonky third party ticket floggers don't have live pricing so operate in the same way."
"Carol is right. You will never get the fare you saw. They hope that, rather than start again you will simply buy a flight from them at whatever price the airline is asking. It's not just Travelgenio that do this."
"Hi Philip, if you need support on your booking, please send us all the details regarding the prices and flights and the extra options, dates, etc. and we will help you. Our mail is customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"@rojblake and carolThey have LIVE PRICING. I doubt either of you have ever even gone to the Travelgenio website let alone have any first hand experience with them. Yes possibly the Skyscanner results may be from cache, but then if you proceed to the Travelgenio website the results are verified (or not) on a live basis. It's also possible that in the time it takes to process your payment, the fare you have requested sells out, but that is unlikely.Travelgenio is with Amadeus, so when you are using their website you are literally accessing the airlines reservation system on a real time basis.Your trolling of these OTA threads is getting tiresome."
">>Travelgenio is with Amadeus, so when you are using their website you are literally accessing the airlines reservation system on a real time basis.<<Nonsense. There are just too many posts about Travelgenio advertising prices that turn out to be unavailable. It is a shonky ticket flogger with useless customer support, and it should be avoided."

They operate a Global Distribution System (GDS) which can be used by travel agents and by on line booking companies to purchase airline tickets by interfacing to airline systems, and they also provide reservation systems used in house by some airlines. It's entirely possible to use the Amadeus GDS without having a website at all, let alone for it to be live to the public, and after all any bricks and mortar travel agent will do exactly that for walk-in or phone-in customersSo sorry, having 'booking by Amadeus' on an e-ticket means no more than.that someone, at some stage in the booking process, connected to either the Amadeus GDS or an airline in-house system provided for them by Amadeus."

Do you even know what Amadeus is?<<Well, I run a web site, and I could easily put ""Amadeus, IATA, Visa, Mastercard"" at the bottom of each page. Complete with their logos. And yes, I know what Amadeus is.There are just too many complaints about Trevelgenio for it to have any credibility for me."
"Agree Andy.Even if they do have live booking at point of booking, it doesn’t follow that they have live feeds on their adverts or results being displayed on the likes of Skyscanner I’ve no intention of ever using them to test this out.I’m not convinced all one time posters are trolls. Even if they are, the ridiculous responses by their bot tells me all I need to know about this outfit"
@andySo I booked and paid for a flight on the TG website that clearly states they are with Amadeus and an hour later I go to the AirChina website where I can view the e-ticket that clearly says issued by Amadeus. Fairly rock solid proof IMHO.
"Sorry, but how does that prove (a) that a Travelgenio employee didn't log on to Amadeus GDS and make the booking for you rather than the whole thing being real time or (b) that Air China's reservation system isn't using the Amadeus airline product.?Case (a) isn't inconsistent with displaying an Amadeus logo at all - they do use Amadeus GDS, but they don't actually claim to be using it in real time on line. They also display an IATA logo - but they aren't an airline of course - it means that they are a member of the IATA settlement plan for booking agents, making one payment to IATA for tickets sold on behalf of IATA airlines in each accounting period instead of lots of separate payments to separate airlines.Edited: 1 year ago "
I have booked Personalised Services from Travelgenio for my Flight from Singapore to Mumbai in Air India Flight for extra baggages.Air India says they never received the payment of 31 SGD .I feel Travelgenio should refund my money or allow me extra baggage's which they took as personalised services
"Hi Namrata, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will inform you about the service pack conditions. Regards"
"Yesterday I bought two tickets, got an email confirmation that my reservation is CONFIRMED and now I got an email that they ask me to pay additional fee 50EUR because of change of ticket's prices, otherwise they will cancel my reservation. Definitely NOT RECCOMEND!"
"Hi Mellanie, of course we can help you with your booking doubts and its confirmation. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Mellanie, you did not receive an email that your booking was confirmed but rather that your booking REQUEST was confirmed. You do not make a booking on Travelgenio, but a booking request. They do not have live prices advertised on their site. They attempt to fulfill your request-sometimes they can and sometimes they can’t- and in your case the actual price was more. Want live prices? Book directly with the airline. But also actually read the terms and conditions to find out what you’re actually purchasing before booking anywhere."
"@Ben Seriously you believe ""mellanie"" really exists? Supposedly has an isssue with TG and immediately joins Tripadvisor to share her story? Same as Namrata. These are trolls, most likely from China.And Travelgenio does have live prices."
Craig seems to know a lot about Travelgenio. I wonder whether he works for them.
"Craig, seriously? I'm 100% real person, I'm just mad cause I thought that everything's confirmed - for sure, my fault that I didn't carefully read everything before booking, but still, it's quite strange that after 8 hours they want additional 50 euro from me. And yes, I register just only to wrote those comments, cause after reading all of this opinion about travel2be I wanted to add something from me"
Craig defends Travelgenio a lot! Enough said I think!
The only troll in this thread is Craig.
"I think it's only fair to point out that Craig has also posted on a Cheapoair thread this month.However, I don't agree with most of what they post."
Too late when I read this help. Totally ripped off. Service is too bad. I had a situation of airline closure and airline directed me to get refund from credit cards. I did but this Travelgenio is trying to claim it back though they might have already received the commission. Never ever again via Travelgenio
"they really seem to be scammers, totally agreed. When its come to money they have no service for refund. Nevr ever again Travelgenio"
">>>Too late when I read this help.<<<Yes, I'm afraid the time to check companies out is before you hand over your payment details rather than afterwards."
"Hi Pemmal Silva, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will check everything and inform you. Regards"
"Indeed, Travelgenio is the worst booking site. I am a very frequent flyer, but will never use Travelgenio again. I booked two different flights through them with Air Serbia last night, just before midnight. When booking, the website stated that 1 checked bag is included in the price. However, as I had booked the flights I received emails from Air Serbia notifying me that the tickets only included hand baggage. I therefore proceeded to contact Travelgenio customer support to cancel my bookings, as with 4 euros more I could get tickets with checked baggage directly from the airline (buying additional baggage to the 66€ ticket would cost 50€). However, regardless of the 24 hour cancellation policy with full refund, I have just been told that they cannot do a refund because I called the next day, (within 24 hours) and not within the 2 minutes that I had left of yesterday, when making the booking. So, firstly I was sold something I did not get, and then even within 24 hours, I was not getting the right to cancel my bookings. Will take this forward with the consumer authority."
"And also to add to my previous post, I in fact even sent them an email with my cancellation request right after getting the emails from Air Serbia, which was at 00.05 Finnish time."
"""I am a very frequent flyer"" => If that is the case, why do you not check out with whom you are booking what before handing over the caseh.""When booking, the website stated that 1 checked bag is included in the price."" => If you had a print-out, you would have had a least a minimal chance. But as you decided to cancel, this is gone as well.""I therefore proceeded to contact Travelgenio customer support to cancel my bookings"" => Correct would have been to insist to get a bag, as stated.""as with 4 euros more I could get tickets with checked baggage directly from the airline"" => Let me understand. To save 4 Euro you decided to have a middle man with all the potential issues involved? And you claim to be a frequent flyer. Even a short phone call will cost you more than 4 Euros if you calculate your money as something valuable.""Will take this forward with the consumer authority."" Of which country?The next time, please book directly with the airline. It is worth much more than a difference of 4 Euros. Much more."
"Hi Elli, of course we can help you with the luggage information. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
My case similar and I contacted you thousand time but no use. It’s been more than 3months my flight is cancelled but no refund yet.
"Hi Alan, of course we can help you with your booking refund. Please note that refunds depend on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your refund status and the approximately management time it will take. Regards"
"Travelgenio.If a REAL HUMAN is reading this then let me help you with your reply.....You need to change it so that it says...….."" we will see your refund status and let you know the APPROXIMATE time it will take to MANAGE it"".Maybe if you have a properly worded response, it will make Travelgenio seem just a little less ridiculous! You're most welcome!!!"
Never book with Travel Genio. My flight was cancelled and got no help or refund!!
">> got no help or refund!! <<if the airline cancelled their flight, they will refund the payment to your 'agent' on request. Have you checked with the airline that they have issued a refund? what has your bank said about refunding for goods not received?many third parties are ticket sellers not travel agents. Majority have very poor service once they have your money (hence all the warnings to avoid them and book directly with the airline)"
"Hi Froukje, refunds depend on airlines and their authorisation and manage times. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"These guys are useless with some robots working as customer service. They always say the same bulls**ts. useless people. They are predators waiting to hunt naive or uncareful people. AVOID IT, WARN PEOPLE, DON'T LET ANYONE BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM"
"There are loads of warnings about them, samet, but people still use them. I truly wish it were not so."
THE WORST BOOKING SITE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED! I have booked on many 3rd party sites and have never had problems like this. I booked a direct flight and am now on a flight with connections through a country where I do not have the visa or documents to travel through. I have contacted the airlines with 3 emails (now 4th) and have not heard anything back regarding the status of my ticket or my demand to be on a direct flight. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS COMPANY. Why won't someone contact me???? Ridiculous.
"Hi Emilie, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Carrying the necessary docs for travelling is passenger responsability. During the booking process all the info regarding stopovers or scales is shown. If airline made any further changes to the itinerary we will check it and inform you. Regards"
"Emilie, I’m a bit confused by what actually happened. When you submitted your booking request to travelgenio what was the airline/flight number/route you requested? It sounds like you accepted a flight with layovers and it would be your responsibility to have the correct documentation. You say you have emailed the airlines three times? Why are you doing that? You are not their customer; you appointed Travelgenio to be your agent and now you must deal with them."
"On April, 28, I booked a flight home to Toronto (QYFC47) from Frankfurt for June 28. I have used Travelgenio in the past and booked this flight the exact same way I booked all of my flights. I paid, I received a confirmation email that looked like all other emails I received in the past after booking. I didn't think of it again until the day came to fly. I got to the airport and was told I was not booked on the flight. I had no ticket. Nothing. I had a family event so waiting to take another flight was no option. I paid 1,790 EUR on that day. $2,500. This was an EXTREMELY devastating experience and has completely changed the budgeting for my trip, and the months that will follow. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Furious. Also an understatement. I work internationally and frequently use(d) Travelgenio for my bookings. This was the last time. I also work with hundreds of people who travel and, upon my return to Frankfurt, I will be telling them of this awful experience with your company. Rest assured, you WILL lose customers for this.I expect some sort of reimbursement or compensation for your company's mistake. I am happy to seek legal advice from my uncle if needed. I do hope your company takes this seriously, as I would hate for someone else to feel the shock and frustration I felt on the morning of my flight ...where all I wanted to do was go home."
"Hi Bea, you will receive a reply by mail during next hours. Regards"
"'Why won't someone contact me?' Since you asked to use an agent the airline won't contact you because you're not their customer, the agent (in this case rotten Travelgenio) is. 'have not heard anything back regarding the status of my ticket or my demand to be on a direct flight' The ticket is the one that for some reason you agreed to buy from Travelgenio. Asking / demanding to be put on a direct flight will mean making a new booking - are you willing to lose the cost of the ticket you asked Travelgenio to buy for you for what may be a more expensive new ticket?This 'I didn't think of it again until the day came to fly.' doesn't really go along with this 'I work internationally and frequently use(d) Travelgenio for my bookings.' as frequent travellers usually avoid ticket flogging third party sites. Not having checked the status of the booking at the airline's website was your responsibliity; if your credit card hadn't been charged for the booking did you not wonder about that as well.'Rest assured, you WILL lose customers for this.' If only this were the case.'I expect some sort of reimbursement or compensation for your company's mistake.' This isn't going to happen, especially as you seem to have ignored the booking after asking Travelgenio to make it.'I am happy to seek legal advice from my uncle if needed.' At a guess, Uncle Larry H Lawyer Junior will suggest you stop using awful third party sites and to keep an eye on your purchase long before the day of travel."
https:/…www.travelgenio.comBooked a flight with them for what equals $350. They withdraw $40 from my credit card and give me nothing. No ticket no refund. Can't even review them on skyscanner
Someone should keep a count of the one time poster coming here on this forum. Or create a scam/ripoff subforum.

"I booked with Travelgenio from Dubai to the UK. However, my passport didn't arrive on time so I have to cancel with them. The were quick to reply through email and they cancelled my booking with certain charges which is fair for me. I was advised that the refund processing time depends on the airlines. I tried calling Travelgenio and they said it may take 1-3months to process. I googled Travelgenio and I've read bad reviews which made me worried. I also googled Emirates Airlines refund processing times and it said around 20 working days. I kept my cool and tried contacting the agency after a week. To my surprise, I didn't even notice... the refund has already been processed as advised in the reply email. It's all back to my card in 6 working days only from the date of cancellation. All those worries were for nothing. I mean, sometimes you have to give people the benefit of the doubt. They may have bad reviews from some other people, I'm sure they also have good reviews too. Every transaction is unique. We just tend to focus more on the negative side. I'm just impressed and I can't believe I'm saying this, I recommend them. Email support is better than their voice support though (in my opinion)."
"Hi Zen, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"As a frequent flyer I have enough hassles dealing with airlines directly such as when flight times are changed or cancelled and the airline did not inform me but I regularly check the airline's manage my booking site.In the past 2 days I have had to cancel flights with BA because new flight times were inconvenient and received a full refund within 3 days and with Croatia Airlines, who I purchased cheap restricted tickets, but received a refund of the taxes. Yesterday, for another booking, I was on hold for over 60 minutes with BA to sort out new flights due to cancellations.Now while it was time consuming and a bit of a hassle contacting the airlines EVERYTHING was resolved satisfactorily because I dealt directly with the airlines involved.Travelgenio may have many happy customers who take their flights without any drama, but what happens when things go wrong?I prefer to be dealing with airlines directly than having to speak to Travelgenio, Edreams, Kiwi et al. And if I do use an agent, I use a reputable one such as American Express Travel who I booked with as opposed to the airline directly because American Express Travel was £200 less for the business class seats I wanted."
"The bot has excelled itself once again. Zen seems to be satisfied customer who got a refund in a remarkably quick period of time, but the bot thinks they are complaining!"
"We always knew that nobody human actually reads the posts!!! This proves it once and for all. Having said that.....do I believe Zen's first post on TA? He says he is impressed with Travelgenio? You would think the bot would have picked up on that but it is so used to complaints, it just uses the tried and tested response button!!!Hilarious!Edited: 1 year ago "

Yay! The bot has arrived!
WowWowThere almost 1000 complaints about this company. I wish I would’ve seen this before I booked through them. I had to cancel a flight however according to airline policy I should have a credit to use. This dishonest company attempted to prevent me from re-booking using that credit. However the airline was very honest and directly requested that I be refunded. Now somehow travelgenio claims it will take 1 to 3 months to respond to the refund request. This company is the worst stay far away!
"Hi Hugh F, Please note that refunds depend on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see if they have approved it and the time it will take for them to process it. Also take into account that, as a third party, we follow ticket and airline rules and restrictions accepted during the purchase. Regards"
"Do not buy to travelgenio!!!we bought a flight ticket and travel insurance package with travelgenio, we got the confirmation by email for the flight and insurance, for some reason they only charged the travel insurance, the day of the flight we were in the airport doing the check-in and surprisingly in the airport they told us that this reservation was canceled, it looks like travel genio does not charge us the flight so they cancel the reservation and we do not receive any cancellation notification!! so we missed the flight and we have to buy another flight at the last minute !! don't buy with travel genio!!"
"So once you realised you’d only been charged for the insurance, what did you do then?"
"Hi webwebweb, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Without being able to process the purchase and amount, there is no way to book the flights and confirm them with airline. We will check all the available info and contact you back. Regards"
I requested a refund from Travelgenio on the 20th of May i promised i would get my refund in 30 days now its 60 days gone now they have said its 90 days I need this money for my next flight Iam not happy with the service they have provided me so be careful when you go with TRAVELGENIO !

"Don't hold your breath. You'll probably never get the refund... I've been waiting five months for mine! And I didn't even cancel my flight, the airline did! I don't understand how it's possible for an airline to cancel a flight and then the travel agency/airline not refund the passengers... Terrible experience"
Which airline? have they confirmed when they issued a refund?booking / refund process direct with airlinebook flight > money to airline > airline cancels flight > airline issues refund to customer ...easybooking / refund process utilising third partyrequest flight > money to third party > third party books with airline > money to airline > airline cancels flight > airline issues refund to third party / third party chases refund > refund received by third party > third party deduct fees and refund remainder to customerEverything is going to take longer when you have a middleman in the process (even if you had picked a good one)
"With the likes of Travelgenio, the sequence could well be request flight > money to third party > third party books with airline > money to airline > airline cancels flight > airline issues refund to third party > third party forgets about refund > customer chases up third party, customer eventually chases up airline > airline confirms that refund has been issued > customer continues to pester third party > eventually customer gets money."
Exactly I have the same problem. I always trusting skyscanner for any recommendation in the past. Now I was deceived by Travelgenio!
"John K,Skyscanner doesn’t make recommendations. It just lists and displays all kinds of random bookers who pay to be displayed. Why do you think it’s a recommendation?"
"Hi John, you can find the service pack conditions in our General Terms and conditions. Moreover, if you need us to inform you about them, just send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will be pleased to send you all the details you on how to use it. Regards"
"I just booked a flight through Travelgenio via Skyscanner. My only issue thus far is the false advertisement of their service package. It is written as if to suggest that by paying the fee you are allowed to choose your seats on the flight, make dietary requests, get airport assistance, etc. However what you are really paying for is for a person to book these services on your behalf, but you still have to pay whatever fee the airline decides to charge for the seats you choose. Something to note is I am only trying to book standard economy seats, nothing fancy at all. This is complete false advertising and is total WASTE of over $40 (I booked 2 tickets). Of course upon calling and explaining my understanding of the service pack and me telling them I don't need because it won't help me they are sticking to this being non-refundable so I'm just out of $40. BEWARE of the service pack."
"Hi zakiyaali06, if you need us to clarify the terms and conditions of the service, they are shown in our General Conditions and also our agents in customer.service@travelgenio.com will be pleased to explain the way to use it. We keep at your disposal. Regards"
"#995In this case I don’t think it is “complete false advertising” but that you have misunderstood what was offered, selected by you and bought by you.This particular option (of which in the booking flow on Travelgenio you will be offered many add-on options) is basically a fee for them to do extra work on your behalf. The information against this optional extra seems fairly clear, at least to me. The cost excludes any extra costs that the airline will want for the extra service (e.g. seat assignments). “Personalised ServiceIf you need any kind of special service, this is exactly the service you need. Our agents will handle your service request with the airline. Please bear in mind that the confirmation of the request depends at all times on the airline and that extra costs might apply (in such case you will be informed before confirming the service). ”"
I have been trying all night to get my e ticket after having booked it . i have written several times to customer service. None seem to respond. I have this really bad feeling of being scammed. And really dont know what to do. Can u please send me my eticket...immediately?
"""Can u please send me my eticket...immediately?""This is the Air Travel forum on TripAdvisor - we are all just regular members like you, and none of us has access to your booking or e-Ticket info. You'll just have to chase TravelGenio to get it.-JimG"
You did NOT book a ticket. You sent a request to Travelgenio to buy a ticket for you.
"Hi Travel Guide, please send us in a private message your booking code or mail and we will check the booking status and contact you back asap. Regards"
I have booked through Travelgenio for many times already and their price is 30-50% cheaper. I have no idea how they manage to get that cheap and they are legit. Just be careful before purchasing because sometimes the price will be different from Skyscanner website.
"Hi Zahar, thanks for your comment. We hope to see you once more soon in our site. Regards"
Nobody can possibly sell 50% cheaper than the airline's web site. Anyone doing that would sell at a big loss and go broke. I think the human at Travelgenio must be having a slow day.
Zahar's first forum post and they are praising Travelgenio!Not suspicious at all!!!!!
Hello it's mohammad hajj hassan... It was a very bad experience i have tried ever in reserving tickets... I have booked a return flight to someone i know and the price was shown 439$ and when i was retrieve to your site you put the price in myr so i haven't though that you lie in showing price and this falt should be also the cheapflights site not only you because they let you into their comparative sites list...anyway it's not only the problrm.. You put that the baggage are not allowed eventhough you have listed while reserving that it was allowed to have 45 kg in baggage on Ethiopian airlines!!! You sent everything via mail and it's clear.. There are 3 hours that i have booked the flight and completed the paiment and i am still waiting to have the E-ticket eventhough i have contacted your cust service.. Bad service.. Scammers!!
"Hi Hajj H, of course we can help you with the luggage information. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
"Price seems to be good but Customer service is way below expectation. I booked a Luxair flight via Travelgenio. The flight itself got cancelled by Luxair and I received a confirmation from Luxair that the price for the tickets was refunded. They refunded the money back to Travelgenio. I am chasing this now since two months, having raised already multiple service tickets for this without even a response from Travelgenio. Very disappointing, I am now considering legal actions."

"My husband bought a ticket through Travelgenio to fly to Moscow via Aeroflot airlines for April 11th, booking reference J254I13. We have cancelled the ticket since my husband got sick and could not fly having a medical certificate indicating the reason for cancellation of the ticket. From April until now we are in constant communication with Travelgenio, who refuse a refund stating that Aeroflot did not authorize the refund. We contacted Aeroflot and opened a claim with them. After a month, we got a correspondence from the Aeroflot that a refund was sent to Travelgenio's bank account. However, this Travel Agency is refusing to refund the money for unused ticket. They put us on hold for hours at a time, pretend that they don't speak English, and promise to send the money ""in two days"".This is the worst company to deal with.PLEASE, DON'[T BUY TICKETS FROM THEM!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!We are still fighting with them to get our refund. They don't want to talk to us. If, by chance, we are able to reach them and talk to somebody, they promise to send the refund ""in 48 hours"", but five months have passed, and we still did not get the refund!!This a fraud company - don't deal with them!!!"
Did you have travel insurance? That is the route you should look at for a ticket cancelled due to illness.
"Rita, You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your cooperation."
"I have had the worst experience with TravelGenio. 1 star is an over-reach for their service. I have booked a ticket with them departing from Nice - Bucharest, for which I paid an amount of 113 euro. The confirmation came via 2 emails, where in both of the emails the reservation was deemed confirmed and the money were, of course, automatically withdrawn from my account. Yesterday I tried to check into my flight - but adding my booking confirmation, it appeared that the confirmation number belonged to a trip for March 2020 to Madrid (In my confirmation email, all details were correct in terms of departure and arrival country and so on). I found it weird, but then again, I thought it was some sort of error. Arriving at the airport check in desk, the lady from the counter was not able to find my reservation. Upon further inquiries, apparently the booking was confirmed with travelgenio from my side, but travelgenio did not do the needful with the airline company - thus, no ticket for me. What was recommended by the airline was to book a last minute ticket of 259 euro - since we had almost 15 minutes until flight time and I had no other choice than to pay the amount, expecting to solve the issue with Travelgenio directly later on. Big mistake. I called travelgenio, and the ladies from the customer care team rudely put the blame on me: apparently the time of the flight has changed with 30 minutes, and I have received an email from them (I DO NOT have anything in my mail box and they DID have the right email address, because I received 2 emails from them with the confirmation number. I have also checked my spam - nothing there) where I should have confirmed the 30 minutes time change - and because I did not do that, they have cancelled my ticket WITH NO WARNING and of course, kept the money. Also, they deny to refund me the 259 euro that I paid for the last minute ticket, saying that the blame is on me, and not them.They said that they issue 1000 tickets per day - unnecessary detail. I do not care how busy you are, I have paid for a ticket and I expect to be able to consume the ticket - and they cannot call everyone when something changes. Again, I received no email about this, and I asked the lady from the agency to send me this email they sent me earlier this month, and I have received no email as such. This is utterly repulsive and I am amazed how they are treating the customers."
"Hi Alexandra, Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking information and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Alexandra, I doubt you'd have been amazed at their behaviour had you checked this mob out first. I daresay you'd have run away from them as fast as you could.Even if you book with the airlines directly, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your bookings. It's much better to be aware of potential problems and to sort them out before leaving home. Never rely on fixing an issue at the airport.I expect you to get the money you paid for the original tickets back, but not the money for the last minute flights you bought."
"Why oh why won't customers who have received a helpful reply from the Travelgenio bot, update us with the successful (or otherwise) resolution to their issues? I would be interested to know."
Perhaps they are told not to? I don't know. I agree it would be helpful if people did return.
"Hello Travelgenio, I am still waiting for my refund as it has been more than 15 days since the request was submitted, you have not replied to the email I sent you."
"Hi _global-083, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com or a private message with the booking info and we will check the current status of the refund and if airline has authorised and processed it. Regards"
"I have already sent you an e-mail, the airline has confirmed that they have processed the refund and the money is in your account."
"Just posting an update on this, Travelgenio have indeed refunded me 85% of the ticket price + like a tenner in service fees, as per the cancellation protection plus insurance agreement :), I noticed people often don't post outcomes of disputes on here so hope this helps"
Thanks for your comment. Regards
"Booked flight on March 06 2019 for flight from Belgrade Serbia to Toronto Canada on Sept. 13 2019 via SkyScanner --> Travel Agent Travelgenio (Spain) with JET Air. In May 2019 JET Air claimed bankruptcy. Since flight is booked with Travelgenio Jet Air will not refund ticket fee since their Refund policy is only for direct (on Jet Air site) booking. 3 requests were placed with Travelgenio for ticket refund (May 25, June 01 and June 15) with no reply from this Agency. Also phone calls (3x) ended up being hang up on. Where to take this next? Definitely Travelgenio is not on my favorite Travel Agent list."
You gave your money to TG. TG gave it to Jet Airways. Jet Airways went broke. Your money is gone. How would you expect TG to refund you?
"Hi Vuletic G, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will inform you about the Jet Airways refund process. Regards"
"booked a flight from London to New York. it didn't go through but I was charged. instead of getting a refund as no booking, got an email stating that they need couple of hundred extra to book another flight. didn't agree still no refund in-spite of many calls and email (ticket no: 2730425). all in vain. pathetic"

Worst service and Fake company. I was told to get refund 3 months ago and I still haven't received it. When I called the customer service only thing they keep telling is airline hasn't approved it and our supervisor is taking a look at it. Confirmed with airline already that they have approved my refund of $1760.59 but travelgenio just keeps telling that they haven't received it. Worst service of all. NEVER BOOK FROM TRAVELGENIO

Hi kp619143. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
@ kp619143 Over 1000 posts on this thread and you still booked with travelgenio? Artificial Intelligence meets genuine stupidity is a deadly combo.
Travelgenio is the worst agent I ever used. They ignore any ticket you tried to contact. They push you to discuss with the airline company directly and did nothing to help when the flight changed or you need help. They use expensive phone support to earn your money. I will never use this agent again.
"Hi Ldong, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"I will send an email to you but this is an email address which I never saw on your website. Are you sure it works for me? I submitted more than 3 tickets via the contact form of your website before and never get a response. I called you and you asked me to contact the British Airway directly without any help to me, waste of my time and extra fee for your 'customer service' phone number.Could you please tell me why?"

"I bought tickets on Monday bank holiday with a debit card. I was extra charged 5% for using a credit card. After payments tickets were not issued. I raised a ticket and I was contacted yesterday with the request of the scan/photo of the debit card and my ID/passport. I got in touch with the bank who told me under any circumstances NOT to send anything to them. They told me that monies were sent from the account and there is no need for additional checks, although I should keep on politely ask for the ticket, which was agreed on the purchase completion. When I sent them the pictures with the blurred card number and visible only 4 last digits and copy of my passport with hidden info that could be used for scams I was told that the quality does not passes their security. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM THEY ARE SCAMMERS"
"""DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM""Yes, over 1000 postings in this thread alone saying that very thing (not to mention multiple other threads here on TA that say EXACTLY THE SAME THING). What a pity you could not have done two minutes research, right here on TripAdvisor (where you have been a member for over 4 years) to learn how horrid this outfit is.Now your warning can join the the thousands of other warnings by people such as yourself who are too lazy to do any research and buy the first cheapest thing they can find.

"Hi Pawel K, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will inform you about your tickets. Regards"
Do not book with travelgenio!! I've travelled 5 to 6 six a year for the past four years and I've never come across such a disgusting lying company. When my booking was confirmed I received an email from travelgenio stating:CancellationsAdultsCancellations allowed until 20/07/2019: 100.00% of the fare's value per passenger. Cancellations allowed from 20/07/2019: 100.00% of the fare's value per passenger.Anyway my flight cost £227.95 and after calling consistently for 1 month my emails being ignored and my number was eventually blocked I received a £60 refund in travelgenios words 'as a gesture of commercial goodwill'. I'd rather pay double the fare than have to deal with agent again.
You did not have to deal with them in the first place! That was a basic mistake!
"Hi Danielle, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"

"Roj,Should that not be ""You might very well think that - I couldn't possibly comment."" Quote from the original FU."
"That would be more accurate to FU, but I wasn't sure that many others would pick up on it, so I paraphrased :-)"
"Danielle.Just so you are aware, no human at Travelgenio answers the posts on here. They use a bot and three or four automated replies.No human actually reads the posts, as is painfully clear from the dreadful replies. Why they bother.....who knows! Sorry.Edited: 1:05 pm, September 03, 2019 "
I think they would actually look better if they didn't bother replying at all.
"Travelgenio are really horrible ! Horrible !!!! Stay away from them . First I book the ticket, the transaction was ok (they took the money). Then they say the way of the transaction was not not secure (!), and I need to pay again via another portal. Then they say we also need copy of passport and credit card (all these in a couple of hours). Then they come back saying that the price of the ticket changed (!) - even though they had confirmed that the price will stay the same if I pass all the challenges within the day ! Please stay away !!"
"Hi Ada, we would like to have all the details to check them in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Please send us all the info and we will contact you asap. Regards"
Hi I just sent you all the info via email.
"For the second time I write here because I'm desperate. I bought a ticket through Travelgenio, taking a flight to Sao Paulo by the airline Aigle Azur. I received a cancelled flight email, !!!!The purchase is debited from my credit card in Travelgenio's name; not in the name of the airline. What you have to solve with them is an internal Agency-Airline problem. I don't want to keep sending emails to keep getting evasive responses. It's simple, I get the amount back to or i get on another flight!! I am in a dangerous situation of VISIA and I must leave France. I can't wait. I'm waiting for a solution. I've been working in tourism for many years. I know how this works. NataliaEdited: 3:57 pm, September 12, 2019 "
"Hi Natalia,If you were flying with Aigle Azur, then your flight wasn't just cancelled. Unfortunately the airline has completely closed and gone out of business. Travelgenio probably isn't going to refund you if they haven't been refunded by the airline. There is a message on the Aigle Azur site with information on what to do: https://www.aigle-azur.com/"
"Hi Natalia, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"If you paid by credit card then you might be able to get your money back that way. Perhaps you are also covered by travel insurance?As Aigle Azur has gone bust, I see no prospect of getting any money at all form Travelgenio or the airline, sorry.Company creditors are likely to get a tiny percentage of what they are owed at best if insolvency works like it does in the UK."
"Avoid this company like the plague, I booked a flight with them took cancellation insurance out with them, cancelled the flight got confirmation of this with a number no contact from the company no refund scammers a bad company to deal with zero customer service"
"Hi Mike, of course we can help you with the management of your insuranced ticket. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and the arrangement you want to make and we will tell you if it is possible and the steps to follow. Regards"
"I would add my voice to the calls to avoid this booking agent. I booked a flight with them and they charged me a completely different price to what I clicked OK on! it cost 100 GBP more than the price clearly shown at checkout. I thankfully took screenshots, but I'm currently in a never ending email chain with customer services.The faster this company goes out of business the better."
>> The faster this company goes out of business the better. <<but to do that people need to stop giving them their money. It is their customers that are keeping them in business.no customers = no business

"Dear friends from Travelgenio,my friend from Thomas Cook agency Belgium and I were sitting together and buying my ticket from Zagreb, Croatia to Brussels and back.Obviously, we chose luggage included in both flights, as you can see in the printscreens below.After a couple of minutes, we received a notification that I don't have luggage included from Zagreb to Brussels. You can also see that in the screenshots.We were confused, but angry. Until now, we always chose Travelgenio when buying tickets!Please, do make this mistake go away so we continue being your customers, also recommending you to our customers, of course, we expect at no additional cost!Please do answer asap, we really care that this is resolved soon.Best regards,Sabina Barbiš"
SabinaI suggest you contact Travelgenio on the email address given in reply #1065.Humans working for Travelgenio do not read this forum.The posts made by Travelgenio on here are by a bot.
"It's hard to decide what is the worst on this post- 1st posters who have only come on to complain about the problems they have-instead of researching first- or anyone with a few posts, who has been on, but still didn't figure it out!!1070 posts, with a heading like that, and people are still 'cheated'??!!"
"""my friend from Thomas Cook agency Belgium and I were sitting together and buying my ticket from Zagreb, Croatia to Brussels and back""So your friend works for a travel agency and buys tickets through a shonky third party? I have no words."
"Gobsmacked that someone from Thomas Cook would touch this shonky mob.Is it me, but it see,s loke we’re getting more one poster wonders whinging about this dreadful company? Are they actually getting worse and have overtaken eScreams in the charge to the bottom? The. Again they may just have reduced their prices - that would be more than enough to get throwing their money at them without doing a second of research."
"According to the thread that Sabina started, the friend from Thomas Cook thinks:""That this is unbelievable and terrible!?"""
"Hi Sabina, of course we can help you with the luggage information. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
Hard to believe Sabina's friend works for Thomas Cook?!!
I'm speechless as well. I'm nonplussed that someone already working in the travel industry thought it was a good idea to use Travelgenio. Surely this is some sort of joke?
"I'm not Roj. Most vertically agents are clueless, some even about their own packages. Suffice to say, the ""friend "" appears to be one of them."
I know someone who works for Thomas cook her ein the UK. She is very good with both holidays and flights. Maybe she is one of the few exceptions.
Possibly. If you're good why work for a company that restricts what suppliers you can use? Be an independent. There's never a day goes by I regret not working in travel any longer. One look at the biggest trade only FB group tells you all you need to know. So many can't even answer the most basic questions.
"I don't think she will be working for TC much longer, one way or another. One of the good things I find about her is that we can have long conversations about travel and she seems to have a good range of knowledge which is not just limited to flogging holidays in her day job."
"I'm pleased Roj. Good, knowledgeable agents area rarity, apart from in places like Trailfinders etc. I know a handful of good indie agents, but I know far more I'd never dream of booking through. The last time I booked via an agent was before I worked in travel, so more than 30 yrs ago. Even then I ended pointing out her mistakes.If you've got a good one then stick with her."
"I don't use her for anything (mostly because of who she works for), though I might if she does branch out on her own shortly. She is thinking about it as her own position seems a bit perilous at the moment.We help with the same local charity and chat a lot when we aren't busy with something else. We both appear to have a similar passion for travel!"
"If she's good she'll do well as an indi. I know a couple of people who set up their own home working business and they now have 3/4 high street stores. Their customer service is exemplary, so their repeat business is the core. I feel for TC employees. It's not been an easy few years for them."
"The worst agency I ever dealt with, we had an email confirmation from them that are flights were booked and double-checked everything and they had put the last name wrong. Tried to resolve in many times, mind you at first within the 24hr US calculation policy. Could not get anywhere, then tried reaching out to Tap Air no go said the agency is responsible. Long story short they wanted more money, even stopped replying once they were not going to get there way since I had the emails to prove it was there mistake. Ended up having to dispute with Charge Card Company which I one, then they even tried to threaten court action which never went anywhere. In the end, I got my money back from CC but of course 3 months later and had to pay way more for my tickets."
"The DOT 24 hour cancellation rule only applies to airlines in the US. You did not book with an airline, but a third party ticket flogger., and a bad one at that."
Hi Centauto03;We apologise for any inconvenience caused.Send us all the details to this email address: customer.service@travelgenio.com Our team will review the case and we will keep you informed.Best regards.
"centauto, you aren't the first person to erroneously believe that there is a general catch all law allowing cancellation without penalty within the first 24 hours of booking a flight. Not by a long way, and I'm absolutely certain you won;t be the last.But the truth is as Frommy says. The regulation only applies to airlines, not to dreadful ticket flogging sites, of which Travelgenio is a prime example.Tap Air were right, too. Your contract was with Travelgenio, not them, so they could not assist you.I think you've had a very good result in getting refunded by your card provider. At least you did not lose out in the end despite the frustration of dealing with this bunch. You can see just how useless they are by the replies from their bot.I reckon the lesson from this is clear. Book directly with the airline. You will have more rights, and far better service."
Yes travel genio is a rip off company that fails to do what they first advertise among other things.
Good luck with any refund from travel genio they are scammers.
"Lisa, I reckon the bot will be along shortly to assure you that of course they can help with your booking doubts all you have to do is blah blah blah...They are incredibly poor, to be sure."
Travelgenio is really a scammer. I tried to purchase the ticket but my card was denied yet my card charged with admin fee. Tried to call their customer support but the average hold time was 10 mins and ended up nobody answered the call. rip off.
"Hi Aaron, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details (mail, the fees you mentioned, etc) and we will check what you need and inform you about it. Regards"
"I agree I would advise to **AVOID BOOKING ** with these guys and go to a more reputable site. I tried to add baggage to my booking for a flight and the only option they had was an extra option which actually stated, extra luggage, seating and other things. It was $31AUD or 20Euros, the money was paid but I then had to cough up extra for my bags. Their site is not clear and when I asked what the payment was for, they simply said to have customer support for my booking. They kept telling me this is stated in the T&C's and that it is non refundable. I also read that most people complained about being charged extra on credit card. Best advice.. just avoid them all together!!!!"
"Hi Rose, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts about special services and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"My ticket was refundable and in fact I have physically visited the airline company offices in order to cancel that ticket. The airline company confirmed that the whole amount of euros 640 for one way trip from Dubai to Athens,is refunded as the airline company didn't charge anything. But you as Travelgenio, still keeping my money since last April, instead you should have kept just the 30 euros as per your admin fee and to have returned the rest. Have sent several emails to your customer service but no one bothers to reply. This is very serious!You are keeping money that don't belong to you!"
"Hi Dimitri, could you tell us your booking code? Refunds depend on airlines authorisations. If you prefer you can send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check all the procedure. Regards"
"Hi Travelgenio team. The reference code is M3EWGJ.As told before, I went personally to the airline's office and cancel the ticket the day before of the scheduled departure. You are entitled of 30 euros admin fee. All the above is stated to 6 or more emails sent to you, but didn't receive any reply or the money.Also, please note that one 21st February, I made two other bookings with Travelgenio of euros 1,300 circa. As is 6 months now since the complainant was generated, please let's conclude the issue with no further delay."
Hi Dimitri. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your cooperation.
"Dimitri-Please do let us other TA members know if Tavelgenio ever gives you any assistance.. they seem to always 'pretend"" that they will.. but do they ever? Really? Talk is cheap..."
I ran into a similar problem booking a flight on kayak. The flight advertised on Kayak was $679.00. When I went book I was taken to Travelgenio and the price was now $750.00. I went to another agency and got the same flight for $706.00
"Hi Wayne, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Wayne, how much was the flight if booked directly with the airline?"
"Travelgenio, i have checked my credit card statement of this month, and despite the 10 at this point emails that have sent to your customer service and your Trip Advisor page, you did hold a circa euros 250 fee, which you are not entitled. You are only entitled of 30 euros fee as per admin expense. For the last time, I am mentioning, that i have personally visited the Airline office at the airport the day before departure to cancel the ticket where the company assured me that the ticket was canceled with no penalty. Then, your customer service wrote that was a no show like they haven't read any of my emails. So i have visited again the Airline office but Head quaeres this time, at Emmar Square Building No 6, where again the Airline confirmed to me that they havent charge any cost as have canceled the ticket on time. I have immediately sent an email to your customers' services from the Airline office stating the same. Your customer service was replying the same answer all over again like no one was reading the content of my emails. I guess you have a machine answering. If not always, to this case at least. Thereafter when i was trying to follow up, no one replied hence I tried also to Trip Advisor page. To recap: I had paid a one way Dubai to Athens last April at the price of euros circa 650. Have canceled in time, the Airline didn't apply any cost. Is been already 5 months until you return me a portion of the amount. You need to return the money, keeping just the euros 30 admin fee. RegardsDimitri"
"Hello Lulutoo,Please note my reply just sent to Travelgenio. I believe that most of the times there was a machine answering my emails, sincere whatever I was mentioning and more specifying on each next email, I was always receiving the exact phrase for reply. When tried to call using the international tariff, no one ever answered the phone despite the several attempts. To be fair, the prices of Travelgenio are very competitive and have used in the past as well. But this time that I had to cancel so some more coordination was needed, it became a complicated story 5 months now and counting.Regards"
"Hi Dimitri, could you tell us your booking code to check the info airline provided regarding your booking? Thanks"
"Don't worry, Dmitri, they are at least consistent, since it's a bot that replies to you here as well.Have you managed to get anywhere since your last post here?"
"Hi Dimitri, without identifying here your booking we cannot ask for further details. Could you tell us your booking code to check the info airline provided? Thanks"
It's in post 1097. You claimed to have replied already.
Hilarious!The bot has got it wrong once again!
"As mentioned earlier, my booking is: M3EWGJHave exchanged other 4 emails with your customer care who again doesn't seem to know your Terms and Conditions. You are using the Turkish Airlines company in order for you to keep the USD 230, plus the Euros 30 of admin fee. For the last time, i am telling you that i have visited twice the Turkish Airlines offices, the first was to cancel the ticket and then next day to confirm that no charge or penalty was applied (which Turkish Airline have confirmed to me on my first visit anyway). You cant continue keeping money which you are not entitled too any longer."
"Hi RojBlake, Still trying to resolve. Losing too much time on this. I guess their robots prefer not to understand, very convenient for travelgenio."
"AVOID ABSOLUTELY TRAVELGENIOI write this message for all those who are preparing to book via travelgenio, STOP ALL, their practices are really dishonest. I booked a flight of 4 hours through them, then later I received an email to say that the flight was canceled (while the flight still existed) but they offered to relocate me on another flight with stopover of 12 hours in total. I replied that I did not want this alternative and they told me that they would send me an email with a new alternative. More than a month later and after more than 10 calls they offered me a new flight alternative that I accepted directly by mail and phone. And since I did not receive any news during 3 weeks and that the date of my flight was getting closer, I called them to ask them the flight tickets (of the second alternative that I have accepted) and they told me that this flight did not exist and that I should be satisfied with the first alternative so the flight of about 12 hours and that without any compensation. To summary they propose alternatives, then say that they do not exist. It’s really shameful. Not to mention the fact that you have to wait a long time (on charged call) for someone to answer the phone every time and that nobody was really able to help me anyway (and sometimes they will cut off on your nose), if you have that kind of problem you're in troubles and that's all. Many people complain about travelgenio because they are catastrophic, unfortunately personally I only saw this after booking.This company is just to AVOID and then it's always the same thing, they will comment this publication with this kind of message ""Hi, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the procedure.” Do not tire yourself, I will tell my experience with you on all forums and pages of flight comparators. RegardsI have the proof mails of all that I advance"
"Hope you get this sorted out Dimitri, but it’s not looking good.It would actually be funny how wrong the bot gets things and how it illustrates how terrible they are, when presumably they’re trying to pretend they care, if it weren’t for real people losing time and money thanks to their utter incompetence.Edited: 2:15 pm, October 07, 2019 "
"Thanks, I routinely book air tickets through skyscanner, the third parties like budget.uk, Mayflower.com.my, or gotogate are okay. Only worries for flying a real budget airline like jet airline, Scoot, AirAsia , where checked in luggages and meals are not inclusive."
Hi Dimitri. You will receive a new reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
charleBS.I'm pretty sure you are not serious about always booking with dodgy third parties.....especially Gotogate who are one of the worst out there.
i will not buy ticket from travgenio again. it's show cheap ticket in skyscanner but lier. i have to pay extra for credit or debit card and bags that not include in ticket. such a lier website. and now also cannot trust skyscanner too
"""and now also cannot trust skyscanner too""Skyscanner is just a comparison site. It takes the prices from the websites. And as long as many third parties do not have live prices but prices to attract potential customers, Skyscanner will take those prices. Plus, as Skyscanner is free to use, they need to get advertising income from suppliers.Advice: You can use Skyscanner, Google flights or the IATA Matrix to find out possible flights and get an idea about prices. Then go to the airline directly.Please be also aware that some airlines also have ""hand luggage"" or ""light"" ticket fares. So you need to check the fare rules / what is included. Most airlines will charge also for an (advance) seat reservation."
I am also having a bad experience with this company and their customer service. They repeatedly reply to complaints and reviews advising that I email their customer service email address but this seems to be futile. Content / complaints of emails & messages are not even acknowledged. Instead sent my booking details again etc.I believe they only reply to say to email their customer service to make it look like they care; but that is far from the truth.They are sneaky and deceitful.Avoid booking with them at all costs!

is it becos Skyscanner is now owned by Chinese??
becos skyscanner is now under Chinese co.
Skyscanner is just a comparison site...but it does give scores based on customer satisfaction for OTAs...strangely enough Travelgenio have 2.5/5..almost the lowest I noticed...

It's always nice to see that threads like this have helped people. Particularly when the result is avoiding this horrible company.
"#1140Good Morning Roj,Agree totally,this shonky is wonky...even I am staying away..."
"I'm sorry, but I can't think of one positive thing that I could say about Travelgenio and it's sister companies. Or Edreams, Kiwi, Justfly, Bravofly and a couple of others for that matter."
TRICKED/FOOLED/ROBBED BY TRAVELGENIOI would have never booked through Travelgenio if there wouldn'thave shown a lower price on Skyscanner and then once you bookthrough them they put an extra fee that the amount is exactly the same as from the airline.Now I have to deal with Travelgenio to get refunded after my flight was cancelled by Turkish Airlines because of bad weather.Even though they see that the flight was cancelled by the airline and havethe authorisation by Turkish Airlines they refuse to refund me.Now I have been to the Turkish Airlines office which wants to send theman e-mail so there is no reason left not to refund me.But Travelgenio has NO E-MAIL to contact them to.I called them up only for asking for an e-mail of them but instead of tellingme they hang up.I have now an agency that is specialised on problems like that which willtake actions.This is the worst experience I ever had with any travel agencyor anything similar.SOME INFORMATION ON TRAVELGENIO:First of all if you can't find a customer service phonenumber easilyno e-mail at all.When i call after 10 minutes they hang up to get anyone I need to call a few times spending an hour.The customer service is unfriendly and not helpful at all.Occasionally they just quit the phone conversation.
"Hi Chris, of course we can help you with your booking reimbursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your reimbursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
>> and the approximately management it will take. <<is this a bad translation? what does it mean?
"I believe it is bot speak, but I could be wrong, as I'm not fluent. But whatever it means the results of sending an email will probably be less than spectacular."
"This not good ,I go booking skyskanner , via Travelgenio ,Much diffrence after final position,I have not book, But from my accont cut 20 USD , why"
"Hi Wander, of course we can help you with your booking and payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Did you give them your payment details? Have you contacted your card provider?You can try Travelgenio but I wouldn't have high hopes.

"Thank you, your feedback had been helpful, as I too wanted to book Travelgenio.. Shame on you Skyscranner."
">>Shame on you Skyscranner<<Skyscanner, like most commercial web sites, is funded by advertising and does not carry out any checks on its advertisers. It does not give any guarantees about whether its links lead to reputable companies."

#1153Skyscanner asks its users to provide ratings and reviews...which it shows against the OTAs with the search results....not perfect....but as a regular twice a month user of skyscanner they tend to reflect my own booking experiences....last time I looked Travelgenio were quite low.....
"Hi Chris, refunds depend on airline authorisation and management. Once they approved it and make it effective we are able to process it. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com if you need us to check the current status. Regards"
"""I will now file a complaint to Turkish Airlines as its also there responsibility who they let sell there tickets.""They have NO control over a third party ticket flogger doing exactly what you could have done yourself direct with the airline."
i faced the same issue i dont know why skyscanner is not acting on it such a scam travelgenio and travel2Be
"The same issue as who, Guarav and what do you expect Skyscanner to do?"

"I wanted to book a ticket from Dubai to Hyderabad for my brother and skyscanner showed me a direct flight to the destination which can be booked through TRAVELGENIO.. At first the TRAVELGENIO website showed me the flight details that I wanted to book.. But as I proceeded the site showed me 3 options.. with somewhat similar fares.. So I got confused and selected one of the option and ended up booking a wrong flight.. It cost me 24,000 Indian Rupees.. and when I was trying to cancel it... I got a message showing our customer care will get back within 24 hours"
">> when I was trying to cancel it. <<you did not make a booking you made a ""booking request""the advertised price may not be available when they get round to dealing with your request although if you have already instigated a cancellation your money may be lostif it was a non-refundable ticket then you can cancel but there would be no refundThere are so many warnings about using third party sites (did you do any research?)...you really need to double and triple check all information...best to avoid them altogether and book directly with the airline"
'But as I proceeded the site showed me 3 options.. with somewhat similar fares.. So I got confused and selected one of the option and ended up booking a wrong flight'A bad tool blames his workman...
"Hello Frinto. Of course we can help you to cancel your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and whether you wish to cancel the whole booking or just a part of it and we will indicate the conditions of your fare for cancellations which, as you know, depend on the specific conditions the airline applies. Regards."
True! Do not use it! Disappointment Only brings to the table
Thank you for contacting us Vladimir. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what queries you have so we can get you an answer. Thank you.
I would not use this site as they cheat old people of their money Still waiting for refund after three months was promised refund in28 days
"Thank you for contacting us 498harshat. As you know, refund times depend on the policies of the various airlines, as they are the ones who approve and manage refunds. In any case, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference so that we can check the status of processing with the airline. Thank you."
you don't allow the booking to be made until your raise the price to sky high- how will people give you booking codes .. lol .
"Hello Sharfuddin M. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking and the amounts on which you have doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards."
"I don't think Sharfuddin made a booking at all. At least I hope not, since they described the price as being sky high!"
"I should have read posts on this site before booking flights from Iguassu Falls, BR to Rio De Janeiro, BR. I was in a rush to book the tickets. On the Skyscanner, Travelgenio was one of the cheap fares. When booking it using my credit card (like others mentioned in the posts), the fare jumped. After booking, I realized that the price was much more higher, I called the customer service line to cancel the reservation right away; I was put on hold for 10-15 minutes, then the line dropped (three times). I called again, finally I reached a representative and was told that the reservation could not be cancelled. I told her that I just booked it less than an hour ago and their fare was higher than most of the others, due to additional fees, How could they claim theirs a cheap fare site?The final fare was even higher than the fare listed on the airline site. I should have gone directly to the airline site, as I usually do.I'm not going to use Travelgenio any more and will let my family and friends know about the experience. I'm afraid that I would not use Skyscanner for searches anymore. I should just stick to Kayak."
"Kayak also has ads from shonky online agencies. Use sites like Kayak or Skyscanner to find out which airlines fly your route, but then always book direct with the airline."
"Hello Tracey. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking and the amounts on which you have doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards."
"The problem you have is not really related to the sites you use, Tracey, it's all about looking for the cheapest price. You will automatically be drawn towards whichever company has advertised the cheapest fare, which will often not be available when you make a booking request.sydneynick is right. To ensure that you are looking at live prices, only go to the airline sites."
"Tracy,“The fare was higher, than from the airline... “Yes, that is common with many ticket floggers.Best of luck, and hope that the Travelgenio ‘bot can help you.Good luck,HuntEdited: 12:47 pm, December 10, 2019 "
"Why does Skyscanner pretend not to know that TravelGenio adds a lot of money compared to the price shown, thus becoming the most expensive site compared to others? I was screwed by TravelGenio because I trusted Skyscanner. There's more to trust on Skyscanner until it shows the prices of unreliable websites"
"@MicheleSkyscanner is in a difficult situation as they offer their services for free. So they need to generate income from advertising.I do not believe that nobody at Skyscanner is aware that most third parties do not have live prices. They are not naive.Airline websites can show prices for hand luggage only. However, if you travel with luggage and want a seat reservation the ticket cost will be higher.The key to me is to treat adults as adults and offer a freedom of choice. Skyscanner is not a nanny. It is the adult who needs to understand with whom he wants to enter business with and to understand the balance of risk vs. reward.The internet is not a safe place. Neither are printed newspapers. One has to be careful before handing over a larger amount of money."
"Hello Michelle. Of course, we can help you and clarify any doubt you have about your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and indicating what doubts you have and we will explain in detail. Regards."
"+1 to what Phil said. Skyscanner is not to be trusted, nor is Tripadvisor or any other search or comparison site.It's as simple as that for me.None of them are in business to protect consumers. They are there as tools to be used by people who want information. They do not recommend anyone or endorse anything.I am sure that all such sites are well aware that shonky companies use them to advertise prices that are usually not available when push comes to shove. But what can they actually do?"

"Dubia Phil is correct in Post 1183 ""...treat adults as adults and offer a freedom of choice..... It is the adult who needs to understand with whom he wants to enter business with and to understand the balance of risk vs. reward.... One has to be careful before handing over a larger amount of money....""These days so many people expect firms to nanny them (naïve in the extreme) and refuse to accept any culpability for problems that arise directly from their failure to apply due diligence to ALL transactions they have willingly entered into. Caveat Emptor folks - the proverb is as true today as it was centuries ago"
"It seems to be a sign of the times. People are too keen to trust websites, and not just when it comes to air travel. There seems to be a lack of folks willing to do even the most minimal amounts of research, and as for checking the T&C's, well, 'no one does that'."
It appears that people's brains and reasoning turn to mush when they see something that is seemingly cheap (ticket floggers) or will make them rich quick (e.g OneCoin)
"Skyscanner has introduced ratings for the companies it uses...far better than other comparison sites...and these roughly correspond with my experience..and the complaints on here.......another thing I noticed,yesterday I was doing some searches for a flight to Ukraine..Skyscanner pushed me direct to the budget airline site....Kayak tried to send me to a shonky at the same,or higher price for the same search!....make your own minds up..."
"That is a bit OTT don't you think Tim - you say ""..Skyscanner pushed me direct to the budget airline site..."" as if it happened automatically with no input from you whatsoever which is clearly ridiculous . Skyscanner is a comparison site - doesn't book anything on your behalf itself as it simply shows you various options and YOU then chose which to select which is the point at which things move to another website page - unless technology has come on leaps and bounds recently and I missed something the cursor on any computer screen still needs to be directed by the user and does not have on a life of its own"
#11914It was Kayak that did it...if you look how they show results it actually had a button saying 'view deal' against each deal it shows....and in the case of the result I was referring to the shonky was at the end of that particular result...other deals are listed in normal text underneath the result...and the airline direct was mentioned there...along with one other deal from a shonky....just checked the same result now to confirm...and while the results have obviously changed a bit...it still 'leads' you to a shonky first....it does seem to be a little strange...
"Just to update my post...and I do apologise for going OT...https:/…Lon to Kiev...29.12.19,,,direct....a day later than the post I just referenced...Cheapest LTN - IEV - £80 via Opodo2) Ryanair £125 - Opodo...obviously those will change regularly...but on frequent searches their results will mostly suggest shonkys as their 'view deal' result......just try Kayak...then compare with Skyscanner for budget airlines on direct routes..."
"This is my very first attempt of booking a flight from Nigeria to Ghana on travelgenio. The service being received presently is very horrible. I am even considering them as a scam. After payment and expecting a ticket to be issued. I checked their costumer- unfriendly site, only to be told ticket would be ready in few hours. After about an hour, I received a mail that my booking has been cancelled. NO REASON was stated, nor any information about the cash refund.No official customer email contact on the website. I had to scout for phone numbers to contact. Attempted calling twice at midnight and following morning, the phone rang for over 5 and 7minutes respectively. The calls were not picked.How do I manage such a situation. My booking and money are hanging in the hands of a STRANGER."
"you made a booking request to ask if they can get you a ticket at the advertised pricethey put a hold on your funds and then will see the real priceoften they come and ask you for more money to be able to issue the ticket, sometimes they don't and just cancel it.your hold should drop in a few days or speak to your card company.For live prices and instant confirmation you should be looking on the airline website - many online ticket floggers without tickets or live prices operate in exactly the same way as Travelgenio.Randomly selecting a company without doing any research is quite foolish....was it a cheap advert that attracted you?Edited: 3:13 am, December 17, 2019 "
Hello Afosemes. Of course we can help you to confirm your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check your booking status and will make sure you get this information as soon as possible. Regards.
"Yah stop booking with travelgenio they are really a big scammer.. I book a flight for two but they said my payment is pending and i not recieve any ticket from them.. My booking payment is pending but they deducted from my account RM 120.00 even They are saying that there is error with my payment.. I even ask them for which service they charges me the RM120.00 but no one answer me.. Do not book with skyscanner dont be a victim of this unhumane so called travel agency...Edited: 11:58 am, December 20, 2019 "
"""My booking payment is pending but they deducted fromm my account RM 120.00 even They are saying that there is error with my payment""---If you think there is no valid reason to be charged 120RM (unsure of currency (Malaysian Ringgit maybe?) so not sure what the equivalent is in GBP, or USD) then speak to your credit card provider and ask them to investigate the charge."
#1197RM 120 is a little over £20....quite a small amount of money....about the average price per person we spend with AirAsia for an off peak KL to Penang return flight......sounds like a hold on your account...dispute the charge if not sure with your card provider...
Hello JWonder0910. Of course we can help you to confirm your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check your booking status and will make sure you get this information as soon as possible. Regards.
If anyone show me any positive thing about travelgenio i will pay him.Booked twice and almost got heart attack both times they charge money than they dont send tickets and after hours of delay you get email price has increased your refund will be processed in few days and you lose time days and money my god how skyscanner is allowing them to operate through their site
there are many sites on Skyscanner that don't have live prices...the idea is to select who you want to book with based on reviews and reading the terms and conditions (not just picking the cheapest)If you want to see live prices you can do that on the airline website...beats submitting booking requests and hoping they can magic up a fare cheaper than the airline.
#1201'Booked twice and almost got heart attack both times'So after a narrow escape from your local Cardiac Unit you went back for more?....The men in the white coats will be around shortly....
"LoveTravel.Let me get this straight..... after getting burnt the first time, you decided to book with them again? Really?"
Hello Lovetravel639860. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"LoveTravel, you must enjoy the excitement of living life on the edge, never knowing what will happen next to have used this mob twice :-)"
Twice? You used them twice? Reminds me of that famous Lady Bracknell quote about losing parents.
You have the worst customer care ever! I have neither been able to get a reply neither to my emails neither to my calls to the Spanish and Italian offices.I paid an extra for an insurance I have not been able to use. And also extra money making useless calls nobody answered to.This is unbelievable. No respect for your clients at all.
"Hello Delia. Of we can help you manage your booking with insurance. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and what action you want to take (cancellation, refund, query, etc.) on your booking and we will let you know whether it is possible and what steps to take. Regards."
I have already done it. But I have not received any reply. I really do not know what else I should do…
"Delia.The Travelgenio bot always ""answers"" posts on here but we know only too well that nothing comes of the offers of help. As you can see, the bot has posted almost 4000 times now. So many unhappy customers but hopefully, a lot less people who will use Travelgenio again! No human from the company ever reads this forum I can assure you."
"Yes, I have seen. Thank you for your message and comprehension. I am so upset…If they do not give me the service I paid for I will surely proceed legally. And for sure I will tell everyone I know about this awful behavior. I hope nobody will use their services anymore."
Please be sure to post back to keep us advised as how the legal proceedings go.
">>for sure I will tell everyone I know about this awful behavior<<Trip Advisor already has several thousands of warnings about Travelgenio. Why do you think your warning will have any effect?>>I hope nobody will use their services anymoreAlas, there will always be people (like you) who throw money at Travelgenio without doing any research."

Travelgenio ripped me off £1250 when they cancelled my flight and never refunded. Total sham of a company. Skyscanner is letting RIP off merchants sell flights which should be criminal.
"Thank you for contacting us 7uhvc56. As you know, refund times depend on the policies of the various airlines, as they are the ones who approve and manage refunds. In any case, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference so that we can check the status of processing with the airline. Thank you."
"I wish Delia had actually told us more about what the problem with her booking was - ie the flight not available at the price she expected /she wanted to cancel a non refundable ticket etc or indeed whether the ""booking"" ever happened at all and never got as far as the recipt of a booking confirmation . It isn't clear what the insurance mentioned actually was either - travel insurance, cancellation protection cover … she has given us far too little information for anyone to have an indication of how successful going down the route of seeking legal redress (Post 1208 refers) will be . My main question to Delia at this point is ""did you read all the T&Cs carefully before booking - if not why not, and have you now checked carefully to see what you signed up to?"" There is no point indignantly trying to seek legal redress if you don't have a strong case because you accepted T&Cs which have not worked in your favourEdited: 6:52 am, December 26, 2019 "
My flight home for Christmas got cancelled and they never sent me an email. I ended up paying 200£ for a new flight and had to call them to get my refund. Customer service person was the rudest ever. Never again.
"Hello Michal, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with your refund. Bear in mind that the refund times depend on the airlines. As soon as the airline processes it, you will receive your refund via the form of payment you used to make your booking. Anyway, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check the status of your refund and will give you an approximate time for its processing. Regards."
"Cause of airline canceled the flights and I've sent millions of e-mails to request for cancel my booking and refund, however did not receive any reply so far, Travelgenio is really a awful agent, never ever trade with them."
"'Cause of airline canceled the flights and I've sent millions of e-mails to request for cancel my booking and refund, however did not receive any reply so far'If the carrier cancelled the flight and if your credit card was charged you should receive a refund. After the first two or three emails to wretched Travelgenio did you try contacting your credit card supplier to let them deal with this awful company? If not why not?"
"Hello David L, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with the changes in your booking. Airlines sometimes make changes to their flight schedules, totally beyond the control of Travelgenio. In any case, our agents can help you find an alternative within the options offered by the airline. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will look for possible alternatives for you if this does not suit your needs. Regards."
"I booked return flights for 27th/30th December with Travelgenio on 20 October and paid in full £216. When I went to check I on 26 December I found that the airline had no record of the booking.Subsequently contacted Travelgenio Customer Service who apologised and explained that due to an error on their system, they had omitted to make the reservations in October. They very helpfully gave me two options:1. They would give me an expedited refund of the original amount2. Or I could make a further payment to secure the flights at the last minute booking rate.Oh, and they apologised again. But no supervisors were available to assist.I ended up having to book the flights last minute at an additional £130 over and above the original October price.Travelgenio refused to accept any responsibility for this additional cost despite it being entirely due to a fault in their systems.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IRRESPONSIBLE RIP OFF MERCHANTSAfter posting I was privileged to receive a response from the “Advanced Support Department“ at Travelgenio.Unfortunately it was the usual nonsense and they continue to deliberately ignore their contractual obligation to provide the flights I bought and paid for in October. Their systems fail and they refuse to stand up an take responsibility for their obligations. Do you really want to do business with this company?"
Of course we can help you in relation to your booking and all the Booking process. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"10 days past, my booking still remain and did not receive any message from Travelgenio and I've already posted my own dealing experience with Travelgenio onto local travelers' forum.To Travelgenio management: If you have time to reply same message on this forum, why do not look into Travelgenio's customer service mail box to see how many requisition still pending or unsolved?"
"Hi David, could you send a private message with your booking code? We will track your mails to find out why you have not received no response after contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regard"
"Hi Travelgenio Customer Service,I booked flights from Travelgenio via Skyscanner in Sep 2019 and my flights were amended without any authorization (the stopover time was amended from 3 hours to 17 hours!!); I requested for a refund on 1st Oct 2019 and received a confirmation from you but it’s been more than 90 days since the refund was requested, I still have not received the payment. On day 93, Jan 2020, I called and you told me that the airline company has not authorized the refund yet so I have to wait and they don’t know how long it would take!!! This has been more than 3 months of back and forth communicating and disappointing experience.Please suggest a resolution - I just would like to have my payment back."
"Jill:I'm sorry this happened to you. This is not a Travelgenio website. At best, the ""bot"" that posted just above your post will post the same thing, changing the name to Jill from David.Feel free to write to the e-mail address in that post to see if they can help you, but I don't recall anyone coming back here to say Travelgenio did anything to help them. They are a bad company to work with and if you are lucky, the new flights you have will actually accommodate you.If you have not reported this to your credit card company for a chargeback, do not wait any longer to do so.Edited: 8:10 am, January 04, 2020 "
"Hello Jill. Let us check the status of the refund with the airline, as you know it is the airline that manages and approves refunds. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking so we can raise the query? The refund times vary depending on the airline. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, regards."
"I was promised by Travelgenio by at least 10 e- mails that they process my prblem with a double booking. Still I did not recieve my refund.When I called the 22 Desember they said 2 days.After 2 day I call them again they said 7 days. Then I recieved an email they paid me, but I did not recieve my money back. Then I call again they said 3 days. Still no refund. It seems like Travelgenio took my money and just make empty promises day after day week after week.I am really disapaointed because I trusted their system. I am learning a hard lesson never to use TRAVELGENIO again. If I not reciev my money doon will contact the travel agencuy news papaers to expose them to the public as a unreliable corrupt company."
Could you tell us your booking code in a private message?
"Avoid buying tickets via travelgenio.com at all cost. I bought flight tickets on their site. On every page there was a discount. I have accepted the ""total price"" and they have blocked 100 euro extra from my account, then charged it (that's why I didn't get sms from bank to confirm the price). I tried to explain this ""mistake"" with their support. It took me 2 weeks to explain it to them but they didn't want to refund me the price difference, according to them, everything is correct. So it wasn't a mistake, it was a fraud! I totally don't recommend this company."

TravelGenio will wait for the refund from the airline before they refund you. Has Tarom confirmed they have issued the refund to TG?

I'm having a similar situation with my booking VSG46O. Airline has changed the return flight which we cannot make. I've asked for a refund but haven't even had a response despite numerous emails and phone calls which continually get cut off! Can someone please advise?
Thank you Nicole for your feedback. Your opinion will help us as we continue working to improve our service. We will review your case and one of our agents will contact you shortly. Regards.
I had same thing happen to me too travelgenio is scammer website be awere of it i think sky scanner should get rid of such scammer!
"Well as long as TG keeps paying skyscanner to advertise there, they wont get rid of them.You need to research the advertised companies before handing over your money rather than blindly click and buy from the cheapest fares displaying.Caveat emptor"
"Like any adverts the customer could spend a few minutes doing some research before randomly selecting the cheapest advert on a comparison site.Thousands of warnings out there...many many poor third parties that work in the same way. Either book direct with the airline or accept that you may be seeing a non-live price, read the terms and conditions very carefully (there are a couple of third parties who have truly awful terms and conditions I cannot believe that anyone who accepts them has ever read them) understand the extra fees for making any changes, the rules on cancelling, you may be without your money for a few months if the advertised (suck-in) price is not available....your money, your choice who to give it to"
Hello Sunianthew. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"Worst agency I worked with !!! Long service and does not solve anything. It takes a long time to respond by email. They made a mistake in booking, doing it in duplicate and now say that the Airline was the one who made a mistake. Moral of the story they canceled the reservation and now I have no money or tickets !!!Experience not to repeat !!!!The only thing that works seems to be managing those comments on websites and social networks, they are super quick to respond !!!!"
Hello Relax. Of course we can help you to confirm your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check your booking status and will make sure you get this information as soon as possible. Regards.
">>>The only thing that works seems to be managing those comments on websites and social networks, they are super quick to respond !!!!<<<Bots can work 24 hours a day. What's more they want breaks or holidays, and they very rarely fall ill. The only problem is all they can do is post messages over and over again."
You can send a complaint to Skyscanner. it will help.
">>You can send a complaint to Skyscanner. it will help<<No, it will not. Travelgenio pays Skyscanner to be included in the results, and Skyscanner will not refuse payment from an advertiser."

Well done 386catlover. Have a good trip
Travelgenio is a real scam. I booked a ticket with them in september 2019 for a trip in december 2019. The flight timings changed in october 2019 and i had to cancel my booking. They told me i could get a full refund within 3 months from the cancellation. It has been almost 4 months (its feb 2020 today) and i have yet to receive anything from them. Not even an apology email to acknowledge my refund. NOTHING at all. I have tried to call them multiple times to check on the status of my refund and time and again they didnt seemed like they were going to refund me my money. I have no idea when will i ever get my money back or if i ever will get this money back. STAY AWAY EVERYONE.
"Sorry this happened to you, Zac.I hope you have learned to research before using companies like this instead of finding 1000+ complaints after you get ripped off."
"Hello Zac, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with your refund. Bear in mind that the refund times depend on the airlines. As soon as the airline processes it, you will receive your refund via the form of payment you used to make your booking. Anyway, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and we will check the status of your refund and will give you an approximate time for its processing. Regards."
"Travelgenio are useless! I’ve booked through them once and never again!!! I booked flights in November last year to which they cancelled and I am still waiting for my full refund. I am now being told I am not allowed a refund on my luggage and extras that I have had. I booked no extras! One person tells me my refund is on its way.. nearly 12 weeks later... and another tells me I’m not entitled to it, even though I didn’t cancel my flights! So now I’m short but still having to source alternative flights. There a joke!!!"
"Thank you Claire for your feedback. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
Claire stop messing around with them and contact your credit card provider and dispute the payment. You should have done this a couple of months ago but hopefully you can still do it.
"Well, we did the booking with payment via PayPal. To be honest, I hate PayPal. But it this situation they solved the issue in a wink:--------We reviewed the information regarding the below claim and have accepted your claim.We credited the full disputed transaction amount of 541,83 EUR to the original funding source you used to complete this transaction. The credit should reflect in your original funding source within 5 business days. If you paid using a card, the money will be refunded to your card. It can take up to 30 days for the refund to appear on your card statement, depending on your card issuer's timeframes.This case is now closed. We are sorry that you experienced a problem with this transaction, but hope you are happy with the outcome of this case."
"I agree, the same happened to me several times now & it's a big waste of time. Skyscanner should do sth about this form of false advertising"
#1277'the same happened to me several times now'You need a double visit from the Travelgenio Bot.....then perhaps a lobotomy for going back for more!
"Hello Nicole P, we are sorry that your experience was not as you hoped. Please could you send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com to let us review your case? Regards."
">>Skyscanner should do sth about this form of false advertising<<So long as Skyscanner is paid, it will include these adverts. Just like your local newspaper."
Re Post 1278 - your comments are harsh but true tim r - why would anybody choose to keep going back for more if they could avoid it is beyond me
1281 'your comments are harsh but true tim r'Must be something in the water....
Nicole it's very disappointing that you seem to expect a commercial website like Skyscanner to protect you rather than protecting yourself.Take some responsibility for looking after your money.
Yes they are fraud company. Never ever go with them. They have cheated with me and charged very heavy price. FAKE FAKE FAKE

Well you will get a reaction from the bot no doubt. Doubtful if that will mean any help though.WS there a reason for choosing such a terrible ticket flogger? Is there any recourse through the payment method you used. I know there is when you pay by credit card and there isn’t when you pay by bank transfer but I’m not famiarnwith the method you used.
"I just made yesterday a reservation for flights from Helsinki to Tokyo. Paid with Trustly. Now Travelgenio claims they don’t have my payment. I sent them proof of payment by email, they claim they haven’t received that proof from my bank. Customer service person wants to stop helpinh me on the phone and won’t provide me with any optio s other than to pay for the flights again with a credit card. In the previous call the customer service person asked me to obtain proof of payment wich I got for them. Horrible service, seems like a scam. My reservation number is 17547915 if Travelgenio would react through here."
"I see you’ve removed your original post, and reposted it again - but this time including your reservation number. Not a wise thing to do, you should keep reservation numbers, email addresses and telephone numbers private and not post them on public forums."
"mikkol79... if Travelgenio have not accepted your payment, maybe this is the time to rejoice, then go book with the airline direct or at least find a reputable ticket flogger."
Thank you for your feedback Mik kol. One of our agents will contact you to clarify what happened in about 48 hours .
"Booked a couple of seats at $220 each, got an e-mail 3 hours later saying payment could not be completed, re-tried, turned out the first payment had been processed, then did the second one..only got a partial refund, so the $440 flights ended up being$600 as they said to cancel the first payment would be 50 euros per ticket.I learned my lesson I guess."

Travelgenio is the worst company ever . They are scammers . Ive been promised a refund for over 5 months and they have yet refund the money . DONT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THEM
"Thank you for contacting us. As you know, refund times depend on the policies of the various airlines, as they are the ones who approve and manage refunds. In any case, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference so that we can check the status of processing with the airline. Thank you."
"They're horrible! You did the right thing not booking with them. Even though I paid the lowest price, it might be a con company.Due to coronavirus epidemic, I had to cancel my trip. AirChina is issuing a full refund without any questions, so it shall be easy for travelgenio to get the money back and give me full refund. However, I have been sending messages to their French, UK, US and many other branches since weeks now, and I haven't heard any word from them! My travel is due in 5 days! Honestly, I have never seen such a bad travel company in my life (and I travel very often). Another point is that, the return flight is rescheduled and travelgenio still shows my itinerary as the previous flight status. It feels like they are ghosting all the news updates as a company. As the icing on the cake, they do not provide any phone number in 'contact us' section, you can only fill in a contact form - which they never reply.Bearing in mind that there can be an epidemic, or a life and death situation at any given time, I would not suggest using travelgenio services, if you don't want to die or being literally forced to take the flights (even though all air companies have stopped flights to the regions where epidemic is taking thousands of lives and even the airline company is making no problem issuing a refund) or take this easily resolvable issue to the court and lose extra time and energy."

Surely there is a us site of Skyscanner that will give you the price in USD? It may be worth noting that if you need to make any changes or cancel a flight this is more difficult through any third party. Therefore I would reiterate that it’s best to book direct with the airline.
"This is quite a scammy site as I experienced on Saturday(15th Feb)/Sunday(16th Feb). I tried paying for a ticket late on Saturday Night. I was told they could not charge my card to pay for my ticket only to wake up to a debit notification from my bank with a lesser amount on Sunday Morning. I reached out to TravelGenio, and up till now. nothing has been done to return my money. They did not even book my for a ticket and I got charged!"
Thank you for contacting us Temi. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what queries you have so we can get you an answer. Thank you.
Travelgenio is scammer. Stay away from this site. They took money from my bank for a ticket that was never booked . Skyscanner should not cooperate with this kind of sites .
I have done so.

PLEASE RETURN MY REFUND"
"@ Post 1307 by DTT ( BTW your posts 1308 & 1309 have been reported as duplicate posts and are likely to be removed) - which is it - 5 months as you originally said or nearly a year? In post 1307 you said your claim had been in process since March yet the comments you made in Post 1295 on 14 Feb 2020 said you had been waiting for ""5 months"" which by my reckoning would only make it since October 2019 ( not that that isn't quite a long time) .Perhaps if you gave more info people about the scenario might be able to understand your difficulty better because most flights booked through OTAs like this firm are strictly non refundable so it is difficult to see what exactly the refund you are expecting would relate to?Edited: 12:25 pm, February 19, 2020 "
Thank you for contacting us. One of our agents will contact you within the next 48 hours.
1310'which is it - 5 months as you originally said or nearly a year?'And it accuses TG of being liars?Even the name is infused with CAPLOCKS....No doubt the Travelnotbenio Bot will be around with soothing words....and more than a few laughs behind this liars back...
Is there any reason to believe that DTT won't still be waiting in 5 months or a year's time?I don't think there is.

"Travel Genio, You have still refused to send my refund despite following up. You rep sent a mail on Monday 24th Feb saying:""Thanks for getting back in contact with us.We regret to inform you that as the weekend was between this transaction and our administrative department is closed during the weekend you will receive the concerned amount in the following 2/3 working days.We apologize for the inconveniences this situation might have caused and we fully appreciate your patience and understanding.""It's been over week since then and nothing has happened.Kindly return my money. This is a terrible way to do business and I am very disappointed."
"Temi - this is NOT Travelgenio There is no point posting on a forum on TRIPADVISOR.

I am having same problems helping my son who has a handicap (deaf) . My son Jeremiah Lawrence ( KEZXRM) had booked three tickets to Japan on ANA on 20 March 2020 . Because of Covid 19 - I am trying to cancel the ticket . Was informed by ANA - have to cancel only thro the travel agency . Can be cancelled with no extra charge He had sent an email twice no reply . I have tried (0034911160765) calling five days in a row - no one picks the phone. I too have my doubts - is this a real company ???
Thank you for contacting us lilyramah. One of our agents will contact you within the next 72 hours.

"I just had a call from person from your customer service at 9.45am (Malaysian time ) . He said his name is Pedro ( Bred ) from a US number +1(973)-850-9687 .

""When I asked him whom should I contact him about refund """"The person has gone to the washroom""What should I do now?"
"No refund, no costumer service and no way to contact them. Everything about them reeks of SCAM. I think almost 4 months is enough time to give me back my money. What do you think travelgenio?"

"I am sending this message to warn you guys from booking with travelgenio. i worked very hard in order to be able to offer myself some holidays. i decided to purchase a plane ticket through Travelgenio. and that was my mistake. Travelgenio without any scrupIe take advantages of people. the company TAP didn't let me board the flight and Travelgenio doesn't want to refund me my money. I had to buy another plane ticket. Despite me sending them all the proofs by emails. They are actually asking me to check directly with the company. I didn't book with the company. As a third part, is it the role of travelgenio to take care of that. Otherwise what will be the point of being a third part. We can from now on book directly with the company without having to go through travelgenio. I am sorry but i will post this message everywhere and every single day in order to warn all the honest people out there. Travelgenio are scammers. I sent several mails and still now i have not received any feedback yet regarding my refund. The company didn't let me board. I sent several emails proving that this situation has nothing to do with me. I didn't book my tickets with the company i booked it through travel Travelgenio. so Travelgenio need to reimburse me. not the company. I am so sad to discover that travelgenio are SCAMMERS. DO NOT BOOK TICKETS WITH THEM."" i will make sure no one will ever have to book through your website. you guys will loose a lot of clients trust me. #TRAVELGENIO #TRAVELGENIOSCAMMERS"
"""TAP didn't let me board the flight"" Why? Can you tell us more, please? Was it because you did not have the required travel documents?""I sent several emails proving that this situation has nothing to do with me."" Again, what happened?""i will make sure no one will ever have to book through your website."" If you think you are the first one, who said this, then you are wrong. As a hint, you are posting is number 1338. And there are other threads. There are plenty of warnings out there, but people tend not to read them, before they run into problems."
Thioye - why were you denied boarding by TAP?If it because they never issued a ticket from your booking request then speak to your card company. (were you checking your booking regularly on the airline website?)regarding warnings...there are thousands on this forum alone....people that choose to book with third parties often look at an advertised price and choose not to do any research so will likely not see your warnings in the same way you didn't see the ones that have been posted for years
"I have just been on Trust Pilot where most people have rated Travelgenio 1 star out of 5.A lady called Sue is really unhappy and has slated the company saying how bad it is etc etc and the Bot they use on there replied....""We are glad to know you appreciated your experience with us. Satisfying our customers is our main goal"".You have to see it to believe it!!!Edited: 8:41 am, March 08, 2020 "
"I agree Thioye - nothing you poston here or Trust Pilot etc will make a lbind bit of difference to Travelgenio carrying on trading while there is a constant supply of potential clients all chasing the ""super bargain"" myth As others have said - if you are seeking sympathy for your ""denied boarding"" experience you need to explain WHY you were denied boarding by TAP- for example if you had a ticket but not the correct visa/ passport validity etc you cannot blame that on the ticket flogger you bought the ticket from"
"Thanks for your feedback Thioye. We would like to review your case in detail. For this, please could you contact us at customer.service@travelgenio.com, telling us what happened. Many thanks"
"'He said his name is Pedro ( Bred ) from a US number +1(973)-850-9687 . This is what he said: ""Yes , I will cancel the ANA tickets to Japan but you will be backlisted from ever entering Japan ""' Good grief - that's a new low, even for wretched Travelgenio. The threat of being 'backlisted' was a lie.When I ask him about refund : "" No refund will be given . ""' Translation - I can't be bothered to process the transaction or (more likely) I don't know how to do it.When I asked him whom should I contact him about refund "" ""The person has gone to the washroom""' No surprises there.'What should I do now?' Cup of tea and a few deep breaths. If ANA are still operating the flights then there may not be a refund if your son does not wish to travel. What he may be able to do is rebook for a future date, but that will mean paying ANA's change fee, any difference in fares, and you'll have to do it through Travelgenio.You could call ANA, tell them you've booked through a third party, but ask if they can provide the details of the change fee and change in fares for when your son would like to travel. If he does not want to travel at all then ask ANA what their cancellation fee will be and what you may expect as a refund. Again tell them you understand you have to deal with the agent but would like to know what to expect in terms of money refunded.You or your son may decide that what you'd receive after dealing with Travelgenio isn't worth the hassle of doing so, but for the details of what to expect you'll need to speak to ANA."

"We booked a flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh for 4/1/20. The flight was 'changed or cancelled' on 10/12/19 I.e. pre-coronavirus outbreak.

I phoned Travelgenio on that day to find that the airline had cancelled the flight (but they would not explain why my booking was now showing a car reservation). I was only offered a flight with the same airline but on a different day, which was no good as we had a connecting flight from London. I asked for my money back.The airline contacted me on 27 December to say that I had to ask Travelgenio to get my money back.On 2 March Travelgenio emailed me to ask how my flight booked with them went!! I immediately wrote back to ask for the status on my refund. Silence. It is now 91 days since my flight was cancelled. Our reservation on the system is still showing the Madrid car booking presumably to use my refund to pay for a non-existent service so that they do not have to pay me.Fortunately we used a credit card to pay for the flights and I will now be contacting AmEx to report Travelgenio for fraudulent activity to get my money back from them.If Travelgenio cannot refund a flight cancelled pre-coronavirus, then there is no hope for any bookings made for the coronavirus period. It also looks very likely as though the company is acting fraudulently by not passing back our refund."
"Our agents are trying to speed up the response process as much as possible, but they also depend on the time in which the airlines respond to the requests. You will be contacted during next days, as soon as possible. regards"
[Ticket #3279578] Redound Ticket #3278722] Cancellation
Totally agreethey are cheating people
"Travelgenio Travel agent is one of the worst company I have ever dealt with, due to the following:( so I am recommendation - don't look to save few money by booking with Travelgenio then definitely you will the loser at end) For last one week I am chasing them to change my flight through online form , email and calls and always no response. ( although stating on hold for phone calls more than 15 min).Yesterday they said we will send link to make 40Euro payment (due to change request) in order to proceed as it is service fees then call back because they are busy on other phone calls, which i don't know why I have to pay any money since Emirates Airline make changes free of charge in this time due to Corona Virus.Any how they didn't send any link, and I called back today and requested to cancel the booking at all due to their unprofessional , they sent me link in same time I made the payment then they advised in the same phone call it was misleading info from their side and payment I have done is not accepted!!! and again you have to make online where they never response to me. ( it is kind of direct cheating )!!I really don't know how this company work as travel agent for a reputable company like Emirates Airline or Skyscanner, I booked them through Skyscanner,offcousre will never work with Travelgenio any more , even Skyscanner will never work with them as well.If they won't proceed with refunding my payment I will proceed with legal case"
>>I really don't know how this company work as travel agent for a reputable company like Emirates Airline or Skyscanner<<Airlines will let any agency sell their tickets. Skyscanner takes money from its advertisers and does no checking.It is your responsibility to investigate any company before you throw money at it.
"SO do you mean that even any fake agency can sell tickets for Airline?It gives a lot of room for frauds.Also affect the reputation for the source you purchased the ticket "" like Skyscanner """
"Saied S, Our agents are trying to speed up the response process as much as possible, but they also depend on the time in which the airlines respond to the requests. You will be contacted as soon as possible during next days. regards"
"Thank you for contacting us loai_eng. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference, stating what change you want to make, and one of our agents will get back during next days (mails are being replied according to reception queue) to indicate the airline’s conditions for the fare in this regard. Thank you"
"On any commercial web site, you should assume that *any* link is a paid advertisement, and carry out research before you make any payment."
"Skyscanner is no more the source than a newspaper is for an ad for a local business.Skyscanner is a search engine. It displays results. (Results from companies who’ve paid them to be displayed there). You as a consumer, have the choice which (if any) links you click on. Iys your mkney and travel,plans. You need to satisfy yourself that any company you ask to be your agent is reputable and reliable. I’m guessing yiu didn’t do that as your sole criteria was cheap? Cheap doesn’t get you great or even good.Next you appear to not understand what it means when you willingly choose to place a middleman between you and the supplier. You also appear to have just clicked to accept terms & conditions without reading them and understanding that you need to lay this ticket flogger for any ancillary support or service (that’s how they keep prices cheap).So you’re not Emirates customer, Travelgenio are. Travelgenio are not Skyscanner’s or Emirates agent, they are your agent and you Ickes them. (Emirates are more than happy for you to be their customer and buy directly from them, you chose not to do that).Emirates will allow their customers to make changes free of charge. In this case that isn’t you but TG. TG are entitled to charge you the service fees you agreed to, to make the change for you.TG seem to nave pretty poor after sales support at the best of times. They and all other ticket floggers are swamped with cancellations by airlines and customers like you wanting to cancel or change their flights. You’re going to have to wait until they get around to dealing with you.I aPpreciste you’re frustrated and upset by the situation you find yourself in. You appear to be rather naive when it comes to buying online. You’ve got the opportunity to learn from the mistakes you e made and protect yourself when buying online in the future.Good luck getting this sorted out. Their bot will be along soon to post some sort of eeassurance. It seems to be no longer saying response within 72 hours but Thayer trying and will get around to replying, which indicates it could be close to a week to get a response now."
Booking code: VK2W6OI just want to cancel my booking now.I already paid cancellation amount via your link has sent to me by email.After my payment your customer service lady informed me that it is not possible to proceed ?!!And I have to go again to make the request for cancellation online and pay again?!!Where online you never response for last 8 days
"Why have you posted that message on here loai_eng ? Ths is a public discussion - nothing at all to do with Travelgenio. Individuals who post on TripAdvisor do so as private citizens - they are not employees of TG or help desk staff. It is possible that the Tralgenio ""Bot"" ( our name for the robotic responder who posts up here from time to time) may post a generic message asking you to email TG about your case, but that is all that will happen - you need to continue to discuss your cancellation issues direct with Travelgenio's customer service personnelEdited: 9:42 am, March 11, 2020 "

Hello Loai_eng. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.
We are stuck with this irresponsible agent who don’t respond to email and calls
"I would not agree they are irresponsible. They are hopeless in good times and unable to cope now.The ones that are irresponsible were the people who chose to use them without researching them first. There are thousands of complaints going back years long before Covid-19 made things so difficult. Picking the cheapest you can find on a search engine and not bothering to spend 5 minutes checking out how bad they are, is completely irresponsible in my view."
Hello Amsaraj. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"Asmaraj. The reply you have had from Travelgenio has been posted by a bot. It is one of its stock answers. You will find thousands (4000 pus to be more precise) of the same replies on this forum, so do not get your hopes up!!!Good luck.Edited: 1:39 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"@ TravelGenio , I am receiving a reply from you here only.Never receive any reply to my emails & online form request.I received below message from you in TA forum that you will send me email for refund.Actually You have sent the email to me which finally there is action from your side, but you didn't cancel my ticket and refund my money."
"Is the travelgenio replied here is a bot? it seems almost same on all forum. I left another 72 hours before my departure. However, it seems no future to be cancelled or get refunded by them.Booking Code Travelgenio: 16992040Booking Code Sabre : HPIBXDIf I did not get any refund process, I will try my best to file a fraud case report on the company. Hopefully, they will not do this to others. Really disappointed."
"No need to post on all the threads. The bot will reply to you shortly.Next time, find this forum first and see how bad a company is before you give them your hard earned money"
"For sure next time will go for it. Everyone happen to face the same issue are all first timer. Next time for sure, no one will bother. Yes I am repeating on each forum. So that everyone know that as previously i did not aware at all. 3 days left before departure, restless, pointless, no hope at all. Really really disappointed. Please skyscanner, REMOVE TRAVELGENIO in your list!!!!"
"Anyone who finds any of the dozens of threads here about the company quickly knows they are bad. Posting in every thread is spamming.Post once here, post once each in other travel boards if you must, but understand there are millions of folks like you who jump at a cheap fare and do zero research first and will find these warnings.Edited: 4:04 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Absolutely Northern Traveller. There is NO point people posting the same thing over and over - it is an exceptional time of crisis - this company doesn't offer great customer contact at the best fof times ( low cost outfit=few staff to deal with admin) and I am sure that their systems are currently overwhelmed . Everyone is just going to have to join the quque of thos waitng fro refunds to process AND remember that once they submit an amendment enquiry to TG, there will be a perios while the company contacts the airline for a refund (TG will not pay until it gets the money back itself) and then your claim will join the queue of many others waiting for the staff in the accounting dept to process the refund (deducting their own admin fees during the process) and actually send the funds to the individual's account . I doubt anyone is going to get a refund immediately - several weeks minimum would seem to be a more likely scenario."
"Hello Fauzan. One of our agents will contact you shortly. Thank you, regards."
hi how can i comtact you guys from nz pls
"Hi Netts, Due to the amount of queries received by mail and call center, our reply times have increased. Please contact us through customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will contact you asap during next days. Regards"
"I have called 16 times in last 24 hours nobody answers the phone. I got on hold then at 12 minuets automatically get hung up on every time. I have sent numerous emails to no avail. I live in the U.S. and tried calling airline directly they said you have to do cancellation. confirmation is aksv1w.Barbados is level three travel advisory. consulate recommends not traveling unless necessary. So I can't even get to Barbados to take this flight. also st. lucia is restricting travel and prime minister is in quarantine. They also advise not traveling to island unless necessary. To Boot, my daughter is in quarantine due to a fever so we can't even board a plane to get there. Can you please cancel and refund us?thank you,Kyley"
"Travelgenio is a f*** Scammer! Do not ever book with them! We had a situation in the airport, were there’s an involuntary travel ban of Philippine Government to travel in Taiwan. We were in the airport but the airlines did not allowed us to check-in. We tried to contact Travelgenio, emailed and called them, first it is so hard to contact them, and by the time we have contacted them, all their INDIAN AGENTS HANGED UP. NO SOLUTION PROVIDED, WE KEEP BACK IN FORT WITH THEM AND WITH THE AIRLINES. Customer service of the airlines were so nice and helpful and change the status of of our booking so Travelgenio could process a refund. Then we received an email from Travelgenio that our refund is already process and should wait for 7 days, and after this days passed, we should contact our BANK to confirm the repayment/reimbursement. Then It’s been more than 15 days, I called our bank and no authorization or refund yet. And NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE IN TRAVELGENIO. We have emailed them and called several times, but no one is replying. THEY ARE SCAM!!! WE SHOULD TELL IT TO SKYSCANNER! THEY ARE ALSO TO BLAME FOR HAVING THIS SCAM COMPANY IN THEIR SYSTEM!!!"
"There is no point in telling Skyscanner. Travelgenio pays Skyscanner to advertise on the site, and Skyscanner does not carry out any checks on its advertisers.But you also have to be reasonable. Evey travel-related call centre in the world is in meltdown right now, and you will get delays whether you are calling a full-service airline or a crappy outfit like Travelgenio."
Hello Kyley. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.

Please can I get my flights cancelled and a full refund because I am no longer able to travel due to Shanghai's coronavirus quarantine restrictions.My booking reference is: LHDLVJ. Before you reply telling me to contact you by email, I have done three times now as well as sending you a private message over Tripadvisor and calling your customer service and being stuck on hold for hours!"

I've sent three. no response. called...no answer. we are travel advisory level 4. cannot even leave the country. please help and refund this
"Hello travelgenio,I have booked a flight for etihad through your service on March 12th 2020 from abu dhabi to india. My departure date is on 26th March 2020 but my etihad flight is cancelled to COVID-19. So who is responsible for my refund. either by you or etihad"
For your info my booking reference is IMSTMM on Etihad airways. I have requested through your call center as well and my ticket number is 3449413
venigalla.This is NOT the ticket agent Travelgenio.This is the Trip Advisor Air Travel forum.If you take time to read some of the posts on this thread you will see that the Travelgenio Bot....not an actual person...replies to most of the posts with the same useless response. They are not interested in helping out their customers and it is no use at all posting your ticket number on this website!
"Hi KYLEY J, our agents are trying to prioritize the mails according to the flight dates. Due to the amount of queries, we are doing our best to hurry the replies but sending more than one is not helping us.

"this is not true, I have done those steps it's been DAYS nobody responds. nobody answers the phone, you now changed the flight to take off out of spain. I cannot make the flight, level 4 travel advisory taking off out of a completely different country. most unprofessional website I have ever seen."
"@ Travelgenio , What are you doing?!!I have two booking reservations ,flights on Emirates Airline, Emirates Airline sent me email that both Reservations have been canceled due to countries travel restriction.So you have to send back my refund immediately ( I sent you several emails , online form & even here request to refund my money , and you confirmed here that you will refund the money)Yesterday received email from you that you changed my flight departure date based on your choice ?!!!!What is that?!Seems that you will never expedite my refund without opening fraud case against you."

"Hello Jane. One of our agents will contact you shortly. Thank you, regards."
"Jane,Unfortunately you have been answered by the very overworked Travelgenio Bot. I'm sorry but no human reads the posts on here as you can tell by the replies the Bot posts. Half the time it is thanking people for saying how bad the company is!If you do manage to get any help, please never ever book via them or any shonky third party ticket seller again. Just buy directly with the airline and cut out the middle man.Good luck and do please let people on here know if you get any help from Travelgenio.Thanks."
"Hello Dear bookers,I am writing this email to give you updates regarding my non-reimbursed case with travelGenio.first of all, this happened before the ""Corona Virus Situation"". I was at the airport and the company didn't let me board. Despite me having all the recquired documents. I had to book on the spot two others tickets in order to be able to go back home. and i am not even mentionning the extra night i had to pay at the hotel. It was such a disgrace. Now I need my money back. Travelgenio need to Reimburse me. I made my purchase through their website. I sent them emails showing the documents I received from the Head officer of tap mentionning all the details and the tickets purchased afterwards. They still don't want to refund me.TravelGenio doesn't have any excuses. They simply don't want to take their responsabilities. As a Third part, it's their role to make sure everything went smoothly for the customers. I know, as a customers we can be very demanding and annoying but this is definitely not right. From my perspective they are only here for their pockets. I can't blame them for that but the service need to be on point. And what sadden me the most, is the fact that none of the agents i had over the phone wanted to pass me to their managers. Disgusting !!!Hopefully this whole corona virus situation will be over soon and we will all go back to our daily routine. In the meantime do not book with them they are scammers :)."
"One of my flights got cancelled due to coronavirus outbreak, so I reached out to Travelgenio to cancel the whole reservation and they told me that I need to pay 180 euro fee! 20 hours to my flight and I still don't know what is the status. Never again. Next time I will only book with the airline directly."
Hello Aleksandra. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking cancel and refund. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
Alexsandra.You have been answered by the very overworked Travelgenio Bot. This is just one of his 5 or 6 stock replies! No human has read your post.Sorry.
"My advise:Seems in normal days and without Corona, Travelgenio performance was extremely bad.Imagine with current circumstances !!! I believe only way nowadays for any pending matters with Travelgenio & if possible to open fraud case otherwise you won't get your money after a year.off course will never book neither with Travelgenio nor with Skyscanner. I don't have time for each booking to make survey on travel agent and I don't think Skyscanner have any interfere on travel agent performance or selection, they also want easy money"
"Worst customer service ever. My flights were cancelled due to corona virus outbreak, which I totally understand. However when I asked on the phone how to be refunded, I was asked to pay 30e and agree immediately while being on the phone. When I asked where it is stated in their T&Cs that when a trip needs to be cancelled independently from the customer's will, the customer has to pay a fee. The customer representative called me ""stupid"", became aggressive and hanged up on me without bringing me any solution but insults and attitude. There was no discussion possible and he refused to transfer me to a colleague of his (the call took place on Tuesday 24.03 at starting at 20.28). I tried calling a second time. The second representative started to yell at me on the phone asking to take decisions NOW, to pay 30 euro and to cancel a reservation. Same situation: she refused to tell me and told me that I either accept or she hangs up. While hanging up she quietly mumbled “bitch” before the call was disconnected. Although I understand that the representatives are under pressure due to the current situation, but how can such practices be allowed? How can such tone and methods be acceptable towards their clients? I felt harassed and shamed by the customer service for asking for explanation, other solutions, etc.TERRIBLE doesn't begin to describe TravelIngenio. To be avoided at all cost."
"You agreed to pay their fees when you a. Elted gheir terms and conditions.…travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and…There is no avoiding that if you want to see any of your refund. They’re not going to give you a solution that means they work for free.Yes they’re terrible, we know that from the thousands of complaints on here alone."
"I mean there are 1400 posts in this thread, Heidi, and 2 dozen other threads telling you this is a horrible company and yet you gave them your money anyway . . . Not sure how else to warn folks away . . ."
You can't. :(

"Heidi - why have you posted this on here ? This is a TripAdvisor public forum not Travelgenio. You would be better of asking that sort of question on one of the Facebook pages relating to them - TG doesn't seem to have a live FB page but there are lots of others relating to it As for being sworn at, TGs ""Bot"" has already responded in Post 1414 and they are no doubt going to check what happened themselves (online TAs seem to record customer service telephone conversations) . Without hearing a recording of the conversations you are referring to, nobody reading your indignant post knows the rights or wrongs of who said what to who! TBH I personally find it very hard to believe that even if a call centre operative was very stressed with the conversation that the sort of language that you mention being used towards you would have come out of the blue. Those of us on here reading your post cannot have any chance of understanding what occurred . T me (assuming it has been quoted by you accurately) the final sentence that you mention - ""either you accept now or I hang up the phone"".- suggests that the person at the other end felt that they HAD covered all the points they could and needed you to get off the line in order to free it up to enable them to answer the next person - that particular phrase isn't in itself unreasonable in times when call centre staff are under huge pressure to handle as many calls as quickly as possible if any customer is being intransigent and refusing to end a call when further discussion is pointless. The standard instruction to call centre personnel in handling awkward customers seems to be that they should politely but firmly explain that further discussion is getting nobody anywhere and that if the caller doesn't end themselves the call will be terminated anyway . Your one sided account doesn't help anyone on this discussion forum understand what was said, whether what you were asking for was reasonable or not etc. etc .TG is unlikely to come back and publish their side of the conversationEdited: 6:33 am, March 25, 2020 "
I think the “bot” is becoming sentient
"Hello MenorcaRegular,The answer from TravelIngenio (above) was not satisfactory and not linked to what I am asking/warning other customers. I also do see messages in this review chat from others, explaining that the operators were rude, refused to provide explanation or propose solutions even when questions were simple or you are just asking where to find the info to double check policies.What I am saying here is the operators are potentially under staffed & under pressure but it doens't mean that such methods can be employed. If the client is asking to see where the policy is describing a certain condition/rule, as an operator you should tell them where to to find that info rather than pushing them to agree on the phone without any further explanation otherwise they hang up without warning...On a different note, I believe that the aim of this chat is to explain our experience with TravelIngenio thus any comment that could be helpful to future clients having the same issue is relevant. In this matter, your answer is no more relevant that mine I believe. Thus we should leave Tripadvisor community manager decide what messages are appropriate and should be or should not be relevant for this page. Thanks!"
"Posters here report posts they think are inappropriate. There's no ""TA Community Manager"" monitoring posts."
"Well Heidi you choose to buy from a dreadful company With complaints going back years. You want cheap tickets, on those tiny margins after sales support is minimum. In these unprecedented tomes, it simply cant cope.You frankly didn't pay for great servjce, so font expect it now.Yes their staff are overwhelmed. You can easily see what you signed up to by Googling their T&CsThe replies on here are by a not spewing out standard answersBy all means add a new warning to the thousands that already exist. They didnt stop you from choosing them, maybe it will stop one person but I doubt it"
"Heidi - even if you failed to read the T&Cs before booking (a big mistake) , as AmoMundo says you could have found them afterwards - in times of crisis like this there is absolutely no justification for you or anyone else to clog up a customer service line while someone goes through the fine details of the T&Cs with you - the info is out there and available at the click of a button to read online It was your booking and you signed up to paying the agent fees when you proceeded to give them your money . In case you still have not read the T&Cs , here is a link to them …travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and… . It took me under 30 seconds to find it via a google search!Edited: 8:40 am, March 25, 2020 "
"@ Travelgenio , it is very clear you are trying to get money from people and delay / avoid refunding money.your ways are not straight at allMy case: -When I requested to refund my money over phone they accepted and asked me to pay 30Euro , I agreed and paid the money , then customer service said after charging me "" It was a mistake and you have to request for cancellation and refund online ""!!!then they refund me 27 Euro?! may be bank charges?- After I made the request online, they said we can't refund but only provide you a voucher valid for one year after paying 30 Euro again!!!@ Skyscanner , not all the people are doing search for travel agents review before booking.I recommend if applicable to assure quality of these companies before they are advertising in SkyscannerOther wise you will lose business and some people will avoid buying via Skyscanner"
"Sorry, @loai_eng, but you are post 14 hundred something in a thread warning folks away from Travelgenio.Skyscanner is not responsible for bad companies advertising on their platform. If you saw an ad on Google for a product and it was no good would you blame google? Or don't you think you should do a little research, first. You've been a member here since 2013. This thread has been here since 2017, and there are DOZENS of other threads warning you not to use this company.You need to do research BEFORE you give away your hard earned money.1400 people have posted in this thread. More than twice that many have posted in the other threads yet Skyscanner and TravelGenio still exist. Your warnings here will be ignored by the next sucker. It's everyone for themselves in the world of internet sellers. You have to be your own advocate and do your research before you buy.Skim the threads. TG is contacting folks. I hope you get your money back, but bankruptcy wouldn't surprise me. If you used a credit card, initiate a chargeback before it is too late.Posting your complaint again and again in this thread isn't going to change anything either.

Refunds depend on airline authorisation and also ticket conditions. Any further details will be provided as a reply to our last mail. Regardss
"loai_eng - are your comments in Post 1422 meant to be a wind up ? I think that they must be because you surely cannot be serious when you say things like "" Skyscanner , not all the people are doing search for travel agents review before booking..."" and then go on to try and recommend that Skyscanner should carefully vet all the companies it allows to advertise on its site to ensure that they all comply with some sort of gold standard of transparency and are idiot proof .I am sorry, but any platform like Skyscanner cannot be held responsible for the people using it to access third party booking platforms being naïve enough to not pay attention to what they are doing ! You cannot legislate for people being so foolish in their pursuit of the ""cheap airfare"" that they are prepared to leap headlong into booking ""an amazing bargain"" without checking out who they are booking with and what the T&Cs they are signing up to say. At the end of the day , grown adults are all responsible for their own actions and financial decisions - Skyscanner is merely an advertising platform which although it will not knowingly deal with illegal operators (and like it or not companies like Travelgenio are not operating outside the law no matter how bad the reviews they get may be) but can only work on the basis that once grown adults click onto a website that they have found advertising on Skyscanner that they understand that the onus is upon them to ensure that they understand exactly what the product they are buying is etc. Skyscanners own ""terms of service"" page ( https://www.skyscanner.net/media/terms-of-service) makes this very clear if you care to read itEdited: 4:00 pm, March 25, 2020 "

I’m trying to get in contact with this agency.
"Good luck! There are many other threads full of posts from people who are trying to contact online agentsEdited: 8:35 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Hi Enzo, you can find in our next link all the info to get in touch with us and useful info for the actual situation. Regards…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
"some people keep questioning others"" why are you writing here ?"" and "" why are you not searching before booking?"" and "" why you are repeating the complaints ""....etc with long articles Writing complaints and points of view here give some information for other people.My advise if any one won't make search before booking so it is better to book directly via Airline & Hotels.That was my lesson which I learned from TGIF any issues on any posts, So Tripadvisor could remove ( it is their job)"
"Subject is "" Beware of Travelgenio on Skyscanner ""So all what expected people to write here is "" Travelgenio on Skyscanner "" !!"
"loai: Are you saying the 1400th comment here warning people will stop 1 person from using TG that 1399 comments wouldn't?We can only educate one person at a time. Among the 30 or more TG threads here are nearly 10,000 posts. We can only remind each new poster that they need to do research first so they don't make this mistake again. These new posts are not going to assist one single person who hasn't already fallen into the TG Cheap Ticket trap"
I booked with Travelgenio for a Singapore Airlines flight . I cannot return because of COVID-19 travel restriction and the ticket is open . I payed the service fee 30 euro so I assume it is waived ? . Impossible to contact by phone . When travel restrictions are lifted how do I rebook eg on the website and will the flight cost be automatically be waived before my debit card is charged ? Anyone rebooked yet ?
"Hi Randal, due to the actual situation, our reply times have increased. You can follow our current processes to rebook or start your waive process in the following link …travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
okay dear travelingo i have been calling you for more than 3 weeks Turkije cancelend our flight and You telling me that i could get my money or change the date of my ticket then you hang up and you are no longer available you cannot deal with people like that with your customers thanks to you this is a lot harder and we got still no money back!!!!
Chaima: Did you click the TG link above and read section 3?Calling is not the way to do this.
"To be blunt, Chaima, if you try and call them then you are just wasting your own time (and probably money).They are pretty bad when it comes to support normally. At this time it shouldn't be a surprise that they have more or less imploded."
"Chalma Sadly (a) you are talking to TripAdvisor members on this website - it is not part of Travelgenio(b) bandying emotive phrases like "" you cannot deal with people like that"" about will get you nowhere any quicker If you had not booked your flights through a 3rd party you would have been able to deal direct with the airline - as it is you chose not to do that, you chose to complicate matters to engage TG to act as your agent so you are going to have to deal with TG who (probably quite reasonably if you think about it for a moment ) seem to be prioritizing people whose flight dates are imminent over those whose flight dates have already been and gone. or who are not travelling for a while. Also, you do realise I hope that TravelGenio passed your money on to the airline - they do not have it ready and waiting to give back to you as they used it to buy the tickets that you asked them to so they will not give you anything until the airline has paid them the refund due for the flights they it has cancelled. Assuming that you have told TG that you want a refund not to reschedule, I hope that you have taken into account the fact that you will not get all the money back. When you booked through Travelgenio's website you agreed to their full terms and conditions which INCLUDED their admin fees for handling all refunds, cancellations and amendments on your behalf - this means that when any money DOES get back to them, they are legally entitled to deduct the fees that you signed up to paying and will only return the net amount to youEdited: 12:40 pm, April 14, 2020 "
Hello Chaima. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
i have already spoken to everyone but the problem is that travelingo does not record and we could not find a solution and I have already been told that the money is with travelingo and not with a 3rd if you were in my position with 2 small children in a country that is not your father or mother country I think you would write worse than me
"What a damn service you provided? I’ve inquired airline millions of times about my cancellation and refund, they mentioned that TRAVELGENIO should handle with this issue!!!I’ve posted my dealing experience with TRAVELGENIO onto local forum, to warn those who willing trade with TRAVELGENIO!!!JUST QUICKLY PROCESS MY CANCELLATION AND REFUND!!!!!!!!!!"
"If you've sent 'millions' of emails, then you've probably caused their email server to crash."
"Chaima: did you click the link I mentioned?David: you picked a bad company to deal with. When is your flight? TG will deal with you in time. They are overwhelmed, and you are going to have to wait"
"@ David (Post 1440) ""... I’ve inquired airline millions of times about my cancellation and refund, they mentioned that TRAVELGENIO should handle with this issue!!!..."" - that is the rub - YOU chose to use an third party to handle your trip arrangements therefore YOU are not the airlines customer, Travelgenio is because they bought the tickets!. TG will eventually receive the refund from the airline for processing , deduct their admin fees (as per the T&Cs you agreed to when booking so do not expect a full refund) and give you back whatever is left. .Bombarding them with extra calls isn't going to help much as they will be overwhelmed with calls from other customers in the same boat - the process could take some time. Next time if you are only booking flights not a package holiday deal directly with the airline!Edited: 4:20 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Hi Chaima, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
"David L, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. so, if you have already submitted an online support ticket, our agents will contact you asap due to the actual and current situation. Regards"
yes but you understand that we have been a long time and my flight date was already March 18 now is my money just gone I don't understand that it can be done just like that
sorry but i don't see a link
"""sorry but i don't see a link""---There's a link provided by Travelgenio in this thread, it's in the 1433rd reply."
"No Chaima, your money, due to the cancellation, has been asked to be refunded by airline. Once they approve it and manage it, we will receive it and, then, as a third party, we will be able to refund it. You can find the way to start your contact through the contact section of our site.ThanksEdited: 3:45 am, April 16, 2020 "
"I have just talked to Travelgenio and they asked me for the service charge of 30 Euro per ticket for the flight that was cancelled by Airlines, i talked to LATAM Airlines and they confirm the full refund, why i have to pay 30 EURO its not my fault and not my responsibility for flights cancellation. its a scam."
>>why i have to pay 30 EURO its not my fault<<It is not Travelgenio's fault either. You agreed to this fee when you asked this useless company to buy tickets for you.
"But i did not get the service, i did not use the ticket, i can fly and i need the same date and the same flight its not my decision to cancel the flight and ticket, travelgenio has to ask for their fees from the Airlines itself but not from the customer."
"Not your faultNot their faultBut you agreed to those terms when you jumped at a cheap fare. You agreed to pay those fees.The company did what you asked them to do, they bought tickets for you. They don’t work for free. They have to pay the people processing these refunds.30 Euro is a cheap lesson you have learned. Many people are out thousands of euros.Next time book direct and there will be no fees.Edited: 4:17 am, April 16, 2020 "
"Hi MSK-RUS, if you need to check the service fees for changes, cancellations management, etc. accepted and authorised in the booking process you can find them in the General Conditions section of our site. Regards"
what can i do to speed up the process
"Chaima: There are tens of thousands of people in your position.You can't ""jump the line"".You aren't special.They are refunding in order of flight date and when they get the money back from the airline."
"Hello please HELP - CRY FOR HELP HEREMy flight was cancelled by SAS and Wideroe from Oslo to Bodo, Bodo to Bergen, SAS inform flight canceledl due to COVID19. I try travelgenio website but can't get thru, I email them over 10 times, event their webiste not function , after input the flight number, its back to my email, weir. until today no one from travelgenio email or contact me, please assist me with full REFUND"
"Please see the previous post o yours. There's no magic wand that anyone can use to force Travelgenio to deal with you.Travelgenio, via their bot that posts here, have been clear that they are prioritising those who are due to travel imminently, though I believe even this is hit and miss because they are such an awful company."
"Travelgenio, Please ask for the fees from Airlines that cancelled the flight, I did not cancel it and I do not need any changes to my ticket. Thank you"
MSK: You have been heard in your other threads.Fees TG charges to you are only fees that you agreed to when you chose to use them to book your flights for you
"Lina Jasin, We are currently managing the requests for refunds of all affected tickets, so that as soon as the airline approves such refunds, the amount will be refunded to the form of payment provided when making the booking. We will continue to keep you informed of the progress of the refund process."
"You know what? You’re now losing loyalty clients rapidly, cause of we’re now booking with airline directly.If you want to prove you’re trustworthy, just resolve current problems solidly and quickly."
"Many years of complaints, David. Booking direct always is a good plan."
"I doubt they car about losing loyal clients. They know full well that there are plenty more folks who will use them without checking them out. It's human nature that a certain number of people will always book on the basis of advertised price and not think of anything else.And, to be honest, even if they did care I doubt they could do anything quickly in the current circumstances, because they are pretty poor at the best of times.Edited: 5:57 am, April 18, 2020 "
The cust.serv@travelgenio is not working . I am looking for a refund on TZPXOP .Singapore Airlines are accepting refunds now .
"Many years of complaints about this company, Randal. I hope you see your refund by summer, but I am not confident in that with this dreadful company"
"I agree with Post 1464 completely - once the dust has settled on the current crisis, even if TG isn't around ( which I think it will be) others like them will be out there attracting the careless or naïve with their advertising.. There will always be bargain hunters who focus on ""hook you in"" headline prices and nothing else. You cannot legislate for the foolish behaviour of those people and there will always be a fresh flow of them unfortunatelyEdited: 7:42 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Randal G, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
I am sending a lot of email and I am not able to get an answer! Is there a phone number that I can use? Or a valid email????
"1 e-mail is enough, Assunta. Skim the board, what info TG needs from you is repeated over and over and over and over again. Just go back a couple of pages."
"Hi Assunta, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"The worst experience I've had with a travel agency. I booked a flight for May 7th, which was cancelled since the Panama City airport closure has been extended due to COVID-19. I emailed them through their website and received a ticket number for the complaint. The phone is automated and unless your flight is ""upcoming"" (not sure what is considered upcoming?) it automatically hangs up so you can't speak with an agent. It's already been a week and I haven't heard from them. So not only do I not get to fly, it was impossible to speak with anyone, and it seems like they are keeping my money as well.... DON'T BOOK WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!Lesson learned: always book through the airline."
How did you formally involve skyscanner? I cannot get a reply from Travelgenio in any way?Thank you very much
It has been three weeks travelGenio since the airline cancelled my flight. No contact after over 50 calls and your machine hanging up and countless messages. I smell fraud
"'How did you formally involve skyscanner?' The only involvement between Skyscanner and Travelgenio is that the latter pay Skyscanner - a search engine, that's it - to advertise and be linked through the site.'It has been three weeks travelGenio since the airline cancelled my flight. No contact after over 50 calls and your machine hanging up and countless messages. I smell fraud'It's not fraud. Travelgenio has been a fairly useless operation since the inception of this thread and before that time, and these days their very basic customer service has deteriorated further.You've not provided any details of the flights you asked Travelgenio to book, but if the carrier cancelled the flights then you should be eligible to receive a voucher or refund depending on the carrier's rules at this time.Since you asked Travelgenio to buy the ticket they are the carrier's customer and you are Travelgenio's customer. You'll need to wait until Travelgenio get around to asking for a refund, and they will charge a fee to process that refund. TG have a bot which replies to threads on this forum and it may come by asking for more information."
"TP is right. Skyscanner is just an advertising site. Complaining about them is like complaining about google having an ad for a bad company or the newspaper classified ad turning out to be fake.TG tells their customers here they deal with customers with flights in the next three days only, so May customers have to wait. When your time comes you will get a nice note fromTG promising further contact, but no one here has reported receiving any contact.As you can tell from the age and size of this thread, you picked a terrible company to give your money to. I hope you get a refund, but I expect at best it will be a long time from now."
"Daniel B, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules (72 hours), but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"Tobias Billingham, We are currently managing the requests for refunds of all affected tickets, so that as soon as the airline approves such refunds, the amount will be refunded to the form of payment provided when making the booking. We will continue to keep you informed of the progress of the refund process."
Is there anyone out there who has actually spoken to TravelGenio or indeed got a refund? If there is I would like to hear from them.
They have 4 or 5 standard responses - worded identically - looks like a robot to me. The robots change their names occasionally - that's all I can see. This behaviour will surely just kill their company off.
"NO one ever comes back later and updates us, Kenny. You could be the first. It would be very helpful so we can set expectations for other travelers"
"Kenny M our agents are replying all queries sent through the contact section but, due to the amount of queries, the reply times have increased. Regards"
"I sent a request for information in a week ago (Ticket #3624705) for booking code 17914256 and haven't heard anything back. Now I can't access your customer service at all because it says ""trip cancelled"". What is going to happen with my flight and the payment? Any kind of response that isn't generic would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"You will get a generic response like everyone else. And you will be behind tens of thousands of other customers. This thread is nearly 1500 posts long and 3 years old for a reason, the company has bad customer service in normal times. Now? Good luck in seeing contact or money in the next few months.Not sure why you picked TG to give your money to. SO much bad news about them on the internet going back many years.You made your bed . . ."
"Daniel B, you will be contacted as soon as it is possible. Right now we are prioritizing flights in next 72 hours. Once our agents arrive to your mail you will get the reply. Due to the actual circumstances, our reply times have increased. Regards"
"Lesson learned: Never book again through a travel agent. Especially unreliable ones like this one, even if the price they offered was much lower, you end up paying more in additional fees and change costs, plus the hassle and stress dealing with them.Flight is cancelled due to Corona, I have been trying to contact them for the last few months to get an update. They were impossible to reach anyway. Now with this situation is 10x harder, and actually I am supposed to fly next week and I have no news and no way to get in touch with these guys to get a refund or change dates. I really regret booking with them. Worst experience ever."
"Tell your friends, Dimitris. The people here already know. Post on Facebook, tweet about it, tell everyone."
"Dimitris, I'm pleased you've learned a lesson, but it's a shame you had to do it the hard way. The easy way would have been to read up about Travelgenio here first. And I advise that you don't think of online ticket selling sites as travel agencies. To me there's a world of difference between a proper, full service, bricks and mortar travel agency and the likes of Travelgenio."
"Dimitris G, if you have already sent your querie through our contact section, you will receive a reply asap. We are prioritizing flights with departure in the following 72 hours. Regards"
"And actually, instead of using that resource to justify your bad performance by answering bad reviews online maybe it would have been better if you dealt with your customers requests first. So better get off here and go help others like me, I see we are many unfortunately."
"Yes, many people have used Travelgenio without realising how very poor they are.But most of us here believe that the responses on the forums come from a bot."
I have being trying to contact you but it is imposible please I need my refund you charged my money and did not book my flight with the airline. My book ID is 17784244 and my book reference is LD088Z
You are in a stronger position than most Sara as they didn't fulfill their side of the contract to buy you a ticket . That means that if you can provide your credit card provider with evidence of that fact and of all your abortive attempts to get TG to refund your money themselves you can just ask the card provider to reverse the transaction. Good luck
Great thanks so much for advice
"Sara, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. You can ask about it in customer.service@travelgenio.com Regards"
Why through the airline? If they said there is no flight booked to the booking reference you have gave Us. This is on you not the airline
"We, as a third party, have to follow airline policy and their terms. Thanks"
"Yes, but TG: You never booked a flight, you never forwarded Sara's money. You don't have to wait for an airline!"
"I don't get it, you never book my flight why have to wait for the airline??"
"'you charged my money and did not book my flight with the airline. My book ID is [redacted] and my book reference is [redacted]' Just to be clear, your credit card was charged and you were given the ID and reference numbers - is that right?'If they said there is no flight booked to the booking reference you have gave Us' Again for clarity, you checked the airline's website and there is no booking at that site. Is that correct?'I don't get it, you never book my flight why have to wait for the airline??' If your credit card has been charged and if you have confirmed at the airline's website that there is no booking then you shouldn't have to wait for the airline as Travelgenio never paid the airline for a ticket.The Travelgenio replies come from a bot, not a person. You could wait for Travelgenio to get around to refunding your money if the situation is as described above, but there may be a faster way.Contact your credit card issuer and tell them the Travelgenio transaction was not completed and you'd like to dispute the charge with the money returned to you."
"If you have received the ticket (with all the booking info) it is because it was booked. Otherwise, we cannot forward no booking info. Check the booking numbers in case you are providing the booking info of our system instead of the airline's one. As told, we wil be pleased to clarify what needed in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
Hi. I had 4 flights booked and paid for last East from Lisbon to New York via London through Travelgenio.The flights were cancelled and after many mails asking for a reschedule or voucher the flight company FINNAIR told me that there wasn't that possibility and Travelgenio was processing refund on the 06Arpil2020.Since then I couldn't contact Travelgeio by any means. Their site is so confusing and the do not answer any call or reply any mail.Can someone tell me some successful meaning of at least contact them?
"There was no ticket issued, TG. READ post 1492.I have tried to defend you since at least you reply to messages here, but it appears I was wrong to lend any support as you are ignoring the special circumstances here that are not COVID related and are not canceled flight related."
Sorry about any trouble I might cause. I do not understand How to start a subject.
Pomps: No need to start a new thread. If you bought tickets through TravelGenio you are in the same situation as tens of thousands of other people: Out of luck and out of your money.Two people have posted here that they got refunds. Thousands of others have posted that they can't even hear from the company. You made a bad choice when you picked TG. Next time buy direct from the airlines
"Hello Pamps;Information regarding covid-19…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…Best regards.Edited: 8:00 am, April 26, 2020 "
The Airline wrote to me that they have refunded for my tickets into a card number which is not mine. I believe it is of travelgenio and they are not responding to my emails or calls
dear travelgenio. i understand that you have enormous requests for cancelled flight refund but i need to contact you - my booking reference ZAUAOY. flight tel aviv -moscow - shanghai / how can i discuss with you the refund options or other options ?
Yes I 'm Still waiting for you to amwer my emailsRegards.

Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions, which you can follow"
hello we still do NOT get our money backyou have not responded or called us you can now really contact us or give our money back we have waait so many weeks I want to hear from you soon
Chaima:You aren't going to get a personal replyYou are unlikely to get your money back.I think you know this by now.The best thing you can do is tell everybody you know not to use this company or any of the other online travel agents who are ripping everyone off.
"Please cancel all of my bookings via Travelgenio.For those itineraries which canceled or schedule changed by airlines, please marked up I’m not willing to accept, kindly fully refund.For those itineraries which already canceled, please speed up refund."
"David: you know already you are at best talking to a bot, this isn’t TravelGenio.You made a mistake, you requested help months ago, it isn’t coming. Move on with your plans, learn from this mistake, and tell your friends not to make the same mistake you did."
"David L, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our specialised agents."
we got mails from Travelgenio a couple of months ago about the cancellation and refundation of our flights P6JVSC but nothing happened still now. We have bad feeling they are not going to solve the problem. Zhey are not responding and is seems sometimes they are completelly confused.MIroslav Erben
best travel genio I called Turkish airline and they said it's really weird that you don't answer and don't give back money because they have already agreed so could you please pick up the Phone or send our money back greeting E.f
"Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Hi,I am still trying to get a refund for a flight booked for the end of March. You sent an email stating that I had been a “no show” for my flight with emirates. I have contacted them and they have given me a certificate of cancellation. I want this refunding by the end of the week."
"And when they don’t give you that refund, Sam?Have you read the thread? Other than the canned reply from TG, above, no one is getting replies, nevermind money.You chose very poorly with this company. A 1500 post thread is a very bad sign"
"Thank you for your comment Sam. We would like one of our agents to study your case. So that they can do so, please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions, which you can follow"
If your not going to help stay out of it
Emirates details on purpose of the certificate - to give to your travel insurance company https:/…Are emirates issuing refunds or is it airline credit?
"There's your canned reply, Sam.You can't post on a Public Messageboard and not expect the public to answer. And when you make a declarative statement like you did, you kind of back yourself into a corner. Unless you have a solution in case you don't see your refund by the end of the week (Narrator: ""He didn't""), in which case it would be helpful to the thousands of other folks in your position to know what that is."
"We got info about cancellation of our flights 2 months ago. Tha agency claimed the procedure of refundation is going...but still now no response, no reaction. I am not sure if they exist....Miroslav Erben"
"You are right to wonder that, Miroslav. Under normal conditions they have terrible customer service, dealing with a few or even dozens of inquiries.Now they have tens of thousands of inconvenienced customers and they don't seem to be replying to anyone.The correct answer here is to research before you give away your money. We have been warning about this company for many years. Dispute with your credit card company if that is an option"
"Miroslav Erben, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents and get an update on your refund process."
"+1 to what N_T said. I don't know if you will get anywhere with this bunch, or when you will if I'm being too negative. Going to your card provider to see if they can help is a good idea."
"I thought I'd update people on here on what happened. I couldn't get through to them on the phone and I emailed them several times starting about a month ago. A real live person (not a bot yay!) finally got back to me today which is the day my flight was supposed to be. I'm not going to get a refund due to my airline's policy but they mentioned any changes should be done by calling my airline directly. Thankfully my airline is being flexible during the pandemic so they can change the flight free of charge up until December 31st, though who knows when I'll actually be able to fly (Panama is in lockdown) and I'm in a bit of a rush to get back home. I realize many people are not in the same boat because some airlines have stricter regulations. Best of luck to everyone, at least in my case they got back to me on the day of the flight so maybe you have to wait until then? However, best to avoid travelgenio if you want timely responses and they have some serious customer services issues."
Many thanks for your comments Daniel. We will pass your words on to our team. Regards
"Hi Daniel, could you please kindly provide some suggestions toTravelgenio customer service team if you were the CEO of Travelgenio? Thanks."
I am writing them every day for refundation of cancelled fligts. They promised me even on this side that the responsible persons is going to contact me. Nothing happened! They have never responded! It must be just a game!Miroslav Erben
Travelgenio reccomended me several times on this sites that if we contact their customerservice they will solve our problem...promised even concret person! Nothing has happenned still now! It seems it is only their game!Miroslav Erben
"That's correct, Miroslav.They have been a terrible company for at least the 4 years this thread has been here. They make tons of promises and rarely follow up.Anyone who does a tiny bit of research knows better than to book with them, unfortunately there are millions of folks who see a ""cheap fare"" and jump at that ""cheap fare"" and then get bit in the butt."
"Miroslav Erben, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Reply time has increased due to the amount of queries we are receiving. Cheers"
why is the problem to send me the contact of responsible person who is able to manage refundation procedure?....
"Because they have maybe 5 or 6 customer service reps and tens of thousands of customers all looking for help.When they were providing a bit of useful info they said they were helping customers in order of their flight dates and times. Not sure when you were supposed to be traveling, but I expect you will hear from them before the end of the year"
"The problem will be the incredible increase in requests and less staff due to Spanish lockdown. This is further compounded by some customers choosing to send multiple requests which doesn’t get them to the top of the pile, just makes the pile of working even bigger.You’re one of thousands, you’re just going to have to wait until they finally get to your case."
"well...but they are providing confusing info: first I got info about cancellation of the flights then later they claimed that flight is just madified! So, I do not know what is the actual situation.Nightmare...Miroslav Erben"
Welcome to the world of TravelGenio.The only way to win is not to play.
"Hi Miroslav, We have informed you how to contact us to register your petition. Once done, our agents will contact you asap. Due to the actual situation, reply times have increased. Thanks"
"Miroslav, have you tried checking the status of your flight on the actual airline’s website? That would at least tell you if it is cancelled or amended.Love TG’s latest post. Evidently their customers now need to “petition” for service. Wonder how many get their petition granted and actual help?"
"It looks as if petitioning for service only means you get placed in a very long queue. ""As soon as possible"" can cover an awful lot of possibilities. I don't know if TG are still only attempting to deal with those due to fly within 72 hours. If they are, that might only mean that they get a message back saying that their issue is being worked on."
"Dear Travelgenio Customer Service, 1.Thank you for your template e-mail. I think everybody gets the same from you.2.I think Travelgenio is a very correct company. Everybody in the groups on the links below, think that too. Congratulations!- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…- https://twitter.com/hashtag/travelgenio- https:/…www.travelgenio.com- https:/…is-travelgenio-scam.html- https://meanie.me/reviews/travelgenio-review…- https:/…In your previous answer, you did not mentioned any laws, or general terms conditions (accepted by me) to substantiate your opinion, about not managing my booking.Please check again the Iberia refund policy on the link below:https:/…Ultima_hora_CoronavirusPlease check the European Comission Recomendation, issued on 13.05.2020. on the link below (and also attached)„Reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket is due within 7 days following the passenger’s request in the cases of air, sea and inland waterways transport, 14 days after the offer has been made or the request has been received for bus and coach transport and 1 month after the request in the case of rail transport. Under the Union legislation, the reimbursement can be made in money or in the form of a voucher. However, reimbursement by means of a voucher is only possible if the passenger agrees.”:https:/…recommendation_vouchers_en.pdfhttps:/…c20201830_hu.pdfSo Iberia has to pay me back the price of the tickets, and Travelgenio as a travel agency must follow the laws and the European Comission’s Recomendation issued on 13.05.2020. (Attached) and manage my booking and refund me. And again: I would like to ask the full refund, regarding 6 (six) flight tickets from Madrid to Lima and back at 29/04/20 and at 09/05/20. Reservation code: RZPNVS/KCL2N. ( total amount: 17.836,34 RON )It is enough for me if you confirm to the bank that the chargeback process is justifiable / well - founded and I am entitled to the chargeback. (because you did not transferred back the refund, and you informed me with false / incorrect informations regarding the refund policy of Iberia.Thank you! Best regardsdr. Sebők Levente"
Again: I have got from TG mail the flights were cancelled!...and I will be contacted. It happened in March. Then silence. Suddenly mail - your flight schedule was updated!????I SIMPLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES IT MEAN!Miroslav Erben
"seboklevente, if we can be useful for you, please contact us through customer.service@travelgenio.com with the same mail account used during the booking process and writing the booking code in the subject in order to send you how to register any petition. Thanks"
Miroslav:You won't get any useful info here from TravelGenio. Just the same message over and over.Document your attempts to get a refundFile a dispute with your credit card companyDo so before TG totally runs out of money
yes...I wil do it. thanks
"A substandard company with third-class values. They are the new generation dacoits with no values. I have booked Emirates airline tickets with them from Singapore to Athens but because of Coronavirus situation, Emirates have cancelled the tickets. Now I have to run behind them to get back my money. They don't even respond to emails and phone calls. Emirates has refunded for all tickets but if booked via travel agent we have to contact travel agents to get back refund and TravelGenio is not refunding. Not just me there are many people like me who are desperately chasing TravelGenio to get back their money but TravelGenio is not responding. There is a Facebook group TravelGenio Victims, where so many people who are victims of Travel Genio. They don't even deserve 1 star. Request to everybody even if you get cheap tickets don't book via them better to pay little extra and buy from a good travel agent or directly from the airline."
"Subhrajyoti B, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"dear travekgenio, i wrote several mails, you answered me and provided false / incorrect information. It would be useful if you would give me total refund :) not sending me template e-mails :)"
"I have sent so many emails. They are of no use. You guys can respond here but you don't respond to emails. Refund my money soon, please."
Dispute this with your credit card company. They aren't going to get you personal information or money for a very long time.
....then it is necessarryto bring the action against them in court.....me
"Credit card chargeback is easier and quicker, but sure. Sue them. good luck!"
"Hi, We have informed you previously how to contact us to register your petition. Once done as you say, our agents will contact you as soon as the actual situation allows. Due to the actual amount of petitions, reply times have increased. Thanks"
"""increased"" could mean months. Could be years. Bot used to tell us ""within 3 days"" but that was weeks ago."
"Based on the evidence in this thread, it does seem like it takes months for TG to get around to contacting or refunding passengers. Is it any quicker by posting here? Who knows, but I suspect not."
Can someone from Travelgenio please assist me with cancelling a booking and getting a refund or possibly a voucher to redeem at a later stage when the COVID19 crisis is over? Finding it extremely difficult to make contact with Travelgenio. Been sending emails but no reply and the info on the website as to how to cancel a booking due to COVID 19 is very vague. My country does not allow air travel at the moment. I need to get this sorted please.
"Yolandri: Replied to you in other thread. Easy to find all these warnings about TG now, did you not search for warnings when you gave them your money?"
"Hi, no this was going to be my first time travelling and had no experience with this kind of stuff. I should have checked reviews before I booked with them but I did not think about it at the time. I was just looking for a good deal."
AlwaysDoResearchThe internet is an amazing marketplace but for every legit seller there are many crooks and shoddy companies out there.
"Thank you very much for contacting us Yolandri Du Preez. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Well, you are not obviouslythe only person. Everybody has problem with communication and solving problems with TG.HARD TO ADVISE!"
"Travelgenio, please stop scamming!!! I am yet to receive my refund for booking 57VJ54 (flight AI142) that I made 7 months back and the flight was cancelled. It is SHAMEFUL that you have not processed the refund yet even after exchanging several emails. Please update me and refund the ticket within next few days or else, a legal action might be too expensive for you. Zalak"
They won't contact you. Zolak. That's why this thread is so long.Dispute with your credit card. Tell your friends not to use them
"we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"There we go again. More rubbish implying that it's largely the airlines fault instead of admitting the truth that they don't have enough people working to process things in a timely manner and never will.Even more truthful would be to say that they don't care, as plenty of people will continue to use them no matter how abysmal they are. Legal action won't scare them. They must get threats like that every day.The nest steps should be that you pass this on to your card provider to sort out for you."
"I received an e-mail from travelgenio that in case my flight is cancelled due to Covid-19 you will request a refund from the airlines. I had never received any other e-mail after my flight was cancelled with any information that you will do so. I was trying to call you numerous times with no response. I sent an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com on which I received the following response: 'This is an automatic reply.We would like to inform you that we won’t manage any queries regarding bookings at this email address. If you want to contact us, please click on the “Contact us” tab on our website. In case your request is already being handled, you can write directly to the same email we sent you'. I clicked on 'Contact us' on your website and followed the steps and it only led me to information about my ticket which I already had., there was no way to contact you by clicking this button. When I was trying to call customer service telephone number sb picked it up and all that I could hear was dead silence. On your website, it is very difficult to find any information. I was also trying to contact my airlines directly, however, I received information that if my tickets were purchased by Travelgenio I need to contact you to receive my refund. Could you please tell me what e-mail address is working and what telephone number you respond?? Many thanks"
"Milo:Read this thread and the other 150 about this company.No one has gotten a refundNo one has gotten a personal email or phone callWe have been warning people to stay away from this company for many years. You can’t just give your money to strangers on the internet and do no research and expect a hoppy ending.You can file a dispute with your credit card company.You can wait for months and hope for a refund, but TG has given no reason to believe there will be any money or communication in the future,Edited: 3:05 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"Thank you Milo for your comment. To be able to receive assistance you should follow this procedure: Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive then a link to register your petition and instructions to contact one of our specialised agents."
"I have the same issue with Travelgenio, trying to get a refund for a cancelled flight during Covid-19. The website is purposely set up to avoid any contact from the passengers. I disputed it with my credit card, I guess they only respond to credit card disputes because they sent them their Terms and Conditions, and then my credit card denied my dispute! I'm never using Capital One again. PLEASE for everyone who has the same issue, file a complaint with the Department of Transportation (DOT). Any airline/travel agent will HAVE TO respond to DOT's inquiries. Especially DOT recently issued an enforcement notice that all airlines/websites have to issue a refund during this time. I just filed my complaint today, so fingers crossed even though it may take a few months."
"A complaint to DoT will have no effect. The DoT has authority over airlines that fly within or to the USA. It has no authority over travel agents, and can do absolutely nothing about a useless web site based in Spain.Do not waste your time contacting DoT."
"Also, even if DoT could force a refund (in this case, they can’t), the airline would be refunding their customers, of which you are not one. You are the customer of Travelgenio and they are the customer of the airline. You opted to place a shonky third party middleman between yourself and the airline when you could have booked direct. Now you will have to deal with those consequences. If you’re breaking your terms and conditions, what, may I ask, did you expect?"
"namie19, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase.We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"sydneynick is correct I'm afraid, Namie. Complaining to the US DOT about a useless ticket selling site based in Spain will achieve nothing. It's a waste of time and effort. Even if an enquiry was made then Travelgenio would just ignore it like they do with everything and everyone else.This is not the fault of Capital One either, sorry. The fact is that you decided to use a company who are useless at the best of times, and have all but disappeared in these bad times.Even now, they are trying to make out that the airline is to blame, while the reality is that if there are any refunds being processed from the airlines, then they are taking many months to reach the customer."
Hi Travelgenio. I'm wondering if your company closed down already as there is no reply for a couple of months even though i sent email a few times.

"Please don’t listen to the posts that say filing a complaint to DOT is useless, this is your money, do whatever is possible to get your money back. Tthose ppl’s posts who say its useless is bc they are useless themselves. I’ve booked with Travelgenio and it was fine if there are no issues with the flight, but once there is a small change with the schedule that’s when it becomes an issue. Update: I recorded a conversation with Emirates that Travelgenio requested a refund on June 4, 2020. So if I don’t receive the refund in 4 wks then I will have that evidence to dispute it again with Capial One.I have the same issue with Travelgenio, trying to get a refund for a cancelled flight during Covid-19.

""" Tthose [SIC] ppl’s posts who say its useless is bc they are useless themselves. I’ve booked with Travelgenio and it was fine if there are no issues with the flight, but once there is a small change with the schedule that’s when it becomes an issue.""---I'm not sure I understand your reference to others being useless. It appears to me that it is you who is stuck after choosing a poor third party to purchase your tickets - and I assume you didn't research first just opted for what appeared to be the cheapest fare?"
What jurisdiction does DoT have over a Spanish Ticket flogger?
"Thanks for the laughs, namie. “Any airline/travel agent will HAVE TO respond to DOT’s inquiries.” Lol, no they do not. A) Travelgenio is not a travel agent, but rather a ticket flogger. B) As noted above, the DoT has no authority over a Spanish company whatsoever. I do believe that airlines will refund their customers, with “their customers” being in the key phrase here. You are not the customer of Emirates or any other airlines. You are solely the customer of Travelgenio. Does Emirates have to give a full refund to Travelgenio? Absolutely. And I believe they will. Emirates will be just fine with the DoT if they do so. Now your agreement with your third party middleman has nothing to do with any of them. If you had booked directly with the airline then you would be receiving that full refund directly. Now that you put a shonky third party in the middle, you’ve got a whole different set of terms and conditions to deal with. It sounds like Capitol One was quite right to deny your chargeback if you are in breach of the terms and conditions that you claim you read, understood and agreed to before booking through Travelgenio. Why should you get to break your contract? The good news is you should eventually get some sort of refund. Eventually might mean months and obviously TG will deduct their fees that you agreed to from the refund, but you will get a piece of your refund. It will just take you a lot longer than if you had booked directly with the airline."
"Good luck with the DOT, namie. Even if it was true, the current administration has zero interest in consumer protection."
"Hello,I would like to cancel my both round-trip flight tickets (from below) and I was wondering if I can get my money back for both of them or offer me an alternative, because, as we all know, this is an exceptional global situation!!These are my booking references: 1.for the internal flight Bucharest-Timisoara, Timisoara-Bucharest J47AOA (May 2020)2. for the external flight Bucharest-Helsinki, Helsinki-Bucharest17466246 (August 2020)I have already written you a lot of e-mails and received no answer from you! Maybe the flight company didn't cancel the flights, but I wasn't able to travel, becayse due to this global situation everything was cancelled (meetings, residencies etc.). So this excuse wouldn't be appropriate!I am looking forward to receiving your answer very soon.Best,Ioana Palamar"

"Hello again,Yes, I have already written an e-mail to this e-mail address: customer.service@travelgenio.com and I received an automatic answer and this link:https:/…326 where I filled in again my refund request. I feel I am in a circle and I get no clear answer...Ioana Palamar"
">>I've waited for over a week now with no reply<<Some people have been waiting for well over 3 months. You might get a reply this year, if you are lucky."
"Lol they just need to sued. Then they might actually improve or, better yet, go under."
"Palamar, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"

">> they might actually improve or, better yet, go under. <<providing a good service costs money. Third party ticket floggers tend to attract customers that are looking for the cheapest price and gamble without any research. Providing a good service will result in them having higher operating costs so prices higher than many of the other shonky third parties that don't provide it, so those customers will just give their money to whoever is showing the cheapest price.When tempted by a third party advert it is worth spending 5 minutes on research to check them out before committing to a contract.Edited: 5:13 am, June 22, 2020 "
>>they just need to sued<<Best of luck with spending money on a lawyer to take legal action against an incompetent company in Spain.
"Ok, I am looking forward to your answer. I would be very happy if I can get my money back, because receiving a voucher is not the best option considering this uncertain situation... I would like to highlight the fact that even if the flight company doesn't cancel the flight, I am supposed to give up to my both planned journeys, not because of personal reasons, but because of Corona Virus situation; so everything is connected to this global situationj so is my right to get my money back and please I don't want to get such excuses that the company hasn't cancelled the flights and for this reason I can't get my money back! Is not fair! Thank you!"
"Palamar: You aren't going to get money back from TravelGenioYou aren't going to hear from them directly for months, if ever.This thread is 4 years old with 1600 complaints for a reason: you chose to give your money to an incompetent company.My suggestion in post 1597 works for you, too. If you don't want to wait until the end of the year, dispute this with your credit card company. And PLEASE do research in the future BEFORE you give your money to strangers on the internet"
">>so is my right to get my money back << Based on what legal grounds?>> Is not fair! << I agree with you Palamar, it isn't fair. It's not fair many people have lost jobs, have been ill, and lost loved ones. Unfortunately that is where we are today. As unpleasant as it is, you may not be entitled to a refund if your flight is still scheduled. If you'd booked directly with the airline you may be in a better position to get a refund/credit, but unfortunately you chose to buy through Travelgenio."
As a third party we will inform you to the registered petition according to the allowances and info provided by airline for your concrete case. Regards
the same problem . i am writing them every day and no answer and no reply / my flight was cancelled two month ago/ they still exist or not?
"Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Have you read this thread, Dani?We have over 100 threads about this company. They have been terrible for years. Not sure why you chose THEM to give your money to! You may get a refund thru them in many months time. Or skim the thread for other suggestions"
"2 months is nothing Dani - you need to seriously lower your expectations . A good starting point would be to find out from the airline IF they have refunded TG yet - until that happens you have no chance as they will not refund you and then wait to get the money back from the airline . Also, you do realise I hope that TG will charge you admin fees (per passenger not per booking) for processing your refund - you agreed to this when proceeding to book with them . On their websites things like ""once tickets or vouchers have been issued, any kind of modification or cancellation is subject to fees and additional charges"" appear without the exact fees charged being mentioned in the same section - you need to do some digging to find out how much it is going to cost youEdited: 12:52 pm, June 24, 2020 "
>>>they still exist or not?<<<They still exist. The bot that replies here is very active at the moment. Although there's not much evidence of anything else happening.
"Hello Eveyone, My name is Deepak Patkar staying in Singapore. I had booked my ticket from Singapore to Dubai in the month of March. But due to COVID-19 situation Emirates Cancelled all morning flights and scheduled at night. So having said that I emailed/called Travelgenio and they charged me 30 euros to change the flight timings. Was it my fault ? Absolutely no. I fought that why I have to pay, Emirates has cancelled and rescheduled but they never listen and I had no choice but to pay 30 euros. However, again all flights got cancelled. Now after months today I received email from Travelgenio saying if you want cancellations for your Dubai ticket then I have to pay 30 Euros or if you want to extend your ticket date then too you have to pay 30 Euros. Common guys are you crazy????? Are you taking the advance of this situation and making extra money from the customers. I would write a review about this Travelgenio everywhere and I will also share in every channel of communication. Let the people know about this scam agency Travelgenio. Please I would request you all not to book any tickets from this agent in near future. SCAM SCAM SCAM"
"Deepak, if you’d have booked direct with Emirates you’d have been changed to an alternate flight for free, and upon cancellation wouldn’t have been charged. As you chose to use a third party to book your flights for you, then you have agreed to their terms. There is nothing new in what this and other third parties do.  This thread is four years old and has over 1600 responses, so you’re not the first to fall foul and you won’t be the last."
"30 Euros is cheap for a third party fee. You appointed them to act on your behalf. You could have easily booked your ticket directly with the airline yourself. You didn’t. Travelgenio, as shoddy as they are, shouldn’t be made to work for free? If you hire a lawyer they will bill you for every little thing they do. Same with a third party middleman. You agreed to these fees in the terms and conditions. It’s not a scam."
"Deepak Patkar, here you can find the accepted terms and conditions with all the info regarding the service fees also. You accepted all them during the booking process. …travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and…"
"Scam, scam, scam, scam.No it's not. You just didn't read the terms of the contract before agree with it, did you, Deepak?"
"I booked a big flight through Travelgino and due to a flight cancelation, my first flight got changed, which meant that I was then unable to catch my next two flights. Travelgino wanted me to pay 600 euros to make a flight change even though it was because one of my flights got cancelled. When I called customer service, management REFUSED to talk to me! Please do not use this travel agency. Please know that even if they reply to all of the bad comments on here and say they want to look at your case, they don't actually give any type of solution to their problems."
"Yes, Travelgenio charges for all changes, no matter what the cause. It is in the T&C that you agreed to when you asked it to make a booking for you."
"Clim21, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"There is no point in posting more than once, or at all. There are already some 20,000 warnings about Travelgenio, so one more will have absolutely no effect."
"Clim21, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"The title of the post should have been ""Beware of Travelgenio on Skyscanner or Anywhere Else"".If people want to use a flight search engine, that is fine but using a link off the search engine to book a flight is NOT a smart idea at all.Use Skyscanner or Matrix for flight info but ALWAYS book directly with the airline and avoid those shoddy OTA's."
Matrix does not have links to anyone. It tells you the prices being offered by airlines.
"Reservation No. 3LVHSUTicket Information July 19th 8:52 AMPassenger Information Yechan KIM Why don't you reply or check my travel status even though I have asked for a refund and waited for a reply several times? I don't want the Corona virus to be an excuse for customer service quality. As soon as I paid, I confirmed that it was not a nonstop ticket and I requested a cancellation in less than 30 minutes. Please refund all the money including the commission as soon as possible. Such cases should not occur under any circumstances. I constantly asked you for cancellation and refund, and you didn't reply. I want you to act responsibly."
"Read the thread, Yechan. Nobody is getting a useful response from Travelgenio. When it eventually gets around to your case, it will deduct its fee from the refund."
The virus isn’t an excuse for their bad customer service. We have years of complaints showing their customer service has been dreadful all along.
"Agreed, I experienced recently , once they have your money , that's it! Couldn't careless what happened to you !I am still looking for how to claim my money back!"
"“ once they have your money , that's it! Couldn't careless what happened to you !”Well, yes. They are ticket floggers, not travel agents. Don’t expect them to behave like the latter. You went to a McDonald’s, but for some reason you’re expecting a fancy wine list and five star service. Yes, TG is completely shoddy, but in their defense, don’t ask them to be something they’re not/perform tasks smoothly that they’re not equipped to handle."
"Gong Gong, it's amazing that you manage to find Trip Advisor to post a complaint but you didn't think to research before you handed over your money to TG. Would you hand over money to a stranger in the street but you hand it over to an unknown on the internet.As said you wanted cheap but expect to have 5* service. If you are waiting or a refund then you won't get anything until the airline has refunded. That will be dependant upon TG even making the request. Once TG get the refund you will have to wait until they process it, then they take their fees so it could be many, many months.Suggest you do more research next time and book direct with the airline. I have received refunds from several airlines, the longest taking 5 weeks and of course as I'm in the UK I have the backup of a Section 75 claim through my CC. You loose much of this protection when you book through a 3rd party."
"Gong Gong, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"I booked my flight way back in Feb for 10th April 2020, due to corona it was cancelled. I lodged a complain about my refund, contacted them over their emails, contact number. Its July now more than 3 months I still have not received my refund. Customer service does not exist AT ALL, no body is picking up the phone."
Asad: Did you not see this 4 year old thread about TG with over 1500 posts in it when you made your booking?
"we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"I had purchased 2 tickets, as per booking reference-17686127. from Los Angles to Auckland. Flight date was 9 April. Due to covid-19 flight was cancelled by Hawaaian Airlines. So many times I have requested for refund money back but Travelgenio is not responding."
Did you try a charge back on your credit card?
"Good morning Iqbal S, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"You are right. TravelGenio is a fraud company. You can not believe in them, especially nowadays if you cancel the trip they do not even return the money. Even the customer care srvice is very bad."
"Prashant,If you cancel your trip why should they refund your money?"
"Prashant K,. Talking about refunds, we are constantly contacting airlines to be able to make them effective the sooner the best. Anyway, we must follow their procedures and this can take some months without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
I think that TG's latest message contains more lies than I've seen since Edreams gave up trying to convince us they cared.
"As I write I am calling TravelGenio trying to change my booking as they are not replying to my email for 10 days, so yes the airline chnage the flight but we pay your agency to handle the ticket and you should take care of cusomers intead of cheating them. BTW, this is minute 11 of international call and I am still waiting for someone to pickup the phone and of course nobady is there. So avoid TraveGenio, they are one big FAKE company and they will cheat you for sure."
Who are talking to? Them or us? They are not fake. They are rubbish as you being poster 1638 on this thread alone proves.
"Aleksandar Kovacevic, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"I bought tickets for 4 people to Tanzania. The flight times have changed so enormously, that I would miss my onward flight, and now have a 24 hour stop over. I would like a refund, which I believe I am entitled to have under the circumstances . I have contacted Travelgenio, but no reply. I now realise that Travelgenio is not ABTA protected, and is a terrible company. Has anyone had a similar experience, and what is the best way to get a full refund?"
"Frances: Please read the thread before you add to it. Thousands of people have had a similar experience, and there is no known way of contacting Travelgenio."
"Thank you Frances for your comment. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our specialised agents with the alternatives provided by the airline for the changes they made."
Same happened with me. This website is a scam
#1644'This website is a scam'And they get away with it because people like you pay out their money without researching first.
"Raghav Sarda, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Absolute snakes Robbery in broad day light Flight date March 9Flight booked March 4th Flight cancelled by Airline March 6th A represantativr called and said thta since the flight was cancelled by the airline company I'm entitled to either a full refund or another flight . Since therewas no fkight that matches my schedule Iwent for the full refund. Chased them for little shy of 6 months no one to speak with zero response to my dozen emails and countless phone calls.Just heard back from them : "" Please do not reply to this message, as it has been sent automatically.Dear client,In response to your request, we regret to inform you that, in accordance with the fare cancellation conditions established by the airline, your ticket is non-refundable.Best wishes-- Customer Care Team"""
"Thank you for your comment Tal. We would like one of our agents to study your case.

#1647'Robbery in broad day light'More likely by computer screen light.....
"Is it really robbery when there are 20,000 warnings right here to STAY AWAY!?!??I mean I guess it is, but you really need to pay attention to all the red flags when you are giving your money to strangers. A bit of research would have saved you big time"
"Out of interest, which airline were you travelling with Tai ? I am not aware that any airline has T&Cs that mean that if THEY cancel a flight they do not have to issue refunds or vouchers so TG may just be spinning you a tale. Have you actually contacted the airline itself to find out if THEY have refunded Travelgenio yet ? That might be a wise move at this stage because who knows, you may even find when checking with the airline that TG may not have actually had time to book the ticket at all before the airline cancelled the flight (you said that you only instructed TG to book it on 4th March and that the flight was cancelled on 6th March and I do not think that TG has live ticketing) If you get evidence that either TG never actually bought the ticket for you or that it was purchased but the airline has already refunded the money to TG then you would be in a good position to chase TG for a refund anyway !Edited: 5:33 am, August 19, 2020 "
"Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, book anything with TravelGenio! Please for your own interest use some other platform or the flight operator's website. I have been waiting for my refund for NINE months and I don't know what to do anymore. Chargeback is not possible after such a long time (I was stupid enough to believe them when they told be it would take 30-90 days to process my refund - the told me that TWICE). Now they say it will still take some time to process it. I'm just so angry and frustrated. My flight was cancelled way before corona times and now they use corona to delay the repayment even longer."
HT: you are telling us to not do what you did?But we would have to find this thread to do that. And if we found this thread without your post wouldn’t we already know not to use this company?
"If you can't go through your card provider then your options are limited. I'd just forget about it until, hopefully, one day the money appears."
"HT M, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"This travel agency is a scammer and dishonest people, I've had a situation with them this week. Customer service is liars and contradicting.Please if you will do any legal action against them I wanna participate."
"""Please if you will do any legal action against them I wanna participate.""---Lots threaten to start legal action, but few if any ever do. It would need to be you who starts any action if it's going to happen."
">Lots threaten to start legal action, but few if any ever...You are right, but as this is the first time for me to deal with this agency and once I checked I found many complaints against them. So, there may be a collective legal action here against them that has been undertaken."
"I bet you wish you checked before you gave them your money.We have over 21,000 posts here complaining about Travelgenio. You must do research before buying anything on the internet"
"#1658' So, there may be a collective legal action here against them'In your dreams.........they are legal.....just a bad choice to make!Edited: 6:59 am, August 24, 2020 "
"@ Post 1658 by Ahmed <<<..So, there may be a collective legal action here against them that has been undertaken..>>>Unfortunately not - there is no collective action that has been brought which has been referred to by anyone posting on this forum is aware . You are on your own with organising that I am afraid and as mentioned in Post 1660 - their activities are not illegal . you cannot sue for a company charging you service fees you agreed to when signing up to do business with them and if they get even a ehiff of you wanting to challenge their right to charge you before doing anything to reclaim any money from airlines etc they then do nothing and you are stuck!Edited: 7:37 am, August 24, 2020 "
"Ahmed Khalil, just because there are a lot of complaints doesn't mean that what they do is illegal, or that there is any kind of a legal case to answer.They are a terrible outfit that's for certain, one of the very worst out there in my view, but there's no chance of you winning a case against them unless you can prove that they have broken the law. Even then, if you don't go to court in the country that they are based, you may well find it very hard indeed to get a court judgement enforced."
