"we have been here since 2 mar and scheduled to return 9 mar. We have had an eerie experience-St. Peter's empty; no lines at ruins or museums (other than the Raffaelo special show). Two of our events were cancelled after we arrived-- a concert at Auditorium Parco on 5 mar and a group tour to tivoli scheduled for tomorrow. With schools and Universities closed---lots of kids out and about. Trastevere is full of college age kids who would otherwise be studying. No reservations needed at restaurants. Govt suggests no hand shaking;, keep a distance from fellow museum visitors. Sad to see the financial impact here as tourist dollars are a major part of the economy, but feel privileged to be able to see the sights in such an unusual circumstance. doing our best with hand washing and other safety steps; not looking forward to our upcoming airport experience and homecoming issues."
"Thanks for the update.I’m going in May, unless Italy won’t take flights from the US, since our outbreak is happening now."
Thank you for the report from the ground. Would you still make the same decision to go if you could choose again? I am currently struggling with this decision right now. Thanks.
"We are also in Rome now. Arrived March 2 and leaving tomorrow, March 8 for Siena and Florence. We would absolutely make the same decision if we could choose again. I am very sorry for all of the Italians whose livelihood depends on tourism. But this is the trip of a lifetime for us--to get to experience all of Rome without hoards of people. I counted fewer than 300 fellow tourists at the Colosseum two days ago; we walked up to the ticket window and bought tickets for the Vatican Museums yesterday. Today, we enjoyed the Borghese Gallery with only a few others. If you are debating whether to come, I say yes, you should!"
"The lack of crowds at such venues as the Vatican Museums, Colosseum, and Borghese Gallery, is certainly the most significant positive aspect of this crisis (from a purely selfish point of view), which is otherwise devastating Italy economically and putting many people out of work.Any tourist currently there or planning to go in the near future should take advantage of this unique opportunity, which hopefully won't be repeated in the future."
Some friends and I are also debating on either rebooking or cancelling our trip this March 31st. Flights and hotels are booked but friends and families are urging us to cancel the trip. Anyone had any experience of xenophobia as this is what I would be more worried about rather than the risk of ncov. Thank you
"Hello Badbatz. You are due to leave in more than 20 days, so you could wait anyway. The situation may change day be day and you could decide better at the last moment.As for xenophobia, I'm very sorry but it's the last thing I would worry about. Italy is certainly experiencing a crisis of the touristy sector and if you go you are likely to be much warmlier welcome than usual. Maybe at present Italians should be a bit more concerned to be rejected and discriminated if they go abroad..."
Maybe there should be a new word: coronaphobia.
"See this Al Jazeera description of the Italian public health system, history and stresses and response to crisis. Nearly 6,000 test positive for novel coronavirus as the southern European nation struggles to contain outbreak.https://aje.io/6ua44And see, from workplace perspective, the views of an anaesthiologisthttps:/…d95e652e-5fca-11ea-96d2-d1c7db9c0ec3Chrome browser will offer translation, in this case messy but you'll get the message. You can say not Rome but the whole system is stressed and the more people mill about as normal the greater the risks"
"Hard to say. Some may consider it reckless to have chanced it, but the Italin gov't-perhaps by overreacting has made more of an effort to bring attention to safety measures--the romans are saying to us--""we have a bad situation , but we are managing it well--you in the US will have it much worse. Politics aside, I guess the proof will be in the pudding. If we come back healthy and haven't contributed to the spread then yes I would do it again because I would feel that the deadliness of this disease may have been exaggerated."
"I originally booked a ticket to depart for Italy on March 13th for a week in Rome, Florence, Siena and Pisa. However I cancelled it because no matter how small that risk I think it is, if I do bring the virus back to my home country, I don't think I can live with that consequence. Therefore I decided to cancel."
As conditions change. We should act accordingly. Hard to predict and hard to trust our governments to communicate scientifically valid info.
"Flakcatcher2001What do you mean its hard to trust our goverments advice???? Beside the ridiculousness of our President calling it a “hoax” you can certainly trust The CDC and the WHO have the most updated information on this virus Covid 19- as well as checking the World News, travel sites such as these for updated closures, ect. This IS a Global issue that requires Global cooperation, and Scientists from around the world are working on a vaccine - exactly where else would you like to get your information from???On a side note, the Italian goverment has not in my opinion acted rashly in deciding to quarantine areas or shut down sites- they are working diligently to safeguard their citizens and tourists alikeEdited: 3:28 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Demi, I think flakcatcher aggres with you.Re-read the post.""Hard to predict and hard to trust our governments to communicate scientifically valid info.""I read it as, the scientists are factual and knowledgeable. The others are not (talking about the US)."
"Opie2747Perhaps I did,but thats how I perceived it- but they also said the Italian govt overreacted and seems to think that if they dont get sick themselves then the disease has been portrayed as deadly when its not- From the beginning- people were naysayers and saying that the media were overreacting, that people were overreacting, and lots of “ me, me, me” my trip , my money”... which is understandable- but like I keep repeating- its a Global Issue- that requires Global Cooperation- and travelling on a vacation is not really being sensitive to this issue as its travellers who are continuing to spread the disease. Politics aside, I do agree in this one instance with China that by totally shutting down Wuhan Province and not letting anyone in/out is helping to stop future person to person transmission.https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coron…https:/…faq.html"
"And just to be clear- the US Goverment funds and runs the CDCThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the leading national public health institute of the United States. The CDC is a United States federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia."
"You obviously aren't watching our president's takes which are in conflict with the CDC's science as were his actions in cutting agency budgets which leave us without any substantial ability to test for the virus.. In any event, we were disheartened to find no screening at EWR when we returned on Monday. At FCO, there was a questionnaire to complete at the departure gate. I understand the rationale for the extreme measures taken by the Italian government, but seeing how easy it was for us get back into the US, combined with the pseudo task force approach of the administration, I fear that the numbers of cases here will surpass the numbers in Italy in a week or two, not because of lack of scientific expertise but because of a failure of leadership to govern in the interest of the people."
