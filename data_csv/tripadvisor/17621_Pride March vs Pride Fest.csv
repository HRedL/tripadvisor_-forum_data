Hi. My son (14) and I are coming into the city and plan to attend NYC Pride. I have looked online to try to get info on the day... but in the end I can’t figure out if we are better off attending the “Fest” or the “March”— or is it possible to simply do both (that would be the ideal). Any insight/advice about attending the events?? Any thoughts or experiences so I can help manage expectations??He and I have done big marches in DC so I’m not worried about the crowd or anything like that. Just trying to best plan/prepare? Where/what best to go/stand/wear/be??And is “Fest” worth getting to or just stick to the March? Thanks
"I haven’t been to the fest, but watch at least part of the march most years. It’s upbeat and fun, lots of energy. I have small children and plan to bring them to watch a few minutes of the parade next month. I watch from 5th Avenue in Flatiron - between 14th and 26th Streets. I often have watched from Madison Square Park which is nice because there’s an announcer across from the park (in Worth Square) and the groups often stop there to perform. Enjoy!"
"The march is long, and at least to me, becomes repetitious with float after float of men in swimsuits dancing to loud music. The fests that I have seen are essentially street fairs with the usual items and a few gay things thrown in. During the parade, Fifth Ave. loses all of its shade. Both events seem to attract people under about 45 and in equal numbers of men and women. Formerly, the M/F ratio was more like 3/1."
"^^ I think this ratio must have changed more than a decade ago! :) The parade watchers are indeed equally male and female, and lots of straight people like myself. I agree that the parade is very long - probably ~8 hours. I’ve only watched it for 2-3 hours, sometimes breaking that into two different shifts!"
"There are many reasons why someone might not wish to continue watching the march, but the change I noted was during height of the AIDS epidemic and suspect the loss of 2/3 of the men was due to this.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Having done them apart and both together (in the past); I recommend doing them together!It offers more diversity. I agree the parade can get repetitive; but just when you decide to leave - the energy picks up again and/or something new happens. Then you end up being at the parade longer than anticipated. The energy and excitement of the parade is usually a build up for the evenings events. One major aspect (if you plan to do both events); plan your day accordingly. We usually do Dance on the Pier and the Muscle Bear Cruise; but to get from the East side to the West side is extremely problematic (due to street closures).Keep in mind that if you plan to watch the March and then attend the Fest; their will be loads of people doing the same thing you are doing. Easy to get separated from each other. So have a plan on where to meet up if this occurs. The gay pride in NYC has taken more of a circuit party route. You will have many events; just keep an eye on the age limits. As many will be adult oriented.Even the booths at the Fest may be on the ""eye opening"" side for those who think they have seen it all - or - (to put it lightly); memorable to many :)"
"Thanks for the advice.Info about Pride Fest is pretty sparse (or I am not looking in the right places). I am glad it is ""doable"" to attend both together.... so that will likely be the plan. I am guessing the parade first then the fest when we are tired of the parade.Any advice on where to watch from to maximize the ability to do both? I know someone mentioned Madison Square Park as a good viewing site - but does that make it harder to do both with street closures? We will be coming in from NJ via the Ferry... any thoughts on timing etc?Also-This will be the first time either of us attend - in terms of the booths etc. at the Fest - I don't sensor much for my kids - so I am not overly worried if stuff is a bit risque - he is 14 - and I am sure (whether I like it or not) he has seen stuff online.... but on the other hand, I don't want him to feel uncomfortable etc. He wants to attend this (it was his request) and I am glad he wants to attend with me- and I don't want to totally ""mom"" him the whole time - on the other hand, he is only 14 - and I want this to be a really positive fun experience for him overall.Anything I should look for (or avoid)???? Any suggestions?ThanksE-Edited: 2 years ago "
"Anything visible on the street will be fine for a 14 year old. If your son has seen an episode of Sex and the City, nothing he sees that day will be shocking."
"Check and see if any of the events mentioned above are restricted to drinking age adults.For any of the more well attended parades in NYC it can sometimes be difficult to cross the route, so strategize your viewing spot accordingly You might want to do a (guided or self-guided) walking tour around the West Village https:/…"
I think if you are coming from NJ you will be on the correct side for both the parade and the fest.
"So I had to look up Pride Fest, I've never heard of it. How's that possible?! The March is the big event, and as others mentioned, you can come and go as you please and it seems like you should be able to do both. Here's the map of the March route: https:/…2018MarchRouteMap.pdfPride Fest looks to be on University Place, between 13th St and Waverly. University Place is one avenue east of 5th Avenue, which is the longest stretch of the Pride March, so I would say to do both, you should make sure you are on the EAST side of 5th Avenue. During the March, it will be very hard to cross 5th avenue, you will only be allowed to cross at major cross streets.NYC peeps, am I reading this correctly; the March is going UP 5th Avenue this year? https://www.nycpride.org/events/the-march/"
"That's what it looks like, Suzie."
"I just saw where this will be happening while we are in NYC. We have plans to do the Statue of Liberty that Sunday morning and then explore lower Manhattan. We will be originating at the Millennium UN Plaza. Other than more people, I assume the parade and festivities do not affect the subways at all? It would just be the roads, correct?"
"Good catch, Suzie - the new route is interesting -- they'll go ""backwards"" and stop lower down (29th Street). William, yes, subways will be fine and outside of Greenwich Village/Flatiron/NoMad you'll probably not even know the parade is happening."
"I was in the city during the time of the march a few years back, really kind of stumbled onto it. I ended up standing in front of Lord and Taylors on the west side because it was in the shade, and being near the beginning of the route the marchers seemed more lively. As the shade shifted and the sun was bearing down, I called it quits after an hour or so."
"Hi! I'll be attending both the march and Pride with my 13 year old daughter. :) A couple things I'd note. 1) Did you see that there is a Youth Pride event on Saturday the 23rd? It's free to attend but you have to register for it on the NYC Pride website. It's an event just for LGBT kids and their families. Maybe we'll see you there! :) 2) If there are any VIP tickets left for Pride Fest, you might want to consider buying some. They were $40 but include food, special stage viewing area, special parade viewing area and... best of all in my opinion... dedicated bathrooms! Seemed like a good deal to me, so I snatched some up for us! 3) I know a few people above said how long the parade was in the past. I read that they reversed the route this year to help shorten it. It now ends in a part of town that has wider avenues, more mass transit options, etc. to help alleviate the bottleneck that slowed it down in previous years. It will probably still be quite long, but not the 8 hours witnessed in years past. I hope you and your son have a wonderful time!Edited: 2 years ago "
Thank for the information. Unfortunately the VIP tickets seem to be sold out or that would have been a great idea. I think our plan will be to start at the march somewhere on the east side of 5th and then head to the Fest when we are done with the parade. Have a great time!!!
