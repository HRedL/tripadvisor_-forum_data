"We head to Paris next week and I just realized the Paris Half Marathon will be happening on Sunday, March 1. We are staying in the Marais and our plans for that day are to visit the Bastille market and then spend the day exploring Ile de la Cite, Ile St. Louis and the Left Bank. The first 5 km of the race route will run by Place de la Bastille and along Rue St. Antoine/Rivoli/Quai des Celestins. Will we be able to cross over the race route in order to get to the islands and Left Bank, or should we totally avoid that area during the race? Thanks."
People are allowed to cross the street as soon as there are gaps in the runners.
"Thanks! Might be fun to watch for a bit, but wanted to plan an alternate route if needed."
I just heard the half marathon is cancelled anyway
Thanks for the update!
