"Just a quick heads up from August the 1st transiting through or be it that the UAE is ones final destination, which is basically DXB/Emirates and AUH/Etihad. One will need a negative Covid test undertaken a maximuim of 96 hours prior to departure.In the case of Etihad you have to use their testing partner Pure Health which will set one back circa £150, this is all fine and dandy. But they don't have facilities on all of thier network. So travel to and from some territories maybe challenging unless Etihad address it very quickly.As far as I can make out and I stand to be corrected, but Emirates are less pescriptive saying you have to use a UAE accredited lab. https:/…all-destinations-travel-guideshttps:/…"
"I have just recieved some feedback from Etihad re arranging a Cv19 test on a couple of items that required clarification:When applying for a Cv19 test via Pure Health and one is transiting AUH, one checks the visitor visa (VoA) button. If one is a national that does not have National Identity card/number, such as a UK citizen, one enters N/A and then proceeds with the application to arrange a test."
So add £300 for the tests if you are on a return journey. Then travel to a test station which could be miles from where you live. Yet another nail in the coffin for air travel
"Looking on the positive side, people who want to take risks flying should have to take a test beforehand, to prove they are not infected, and not transporting the virus to other countriesIt was air travel that spread the virus around the world so quickly to start withPretending everythings back to normal now is not the way forwardEdited: 12:46 pm, August 01, 2020 "
">>> Looking on the positive side, people who want to take risks flying should have to take a test beforehand, to prove they are not infected, and not transporting the virus to other countries <<<=======It does no even do that as it is a point in time test, it means one was Cv19 free on the date time tested, nothing more nothing less.Personally I would have no qualms flying if I had something booked as there are far more risky elements to every day life in the UK, However, where I would like to travel to has a moritoruim on foriegn nationals entering the country, therefore I'm happy to wait until such time that changes."
"EY have now changed their guidance and those pax *transferring* through AUH do not need a CV19 test carried out by Pure Health, but can use any Government accredited lab:""COVID-19 PCR test if you’re transferring through Abu DhabiYou may arrange a COVID-19 PCR test with any government accredited medical facility a maximum of 96 hours before your arrival time in Abu Dhabi. You must present your result for validation at check-in.If your test is positive, or you are unable to present proof of your negative COVID-19 PCR test, you will not be permitted to travel.""https:/…multi-step-form-wrapperhttps://www.thenational.ae/uae/transport/cor…"
"The fun fact is that if your flight starts in Dubai, you only need a Covid-19 test for specific countries."
