Has anyone experienced any theft from the safe in their room at the Riu? Can I trust that my belongings will safe in there??
"There was a very long thread of posts about thefts at the RIU. Use the Trip Advisor search function and you will find it. Yes, there have been problems but no one has reported anything recently."
There did seem to be a spate of 'thefts' in Dec 09. But since then no mention of theft - It worried me enough that I nearly cancelled my holidays - but looking at the reviews since it seems to have really sorted itself out. You shouldn't really need to take a lot of cash as it an all inclusive resort.It would seem that passports were not a target at all - maybe take a lockable bag to go in the safe - or lock your case with things in
Most recent review mentions theft from the safe- maybe the thieves are feeling safe enough to start up again!
www.insuremytrip.comuse the hotel safe for valuables not room safeyou should be fine...
I have not seen any bad reports about more thefts there...I drove some people there and ask them later and they toll me everything was OK and safe!I think the epidemic of thefts are gone!roadadvisor
I saw the one recent post about an IPOD being stolen from the safe. My bet is that the kid lost the IPOD and just claimed it was stolen. I spoke to people there and not one person had anything stolen or had spoken to anyone that had.
Has anyone asked what happened to the mangroves?
Ouch!
Why have they been stolen too?????
That's the word on the street....I mean beach.
