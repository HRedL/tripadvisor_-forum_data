I gotta tell you all...love this site. You all make me relive my trips...and look forward to my next trips...
"ME TOO!!!!!!!!! Since I returned I am so sad. I want to plan my trip back and have been watching as all of the fares creep up from Dallas. I love reading all of everyone's favorite restaurants, memories, snorkeling and diving adventures, and about the east side. I want to thank everyone out there for making our vacation so memorable. I knew just where to go and how to get there! I especially loved when I met Betsyinczm, Pancho's wife, and BeachRN. Who would expect to get to know such great people through a trip forum and then actually meet them in Cozumel? Love it!"
"I've been here since almost the beginning days of this forum. How bad do you think I have it? ""Cozumel is a state of mind"" and luckily it is very hard to remove from the mind. "
My trip is still 2 months away. I check this forum almost every day. It gets me through another day of work. I love seeing the pictures from everyones vacation and hearing about all the great places to visit. I have learned so much.
"i agree. ever since i ghot back from my trip last june, i've been a cozumel info junkie. going again end of may. look forward to checking this site everyday at work."
"Is there a class for our addiction (perhaps CFAA)? Not to rub it in, but I'm heading there this Saturday for two weeks, staying at the Grand...any suggestions?"
"My addiction to CZM started back in 1979 my first visit to the island. I had it so bad by 1980 I moved there and stayed till about 1987. I still dream I am in CZM and supposed to be leaving for the airport to come back to the states but never seem to find my way back.I miss it terribly.But not sure I could live on an island again, just something I feel but it sure was an amazing and wonderful experience.I still come back for visits, see some old friends and such."
"I need a fix, BAD!"
I know what you mean... I have been there once and it is only 126 hours and 23 min until I start my trek back. I spend more time reading these forms than I do most anything else. I have not posted in here yet but wanted to thank you for all the info and advice. Cyber---
"I'm not addicted - I can quit anytime I want.....I just don't want to! Ha Ha! Hopefully nobody is planning an intervention for me..........seriously how can anyone not love Coz and the wonderful, generous people on the island? It is like finding a piece of heaven...............can't wait to go back...."
"lol, the above posts are funny as hell, i can so relate, i planned my trip to coz about a month ago and have been checking the forums several times a day since then, starting to question myself as to why so often. I always want to see the best things and do the best activities on every vacation. this site gives you that extra heads start... "
Hey I gotta say I agree with you all Cozumel rocks. Has anyone else done any of the cool tours they have there? I mean I loved it there but you get me on an atv again and rompin through the jungle and I am really in paradise. I am already planning my next trip. tripadvisor.com/GoListDetail-i15902-Here_andâ€¦
"I am really pathetic. I don't have any trips planned(we went in Nov) but I still check in with this forum daily(sometimes more). I have fun reading about other people's vacation experiences while trying to plan another one. My husband always says ""you're not on THAT site again are you?"" He wouldn't understand, it's a TA thing."
"Well now, I have to join in...I confess I'm a Cozaholic big time. This summer will be 14 years!It all actually started in Cancun when it was still very small, around 1979. For any of you that never went before it got huge, it was wonderful, very tropical ""feeling"" and somewhat quaint.OK I'm old, let's say above 35 and lower than 100 yrs old. ha-haAfter Cancun got so huge and I got my PADI I started going to Coz and sometimes go back 2-3 times a yr. Still not as often as ""mslf"" and some of the other guys!I love that place so much! and the people there are genuine and I love them. I know I've told many stories about the old days, so I won't again, but just had to say ""hello"" to all you Cozaholic TA'ers out there! And, you guys that say you don't want to rub it in, but you're going soon....bah humbug to you! We're not going until last of April, better deals then right after Spring Break.Adios amigos!"
"Well, I too am on here way too much, which I dont think is a bad thing! 2 or 3X a day, just dont tell the boss!  Coloradoman, we will be at teh Grand coming this friday for one week! Can not Wait! Will try and keep an eye out for you. I will have a giant Bubba with me, 52oz, yowsers!"
"I got it bad....When the stock market goes up I try to guess how many days fewer days I have to work until I retire. When it goes down, just the opposite.We go there a lot and every time we just get more addicted to going. Several times we've talked about chucking it all and moving down."
ditto what MSLF500 just said.. exactly....
"Yep, us too. About 9 yrs ago, we actually, checked into moving there and even looked at boats. Then my husband's health got too bad to move anywhere that didn't have specialists and a super good hospital. He's not even supposed to travel, but he does. He's even mentioned recently that we might try to stay a few months out of the year....I think that was wishful thinking. See, that's what Cozumel does to people...just chuck everything and take off!"
"30 days and counting down!!! Been to the Caribbean quite a few times, but Cozumel keeps calling us back time and time again!"
"As old as the original thread was, this is a timeless post. The 'Forum Addiction' is obviously an epidemic! LOL! I check in as much as I can for my 'fix!'-Tom"
I too am addicted to reading all the posts. I do not always write in but I sure do read a lot!!**4 more weeks for us and we will be in CZM!*!*!
"This post rings so true for a lot of people it seems . The past few weeks I've been drawn to the board myself . Made 2 Trips to Cozumel last year have 1 trip planned for this year .. We'll see if it turns into more. Most of the people on this board are great with telling thier experiences and sharing info . This is a really friendly forum , kind of reminds me of cozumel itself . "
My log in name says it all!We've been going to Coz every year (some years two or three times) since 1991.Any extra $$$ is squirreled away for the next visit.Spare room is the Coz room with a suitcase or bag waiting for stuff to be added.Hubby has instructions to throw me to the wind on the eastside when the time comes. He asked if he could have his new girl there when he does it and I said no she can't be on my island. He sheepishly stated she would be waiting just offshore in a boat!That's fine.....I just hope the wind is blowing the right way!Cozoholic (there in 13)
