Hi my daughter and 3 friends looking to rent next week. The only places I've seen so far that rent to under 21 are $200 plus a night. Girls are looking for a place with a pool in a safe area where the can either catch the free trolley to the beach or a cheap Uber ride. Looking to stay under$125 night. Any suggestions? Thanks
You are not going to find anything for $125.00 a night at any age. This is high season and spring break. I would grab the $200.00 before it is gone.
My son just got to Ft. Lauderdale today. Your daughter should know that Miami beach started to mandate a 5pm curfew on the beach starting today. They are trying to minimize large groups of spring breakers congregating. There is talk of other beach towns doing the same soon. They literally just pulled in to town and said they were hearing from people about that happening at Ft. Lauderdale. Who knows what it will be like by the end of the week. Each day something new.
"Why are people coming here? Selfish and thoughtless. Apparently our officials need to take action and shut down spring break and tourism to have effective containment while locals deal with closed schools, parks, remote work, and grocery store shortages. Maybe they will be the source of community spread back to their hometowns and grandparents. If your kid gets sick here and needs a test, this just out for Broward County (Fort Lauderdale)The Florida National Guard has called up all of it's medical professionals to form Task Force - supporting the @HealthyFla Florida Department of Health (DOH) in Broward County. #COVID19"
"Why are people coming here? Because normally it’s a pretty good tourist destination and a busy cruise port. Is a “don’t come, we don’t want you because you’re selfish and thoughtless” attitude going to be good for tourism in the future? I don’t know. Perhaps the US government needs to issue a ban on travel within the US, then it’s the law and not personal opinions."
"It’s not normal times. Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale closing beaches, limiting hours at restaurants due to COVID-19 outbreakhttps://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/03/1…"
Don't worry it's cancelled. We ( her parents) were down here already because we came before everything went downhill. If you want to blame spread it around. The airlines are selling tickets for $52 ROUND trip to Miami and FLL. That alone will bring the kids. After they closed the beaches I told her to tell all her college friends don't come the beach and clubs are closed. End of story. Stay healthy everyone. We are heading back north tomorrow where our governor has already closed restaurants bars schools libraries etc...
