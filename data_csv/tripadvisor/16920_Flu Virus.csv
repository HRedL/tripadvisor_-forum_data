Hi! Who has heard on the news about the virus to watch out for in Mexico? Do you have more information? Should we be concerned? 
What virus would that be?? I guess my thought is when traveling anywhere is to wash your hands frequently - using antibacterial wipes/spray/gel often - especially before eating and not worry overly much - we can pick up things anywhere. :)
 Read this...travel advisory.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/04/23/respiratory-i…
The same flu/cold is moving through the US and Canada-got it while I was there for 10 days-they had it before I got there !! arrghhhh
"The article says, ""We are not sure where this is in Mexico, but it's not the tourist area,"" said Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. ""Another part mentions Mexico City.So this has nothing to do with Isla Mujeres or Cancun."
"This was posted on the Cancun forum earlier by my friend Jim in CancunPosted on: 3:59 pm, today Save Was just listening about this on the local news.1.- Cancun is not in either south or central Mexico. 2.- The disease has been detected in Oaxaca, San Luis Potosi and Mexico City. 3.- There has not been a case of influenza in the State of Quintana Roo in 30 years.4.- I am not suggesting that people should not take precautions just that they not let the precautions take them."
"I live in the Dallas area and there is a story about this in our news today.... here is the ironic thing about the story: they are saying that its the US citizens traveling to Mexico that are causing the problem.... we are bringing it to Mexico when WE travel there (not the other way around). and, by the way, the main problem area is Mexico City - they are saying to make sure and get a flu shot before traveling there just to be safe!"
"on a side note about US citizens bringing the flu to Mexico.... i am questioning the validity of the statement about it from my local news (whether that was really correct or not) because i dont see any statement that resembles that in any other news stories..... (plus, they are thinking that its not the same flu strain - one is US is different than one in Mexico...) just wanted to clarify...."
"update: the news story is changing so often (keeps getting updated) that i dont know what to believe now.... (now they are suggesting that the strain is the same..... same one here is same one in Mexico) but the ones here hadnt had any contact with pigs, but they are saying that it CAN be spread from person to person (and alot of mexico city citizens are informed to not shake hands, kiss or share utensils - are alot are wearing face masks now and have cancelled school) Best bet is be up to date on vaccines and wash hands frequently! ...oh, and watch the news for important info on it (be informed). :-)"
"I was in Cancun for a week in the middle of February. Crazy thing is i got really sick with a bad respiratory (as in the articles) infection mid March. I seldon go to the doctor but this infection was ""killing me""??!! so he put me on antibiotics. It cleared up but i still have a funny cough. Again I'm seldon sick and cant remember the last time i was on antibiotics. Coincidence? who knows but this article scared me. The other thing it stated is that young men were dying. I can only figure that men won't go to the Dr. just my opinion.The moral to the story is dont second guess.. or think you'll get better on your own get to the Dr.!!Good luck all and happy/healthy travels ;o)"
"There are a lot of cases of influenza in the area - I am in Merida, which is near Cancun and therefore the Mayan Riviera - and the IMSS has not put out a warning because they do not have enough vaccines on hand. The current This info from a doctor who is in the know. If you can get a vaccination, either at home or here, get one. "
"""There are a lot of cases of influenza in the area...""Bill, are you referring to Merida area?"
"Affirmative - and reading up on the subject, this is happening in other places as well, such as Mexico City."
"Yes, they made it seem like it's mostly contained in Mexico City but if it's also around Merida then obviously that's not the case. Kind of disconcerting, to say the least."
Nothing like a little influenza epidemic to add to our already mesmerizingly depressing situation...
My wife and I both got sick in January during a trip to Playa with very similar symptoms. I had a cough for 6 weeks. After 2 antibiotics it was taken care of. My wife was sick after the 1st day which leads me to believe we had the infection before we left. It was a bad infection but being sick in Mexico beats being sick in Wisconsin. 
"But if it's the flu, that's viral. Antibiotics should not have any effect. Or at least that's how I understand it."
"This seems to be a totally new outbreak that started mid-March in the Mexico City area. There are NO reported cases in the tourist areas as of now.This is swine flu, not your normal influenza. There have been 16 confirmed deaths in the Mexico City area from the Swine Flu. And now there have been cases reported in the southern US (in southern TX and CA), and some in Canada from travelers returning from the Mexico City area. No deaths in the US or Canada from this yet. They think about 900 may be infected, and up to 60 deaths may be attributable to Swine Flu, but not confirmed yet (only 16 confirmed).From WHO:""In Mexico, other influenza viruses are circulating there, so sorting out which cases are caused by swine flu, which are other viruses and which are co-infections will be very important public health information. We have prepared rapid containment measures in case they are needed."" WHO and the CDC said that there was no need at this point to issue travel advisories for parts of Mexico or the US. A statement from WHO:""We are not at the point - WHO is not at the point - of declaring a pandemic; we are at the point of trying to learn more about this virus, understand its transmission, and how to control it."" The CDC also plans to send experts to Mexico to help investigate the virus. Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs. It does not normally infect humans, although sporadic cases do occur usually in people who have had close contact with pigs. There have been rare documented cases of humans passing the infection to other humans. Such cases are monitored very closely because of fears that a new strain of swine flu with the ability to pass from person to person could spark a pandemic. But this is NOT a pandemic at this point."
