"I’m working on the premise that our family holiday toCorfu is happening. By August the planes will be flying (or bankrupt) and the resorts will be open. I’d imagine there will be far fewer people and the beaches/restaurants will be oddly sparse due to social distancing.We love Corfu and we go most years, I know it’ll be different, we’ll just have to make the best of it we can. Some questions: should the worse happen and we pick up the dreaded C-19 whilst in Corfu and take a bad turn, what’s the hospital/medical situation like?Secondly - would travel insurance cover this scenario?Thirdly - what fo the local’s think about the forthcoming season? I don’t really want to somewhere where we’re not wanted, if we’re regarded as a burden or (worse still) a danger to the local population then there’s no point going."
"To answer your first question - are you in a high risk group so that if you had something like SARS-Cov-2 you were a high probability of needing to be put on a ventilator or at the very least need some sort of CPAP device? Before Greece allows anyone from the UK to visit the islands they will be fairly confident they have contained the virus. If you needed hospital treatment then you'd need to be in an ICU unit and there are only a small number on Corfu in the main hospital.... which is why they are in lockdown.For question 2, you'd need to ask your insurance company what it covers but if you were taken ill then at the moment our EHIC cards and the reciprocal health agreement would cover you for any treatment. But if you needed an ICU bed and there wasn't one available then you'd have a problem treatment wise. Holiday insurance isn't going to be able to magic up an ICU bed.I'm not a local so can't answer your third question. But if the Greek's don't want us to visit they will make sure we don't. It isn't the decision of the UK tour operators and airlines whether they can fly anyone to Corfu. It might be by August we are not allowed to return yet.And following on from there being a chance you would not be able to travel there, if this is a holiday yet to be booked then holiday insurance would not cover you for SARS-Cov-2 being the cause of cancellation."
"Excellent response. I’m not in a high risk group and nobody from our family would be. I’m nervous about relying on travel insurance as they’ve wheedled their way out of covering my business interruption and I’ve lost faith somewhat in their service. Does anyone know what the ICU situation is in Corfu? Does it have capacity for a potentially busy summer? Really these are ridiculous questions. The chances of an ICU bed being required by a member of my family is statistically very low. However, we’re living in ridiculous times and I feel these are questions a lot of people may be asking as they assess the risk and reward of a summer 2020 trip to Corfu."
"I notice all your questions are from the point of view of what happens to you. Given that Greece has largely controlled covid as of now, and your and my country have not, why aren’t you at all concerned about contaminating the locals?Low risk means you’re less likely to die. But you easily can be a carrier and sicken others."
"Of course that’s a consideration and perhaps I should have made that clearer in the initial post. If there’s a risk to the locals, if they don’t have the resources to manage a spike in new cases, if it’s going to bring stress and worry then we won’t go."
I love Corfu go every year but won’t be this year Greece locked down very early as they no they haven’t got the room in there hospitals or the equipment to cope with there own why would we put that pressure on them so please think hard about your choice of holiday this year remember any one can get this Coronavirus stay safe
"1). The hospital treating Covid-19 for Corfu is in Igoumentisa which is an air lift or ferry ride away. 2). Check your insurance policy assuming you had taken it out before the pandemic to make sure you have cover. Going forward I don’t think there is any cover? Certainly, my insurers have amended their policy for holidays booked after the pandemic announcement. Also, bear in mind, that if you were to develop symptoms on the island it is likely you have brought it with you and not contracted it there. So, you may have infected people on the plane. Incubation period for symptoms is around 14 days. 3). If the Greek government gives the all-clear to tourists; it gives the all-clear. I don’t think anyone can guess/judge on individual responses. Personally and from what the Greek government has intimated, I think it highly unlikely the UK would be allowed onto the islands in August; possibly the end of August? Bottom line, no one has a crystal ball, none of us know at this point. Too many variables to make a guess."
"No small Greek island hospital has ICU capacity for an outbreak of Covid 19. I think the Greek authorities will have to decide if they would want to take a chance on the UK holiday crowd. August definitely not a certainty at this point...just a waiting game.Edited: 10:43 am, April 20, 2020 "
">> If there’s a risk to the locals, if they don’t have the >> resources to manage a spike in new cases, if it’s>> going to bring stress and worry then we won’t go.They do not have the resources for this which is why you aren't going. Stay safe Greece. The island of Corfu maybe has half a dozen ICU beds. Even if it was 100.... no tourists can go yet"
"“Secondly - would travel insurance cover this scenario?”Unlikely. Many policies in place BEFORE the pandemic already excluded pandemics, and even some “5 star rated” policies excluded cancellation based on FCO advice - so even if the FCO said you shouldn’t go somewhere due to riot, volcanoes or a pandemic, you wouldn’t have been covered. And now? Loads of companies have pulled out of the travel insurance market so there are less policies available. And those that do exist more than likely exclude anything to do with this pandemic or future ones."
"That said, if the travel insurance industry doesn’t cover C-19 then it’s value becomes worthless. As an industry it’ll vanish as it’s not able to offer security against the one potential threat people currently care about. I suspect they will be forced to offer cover or see the entire travel industry collapse due to the general public being unprepared to take the risk of travelling anywhere."
"Hello from Corfu and happy May Day,1) In the hospital of Corfu if you need ICU they send you immediately in Ioannina which is the closest biggest city to the island,that's what they are doing even know if they have a positive C-19 situation.The hospital there is ready and it's one of the best in the country.2) I think you have to be very specific with your Insurance company. What you have to ask is if they cover the Covid-19 to a PUBLIC HOSPITAL of Greece and what you should do. It's a pandemic and I don't know if they will be able to cover you.3) I am a local and I am working to the tourism industry owning a travel & transportation agency and I can assure you that the whole island(and i suppose the whole country) is waiting for the new protocols about tourism. Most of the locals live from tourism industry and we have already lost half of the season so we are waiting for tourists like never before BUT we are still dont know the permissions which will be announced in the next 10-15 days.I hope I helped :)Stay safe,Chris"
"Thank you, Chris. Your help is of great value. We are eager to visit Corfu like never before :-)But... Safety first..."
