You have already seen this thread: https:/…105610429You plan is doable but drive from the airport to Peggy's Cove and then to wherever you are staying in Halifax.
Thanks! Appreciate the prompt response :) any suggestions for renting cars? Airport or in the city? I’ll play it by ear depending on which area is like more since I’m travelling solo. Do you think i should get hotels/motels from before or do you think it would be easy to find a place to stay last minute? Thinking of a trip September long weekend so uneasy about not finding a place to stay last minute.Anika
"Hi Maryann,Where do you recommend I stay in for the three nights in baddeck+cabot trail?Should I stay one night in Baddeck, One night in Ingonish and One night in Cheticamp?Thanks!Anika"
"Rent the car from the airport to save time (not money) and visit Peggy's Cove. Consider staying in Bayer's lake or Bedford area for the night to get an earlier start the next day. This would mean skipping Halifax so that is a consideration.In Cape Breton it depends upon what activities you wish. Perhaps two nights in Baddeck and one on the west coast (Cheticamp down to Mabou) or the reverse.You will need to reserve places to stay in advance.Edited: 11:59 am, February 20, 2020 "
"Doable - I'd skip Peggy's Cove and go further down the road to Mahone Bay. It's a 50 minute drive from Halifax and much more interesting. Halifax to Baddeck is about 3,5 hours and Baddeck is a lovely spot. I'd use it as your base and drive the Trail from Baddeck going inland through the Margaree Valley to Cheticamp and coming out at St. Anns. Then head back to Halifax next morning."
"Hi again,This is an alternate itinerary. Is this doable without rushing too much? added an extra day to spend in halifax.Fly to Sydney on Thursday evening and rent a car and drive to Baddeck. Stay the night in Baddeck.Day 1(Friday): Explore in and around Baddeck all day.Day 2(Saturday): start travelling to Cheticamp(3.5 hours) Around 6 hours with stops. Arrive at cheticamp around 1pm.Day 3 (Sunday) : Explore in and around cheticamp. Sky line trail. Meat cove maybe. Either drive to Halifax or stay the nightDay 4(Monday): ): Drive back to Halifax. Explore Halifax all day.Day 5(Tuesday): Wake up early and drive to Peggys cove, mahone bay and lunenberg. Arrive back to Halifax and leave on the last flight to Toronto."
Yes you could do that. Check into flight costs and car drop-off costs.If you go to Meat Cove it would be on Day 2.Go to the Halifax airport from Lunenburg and allow two hours for that plus the time you need to return the car and to be at the airport.
"Hi again,I checked the car cost and it’s double the price compared to same drop off place. 650 vs. 320 ish for a compact /economy. Checked Priceline/Expedia through kayak.When do you think hotels and car rentals would start booking up for September long weekend? Even though it’s end of February should I book hotels/motels already?Thank you so much!"
Try looking directly at car rental sites. These links have listings:https://bit.ly/2IXU9d0 Halifaxhttps://bit.ly/2VkoWmL SydneyThe long weekend is a popular time so once you have flights and car worked out it would be advisable to make reservations for places to stay.
"We booked Haliburton in Halifax for 2 nights, Telegraph House Hotel in Baddeck 1 night and 2 nights in Silver Linings Inn and Motel in Cheticamp.Any reviews for them? I can come back and leave a review after we come back:D for now very excited for september and being internet free and free from Toronto crowd!"

"I stayed in a cabin at the Telegraph Hotel for 1 night. It was small, but ok. I wouldn't spend a whole day in the Baddeck area, though, just not that much to see there except the Bell museum, unless you were going to go out on a boat on the lake for several hours."
Definitely rent the car from the airport with your proposed timeline
Booked a car through Budget Car rental for $306 :)
My trip is coming up in September. Suggestions on whether I should cancel or wait a bit? Definitely will be cancelling if there's a 14 day stay home order still in place:'(
I would cancel. We are unlikely to lift our present restrictions for some time to come.
"I'm in the same situation. Cancel now or not? Flying into Halifax mid September is the plan and flying out 10 days later. Airline reservations were made last Fall. Accommodation reservations were made last Fall. I'm thinking I'll assess the situation in early August. I don't see any benefit for me to cancel now. Based on when I made my WestJet reservations, I understand there is no penalty if I cancel due to Covid 19 as my Rewards account will be fully re-imbursed. My concern at present is for the owners of the accommodations I have reserved."
Keep track of our quarantine requirements. https:/…travel
This may loosen up around the third week of July. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/n…
"Interesting! Presumably, if NS allows all of Canada by mid July then other maritime provinces would have to follow suit. Unless, of course they man their borders."
NB and PEI do man their borders. I do not know what they will do.It is unclear to me about whether visitors from outside the Maritime Bubble would need to self isolate. I have the feeling not as there is a huge need to get some tourism going. It is taking a huge risk for sure as things are not good in some other parts of Canada. We have had no new cases in nine days now and only two people still with active cases.
"No point in opening tourism and then forcing people to self isolate. Things are much better here in Quebec now, Ontario as well.We will see how it pans out over the next month."
Just to update this forum and close it...cancelled trip this year. Will try to book something for 2022
"Anika that was a good idea. Things are not yet good enough in some places in Canada for us to want to open up, especially with school about to start and all the uncertainties there."
