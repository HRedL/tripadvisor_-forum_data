"As promised last week.....Ige says he will give us all the answers today, at 2:30 PM Hawaii time. He's doing another press event at the airport....I'm sure Ingram from Hawaiian Airlines will be front and center.I'm glad he's finally going to publish a policy and hope it has safeguards for EVERYONE. It needs to be comprehensive and yet flexible--which are 2 words govt isn't very good at usually, LOL. I still predict it will be a policy very similar to Alaska's.Here's an article from Maui Now with some info and Mayor Mike's comments today:https:/…Anyone who has plans in July or August needs to follow this, and make sure they understand what the new rules may mean for their plans.SW"
Waiting and to see..
I'm wondering how long these rules will last. My money's on ... not at all. The Mainland's cases are blowing up ... which wasn't supposed to happen in warm weather. New York State and a couple neighboring States are talking travel restrictions/required quarantine. Europe doesn't want us either.
Thanks for the heads up. Do you know where we can watch it live?
"Misty, I *assume* (we all know that's prob a bad thing, LOL) all the networks here will carry it.Hawaii News Now, KITV, and KHON are the three big ones. All of them will prob stream it and have it on their SM feeds too. Maui Now may as well."
Here's a link to: HNN:https:/…KITV:https://www.kitv.com/KHON:https://www.khon2.com/ and Maui Now:https://mauinow.com/
"It's live on KGMB,Aug 1st starts pre-arrival negative tests to avoid quarantine. More to come as it continues."
"On August 1st, a pre-travel testing program:1. ****Valid NEGATIVE test 3 days before arrival equals No quarantine. Test results must be in hand.2. No Valid test equals 14 days quarantine.3. Temperature screens and if a 100.4 or more, they will be separated and given time in an air conditioned room before a second temp scan. They will also be offered a CV-19 test.These are the big points of the new policy effective August 1, 2020."
"Thanks! Found it on Ige's facebook page. Comments show locals aren't happy about it. Pretest negative with entry August 1.I will happily take a test before and at arrival. Whatever is required.Edited: 8:54 pm, June 24, 2020 "
Most of the comments on Ige's Facebook page were posted before the news conference.
"The question was raised ""What about Hawaii residents who might travel to the mainland for 1 or 2 days?""This has not been determined at this time and is under discussion. (Happens more than you might think. We typically go to Las Vegas for 3 nights/2 days. Last January I went to Boston for 1 night. (Departed Monday, came home Wednesday.)The question was raised: ""Who will monitor and verify the results? The airlines? National Guard?"" The answer was ""The State will be conducting the program."""
"LOL, don't forget that Josh Green also said not to do exactly that.....and for that matter said people shouldn't be going to Vegas right now at all or the ""hot"" states.Unfortunately, at this time there aren't plans to require a second test after arrival (for those with tests ahead of landing). There should be. Most experts say only one test will catch about 30% of infected people, due to the nature of the virus. That nearly doubles with a second test days later.I found their statement that the case load would have to double twice over two two-week periods frightening. They used this to answer what would make them shut down again. In other words, week one doubles from 2 to 4; week two doubles from 4 to 8; week 3 doubles from 8 to 16, and week 4 doubles from 16 to 32. Now put those numbers in higher values and you can see why I think it's far, far, too long an ""observation"" period."
"Thanks for the update Akamai. Sadly, with a party of 9 and young kids; I am afraid we can't take any risks.I think we'll have to cancel our Mid August trip, any issues with us trying to get a full refund from timeshare rental?"
"I understand, and would feel the same way in your circumstances!I don't know what your timeshare rental will say. You'll have to reach out to them. I suggest doing that ASAP."
">>>LOL, don't forget that Josh Green also said not to do exactly that.....and for that matter said people shouldn't be going to Vegas right now at all or the ""hot"" states.<<<Copy that. With our July trips cancelled, our next trip to Las Vegas is September 27 to October 1st.Time will tell how that's gonna shake out!"
"Yep, kaukau. I hope they reconsider the 2 two week thing. That's nuts."
"This is great news for anyone determined to visit Hawaii despite clear evidence this virus is on the upswing in the US. Tested negative three days ago doesn't say much about COVID status upon arrival.What is acceptable documentation of a negative test and how reliable is it?And the focus here is visitors being the vector, but this is a two way street. Clearly locals are the source of spread currently. COVID negative travelers risk exposure during their visit. Total number of cases in HI is relatively low compared to other states, but Hawaii currently has the highest rate of spread of any state."
"Practice, good to see you :-). Glad to see you agree about the one test not being enough....They haven't nailed down what test/documentation yet. They said they are still working with CVS. What the cost will be, and what *other* companies' tests will be acceptable remains an unknown right now.One of their reasons for not doing a second test automatically is the number and burden on our labs. They said they need that 'room' for residents' tests. A legit issue, since they have successfully ID'd a couple of clusters on Oahu and Kaua'i through tracing and testing.They said we can do about 5000 tests a day now. I'm skeptical that number is real, LOL.Edited: 10:29 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"After reading a couple of news articles about today's announcements, this leaves me with more questions than answers. For example:- What specific test will be considered acceptable?- If you get the test 72 hr before you fly, but your test results are positive for COVID-19, do you get to cancel your flights last minute with change fees?- If you test positive for COVID-19 and you have a VRBO or AirBNB type reservation, I suppose you're out all of that money if you don't have trip insurance that will cover COVID-19?- What if the lab is slow getting results to you?- What's the cost of this test going to be out of pocket? Many people's insurance won't cover this sort of thing since it's for a vacation.For our family of 4, a test of ~ $120 a pop is almost $500. Bleh. I understand why the state of Hawaii is doing this. They don't realize how many tourists will NOT go because of this. I don't think the boost to the local Hawaiian economy will be as big as they hope. However, for tourists who ARE willing to go through with this, they will reap the benefits of fewer tourists at restaurants and local parks and such."
"- What specific test will be considered acceptable?*************No one knows yet.- If you get the test 72 hr before you fly, but your test results are positive for COVID-19, do you get to cancel your flights last minute with change fees?***********That will be between you and your airline, like always.- If you test positive for COVID-19 and you have a VRBO or AirBNB type reservation, I suppose you're out all of that money if you don't have trip insurance that will cover COVID-19?***********Like airlines, that will be up to the owner/agency/company- What if the lab is slow getting results to you?***********Alaska's has tests that can be returned to a mobile device. I believe CVS is one major company in consideration for Hawaii and already has that capability.- What's the cost of this test going to be out of pocket? Many people's insurance won't cover this sort of thing since it's for a vacation.***********Who knows? Again, some of these are individual things that will be up to each traveler to ask and determine where *they* live, are booked, and more.Remember, you could still come--just like before. You would be quarantined though.*******************************************Arizona is such a huge hot spot I can see why you can't get tests these days.Edited: 10:48 pm, June 24, 2020 "
Something is supposedly in the works with CVS. I'm hoping it's along the lines of showing your confirmed plane tickets to Hawaii to make an appointment for a rapid test before departure.
"Here's the link to the CVS COVID-19 testing info page: https:/…testing-information-locationsSome notable highlights: Only a few states give same day results: CT, GA, MA, MI, RI. The rest of the states get the results in 3 days. There is no cost with insurance. You must reside in the state where you are being tested.Not all CVS locations will offer tests.And lots of other hoops to jump through."
"SW, good to see you, too. Appreciate your well informed updates.Fricking CVS. Our local Long's Drugs used to be awesome. Since it converted to CVS, it is awful. I hope Lahaina Long's is still Long's if in name only. Love that place!Anyone else thinking this is a giant corporate money grab?"
Too many hoops to jump through along with too much risk to throw away all of that money last minute in case one tests positive.
"So far the official ""word"" as reported on Khon2 evening news is: ""For Hawaii residents who choose to go to the mainland for only a couple of days, maybe something like getting tested when they come home and then maybe 'lay low' 'til they get their results.""Hide me, Rocko. I gots to lay low 'til the heat is off."
My fee is 500.00 to pick you two up. Then I charge another 500.00 per week to hide you.
"Clearly not for everyone, but an option that works for those who choose to travel. I think we will find the testing is workable."
It's still 5 weeks away. A long time if you're hanging on by a thread now.
"""They don't realize how many tourists will NOT go because of this.""Maybe they do, maybe they don't. You are exactly right though. There is no way we would go with all of those unknowns. Thankfully our trip was supposed to be July 25, so we already canceled."
Should have been the policies all along.
"That's false KauKau...mother and father in-laws got ""rapid"" screening last night with results in hand last night.KY."
Hawaiian Airlines Aug 1 non stops are now at $1000+ RT.
"They haven't announced **what test** will be accepted, so no one can say yet how much one will cost or how long it will take."
"""Hawaiian Airlines Aug 1 non stops are now at $1000+ RT.""I show Alaska OAK-OGG at $260. R/T for the first week of August."
">>>That's false KauKau...mother and father in-laws got ""rapid"" screening last night with results in hand last night.<<<Not exactly sure to what you're referring, but if it's my post #22 where I provide a link to the CVS COVID-19 Testing Information Locations, with a few bullet points referenced, here's the excerpt from the link:>>>""Will people get their test results on-site?No. Unlike the large-scale test sites that CVS Health is currently running in Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island, where the test results are delivered on site, these specimen samples will be sent to an independent, third-party lab and the results will be available in approximately three days.""<<<"
I imagine for the first month or so flight prices will hit rock bottom. These airlines are going to want to fill those planes as much as possible. Just like the prices that were found in March and April. When they see what the demand is the prices will rise. It would be foolish to book at huge prices right now.
"Per this morning's interview with Lt. Gov. Josh Green on KHON, rules for Hawaii residents making quick trips to the mainland (2 or 3 days, a long weekend, etc.) have not been decided. Longer trips - a week or more - would require the same 72 hour test with negative results.Under discussion is a test 4 days after returning home, or possibly even a 14 day quarantine.He repeated discouraging quick trips to high risk places like Las Vegas for the rest of the calendar year."
"SW,Thanks for keep us informed on the constant changes. Our flights are still on for October. The same trip would now cost $3,000+ though we paid $1,700. Guess now it is all a waiting game. I live in the Indy metro area and more and more clinics are displaying banners for testing. I believe testing will get better and better as the months pass by. Now that some feds are pushing for a travel tax break, I believe people will try to work in travel as much as possible. This will be interesting for sure."
"Ravekid, glad to help!I agree that the next couple of months will be very interesting."
"Geez I hope for a vaccine. We just spent 4 months waiting on a passport that was sent for renewal pre-covid and just received (of course, our int'l plans are postponed -- but i was imagining never seeing the passport again, and I was a wee bit stressed about it since the state dept could never give an update other than 'application not found'.) I would hate to have reservations for Hawaii and not get the results back in time -- esp if I was the only person in my family who didn't. Crazy things happen. But good for people who want/need to come."
"In an exclusive interview tonight on KHON, Gov. Ige said it is important that visitors and returning residents get tested within three days before departure. The cost to the traveler will be $140 plus $20 administrative fees.The Governor said he still does not think it is a good idea for Hawaii residents to travel just for fun, despite the fact that he's asking visitors to travel here. ""I know that might sound hypocritical but we do believe that Hawaii is a safe destination, and we want to keep it that way"". He said he doesn't like the idea of residents getting tested here before they go on short trips. So the same rules will apply for residents and visitors and they should all plan ahead to get their tests. He expects to have test sites on the mainland widely available, so that they would allow someone planning a trip to Hawaii to show up and say I'm planning a trip to Hawaii. I need to come in within 72 hours and get the sample taken.  The governor also said he's working with hotels and airlines to have more flexible cancellation policies in case travelers get symptoms at the last minute."
He'd better get his Muppet act together. The Alaska DOH is disclosing quite a few problems.
"""The cost to the traveler will be $140 plus $20 administrative fees."" ""Administrative fees."" Lol. Code for money grab.Geez, That will really add up for some families. Bright side is savings due to restaurant, activities, etc. closures will offset the expense of testing."
"I think even the governor knows residents, not tourists, have been the bigger cause of spread. Common sense especially as a tourist you would now avoid as many as possible."
"where can I find what the ""definitive"" new rules policy for trans pacific travel? we would love to visit your state in September . thank you."
">>>where can I find what the ""definitive"" new rules policy for trans pacific travel? we would love to visit your state in September . thank you.<<<Here you go: https:/…"
"""The cost to the traveler will be $140 plus $20 administrative fees.""So that's $180 a person. $720 for our family of 4. No thanks. We won't be back until after all testing requirements have been removed."
"I wouldn't say the cost will stay there, SE. They are just starting this whole thing. They are also talking to Walgreens and Kaiser, so the cost may well come down."
">>>""The cost to the traveler will be $140 plus $20 administrative fees."" So that's $180 a person. $720 for our family of 4. No thanks. We won't be back until after all testing requirements have been removed.<<<Well, it's actually $160 per person, but that's not my point.My point is, I think Gov. Ige, has found a way to ""open up"" tourism for his pro-tourism constituency, while still severely limiting the number of arrivals with increased regulations and costs for the isolationists, as demonstrated by S E's refusal to return under these conditions.Shrewd, that one!"
I would feel much better about getting on an airplane knowing everyone was tested for covid. I prefer this rule to be in place.
">>>I would feel much better about getting on an airplane knowing everyone was tested for covid. I prefer this rule to be in place.<<<You won't be getting on any plane where ""everyone was tested for covid.""As Lt. Governor iterated in an interview on KHON2 with Grace Lee this morning, ""Legally we cannot require anyone to be tested. That is why the quarantine is our best weapon.""Consider all the factors that might not allow a passenger to have a negative result in hand when boarding - delayed results, for one - no one will be denied boarding for not having a COVID-19 test in hand. For those who arrive without a negative Covid result in hand, they will be required to quarantine for 14 days, just as prior to August 1."
"Yes there is always the worst possible outcome. Maybe someone will not get tested who does have covid and get on a plane. I could also get it staying home at the grocery store. I could get grocery delivery and get it from the deliver guy. This is the best option. I would imagine most people will get the test on time to not cause any delays in their trip that is costing them $1000s. I have had two test, I am telling everyone, it is not that big of a deal. Call your doctor, they will have a recommendation. Getting medical clearance is something doctors do all the time, you need it for many sports."
">>>This is the best option.<<<That is consistently the position of Lt. Governor Dr. Josh Green as he has worked to implement policy.In a second interview this morning addressing this exact question as posed by a viewer, he repeated that the odds of contracting covid on an airplane are negligible."
Re: #52 - What is also a possibility is some tourists will choose to vacation elsewhere instead of running the risk of losing thousands of $$ from having to cancel something like a VRBO in Hawaii.Time will tell over the next several months and we'll see how this all plays out. I think that Maui is going to see a heck of a lot more small businesses closing their doors for good in the next 6 months.
"SE, I think everywhere will see a whole lot of businesses closing in the next 6 to 12 months. Maui and/or Hawaii are hardly unique."
"Re: #55 - True. But this is a Maui forum. And usually posts talking about things that pertain to other areas get removed by Tripadvisor, so I'm trying to stick to the posting guidelines. :-)"
"Camping has become wildly popular, check the stock prices on Winnebago and Camping World. Other than that not many safe options. I would still feel safer in Hawaii than on a cruise, in Mexico or at Disney world."
"Just listened to Josh Green talk for a hour on Kumu radio. When asked about children getting tested he said they are working on a plan, but he thinks if their parents test negative they will too.... so MAYBE a kid under 15 won't have to be tested. That could save families some money, and worry.He also would like to see the test return time raised up to 5 days, but doesn't want to push the Gov, right now! ;) In other words in case you can't get results in 72 hours, possibly having a 5 day return window, before travel. Partnering with CVS, and Walgreen's, also said your private physician could also do the test.He answered questions for an hour, he does it every Friday at 8am Hawaii time: KUMU FM, follow them on Facebook, or follow him, Josh Green LT. Governor of Hawaii on Facebook, and Instagram. --Lori"
">>>I would still feel safer in Hawaii than on a cruise, in Mexico or at Disney world.<<<That's the plan: ""Plans in the works to market Hawaii as the ‘safest place in the world"" https:/…From the article: ""Most Hawaii businesses remain closed and the stay-home orders have not yet been lifted, but plans are already in the works to begin marketing the state to tourists as “the safest place on earth.”"
Probably sound like a dummy here... but where does the 140.00 figure for testing come from?
"One of the recurring questions in this thread centers around getting refund or credit for VRBO, Airbnb, hotel, etc. It's clearly a valid concern. At the risk of presenting a dumb scenario, I might suggest this is actually a great opportunity to snag a great deal. Here's what I mean: It's quite apparent that occupancy rates are incredibly low. And airlines are incredibly flexible about change fees. If you can find a great deal on airfare, why not book the flight in Aug or Sep or whenever ... take the test 3 days before ... and if all are negative, you now have a very powerful negotiating tool, right? You can now confidently book any avail property with significantly reduced risk of having to cancel. That would open up some great deals for last-minute condo or hotel vacancies, would it not? Tell me if I'm missing something obvious here. Just seems that any resort or management company would LOVE to take a last minute reservation from a party in which all have tested negative."
">>>Probably sound like a dummy here... but where does the 140.00 figure for testing come from?<<<Not at all! It's the approximate cost (plus $20 ""administrative fee"" ) as estimated by the Governor at the time of the program's announcement.This morning the Lt. Governor repeated the estimated cost as ""Somewhere between $120 and $160. This may go down as additional screeners enter the program, such as Walgreens and Kaiser."""
"Bumping for ""Wes""."
"Since I just linked the OFFICIAL Press Release in another thread, I am linking it here as well. I think the second paragraph pretty much says it all:""The Health Department is still in the process of developing this program but anticipates requiring an FDA-approved PCR test from a CLIA certified laboratory. Travelers will be required to provide printed or emailed pre-test certification as evidence of a negative test result. Travelers will be responsible for the cost of the pre-travel test.""https:/…Edited: 8:18 pm, June 29, 2020 "
And as expected......the EU has banned US travelers. But they can come to Hawaii..................arrrggghh.
"Didn't Josh say the other day, that they can't ban the Mainland US, because Hawaii is the USA too? He said he was no lawyer, but he was pretty sure they couldn't? I wish they would close our borders here, not let Vegas people up to Northern Nevada, or let California in... but they never will!--LoriEdited: 2:30 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Lori, I've posted hundreds of time that we can't ""ban"" people. We never have, in fact.But we CAN make them quarantine."
"And NY is getting super serious about the quarantine there. More states added:""Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that visitors from an additional eight states — California, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Tennessee — would need to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to the state, which has brought its numbers down dramatically. People traveling from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas had already been required to quarantine. ""We could pay a most horrible price here, given the plan to reopen. Many experts now say the tests miss as many as 60% of people infected."
"Do you think the Gov will cancel opening 8/1? Seems like its the worst time, but he is skating a fine line with health and economics.--Lori"
"Lori, I think that is the billion dollar q.....and like you, one I don't know the answer to, either! I think much will depend on the next 2 weeks. But they are opening hotels, selling airline tickets, etc. like everything is fine.......so my gut says no. I think they will press ahead and *at most* require a second test within a few days of arrival (which many of us think should be done anyway!)."
"Swwhere did you find the info that the PCR test misses 60% of infected people? I find it hard to believe... And are you sure EU people can come to Hawaii? As far as I know the Europe ban is still going on, since the federal government declared it in March."
"Cris, I didn't say EU can come to HI....I said US can (without quarantine).As for the 60% I have seen it in several news articles, including some from the NYT. I should have been more clear and said ""up to"" though-as many studies show between 40 and 60% are missed."
"Got it, thanks."
No worries......I heard CO. is going up again (in cases)? The Metro area or others? Hope you stay healthy!
"I am trying to clarify info for arrival on Aug 1. With regard to the 72 hours, is this being tested within 72 of arrival or receiving results within 72 hours of arrival?Is there specific information regarding the test type required or valid testing locations? I have read all the generic “fda certified lab” kind of stuff but I am looking for very clear info - this test, this testing site. It sort of seems like they released the announcement of new policy without specific guidelines for how to comply with it."

"Patience, Grasshopper :-).Yes, they announced without the full details, but that was to help people plan and businesses too."
I read somewhere that kids are not going to be required to get tested.Has this been confirmed yet? I am contacting my local CVS to find out the specs!
"No, that has not been confirmed. And your CVS won't know either."
"From KHNL and Lt. Gov. Josh GreenThe state hasn’t yet said how they’ll handle residents who go to the mainland for short trips after quarantine restrictions have eased. What has been made public: Tourists will no longer be subject to a 14-day quarantine if they present a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before they land. But what about kamaaiana with travel plans? “Many of our residents go on short trips,” said state Rep. Richard Onishi, who is one of several lawmakers anxiously waiting for details. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said he believes the plan will have separate rules for those on short trips because of the incubation period of the virus. “If you’re only going for two days, there’s certainly no value in getting tested immediately when you land there"" Green said.With the tourism restart set for one month from today, residents returning to Hawaii from out of state might still have to quarantine despite restrictions lifting for visitors. The state is still working on it's plan for August 1st, but the Lt. Gov. anticipates those away from the islands for longer than six days will be treated like visitors, and must provide a negative test within three days before their flight home to skip quarantine. Those traveling for less than six days would need to quarantine after returning home and then get tested because the virus has an incubation period. ""The idea will be, that, I think, we'll ask people to self isolate for a short period of time and then get a test. The goal would be about five days after returning to get a test to be cleared."">No point at all in going for a short trip if those regulations are put in place. Better to go for a week. Truth be told, almost no point in traveling at all until this is over. Covid-19 has sucked all the fun out of air travel to/from Hawaii.

"Lori, I hope the higher numbers will go down in the next few weeks, and also, keep in mind that anyone flying to Maui will have tested negative, so those increased rates are actually *more* concerning to Mauians who visit the mainland. I am not saying the are of no concern the other way, but a lot less than you might think, or be lead to believe. As for taking all the fun out of it, I know what you mean, there is just so much misinformation, and extreme opinions on both sides. I have distanced myself from a lot of the discussions as much as I can and I do hope to be visiting our place soon, rescheduled from June. Aloha"
">>>keep in mind that anyone flying to Maui will have tested negative.....<<<If only that was true. In fact, a negative test will not be required to arrive in Hawaii. Those who do not have a negative test in hand upon arrival will be required to quarantine for 14 days."

I'm scheduled for mid August. If that doesn't work Ill reschedule another couple months out :) I'll be getting tested and I wear a mask everywhere I go!
"Dave, I hope you are right........but I am not near as optimistic as you. I don't see the ""No Test"" group as being low risk at all. Based on the last few months and the growing problems on the mainland, I expect them to disregard quarantine in great numbers."
"Dumb question again by me (Hey it's my forte')is there any talk of giving non quarantined tourists at the airport a wearable waterproof brightly colored bracelet type thing to wear at all times. it might make those that are supposed to be quarantining but are out and about at restaurants, shopping, and beaches easier for authorities to spot.Edited: 6:31 pm, July 02, 2020 "

"They are being purposefully vague, IMO.....reports vary and they also admitted there have been at least 60 people exposed:“Out of an abundance of caution, we have cancelled our flight attendant training for the next two weeks in order to deep clean our facilities. All of our instructors have been tested, and the approximately 60 employees who have been through our training program in the past week have been asked to self-quarantine and monitor their health,” he said.""The SA also has a report that one of the 6 flew ""one flight"" last week before feeling sick.

That's the chance anyone is taking regardless if they have a test taken beforehand or not. Getting on an airplane during a pandemic is a crap shoot. You will need to weigh the risk.

Has often repeated:- The chance of contracting Covid-19 on an airplane is extremely low.- The system is not a silver bullet- These measures will reduce the number of infections coming into our State by 80%- This is what we have decided is the safest way to reopen Hawaii to tourism"
"You pays your money, you takes your chances :-).People who choose to not get tested but DO quarantine are following the rules. The biggest issue will be trying to track them all."

">>>Not really fair to those of us trying to play by the rules.<<<Unfortunately, and I do mean unfortunately, the rules cannot require pre-arrival testing, but can allow those who pre-test negative to skip quarantine.Hawaii cannot stop U.S. citizens from entering nor require they be tested prior to entering. Hawaii can require a quarantine, which has been referred to as ""Our best weapon."" by the Lt. Gov."
">>>People who choose to not get tested but DO quarantine are following the rules. The biggest issue will be trying to track them all.<<<Always spot on, SW."
"Awww, mahalo! We'll see if I was spot on about the TRO in Judge Otake's courtroom.......probably today :-). Here's an update from Civil Beat, after yesterday's hearing:https:/…Edited: 2:26 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"Dang, I win! The order is out and we won."
"Selfish and groundless those who filed the lawsuit:- ""The quarantine restricts my right to travel"". Ummmm, no, you can travel, you just may have to quarantine.- ""The quarantine restricts my right to make money."" Not a ""right"".- ""I want to visit my sick mother and not quarantine when I return."" Ummm, quarantine for thee but not for me.""?Good ruling."
"One good thing about the ruling is that it also confirms the validity of the ""new"" process, by virtue of its scope. The very best thing about it is that if we have to shut down again or if they change the August 1 date, this ruling preemptively closes the door to another challenge. The Feds look very dimly on repetitive actions in cases where definitive rulings have issued.If I were the plaintiffs, I'd be dropping the suit. The writing is on the wall. An appeal to the 9th won't serve any purpose except to enrich Dhillon some more."
"Here's a link to the Order, as posted by the SA on scribd. I couldn't link a copy earlier as I would have had to use my PACER account to do it, and I (oddly, I know, LOL!) don't want to give the TA world access to my account:https:/…from_embedIt's only 35 pages."
"""Unless my memory fails, the Lt. Gov. Has often repeated:- The chance of contracting Covid-19 on an airplane is extremely low.""With all due respect to LG Green, there is much evidence to the contrary. Science aside, much of the current spread in HI and on the mainland is attributed to family gatherings. Of course airline passengers are not family, but spending hours in an enclosed area in close proximity to many others certainly seems on par...worse actually given the volume of people involved. There was an interesting Q&A with Dr. Fauci and five other experts published in WaPo today. All of them said air travel is essentially a no go for them right now. It is behind a paywall so haven't included the link here, but it helped clarify for me the importance of masking, physical distancing, limiting exposure by limiting the number of social encounters especially right now. Stay safe everybody."
