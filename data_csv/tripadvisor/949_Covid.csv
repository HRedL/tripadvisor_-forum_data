"Are people still booking vacations during this time to the Estes Park area?Can't find anything on the State of Colorado website ( im sure im not looking at the correct place) regarding staying away. Supposed to come in Friday, but concerned things may not be open. I have noticed the Covid statisitics aren't as bad as other states."
"All you have to do is scan the many, many topics on the Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park Forums to know that people are visiting Estes Park and RMNP in large numbers. Per square foot, Estes Park and RMNP are probably the busiest places in the state. To limit the number of people in RMNP, timed entry reserved permits are required. If you don't already have those, good luck booking them during the time you might want them.
