ok - so i've experienced bad mosquito's before...and am up to date with yellow fever....but how bad is the news with dengue cases in RdJ?upi.com/Health_News/…
"I live here for thousand years and never had any dengue, malária or yellow fever. Nor any of my friends. The only real case that i've heard, excluding the media cases, were from a friend of a friend who stayed in a hospital for one week, last year.But, How you can see, , just one case in an entire life, and not even a close person, shows that the situation is not so bad. Use protection against the mosquitoes when in the open areas, and you will be ok.Welcom,Brazil Rio."
"Use DEET. Most insect repellents contain the chemical DEET, which remains the gold standard of currently available mosquito repellents.Wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, particularly at dusk.Sleep only in screened areasAir-conditioning may reduce mosquito infiltration. Where air-conditioning is not available, fans may be helpful. Mosquitoes appear to be reluctant to fly in windy air.Do not wear perfume.Minimize skin exposure after dusk.“The mosquito's preferred breeding areas are in areas of stagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, and discarded tires, but the most dangerous areas are wet shower floors and toilet tanks, as they allow the mosquitoes to breed in the residence.”http://bit.ly/13Xtud“It is a daytime biting mosquito with peaks of feeding in the two to three hours after day break, and the couple of hours before dark. However, indoors or on overcast days the mosquitoes may bite all day.”http://bit.ly/vy8nSC"
"My mother said that she thinks my cousin of 8 years old died of dengue. Not sure. This was in 2008. She lived in a very underdeveloped area of Rio de Janeiro state. In an area where the hospital is very frail, and studies of why someone died is rarely done if ever thinkable. That is just an anecdote story in the family. From what I have read, the problem is one particular area (Rio de Janeiro city like in the middle) Not so much the touristic area. I don't live in Rio. I used to live in Rio in 1994. Since a while before we have been hearing about dengue. The problem is the rain and people. We have lots of slums, underdevelopment. We need to conscientize the population that the government can't stay in every stagnated water where the mosquito breeds.Unfortunately too, the mosquito is immune to insecticide of some..by research recently done.Also, from what I heard, the dengue spreading in type 4, a dengue that they said hasn't been around for the past 30 years. Hence, most of the population younger than 30 years old doens't have the immunity.At any rate, a person can get dengue again. I think the main thing, is really know the symptoms, and hurry to a doctor. One needs to hurry in less than 12 hours, I think if they think they have the symptoms."
">that is just an anecdote story in the family. From what I have read, the problem is one particular area (Rio de Janeiro city like in the middle) Not so much the touristic area.A. This is totally true. Most of the dengue problems are in shaky places and surrounding areas,not in fancy areas where the tourists use to stay, but it is not too much to use precautions everywhere. just in case.BR"
"Dengue is a very serious disease, a kind of ""the worst cold/flu you can take"" with some potential risks, no doubt. But 99,9% of the cases till now (as it is almost every year) are taking place on the suburbs and the western, northern areas of Rio, neighborhoods very far from the south and center most touristic zones of the city.Take the above cautions and enjoy your trip!"
"The lethal cases are few and generally depends on the previous health condition of the person. Dengue, however, can ruin a trip. It mimics a strong influenzae infection and the person can barely get out of bed. It is more severe and dangerous in elders and babies/small children, but anyone has to go through clinical and laboratorial exams to see if the blood counts are ok. About the precautions mentioned above: I live in Ipanema, and mosquitoes bite me inside my apartment quite frequently, despite any efforts to avoid it, but I only got dengue aprox 25 years ago when I was a teen. So I think to try to avoid mosquitoes is silly and can lead a person to an almost paranoid state of mind. On the other hand, both my parents, who also live in an urban environment, got dengue in the 2008 epidemics, and I, as a doctor, worried a lot due to their ages and low blood platelet counts.In my opinion, if you are a tourist and wants to come to Rio, the best precaution is to read about the epidemiological moment of the disease and avoid the city if the cases are too frequent, as they are right now. I would also say the summer here, due to the crowds, rains, heat and dengue cases too, it is not the best time to visit. Come btw june and november..."
