Hi! We are very alarmed with the coronavirus. Can someone confirm if it is safe to travel in these places next week? Thank you very much. We are considering to cancel our trip.
Don’t cancel.There’s much hysteria about this.Look at your government’s website for travel advice.
There is now 14 threads on here about Coronavirus !!
"It is safe to travel to Southeast Asia countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar. These countries have reported only a small number of cases, and methods are taken seriously by the governments.Indochina Pioneer"
"You would be nuts to cancel :Bigger chance of dying in a traffic accident in this region than contracting Covid 19.I have been in all those countries during the last month and my only worry was that they check your temperature now when crossing borders, and not so sure what they would do if you are running a fever because of a cold or something equally innocuous. Being quarantined because of a cold would be crazy. ."
