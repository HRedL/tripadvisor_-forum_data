This doesn’t make good reading for the cruise industry. It possibly proves that it’s very difficult to contain this virus on ships. It’s not said or possibly known how this virus infected those on board. Possibly an asymptotic passenger or crew member?I’ve loved my Hurtigruten expedition cruises in the past but not something I’m rushing to do again in the near future. It mustn’t be forgotten that this virus is not going away any time soon. https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/travel/202…
Afaik it was crew members who was infected.
"Crew members from outside Norway. 33 cases after testing. 166 crew on such a small ship, they are bound to live in close quarters. Not good enough."
"Can you share a source that the infected crew had come from outside Norway? I was under the impression they were operating with a domestic crew, due to the immigration restrictions (since they’d already planned for the mid-July sailings before the border opening was announced)."
"Crew members are the only ones for whom there currently are test results. The passengers had disembarked prior to the cases being detected. Passengers have been contacted and asked to test, and I hope that Hurtigruten will be open about the results. Currently we do not know if the infection initially started with a crew member or with a passenger.Agree with Klima that the crew often live in close proximity so one case would likely propagate much more rapidly among the crew than among the passengers.Not good news for Hurtigruten and for the cruise industry. I have a trip bought in December on board MS Lofoten and I'm not so excited anymore to be going. It's difficult to distance on board MS Lofoten and the ship is currently sold out (it's supposed to be her last voyage)."
"Philippino crew plus 1 German and 1 Norwegian + 1 passenger. The passenger is probably the one that were also Hurtigruten crew and has mingled with colleagues.36 active cases so far if I remember correctly, 4 in hospital in Tromsø.I have been reading NRK and Bergens Tidende on-line, BT behind a paywall unfortunately. Crew quarantined and tested before boarding according to Hurtigruten, so a bit of a puzzle how this could have happened in the first place. Time will show if they find the weak link.Some communication issues between Hurtigruten and the authorities have been reported, leading to delayed information to the passengers."
"I did see that they've had some of the crew travel from outside. but they required quarantine and two negative tests before leaving their home country. https:/…93-En-alvorlig-situasjon-22395774.eceIs the passenger you mention the one from Vesterålen who was on the previous trip? https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/2GLwVR… It's interesting the travel companion tested negative. It's surprising, but it aligns with what they found on the Greg Mortimer, where people sharing a cabin had one test positive and one test negative."
"I think it must be the one from Vesterålen, but only guessing, as he would be likely to mingle with the crew. Two negative tests in their home country, still possible to catch a virus en route. False tests even possible, I am surprised they accept those at all. There must be a weak link somewhere.Edited: 7:59 am, August 02, 2020 "
Hurtigruten press release : https:/… (not sure there is anything new).Given the wide range of symptoms that have been seen for Covid I'm curious to know what are the symptoms that prompted the isolation of crew members but were not deemed symptoms of Covid. Surely at this time whenever anyone shows any weird symptom you must assume that it could be Covid? Indeed there has been a weak link somewhere.
They had medical doctors in plural onboard as well. It is all a mystery.
"Soph, I believe their COVID policy was that anyone presenting any symptoms of illness at all needed to isolate. Sounds like that turned out to be a good idea!"
"I understand Kaisatsu. What I meant to say is that I'm puzzled by that part of the press release : ""The initial four crew members that were infected were isolated several days ago because of other disease symptoms, showing no symptoms of COVID-19."". Given that the symptoms of Covid can be as diverse as cough, fever, runny nose, stomach troubles, muscle ache, tiredness or skin rash, I wonder what symptoms the crew members were showing to allow Hurtigruten to say that they were not showing symptoms of Covid. Especially since those four later tested positive (during a ""routine testing""? really?). So are we to believe that these crew members were asymptomatic for Covid and fell ill due to a totally different disease altogether? (poor people, and what is that disease and is it contagious?).When I read this I feel that Hurtigruten is treating this a bit lightly. If I was paranoid (which I confess I am slightly, at the moment) I would even feel that they are trying to cover up a blunder. Whatever the reason, if it was possible for 36 crew members to be on board when positive to the virus, something went wrong somewhere. And this is scary because Hurtigruten is supposed to have all the bells and whistle in terms of sanitary precautions, so it means that even these precautions are not enough, and this does not bode well for ship travel in the upcoming months."
"Hurtigruten cancels all expedition sailings on MS Roald Amundsen, MS Fridtjof Nansen and MS Spitsbergen until further notice.https:/…The coastal route is not affected at the moment.Really, really not good news :( (and I hope all the affected persons will be allright)."
"Well maybe I was not paranoid as I though when I mentioned there had been a major blunder, as it is now aknowledged by Hurtigruten's CEO himself : icepeople.net/2020/…What a mess :("
"I think the same as you Soph, I would love to know what symptoms they were showing that made them so confident it had nothing to do with Covid!Now they are worried that there might be an outbreak in Tromso and all along the north western coast..... not sure if I should postpone my trip to Tromso or not, supposed to fly there in just over 10 days."
I think the health authorities are reasonably on the ball when it comes to track and trace and they should have good contact information for passengers and crew so unlikely there will be a major problem in 2 weeks.
"Thanks, fingers crossed. First time in Norway and thought it was a safeish choice when I booked the flights a few weeks ago so am really hoping I can still go."
"It is still one of the safest in Europe ! This is an outbreak on an expedition cruise, very unfortunate, but I do not believe it will affect the overall situation much.Use this link for reference https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaEdited: 10:24 am, August 03, 2020 "
That is true. I think it's only the fact that many passengers got off in Tromso that's making me a little bit nervous.
"I agree with Dyoll and Klima that I don't think this will lead to an outbreak in Tromsø. Most passengers were Norwegian and will abide to self-quarantine measures. I think most of them actually went home? Or are they quarantined in Tromsø?I think this will mostly be hurtful to Hurtigruten first (there is a lot of trust to be rebuilt here) and to cruise travel in general 'm crossing my fingers that it will not lead to an outbreak in Norway, but I think Norwegians authorities have the right measures in place to test and trace, and contain. Still I'm happy that the passengers didn't go ashore in Longyearbyen."
I am also happy they never got as far as Svalbard as I am hoping to go there too!
"Oh, they were in Svalbard, it was a specific expedition cruise to/from Svalbard.Passengers of the first sailing went home, spread all over the country.Second sailing stalled in Tromsø, passengers in quarantine or isolation at a specific hotel used as quarantine hotel only. Philippino crew did not quarantine in Norway before boarding, new rules are in place as of today.It was indeed the passenger from Vesterålen who initiated the alert, testing positive after getting home."
"This is a mess indeed. Hurtigruten did not follow the health authorities instructions to notify the passengers last Wednesday. Instead they waited 2 days until Friday, when all the alarm bells went on. The police in Tromsø has now confirmed that they will investigate Hurtigruten for breaking the Norwegian Disease Act. E-mails from last week regarding this outbreak of Covid-19 is leaking to the press. https://www.nrk.no/nordland/interne-e-poster…Soph, I guess you already follow the news on NRK (if not is a pretty reliable source of unbias information).https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/politiet-…"
"Yes they went to Svalbard but did not land passengers in Longyearbyen (it was scheduled for the next voyage though). Apparently they offered local transport for two women (which was really not smart) to an isolated cabin, the women were coming from a sailboat and subsequently also found contaminated... But they are in a perfect location for isolation. So hopefully this will not spread to Svalbard which has officially been Covid-free so far.Yes Pippi thanks for the links. I read info in Norwegian media (with Google translate, so the meaning is sometimes funny) but I try to include links in English as well (but they have to be taken with a grain of salt always). The account about the email asking to keep Hurtirgruten's name out of the story is pretty damning. I don't think they could afford to mess up like this when all eyes where on them for being the first company to resume commercial cruising.Edited: 1:13 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"The two people in Svalbard tested negative over the weekend and are supposed to have been tested again today: https:/…Also, the governor of Svalbard has denied further port access to the Spitsbergen (which was sailing roundtrip itineraries from Longyearbyen) due to the uncertainty in how Hurtigruten handled the situation. They will have to sail to the mainland to disembark the passengers and do testing of everyone en route. https:/…"
Thanks for the correction about the 2 persons in Svalbard. Probably a good precaution to take MS Spitsbergen passengers back to the mainland. I hope no one tests positive.
no Crew quarantined before entering the ship
