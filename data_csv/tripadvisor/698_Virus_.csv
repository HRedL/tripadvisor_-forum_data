Hello -- Just wondering for folks that live in or are traveling in Shanghai -- have you noticed any changes related to the virus?
Right now the place is kind of empty as people have gone home for the new year.
All tourist attractions that have gates have closed.
"Not only tourist attractions but also e.g. temples and cinemas, but surprisingly not everybody is wearing masks (yet). But that could be because they are sold out at a lot of shops."
"At this stage mask remains a self protection measure, not mandated by law."
We will go visiting Shanghai between Febr2nd to Febr4th...….I need your comments / information if this would make really sense to stay during that time in fear and not having fun as proposed.Your advice ?
"It's a bit ridiculous to see that in the last few days dozens of people keep asking the same question: should I travel or cancel?Come on, your are adults! It's your decision and you have to make up your mind. How would it help if a random stranger on TA told you to cancel and then another stranger to travel?!Edited: 8:24 am, January 25, 2020 "
"#6 Most people on here are not experts in public health medical emergencies. I doubt that any of us has access to the current official data. You should look at reputable media reports.From the BBC I have learned that the Chinese President has said that the spread of the virus is accelerating. He stated that the country is facing a grave situation.The government is restricting the movement of 56 million people. This is a decision they have taken upon review of the full facts. It is not a decision they will have taken lightly.Rather than ask whether, in the current circumstances, your fun might be curtailed, perhaps ask yourself whether it's a good idea to travel to a country whose citizens are suffering in an accelerating and grave public health crisis."
"@8 makes some excellent points...sadly until travel is completely restricted some will just ""want their holiday"" and continue to go and risk others by doing so."
Does anyone know ... is Taco Bell open at least ???
"Here is test for you, try wearing a mask for a day back home. You should have goggles too, proven case of virus entered from eyes. Not just a few minutes, all day. Now if you think wearing a mask 24/7 breathing your own hot exhaust fume is fun or okay, then go to China."
"Now even Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street has been closed off by massive police deployment and there are also photos that show that even local markets streets are shut down.Therefore right now there isn't much you could do as a tourist. and I would probably cancel.Though my personal opinion, on the danger of the situation, is different from most people and that is because every year there is a far more dangerous outbreak of Influenza without causing any media hype."
"Sorry, too late to edit.@MacIs that as proven like your statement that children are not infected? Or perhaps could it have been mouth to eye or hand to hand to eye or hand to object to hand to eye or...........Edited: 12:34 pm, January 25, 2020 "
"Flu doesn't kill, it is the complications caused by flu that cause death among weak and old. There is no tracking of flu deaths, because there is no flu death report to track, it is an estimate by CDC of the death triggered by flu. Google search to read more. Beijing suspended all buses in and out of Beijing. It is not a media hype."
"Do you know what you breath in when you wear a mask? CO2, Carbon monoxide, at least it is our own carbon monoxide."
"And who are the majority of the Coronavirus death's so far?According to information available to me the youngest was a 48 year old male with underlying health problems. Most others where ""weak and old""."
Many tourists that come to China are older and often have unlying health issues....they are managed and fine for travel UNLESS they come in contact with a virus like this. MAC makes a good point...if you have ever worn a mask for many hours you would think twice about going. And actually the N95 mask which are really the ones that have best protection are even more difficult to wear for long periods of time. I assume most of the tour companies have cancelled groups coming in and the real season for tourism does not get going until March or April.
"That is why a French researcher thinks this is just a big serious flu, not like SARS, but so far nobody else agree with him, they think he is crazy, but maybe he is not. Most Coronavirus patients self recover in 7 days. You can easily google and search yourself, surely you have access to all international news? Facebook is covered with Coronavirus news nonstop, it is the leading news in the US, before Impeachment trial."
CO2 is Carbon Dioxide.Obviously when wearing a mask one doesn't breathe in pure carbon dioxide. The body can take much more carbon dioxide than it is usually exposed to. Some athletes train in masks because at a greater level than normal it can be good for the lungs.Why do you post this stuff?
"There are still many tourists wondering they should go to China, they need to know they must wear masks all day. Can you imagine tourists still want to go play in China when the entire country is in crisis? That is why. They have no idea how serious this is. Do you? Any clue?Or you can waste time argue among ourselves.Edited: 3:04 pm, January 25, 2020 "
"Yes Mac, I have unrestricted access to international news, google and alike but I'm boycotting facebook:"
"Be careful, google tracks you, too, every click. Your family is sick with contagious disease and people want to come over to your home to play."

"In my country, that is common, because we can have different opinions and we don’t silence opinions we don’t agree with. People are free to choose what they want to believe. You happen to think this virus is no big deal, I think it is a big deal."
All I am asking you is to stop your scaremonger postings
"all of the cases in USA that are confirmed ...they have been in Wuhan...many others suspected....this is all based on ""self reporting"" you can't make everyone who has been there in the last few weeks report to a hospital so it is being spread right now...the only question is how fast. I don't see Mac's posts as ""scaremongering"" at all...just reporting what is happening...which happens to be ""scarey"".Edited: 3:15 pm, January 26, 2020 "
I was curious to go back to posts in the beginning of the outbreak. I wish more people would have thought like you!
"I said this 1/25: “Facebook is covered with Coronavirus news nonstop, it is the leading news in the US, before Impeachment trial.”But now many westerners saying China didn’t tell them, China was hiding the virus. But Coronavirus was headline news on national and local TV news daily, on Facebook 1000 times a day. How can anyone say they didn’t know? It was on every TV network, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, FOX. Coronavirus news was on your phone 24/7. This was 1/25/2020, 3 months ago."
"In fact, almost all of Chinese people started to wear face mask from then, some even earlier ... And you can read news and papers from Nature Journal or Lancet in Jan to know the research result. Don't blame China hide the info, China told everything including the genetic code... You need to blame those companies who make the fake news for money, per a post in this forum. Yesterday, a state of the US ordered face masks from a vender in China, guess how many? 7 billion!!!!!!So please wear masks when go out, stay at home as much as possible, it is a great contribution to your family, community, and nation."
"My nephew’s girlfriend, 20ish Caucasian woman, has a very bad flu November 2019, she fully recovered; all the symptoms were exactly same as Covid19. This was in Northern California, no foreign travel. This is someone I know. It is too early to say when and where Coronavirus started, or did it start from one area or many areas simultaneously? There have been many similar November and December cases in the US and Europe too."
Besides the e-cigarettes cases...
"@Mac has your nephew's girl friend taken antibody test yet? It would be a good data point for understanding the virus and the disease.Edited: 11:17 am, April 21, 2020 "
"On ABC news 4/19, one reporter tried to volunteer for the antibody test donation for many days, many phone calls, no success yet. Not so easy."
there are far less travelers than pre-virus time... not so crowded.
"Also, note that the flu season in 2019 was merging with early Covid cases so one cannot go by symptoms alone which are very similar to Covid. Without tests to prove it is merely speculation and rumour at best to say it was already in other countries.It was mentioned in another post that if early Covid was occurring outside China in mid to late 2019 like being claimed the hospitals did not fill up with so many dead people so very unlikely to have been Covid, instead the flu. US CDC has stated that 35 million US people got the flu in 2019 period with 35,000 deaths, yet Covid in only 3 months of 2020 has over 50,000 deaths with lockdown to reduce it and hospitals are full.Edited: 9:30 am, April 28, 2020 "
"Some prominent scientists, including Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health, said the virus might have been spreading quietly in humans for years, or even decades, without causing a detectable outbreak.According to some estimates, the ancestor of Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, might have left bats between 50 and 70 years ago. A recent study by a team of geneticists in Oxford University estimated the first outbreak of the current pandemic could have occurred as early as September last year.They found that the dominant strains circulating in China and Asia were genetically younger than some popular strains in the United States.https:/…"
"For thousands of years, pandemics disappeared mid to late Spring, judging by Coronavirus reports from the Far East, that is exactly what has happened. Most Far East countries reported zero or very few local Covid19 cases in the last 3 weeks. It is gone. Amazingly accurate. SARS also disappeared in April and May 2003. Unfortunately this old folklore doesn’t cover barbarian lands, Europe and America. With global travel, Far East now on guard for imported cases."
"After SARS disappeared, I was be able to visit Singapore in August 2003. Singapore Airline had promotional sale (flight+hotel package) to boost tourism that year after SARS epidemic. It was a very nice trip. Let's hope this pandemic will be in control in the near future."
"Coronavirus is gone in most Far East countries, over. Exactly as predicted 4 months ago. Not Singapore, they have migrant workers dormitory issues now. It will be more months before travel restrictions lifted."
">> Unfortunately this old folklore doesn’t cover barbarian lands, Europe and America.New evidence says it started in the US since Nov 2019 (as a state governor mentioned he got the virus) and Dec 2019 in France (in a paper by French, some French doc re-test the ""flu"" sample... )Poor China, the kid in The Emperor's New Clothes, told the world, ""Look, there is a new virus... ""Edited: 9:19 pm, May 06, 2020 "
"Covid-19 cases in France can be dated back to as early as November 16, nearly 10 weeks before the country’s first confirmed cases of the disease were thought to have occurred, according to a French hospital.The November case was identified by the hospital’s medical imaging department after carrying out a retrospective study on about 2,500 chest scans performed between November 1 and April 30.The findings came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on countries to investigate pneumonia-like cases from late last year to get a clearer picture of how the new disease spread.https:/…Edited: 1:36 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"Be careful to travel to China, a second wave could be in the next days. Some new cases with covid-19 in Wuhan"
"Wuhan has ONE CASE, if you call that 2nd wave, liar liar pants on fire. Rest of the world still at top of first wave.You can’t go anywhere, you can’t even transit through any country, You can’t go anywhere to the rest of the world unless you transit, let alone you cannot enter China, you are not allowed nor welcomed to go to the US or China."
"Actually, Shanghai Disney reopened yesterday, the only one so far. A mask is, however, required."
Is it true that the US deleted the data showed first case in Jan.?
"#45, I think you are being fed bad information, likely sponsored or at least encouraged by the Chinese government. Foremost among those is that the virus originated in the USA. Which to those around the world outside China, is accepted to be categorically false and pretty much proven by genome sequencing....including data from China-based scientists. To your question: As far as anyone knows, the first case in the USA was a Washington state man who had returned from Wuhan in mid-January. This has been documented in the general media and in respected medical journals, such as the following (New England Journal of Medicine):https:/…NEJMoa2001191While it's theoretically possible that there was an earlier case in the USA (particularly if asymptomatic and undiagnosed), I have seen nothing that suggests any such data is being suppressed or deleted. That's much more difficult to do in a society like the USA, compared to China where it is routine. I suggest that as this pandemic unfolds, you be very very careful in your information intake and processing, since there is a lot of blatant falsehoods as well as nasty insinuations coming out of the Chinese government at the top levels. They have a lot to answer for, and while you may not be aware of it, the world is very very angry at China because of this virus and wrecking the world, and doing a lot of re-examining of economic and political relationships that will bring changes in the long term. Likely for China, not favorable changes.Edited: 10:45 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"So far earliest case with scientific proof is 11/16/2019 in France, but wait, as they are tracing back and looking at old records. There was a case in Wuhan in November, Just wait. I have seen many TripAdvisor and Facebook posts about September-October serious flu cases with C19 symptoms, but without scientific backing. Covid-19 cases in France can be dated back to as early as November 16, nearly 10 weeks before the country’s first confirmed cases of the disease were thought to have occurred, according to a French hospital.The November case was identified by the hospital’s medical imaging department after carrying out a retrospective study on about 2,500 chest scans performed between November 1 and April 30.The findings came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on countries to investigate pneumonia-like cases from late last year to get a clearer picture of how the new disease spread.https:/…"
"kv, while I agree with what you said here:""I suggest that as this pandemic unfolds, you be very very careful in your information intake and processing, since there is a lot of blatant falsehoods as well as nasty insinuations coming out of the Chinese government at the top levels.""Similarly, you can say the same about information from some US government officials. Especially since this is an election year, an attack on the Chinese government is seen as helpful to get votes in the US. So there is a continuous talking point about the virus being manufactured in the Wuhan lab. And maybe even the virus being released intentionally to harm a particular politician. This talking point is being propagated by high ranking US officials even though US scientific research has disproved that the virus is manufactured.There is nastiness on both sides."
"But this virus started in China, and due to deceit and lies (and suppression of Chinese doctors and scientists that tried to alert their country and the world), things got out of hand quickly. Had the Chinese government entities (national, provincial, local) gotten out in front of this and clamped down severely by end of December, the course of world history and this pandemic might have been completely different. Buffaloing the useless WHO into going along with downplaying the situation was egregious. Whatever the failings of the US federal government (and they are too numerous to list, starting with lack of top leadership), people aren't being ""disappeared"" and at least discussions/arguments about the situations can take place. So that is a false equivalency. Nearly anybody with a brain has discounted the far right wing theory about this virus being manufactured in a Chinese lab. Again, the point being that this argument can take place, and publicly. Regardless of the US election year, the Chinese government deserves to be attacked. And this goes way beyond the US, so don't fall into the trap of making this just a two-way fight. There are plenty of other countries that have developed some big grudges against the Chinese. Not only for letting this virus get released into the world, but also for the issues of supply-chain problems for critical equipment and chemical components. One good thing that may come out of this pandemic, is a redefinition of ""essential supplies"" and turning away from China for those essentials, to either sourcing from home or to a more reliable business partner. Maybe China is good for silk floral arrangements and tablecloths, but not for critical components."
"""Nearly anybody with a brain has discounted the far right wing theory about this virus being manufactured in a Chinese lab.""Are you calling out secretary of state brainless?"
"#50 US Secretary of State may have some brains but not the guts to stand up to falsehoods from the President.The SMP news reported French Covid virus strains as originating from Belgium which in turn from China. The origin is not really that important.CCP’s COVID19 cover-up and mistakes are nothing compared to their illegal organ harvesting business of their own people, see here https://dafoh.org/Tens of thousands people organ harvested over the last 20 years in China. Who needs any sci-fi movies of aliens involved.Edited: 12:07 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Looks like pile of baseless rumors by bunch of yahoos. In human histories, the rise of each new country was met with verbal and physical attacks such as lies and wars from the established powers and their citizens. It is the price for China to pay to endure and overcome, something all new powers suffered and overcame. It’s going to get worse, be prepared."
"DAFOH is an international organisation of doctors against CCP organ harvesting, not a bunch of yahoos. Look into the web link and other information to see how your wonderful civilised China is, it is not a conspiracy site. Many other country parliaments have condemned the practice, made laws against it and some banned their citizens from seeking fast harvested illegal organs in China."
