"We will be arriving from St. Thomas into the West End and will be renting a car there. We have about 6 hours on the island.Is it possible in the 6 hours to basically circle the island with a stop or two in between?I really would like to drive over the entire island to get a good overview.Most posts I have read seem to indicate to start on the west side of the island and go north (Rte 1/Zion Hill). There is only one post I could find about a “counterclockwise” tour, and that direction is what I was thinking would be the best for us.Here are the two options that I was considering…comments/thoughts?Option 1 – starting at the West End ferry port.Basically, a counter clockwise tour of the island.Head east/north on Sir Francis Drake highway. Follow that all the way around the south part of the island and continue on to Waterfront Drive/James Walter Francis highway/Blackburn highway through Road Town and up to Parham Town.Follow Ridge Road heading back south until it turns into Rte 1/Zion Hill. Follow that all the way back to the West End with a stop at Cane Bay.I also would like to make a stop for a quick snorkel at Smugglers.We would stop to have lunch someplace along the way.Option 2 – starting at the West End ferry port.Basically the same as Option 1, but instead, only go as far as Road Town and then head west over the mountain and pick up Ridge Road there and head back south to the West End."
What is it that you want to see/do? Circumnavigating the island is certainly doable in six hours... three or four times.:-)
"We love driving around the smaller Caribbean islands and taking in the views, stopping for a beer or lunch and talking to the locals.We do want to snorkel at Smugglers and perhaps have lunch at Quito's and a beer at Stouts.Based on the reply from RJP-NJ, seems like we should have plenty of time .I was not sure how long the drive along Ridge Road would take based on other comments I have seen. I know you need to go slow, but was not sure how long that ride would take.We may then take a ride up Sage Mountain as well to take in the view from there."
"Isn’t entry into the BVI not an option for visitors? I thought no one including Belongers could enter until further notice? There are at least 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19; and last reports stated no entry by sea or air...Edited: 8:37 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"If you decide to postpone your travel plans until the current pandemic eases consider spending a few nights of your vacation on Tortola or another island of the BVI. A tour of beautiful Tortola is a must, and it doesn’t matter what route you take, just make time to enjoy the evenings, and to visit VG or another island."
Hopefully he is just planning ahead and armchair traveling like the rest of us!
"Yes, sounds like an upcoming trip into STT is already planned but I didn't see a date. But yes, that would make more sense Dune-Fine..."
"yes, a future trip.One that hopefully occurs when all of us are well and Covid-19 is either behind us or we have a vaccine."
