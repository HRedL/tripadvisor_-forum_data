"I have an email from Vrbo today, asking me to refund to travelers who cancel due to covid-19, and saying that they are refunding their fees as well."
"Pattie-2004, Vrbo refund their service fee?"
"Seems only fair. If you're going to ask folks to cancel vacations they've prepaid, there's no good reason you should benefit from their taking your advice."
Gee I cancelled last week - so you think they will backdate it!?!? :-/
"Pattie, Sue owns a condo on Maui."
"Iâ€™ve been trying to keep up on all of these threads, so I may have missed it. Does this mean they are reimbursing the owners the fees they charge if they agree to cancel bookings? But no help if the owners stand by the cancellation policies? I heeded the advice of the forum regulars, and booked through an on-island management company. As of now, they are standing by their cancellation policies.Edited: 12:32 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"This won't hit us as hard as it might have becasue we were talking to Realtors about selling the condo and didn't book far out. As of today we'd lose about $7K in rent -- while of course still having all the expenses of maintaining the condo. I'm not anticipating tons of new bookings in this virus crisis. I'm really concerned for everyone who makes a living from tourism -- for example, our excellend cleaner. She makes $135 per cleanout at our condo and those of other owners. No guests; no income. I'd sure contact Vrbo about this if you've cancelled. You may meet resistance from owners, but Vrbo says they will refund fees if the owner agrees to refund. Gosh, even *partial* refund would be good. I'm wondering about the traveler paying TAT and GE taxes (14.42%) on unused rent? (Even if Hawaii grabs tax whenever money changes hands.)"
"Kari -- As I understand the email from Vrbo, IF the owner will refund, Vrbo will also refund the fees they charge the guest. (Owners aren't charging or receiving Vrbo fees; those are Vrbo's commissions on the rental.)It's near PR for Vrbo, which will lose 6% - 8% while the owner loses thousands. Make them look good.Edited: 12:40 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I hope all VRBO owners in Hawaii got this email. The woman I rented through was less than understanding in the event Hawaiian Air cancels our flight next month.And NYS travel insurance does not cover Pandemic/epidemic situations or cancel for any reason.
"Really? I need to cancel, as our provincial government is recommending no international travel now, but because the Canadian gov't hasn't raised the travel advisory level, we can't get our VRBO rental covered by travel insurance. The thought of cancelling is killing me, because the owner won't let us shift the booking to later in the spring, and we'd just be trowing that $ away :("
When are you going Sarah? It might not be long before the Canadian Government raises the travel advisory level for travel to the U.S.
"I asked my VRBO condo owner whether he would give a refund in the event that flights are cancelled (or we actually get coronavirus before travelling) - he said no refunds and he ""hopes I have good insurance""Edited: 10:32 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"At this time vrbos letter is just a suggestion. The wording indicated that if owners issued a full 100 percent refund, VRBO would refund their service fee also.Note that there are thousands of individual owners on VRBO who are all struggling to come to terms with the new Corona virus reality which in the past 24 hours has been severely eacalated. Every owner/manager will come up with their own protocol and note, at this time VRBO is not forcing them to refund. I personally have processed one cancellation with two more asking this past 24 hours. Another owner friend told me he was well booked between March-June and in the past few days every one of his bookings has cancelled. I did not ask if he refunded or kept the money as credit for future bookings or stuck to the cancellation policy every one of his guests signed off on. These are frightening times for everyone, guests whose vacations are upended, but especially condo owners who rely on the income to pay their monthly expenses - association and utility fees (often $1000+/month), mortgages, property tax, insurance etc."
"@Mike 952 Here are the 2 responses I got from an owner at Lahaina Shores when I asked if she would allow us to reschedule, if our flights out of JFK were cancelled. ""All I can say is that if you want to cancel we will both be out 50% of the trip. I understand if you do cancel and not pay the second payment. I think that you should come to Maui and I hope that we get to host your stay on this wonderful island!""When I responded to her yesterday that I thought perhaps she misunderstood my 1st inquiry she replied""We cannot speculate what events may or not unfold. No one including VBRO is offering us compensation for canceled bookings. If you cancel before 30 days of the start of your trip you will not have to pay the second half. In that way we ""split"" the difference.""First time I ever booked through VRBO......I am sorry I did. ***We have travel insurance, no pandemics covered on policy in NYS"
"This is good and CHEAP PR for Vrbo. Today I answered an email from a guest who booked our condo last month -- staying five nights, starting March 17. I will approve their cancellation. (Vrbo requires them to first go to MY TRIPS to formally request this.)Vrbo tells me they will refund to her their fee ($158). I will lose their rent ($1475). Our cleaner will not get paid $135. Our condo association will not get their one-time registration fee. The state and county will not get 14.42% taxes on those two amounts, nor on the rent. The agency we employ to set up smooth registration and be on call for our guests will not get their fee (paid by us). We will still be paying $6K RE taxes, $8K condo association fees, utility bills, insurance, etc. for a 'business' with no business -- no different from ALL the businesses impacted by this crisis. (While the White House and Congress DITHER.)Edited: 11:03 am, March 13, 2020 "
"@Sue, thanks for outlining things on your end. I think many realized condo owners would be out rent, but to be informed about all the other fees that you all still have to pay and others on down the chain who depend on condo rentals is helpful. I wonder also why they don't institute a travel ban within the US as well (assuming that's what you meant by the white house dithering) and can only guess it's not to panic the nation. I think we're there already. Economics can be a delicate balance."
"Chisue, great you were able to do that. Tough situation but I hope that helps somebody.We have multiple vrbo and airbnb bookings (we are guests, not hosts). Airbnb has relaxed policies, been very easy to sort things out with them even when the original booking rules would not allow it. Vrbo on the other hand has been useless. Their direction is speak to the owners and the owners we have dealt with have just said no and no. I had no idea vrbo had made that behind the scenes offer regarding the fees. I guess it's something. Overall tho my takeaway has been don't use vrbo again."
"Not to pick on Sue--but all those biz expenses are tax items. A business loss is deductible.......This will be like after 09-11 and 2008. We will see things fail, housing sink, etc. It's got a ways to go."
"SW yes you are picking on Chisue. Sure those are business expenses. However this is high season, the revenue owners collect during high season subsidises year-round costs and the lower low season income and occupancy rates. Some owners are fortunate to own their condos outright and 'just' have overhead rates to cover. However many also have mortgage payments. If owners knew it were 'just one month', that would be one thing, however we have no idea how long this will drag on for, how many bookings will cancel and will want refunds and when we will start seeing revenue flow again. And so owners are looking at the long game, what they can afford while remaining afloat and not having to sell or even lose their condo. Most condo owners rent their condos in order to help pay for the cost of owning them, not to actually generate a profit. All the owners I've spoken with over the past week feel badly for their guests. However some simply can't afford to refund guests for something that is not the owners' fault either."
"Really tuff luck if you can not afford it, that is a business risk. You need to refund the money"
I'm having problems cancelling for a full refund as well! I thought I was giving them 3 weeks advance notice so that they could rent it out to someone else but they refused full refund. I hope people post if they are able to.
"No, I don't think an Owner *needs* to refund. Whatever is refunded is a good will gesture. It's certainly utside of the legal contract that exists between Owner and Guest. The Owner is obligated to provide the rental for X nights at X cost -- and the Guest is obligated to pay for what he contracted to pay.  If you decide to back out of buying a house, you'll lose your earnest money. It goes to reimburse the seller, who was unable to contract with another buyer while he was obliged to hold the property for you. IMO an Owner would show good will by offering to apply the Guest's payment to a future booking -- much as other *business* (airlines, hotels, etc.) will sometimes do."
Thanks for posting this. I booked with Vbro for the first time and am not getting any refund since I did not cancel before the 30-60 day rule. Out $1160 for a condo in Waikiki. Unfortunately owners like this make a bad name for everyone. Oh and yes I am going to let Vrbo about this.
"<""Oh and yes I am going to let Vrbo about this."">I think you meant ""know about this"" ... but unfortunately, any complaints about this to VRBO will likely fall on deaf ears. They are just an advertising medium. As ChiSue mentions above, it was just a suggestion from VRBO to owners to offer a refund. Is there a possibility for you to get a refund through insurance?"
"No, I am not picking on Sue, LOL, and she knows it.If you don't have at least 6 months expenses tucked away--you shouldn't have rental property. Period. And better practice is at least a year of cash reserves. If people didn't learn after 09-11 and 2008, then bad on them.Maybe some of those owners will finally drop rates and start renting long term to LOCALS."
"<""I thought I was giving them 3 weeks advance notice so that they could rent it out to someone else but they refused full refund. "">So many people are cancelling travel plans right now that there's probably only remote chance of them re-renting the unit that you had booked.  A partial refund seems reasonable, unless all they required for full refund was 3 weeks."
suedon't sweat the criticism. consider the source with apparently not much else to do in the real world people go to the poor house with business tax lossesthose that understand business know the idea is to make a profit not take tax lossesthere are fixed costs that have to be coveredhang in there
"LOL....thanks John, for the nasty personal attack. Gosh, you hadn't done that for a whole day!!!Sue has had her condo for going on 20 years. She's quite savvy. As for me....you have no clue what I do or don't know, what I have or don't have. And you never will, no matter how many times you demand I tell you. However.......it's no secret that I owned my own business here and also have had extensive real estate dealings :-).Edited: 12:33 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Most of the regulars on this forum are adept at assessing the passing 'humors' of others. I've learned to emulate 'the duck,' letting water roll off her back... and paddling on."
"Sue, that's cause you Chicago ducks have super strong feathers :-)!"
"it's been suggested to book your stay in a hotel to avoid this mess. I have only stayed in hotels for non vacation reasons, and any extended stay I prefer to spread out in a condo. Why are hotel cancellations better? Is the cancellation policy more lenient?I can't stand to spend a vacation in a hotel. Or am I missing some third option? A condo hotel maybe?"
I will NEVER book from VRBO again
"Received the same response from vrbo.After the owner refunds, vrbo will then refund their service fee only. From what the owner indicated, there are two other items vrbo should issue partial refunds on: daily rental rate % and security deposit.I am pursuing with vrbo and will update this review when finalized."
"I'm really disappointed with VRBO as well. We've used them for years with no trouble whatsoever, but their true colors have shown during this situation.We canceled a condo more than two months out (within the cancellation window), and the owner happily refunded our deposit. Now five weeks later, and VRBO still has not refunded the deposit. I called and asked where my refund was, and the representative said they processed the refund back in March, and they wanted copies of my last two credit card statements to prove that I didn't get my refund. I can't even believe they asked for that! I told them I wouldn't (due to privacy issues), and the email response was, ""We have reviewed your reservation, and the deposit was refunded back to your MasterCard credit card. Our system indicates that these funds are still in process of refunding as of 21 Mar 2020. Please be aware that due to an unprecedented and unusual volume of transactions to process in the context of COVID-19, refunds may take 5 - 6 weeks to process from when the refund was initiated. We hope that the situation will stabilize soon and appreciate your patience during this time.""Needless to say, I called my credit card company, and they reversed the charges. Who knows if that will stick. Very frustrating!"
"We had a rental at the Mahana through VRBO for July 3-11. Mine from the beginning had offered 100% cancellation if canceled by 5/4. At the time, Hawaiian Airlines was not allowing me to cancel my flight. So a few weeks ago, I messaged the owner if he would be willing to extend the May 4 date out a little. He replied that he would, but it still remained ""officially"" on the VRBO trips page that it was May 4. Finally, HA allowed my flight to be rebooked via voucher. So I canceled the flight and the VRBO prior to my May 4 100% refund date. When I did cancel it, VRBO said refunds were taking up to 4 weeks. I didn't want to risk losing my ability to dispute the charge by waiting too long, so I submitted a credit card dispute in the meantime.I have now rebooked at the Hyatt Residence Club for September through Redweek."
