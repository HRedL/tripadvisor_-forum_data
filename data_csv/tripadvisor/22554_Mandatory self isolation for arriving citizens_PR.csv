"Hi,I will be arriving in YVR this sept 10. I have a question regarding mandatory self isolation.1. Will health/gov authorities bring me to a designated quarantine facility free of charge?or they will just refer me to a hotel/accom then i will be the one shouldering the expenses?2. Or better to find my own hotel ( will choose the first option if it will be shouldered by gov,lol )Thanks"

"We do not know many things related to these policies. Should we bring a certificate from authoritative medical personnel about whether or we have been infected just prior to our anticipated time of arrival and present such documentation to Canadian authorities? Will such a valid document be acceptable as a replacement for self isolation or as a substitute for such policy affecting us? We ask dutifully ask these questions in preparation for a long awaited voyage there some time next calendar year. Conditions are likely to change for the better or for worse as so many questions remain unanswered. Please help us come to terms with these regulations. In the meantime we will remain away from the border.Edited: 8:23 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"Holy crap! Do not listen to the advice from Guido in #2. It's bad enough that he posts rambling nonsense on these forums, but this is just plain wrong and dangerous advice. I don't know where that moron comes up with his drivel. Showing a certificate of a negative COVID test result to a border official, will do absolutely nothing to get you exempted from the 14-day quarantine!"
It's hardly LOL to expect the taxpayer to provide you with accommodation. Why not pay for it yourself? Then it will up your standards.
Eyeroll at Guido. OP - you are expected to make your own arrangements and present a well prepared plan. If you don't do that I believe the government officials will help you to find a quarantine location at your OWN expense. Or send you back depending on how they feel. Do the right thing - organise it yourself.
"Begs the question. Do you not have a home to go to? You do not have to go to a hotel, you can self isolate at home under certain conditions, one of them being no-one over 65 at the same residence.There is no exemption from self quarantine for travelers who have tested negative for Covid 19."
