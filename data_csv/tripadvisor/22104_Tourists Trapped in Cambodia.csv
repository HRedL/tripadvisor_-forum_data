"16,000 Australian's flew out AFTER the travel ban!https:/…""While 3,800 of those left the country with a special exemption after the Australian government banned all normal overseas travel on March 25, around 12,200 Australian’s went on holiday despite clear advice from Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stay put.""Would really like to know when the 'stranded' tourists left the country... some decided to take a risk and are now paying the consequences.... some left before bans were in place but took the risk to keep travelling as there were alerts being issued.... some may have noted the warnings, still travelled and then have had difficulty getting back but.... some are just plain ignorant and do not heed warnings..... baffled baddles"

Some 300 Australians seeking to get out of Cambodia.Details here:https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hundreds-of-desp…Best regards. Ian
Ian - these news clips are confusing to me... are the 85 Australian expats in your 2 April article some of the 300 Australians mentioned in the second article?Are you saying 385 Australians are asking the embassy for assistance flying home? The UK embassy was destroyed in the media here because of the lack of assistance it gave its citizens wanting to go home. Are you putting the Australian embassy on par with the Brit embassy?
Hello Richard MI leave it to readers to draw their own conclusions from the print media articles.I am not taking a personal position on this. And certainly not posting one to forum.Best regards. Ian
Can these News reports be kept to just one thread?While there is not a lot happening on the Cambodian Forum... repeating or reposting the same information or report is starting to get confusing?Can I respectfully ask that a new thread be opened solely for these news reports/links?Cheers baddles
