What the Gov of Georgia is doing as of 4/24 ?
I have no idea what the Governor of Georgia is doing on April 24th. The governor of Nevada announced plans for that state yesterday. You can see a thread about it just below this one. ( it’s the “ Phase Zero “ topic) .
"Google is your friend, actually watching the news would be helpful as well, to fill in your blanks of current news....sorry if I'm sounding like that Irish Fan guy."
"“ Google is your friend,”If you compose a good thread, your audience shouldn’t have to go to Google to find out what you’re posting about. Give a bit of background. Post a link or two if needed. Then you’ll generate a good discussion.Happy posting!"

"Fortunately I don’t think many states will make decisions off of what some of our Southern states are doing.Edited: 9:58 am, April 22, 2020 "
Even in Georgia people aren't agreeing with governor. The mayor of Atlanta has already said things should stay shut down and numerous hair salons are saying they won't be opening up.
"Vegas won't be open for a while, they are in phase zero."
"The OP is suggesting the possibility of a secondary spike in Covid infection rates / incidence due to the relaxed restrictions in Georgia, and the resulting effects on Las Vegas travel, I guess? I don't know.. depends on what happens in Georgia and how hysterical the in-power decision makers become."
The Utah Governor has already published a 28 page document (Version 2 so far) outlining plans and phases. They will open up a few things around May 1.https:/…UtahLeads-April2020-v20.pdfOur Governor either will not share any future plans or if we take him at his word he has yet to think of Phase 2 and beyond. I did not expect him to have firm dates but there is no reason not to have a plan in place that he can modify as things happen. He is keeping us in the dark or he is in the dark himself.
"@InSeeno...I agree in that some sort of firm timeline ( labeled changeable) helps everybody. He's processing a ton of inputs from all sides, but so are all the other Govs. Maybe he'll have an epiphany soon...the reopening process will take a lot of time for businesses to put in place before any actual start date."
"@Chuck, Agreed."
Chuck that wasn't my intent at all.Georgia might establish the pros and cons of reopening his state regardless of the established medical guidelines.The results in Ga may prove that the guidelines are too restrictive and unnecessary and encourage other states to also reopen in spite of the guidelines etc..As others have indicated some small businesses in Ga will not reopen in spite of what their Gov has recommended.
No. It won't.
"@nuzzja...OK..I'm sure any post-reopening experiences in Ga will add to the info mix for decisions in Nevada and elsewhere. In spite of that, Sisolak will have a completely different set of inputs ( including any political leanings / pressures and actual disease stats) to consider vs Ga...so I don't think it'll effect it much overall. Might be wrong..."
"I'm guessing that whether states re-open this month or three months from now,there will be spiking. Probably until enough immunities are built up in the general populace. Georgia will be watched closely."
"well now we know something, Trump claims he told the Gov that it was premature with his efforts to reopen Georgia.However he apparently didn't advice him to change his mind but who knows what he really said.At today's PC Trump was bragging that he was responsible for the Gov being elected once he publicly supported him etc.Edited: 8:29 pm, April 22, 2020 "
