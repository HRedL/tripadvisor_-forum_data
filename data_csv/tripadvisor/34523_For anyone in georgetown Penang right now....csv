I would be most grateful if you could provide any information as to whether the coronavirus outbreak in China is affecting any of the tourist areas in Penang? We are due to visit Penang on 14th February for just under two weeks and naturally are slightly concerned given the amount of Chinese tourists that visit the island via cruise ship and plane. Thank you
"Regarding Travel to Malaysia, it's best to concentrate on UK FCO site advice etc, plus any precautions you need to take from official Health sites. Forums are not the best way to get factual information when travel involves a degree of risk. Currently I am reading that the risk is low, away from mainland China. I travel to Penang soon and am of course concerned. I will take all of the precautions I can and I continue to read updates daily.Sadly I read today that Malaysia now has seven cases.Would be very good to know though if the virus is indeed impacting on behaviour in Penang. Good point.Edited: 8:44 am, January 29, 2020 "
"Thank you, yes definitely I have been following very closely - so far Malaysia is not seen as unsafe by UK foreign office - it was more to get an idea of what its like there at present i.e. are tourist places all open, are the majority wearing masks and what the general atmosphere is there ie. business as usual etc"
"There were Chinese students all wearing masks in Leeds City Centre this morning. Not sure whether it is to keep them safe from us or us safe from them...!You would be better trying to source masks in the UK before you travel as I understand many pharmacies in Malaysia have sold out so best to take your own and do make sure they are good quality ones.Edited: 9:27 am, January 29, 2020 "
Thank you all for your replies - much appreciated!
"Yes, thank you indeed."
"Thanks for the info.I anticipate with further fatalities and another Malaysian case today, the most sensible course of action is to continue to look at Govt advice until the point of travel."
Thank you again paperscissorsstone for your comprehensive reply. Ha the thought of those dragons has definitely put a smile on my face! It's definitely all about putting eveything in perspective!!
