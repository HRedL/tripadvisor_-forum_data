"Hello,Currently we're in Thailand. We plan to fly to Cambodia on Sunday. Our final destination after spending 4 weeks in Cambodia is Auckland. We both have our working holiday visa confirmed. I am looking for some advise. We are considering cutting our trip short and travelling directly to Auckland on Sunday due to worrying about New Zealand completely closing borders soon. Is this likely? We would also like to know if we do get to New Zealand, we'd like to find jobs quickly and rent an apartment. Will this be very difficult in the current climate? Could even getting a good job be impossible at the moment anyway? Or is it normal enough in Auckland?Thanks for any info or tips provided."
You need a crystal ball. Further restrictions are almost certain. Forget jobs in hospitality. The world is headed through extreme ecconic turbulance.Time to hunker down at home.
"NZ is awaiting a major announcement from its PM this weekend. Doesn't sound favourable, and we have been warned that more travel restrictions will be put into place for NZ, to prevent any further covid-19 cases in NZ. NZ cases stand at 5 confirmed, and 2 probables. Read theImmigration NZ website for updated information - https:/…coronavirus-update-inz-response"
"As Mike says. At the moment life in NZ is carrying on very much as normal, however it's a rapidly developing situation. My assessment is that if further travel restrictions are to be applied, then SE Asia is a prime target. The restrictions could range from voluntary 14 day self isolation, to compulsory isolation, to a complete travel ban. So if you decide to continue your holiday then getting here sooner rather than later would be a good idea. Getting a job depends on what line of work you are looking for. Hospitality is in a nose dive at the moment, but if you are in the health industry (doctors, nurses, aged care) you would be welcomed with open arms. Construction workers are also in short supply. If it was me I'd be getting out of SEAsia as quickly as possible. Either to somewhere safe like NZ, or even better, Home."
Aron unfortunately your profile does not say where you are from so that may trigger something too. You need to update your profile.Barry is right get to NZ as soon as possible or go home wherever that is .
i would expect that 14 self isolation for anyone coming into the country will be introduced. At our workplace we have notices advising that anyone who has been out of the country in the last 14 days should not enter and this is common
"That would effectively stop any visitor traffic into NZ.I understand the reasoning, but from a practical point of view, it's unworkable for visitors.I also can't see any hotels being willing to have guests locked up in their rooms for 14 days, particularly with the possibility that the whole property could be in lockdown for 14 days if a case is confirmed.It's going to be interesting."
#6 thats exactly what happening in Italy.
Latest confirmed case is traveller from the USA.
"Hi everyone. Thanks for the information and advice. I'm from Ireland and my girlfriend is German. I work in the wine industry and my girlfriend is in marketing. Our plan was to do this trip to then arrive in NZ with an eye to settling there more permanently if we can find the correct jobs. So this is really putting a dampener on our plans. Anyway I appreciate the advice and we're going to consider trying to get to NZ sooner. My worry is due to NZ being an expensive country to stay in and depending how long this goes on, that we burn through all our savings there looking for a job that is impossible to get at this time."
14 day self isolation is now mandatory for all https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…
"While its only a guess I would expect the wine job might be essier. There is alway massive competition for marketing jobs an we expect the economy to nose dive for a while, not sure who will be marketing.Your first 14 days are going to be restricted movement."
Thanks for the help.We've just been banned from Cambodia now anyway due to my girlfriend being German so only thing to do is book first flight to NZ and self isolate.
