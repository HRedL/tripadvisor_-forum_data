Does anybody know how to get tickets for the carnival. Is it essential or can you just buy them on the day?
"J&C,All the info you need can be found in english here...http://www.lorcaturismo.es/Semana-SantaThe schedule of events for 2020 has not been put up yet but will appear assuming the events are not cancelled.You'll see the link to buy tickets about ⅔ of the way down the page.You can also read plenty of background info in the english language courtesy of Murcia Today here...https:/…As of yesterday, 11/03/2020, the authorities in the Region of Murcia have initiated closures and cancellation of events as part of the strategy to disrupt transmission of SARS-CoV-2. You'll need to keep checking to see if the event still takes place this year.Fingers crossed!:-)"
