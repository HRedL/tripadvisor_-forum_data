"I understand that new legislation enacted today gives the federal government the right, if necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus, to temporarily suspend the operation of schools and all kinds of educational institutes, as well as cinemas, theatres, churches, sports and cultural venues, businesses, public organisations and other services and of large indoor gatherings in general. Has there been any discussion of whether any of the major tourist sites might be closed if necessary to contain coronavirus if it arrives in Greece? Thanks."
"“Federal government”, of where? The Greek state is not a federation,To be blunt, any answers you get will be meaningless speculation. Anywhere that people gather in large numbers - not just indoors - could be subject to restrictions; and that’s true for anywhere on the planet whilst attempts at containment continue,"
"e aware that the H1N1 flu which is FAR more dangerous and lethal than COVID19 (15% of people affected by H1N1 die versus 2% affected by COVID19 and there IS a vacination for H1N1) has already cost the lives of 50 Greeks citizens. So we do have a virus outbreak at the moment that should concern you.So don't be a victim of media terrorism and apply the pandemic WHO guideliness. The COVID19 can ne lethal ONLY for persons over 70 that have already sever health problems or people of any age that have already VERY severe health problems. People with normal health will be fine even if infected as long as they follow doctor's instructions. Latest situation report herehttps:/…Edited: 5:47 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Thanks for the updates. I am less concerned with getting sick from coronavirus than being subject to a possible quarantine or the wonderful sites in Athens I want to see being closed temporarily. I will visit Athens and enjoy its spectacular gems, it is just a matter of when."
"We will be arriving In Athens Tomorrow 2/28. Praying that all public areas aren’t closed! If anyone is there now, has anything begun to shut down in response to the small number of cases (1 now in Athens)? We are hoping our trip will not be ruined!"
No nothing is shut down.But all carnival celebrations were cancelled. (Like everywhere in the EU)
"Thanks a lot. Not that any of you are my personal Athens concierge, but if drastic measures are taken between now and tomorrow can someone please post? Appreciate it!"
Thanks! Here’s hoping! :)
Leaving tomorrow for Greece and just though I would check on any recent developments with the Coronavirus?
https:/…8 schools are closed in Athens and Greece has 4 cases.https:/…https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/…
We’re here now. All good. Nothing is closed & we’re having a great time. Safe travels!
Thank you!! I’m usually a pretty chill traveler but the news this week has made it very stressful. Looking forward the some fun & relaxation!
Thanks JES522. Have a great time.Dare I ask what the weather's been like - about to decide what to pack!Thanks!
"Hello, I am traveling to Athens soon. Do you know if the restaurants and the city is more quiet because of the coronavirus? I don't see anything about the attractions closing down but I just want to check."
"I have just read an article on www.ekathimerini.com which may answer your question. It says that there appears to be less visitors than would normally be expectedEdited: 4:07 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Thank you but I'm more afraid of public sites being shut down: https:/…koronaios-h-pnp-me-ta-ektakta-metraDo you know if any are?
If anyone is hoping to see the Olympic Flame Lighting ceremony apparently its now closed to spectators:https:/…
Italy announced total lockdown. Not to create panic or anything but we should all be prepared for the same to happen around Europe (including Greece) with the way things are headed. Feels like it is just a matter of time.
There are some on this thread that are more concerned about sites being closed down than catching the virus . So you catch the virus spread it around to others and then maybe get quarantined in a country you have no idea about . Thats really going to help the situation. 15 Days ago you were advised it was not that bad it may or not spread and that it was over exaggerated by the media. Well what a difference 15 days make. You need advice about this just contact your local government not TA cause no none here knows .Today Greek govt is already shutting down large gatherings and events in 3 regions https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coron…
"Sadly, following a dignosis of COPD today I have been advised by my thoracic Consultant to cancel my Athens trip next week.Very disappointed.My room rate was non-refundabe - a first time I havent booked refundable rate - so will lose all monies paid.I might ask the hotel if they could change the dates to later in the year, but don't hold out much hope.Maybe next year."
"Question - is there an official guideline on self-quarantine issued by Greek govn? Can’t see anything on moh.gov.gr? For example in UK they now advise to self isolate if you have been to certain parts of Italy, even if you don’t present with any symptoms.Is there any such advice issued by Greek government?"
"Yiassas thank you!Really gutted but will see what the hotel say tomorrow.Whatever, we will come to Athens as soon as we can!"
"Bronia, it's very disappointing that you've got to cancel your trip, but I'm even sorrier about your diagnosis of COPD. It's fortunate, though, that it came when it did: travelling would have put you at serious risk. Athens will still be here when the virus is a memory. Meanwhile, take good care of yourself while you're planning next year's trip. :o)Edited: 2:52 am, March 11, 2020 "
"We are about to fly to Athens tomorrow from Vienna, hope everything turns great :-) 3 days Athens1 day Hydra1 day Delphi+Meteora1 day IoanninaRegards,Filip"
Thankyou Alabastron for your kind words.Much appreciated!Still hoping to visit later in the year if at all possible!
"broniaUK, Mauritius smart move.I congratulate you.Athens is a melting pot of humanity . Streets are narrow and the best way to get around is by public transport or walk . Its a very crowded city and more so when a couple of cruise ships show up for the day. Its a beautiful city with charm every where but at the current moment I would stay away. We still have 2 full months to cancel our trip . It looks almost certain we will have to. I am shattered just like you.Edited: 7:03 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Thankyou comet27!I hope we will both be able to rearrange our trips to Athens for later if possible!We head to Cyprus in May and fingers crossed that what my Consultant said yesterday, that the worst will be the next few weeks and that things may be better by May is true!Fingers crossed for us all!"
"You won't see it in the news, but places like China are almost back to normal. Over 75% of cases are now recovered, and new cases there are very few in number. I think the world will be stable by April/May..."
"Hi, hows the situation in Athens as of today? My flight from Singapore to Athens is planned next Tuesday and am concerned if most attractions would be closed."
"Museums operate with an ""non overcrowding"" scene allowing limited number of visitors per time slot and hall.Archeological sites operate as usual (subject to change if situation becomes more serious).All gyms,theaters,cinemas,live music venues and clubs are closed Schools are closed.Cafes and restaurants are still open.""Stay at home"" is today's hashtag on all social media."
Toniboy12 Tell us some more please Whats the feel around Athens . You seem to be on the spot. . I know this maybe should have been a P.M but maybe others are interested as well . Regards
Had reply from Electra Metropolis today agreeing to my date change to October - yay!We were due to arrive next Wednesday.Now to change the flight.
"@funkymen34Can I quote your post # 5, if necessary. I need the author's consent. ;)"
"Restaurants and cafes will probably close after Saturdayhttps:/…Edited: 10:33 am, March 13, 2020 "
All museums and archeological sites are shut down too.
"Thank you to everyone for updating this thread. We are/were due to visit Athens For the first time at the end of this month. It’s not looking good sadly :( Please keep adding any information. If our trip proves impossible, will definitely make it some time in the future!"
"Thanks to Yiassas & Absolutely Athens for being the voices of reason on here. My trip in May will most likely be postponed to autumn, mostly because returning to work will require quarantine and doctor clearances! After 3,000 years, I think Greece will still be there whenever I get there."
"We are currently in Athens and have luckily been ahead of all the closures, just got in Sounion last night. I have to admit we are a little concerned about finding food. We have not been able to change flights to go home early.We are in good spirits for the most part. We were going to ferry to Hydra today. Do you think that's still a good idea? Thanks for everyone's help."
I am currently on Paros due to travel to Naxos todayAll bar and restaurant owners we spoke to yesterday said they will close their business from todayOnly exception was the souvlaki/gyros place which will still do takeaways and deliveries Does anyone know if there are any exceptions for hotels with regards to breakfast etc?Will update here and on Naxos forum when we get there
">Does anyone know if there are any exceptions for hotels with regards to breakfast etc?<Breakfast is forbidden too.Hotels should provide ""take away"" breakfast for their clients."
">I have to admit we are a little concerned about finding food.<All supermarkets,take aways,bakeries are open ."
Thanks FunkymenIt is a difficult situation for everyone and it feels a much different country this morning - a lot of unhappy people worried about the virus and also their livelihood Difficult decision as a tourist as the hotels etc need the money but I don’t want to be a drain on their valuable resources
Arrived at my hotel on Naxos and they confirm they are still providing a normal breakfast service - will not name the hotel as they may have misinterpreted the instructions Lots of Greek visitors on the ferry but town is empty and apart from a couple of takeaway places all closed upThe concern from locals appears to be that the next stage will be an Italy style lockdown with limited or no ferry or flight servicesHave decided to cut short my stay which means I will have to spend my 60th birthday at home in much colder weatherHowever Greece will still be here for later in the year - wishing all the best to all locals and local business in these unprecedented times
"I'm supposed to by flying to Greece in early May for a little over a week but I doubt this will be over by then. EasyJet are offering free rebooking of flights but I don't see how I can fit this trip in later in the year due to other plans so I am hoping the flights get cancelled so I can get a refund and then rebook for 2021. Seems all my accommodation apart from one of the nights is refundable too. Don't know about train tickets I've booked for a trip to Meteora.Got a feeling a lot of local businesses are going to struggle with the lack of tourism over the coming months, not just in Greece but all over the world."
"Also me cutting short my stay in Crete. Simply because at the moment it’s a gamble whether you will be able to easily get out today. Very sad for local businesses and most of Southern Europe, but hoping to return soon!"
All beaches and ski resorts are closed at least until April 1 Also the tourist season is being pushed back all seasonal hotels and resorts are closed until May 1 Although public transport and the Ktel long haul buses are still operating they are limited to half full. Bus entry and exit is limited to the middle door. Grocery stores will remain open but there will be a limit on the number of shoppers in the store at one time Greece has not experienced a run on groceries but hand sanitizer and wipes are hard to find
I'm meant to be flying in to Athens April 1st but have to accept this isnt going to be the case. I'm also hoping the flights get cancelled so I can get a refund on everything! Thanks for keeping us updated here
"I've cancelled my Greece trip between 3rd-19th April too, looked at Mauritius as an alternative, but in the end concluded that it's pointless planning any out of country travel until the global situation de-escalates. Best to be on home ground if this thing hits than to be stranded elsewhere."
Am not sure if this question has already been discussed.Is the Greek public health system particularly robust?is the private health system any better? Tks
">Is the Greek public health system particularly robust?<No,not at all ,it is overtaxed and due to the country's bunkrupcy very fragile ,at least we do have the most doctors per inhabitant in the world >is the private health system any better? Tks<yes still very serious cases are handled by the extremely experienced but over taxed public hospitalsThe plan is that from now and on ALL covid-19 cases will be handled by the public hospitals and ALL OTHER health cases will be handled by the private hospitals whιch will be requisisioned by the governmentEdited: 12:35 am, March 16, 2020 "
"thank you funkymen34. Your response was helpful. Dare I ask about the islands? I have received good service myself a number of times on Ios, Sifnos, Naxos and Koufonisia. Are the island's prepared for a potential outbreak? tks"
"All schools in Greece, all public attractions, all beaches, all restaurants, etc. are closed."
"In a letter to the the Minister of Shipping and Island policies, the vice-governor of the Cyclades (and head of the civil protection of the Cyclades) has requested to take immediate action for the movement of passengers by ferry to and between the islands.He asked:- to allow only permanent residents to move to the islands or between the islands. - In case of movement of citizens who are not permanent residents of the islands, they should prove the necessity of travel to the islands."
"EVERYTHING except pharmacies, supermarkets,take aways and bakeries is now closed.1 customer per 10 square meters ,2 meters between customers and controlled influx of customers in supermarkets enforced.Restrictions on movement of people during the day (appart from workers in the a/m categories ) are investigatedEdited: 7:52 am, March 16, 2020 "
"14 day quarantine for ALL visitors entering Greece was just decided (for the next 30 days)https:/…Edited: 8:10 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Just read that Jet2 have cancelled all flights to Greece, initially to 01 May. Presume other airlines will follow suit."
My flight to athens 1st april has just been cancelled. That was with easyjet
"I've been to many of those places in the video. Every time I've been to them they were filled with shoppers, people milling about, tourists, street performers and full of life. Hard to believe the difference when a scary virus can do. Let's hope the virus plays itself out soon as it doesn't appear there will be any type of vaccine available for at least 1 year.Greece is not the only country affected. Here in the US schools are closed, sports and other events postponed, people are told to avoid crowds or stay home if they don't have to go out.This is like some Science Fiction movie where a strange biological entity invades the earth, except this is not science fiction."
where would the travelers be quarantined - does any one know? tks
">where would the travelers be quarantined - does any one know? tks<In their homes. Since we are talking about LOCALS returning homes.Only severely mentaly chalenged people would do ""tourism"" in anyplace in the world now.So I guess these loonies will be quarantined in the Greek psychiatric hospitals"
so locals will be quarantined at home. Same as here (Australia).What about the overseas tourists/ visitors? thank you again...
">What about the overseas tourists/ visitors?<Same thing,but the borders will close soon for EU anyhow,maybe even today"
"What about the overseas tourists/ visitors? Anna you will most likely be quarantined for 14 days in Dubai or.Qatar or Abu Dahbi because thats as far as you will get cause there is no way they going to let you go via Singapore . So 14 days in The Middle East then 14 days when they send you back form there to OZ so 28 days and thats if they let you out of the Middle East So just stay at home it will be cheaper safer for every one and better for you. Try again next year.Good luck.Edited: 5:10 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Thank you Elenakotronaki the problem i have now is that we were to be in Crete on the 12 of May coming from Germany then off to Ioannina and then Kalampaka and ending in Athens over a month in Greece . I just cant press the cancel button on the computer I know I have to but just cant ,My niece is in Crete now from Australia she is a doctor I want ask her what to do and I know what she will say. .Any way good luck . Spirits up ."
All non EU citizens banned from entering Greece.All persons arriving from the UK will be treated as persons that are already infected (due to the total failure of the British government to control the Pandemic)
