"I recently took a 5-day backpack trip down the Paria River Canyon, from White House trailhead just north of the Arizona-Utah line near Highway 89, down to Lees Ferry. It's 38 miles in all, and we took 5 days to do it (May 20-24, 2012). It can be done faster--some do it in 2, others take a week. But you'll want to take your time, in what is perhaps the most spectacular backpack trip on the Colorado Plateau. Along the way, my friend Chuck and I took side trips into Buckskin Gulch, up Wrather Canyon (to see magnificent Wrather Arch), and through an abandoned meander of the Paria. You'll need a sturdy pair of water shoes for this one, as your feet are wet for all but the first few miles of the trip. But springs are plentiful, as is shade for the first two thirds of the trip. The last 13 miles though, are in the direct sun. Be prepared, and you'll have a great time.Rather than say more here, here's a link to about a 100 photos from the trip. They are annotated if you want to know more about what you're looking at:http://www.flickr.com/photos/65053204@N03/sets/72157630069152712/For those who want to see the complete4 set of nearly 500 photos, here's a link to those...http://www.flickr.com/photos/65053204@N03/sets/72157630007066461/It's a great trip, well worth doing... But it does require a permit, and they go quickly. The best and most popular time to go is May, and maybe into the first week of June. Before that, a little chilly, after that, a little warm. Plus the monsoon kicks in in July, and you don't want to be caught in the upper half of this canyon in a flash flood...Enjoy!"

"I just completed a trip report from my recent trip through Utah. My husband and I traveled 20 days with a 5th wheel trailer and 2 big dogs. We averaged 450 pictures per day with our digital cameras. We unloaded the pictures into our laptop computer each night and watched a slideshow of our day. Too much fun! We did a lot of hiking and saw some of the most remarkable sites and scenery. We know that it's more difficult to travel with dogs, but these are our ""kids"" and we don't like to go anywhere without them. With a lot of good pre-planning, you can have a great trip with your pets included. We made sure we knew where the nearest animal clinic was to each of our destinations, and we had back-up locations for boarding them in case the weather was too hot to leave them in the truck. They were wonderful travel companions and I think they hated coming home almost as much as we did! I have an album of photographs posted on my Facebook page.

Trip to Bryce Canyon National Park including Mossy Cave and Kodachrome Park…wordpress.com/2013/…Trip dates are March 16 - March 18 2013.
"Seeing Mossy Cave with icicles is indeed really special - a real treat. I'd only say that actually hiking into the main amphitheater at Bryce, even if briefly, is an whole different experience well worth the slight effort. Yes, the viewpoints are spectacular and all, but descending in between the hoodoos and other formations is something else again for sure! I can never be at Bryce and not walk one of the trails. It's just so special."

"Zion's Subway HikeWhile not exactly a universal travel plan on the southern Utah or Southwest US circuit, this trip report does cover one of the increasingly sought after hikes in Zion NP, namely ""The Subway"" or the Left Fork of North Creek. This hike is located in the Kolob portion of Zion NP, which is designated as wilderness or backcountry. As with a lot of backcountry wilderness exploration, a permit is required to hike this drainage, and is limited to 80 people per day at the time of this posting.There are several good online accounts of this hike, so here is another. Perhaps it can be of assistance to someone when planning some adventure in an excellent park>> tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g143057-i1449-k7245…"

Hoping it won't be too cold to hike.Want to avoid long drives to and from airports. Wondering if anyone has done anything like this.1. Fly into Grand Junction (from Portland, OR) and rent car.2. Drive to Moab and stay there 2-3 days to see Arches and Canyonlands.3. Drive all day to Zion but see Bryce and ??? on the way.4. Stay 3-4 days exploring Zion area.5.

"We spent a long weekend - Veteran's Day weekend - to visit Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. We flew into Salt Lake City (as it was cheaper) and started our drive to Bryce the first thing in the next morning. Passing through Route 12 was a very short scenic drive to Bryce Town through the Red Canyon. Our first stop viewpoint was Sunrise Point at 8015 feet above sea level. The small parking lot was pretty empty, I was surprised by not many people visiting the park even though it was a long weekend. The temperature was perfect for hiking in the 60s. It took our breathe away both the view and the hike up at high elevation! I had been to Grand Canyon, Arches, and Canyonland and this was my first time I have seen the hoodoos! We decided to hike down on the Queens Garden Trail and it was so worth the hike up afterward! We were able to get close to the hoodoos and the colorful rock formations, the landscape was so picturesque that I took literally hundreds of photos just in one day!For lunch, we drove to The Lodge at Bryce Canyon but it was closed for the season already! The only thing we found open nearby was the General Store; we ended up having hot dogs and a cup of chili and cost us $15.01!!!After lunch, we drove to Inspiration Point, once again no problem finding parking, and walked around the Rim Trail for different perspectives. Next, we went to Bryce Point - one of the famous hoodoo: The Hunter but the view was partially blocked. When we reached Rainbow Point, it was already in the late afternoon that at this angle, the hoodoos were in shadow. Same thing in Black Birch Canyon. There were more stop points on the way but most of them are covered by trees blocking the views. In my opinion, once you passed Inspiration Point, the other viewpoints aren't as spectacular!We headed back to Sunset Point as the name indicated great for the sunset. It wasn’t sunset yet and we had time to do another hike, we decided to hike down the zig-zag road on the Navajo Loop Trail; there were a lot more people down there! The trail was well worth the effort and it wasn't too bad hiking the way back up. On the bottom, it looked like a slot canyon and offered very nice photo ops! When we got up, many photographers were there and have set up their tripods to claim their spot for the sunset! We waited patiently and getting cold into the sunset….it wasn’t as spectacular as the sun wasn’t as strong and semi-covered by the clouds so not strong light reflected by the rocks.Right after the sunset, we went back to our car and made started our 2-hour drive to Springdale, where we stay for the night. Our day spent in Bryce was amazing, actually, I enjoyed Bryce more than Zion :) I posted the complete trip report with many photos here: missvacation.net/2018/…"

"I'm a little late in posting this but thanks to all who helped me plan this trip. After putting together our journal for this trip I realized I should have put this trip report into two different (or maybe 3) parts so those interested in Utah don't have to read about Colorade and vice versa. However for this time you need to just skip over those parts you might not be interested in. My journal is about a southwest trip we took including Mesa Verde, Monument Valley, and Moab area and includes lots of photos taken along the way. We took this trip in the fall of 2017, and were gone for a total of about 6 weeks, 4 weeks in Colorado and Utah. https:/…southwest-trip-september-2017.htmlEdited: 2 years ago "

"4 1/2 days in Moab: Arches & Canyonlands in November 2018. Here’s what we did with our four days. The weather was perfect. Low-to-mid 20s at dawn, but would warm up into the low 50s as the day went on. We flew into Grand Junction and took the scenic route into Moab along the Colorado. We varrived in Moab in time to head up to Delicate Arch for the sunset, which was terrific. Stayed for the rising moon and hiked back in the dusk. We had a wonderful dinner at LaSalle House and the next morning (Thursday) we hiked Devil’s Garden/the Primitive Trail. Some scrambling, but not too difficult, except when we mistakenly went off trail and had some tricky moments on the slickrock. We saw many arches along the way, and some on shorter hikes in the park . We drove out to Dead Horse State Park for an easy walk along the rim and the sunset. On Friday we went to Islands in the Sky. We didn’t try and wake up in time to see the sunrise at Mesa Arch, which I now regret a little. We hiked Murphy Point Trail and the White Rim Overlook. We then started down Lathrop trail, but the coming nightfall sent us back before we got down. If I could do it again, I’d have started with Lathrop (maybe after sunrise at Mesa). We watched the sunset, with some other shutterbugs, at the Green River Overlook. Saturday we did the Chesler Park Loop in Needles, starting from Elephant Hill and including the Joint. We followed other advice we’d gotten and hiked the loop counterclockwise and were glad we had. This hike was the highlight of the trip and one of the most beautiful I’ve done anywhere. After that we did some shorter hikes and stopped by Newspaper Rock on the way out as night was falling. Sunday we went back to Islands in the Sky and Upheaval Dome overlook, including the Aztec Buttes. We had lunch on the (busy) Grandview Trail and then back to Moab where we hiked to Corona and Bow Tie Arch. Sunset at Double Windows Arch. We had beautiful weather, almost no crowds (except Sunday at Grandview Trail). When we did Chesler Park in Needles, we started around 7:30 and didn’t see another person until well after noon.Wonderful trip. Strenuous but not overly difficult or technical for this 60 year old male."

"Thank you to all of the destination experts and locals who helped my wife and me to plan our 9 day Utah trip for August 2019 with our 6 year old daughter. We totally fell in love with Utah for its natural beauty and amazing people. Below is a trip report for the benefit of others, particularly those travelling with young children.Salt Lake City (3 nights):Temple Square - lovely tour of the gorgeous buildings and gardens, with very friendly sisters of the LDS Church. Tour was short and our 6 year old didn't get bored.Natural History Museum - amazing dinosaur collection; way better than the one in Manhattan. Spent almost 3 hours here and my daughter was hugely engaged and so very happy. Red Butte Gardens - very pretty gardens in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains. Highly photogenic and memorable. Quite a few bees (understandably) in some parts, which made me nervous because I am allergic. Copper Onion - terrific dinner here in the outdoor seating area.Overall we loved Salt Lake City both for its attractions and for its people. I feel compelled to note, however, that the number of drug addicts/panhandlers was extremely off putting and made me very uncomfortable walking around with our young daughter. Seemingly every street had a haggard meth or heroin addict acting erratically. I feel terribly bad for the less fortunate in general, but something absolutely must be done. No one hurt us but I was called a vulgar word for politely declining to give money to one of them, and my daughter was scared walking around. Not good.Moab (4 nights):Goblin Valley - visited as a detour from SLC to Moab, and totally loved it. Hoodoos were beautiful and photogenic, and this park is great for kids as they can actually climb (respectfully) on the rocks, unlike at a place like Bryce Canyon.Arches and Canyonlands (1 day each) - both were awe inspiring and get an A plus, plus.Adrift Adventure Tours - loved our half day float trip of the Fisher Towers area of the Colorado River. The tour was very well suited for a 6 year old, and the rapids were fun but mild and easy.Park City (2 nights):Price Dinosaur Museum - stopped en route from Moab. It was a nice 1 hour stop with some cool exhibits, but we found the natural history museum in Salt Lake City to be better.Bridal Veil Falls - gorgeous waterfall in Provo Canyon, which we visited for 30 minutes en route to Park City.Utah Olympic Park - awesome flying aces show; great hands on activities; and a surprisingly interesting museum that my wife and daughter (who don't like sports) thoroughly enjoyed.Again, we had an AMAZING time in Utah and this was one of our all time best trips. Thank you to everyone who helped us to plan this."

"The best of my Visit to the Zion National parkStarting with a hardcore Hike at Angels Landing, there were deaths on that tail, of people falling of the 1000 foot cliffs, don't get on that trail if you are afraid of heights and climbing steep walls with nothing but your bare hands.Followed by a strenuous Hike, and Rappelling at the Water Canyon, just outside of the park area, make sure to get dressed for water, and, have something to change once back in the car.The adventure ends with hiking up the virgin river, on the scenery Narrows trail, While walking on the winding canyon with water gashing all around, you would surely get wet, head to toe.Whenever hiking in slot canyons, make sure to get updated of the weather forecast for rain, and consult with the local guides for flush flood warningsSee the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F3Gur3Utbshttps:/…"

"I had often wondered when I'd roadtrip around Utah. I knew I would do it one day. And it turned out I ended up right where needed to be to do it. St. George is 2.5hrs from Las Vegas and the last major city you'll find before starting the loop. The fall is the ideal time with comfortable temps and crowd size. And you can catch some season foliage in sections.The first leg out of St. George is Zion, a quick one under an hour. But start very early, hiking by 6am, because you'll be moving on for your reservation in Antelope Valley. Plus you beat crowds and can grab sunrise. I went with Angels Landing trail for it's accomplishing view of the valley. Its the picture you most commonly see. What a view. What a hike. Plan to be driving away from the park by 11am. Its a little under 2hrs now to Lower Antelope Canyon for your 3pm reservation.If your on schedule you can make a view stop at Horseshoe Bend on the way. Then you'll arrive right in time for check-in at Kens or Dixies tour. This is hands down one of, if not thee, most visually stunning natural viewing walks you will ever have. Its incredible. The tour is finished within 2hrs so you'll have some daylight left for your last leg of the day. Kayenta is just 1.5hrs away and will be your much deserved stay for the evening. Get some rest. You're now positioned perfectly for an early morning to grab sunrise in Monument Valley.Up early and driving by 7am. Just 30min away and you'll pull up to one hell of a desert sunrise. The classic. As you pull away and head on there is a spiritual feeling in this area. No kidding. Its a privilege. And there's no doubt it has something to do with the native land you are being welcomed on. Anywho, your just cruisin now, enjoy. Your on your way to Moab. Although, just outside of Monument Valley there's some great little diners in Mexician Hat. Cuz you probably hadn't had breaky yet. From here its straight to Moab. Where CanyonLands is also but skipped with this itinerary.Little over 3hrs to your hike in Arches. The Delicate Arch is a great hike that drives you through the park to get to. And its really a hike for anyone. A beautiful view with a very relaxed vibe with others having lunch, drawing & painting etc. Cool spot. So at this point its late afternoon and you have a choice. You can stay in Moab and enjoy the great little town for the evening. Or you can make a little more ground 1hr up the road and stay in Green River. Either way get some rest.Another early rise for the next phase of the trip. From here you'll be jumping off the major Freeways. Exiting the 70 onto the 24 into Capital Reef then 12 into the Grand Staircase and onto Bryce. For the allotted time for my trip this section was a thoroughly enjoyed drive through. Its a fantastic drive. Capital Reef welcomes you in a beautiful winding drive through bright yellow foliage and contrasting red rock. Then you make it to the wide open beauty atop the Grand Staircase. A mesmerizing drive.Then after all that beauty you pull up around noon to the view of Bryce Canyon. Here I chose to do the the Peek-A-Boo Trail winding around in the canyons. It was a pleasure of a hike knowing it would be my last of the trip. I stayed that evening in Bryce and got back to St. George that next morning. I'll say this. Now having nearly accomplished The Mighty 5 drive, technically 4 skipping Canyonlands with the itinerary. Do the loop. Don't just add Bryce or Zion or Moab to an another road trip. The unmatched transitional beauty, that is both felt and seen, can only be experienced looping it all. And I promise you. You will be grateful for this drive.ProTip: You could perfectly add another day or two to view North Rim Grand Canyon in between Zion and Antelope. Keeping in mind it closes Oct 15th. And a camp stop in Capital Reef."
