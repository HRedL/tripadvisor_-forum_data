"We still have reservations to stay at AKL on 4/9 which is exactly two weeks from today. Just checked in with Disney reservations agents again to ask when they would be extending the closure but they are STILL staying that they are re-opening on 4/1. If Orange county has a ""stay at home"" order in effect until 4/9, how can Disney legally open on 4/1? We can cancel our reservation but purchased tickets to the ""Villains after hours"" at MK and I believe those tickets are non refundable. Is there something that I'm missing that Disney is dragging their feet?"
I doubt they are opening.....cancelled our trip for April 3rd.
"I agree. Can't imagine that they'll be open and running before mid April at least (probably later, but who knows...). In any event, I'm sure WDW will either refund anything you've paid, or (perhaps more likely) allow you to rebook sometime within a year or 2. Time will tell. I'd keep checking with them every couple of days. Sorry for the hassle. Onward & upward!"
"It is really weird, if you go to their calendar they show open for April 1st and a ticketed event April 2nd."
Customer service reps are only going to give you the official line which is they are only closed until the end of the month. I’m sure they will announce soon that they will remain closed. But i don’t believe they have decided on that date yet which is why no announcement.
"The current stay at home order does not expire until April 9 at 11:00pm. That assumes it is not extended.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-corona…See Section 7.Disney is closed and will remain so until t least that time.Osceola County has a similar order.Edited: 6:59 am, March 27, 2020 "
"In addition, the stay at home order specifically references theme parks to stay closed."
"Realistically, the way things are going, surely no theme parks will be open until a lot later in the year?"
Hi not same thing but we are having same virgin telling us our flights are still scheduled to fly in July but we are due to pay £5k by 20th April I know it’s unprecedented but it’s a lot of money to lose & they seem to not be very reassuring to refund it all depends on FCO but our travel insurance say we have to claim via airline. In light of USA picking up with more c virus like here it’s very hard to find out our options outcome if we pay in full. We don’t know to sacrifice our £500 deposit v £5k I think your problem is the differing answers responded good luck
I wouldn't go that far. We will have to wait and see.
"In the last half hour the Disney Parks News Twitter (an Offical WDW Public Affairs feed) announced both WDW & Disneyland are closed indefinitely. Employees are to be paid through April 18th. https://twitter.com/DisneyParksNewsEdited: 3:58 pm, March 27, 2020 "
Well that answers my question! I'm glad they announced it now and not two days before we were supposed to leave.
"Kelsum, Glad you can stop wondering now, you will be refunded. A sad time but start dreaming and planning for a future Holiday, the pandemic will end, perhaps Later rather then sooner but it will come to end"
That's a tricky one so hard to know what to do. My cruise on the 21st march got cancelled . But my flight didn't. It was diverted to Miami. I was forced to reschedule and just pick a date. I went with June.. wish I hadn't now. Good luck with your decision
