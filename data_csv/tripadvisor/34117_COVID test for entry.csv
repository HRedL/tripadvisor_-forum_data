"I posted this on the French Polynesia forum also... The COVID test requirements are similarAny help or suggestions is appreciated.Hi,Our original trip was planned for NZ, who knows when that will happen.So we're looking into Tahiti.Does anyone have any details on how to qualify for a COVID test AND get a 72 hour turnaround (this is the same as travel to Alaska)I live in Utah, USA and they are only allowing sick people that need medical attention to get tests and the turn around on those tests is 5-7 days.I have a couple inquiries in with private labs to see if we could get a rapid test.Any help is much appreciated"
"When?Did you try here: https:/â€¦1Find out *exactly* what type of test they are doing and turnaround time. Tahiti requires ""A SARS-CoV-2 virus genome test (the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test)""If that doesn't work, contact your doctor, pharmacist, medical facilities, etc.Depending where you live, try a neighboring state. Or choose another destination for this year's holiday."
"thanks so much for that link. How did you find that?! I've contacted testutah...the health department... nothing was provided, other than ""only sick people, those are the rules"".Also, thanks for the specific test.Cheers"
"""How did you find that?! ""Google. :)Another idea: contact a couple of travel agents who arrange trips to Tahiti or Alaska.Edited: 3:57 pm, June 23, 2020 "
