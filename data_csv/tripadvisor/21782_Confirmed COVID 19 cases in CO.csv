"Yes, wash hands, especially fingertips. Our son teaches English in China. I think they have a better handle on it than here in the US.Fear of fear is the real issue. We just got back from Puerta Vallarta. One day they had 3 cruise ships (petri dishes) at port. It doesn't really affect you ...until it does.Wash hands, keep your hands away from your face (tell that to preschoolers) and we should all be just fine! Hope this is all over with and we can all ho about our lives as usual.Colorado gives us some respite from "" the world's problems "".Get out there, enjoy nature but be mindful of those facing (not so great ) situations with family members. Oh...& if you didn't stock up on toilet paper...(what's up with the toilet paper selling out in 4 minutes at Costco?)Edited: 7:20 pm, March 06, 2020 "

Another tip - wash your phone. It's something we lay down on many surfaces and then put next to our face. Wipe it down often. We now have 8 confirmed cases here in CO.https:/…BREAKING--568535251.html

"The link that fv gave is a solid one to use. It shows which counties are the current hot spots. If you are not sure which county you will be traveling to please do some online research. Here are some famous ones to get you started. Aspen is in Pitkin county, which is the current hot spot due to a number of infected international travelers. Vail and Beaver Creek are in Eagle county. Breckenridge, Frisco, and Keystone are in Summit county. Telluride is in San Miguel county. Crested Butte is in Gunnison county. Colorado Springs is in El Paso county. Steamboat Springs is in Routt county.So, you must decide on your own how safe you feel traveling here. Please be aware that many of these ski areas have limited medical facilities and some are far from major cities."
I just received emails from Hilton and Marriott concerning their changes in policies due to the virus. If you have booked non-refundable lodging I would suggest checking to see if they are allowing cancellation without fees due to the virus outbreaks.

"Yesterday at a press conference, Gov. Polis requested that people over 60 or those with underlying health issues avoid traveling to mountain communities. He said this was not only because of the increased risk of community spread, but also because many mountain communities lack the medical facilities to deal with the coronavirus or to deal with large numbers of patients.See various news reports from the Vail Daily, Aspen Times and Summit Daily at this topic.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28927…"
"Hmmmm....wonder how many people will comply. Western State in Gunnison just canceled classes for the rest of the year, with 3 new confirmed cases.I'm guessing more people will be headed to the mountains, thinking fresh air will do them good. At the Hot Springs @ Mt Princeton this morning there were around 50 people. A few were on spring break. Two of the couples we spoke with were told not to come back after their break.Mainly, for the general population it's going to be a major inconvenience.We'll get through this eventually, but it's going to be a bumpy ride."
The count is now 72 presumptive cases.https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/news/…
The count is now around 200.
363 cases today
475 cases now and 4 deaths.
"Maybe it's just me, but I don't see the need for daily updates on the # of cases and deaths. We have the links to the sites for that information - they have been provided several times."

"SusieLou, since the primary focus of your replies #17 and #18 is the Grand Junction/Fruita/Mesa County area, those replies would be more meaningful if posted in a topic on the Grand Junction and Fruita forums."
Confirmed cases is meaningless now as the spread is far and wide. I started the thread originally to make sure that spring breakers knew what they were getting into. It is everywhere at this point. The stat next will be deaths.
If folks want a daily update that lists by county then this is a reliable source - the state's health dept. data. Has some interesting charts and graphs detailing ages also.https://covid19.colorado.gov/case-data
"Colorado's number of coronavirus cases rose to 1,734 on Friday, though Polis has emphasized there are likely thousands of more unidentified cases in the state. The number of deaths rose to 31, up from 24 through Thursday. About 11,000 people have been tested for the virus in Colorado.This from the Governor Friday afternoon.The link to the state website I gave in the above posting is not being kept up to date it seems. I'm posting this because it seems folks are not getting the idea that staying at home is important. Perhaps they need to see that we have way more cases than states around us. NM - 191. UT - 480, WY - 353, KS - 202. Very low numbers. So some folks from other areas are not realizing how big the numbers are here. I even had one person tell me this virus is no big deal and she will host non-family visitors and do some travel plans with them. This is not the time to do that.A good friend was just hospitalized here with suspected coronavirus - in the high risk group. So I'm taking this on as a personal request. As another friend said, ""Don't kill my family and friends.""Edited: 11:49 am, March 28, 2020 "
"SusieLou, the information in the link you gave in reply #21 is updated around 4 pm each day. Sometimes, it is a little after 4 pm before the information is updated. The numbers shown are from the previous day. As explained on that link, ""This reporting gap gives our epidemiologists time to review the data and improve the accuracy.""If you click on that link now, the information shows the same numbers you posted in reply #22. Those numbers will be updated around 4 pm today."
"Thanks, I see the update."
"Susie Lou, have you looked at the populations of the states you just mentioned.Kansas and Utah are only half the population of Colorado.Wyoming and NM relatively small populations. Really can't compare ourselves to ""neighboring"" states. LolObviously the bigger the city, the tighter the living quarters. The one county I found interesting was Eagle. Perhaps they are testing more people? The one article I read, said they were prepared with ventilators and such. I think they were the first ones to get hit with international skiers?So sorry to hear about your friend. It's crazy how fast this virus spreads. Hopefully one day this will be behind us."
"I'm in Eagle County and we only have 29 ventilators at our hospital and 56 beds, that's what was most recently shared. Testing is hit or miss here and results are taking 7+days. We are a small community and keep losing members of it, the assumption is that we are all infected, some with symptoms, some without. Pitkin County had 2 deaths that were found upon welfare checks, so keep and eye out for your neighbors and check in from a safe distance."
We had the burton us open the first week in march at vail. Big crowds. International crowds. Some of the first known cases were restaurant and hotel workers. And lots of those people live in tight quarters. Eagle and Pitkin counties both are hit pretty hard. Lost an aquaintance yesterday in his late 40s
So sorry to hear that Keith.
