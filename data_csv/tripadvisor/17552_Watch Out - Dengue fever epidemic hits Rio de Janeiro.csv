"Apparently dengue fever is hitting HARD in Rio these days - the situation is out of control :[i]RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - An outburst of dengue has killed at least 47 people — and perhaps twice that — in Rio de Janeiro state this year, officials said Thursday, announcing a hot spot in a hemispheric outbreak that sickened nearly 1 million people in 2007.[b]State officials said 51 cases are being reported every hour as the outbreak strains public hospitals’ capacity.[/b]“What we see today in Rio de Janeiro is a catastrophe,” said Edmilson Migovski, a professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “The death toll is rising because the virus is becoming more virulent, and at the same time people who were infected once are getting infected again.” Brazil had more than half of the 900,782 cases of dengue in the Americas last year, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Of the hemisphere’s 317 deaths, 158 came in Brazil, including 31 in Rio state.But while federal officials say overall numbers were down in early 2008, they have jumped in Rio state. State officials say dengue has already killed 47 people, and is suspected of killing another 49 whose deaths are under investigation. The state, which has 16 million inhabitants, has seen more than 32,000 dengue cases this year, officials said.“I am treating it as an epidemic because the number of cases is extremely high,” state Health Secretary Sergio Cortes said.Migovski told The Associated Press that the problem may actually be worse: “An emergency room doctor who has to attend 40 or 50 patients in a morning is not going to be able to inform officials about all the cases.”Health officials across the Americas are trying to coordinate their fight against dengue, which has steadily gained strength since the early 1980s. Known as “bonebreak fever,” dengue is spread by the Aegis aegypti mosquito and can incapacitate patients for over a week with severe headaches and joint pains.A deadly hemorrhagic variant that causes internal and external bleeding accounts for fewer than 5 percent of cases but has shown signs of growing — often affecting people who have recovered from a less-severe form. Experts fear the virus could grow deadlier and more widespread, in part because tourism and migration are circulating four different strains across the Americas.Federal Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao said Rio may be seeing more dengue cases because state and city officials have failed to heed warnings on a growing problem. Rio de Janeiro Doctor’s Union this week urged prosecutors to charge city officials with criminal negligence.Officials fight dengue by spraying insecticides and eliminating puddles of standing water where mosquitoes can breed — in the crevices of old buildings, on rooftops, inside used tires, in vacant lots and at garbage dumps.[/i]http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23736088/"
"There is no need to scare people, those who don't know much about Brazil in particular....esp. a warning by a person who has never posted before on any topic in the Brazil forum. (and therefore I am moved to reply ... in the same way....)Realize that ""Officials fight dengue by spraying insecticides and eliminating puddles of standing water where mosquitoes can breed"" and this is being done. Tourist and more upper class areas may not have so much of a problem with dirty conditions and standing water as poor and rural areas.Many of the deaths are because of the overwhelmed public hospitals in the free SUS network for those who don't have a private health care insurance plan, where people have died waiting in line to be seen according to reports on Globo.It is very easy to blame the current government, but any system, including public health, was not formed overnight and cannot be reformed overnight. There is always government infighting.Wearing repellent during the day should help discourage bites.A tourist should of course be aware of the symptoms----and would go to a private hospital and pay for proper and timely care, minimizing the risk. "
Oh that explains why I got a cheap flight for next week
" this is a very valid piece of information. like all the issues of safety discussed on this forum, this, too, needs to be taken seriously. learn as much as you can before you go. it is something that is happening in and around Rio as we discuss this issue. this truely fits the T/A motto... get the truth, then go."
Great! Of course this is bad for the millions who have to live around the threat of this disease but my trip is now 2 1/2 months away. Not a good thing to look forward to. Guess I'll be wearing alot of mosquito repellant.
I think this is a very important piece of information for tourists coming to Rio - I'm not telling people to cancel their visits AT ALL ! Using a good repellent is a nice way to avoid this mosquito and stay healthy in your trip . All I want is that tourists enjoys this brilliant city with no further concerns - I guess 'd be terrible for anyone to find out as soon as arrival that there's an outburst of something and doesn't know what to do 'cause no one told him !
"""Tourist and more upper class areas may not have so much of a problem ""Barra, ""the"" upper class area in Rio is completly infected."
"I leave for Rio in 2 weeks (yes I have started to count down). Does anyone know how bad this really is? From what I've looked into, it seems like the standard precautions (mosquito nets, DEET) should be sufficient. We will also be in Buzios and Paraty. Are those areas affected also?"
Dengue mosquitos are active during the day. Repellent helps. Mosquito nets may be a little bit ineffective while walking around town as a tourist.
"Hmmm, but it sure would look interesting. I meant mosquito nets for when I go to sleep. And I thought mosquitos were most active at dusk and dawn."

its something created by media...i live here and i never got this dengue thing...my family neither.i know only one person who got dengue.take it easy.Brazil Rio
"Brazil_Rio's post borders criminal. Even the Federal Government had aknowledged the epidemic and promised to send the army to combat it (I wonder if they will shot the mosquitos or bomb them, but anyway).The secretary of health (state level) apologized for it and promised .... bla, bla, bla."
"Brazil Rio is one of many cariocas who think that the media is unfair to his city and invent problems that don't exist ..please , even the local government right now recognized - very late for sure - that the situation is very serious . "
The article refers to the state of Rio not the city of Rio. Is this equally a problem in the city and in the country? Thanks.
"Till March,12th: 33 deaths in Rio state, being 19 in the city. Dengue is not a problem all over the country, but in some states it is."
come on guys go put your epidemic phobia in another website i never had dengue before... zona sul rio doesnt have almost no dengue at all travelers dont pay attention do that just enjoy your vacation of a lifetime....
also dengue is not contagious ... you can only get dengue for one specie of mosquito and brazil have about 9 thousand diferent species ....
"So now you all know, dengue is not a problem at all!Since neither Brasil_Rio nor TravellKing2008 got, and this TWO, I repeat TWO! out of 6 million people, it's a real prove that dengue is a mith.P.S. I don't think many dengue infected people will bother to write here, not to mention the dead ones."
You sound well miffed off 
"TravelKing, I'm not sure why you'd write something like this. Although I didn't notice mosquitoes in zona sul either, not all tourists stay there the whole time. Besides, tourists should just remember to wear insect repellent. I don't think anyone is advising you to stay away from Rio.reuters.com/article/…idUSN24343607"
"As mentioned before, many of the deaths that have occurred were due to DELAYED treatment in public hospitals. Those who understand what the symptoms are and PAY for prompt private treament are not likely to suffer this fate. (just one more sad illustration of the inequalities in this country)"
"Not at all GaryEastYorks. As I already said a few times here I'm brazilian but I don't work for the oficial tourism bureau, and I'm here to try to help, the same way I expect to be helped when I look for information about my planned trips. If everybody start acting like some people who try to convince that his city is paradise on earth, with no problems whatsoever, this forum can be closed as we would become just another ad site. And now for the latest news on the issue:Brazil is sending at least 600 health professionals to help hospitals in Rio de Janeiro state that have been overwhelmed by an outbreak of dengue fever.In addition, hundreds more workers are being deployed to combat the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the disease. They will be spraying insecticides and looking for puddles of standing water where the mosquito usually breeds.Forty-nine people have died of dengue fever in Rio de Janeiro state so far this year, while 33,000 have been made ill. Victims are generally incapacitated by severe headaches, muscle and joint pain. There is no vaccine for dengue and treatment is usually limited to rest and fluids. "
"Gary, you are totally correct...Jealous... It's what this is about...it's an old issue that Rio is Brazil!What all the world want to see? São Paulo?i don't think so...take a look at the location of the commentors at ths topic...They don't even live here!why are they talking so bad about Rio and with this sureness?Come to Rio and Take it easy.there's no this dengue things here... except if you are crazy enough to visit favelas, baixada fluminense, etc.concerned at all?try a insect repelent and be free.Brazil Rio"
"Jealously of Rio is understandable, but downplaying 49 deaths is not...Obviously there's a significant problem with dengue fever and I for one appreciate knowing what's going on down in Rio (good and in this case, bad) and I'm certain other tourists venturing to Rio would appreciate knowing of this risk (however slight) before going, than venturing to Rio uninformed."
" my wife and i live Piari. her(our) 20 year old son, who is very fit... a 2nd degree black belt in karate... has just become sick with what could be symtoms of dengue. make no mistake about what is happening in and around Rio. this is real. my personal opinion... keep the brasilian machismo to a minimum and deal with the FACTS."
I did not mean to cause any conflict and I would like to apologise if I did. I am very interested to read any information about Rio de Janeiro as I spend a lot of time there at my holiday home not far away. I will be there in a few days and I am a little concerned about dengue fever so I have a Q - Am I right in thinking there is nothing we can do to protect oursevles apart from using repellants during the day? 
Gary... you can kill the mosquitoes...it's a funny game!i used to kill a lot of them(not in Rio city where it's difficult to me see some mosquito) at night. I am enemy of all kind of mosquitoes and flies.i recently bought an interesting electric swatter... you need to hit the damn mosquitoes with it to kill them... but they are killed by a high powered electric shock instead my old shoe.Be WelcomeBrazil Rio
"""I did not mean to cause any conflict and I would like to apologise if I did.""Never Mind, you didn't.""Jealous... It's what this is about...""No it isn't.""What all the world want to see? São Paulo?i don't think so...""So ?????""They don't even live here!why are they talking so bad about Rio and with this sureness?""a) because it's that badb) because we can read""there's no this dengue things here... ""So what you're saying is that all the kids names the Jornal Nacional (the most important TV news program in Brazil) broadcasted yesterday were fake?

BFG,""... but downplaying 49 deaths is not...""And counting, unfortunatly""Obviously there's a significant problem with dengue fever""Not for everyone."" and I for one appreciate knowing what's going on down in Rio (good and in this case, bad) and I'm certain other tourists venturing to Rio would appreciate knowing of this risk""You are 100% right. And this is what I think forums like this one are all about. Lies and propaganda we can find in many other places."
"I have one of those zapper bats, they are great fun ... for a while"
"I will be going to Rio with embratur again in June lets see if they will address this as a notable problem that is being solved or they sweep it under the rug like when they have crime outbursts or sweeps of the beaches that directly effects my travel customers going to Brazil and Rio in general. I have worked years trying to calm down travellers and agents that stay guarded about traveling ro Rio the city I love for one reason or another. Dengue is serious and ignoring it in tourism could be a fatal mistake. You know our state department in the US has already posted warnings, if they have a vaccine or in the future have something to prevent it we could deal. scary. I'll post back after we see haw its handled? Health issue first, tourist issue for me 4 sure. cheers!"
It seems that this should be taken very seriously- I will take all precautions possible but nothing will keep me from my first trip to Rio which is now only 35 days from now. 
" mikebrasil, google dengue. there are over 90 current articles listed."
"54, and counting unfortunatly.As I type I'm listening Rio's mayor talking to rede Globo what he'll do to combat the dengue that according to some doesn't exist."
"Yeah, I read them, it's a cycle that always has to be played out. The positive thing is it's a ""cycle"" meaning it will end. I can't imagine being a politician in that case. Imagine having a epidemic that has no shot to cure or prevent, like malaria for instance, you have to warn people that if they get sick they may have this disease, most people treated early survive easily and convelesce, it's mostly poor people that dont know thay have been bitten, dont get help, that eventual are at risk to not survive.Thanks guys for this interesting dialogue. I hope the cycle ends sooner then later. "
"I don't understand, if there is no specific treatment for dengue why does it matter if we are rich or poor? From what I have read its a case of get lots of rest and drink lots of fluids."
"The reality is... Most of the Poor people in Rio, especially in the fevela don’t check checked on, unless they come out and down to the hospital. Most just don’t even know that’s what they have, think it's the flu and don’t drink enough or treat the symptoms. Most unfortunate but its the truth. Just watched sicko again and they claim people in El Salvador have a lower infant mortality rate then america, so we can't cliam to be any better."
"GaryEastYorks--If you have money in Brazil, you can buy private health insurance to see doctors and specialists. In some (many/most) hospitals, private patients have separate clinics with better equipment. Private patients are seen in a timely manner because there are more doctors per capita. You may be more likely to read or listen to the news and to be better educated about caring for your health.Poor people in Brazil depend on the SUS public health system. There are always long waits for appointments and long lines on arrival. Staff is short, as is equipment, and everyone is overworked.In general, any kind of public health announcements are not as frequent or widespread as in the U.S. or perhaps elsewhere. Some of the working poor may be forced to leave a child pretty much on his/her own during the 6-day work week while the parent is at a live-in job, so may not be aware of conditions on a day-to-day basis.So, as mike said, if you think you just have the flu or something, by the time you make an appointment and are finally in line to see the doctor in a SUS hospital because whatever it is hasn't gone away, you could actually die in the line, as has happened recently."
"Ok but what are they waiting in line for? what is the treatment? what am i missing? thats what I don't understand, sorry if i'm being thick."
" people are in line because, after a period of time, they realize that what ever they are feeling is more than the flu. unfortunatly, for many , this is almost too late. several have been reported to have died in these long line. the government is supposedly setting up 3-4 hundred medical tents througgout the city to aliviate to long lines. there is nothing medical that can be done for or prevent dengue. the treatment consists of large quanties of liquid intake and rest. even this can be a problem in the favelas. as long as the winds stay blowing off the ocean, most of the mosquitos will not make it to the beaches or rio central. if the winds blow from the north-northwest, there will be mosquitos at the beaches.  the best caution one can do is apply mosquito repelent. also, dengue has a 10 day incubation period. this is why very few tourist have reported any problems while in Rio. when people return home, most assume they have the flu"
"Great point... Pointloman. Maybe our clients will be a little more assured if they know that. Many clients especially from NY decide on a whim if they are going or avoiding when seeing these types of warnings. Good ammo for convincing travelers that it's not as serious at the beach and the 10 -day incubation period. But once your bitten say if in Rio for only 3 days, doesnt it still incubate as you move on for the rest of teh period? just thinking out load.thanks "
