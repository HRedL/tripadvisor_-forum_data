"Hi,This may sound like a silly question and maybe I’m worrying about nothing, but is Disneyland Paris safe at the moment regarding the outbreak of the coronavirus in places like Italy etc? Thank you for any answers."
If we knew the answers to these questions we would be quitting our day jobs and making mad bank as public health consultants.All you can do is monitor your own government's travel advisories. Nobody on here knows anything the authorities do not.
We've just got back and I honestly didn't worry about it at all while I was there - I just made sure to keep up with hand washing and using anti-bac before eating etc..
Right now I would not worry about going as there is no oubreak in France but you never know what will happen in the coming weeks. Nobody knows whether the virus will spread more so there is not much anyone can do except following the situtation and decide whether one is comfortable about going.
We are going in 5 weeks so will be monitoring the situation. Definitely a concern that it is a neighbouring country to Italy. The French official were meeting this morning to put plans in place incase of any further cases in France. But at presant only 1 died the others were treated and released from hospital and only 1 remains in hospital but is recovering
"Presently I dont see anything in the media or the department of travel saying France or Paris is cause for concern. DLP always carries more than an average risk for contagion due to the high number of visitors and confines of queues etc so as always I'd suggest those travelling with those who are immunocompromised to take due care. Washing hands, using hand gel, covering mouth when sneezing or coughing etc. There are regularly tales of dlp belly (norovirus) but all you can do is be careful"
"It doesn’t sound silly because I am also worrying about the same thing, we are due to go for a five night stay on 29th March. Hopefully it will be ok!"
My daughter has just told me she doesn't want to go and could we change it until later in the year.A local school has kids just back from nothren Italy and has freaked her out abit I think. Also there is a rugby match on next week I think that is likely to be cancelled too. Its all over the news here and we don't have a confirmed case here Yet!!!
"We’ve decided not to go for the time being as the virus seems to still be spreading in many parts of Europe and not a day goes by where there aren’t more cases being reported or written about in the news. Will be just trying to keep up to date with the situation and just see what happens before booking perhaps a bit later on in the year, assuming it doesn’t become even worse."
"I'm due to go in 2 weeks with a 6 and 1 year old. I dont think it's a silly question it's been on my mind for a little while and with confirmation at present of cases and a death I'm feeling v worried because of how fast it has spread in a couple of months.I could cancel our plans, I'll just bite the bullet and lose the money as its non refundable. I'm going to follow the news on it. If we do decide to got lots of alcohol gel and washing hands!"
"We are booked in Mid March. Monitoring the situation closely.Disneyland Tokyo is open despite 170+ cases in the country so I expect DLP will remain open too, unless the situation changes. I booked a package with Disneyland.fr, so going to see if its possible to change dates. (If anyone has good experiences doing this, pls let me know!) and then will make a call in a weeks time.Hoping for the best but watching what's going on and thinking of your family's health is paramount. My kids will be gutted if we have to cancel, and we have booked other days in Paris for ourselves.If you hadn't already booked, ask yourself would you book to go now? I think the next few days and weeks may see the situation decided one way or another. Good luck all, and it is a good and responsible question."
We are going on Monday and tbh I am not worrying about it. It's like the swine flu and ebola panic all over and. normal flu kills way more people every year but that doesn't get published.Just getting some hand gel etc and keep washing our hands.
We are booked to go at the end of July and are just keeping an eye on things at the moment.We made sure we have insurance in case of any cancellation and just have to see what the official government advice is at the time.As others have said just keep washing hands etc and keep hygiene standards up and if your fit and well you should be fine and should only get flu like symptoms if you are unfortunate enough to catch it.Hopefully it will be kept under control and contained as we all have nothing to worry about :)
"We went there as a family last week and there were a lot of Chinese tourists. I am waiting for my doctor to call me back for tests because since Monday I have developed a fever and flu-like symptoms yet, as far as I know, I haven't been around anyone who's been ill. Because of the current outbreak popping up in places around the globe I would be very cautious. I will update this post on my circumstances as soon as I find anything out, fingers crossed it is just a common cold.Edited: 5:05 am, February 26, 2020 "
Emmac fingers crossed for you
"Not silly at all. Even if france still low key, DLP is such a crowded space. I have been considering same. We had been due to book for Easter holidays weeks ago but got delayed. I have been watching it spread across Europe and decided last night not tp book and plan for next year instead. Ours are only little 3 and 5 and id feel terrible if they caught it. Ours still place their mouths on things like ride handle so no amount of handwashing would save us. If i had booked and paid id be in a predicament now. Going to go price somewhere overpriced in ireland instead as it hasnt hit here, yet. Im probably being overly cautious and Im sure anyone booked to go will be fine."
"We are booked for Easter holidays, we have until next week make a free amendment on our hotel. 14yr old doesn't want to go, she is already planning Dec trip instead to Marvel hotel and Buzz will be reopen then lol.She has an underlining health condition too so we will likely cancel. Its not just a fear of her catching it, it's also the risk of been quarantine for 2 weeks ect."
I don’t feel there’s a need for the harshness displayed in post 1 - it’s a relevant question.I’m due to go in March and have no plans to cancel.
Hi everyone I was watching a segment on tv yesterday and as no country has advised against flying to the travel companies won’t refund any holidays and neither will your insurance provider so if you decide to make any amendments or cancellations the cost will have to be covered by yourselves
"I was going to book a trip this week for later in the year, but given the situation i've decided to hold off booking until things stabilise. It seems to be spreading in europe at the present time, however it remains to be seen if this is just a blip or a trend, however, given the international nature of DLP, and with a member of our party with an underlying health issue i don;t think for us, at this time, booking is a good idea. Hope everybody that does go has a great time and stays safe and healthy."
NO question this virus will spread all over Europe...another death in France today ...new cases including Greece etc. It will move across Europe. While not as bad a a cruise ship or airplane Disney is a crowded place and does get people from all over...not sure now but usually many from China. I guess just watch and wait and see where your comfort level is...mine is avoiding crowded places if at all possible.
Yeah I felt that was a bit harsh too. It'd be strange if you didnt worry. It's a packed out place with people from all over the world. A very valid question
"We've just returned from DLP and I was also concerned about this. I purchased masks for each of us and took them with us, along with alcohol gel and washed hands a lot. We only saw 1 person wearing a mask in 2 days and we didn't feel we were in close proximity to anyone we didnt know (<6ft) to warrant wearing the masks. It's best to be over prepared than to be in trouble if they are needed."
"Bjr je suis actuellement enceinte et nous devons aller à desneyland ce week-end, que pensez vous de cela il y a t il bcp de touristes?"
"Hi Alisha,I don’t think this is a silly question at all- I too have concerns.We are travelling with our 5yo in April, and with the developments in mainland Europe changing every day, I think it’s right you should be thinking about this.To start, check you have Atol protection, should Disneyland close, they should be able to reimburse you.Regards govt guidance at the time you travel, if the narrative is along the lines of ‘restrict none essential travel’ I think tour operators have a duty of care to reimburse us.Hopefully, all will be ok and our trips won’t be affected. However, I will have our anti viral masks and hand sanitizer with us at all times.I’ll also be restricting the places where we eat, just in case!! Good luck- safe travels.Victoria"
"We are in the same boat as you, off to Disney for 9th March for a few days, two young children with us.We are comfortable visiting Disney at the moment but will wear gloves and wash hands a lot more than usual.One thing we're certain on, if Disney has any cases of Coronavirus, they will quick to shut down, the Asian parks have done it and Disney can't afford to have any negative press, so if they get one case, they'll likely close down the parks for a deep clean or just for a sustained period.So as long as they stay open, we are fine with travelling (Eurostar).Saying all that, you can catch it anywhere, at any time."
"My family and I are also unsure if we should keep our travels plans to Paris as we are due to run the Paris Marathon in early April. I am seriously thinking about cancelling though as the virus seems to be spreading rapidly and they don’t seem to have it contained. There has however been no indication as yet that the Marathon will be cancelled as they have done with the Tokyo Marathon, but keeping a close eye as the next few weeks are critical"
"We leave from the US to Paris on March 7th, 2020 and will be there for a week. We aren’t cancelling our plans. We are going to Disneyland Paris on March 11th. If there is some government mandate, we would of course follow it. But we aren’t going to change plans for disease or terrorism, etc... The chance of dying in a car accident is far greater in the US, and I don’t let that affect how often I drive. Hope that doesn’t sound like I am “mocking” your concern, just trying to place it in perspective for our decision."
We travel on the 12th March if travel is still allowed we are still going. We will just take necesssary precautions.
"Yes we are going on 8th March for a few days. Concerned and things will change for sure, but as long as the park stays open and the UK Government says it is ok to travel, we will still go. Insurance won't cover us if we cancel"
"Hi all,We’re leaving on Wednesday for 5 nights...Between the crap weather and Coronavirus I do wish I’d booked a different time of year for my family to go! But cancelling and losing thousands of pounds (don’t bet on your insurance because until Disney closes, they won’t refund it) seems an over reaction to me.One thing the press need to be called out on is scare mongering. There are more people that sadly die every year to Flu, than Coronavirus, the statistics show this virus to be as deadly as normal Flu, & the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable same as normal Flu.Would you cancel your plans to go to Disney if someone was diagnosed with Flu? No.I’m taking a load of hand sanitiser and will be making sure to wash hands often.There isn’t much more that we can do- so please do try and relax and have some fun whilst you’re there!"
"I’m here right now and I only saw three Chinese with masks. Everyone is enjoying the stay! So are we. But we are having some care, like washing hands, trying not to touch a lot and always with antibac gel. Have fun! Going home tomorrow."
"I believe the US death toll from influenza this season sits at 16,000. The flu is still the bigger risk."
"Hi, i think the 1st person to respond to your question was harsh and rude, I think its a very reasonable question and was wondering the same, i am flying out from dublin on 16th march with my 10year old and nearly 2year old, i have been worried, but have no plans to cancel until there are restrictions on flying or park is closed, we will wear masks on the flight and bring lots of hand sanitizer and continue with good hand washing while we are there,Will be watching over the news over next 2weeks"
There have been cases in france but where I'm not exactly sure.

"The French Government have been giving an update on the number of cases at 19.00 each evening.As per yesterday's update, most cases where in and around the town of Creil, in the Oise region.https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"
"Hi All, Going ourselves in few weeks , perhaps this insurance guide re travel disruption will be useful for some .It only really works if there is official advise not to travel to a country or area but things might change rapidly in weeks time.blueinsurance.ie/common/1587_MultiTrip_Coron…"
"We have been considering this for a while as we have a trip booked for April. We just cancelled, after evaluating it as not worth the risk. The virus is that the stage where realistically it can no longer be contained due to its large incubation period, its now about mitigation - a pandemic is pretty much a certain now. The first school in the UK has just been closed and I expect a lot more over the next two weeks. Its a hard one as we are losing money and kids so really wanted to go, but not worth knowingly putting ourselves at risk.Edited: 9:15 am, February 29, 2020 "
Hi am worried about disneyland paris we are ment to be going 27th march not sure what to do
@40 post above is sobering but about exactly how I see it...Italy is getting hit hard right now but with world travel and borders open it is almost a certainty that other countries will be the next...my big hope is with warm weather in late spring it comes to an end. Good luck to all...so hard to know how to plan.
"Hi there, we are due to go on Monday for 5 nights. If it's still open we are definitely going. It's not even as bad as the flu, more people die from the flu every year."
Just saw news that France have banned gatherings of 5000 or more. As of last hour. So I am thinking this will impact Disneyland?
I have just called Disney about our booking. Said they are unaware of this gathering ban. They’ll try everything possible not to cancel bookings.
Rude!!!
"I guess it depends on how the ban defines a confined space, and I suppose they could limit entry numbers.Edit to say - actually sone news outlets are reporting it as indoor gatherings...Edited: 10:34 am, February 29, 2020 "
Its to allow organisers insurance policies to kick in for concerts and sporting events more than anything. Political in part.
"Kerry, I’d sit tight and see what happens. It’s too soon to call IMO. Anyway, you probably wouldn’t be covered by insurance if you choose not to travel, as opposed to being forced to cancel. Unless you can move your booking - and who knows when it would be sensible to move it to! - you may need to wait and see for a while..."
"We travel on the 18th March to Disneyland Paris with 3 kids a 3 year old a 5 year old and 7 year old. So far we are still going as we will lose thousands, we have stocked up on hand gel. And will keep an eye on the updates over the next 2 weeks. It is very worrying, it's not a silly question, we all feel the same. Hopefully it will be ok in DLP. X"
"My family and I are due to fly out tomorrow for 4 days, so as you might appreciate, we're freaking out a bit. My wife was digging around on social media for more and came across a response from today from Disneyland Paris CS on Instagram - it was in French but I've translated it.""Disneyland Paris is open and welcomes its visitors as usual. we are monitoring the situation closely and are working in close collaboration with the health authorities, whose recommendations we are following. Disneyland Paris applies exemplary sanitary procedures as well as very high standards of hygiene and cleanliness. you can find the schedules of our parks by following (link). I wish you a very nice day.""Obviously if the French authorities decide that the outbreak cannot be contained or at least reasonably slowed, they could just order the park to close, but it's worth noting that Disneyland, with its cleaning and hygiene procedures, is a far cry from, say, a concert or trade show which is what I believe the ban on gatherings of 5k or more is intended to mitigate against."
"We travel on the 18th march, it's our daughters 13th birthday, she will be gutted if we have to cancel. Starting to worry now after today's announcement about events."
Thank you that's helpful
Disney answer was after the announcement?
"Yes, I believe so!"
We are going on this date too and I’m slightly worried as travelling with two young children and my parents ( in their 60’s)
"Jake W, can you post the link of the announcement please? I can’t find it! Thanks!We will go the next weekend and we are worried too..."
"Luciana, I can't, I'm afraid. It was a screenshot posted on Insta, I just translated it. This is a bit convoluted but I've uploaded an image of the original message so you can see for yourself:https://imgur.com/a/CN55k21"
Hi well I went to Disneyland Paris 16-21st febAnd I’m ok Would still travel there tbhJust avoid high risk areas of which Paris isn’t one of them
"https:/…i believe this may be the announcement, as i mentioned in a previous post we are flying out 16th March and are still intending on going so far."
https:/…
"I think closure is imminent. French govt should close it if it is serious about containing the spread. A huge amount of children who don't exhibit symptoms and have poor hygiene control, (my youngest licks everything!) It would be reckless to keep it open. We are not taking the chance, we are booked for Easter when it will be crowded and at its busiest."
Personally I would go to Disneyland today and have zero worries. I’m just as likely to catch coronavirus at a supermarket as I am there. There is such a low probability of catching it anywhere in the world I personally think people and the media need to calm down a bit and let medical experts get on with getting a cure. Yes it could and may become more serious with time but right now I’m not worried.There are countless other viruses and diseases you are much more likely to get then coronavirus but no one seems worried about them. My point is keep calm I’m sure it’ll be fine.
"Ive just seen that France- yesterday- has put a ban on any events where more that 5,000 gather in an enclosed place. Disney are yet to make a statement but think its a case of keep checking, if they do close then hopefully we'd get a full refund or be able to go later in the year."
"Vacation38735551445, what makes you think that 'closure is imminent'? Have you seen something that suggests this? Or is it more that it is your own opinion that it should be the case?FWIW I am continuing all my holidays as planned until it becomes impossible or I deem it not sensible. Everyone needs to make a decision with which they are comfortable, based upon professional advice where appropriate.The one thing about DLP, in my own opinion, that makes it special in a way is the high number of visitors with co-morbidities - I would expect that those families may make more conservative decisions, as might I in their shoes."
Disney have already issued a statement saying there are no changes to their operations and everything is as normal. This 5000 gathering means concerts and planned enclosed events.
ThE other parks that have closed have given full refunds so would expect DLP to be the same if it comes to it
"Just want to share my opinion & experience in the hope that it might help anyone feeling anxious... My son has a severe immune defect. Not that he 'catches' more infections - it's his inability to fight them. He's also had major open heart surgery 3 times.We are not imminently due to travel, but if we were, we would definitely go. I know hands down if I contacted his immunology team, his consultant would say go - it's alway's a balancing act of enjoying a family holiday Vs risks. (He might even laugh at me & say I'm over reacting!)I am also mindful, that when my son was extremely unstable & we pushed the consultant's for holiday's abroad, travel to Spain & Italy was not allowed. The only places (I can recall) he was allowed to travel to in Europe was France, Germany & Switzerland. I alway's purchase specialist travel insurance & declare my son's complex medical history, but haven't done so for our next 2 upcoming holidays, so need to possibly sort out annual cover & one that covers 'pandemic'.Hope this does not offend - my only intention is reassure.Edited: 10:13 am, March 01, 2020 "
HiWe have been the same since we came back last week!! We have just taken it as a common virus we have picked up as we have been back to work and school . Please let me know how you get on . We are told just self isolate if you think you have been in contact!! Which we haven’t as far as we know! X
Can I just ask are you saying you have come back from Disneyland Paris and are ill? Same symptoms as the Coronavirus?
"I got to be honest, for the previous few months I was not concerned at all for our June trip. But now i am slightly worried. Nothing I can do of course. My concern isnt catching it, my concern is that our once in a life trip trip will be in tatters if everything is closed in France and Spain by June. I'm pretty sure Travel Insurance doesnt cover epidemics. Is this self centred? Probably."
"I'm 99% sure that by June nobody will even still mention the word ""Corona"". It's a virus which makes it sensitive to temperatures just like the regular flu. By the time outside temperatures start hitting 18°C you won't hear a soul about it anymore. Just be careful with your hygiëne as long as flu season lasts and by spring we'll all be fine. Every time a virus like this hits our regions the panic around it is way worse than the actual disease. More people die of a regular flu, if you have a normal immune system, are not 70+ or already in bad health, you'll be fine even if you catch it. A normal healthy person can fight it off as easily as a nasty cold.Edited: 9:25 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Common colds may be caused by corona viruses - we need to be careful, i think, to be clear that we are talking about covid-19, which as far as I am aware has not yet been demonstrated to be temperature sensitive. I haven't yet seen anything beyond a hope that this is the case. I would be interested to see a (reputable) source that has demonstrated this, if there is one?I agree with the rest of the previous post - the majority of people who catch covid-19 who are not elderly and don't have comorbidities will be fine. Not all, but the majority. With this in mind, I am not too worried about the virus. However, I wouldn't not even begin to guess how long disruption is likely to last - I am of the opinion that it could well be causing major problems into the summer. It may well be that up to now (in recent history), panic about pandemics has been worse than the actuality. However, WHO recognises that 'There is a very real threat of a rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic' - and it is therefore correct that all steps should be taken to protect people (IMO) as new viruses appear, even this isn't it."
"We are due to visit Centre Parcs in France at the end of May. Very worried about the trip but am going to monitor the situation and see what we'll do. I am sure the chlorinated water in the pool would kill any virus, but fear that the moist air and changing rooms, lockers etc could end up a breeding ground forn the virus, just unsure what to do!"

"We are also due to go mid march and I'm more worried that our holiday will be cancelled! We have a 20 month old and a 4 year old, we will follow official advice but we are not worried about catching it and certainly won't be changing our plans unless we can't physically get there."
"Hi Amy G. Same here. I don't want t our break to be cancelled either! We go on Sunday 8th. I have a very excited 4yr old. She will be devastated if it is cancelled. Fingers crossedEdited: 4:23 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Thanks for writing this as I am also going on 8th March for my birthday but I do have immune system problems but as my doctor said I could pick it up anywhere and a holiday would do me good so I’m going to continue going unless Eurostar or Disney said different if anything Disney would be first ti close as soon as they get a case so I feel it’s safer than walking around the supermarket at the moment
Hi We are booked to go in 3 weeks too.. if you have anymore updates as online it's all mixed reviews.
"We live in Rome and have been booked to go to Disneyland Paris for the past 2 months. We planned to go on the 18th - 20 of March, but now we're getting a bit nervous about going. It's not so much about getting there, it just might be a problem getting back. Paris seems ok for now, and Disney says it's ok as well, but this thing is still growing...along with the media hype. There's a bit too many unknowns up in the mix now to make a solid decision, Our 3 and 5 year old girls have been planning on this for their birthdays since we booked, but now we may have to reschedule. Anyone else here from Italy planning to go to DLP in March?"
"Si,noi dovremmo partire il 27/3 e anche noi non sappiamo cosa fare, le nostre figlie vogliono andare...ma se poi Disneyland Paris chiude?"
"I work for the NHS 111 service, I work daily regarding coronavirus cases and the dangers. this virus is currently all over the world you've got no more worry in Disney that you have in your own town. My advice would be go, take relevant precautions (anti bacterial hand wash etc.) and enjoy yourself. I'm due to fly to Paris Thursday and I will 100% be going."
We are due to hit end of May paid £2400 for Eurostar and deposit for Disney hotel and got to pay balance of £6000 in 3 weeks question is do we cut our loses and cancel losing the money paid but save the balance payment or risk it and pay it and hope for the best? Unsure how it would pan out regarding losing the money or if travel bans are suggested would we get any money back/offer to re book etc?????? We paid the cancel fee at booking but noted epidemics are not included
"Rob, not sure where anyone in this thread has recommended cancelling trip, especially taking losses like that.We are going mid June and plan to be there.If DLP close then I’m sure they will offer full refunds like they have at other parks."
We are scheduled to go to DLP March 19 with our children age 5 and 8 as well. I have den quite stressed about the Coronavirus and still not sure if we should go. Our Eurostar and Park tickets have been paid for. We are hoping for the best but also hoping DLP would close if it becomes a pandemic so that we could get some money back.
"Confusion !Everyone have the same either to proceed with the bookings or cancel the plan or reschedule.Plenty of things creating hype on social media, news etc.Few suggests to go head, few advice to re-think the plan.Even I have my booking for second week of May 20.Though this may come down / go up, we are not sure how it’s going to effect us, and how many attractions in my fifteen day trip may be effected, how many restrictions might be emerging during the travel, even after returning fifteen days quarantine is to much for my regular works if any thing goes wrong.. keeping all this I have cancelled all my bookings as I have 60 day prior cancel option with 5% deduction on my total package. If everything goes fine I can visit all the things at a later time, life is first of everything, if we are fine we do anything. After all the trip to be done with happiness but not worries..This is my personal opinion, and may not be sweet full to everyone...Take your own decision ..Wish you a happy time always!!Edited: 10:19 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"We are booked to go at the end of next week and have been debating whether to cancel or not - we will lose most of our money if we cancel. We have chopped and changed our mind several times, but we have decided just to go. You would hope Disney would close if it becomes unsafe to go there, in which case the decision would be made for us and we would at least get some money back.Its a difficult one as it is an ever changing picture from day to day.Anyone just back from there? How was it?Edited: 8:00 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Hi everyone! Here from Spain. We have to go on the 22nd of March, and I'm not going to cancel anything. If France doesn't close it it's because it's safe. The virus is just all around the world, so why not to go? The virus is very expanded but not very dangerous. I hope not be closed."
Does anyone know what happens if Disneyland closes when we’re supposed to go? Would they refund us or allow us to change the dates. We booked directly with Disney. I’m freaking out a bit as we booked a once in a lifetime trip to DLH Castle Club and worrying about the cost if we lost it.
All the other Disneyland parks that have already closed have refunded. It is on their respective websites. Hope that helps put your mind at rest
Thank you.
"We are having the same dilemma. Travelling at Easter.Our problem is that we are flying to Paris.If the park closes after we arrive there will be nothing to do while we wait for our flight home. We could be potentially sitting in our hotel room looking out at a closed park with trains etc not running for a week.So the choice is, Cancel now and lose the price of the flights but get some money back for hotel or go and risk the park closing while we are there."
Hi. We are going on Sunday on the eurostar. for 3 nights. Still planning on going.
"Daithi, i would wait a couple of weeks before you do anything. We're due to fly on 28th March and i have concerns like everyone else. I'm following all the French news and i got concerned with the jump in cases today. A lot can happen in 2 weeks and it could be possible that it can be contained or jump to stage 3. If the worst happens and a non essential travel notice is issued the airlines will change flights free of charge like they are doing at the moment for travel to Italy and if Disney has to close they will change bookings or refund. I'm not too concerned about the virus, my cornern is the same as yours traveling and then getting caught in a situation where Disney closes. I imagine Disney are watching the situation closely as the last thing they will want to do will be to close for Easter. They will give a little notice of closure. I think they gave a couple of of days when they closed Tokoyo last weekend for 2 weeks. I'm sitting tight for the moment and hopefully we will get to go."
"We’ve been keeping up to date with the situation still, and numbers seem to be rising, and the virus seems to be spreading further still. I don’t think there’s any need to avoid Disneyland Paris specifically, but it just seems too much of a risk for us to go at this moment in time. If we would have booked months ahead, we would have definitely cancelled, but fortunately we didn’t and that’s why I asked this question to get some insight and opinions from other posters. This situation could either get better or worse from this point, so we will just keep up with the news regarding covid-19 and see how the situation turns out. Won’t be booking till we know for sure, of course. Thank you everyone for all the advice and information. I’m so sorry to hear many of us have had to cancel or put a hold on our travel plans but the only thing that really matters is that we’re all healthy and still thriving. Sending positivity to all.Edited: 1:41 pm, March 05, 2020 "
Yes 58jam. Let's just hope it stays open!
"We are due to fly out on the 30th March, and I also found out that my insurance didn't cover me for pandemics / epidemics. I went on the money saving expert site as they have a page detailing the best Covid-19 policies and which companies will pay out for travel fees if your hotel / resort has closed or cancelled but there is nothing physically stopping you flying to your destination or no FCO warnings, it has a handy table on there too. I ended up buying a new policy that classes infectious disease outbreaks as a 'catastrophe' which should cover us for the flights and TGV costs."
"Stephen, I’m surprised they would cover you for a known epidemic if you only just took out the policy. Normally they will only cover if you took the policy out before it was declared an epidemic. Policies always talk about “known factors” and if there is anything you need to declare that could effect the policy..."
"Only thing is that if even one of the Disney staff tests positive any day then that's sudden and instant closure for two weeks.Then we would have to wait up to a week for our flight home.Decisions, Decisions"
I changed my insurance yesterday on the advice of my son who works in insurance and it does cover us from coronavirus. I think the thing is it is not yet declared an epidemic in France and there is no advisory not to travel there you are covered. A different thing if advice was already in place not to travel
"I can only go off what I read on the website, they have in writing as of Tuesday that they will cover anywhere not currently included in FCO warnings for coronavirus. Like others have said I don't think they've declared it an epidemic there yet and I hopefully won't have to use it"
Also our new policy is a one off trip policy. If we do not travel and manage to get a refund from Disney so make no claim we will be able to reclaim 65% of the cost of the policy back
"For the last week, Ive been trying to pay the balance on our trip to disneyland paris but the website appears to be down. Ive tried ringing on the phone number provided but no answer(I was on hold for an hour!).Also there is no e-mail address..Finally there were Iban and Bic banking numbers to lodge money into but it all seems suspicious to me that they cant even answer their phones to a paying customer!UPDATE: Ive tried ringing again and theres not even a prompt anymore..it just rings out! Ive paid over €500.00 deposit and with flights its costing me nearly €1000.00 so far. Does anyone else have this problem? How can I solve it?"
"We can't get through either. Want to change our dates as we've decided not to take our kids there during a pandemic. We are supposed to be travelling soon, and if we cannot get through, the DLP contract will mean we have to pay a fee to change or worse if we can't get through by the date we are supposed to be there we will lose everything! I understand DLP are busy dealing with many people trying to change bookings etc. If anybody has a way of getting through to them please let me know!! Feeling desperate at this stage."
I got through today and changed our booking untill october was going in two weeks x
I go in 3 weeks. Do you have to pay a fee to change booking? I booked with disneyholidays.co.uk i still want to go if its open but if its closed will i get the option of changing or full refund? Can't get through to ask.
Phoebe M...Please could you tell me how you got through? What number you used?Thanks..
"How do you contact them for changing booking?Edited: 2:33 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"So we're just back from Disneyland Paris, we were there from 1st - 5th March, staying in the Cheyenne Lodge resort hotel.There was no sign of coronavirus impacting any aspect of our trip. The hotel was busy, the parks were busy, life was going on as normal. Honestly, we didn't think about it while we were there, other than taking extra care to wash our hands etc. If you're leaving imminently, try not to worry and have a good trip. It's out of your hands and second-guessing what might happen next is only going to cause you stress."

"Magic Breaks, if that helps."
"Jake W - good reading your post, reassuring! We go next week for my son’s 16th birthday and after much debate decided not to cancel.It’s good to know that it was business as usual so it didn’t make you constantly think about the virus. I’m desperate for nothing to take the shine off the visit - so if it isn’t obvious everywhere you go then that’s good.We will just make sure to follow the standard precautions and have a great time.Thanks again - it was great to hear from someone who's just been!"
"We go in 9 days and still unsure what to do. We've not heard anything from Disney, no emails or anything confirming it is safe. We booked direct through DLP website. My parents go go Spain in 3 weeks and they have had many reassuring emails to say what safety precautions they have in place and that they remain open ect. My biggest fear is getting there and the resort gets confirmed cases and closes, we will be stranded with 3 little ones under 7"
"We are meant to fly out to Disney paris in 11 days. Really don’t know what to do as we just don’t want to get stranded or have to go into quarantine when we get home. Also my son Suffers with asthma and Coronavirus hits respiratory system. Tried ringing up Disney, it’s possible to change dates but at an extra charge. But they can’t do anything about the flights even though it was all booked through them so will be losing hundreds if we decide to do that option. This would be our first trip to Disney for our 3 children whose birthdays all fall in march. There’s just no excitement for the holiday now, only worry."
Me and my Wife want go in 2 Days we start in Austria but they cancelled our Flights to Paris maybe the Situation is not so good then they say. We cancelled everything yet and go hopefully on the 4th of May.
"We finally managed to get through to disney today, we were due to travel in 9 days, with 3 kids for 4 nights, we have re arranged for september, Disney charge no fees to re arrange, you just have to pay the difference of the different dates (March is the cheapest month, so re arranging to any other month will cost more), so we dropped a night and are going for 3 nights instead, and kept everything else on the booking exactly the same and have had to pay £167 extra, £40 of that was eurostar fees to change dates. Hope this helps others. Personally if we had no health concerns we would still have gone, but my 5 year old is in remission from kidney cancer and her immunity isn't back to 100% yet. Also we had no excitement for this trip what so ever, only worry about possible events where we will be left stranded there if the resort has to suddenly close. After paying 3k for a trip, you want to be excited for it not be dreading it, so we decided to postpone for those reasons. Those that are still going to travel in the next coming weeks... don't let it ruin your trip, if you are all fine and have no health concerns,you have nothing to worry about! and I hope you all have a great time x"
Hola!! Y es posible que para mayo la situación esté resuelta? Porque mi viaje para Disney es en mayo y ya estoy preocupada por si se podrá ir o no...
"Hello! Just to let you know, we are finishing a long weekend here and we were exactly the same about coming, but seriously, as long as you are a bit more cautious, no issues. I've still seen people walking out of the toilets here not washing their hands, but then people like us are using the clean toilet sheet things, washing hands, using handsantizer in every shop and restaurant and not touching lift buttons etc. Be cautious and you will be fine xx"
"We are going out on wednesday with our (almost) 3 & 1 year olds. Im very nervous about it all - worried about getting stuck there if the park closes and we cant get back, worried it will close before we go and I wont know what to tell my 3yr old - both of them have birthdays the following week so its a birthday trip and she is very excited but obviously wont understand if we suddenly cant go! Also wondering if we are being silly voluntarily going out travelling to another country and to such a crowded place as if we are willingly putting ourselves at more risk. Just hoping it will all be ok!"
"We are expecting to travel on 25th March. My 2 young boys are talking about it every day with excitement. Can’t make up my mind, but i am mostly cancelling if the numbers of Coronavirus cases increases. Just hopping to hear good news anytime soon and they find a vaccination. For those planning to go anyways, i hope you have great times :)"
"We shoulf Also GO next week to Disneyland - thursday, friday and saturday. A bot worried like everybody else, that The Park Will close before or during our Time there.keeping fingers crossed"
"Surely not. The virus is spreading quickly all over the world, especially in Europe and Disneyland is a place where people from all over the world goes. You may get the virus in almost every activity you do in an entertainement park. The best way of ending it all is staying home as much as possible."
"Carlo, I don’t believe that the professionals managing the worldwide situation are under any illusion that this is going to end...merely that by keeping people apart it can be delayed. By delaying it and ‘spreading out’ the cases, they can ensure health services are better able to cope. Ultimately there may (or may not) be an effective antiviral and vaccine. But there is a huge economic cost which also has the potential to adversely affect people- it’s a delicate balancing act with many, many relevant factors, and unknowns."
"We're going at the end of the March. The only thing that will stop us going will be if Disney have to close the park, Eurostar stops running or one of the family was to unwell to travel. We wouldn't not go for fear of catching the virus."
I have spoke to Disney and because they are open air this at this time isnt affecting them
"Economy is an invention of men, no real issue."
We are going on the 25 as well. With 2 small boys too. I keep checking every day to make sure it’s still open
"Myself and my daughter are due to fly out on 17th March, I'm changing out dates to November as I'm too nervous that we will get stuck there or it shuts whilst there as the cases climb higher. I'm not too nervous about thr actual virus as we are just as likely to catch here in UK.This was our second attempt at Disney as we had booked when the awful terrorist attacks happened and it had closed, my daughter is gutted but I'd rather postpone and not loose out on our flights etc if it does close."
"Pues si el virus definitivamente es estacional como la gripe, en noviembre estaremos igual que ahora. Yo creo que lo mejor es ir en verano, con el buen tiempo ya no se hablará del Coronavirus."
"En Argentina falleció ayer una persona que vino de La Vallée, París."
"En Argentina falleció ayer 07/03/20 una persona que regresó de La Vallée, París"
Vaccination?? may be in 2021!!.... may be
"I'm due to go the 25th also, and am in two minds about it all. Really dont know, if almost imagining it will be worse in two weeks and will need to cancel!"
"Hi, we are due to fly next month and I’m thinking to change the dates too. Do they let you change it?"
"We go from Romania with plane in 23.03 and I hot to no close the park and the corona reduce the confirmation.Edited: 4:18 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"We're due to go on 25th a d just taking it day by day. We've war Ed the kids that we might not go, but hoping we still can. Desperately hoping it's still open"
My sons friend is just back and I'm keeping my son out of school as per my fathers gp. My dad has COPD so we have to be super careful
We are due to travel there April 4 for kids’ birthday and have similar concerns. Has anyone tried to rebook with DLP or their air lines?
I am worry too! I am going 12 March!
"You can allways change your booking ,up to 2 days before departure"
"All,Can completely understand the concern. We went 1 week ago today and came back Wednesday just gone and was thinking exactly the same thing as you all. It was a great few days and despite what's going on, everyone continued to make the experience wonderful. Yes, we had hand sanitizer in our ruck sacks, carried tissues if required to sneeze/cough but is that really abnormal As with anything, just be vigilant and do the basics as were being advised to do. Appreciate it's not an easy decision but you should just carry on if possible. A tip - the tv in the rooms dont have many channels but do have world news! If you can, keep it off or just a minimum as it was drive you mad and you dont want it spoiling your time."
It depends on how you booked.I booked directly through Disneyland Paris and you can change your reservation. I am not sure of the fee. I don’t exactly understand the fine print in my booking policy.I don’t want to call and sit on hold for two hours having to pay several dollars per minute for the call from the United States. If you completely cancel in less than 30 days I know there’s definitely a fee.
We are due to go in April and I'm worried about them saying you need to be quarantined for 2 weeks when you get back (as that would be 3 weeks off work) or getting stuck there....If they don't close the park but advise you not to travel or be quarantined after travel then that makes it trickier.There has been a high rise in cases in France this weekend and there are talks of further measures....if it does become a full quarantine like Italy then that takes the decision out of our hands.Have to play it day by day but I'm worrying about it all
Same!! We are due to travel end of March. I'm more worried the park will close or that Eurostar will be cancelled more than I am of catching the virus. Booked this trip over a year ago. We can't all stop living & hide away.
"We were due to go to Disney in Friday this week for my son’s 16th birthday. We decided yesterday to change our plans and go later in the year. We were most worried about getting stranded over there if the hotel got quarantined or flights were restricted. We couldn’t take that risk as we have work and my son has exams soon.We called Disney (on hold for 45 mins) and changed our booking to later in the year. There was no change fee but it was more expensive later in the year so we had to pay the difference.We changed our Air France flights to later in the year, again no change fee but flights were more expensive due to time of year.We have ended up paying a few hundred pounds more but in the end it was too stressful watching and waiting and worrying about what was going to happen - it completely took the shine off our trip.Good luck everyone with whatever you decide to do."
It was announced on the late news last night that the French government have banned any gatherings of 1000 people. This surely will close Disneyland. If so we should be able to get refunds or postpone till later in the year. Think it's watching for updates today.
"Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 may increase in crowded, closed-in settings with little air circulation if there are people in the crowd who are sick."
"Yo cancele mi viaje aunque perdimos mucho dinero y pasajes. La vida de mi familia es mas importante que Disney. No vale la pena arriesgarse de mas, mucha gente enferma y muy cerca de la otra. Cuando la gente venga a reaccionar ya miles estaran enfermos."
leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne-77/coronavirus-…
I have read that Euro Disney has its 1st case of Coronavirus. However I believe it was a night maintenance engineer and no risk to public. He's been off sick for last couple of days. The Park has decided to stay open and has taken relevant precautions.
"This is worrying, I am due to go the 18th and 19th, was planning to go but unsure now. Need to decide by tomorrow to get a 80% refund on tickets, booked through attractiontix."
"Tiggerific85, my advice (FWIW!) is try not to even think about it until May! The crystal ball may well be working much better by then :) It's a fast moving situation and impossible to predict now, but may well be much clearer then."
"I have just read a post from an Australian family who has just been to DLP, she stated there was no extra hand sanitation or rides being cleaned, think of all the metal surfaces that could potenially be infected.As an individual you can be as vigilant as possible but not everybody is the same.I would NOT travel to DLP at present due to the high volume of different nationalities coming from infected areas with symptons not neccesarily showing until it's too late.My families health and well being is paramount, DLP will still be there when the virus eventually clears.I'm afraid the closeness of others for the queues, Parades & Fireworks puts me off!!It will ONLY get worse, I will not risk my families health over a theme park!!!"
"Just checking: Statistically speaking, we’re all still more likely to die on the drive to the airport / train station than from coronavirus, right?Though so. Can’t wait to visit a half empty park in July."
"There is now a reported case of a worker having the virus... this place has got to be shut....think about it ... every nationality is heading there from Europe and beyond... Disney needs to do the right thing and shut its gates... the rest of the world are banning mass gatherings..,so what is different here? They are saying this worker didn’t mix with the public but what about the co workers that they have mixed with and the surfaces they have touched? Come in Disney you’ve got millions of kids and grand parent visiting there everyday!"
I go on the 25th March as well I am taking the view unless were advised no to travel by the World Health Organisation we are going. its getting as bad in the Uk.
"Tiggerific85, while everyone hopes that the summer months will put a dampener on this virus I don't believe that anyone has yet been able to demonstrate that this virus is temperature sensitive yet. It is certainly plausible though - let's hope hubby is right :) (and if anyone has seen evidence that they have now demonstrated this, I would be keen to see it?)What is also, IMO, very relevant is the theory that: ""if you model out the epidemic, you will get 50% of all the cases over a 3-week period and 95% of the cases over a 9-week period."" (Prof Chris Whitty). So, it feels to me like once containment and delay cease to be practicable, the thing will move very fast. If the same occurs worldwide at a similar time, by the time you (and I) travel, we'll be in a new normality. My gut feeling is that we may not know by May, but we should have a much better idea how it is going to play out. The delay is really important because it helps to stop healthcare services being swamped, at least initially - the more spread out the cases, the better the healthcare available (to everyone - not just covid-19 patients)."
"Just to add my own personal opinion...I can't see any reason why we wouldn't go now if we had a booking (we've just returned from a holiday elsewhere and wouldn't have dreamed of cancelling it). Not for fear of catching the virus - although I may - and probably would - feel differently if I or my family were in a high risk group.Whether your trip - and subsequent fortnight - might be spoiled by closures, restrictions, and quarantine is a slightly different question. Each will make their own decision for their own reasons, and as far as I am concerned that's just the way it should be :)"
"disneyland maintenance worker confirmed with the virus, they are now looking into workers he has been in contact with"
After reading this DLP should shut the parks.It is unbelievable that they will put profit before people's health...How many people did he come into contact with before realising he had the virus?
I totally agree with you nannyliv the parks should be closed!!People can delay their trips......
Official Statement...disneylandparis-news.com/en/…
"We were on the fence about going at Easter. Decided now not to go. Italy had very few cases three weeks ago. Now look. It's the invisible spread that it the problem.I think the chances are very, very high now that DLP will get closed down. Along with lockdown I'm France that would not be a nice holiday.So final decision made now. Not going. Also out of respect for the effort of others not to help the spread of this virus too."
"Matt's link says:Questions about Coronavirus/COVID-19A Message about Coronavirus/COVID-19 from Dr. Cyril Warmberg and Dr. Nicolas Duport, Medical Doctors for Disneyland Paris As you may know from the news, COVID-19, commonly known as novel coronavirus 2019, has become a more widespread concern. As part of our commitment to the health and well-being of our cast, guests and the larger community, we are carefully monitoring this evolving situation and are in regular contact with health agencies for information and guidance. Disneyland Paris is welcoming guests as usual and we continue to implement preventive measures in line with the recommendations of health authorities. Disneyland Paris has high standards of cleanliness, which assists with illness prevention, and we have health and safety protocols in place, such as: Training for cast members, withongoing reinforcement on a regular basisDefined cycles for frequent cleaning and disinfection of targeted areasEasy access to handwashing facilities and hand sanitizersQuick response to spills, trash and other situationsEnd of day sanitation procedures for restroom, kitchen, and other facilitiesFrequent cleaning and “wash down” of outdoor locations, including walkways and queuesAdditionally, our onsite health teams and leaders are communicating with our cast members about illness prevention, including the health authorities’ recommendations for everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs such as: Staying home and wearing a mask when sick (upon medical prescription)Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available)Following proper respiratory cough etiquette (i.e. cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or tissue, not your hands)Avoiding close contact with people who are sickAvoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed handsRefraining from shaking hands and hugging or kissing when meeting someoneThere is more detailed information about illness prevention on these health authority websites: French Ministry of Health: https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirusWorld Health Organization: https://www.who.int/European Centre for Disease Control: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/enThank you, Dr. Cyril WarmbergMedical DoctorDisneyland Paris Dr Nicolas DuportMedical DoctorDisneyland ParisIt would be brilliant if they could keep this up to reduce the ongoing norovirus transmission in the parks!!"
We will go in two Weeks and we hope the Park is then still open ;)
"At the moment it seems to me that we are just as likely to catch this virus staying in our own country as opposed to going to disneyland. The numbers in the uk are rising rapidly every day and will soon hit the levels we are seeing in france.Unless everyone and i mean everyone is just going to take their kids out of school stop working for a few weeks, the numbers with the viruswill continue to grow."
Is anyone there today to give realistic version of events since the member of cast testing positive? We are due to arrive in DL on sunday and husband panicking.
"hollydollysparkle, what do you want to know? I guess I mean what is he panicking about? Is it about the possibility of catching covid-19, or of the park being closed, or flights/trains being cancelled, or being quarantined - there or at home afterwards, or something else?I ask because as far as I am able to tell, the realistic version is as it seems - life goes on as normal at DLP, albeit with heightened hygiene by the park and hopefully amongst the visitors (a little more hand washing never goes amiss!).But if the question is about whether the parks will still be open on Sunday, I'd say that is impossible to predict TBH. Hopefully. But I think, like everything else related to this, you can only play it by ear."
Does anyone know when this statement was issued?
"I’m getting quite nervous now - hubby not so much but im worried if the parks close while we are there with a toddler and baby, and even more so about being quarantined when we get back. Leaving weds and back sun 15th, both kids birthdays are 22nd/23rd and party on 28th! Just worried about if we make the decision to go, and then the situation changes rapidly before we get back!"
"Londongirl789, for me, while those concerns wouldn't put me off going if i had a booking, I do think they are genuine things to think about. Although, then (possibly like your hubby) I'd think, 'well, what's the worst that could happen?'"
Completely agree. It should be closed it’s too risky. Yes you can pick it up anywhere but theres a difference being home and being in another country with young children when its the second worst hit country in Europe. Best case is if Disney will just re schedule if possible or refund. I definitely don’t want to take my children on a dream holiday and be worried the whole time.
"Thanks MalDiva! I guess my main concern is ruining the kids’ (esp my 3yr old) birthday if we have to stay at home for two weeks! Not to mention the thought of not being able to leave the house for two weeks with a baby and toddler - i think we might all be wanting to pull our hair out after a couple of days! At the same time she is so excited and i dont really want to have to reschedule if it isn’t necessary. Not only will we lose money, i dont know if/when we will find another suitable time to go."
"Londongirl789, I would consider the possibility that by the end of the month, we might have guidelines questioning whether parties are a great idea anyway, depending on how things pan out...and while it seems like the end of the world, a close family party followed by a postponed 'proper' party could probably be sold to her (especially with the promise of extra pressies!) :)For the second point, we may well end up there anyway (sauvignon blanc after bedtime may be the answer!).Tough decisions for you..."
"Here now.Had a great time - would stay another week if I could.Every till, restaurant and toilet has alcohol hand sanitizer available.Hope people have a great time when they arrive, as memories with family are what we live for."
Thats true re: the party but we’d still like to be able to take them out on their actual birthdays - esp given the fact that her brother gatecrashed her celebration last year by arriving 3 weeks early! I suffer from anxiety and pre/postnatal depression to a degree so I think it would probably be more difficult for me than them to accept that a decision I’ve made might mean they miss out on a birthday celebration - or even worse will make them sick! Sigh... i need a time machine.
Thanks for posting Michael. Its great you are having a good time. Does it seem like people are being more hygenic and using the sanitizers etc? And what about in queues? Are people standing more spaced apart or are they worried others will push in so being packed in like sardines?
"Londongirl789, oh dear :(I do feel for you. people are having to make difficult decisions on the hoof and it is hard. Do you think you would feel happier f you just cancelled?"
"We are planning on going in May, so hopefully things have quiet down by then. Someone just sent me the following news article though which got me a bit worried:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-809…"
"lol, I haven't even clicked on that, working on the theory that if you don't want to read something designed to shock and cause panic, don't open links to the daily mail! :D"
"In that case, you can read it from the source if you understand French:leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne-77/coronavirus-…"
"lol, I know, I relented and opened it :)Is the worry caused by the fact that a member of staff has tested positive?"
"Personally I'm worried that an infected person has been walking around in the park, even though it was at night when the park was closed. Then it makes you wonder if he had contact with any other staff member who works during the day.Obviously a lot of all this is hysteria, but that's human nature :) I'm definitely not going to cancel our vacation just yet. Will make a decision at the end of April."
"I think you are right that the hysteria is, to an extent, human nature. I would be prepared to stick my neck out and say that, in my opinion, the situation today has absolutely no bearing on the situation on April, so personally I think you are very wise to simply wait and see."
"i do find it odd that france are not allowing events and groups over 1000 yet the crowds for the nighttime fireworks......people crammed together not being able to move im sure crowds are well above 1k for the fireworks each evening! that cannot be goodEdited: 1:07 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"@Ona V! That's very bad advice you're giving out and factually incorrect. If the virus is sensitive to warmer temperatures then why is it managing to continue to spread in places like Asia, Australia and the middle east? Also it's not just a mild virus as we don't know enough about it. As the guidelines (from the EXPERTS) state, being vigilant and having good hygiene is the best advice we can take at the moment"
"Heard of first case of corona virus diagnosed in back stage staff at the park. I have paid for first week of April trip, honestly don't know what to do ?"
"Asim S, I am afraid that no-one here can tell you the answer to that particular question, but if you read though the thread you'll find a variety of viewpoints :)"
"Nobody can answer your question for you but there are a few points to take into consideration. 1) You can catch the virus anywhere, you're just as likely to catch it in your local supermarket than in the middle on Eurodisney. 2) The most important question for yourself... in a worst case scenario, if you caught it you'd have to go into some sort of isolation. If that was in a hotel room for 2 weeks or so could you handle it?"
"En algunas Comunidades Autónomas de España se ha pasado hoy al nivel de Contención Reforzada, con cierre de todos los centros educativos y aconsejan encarecidamente no viajar si no es estrictamente necesario. Yo creo que es cuestión de poco tiempo que cierre Disney en Francia... ahí espero que reembolsen el dinero...."
"hollydollysparkleWe are here today. There has been seemingly no panic or even mention of the infected cast member other than what we’ve read on sky news, we have been told the parks will remain open unless the situation changes. Honestly at the moment things here seem to be normal other than lots of extra hand sanitizer being available everywhere and extra cleaning staff. We’ve had a fantastic day!"
"58jam, have you heard anything regarding face characters not making appearances until further notice? We are due to travel this weekend. Still planning on going for now."
Holly-We arrived on Sunday and have been at the parks both days. Absolutely no mention of coronavirus or the cast member who tested positive. In fact I just learned about it tonight as I’m reading the forum before bed. There has been absolutely no change from yesterday to today. No one wearing masks like I had seen at the airport. Lots of hand sanitizer and hand washing but that’s about it.
No haven’t heard about the characters yet. We are here until Wednesday will keep you posted about any changes.
"We are meant to be going in June, but prior to arriving in Paris we are meant to have a week in Rome, With Italy in lockdown I am quite fearful of going and if we don't go we are loosing nearly 20k AUD on this European trip."
"Hi, we are at Disneyland Paris just now. I will admit I was very apprehensive about coming, but the flight, the airport and the park all seem just like normal. The only difference is hand gel is available everywhere. I have only seen two people in the parks wearing masks. The place is just as busy and happy as normal. So glad we came."
"Hi all,Just arrived back from the parks via Eurostar last night.I’ve been there since 4th March, and it’s very much business as usual.As a matter of fact, if I hadn’t been looking at this forum I’d have been totally unaware of the panic that is setting in.In the parks everyone was having a great time, with the only reminders being hand sanitizers in shops and all toilets, and the odd Chinese person wearing a face mask... but this was very rare.In the Gents I can say that i did not witness one person not washing their hands, and that the Hand sanitizer was also being used often by the public in toilets and at tills.I would have honestly stayed with no worries for a couple more nights, the parks are clean.If I were on the verge of leaving now like many of you are, the biggest issue in my own mind would be whether the parks were forced to shut by the French Government, which under this scenario your travel insurance should cover you.I wouldn’t cancel my holiday under any other circumstance.But everyone has different levels of worry, and if you are going to Disney and will be worrying every single day then perhaps it’s better for you to try and reschedule...Whatever you choose I hope you have a good time when you get there."
"Well, against my will:)) I canceled my trip for tomorrow. We were due to be there until Monday, with 2-3 days în Disneyland. If it would have been my decision, I would have kept going. But let's say everybody îs a bit paranoid around me:)) NOT sure if there is an option to get back the money for the entrance ticket, but thats it:)Edited: 3:37 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I think someone asked about ‘face characters’ earlier...announced this morning, princess pavilion closed and no princesses at ADC (guests informed prior to entry).Edited: 4:20 am, March 10, 2020 "
"According to DLP report Mickey, Minnie, Perla and Suzie were at ADC breakfast this morning. There are plans for a Princess Walk and a surprise show on the castle stage according to ED92.Edited: 4:29 am, March 10, 2020 "
I'm pretty shocked that they didn't close the park for even half a day to do a deep deep clean after the worker was confirmed infected.A maintenance man must have been doing maintenance & since no one knows (keeps changing) how long it can live on surfaces this is especially worrying.You would think at the very least they would do that.Others here have also mentioned about crowds at fireworks and when everyone keeps saying its outside but some of the rides are inside & you sit very close together.Must admit I'm getting myself in a bit of a state about it all ...as I don't understand why Disney is exempt from the rules & I'm concerned they are valuing money over safety esp following their staff member being sick.Ultimately I'm going with a large group so its not my decision whether to move the dates ...if I drop out I could lose alot of money & i saved for a long time to go & have been waiting to go for 20 years!I'm just really shocked that Disney aren't being more open & aren't more concerned...
"Alwayspoppy - with regards to your point about the rides, I would say that it's a similar situation to most public transport - planes/buses/trains.... and as far as I know they are also still running in France. The risk at DLP is a similar risk to a busy town/city."
"Just to add from my previous message, this morning the single queue lanes have all been closed. They were open first thing, but are now shut. Apparently some people raised issues about strangers sitting next to them. This has led to much longer queue times for rides. Parks still very busy and business as usual:-)"
"What hysteria on here. You are just as likely to pick this up as you are any flu based virus in the parks or your local supermarket. Even if you do pick it up as the deputy health secretary to the UK stated today 'most will contract it, however its harmless to the vast majority.' If you have underlying health conditions (your unlikely to be queuing for rides) then its another story but for most people its no worse then a usual flu. Demanding a business should shut its them being greedy its you being paranoid and wanting someone else to pay out for your own decision which is against the guidance of the UK government experts who are currently stating safe to travel."
"We are having almost a pandemic situation world wide. Many countries closed the schools, recommended work from home, asked to avoid large group of peoples, etc... even France restricted to have events with more than 1000 people and what Disney do??? They are not answering over the phone, they do not offer us the chance for changing the dates and the most important they do not respect France authorities decision and they put our lives in danger. So let's suppose that someone is sick but without symptoms, and he will stay in the same train/montaigner, etc... with a healthy person. Does this seems good, do you all seems that we will be protected, are you confident to go there with your children or elders or with a diabetic person...? Shame on you Disney, a bitter taste for me.....Edited: 6:18 am, March 10, 2020 "
We were due to go tomorrow and we were really excited even with the Coronavirus shadow hanging over us as we feel we could pick it up in the UK just as easily. However on calling Disney to see if there were any reservations in the princess restaurant I was told they are not going to make appearances in there. We were offered a table but it would be Micky and friends. I understand any people characters have to now wear masks ? And the princess pavilion is closed. My youngest daughter is so excited about photos with the princesses that I thought what is the point of spending all that money and for her not to be able to meet them. So I have now rebooked for December. We were lucky as had booked the Eurostar separately and not bought the park tickets yet. We have still lost a lot of money to change the train but I think it was the sensible option. Hope everyone is having a fantastic time there and I’m not looking forward to telling my two young daughters later !
"Hi can i ask were you charged by Disney to change the date of your holiday?Edited: 7:27 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I didn’t book direct with Disney so all I had to do was pay to change my train tickets and cancel the hotel we were staying in outside the park , I’m not sure what the case is for people who ha e booked Disney packages"
Face to face character meetings at Auberge and the pavilion now cancelled until further notice
"I totally agree with you!!Disney are placing profit before individuals health.The Park should close, Princesses meet & greet is now cancelled & at The Pavillion but Disney still continue to take our money, shame on you!!!"
Likewise 22 March we are just going to go for it the only thing to stop us is if we are stopped by government in which case you get your money back
Anyone having trouble getting through to Disney holidays? Woman answered and made out she couldn't hear me and hung up! Rang friend after and she could hear me. Think they doing this because they keep getting calls
there is someone at Disney with the virus but they refuse to close
What did you decide to do..my daughter should be going next week with 3.5 years and one year old.I'm concerned
"Catherine... your post makes it sound like there is a crazed loon with coronavirus running around sneezing on people. The facts of the matter are that in the most popular tourist attraction in Paris, ONE person, who works night shifts doing maintenance work and came into contact with zero guests and a very small number of other night workers, has the virus/is displaying symptoms. Please be a bit more responsible when posting. The fact that ONE person out of their 15,000 strong workforce has the virus is common knowledge now, we don’t need people panicking and posting it every few hours- it creates the illusion that many workers have it, which isn’t true."
"Not trying to diminish the seriousness of the threat, and certainly it's an evolving situation, but a brief google search shows there are 1,412 confirmed coronavirus cases in France. With a population of 66,524,000 that means .0000212% of the population have the virus.Yes, that number may increase but based on current statistics then at present you should be more worried about getting into a car accident driving to the grocery store."
"Dear all,I see you very relaxed. Like this has been Chinese and Italian. Look at them now. There is no hysteria, it is only common sense. It is a pandemic situation with a virus without a cure for the moment. Death percent is around 4% so if you choose to be relaxed go one but don't judge responsible people. Disney should close their gates....."
"At present there are 116,345 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide with 4,091 deaths (so .035% of the people who caught the virus have died thus far). YES, IT'S SERIOUS. But panicking and worrying and relying on info ""you heard from a friend of a friend"" and not studying statistics and science is not the right way to approach confronting the actual threat it poses to you (at present). This is not a pandemic (see WHO definitions of pandemic and other info). Taking smart precautions (hygiene and common sense) is the the right way to approach this at present. Check for daily updates and monitor the situation. But being ""chicken little"" and worrying about ""the sky falling"" is an irrational response to a situation that based on current statistics is most likely not going to affect you.Edited: 10:09 am, March 10, 2020 "

"In my part of the world 4% percent is serious. But I see that in your part of the world, the situation from Italy,for example, it is not big deal. Italian people are crazy probably, in your opinion, because they closed the borders and had a lot of restrictions. Let's conclude this, no one is exaggerating, it is only common sense to avoid crowds and busy places, it is just common sense and Disney does not show common sense. Do we know with how many workers came in contact the worker with Coronavirus? No we don't know but there is no reason to panic in your opinion. In my opinion this is somehow strange. I cherish my and my family life. So if the cost, even for a small percentage, is to be ""Chicken little"" let me be please..."
"You obviously cherry picked through what I said and picked out the points that suited your desire. I SAID IT'S SERIOUS. Serious precautions are being taken (lockdown in Italy, for example) to prevent the spread of the disease. That's common sense. If you don't want to rely on science and statistics (I provided statistics and sources, read them) that's your prerogative and you can be chicken little. The biggest concern most folks should have is how this may affect their travel plans if the government in France takes serious restrictive measures. That may in fact happen if the number of confirmed cases dramatically increases but no one can predict that so it's a wait and see situation.Edited: 3:14 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"In France not much measures 1500 sick people ( not yet reported today) from 66 millions people. In Romania 17 cases out of 22 millions ( schools closed, work from home, theater closed, crowds with more than 200 people are not allowed, concerts cancelled, etc..) Probably it is about culture. What I want to say is that we don't need to judge, it is a delicate situation we are for the first time here and we need take care. Now if you think that Disney is safe and if you trust French authorities it is ok, but in the same time we or I can have my concerns. So soemone is doing a big mistake, I hope from all my heart that I am the one who exaggerates. Cheers!"
Hi adrian. Can u provide the source of your information regarding the 4 percent mortality rate. I have not seen a rate mentioned as high as this before and i wouldnt mind seeing this.
"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/116,359 sick people in total4091 - deaths A little bit under 4%. Regarding statistics, last year in US, Flu A: ( i have read an article, don't remember where)13 millions people6000 deathAround 0,5%So we can say, statistically, that we really don't want to have coronavirus spread like Flu."
"And one last point, the majority of deaths have been among elderly people, people with respiratory issues and/or chronic diseases (severe diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, cancer etc.). For most healthy people who fall outside these categories it has the effect more or less of a cold or flu. And some people can have the virus and display no symptoms. The real risk is that those who may have the virus and display no symptoms can spread the disease to those in the high risk categories I mentioned. Here are the latest statistics for mortality rates among those who have caught the virus:Under 40 years old - .2%People in their 40's - .4%People in their 50's - 1.3%People in their 60's - 3.6%People in their 70's - 8%People in their 80's - 15% (because the older you get the more likely you are to have a chronic disease)In older healthy people you are unlikely to develop serious symptoms and die. Children generally don't catch the disease or are asymptomatic. The moral of the story - STOP PANICKING AND LOOK AT THE FACTS, THE STATISTICS, THE SCIENCE, AND THE ACCREDITED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE EASILY FOUND IN BASIC GOOGLE SEARCHES WHERE YOU CAN GET REAL TIME INFORMATION AND ADVICE."
"The real problem is that people only hear ""unknown virus"" and behave as if it were the black death and start to panick.The chance of infection - while existent - is so so small.I've never seen people worry as much about the common flu, which has so many fatalities every year!So while I totally understand people worrying about catching a virus: if you’ve never before worried about going to Disney and catching the common flu: stop panicking now. Seriously!"
"From someone who is currently at Disneyland Paris, from our view they have put discreet, subtle changes in which make all the difference. Hand sanitizer is available at every till or reception desk, CMs are wearing gloves if they have to touch rides etc. The parks are still busy, odd few people wearing masks but nothing that shouts something is wrong or to put you off. We're just using antibact more frequently. It's really not spoiling our fun."
"OK. I meant to say 3.5% as an average (I forgot to move the decimal point after dividing on my calculator). But that still does nothing to validate the level of panic I'm seeing on so many of these coronavirus threads and that figure is just an average without taking into consideration who is most at risk. Nonetheless, the statistics, science and facts cited above speak for themselves. I will reiterate, you should be more concerned about any potential measures the French government may take if the threat increases and how that may affect your travel plans."
What does CM mean?
Thanks for your Information! We will be there in two Weeks.
Cast Members - it's what Disney call the people who work there
"French_Mystique . Don't take this the wrong way but maths isn't your strong point it it :-)Decimal points make a huge difference you know. Very importantEdited: 11:33 am, March 10, 2020 "
"One question, do you keep up with the normal rhythm in the park or have you canceled a show or decreased the number of characters? Can you continue living the magic of Disney ?. We are not afraid of the coronavirus, but the measures taken for it, park closure, border closure ... does anyone know anything else?Edited: 11:45 am, March 10, 2020 "
We will go to Disney on March 18
I'm currently waiting in airport in for our flight to Paris. Going Disneyland until Saturday. Pretty apprehensive as im going with a 3 year old and my partner. Hopefully don't get stuck on the way back or the park gets shuts down while we're here.Will update on the trip.
"French mystique....they keep saying underlying health problems but what does that mean...high blood pressure, diabetes...? Neither of those are imminently life ending conditions whilst controlled & most of us know alot of people with them...I wouldn't expect anyone to die with those when catching flu.Over 60 also isn't elderly ....since the government states you can work much much older than that...it hasn't been elderly for some time yet during this crisis it keeps being stated as elderly...It's all very strange..like oh well they have underlying health conditions & are elderly (neither being really true) so it's not a huge deal (not saying you said that but the media certainly is!).The survivors accounts also seem to show it's much more serious than flu.The governments also won't ban travel to anywhere not even Italy when they are in full lockdown because if they did then refunds and insurance have to happen. By saying basically not suggested but its your choice the individuals lose the money....which is also wrong.Its Disney that have to make the decision on how serious this is and whether their guests should be protected & atm they seem the one place that doesn't care.The figures are jumping so drastically & theres so much unknown...I certainly think they should be doing more than they are to reassure everyone...I understand some people aren't concerned at all which is great....I'm all for that as long as you are being hygienic and are happy to carry on as normal that's fab...I commend that but the other end of the spectrum is also understandable when dealing with a new worldwide pandemic..."
"Daithi - Yes. I'm embarrassed by my stupidity in forgetting to move the decimal point two places. Please forgive me. True, math is definitely not my strong point but I hope you'll overlook that technical error now that I've admitted my fault and look more closely at the over all current of what I'm trying to convey. I would also like to mention that those mortality rates that I cited pertain to China (they are not worldwide stats) and they date to February 11th. I've just started a thread on this topic and posted in both the Paris and France forum so if you want to keep current with those threads then here are the links:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18707… Alwayspoppy - I hope you'll look at the links I've provided and the sources cited in those links. This is NOT a pandemic (as I've already mentioned and you can check the WHO website for more info about that). I'm not going to respond to all your points because if you look at the links I've provided I think you'll find your concerns have been addressed and that I've covered the major areas of concern (though I am not pretending to be an expert nor pretend that I have all the answers)."
Thanks. Yes of course. I've done alot of research including on CDC and WHO and spoken to doctors and scientists and a majority are concerned....my concern hasn't come just from listening to propaganda media hype.I admit I was wrong calling it a pandemic and I apologise about using the wrong word.I hope that you dont think I was being rude to you...I wasn't at all. My post came across in a much harsher tone than I meant.Overall I'm just disappointed and concerned how Disney are dealing with this and I've lost alot of respect for them and I'm sad and worried about it.
I read on Reddit that the Princess character dining and meet and greats have been cancelled and it is Minnie & Mickey at the dining? Apparently there is a new float substituting the interactions? Has anyone heard anything about this or seen it in the past few days?
"klattsy, yes that is right. It was confirmed this morning."

"Just in response to post 249, paragraph 1...this isn't my experience at all so clearly there are differing views in all walks of (professional) life as well as there are across all social media on this subject!"
Oh yes definitely and thats always good news if people aren't concerned :)
Alwayspoppy - I don't think you have anything to apologize for but since you willingly apologized anyway (without reason or necessity) then I must say that a public apology is the most sincere form of apology and is definitely a measure of your worth as a human being.I didn't think you were being rude to me at all and I hope you take that likewise. I still disagree with your opinion as to how Disney is handling the situation but I don't expect that everyone on the planet will agree on all issues at all times. As long as we can agree to disagree with respect (and we can still continue debating respectfully while disagreeing) then that is the most important thing because our respectful public disagreement will appeal to a much wider audience of diverse opinions.
"Can someone currently there update on whether the shows (Frozen 2, etc) are still taking place as scheduled?"
"Leads1, good to hear. I've said it already, but I am boring like that so I'll say it again - I hope they keep up this level of cleanliness because the way norovirus (and/or other other V&D) goes through DLP is pretty horrific."
"Emily P, I am sure Leads1 will update, but I have seen on other social media that shows and parades are as normal, although indoor shows are limiting numbers to comply with the governmental restrictions (to 900 I believe), plus the extra princess parade.Edited: 5:12 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"It seems that Disneyland may be placing its business interests above the health of the community: other institutions that have staff who have Coronavirus have closed down for a deep clean. It is concerning that a staff member who works cleaning is involved - presumably, whatever they touched in the course of working there would need to be fully sanitized. Such deep cleaning usually is undertaken as a precautionary measure to eliminate all risk of transmission."
Hi Leads1!Sounds like you're having a fabulous time!Fill us in when you've time please<3
"What are the chances of Disneyland actually closing ?, i am due travel the 21st but don't really what to the risk of getting stranded in France"
"Culbert, no one can predict that with any amount of certainty.I believe it's a question of ""when"", not ""if"" it will be closed."
"We are due to travel to Brittany in July for our annual 3 week holiday, really hoping that the virus is somewhat gone by then and things are back to normal, but it is what it is i suppose."
Meanwhile there are 3 official covid 19 confirmed cases between disneyland paris castmembers. It's so egoistic to think about your plans without caring of all the deaths all over the world. Young people are dying too.
I dont think anyone is ignoring the seriousness of the issues and no one wants to see death involved. But some of us have been saving for a once in a lifetime trip and are obviously concerned with meeting the dreams of our family.
"In Romania, the north part of the France has been included on the Red list. This means that all the people coming from France should go 14 days in quarantine . It is a matter of time until all the France will be included so it will be quite impossible for us to go to Disney. Who will choose Disney and after that 14 days of Institutionalized Quarantine. Disney should show some respect for theircustomers and close the park...."
Carlo M - where did you get the info for the 3 confirmed cases between cast members?
"Whilst I think there is a strong likelihood that it will have to close eventually if the French authorities tell them to, I think people who are calling for it to close now and berating them for not doing so are being unfair. Of course there is a financial element. They are a business trying to stay afloat at the same time as keeping its guests as safe as possible. A proportionate approach in my eyes. I live in oxford. Two students have tested positive so far but the University is still open and nobody is calling for them to close. I for one would hate to see the DLP that I have loved for over 20 years become a victim of this virus."
Kay88- hope the link workshttps:/…
"It does, thank you"
"Hello, Is anyone else due to go really soon (as in next few days) and is mostly unsure of going due to not wanting to be stuck there for 2 weeks? Does anyone know what would happen if that was the case?"
#255 french_mystique thank you! I definitely respect your opinon and have been thinking about what you have said. I am so worried about it that it is easy to lose perspective and therefore its helpful to get other opinions. I appreciate your response & kind words & very much respect your opinon whether we agree or not :)
"I totally agree with you.3 more cast members have tested positive, now closures & no meet & greet with the Princesses.I for one will definately be cancelling, the Magical Experience has been compromised now!!Edited: 11:08 am, March 11, 2020 "
"I was going to be in DLP this saturday and sunday, but had to cancel. In my country (netherlands) and especially my province, the situation is getting worse. The government has advised people living in my province to minimalise social contact as much as possible. For this reason I decided to cancel. I Dont want to be stuck in a hotel or not be able to go back. Me and my friend are both students, finishing our degree this June. Hence, we cant afford getting sick or stuck somewhere. It really sucks but we both think this is for the best."
"Yesterday i have stated that we have a pandemic situation worldwide. Someone told me that this is not true. Few moments ago Health Organization declared Pandemia https:/…coronavirus-news.amp.html So... what would you do Disney, still business as usual...?"
Are you still going? Do you know what are the things going in Paris at other atracction points? We are going on 21 March...
"You are very wise....keep doing the right choises.Edited: 12:49 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"The fact that this has now been classed as a pandemic may help some people, as I know that a lot of insurance policies will cover for a pandemic situation."
still going?
I planned for 20th march and bought tickets and everything but now my wife is scared and here in Denmark the cases are increasing day by day. Does anyone know if Disney refund the ticket price or can the same ticket be used for later date? I hope they do let us use it in May or June
Please be aware that this story has been posted by ONE newspaper in the UK. Namely The Sun newspaper which regularly publish false stories. I cannot see any of this corroborated in any other news channel or newspaper. I would therefore seriously question the legitimacy of the story.
"Just seen this:""Seasons of the Force and Illuminations are cancelled until further notice. I dare say more to do with a mass gathering of people in a small place.Fridays AP night is also cancelled."""
"i am heading disneyland paris 23rd march.. hope to see illumination and show etc,,anyone who there now ( disneyland) can reply to this message? is it really canceled? illumination..fireworks ...thanks"
"Presently Disney are not offering cancellations or refunds or allowing dated tickets for use on alternative dates. The park is still open, o ly 1 ride is attraction is closed. Its unfortunate the soiree is cancelled and the seasons curtailed but it makes good sense"
"We are due to go August but have to pay by May too, and it is worrying. I really hope it's contained by then x"
"We also want to be a family from April 8th. drive to Disneyland Paris for 4 days. We also check the situation in the park every day. The list of countries into which Germans are no longer allowed to enter is getting longer every day, whether that will soon also apply within Europe ... The question is, of course, whether it is even responsible. Money or not. So far we have been rather cautious about Corona and behave in the same way as for the flu wave. If it gets worse though ... We don't feel like quarantine / isolation in France or afterwards at home."
Three Disneyland Paris workers test positive for coronavirus and are placed in quarantine as the park closes two attractions.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8100517/Three-Disneyland-Paris-workers-test-positive-coronavirus-placed-quarantine.html
I wonder why people are so stupid to expose their children and others to the risk of getting infected! In the current situation you should stay at home. you don't necessarily have to go anywhere at any price. it is precisely because of such idiots that the disease spreads so quickly!
"I will leave here a post from a person from Italy - founded on FB - no connection with this person, This is specially for the people who thinks that Coronavirus is just a flu and for the Disney careless Executives who place money before health:""I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality. The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today.If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse.Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left?On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse.There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.You have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time.And for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a week ago.Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now.Please share.""So if you think Disney is a safe place, if you think that France is not doing the same mistake as Italy... feel free to go on your own risk. I have my tickets on 21st of March and I will definitely not going, I will not expose my family or myself to any imminent danger. My biggest issue is that Disney is not answering to any phone, e-mail or FB message in order to allow me to cancel my trip ( as per contract). So allow me to say that Disney is beyond any imagination and they place financial interest above people health. Shame on you Disney..."
"Some people can’t afford to simply throw away thousands of pounds, if that makes me stupid then so be it, i’m not happy that i may have to go in just over a week and i don't really want to, im not willing to pay the extortionate fee to change my travel date either, but also I'm not prepared to lose our hard earned money"
I can not understand how the French government have allowed Disney to stay open. They put restrictions on 1000 people yet there are more than 1000 staying in the Disney hotels and in the 2 parks. This is even more puzzling that there has been 3 confirmed cases there now. I feel it's a case of putting profit before life. Think it must be closed soon. Hopefully then we can get a full refund.
"So I just went through all the T&Cs of my DLP direct booking. On the last page the last section is Information Notice Relating To Packages...it mentions specifically:“Travellers may terminate the contract without paying...and get a full refund...if any of the essential elements of the package...are changed significantly”Further“Travellers may terminate...in the even of exceptional circumstances, for instance, if there are serious security problems at the destination...”Now I’m not sure if “packages” relate to transport + park or also relate to board + park...in other areas of the T&Cs it mentions packages and packages + transport so maybe?It also references Directive EU 2015/2302. No idea what is.Maybe someone who is planing to cancel wants to reference this section of the T&Cs to see if it assists.Edited: 4:17 am, March 12, 2020 "
"I totally agree with you, reading the latest update from Disney it states:New measure are in place until the 15th April:All indoor spaces will have limited capacity with entry & exit regulations.Animagique Theatre, Moteurs Action Stunt Show, Studio Theatre & Buffalo Bills Wild West Show.Certain Restaurants & The World of Disney Store & Studio 1.Single Rider lines are temporarily removed.Queue capacities are limited.Air conditioning will no longer recycle air.

"Totally agree with you,Disney should be ashamed of themselves this is peoples lives they are playing russian roulette with.With all the changes they have implemented the 'Magical' experience is gone, Disney is not a cheap holiday!! I for one have just cancelled I fear we will be in the situation that Italy is in now, it will only escalate.I wish you all well and stay positive!!"
"Hi Lorna , Can you tell me where you found the info about what is closed at the park.I can’t seem to find any offfical statement anywhere .I’m due to go on 18th , pretty much for the Frozen stuff , and if the parades and outside shows are cancelled then there seems little point !"
"We aere planning Paris + Disneyland trip for 3 months. With 1 week stay at Paris Grand Opera Hilton. Fantastic trip. With everything included. But now , even she was upset, and crying, even my 8 year old daugher understood that it is crazy to travel . And we cancelled last night. And we dont get any refundd. But stil - I think its right decision. And its stupid decision not to close park"
"So after reading the DLP T&C's I thought i'd check my 1Cover travel insurance policy. Once it was declared a pandemic, or if there is a travel ban in place, we are no longer covered. So gutted. This gets worse and worse for us. So the only way we can get a refund on our $7k trip is if DLP close. To top it off, we had to put our darling cocker spaniel down on the weekend as well so this has not been a good week."
"Today we were supposed to be in Disneyland. Yesterdays aftew hours waiting on the phone we manage to rebook our tickets from the 2nd to 4th of November. They told us that they will sent us a confirmation e mail within 24 hours with our new booking days. they havent done this yet and I have worries because they sent me a WELCOMING to disneyland e mail for today. obviously I am not there. Terrible call center, such a disgrace the fact that they dont close the park. disneyland Japan did it with 200 cases of corovovirus and disneyland paris stays open with 2200 cases in France. i know its a lot of money but we must stay HEALTHY"

"I am due to arrive sunday, and have decided to not go. Disney put me 2 hours on hold and then cancelled my call. My emails are not being delivered. I will loose my money, but would like to move our dates.... however it is impossible to reach them, they cancelled all show etc etc. Please close the parc give people a refund, this is just so crazy."

Anyone in same situation as us in that we have just arrived yesterday and havent been able to see the parades/shows but im guessing obviously we can’t “cancel” fee-free as we are already here. Yet had this all been announced the day before we came we would have taken the cancel option. Do we just have to suck it up?
"Hmmm, Londongirl, if I were actually there as you are, I would pop along to City Hall and see if some kind of goodwill gesture could be negotiated. I wouldn't hold my breath but have actually always found DLP very accommodating when faced with a polite yet convincing argument for something."
The problem now is actually being able to speak to someone on the phone to be able to make an amendment /cancellation ! Just hoping I can get through before I’m due to go away on Wednesday !
We are back since tuesday and we had a lovely time there! Desinfection gels everywhere in the park and the hotels.
Did you went? I m going tomorrow but i saw that many shows are cancelling
When we were there until the 10 of march there were no cancellations so far.
Can I ask....did you have to pay more to move the date to September? Because when I search the prices for September are much more than I paid. Or did they honour the price you originally paid? Many thanks
"An update , just got a full refund - including flights - from Disney holidays . They suggested changing dates or cancelling free of charge . Really well informed member of staff who was really apologetic and helpful.But be warned I was on hold for 3 hours and 35 minutes before I got through !"
Hi can I ask did you both have holidays booked direct with Disney.
Anybody know the refund/reschedule rules around tickets only (daily ones - purchased on the Disney site)Thanks
Just seen that Disneyland California is closing
"Hi, has anyone booked with Magic Breaks and cancelled or amended their holiday? If so, what we're the charges? We're due to go 15th April via Eurostar and are considering changing the date of our hol in a week or 2 if things don't improve. At present, Magic Breaks have said we can't change our eurostar and will have to lose the money and pay for new train fare and we'll have to pay £25 to change booking. Thought heard from others on here that they'd changed their eurostar for free and others for £40.Any help and info would be greatly appreciated"
"Hi KerriD, yes i booked directly through Disney. Got through on 0800 169 0737. If on hold just stick with it you will get through eventually just double check opening hours. So worth it to get it sorted!"
"I have booked with Magic Breaks due to go 21/3/20 and they are refusing to let me cancel. We are going for the Frozen spectacular which is more or less cancelled, as is our Princess breakfast. I am going to seek legal advice as Disney are not giving us the holiday we paid for."
Due to go this Sunday but not sure I want to end up getting stuck in France if they do an Italy style shut down. See some people got a refund ringing Disney customer services.....going by the time on hold around 4 hours I cost the call at around £40. Just wondering if getting a refund is guaranteed and worth the time and phone bill outlay ?
"Dawn D Please can you let us know how you get on and what advice your given as we are also booked with them and looking at cancelling or amending our booking for later on in the year. Disney on their website have stated that they will let you cancel or amend booking if due to arrive before 1st June for free but Magic breaks seem very stubborn in not allowing anything without paying or losing quite a bit of moneyEdited: 6:21 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I booked through magic breaks and spoke to them on Mon. I was told that I could change the Disney accommodation up to 3 times free of charge but would lose the cost of the Eurostar. I'm hoping that they close Disneyland Paris and we should get a refund. Just seen that California is closing on Monday and there's no recorded coronavirus cases there.
"ChristAt least the Americans are showing some empathy, they are closing Disneyland Resort from the 14th March in California with NO reported cases BUT Disneyland Paris remain open with people coming home feeling ill & 3 reported cases that they know of.Shame on you!!!!!!"
"AFH - We didn’t end up moving it as yet because they told us it would be another £700 for new train tickets, however I can confirm that they did NOT honour the price, we would have had to pay the extra to move it to September.I am baffled at how the other Disney sites are shutting and some have no cases on the virus, yet Paris is staying open with three confirmed cases, and probably more that we don’t know about!!Fingers crossed that we all get refunds. If we do get a refund I will definitely consider booking the Eurostar separately myself because if we had of done that we would have been able to simply go online and move the dates for the journeys no problem at all. Not be told we need to pay for the tickets again for another £700!"
"Tania SI looked online for dates in October and they're cheaper through eurostar than they are with disney by £75 (2adults,2 year old and 7 year old) I won't be booking a transport package with Magic Breaks etc again"
Not sure if this is true about global disney park closures until end of Marchhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.co…
It’s on the official Disney Parks Twitter. https:/…1
Wonder what that's means for those of us going in Easter hols with regards to refunds/ cancellation of eurostar disney packages
Hi we are here now arrived yesterday and tbh wish they would of closed the parks now and we would of gone another time. It's not as magical.there is no illuminations no parades it's literally just the rides I understand heath is more important they should of just shut the parks for a while as there is no magic in there like there usually is. I've just read they are closing the parks from monday and I think that's for the best as at least people will then be refunded.

Just seen the post on Facebook from Disneyland Paris tips which says closed from 16 March until end of March but hotels open? So question is I’m going 22-26 do I get refund now or not?
“ I’m going 22-26 do I get refund now or not?”All the details are on the websitehttps:/…
"Hi KerriD Yes I booked direct with Disney holidays .The number is 08001690737 , It was a long long wait on hold , but worth it ! X"
"Im flying with jet2 on the 22nd and i bet they dont offer refund or wave the fee to change dates as they’ll say flights are still going ahead, absolute joke if this happens, are they expecting people to still go and just sit about in the hotel because i for one have no interest in sightseeing around paris."
"All Disney parks now to close on sunday until the end of the month.[EDIT] Apologies - just saw that this new has already been posted. For us going at the end of May this is probably better news, but I feel for anyone there now or due to go soon.Edited: 3:31 am, March 13, 2020 "
"here's some wording:Breaking: Disneyland Paris is closing from Monday March 16, 2020 until the end of March as a safety precaution for Guests and Cast during the current outbreak. Disneyland Pars' hotels and Disney Village will remain open for nowSource The Walt Disney Company: https://twitter.com/DisneyParksNewsAlso included was that staff will be paid as normal."
This News/update still isn’t showing on the Official website? Is it definitely official news? Thanks.
And I had to deal with Flybe issues last week guess this holiday not meant to be..
"AFH, I thought the same. The website still says open as normal! However, if this is fake news it has been picked up by many major news outlets so they've done a good job! Fr this reason, I think, on balance, that it is probably correct. I'd stake money on it but not my life!"
"My niece and friends are due to fly out from UK tomorrow for her hen do early tomorrow. They already have daily Disney tickets for Sunday 15th and Monday 16th March but of course, the 16th tickets are Mini so are not valid on Saturday. Anybody know if the Mini tickets can be upgraded to Magic on the day (so they can go on Saturday instead of Monday)Will try to get through to Disney them selves, but guessing they will be totally swamped now. Got some very upset ladies here!"
"this notice if from magicbreaks :13th March 2020 We have received this morning the following update from Disney.

We will continue to stay in close contact with appropriate officials and health experts.Once we have a further update we will advise.Edited: 4:50 am, March 13, 2020 "
Gollom... I know it's a difficult decision but I would honestly say if they are going just for this weekend then not to bother... re-arrange. Obviously this is hard being a hen do but I doubt the park will be a great place to be this weekend with all the staff knowing they are closing etc!
"Gollom, all personal opinions, but in their shoes I’d go and argue the toss in person. I’d be optimistic that under the circumstances they’d say yes, whatever you like!"
"I’d anticipate the staff all being super jolly, making the last couple of days (for a while) as amazing as possible...but who knows!"
"Good luck trying to get through to rearrange - I’m on attempt no. 69 and they let it ring, pick up and put the phone down straight away. I do understand how busy they must be but I’d rather be held in a queue than this."

The WDTC website still says nothing and even lets you try and book for March....
"Marc, I follow a group on fb and another site and both report that although the WDTC site has nothing they are in the process of offering the policy changes as stated on DLP site regarding swap of dates etc."
Anuual Pass holdersMy friend just got through after many attempts and got his answer so i'll post it here. Its regarding annual passes.He had annual passes for the whole family that they only used for easter and during the summer months as they live in a different country so they are wasted now for this year.Disney will honor annual passes for the same periods next year for the dates they are closed this year.eg annual passes valid over easter this year will be valid over easter next year if the park is closed. They will honour this even thought the dates are different for the period.Any new annual passes bought will have credit added on for the days you missed out of your current pass.
Tiggerific85 - Thanks for the update. We currently plan to wait until April at least to see what's happening but good to know they are offering the same terms.
Anyone know if they will process a refund automatically or surely you do not have to spend a fortune trying to speak with someone to say want a refund when they are closing the park ?
Marc we’ve decided the same because we go in July and our balance due in May; we can’t apply for the change yet.
"Hi, we are booked with Magic Breaks to go next Sunday to Wednesday with princess lunch booked etc. Is anyone in a similar situation and been able to get a full refund? Thanks for all these posts, keeping me better informed than Disney and the tour operators themselves!"
Bexters - there is an update on Magicbreaks site saying they will be contacting those affected;https:/…
That's my feeling too - but the bride-to-be is devastated and wants to go anyway
If you don't want to pay a fortune for the call there are alternative numbers of you use saynoto0870 on Google x
"So a little question. I am booked for June. June 1st to 4th. And I don't know what I should do now. I know that this is impacting a lot of people in March and possibly April. And I hope you guys get a refund or a free offer for a different date Should I try to cancel as well? Or do you guys think I will be fine. Because we still have March, april and may before june rolls around."
I think you have to April 15th until the current offer for changing/cancellations is to be reviewed for arrivals to June 1st?
Ive cancelled all plans for this summer now already.Disney and other plans too. This thing could go on and on.Better get in ahead of it now and write the summer off before companies go out of business or realize they are losing so much money they have to find ways of keeping some of it and then you get nothing back.
"Calling Disney for refund is a disaster!! They keep you waiting for hours!! Is there an email which i can send to, for refund?"
I emailed yesterday and it bounced back as undeliverable. I’ve given up trying to phone for now. :-(
We are also due to go on the 10th April. X Thai was meant to be our honeymoon with our children . Wondering if we still get a refund or is it open as normal in April . I’m not sure how they could judge that though
Been on hold since 9am. Anyone got an idea of how long the current wait is.
"Same, you with disney holidays?"
disneyland paris direct
"Disneyland Paris have updated yesterday's information about cancelling/changing dates. They're now asking us to wait till next week to call, even if our holiday starts in the next few days.https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/guest-services/exceptional-measures-booking/"
Nicolatarry120288 according to the dlp website anyone arriving before 1st June can either change their holiday date or have a full refund and they are waving all associated fees. They will even honour your current holiday cost if your new chosen dates are more expensive
"For anyone who booked direct with Eurostar, and was due to travel out between now and April 7th, they are now offering an e-voucher for the full amount. (The voucher has to be used before the end of June, for travel later this year.) See ""Coronavirus Information"" on their home page."
"I rang French number an hour ago- 0033160306053 ( Irish number was cut off all day) .39 mins later all sorted- full refund issued for would be arrival on Apr 2nd. Agent confirmed no fees to cancel up to Apr15th, initially was told free cancellation only applies to stays until 31st March or free rebooking . Refund might take a few weeks I was told."
Unless you are travelling before 17th March they are requesting you do not phone until Monday. The phone system in the region can't cope with demand and emergency calls are failing to get through to the emergency services.
"Just seen a screenshot from about 23:00 GMT saying park now closing Saturday 14th due to ""advice from French authorities"
https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/
Think it's been brought forward due to President Macrons update this afternoon limiting crowds to a maximum of 100 people.
"They’ve blocked incoming calls now so as our trip was supposed to be tomorrow, I just have to hope they’ll get in touch at some point. :-("
Does anyone know if the associated hotels are also offering a refund or allowing a reschedule? We have booked the Vienna House magic circus hotel and have heard nothing from them.
Meant to be going Monday was on hold 6 hours yesterday and couldn't get through. Hoping I can sort it after the travel date.
". their call center can t handle the situation and thats obvious. However i am sure that since they close all of you, you ll get full refund. We cancel our holidays on Wednesday night ,(we were supposed to be there from 12-14 March) and we rebook for November. iT WAS AN ADVENTURE to try to find them on the phone. But now that they closed even if you dont find them you will get full refund. dont worry."
"The ticket I purchased for Disney is only valid until April 1st 2020. I hope they issue at least a credit, I still want to go this year when things have calmed down. Perhaps they will just allow tickets purchased for this period to still be used on a day of the same colour for the next year or so instead?Edited: 3:17 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"i contact tickets company , they said my ticket (like urs valid 01/04/2020 ) updated to end of sep 2020 without extra cost and valid all date. including high / low season etc. contact them and make sure urs are too. good luckEdited: 6:28 pm, March 14, 2020 "

Hey everyone. Not sure if you’ve seen this but there is now a link where you can fill out a form to postpone or cancel your booking or tickets. https://contact.disneylandparis.com/Hope this helps
Thanks for the heads up...….typical French can not even put it in English too to make it easier to complete ….thank god Brexit means we can leave that shower behind
"Well as DLP is in France I’m not sure why you’re surprised that their form is in French, honestly. Some British people can speak French, by the way.In any case, up at the top left there is a little union flag; click that and the form will translate into English for you."
Using the cancellation link on Disneyland Paris website I have completed a cancellation using a translation tool. Not too many questions but oddly I am due to arrive today to start my holiday and the claim will not allow my to put that date in so had to put the 16th... at least it has saved me £40 in phone charges listening to Sacha Distel until I could speak to someone !!
I tell you why ....booking the holiday on their website automatically gave an English option so why not when there is a problem....you may speak French but not many of us need to so don't try and score cheap points you wanna be smart arse
"Ah, they have added temporary terms and conditions so any tickets purchased for a time when the park is closed can be used until September 2020 (on a calendar day of the same colour as original ticket)https:/…"
Any idea what are my options if I am no longer a le to be în Paris until september? I have 2 tickets for one Day-3 persons. Can I get a refund?
There is a little Union Jack in the top left of the form. If you click on that it changes it to English from French.
"Hi daytrip822294As long as your tickets were for use before the 1st of June you can either get a refund or change the dates up until mid OctoberEdited: 5:29 am, March 15, 2020 "
If you mean your tickets were for use in September then no there are no policy changes to any packages or tickets after June 1st
"We’ve been here all week and are waiting to fly home today. We bought annual passes for this year and have been really lucky to get 3 days out of them on this trip. We also stayed for the fireworks on the first night, if we’d held off we wouldn’t have been able to see them.It’s quite surreal to see everywhere so quiet and shops closed down. Tbh when we were in Disney it went from one extreme to the other, people constantly using hand san and washing hands after every ride to people who were coughing into there hands then touching everything in sight and not taking any precautions. We still had a great holiday and queues were bare minimum."
With the latest fco guidance against Britain's travelling worldwide has anyone had any experience with changing or refunding cost of eurostar and holiday through Magic Breaks? Due to go on 15th April but dont want to miss out on money we've paid
magic breaks have put on twitter that they have now contacted everyone travelling in March and tomorrow will start contacting those going in April. they are working their way through in order of travel dates.
People!!! Cancel all your unnecessary travels and stay home!!!DO NOT TRAVEL!!!If you are still healthy it doesn’t mean you are not carrying it!!!#staytheF****home
I want to refund my Disney land paris tickets due to the spread of the virus. Anyone know the procedure?
Go in their webpage and do it! It is as easy as that
A bit pissed of with DLP. They closed the park so we put in for the cancellations and they have refunded us £200 less than we paid (after booking direct with them). Looks like they routed us through a business as usual cancellation where you get a penalty of losing 20% rather than giving a complete refund as was promised on the web site
You will a full refund. Their automated refund system deducts 20% due to their cancellation policy. So they are having to manually refund the other 20%. Think it can take 2-3 weeks to get the other 20%. Keep in mind that they have never had to do this many refunds at once.
I have filled the application in DLP for REFUND on 16 March and still have not got my money!! I sent several reminders/queries. No response. Has anybody else been waiting for more than 3 weeks?!This is frustrating!
"Hi, i also filled in the form for refund onthe 16 th. On the 17th march i got a no reply email saying they are processing my cancellation; on the 19th i got a second generic email saying it will take 15 days . I have not seen or heard since nor received a refund"
"Hi there, can we please ask you to contact our Customer Care Team, where a member of our team will be able to look into any outstanding refunds or queries. Thank you for your ongoing patience in the meantime. Kind regards, ChristinaEdited: 5:20 am, April 07, 2020 "
"Hei, just relax and stay home....I was told to wait 6-7 weeks for may refound....Keep your home clean and stay safe"
"It appears to me that they are only refunding for the hotels and not for tickets. I'm concerned because the wording on their information page seems unclear. ""If you have not yet used your Park tickets and they expire during the Parks closure, their validity date will be automatically extended until March 31st 2021*. Please check the back of your paper ticket or refer to your e-ticket for validity date.""I purchased my ticket in February for May 11. The ticket expires June 30, 2020. So by my understanding of their policy, if the park reopens before June 30, my ticket validity will NOT be extended. Is anyone else reading it this way?"
"You're likely right. I just think the wording of their policy, in principle, is lousy. They should be extending any and all tickets that are valid and unused from the date they closed the park through at least the fall. And they should be extended for at least a year, if not more. Many of their guests travel internationally to get there. And at this point in time, it's impossible to know when international vacation/holiday travel will be feasible again."
They told me up to 45 days. You got to remember they are working on reduced staff and have thousands of people to refund.
I cancel our trip end of MARCH!!! still nothing!!
