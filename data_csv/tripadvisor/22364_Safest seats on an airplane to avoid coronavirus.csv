"So it really depends on where the infected person is sitting. Like, 99% matters.Looking for the article on how to identify an infected person, that will be much more helpful."
"All what it says is:- if you sit close to an infected person, bad luck- the more you walk around, or an infected person, the higher the risk to get an infection- personal hygiene is important (cleaning hands, do not touch your mouth with your hands).- avoid touching surfaces or clean them before (esp. tray table), and clean the hands after touching.Right. Who would have thought that?What it misses out:- the length of a flight (the longer it takes, the more time you spend and the more likely you will walk around)- airflow is from front to backWhat it totally misses out: It is public transportation. You can fetch a virus also in a train, bus, metro and at your workplace and wherever you are together with other people."
Isn't the fact the air is recirculated a bit of an elephant in the room here?
So is this any different from how you could get or avoid catching a cold or flu from any other passenger on your same aircraft?SWT
The truth about Coronavirus:It's actually Greta Thunberg's secret weapon to get us all flying less.
"What Greta hasn’t yet realised is that the planet is fighting back. A population cull through famine and pestilence will achieve more than her wildest dreams.Next up, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse!"
what a weird article. of course a window seat will be safest as obviously you only have one person beside you !
"Phil_Dubai, you may think the instructions are too simplistic but you would be amazed if you realised how many people go through life totally ignoring the most basic elements of personal care snd hygiene ..... never touch the peanuts in the dish on the bar!In the lottery of infection the Swiss Cheese principle applies. When all the holes in your defences line up, you may get unlucky. So that includes personal health and susceptibility, exposure to the infection, it’s virulence, how quickly you are diagnosed and treated, And so on. How far you go to mitigate your risk depends on your own attitude. Some risks you can alter, some you can’t, but there is no such thing as risk free."
This article is probably the dumbest article I’ve read in at least a few days.
"#5 what a shame that TA doesn't have the possibility to give ""likes"". Love your comment!"
"So infected persons must be allocated seat 14C? Otherwise the whole house of cards collapses; a classic example of bad scientific method.Wouldn't the safest seats be in the cockpit?Edited: 7:03 am, February 03, 2020 "
"Why not drop the oxygen masks? Seriously, they should distribute little bottles of hand disinfectant. I really fear for the FA's."
Pilot's seat is the safest- from almost everything. From terrorist people to terrorist viruses to nasty passengers. That is a blast door separating them from everything. :-)))+1 to 11

the pilots seat is not guaranteed to be the safest seat in the aircraft........if the co pilot comes from wuhan !
"The coronavirus infection isn't a serious threat for an otherwise healthy adult. More would be accomplished with limiting exposure for the unhealthy adult and let the masses feel ill for a few days. Nearly100,000 people die of the flu in the USA each year and the masses still avoid flu shots."
"<< Nearly100,000 people die of the flu in the USA each year and the masses still avoid flu shots.>>Where are you getting your figures from? There are nowhere near that many deaths in the USA each year. Maybe world-wide, but certainly not just in the US. Suggest you look at the following page from the CDC which gives statistics for various years.https:/…2018-2019.htmlAnd also the current CDC estimates for the 2019-2020 season. Currently the estimate is somewhere between 8200 and 10000.https:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm"
"Safest seat,and free from viruses,is behind the pilot in an open seater like a chipmunk - loads of fresh air although the loo could be a problem.SS"
"barb. the figures in the estimates show 34,000 + deaths. that is still 3000 per month in the states which is small compared to china. so in context, 200 in china in a month in china, is a hell of a lot better than 3000 in a much smaller country. and i certainly saw the estimated number for JANUARY in the states was around 8000 in the states. but as you can prove anything with numbers, i do not know where the estimates are obtained from.Edited: 12:52 pm, February 03, 2020 "
Relying on any figures officially reported by China is a fools errand.
Completely agree #20
Get a window seat so you can open the window for some fresh air.

"Folks, I need some urgent advice. I’m about to get on an A380 CDG-ICN. I’ll be upstairs in Business. Do you think it will be safe to walk up to the bar for a drink? We’ll be flying over a bit of China as well. What drink do you advice for ultimate safety?"
I think drinking corona is probably the best drink for the situation.
">>Safest seat,and free from viruses,is behind the pilot in an open seater like a chipmunk <<Call me pedantic, but Chipmunks aren't open. . . try a Tiger Moth!"
"'When all the holes in your defences line up, you may get unlucky. So that includes personal health and susceptibility, exposure to the infection, it’s virulence, how quickly you are diagnosed and treated, And so on' Agree - sometimes bad things happen no matter the mitigating factors.Flu jabs are a very good thing. Those who've had a mild response to nCoV should have developed antibodies to it, also a good thing.In terms of what to have in the bar when flying over China, a 'half' of Champagne would be a good start ;)"
"JohnE (post 24) - nah, you will be fine in business class upstairs - I heard a rumour that the virus prefers the lower deck .Edited: 2:36 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"For those who likes statistics, the Canadian numbers are, in a given year, on average 13000 are admitted to hospitals with flu and on average 3500 die. That is nearly 30% fatality rate. So far corona is nowhere near that lethal. That is not the total people who gets flu, but the ones serious enough to go to a hospital.In comparison, about 15000 in hospitals from corona and 300+ deaths so far.As for the safest position on an airplane, may be on the wing. The OP article is just fluff.Edited: 2:59 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"34K deaths in the last flu season is a far cry from the 100K reported here. As of January 18th, the 8200 deaths reported are for the entire season so far this year (2019-2020) , which usually starts in Fall and ends in Spring (October thru April). Some news outlets are reporting deaths in the 10K range. Of course the flu varies in length an intensity each year. While the Corona virus is grabbing all the headlines here, I think 8000 deaths just last month from the regular flu would have garnered some attention. One can believe any numbers they want. Those wishing to strike fear into people (which seems to be the case of some in the various threads about the Corona virus here on TA), will always lean towards the higher numbers and shorter time frame. Makes for better press. Comment NOT aimed at you nakagoli.Bottom line is the flu and Corona virus are different, so you're really not comparing like viruses, especially since one has vaccines that can be obtained even this late in the season, while the other does not.."
"but barb, you are the one who is using figures to prove something (i am not sure what !) the figures on current deaths are those released by the WHO and so have to be reasonably accurate,the simple fact is that worrisome as it is, the death toll is not as bad as normal flu. i know that some disagree...i got a roasting on another thread....but even though this virus has a different number to the common flu, it falls within the general description of flu and is in fact being referred to as the ""wuhan flu""incidentally, the person who passed away in the phillipines, did not die of the corona virus, they died due to pneumonia which has not been claimed or proven to be as a result of the actual corona virus but of course, the media will always associate it .it will be interesting to see how this pans out, but currently there is not much point in using numbers to prove anything"
"Deaths of those who have influenza will be dependent on a number of factors and in some cases the flu may be the tipping point for someone who has a handful of comorbidities and can't cope with one more, with that person not having a long life expectancy notwithstanding a bout of flu.The pneumonia caused by nCoV will have a more substantial impact on those with fewer reserves to deal with it, and as with deaths ascribed to flu we don't know the history of the people who've died as a result of contracting nCoV.Those who enjoy generally good health and who have access to good medical care - something not mentioned about those who've died in China but it does beg the question of whether they'd seen a doctor and been worked up appropriately - ideally will have a better outcome than those who weren't in best shape to start and have limited access to care.Condensed version: there are a lot of parameters to consider with regard to the number of deaths for both flu and nCoV. As the situation is newish and data is still being collected it's a matter of watch and wait, and maintain the basic precautions."
"Nakagoli, nCoV is a respiratory virus causing acute respiratory distress and pneumonia like the othe corona viruses which caused MERS and SARS. The death in the Philippines is directly attributable to nCoV, pneumonia is the end point of the infection. Blaming the media for inaccurate reporting is, in this instance, unjustified."
"neo. i dont often disagree with you, but the phillipines event was reported as being under control before pneumonia caused actual death. of course, there CAN be a connection but nobody can be sure either way. and also, currently, the coronavirus is not considered to be as serious as sars and mers. of course, it could turn out to be as bad or worse, but you have to accept that media is more prone these days, to dwell on certain issues. for instance, we hear about total lockdowns in the likes of wuhan etc, but there are many brits and irish there going about their normal business and not bothering to leave"
"nalagoli, I have used the figures only to counter some of the erroneous information that is being posted by others. The amount of info is limited at this point and constantly changing. Everyone can believe what they want about the number of deaths from the flu versus the the Corona virus. Take precautions or don't. Those who already have medical issues or concerns should be consulting their doctors with regards to whether they should be flying at this time rather than relying on any opinions expressed here. ."
"Nak, pneumonia is not a specific disease, it is the overwhelming accumulation of inflammation and fluid in the lungs caused by an infection. It can be bacterial or viral in origin, or indeed caused by inhalation of vomit or other fluids. So in this instance, I think we can be reasonably confident that the respiratory consequences of the viral infection did indeed cause the death of this patient. Given that there is no effective anti-viral treatment available for these corona viruses, it's difficult to understand why they reported the patient's condition as being under control, but of course it is possible that he became dramatically worse very quickly.If you are interested in the respiratory viruses in general, you might find it useful to Google ""Prof John Oxford "" a virologist who has done a great deal of research on the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917. Contemporary witnesses give harrowing accounts of the victims, often young and otherwise fit, literally drowning in their beds as the fluid accumulated in their lungs. So far we have been fortunate that the more recent outbreaks have been nowhere near as virulent, and the death rates much lower.Edited: 5:00 pm, February 03, 2020 "
I like how current affairs never fails to turn ordinary people into subject matter experts.
"At least the air on the plane goes through some filters and a bit of a purifying process.The real danger zone is the terminal building. A lot more people, a lot more risk."
I am pretty sure bright colors seats are the safest seats. So be sure to pick yellow or red seats.
"# 37 Asif, This is a forum to which people from many countries and with many different interests make contributions. Not all of us are travel experts, but many bring with them very relevant knowledge and expertise from their day jobs. Even those who resort to Wikipedia can learn and understand. Arguably they will be better informed than those who rely on sensationalist media, particularly if they take the trouble to follow links to CDC , WHO etc."
If you do not want to die fro a virus caused illness you'd better avoid any NYC-DC plane in this time of the year than any Peking-DC plane.
I have been quite seek after flying . Was a bad cold but was two years ago. So no Covid. Now I have to go back to Britain and waiting to see how covid is going. In any way I have a 3M N95 mask and another one with a 3M 100 filter plus swimming goggles a set up which I would only use if a coughing person is on the flight. Using a Boeing 787. You know they look at you as a martian!
"It's really interesting to see the ""it's not as bad as the 'flu"" posts from just a few weeks back.If you look at numbers for the USA, there have been to-date (according to the Johns Hopkins numbers) 61,547 deaths in the USA in one MONTH due to the Corona virus. For the last year that the CDC published a leading causes of death indicator, in 2017 ( https:/…leading-causes-of-death.htm ) there were 55,672 in one YEAR.I don't think that anybody believes that the numbers would have been LOWER if we hadn't done social distancing and most experts believe that it would be a lot higher.So the ""experts"" predicting that this was far worse than the flu have been vindicated, apparently."
