Just wondering if anyone still has their trip booked for May.
"I haven’t! I have a trip planned for Mother’s Day weekend. I expect to have to cancel, but I’m holding out hope."
"We have a trip planned in May... not to TCI but to Italy. Of course, I fully expect that it will be cancelled. We have a cruise (Windstar) and escorted tour of Italy (Collette). I am waiting for them to cancel. If I cancel, we lose the deposit or up to 30%of the cost of the tour. If they cancel (which I believe they surely must) we get a full refund or a good deal on a future cruise/tour credit. Although the airlines are being pretty flexible, there again, you are better off if the airline cancels a flight rather than you cancel it.I realize that people with reservations at most TCI resorts don't have quite as much flexibility, but something to consider if it makes sense for you."
"I have great flexibility with the hotel I am booked with. My airline is still booked but offers free cancellation. As of right now it looks like very few people have cancelled their flight. I am 400 miles from New York City. I have decided that if I can't go when I am booked this year, I will wait until next year to travel there and just let them hold my deposit if they let me have it for the same rate. I was feeling hopeful as the CDC had it at a level 2 to travel but now it is back up to a level 3."
"We are booked in early May and have not cancelled yet. We still have time before we officially need to do so. Having said that, we know that we will not be going in May. We would like to rebook for late summer and are waiting for things settle before doing so. However, there is no way to know at this point when things in the world will be back to anything remotely normal. I have contacted the place we stay and let them know our intentions. Fortunately, we have some flexibility and are more than happy to rebook for late summer. Obviously, not everybody can be that flexible and may need to cancel outright. It is a crazy time. I hope that all is well on the island. This is going to be a tough time for the locals and local businesses that’s livelihood is depending tourists..."
"We were suppose to fly out tomorrow for a 3 wk stay. Hoping that we can return in November for 3-4 wks to celebrate our anniversary.Sending good thoughts to all of the good people of TCI. Stay safe, stay healthy."
Three trips cancelled. Florida for 6 weeks of retirement camp. New Mexico my wife's business trip . And finally Grand Cayman for our 30th anniversary trip. Only having a little trouble with Expedia but if the place is quarantined it's quarantined. It'll work itself out. Plus I'm getting good at cancellations. So I got that going for me.
"Booked for 2 weeks, end of May to mid June. Haven't cancelled yet but am realistic that it probably won't happen. Paid with points and am waiting for Air Canada to notify us. Losing points is nothing compared to the loss being experienced by so many right now all over the world, especially our neighbours in the U.S. My heart hurts for all. Stay safe everyone and be kind to one another!"
I just found out after calling AA airlines that I have to take my travel by Dec 2020.
Jet blue just extended their travel window to 18 months. Perhaps other airlines will follow.
I was just looking at flights in May for people who have postponed their trips and want to rebook. Great no change fees but have you all seen the prices that you would have to pay. Hope i am doing something wrong.
"I dunno tewks, I just looked at AA on our dates and basic economy round trip is $247 all in with taxes. Cheapest ever. We had some friends just book that same fare for July. No change fees too."
"The US President is considering enacting an enforceable quarantine on all of New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. https:/…"
"joeb, i don't know what i am doing wrong, but every time i go on it says this. Doesn't make sense."
"Vacay567,Sounds like Fake News to me. How could they possibly enforce the blocking of all roads in or out of the tri-state area? Airports and trains, sure. But not roads. In fact, I thought the MTA should have provided healthcare worker only trains/subways a long time ago. Yet in Rhode Island, apparently their Governor has completely forgotten that we have a Constitution:https:/…"
It definitely isn’t fake news. It is a hot spot. More than half of the corona cases are centered in that area. We will know soon how it is going to be handled.
"Vacay567,I live in that hotspot and at this point it is definitely fake news trying to stir up fear . There are 15 confirmed cases in my little village of 7,000 alone. Our IGA is shut down this weekend for a thorough cleaning. I have been at home and in my yard exclusively for 3 weeks now. Just because Trump says he's ""considering"" something doesn't mean he's going to go ahead with it. Futhermore, Cuomo is not happy with his postulating. Did you read the link I posted about Rhode Island?"
No I didn't see your post on Rhode Island. So there aren't really that many cases in the New York City area? Is that what you are saying?
"No, that's not what I'm saying. Forget it."
"As I said, Vacay567 was taking up the fake news media's attempt to scare people. https:/…"
"Stay well, Dr. Jim!"
"I thought this link might be helpful for anyone still hoping against hope to travel to TCI in May. It doesn't look good. They currently have 4 confirmed cases as of yesterday. If this multiplies the way it has in other areas, peak in TCI probably won't happen until at least May 1st. Prayers for the beautiful people of TCI. :https:/…turks-and-caicos-coronavirus-covid-19Edited: 8:24 am, March 29, 2020 "
Thank you Lisa for sharing that link.
"From the CDC on travel to NY, PA and CT for the next 14 days. It is up to the discretion of the Governors of each state. https:/…travel-in-the-us.html"

I misread my cancellation ability. I only have until Oct 11th to travel with AA as that is when I first scheduled my trip.
"You're very welcome, Vacay567.Trump contemplates and says a lot of not the smartest things out loud. That's just who he is - the most transparent President we have ever had. The media, on the other hand, latches on to a 2 or 3 word phrase and runs with it as inevitable to scare the public. When 93% of every news story about Trump is negative, it's best not to believe anything the MSM says. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-yor…"
"Vacay567>> I only have until Oct 11th to travel with AA as that is when I first scheduled my trip >>That is truly disappointing. Delta rescheduled me for December 2020, no extra fees or rate increase, and I bought the tickets in May 2019. If you have been a long standing AA customer, maybe you should call them and tell them what Delta is doing and that you will be flying with Delta in the future unless they match their policy. Worth a shot."
"I did already Lisa. I am re-booking to mid July as I already have approved time off. If it works out great. If not that’s ok. It is what it is.Edited: 10:29 am, March 29, 2020 "
"Vacay567,I hope it works out for you. Good luck."
Thank you Lisa.
"While I haven’t cancelled my May trip to TCI, I just officially cancelled our April Spring Break trip to Puerto Rico. Major thanks to the poster that mentioned the possibility of getting a refund for airfare if the flight times were changed my more than X hours. The airline changed our flight from PR to NYC by 9 hours and I told them I was entitled to a refund and it worked! I really do appreciate most of the info I get on this forum!"
TCI dreamin I ended up re-booking but I will watch for my booking to be changed or canceled as I think it will still apply for me that I could get a refund. Thank you for that reminder.
"We are scheduled for late May (24-31) and have not cancelled yet. I am hoping with the rapid testing and antibody testing coming on line that travel will still be possible but I am tracking the date I have to cancel by very carefully. We have other trips later in the summer (Switzerland, Russia, Greece) I am more optimistic about."
"Rebecca that is how it is for me. I have other traveling going on. I re-booked to mid July so if my airline does not cancel, I will be going, I only had until Oct with AA that they would allow me to change. One thing I am looking forward to with going in July will be the warm water."
