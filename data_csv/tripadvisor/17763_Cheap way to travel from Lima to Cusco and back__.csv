"I am looking at flights for August 2011, from Lima to Cucso and back. The rates are showing me a total of $1100!!!!!, for two people. Why is this so expensive for an hour long flight booked a year in advance? Is there a cheaper way to travel from Lima to Cusco and back?"
"Look at other airlines -- like TACA, StarPeru, Peruvian Airlines. LAN charges a premium to tourists. Some call it a ripoff.LAN prices are slightly cheaper on the Peruvian version of www.lan.com (just choose ""Peru"" as country of origin at start page, but put in your correct address later). The Peru version is in Spanish only. If you choose ""Base Plus"" fares, you will save a lot off fares shown on U.S. version. **Warning: do NOT book ""Base"" fares. These are for Peruvian residents only & you will be charged a fine of $178.50 each way. Base and Base Plus fares do not show up of U.S. version of www.lan.com.Or, you can take a bus for much less $$ than flying. However, the bus ride is 22+ hours over twisting mountain roads, dangerous."
www.peruvianairlines.pewww.starperu.comwww.taca.comfor best prices LIM CUZ from $99 or so each wayin high season which is August.Avoid LAN charges tourists 3-5 X what locals pay a giant rip offfor which they are under investigation.US Airlines do not charge PeruAnos 3-5X what US residents payto fly in the US...they pay the same price...Therefore LAN is discriminatory to US tourists and allnon Peru residents.Avoid LAN if at all possible.
"Redhead47,I did a similar 22+ hour bus trip in India. Never again.....and I grew up there.I don't see an option for ""Base Plus"". Where do you see that on www.lan.com?AJ"
"qwovadis,Thank you. I will check out those websites as well.AJ"
"To purchase the BASE PLUS fares you must go to the LAN Peru (Spanish) website. After you have gone to www.lan.com change tyour country to ""Peru"". The website will be in all Spanish buts its laid out exactly as the english website and you can always cut&paste with GOOGLE TRANSLATE to help you. BEWARE....you will BASE as well as BASE PLUS fares....DO NOT purchase the BASE fares as these are for residents of Peru and you will be charged an additional $178.50 pert ticket when you check in at the airport.You can also try booking your flights with www.traficoperu.com which is an online Peruvian travel agent."
I'm trying Star Peru in October. The price was reasonable. I'll post to let you know how I found it (i.e. how hard I hard to pedal for the plane to take off...)
"So how was you experience with StarPeru, I am thinking about booking Cusco to PM flight for July 2011 and can't decide if I should go with LAN (expensive !!) or StarPeru (reviews are mixed, i am worried about schedule changes/cancellations)thanksEdited: 9 years ago "
"So how was you experience with StarPeru, i am thinking about booing to take Cusco to PM this July and cant decide if i should go with LAN (expensive !!) or StarPeru (reviews are mixed)thanks"
"I ended up flying both, Star Peru and Lan. Both were fine and quite comparable, IMO. I had no problems with either. Go with the best fare.BTW, make sure your tetanus shot is up-to-date and includes pertussis. I brought back whooping cough as a souvenir and it KO'd me for a couple of months. After I was diagnosed back home, I found out that it was very prevalent in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia."
"That is unfortunate, whooping cough is also having a resurgence in California, over 8,000 cases last year. It is declared an epidemic. They finally passed a law requiring proof of booster shots for older school children.This is a good reminder to everyone!"
"If you fly to Peru using Taca or Lan, your connecting flight to Cusco is quite cheap."
"I just booked a flight through Star Peru from Lima to Cusco and back in August, 2011. Roundtrip for two people was under $325 after taxes. We have some wiggle room built in for cancellations and flight changes each way.I used my VISA with the VISA Verification password and had no problems with Star Peru's website. The only thing it didn't like was my Hotmail address (no free addresses) so used my work email address without issue.Hopefully we won't have any flight issues with Star Peru. If we do, the whole point of the trip is to be adventurous...we'll roll with it!Good luck!"
Just recheck your flight times as often as possible!!
Thanks for that advice. We will!
