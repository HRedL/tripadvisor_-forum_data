Wonder how long it will be before they suspend Visas from the UK?
"Not long I wouldnt think, to be honest, surprised we were not included in this"
"there is a big popup window on the evisa site,due to go in 2 and a half weeks,doesnt look good folks"
"Just my luck!!!!!!!!!Booked 3wks in India,starting in Delhi for Golden Triangle your then ending in Goa.Had a cheeky weekend (29/2-04/03)in Alicante (Spain) which it seems has suspended my Visa and I it appears that I will not now be traveling to India at all.Not much I can do apart from starting an Insurance Claim"
"Due to fly to Delhi on Friday/Saturday. Went to the Canaries in early February so can feel your pain.Edited: 5:31 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"I know this is about eVisas and other visas, but am suppose to fry from the States to Frankfurt to Delhi on the 21st. Do you think this will impact that as well?"
"@AmazingTravelsSee this advisory from Bureau of ImigrationRegular (sticker) Visas/e-Visas granted to all foreign nationals who have traveled to China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Germany and Spain on or after 1.2.2020 and who have not yet entered India stand suspended with immediate effect.All aforementioned restricted categories of foreign nationals may not enter India from any air, land or seaport ICPs. Those requiring to travel to India due to compelling reasons may seek fresh visa from the nearest Indian embassy/consulate."
When I landed at Mumbai 10 days ago I was asked which countries I'd visited in the past 7 days.
"Better to avoid traveling now, few states (Arunachal, Nagaland, Sikkim) in India have temporarily closed entry of foreigners in popular tourist circuits due to Corona virus scare. Others may also follow."
With EU passports they wouldn't they have to rely on peoples honesty for this to work as you wouldn't have any stamps?
Kerala is already on lockdown.https:/…74567864.cms
If you have a passport with a chip in all that info will be on the chip you dont need stamps. We are due to fly out on 20th March but doubt it very much now.
"Yes they are reading the passport chips, Tui have been reading them and if you dont have a biometric passport you cant enter India anyway, they have not allowed it for years"
"seems pointless suspending the visas now, corona is off and running in india, all they are doing now is financially crippling business by stopping touristsEdited: 4:23 am, March 11, 2020 "
"At 14. The government is attempting to prevent the spread by limiting access to those potential affected, it's maybe a method all countries should impose to allow the virus to fizzle out at it's current sources. We may take a financial hit but it may save lives in the long run."
Might as well ban the 20 inr note perfect timing as the seasons knackered anyway
"The local and out of state businesses I talk to are all saying what a poor season they’ve had, are having, not surprising. To be honest given Jet Airways, Thomas Cook and now Corona all within 12 months they may have got off lightly, if the virus had appeared late last year they would have had virtually no foreign tourists."
If everyone in Italy moved to India there would be no Coronavirus in Italy. I wonder if anyone else has thought about that?
"Biometric Passport only includes info about an individual not there movements - happy to be proved wrong,This is from Wikipedia - A biometric passport (also known as an e-passport, ePassport, or a digital passport) is a traditional passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip which contains biometric information that can be used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. It uses contactless smart card technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is printed on the data page of the passport, repeated on the machine readable lines and stored in the chip. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip, making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented."
"Was wodering about that John ,when we visited Spain in January I'm sure my passport was just given a cursory look and not even placed in a scanner."
It appears there will be efforts over the next few days that governments across the world will require passengers to be tested before flying.... I can't see anything wrong with this... show any symptoms then you don't leave your source airport... arrive with symptoms then that airline/country picks up all the costs for your quarantine and that of those associated with your flight.... seems good common sense... No one with symptoms will be permitted to fly.
"What about the incubation period and the reports that not all people show symptoms, some are just carriers"
"We got back from Rome on the 12/02This morning we were refused at check in for AI130GUTTEDEdited: 11:27 am, March 11, 2020 "
"@22 - that's the reason why screening is pointless there will be carriers who have already slipped through the net. The virus is far too widespread now to start crippling the already struggling travel industry. Which no doubt, the tax payers across the world will need to bail out, again!"
"My understanding of the eVisapop up below is that although I live in the UK but have a german passport I will be refused even though I have not left the UK since December...annoyingly my evisa was approved yesterday... ""1. All regular (sticker) Visas/e-Visa granted to nationals of France, Germany and Spain and issued on or before 11.3.2020 and who have not yet entered India stand suspended with immediate effect."""
"I'm sitting here pondering should I be proactive or reactive.... I'm due to visit the UK for four weeks in early April... should I go or should I stay... I know I have been in the company of universal travellers over the last few weeks... have they been in contact with carriers or full blown cv19 patients.... I've no way of knowing.. maybe we need governments to shut this down.... close down all non essential travel... if your traveling like I am for tourist/family issues (a wedding)... is the trip so necessary I need to put my health or the health of others at risk....Conundrum or what.I'm no panic merchant but this issue seems to be more prevalent than anything we seen recently, and needs to be respected if the advice of the WHO is to be accepted."
"I would not go if it were me, you are better of there, its escalating fast here and it may well be that by then gatherings may not be allowed anywayEdited: 11:35 am, March 11, 2020 "
minor question. Would the Indian Government be refunding the visa's ?
"Ive just read on the Indian govt. website that they will be suspending ALL tourist visa from 13th March until 14th April. Such a shame, but understandable."
"I just received word from the tour company that our India trip has been canceled. Very sad indeed but fully understand...India, you will have to wait a bit longer."
