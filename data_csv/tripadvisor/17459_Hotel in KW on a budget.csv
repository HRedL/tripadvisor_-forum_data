"Looking for a hotel in Key West on a budget of $150 per night or under. Visiting Duval area. Also, if nothing meets our budget, how far away is key west to main area of Florida. Newbie here for the area."
"When? Prices vary greatly from month to monthYou really want to stay in Old Town and its not feasible to stay on main land and drive down every dayEdited: 6:26 pm, March 31, 2020 "
"The main area of Florida? It is a huge state. Figure 3-4 hours to Miami, 6 -7 hours to Orlando, 8-9 hours to St. Augustine, 12+ hours to the Panhandle.Need to know when you plan on visiting. $200 may be more realistic although travel may take a hit later this year and there may be bargains to be had."
"We had planned for mid-April, but of course that has been cancelled. As soon as the travel ban is safe & clear we plan to go. Not sure, but hopeful for May or June. We are first going to Kissimmee then making our way to the Keys"
"Where did you have reservations ? 150 in mid april is pretty much unheard of , for old town Key West.Or are you talking about next year? …. April reservations typically need to be made a long time in advance or you will end up with the most pricy rooms - if anyEdited: 6:51 pm, March 31, 2020 "
"Rooms for later May and June have some really good pricing right now. Idk if you will get a place near Duval at $150 a night but you could check some B & B’s, some of the smaller ones without pools. You could check Key West Bed and Breakfast, L’Habitation, my personal budget choice is the Angelina, which has a beautiful pool actually. We are rebooked the last week of May, hopeful the country is back up and running by then. But I’ve seen some pretty good deals on the resorts that are usually $$$$, not $150, but still way cheaper than normal!"
"Kristyn .. you are optimistic . Out here for us , the apex of the cases isn't even predicted to hit until may 18/20 and my line of work is going to keep me busy until the bitter end. We were supposed to go last week of april and first half of May but so far, we remain cancelled :( The sooner, the better ! Hope you get lucky!"
"Yes spammie I’m trying to be since there’s so much gloom and doom and I’m a bartender for one of my jobs in Ohio and fear if we don’t open by May we will not reopen at all, like many small bars and restaurants. Our peak in Ohio is projected in 2 weeks, which is mid April. Hoping they end our stay at home May 1st here, but it’s all prediction so who knows? I do think Florida was not as proactive as Ohio with shutting things down early so they may have it worse. Regardless——Stay safe out there:)))Edited: 9:17 pm, March 31, 2020 "
Florida is looking likely to peak in early May with the epidemic more or less over by early July. The state's sloppy shutdown measures mean we may have more substantially more deaths than California.
Thanks everyone for your responses. Sounds like we are all anxious for our country to recover as quickly as possible. May you all stay safe & healthy. Trying my best here in Iowa.
