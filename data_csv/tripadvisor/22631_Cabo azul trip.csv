"I have plans to be there April 21 to the 28th. I hope to go as long as the airline doesn't cancel. Have you heard anything as far as them closing, grocery stores or the surrounding resturants. Thank you for any information."
The whole world is shutting downPlease do your research And check your insurance Many places are under reporting covid 19
"Cabo Azul is in San Jose del Cabo, not Cabo San Lucas. Grocery store is still open, but restaurants are reverting to take out only. Not sure if the resort itself will shut down. The border is currently close to non-essential travel (which means tourists)."
Please Postpone your visit to Cabo Azul in San Jose del Cabo.Consider October or November.
"Going in May with no worries at all, I would keep it scheduled and keep checking in."

Thank you. That is what I plan to do. No word from the resort or airlines yet. It is still a month away.
