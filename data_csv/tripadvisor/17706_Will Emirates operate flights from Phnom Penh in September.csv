"Hi everyone, I just need to know if Phnom Penh (Cambodia) is in the next schedule of Emirates, Emirates is not flying from Phnom Penh yet (after epidemic situation) but airline website shows tickets in September... Can anyone tell please Thanks in advance"
"It's a little too early to tell for sure, as airlines file for flight slots months in advance then often make decisions on whether will fly closer to the time.For instance, EK files the following slots in Jun, which was their anticipation through to Nov.https:/â€¦However, what *may* happen is they file for cargo first, then open up for passengers closer to the time. So it's possible to book tickets BUT the schedule may change and you're then at the mercy of the airline to rebook you or amend.Strangely though, the flight is showing as 'available' ( see screenshot) so maybe that list from the first article wasn't complete or has been amended.https://d.pr/i/Vip6E6The top tip is to take a temp subscription to Expert Flyer to keep you updated of schedule changes >>> https://d.pr/i/Vip6E6Edited: 5:12 am, July 13, 2020 "

"Do you have any idea where can I make PCR covid-19 test in Cambodia for travel, because Emirates have a requirement to make this test before flying"
