If the SARS-CoV2 PCR test comes up positive, the traveler must isolate at their own expense, and will not be able to travel unless cleared by public health."
"That #2 under the ""A"" section (for getting a 2nd test while in A) is what really confuses me. As it's listed it is with the section on those that pre-tested '5 days' (or sooner); but as it's worded it sounds like it's for the whole ""A"" section."
"I'm still confused! LOL. So if you are tested in less than 72 hours and bring the paperwork are you done? Does the second test only apply to those tested between 73 hours up to 5 days and to those who are tested at the airport? Or is everyone having a second test? I'm getting so tired of sticks up my nose! LOL! I had to be tested twice before two medical procedures and then have been tested to go to AK. So I've had 3 tests already. I'm just going to install a permanent swab in my nose, kind of like an IV. ;)"
"Fergie.. you are perfect in being confused about that part.- As it's written (the order of the steps) those that are tested under the '72 hour' section should be fine; but in that 'part 2' it's worded/placed poorlyIn my 'TA Professional opinion' (which my wife holds in a quite low regard) I believe...- the 'OR' statement in the 'A section' applies only to the two ""1"" sections; and I think the ""2"" section applies to both the possibilities of the ""1"" section. - I'm saying this because 'B section' has everyone getting a 2nd test, and there's no reason for that logic to not follow in the 1st section.... and due to the latency times it makes sense to have testing over a couple week time frame."
"I'm proceeding with my August trip.I can get a test in GA no problem and supposedly results are within 24 hours.I fly out Friday at 3, so ill make an appointment for Tuesday before at 3;30, get the results, board my plane, show them the results then ill be good to go pickup my camper van and travel around (social distancing style) for the next 7 days then I get to come back to Ga where there are no rules and I'im good.Correct?"
"Lisa, that is the way I am reading everything. 72 hour negative pretest before departure and you are good to go. I assume the 5 day option is for those wanting to make sure they are not positive but aren’t able to get results back in 72 hours, therefore a 2nd test is required upon arrival at the airport for those folks. Tracy"
"Thank you, Scott. You crack me up! Thanks for the help as we try and interpret this. I guess they will for sure tell me Saturday when we land. I'll try and let everyone know how that goes and what I learn/observe."
"""I'm just going to install a permanent swab in my nose, kind of like an IV. ;) ""ROFL! That sounds like a good idea!I expect that the second test within 7 to 14 days is supposed to be for everyone, but that's not the way it reads. Parts (i) and (ii) should be separate from part (iii)--but who knows. Keystone Cops."
"We will be waiting with much interest, for your firsthand POV. Good luck, and very funny!The only people I know who have flown recently are slope worker friends and family, none on regular airlines for pleasure, and no idea what the procedure is at the airport....for real. Read plenty of comments from everyone, from those that followed the rules to those that just breezed on by, oblivious to the procedures expected. My guess is that our future visitors care more about the “rules”, than returning Alaskans, but again, just my opinion. Deb"
"Hi, me again. I called and spoke with Angela from the governors office about the need for a second test. She confirmed that:If you get a test within 72 hours, there is no need for a second retestIf you get a test between 73 hours and 5 days, you will need a second retestIf your flight is delayed, moving you from within 72 hours to outside of 72 hours but still less than 5 days, you will need a second test.If your flight is delayed, moving you outside of the 5 day mark, you will need to quarentine until test results are back.I hope that helps!"
I'm going to need a crystal ball to figure out when to get the test! Maximizing time to get the test back seemed like the obvious solution but not if a flight gets delayed . . .
"Thank you Garfield. That does help. Still wondering if you end up having to get a 2nd test due to flight delay, can you leave the airport or do you have to stay in the airport to wait on the results?"
"Thank you, Scott, for the info. One thing that has become a possible deal-breaker for our trip that I’m curious about is this...if we get tested with negative test within the 72 hour time frame (possibly difficult in our area as they are not administering tests without symptoms at this time), BUT you end up on a plane with just 1 person who tests positive at the airport and/or on their second test, would you then have to quarantine? For us, this possibility alone may cancel our trip as there would, at that point, be no way for us to salvage the trip and/or get any of our funds back. If we move the trip to next year (which we really don’t want to do as we already had a tentative plan for next summer’s vacay), we do at least get to move flights, RV rental, etc. without much in the way of financial loss. Such a frustrating time all around.For those of you still planning to travel...is this something you are considering? I almost wish it was test within 72 hours or nothing as that SHOULD eliminate the issue. My gut feeling is that most of the travelers will do that anyway, but there's still that chance, and I'm not sure I want to risk so much money and honestly emotional investment with that being a possibility."
"Kelly, Great question that I had not thought of at all.I called the governors office and asked. The answer was “more than likely” you would have to self quarantine if someone on your flight tested positive from the arrival airport testing. This is probably the deal breaker for us too.Just an FYI, I also asked about the 5 day situation if you had already been tested but it was outside of the 72 hours. The answer was “you can leave the airport but would have to self quarantine in your hotel until the results came back”.Edited: 1:53 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Kurt,You just have to leave ‘the reason’ out of your question and you have the answer. The rules are based on times/dates. It’s be like my middle school teacher that didn’t care the dog ate my homework."
"It sucks.... It all sucks; and my wife and I want to travel as much as (actually more than) the next, but...- as a society we are still processing this as life/health matters more than economy and individual pleasure- this is a completely new event to anyone alive and right/wrong decisions will have a multitude of unknown/unintended consequences. - try and be patient/nice (both well beyond my normal skill sets)"
"I think I understand, Scott.Edited: 2:09 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"I don't know how accurate this KTUU info is: https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/COVID-19--… , but at least they *appear* to have done research into many questions asked by folks, a few of which I'll post below. Last update was June 3 so likely a new update will be posted soon.Question: The travel mandates change June 6th. What's new?Answer: Quarantine and testing requirements are changing. Beginning June 6, 2020, travelers arriving in Alaska from out of state may shorten the mandatory 14-day quarantine if they have negative COVID-19 test results. Travelers who take the test and get results within 72 hours of flying to Alaska are not required to quarantine but will need to get a second test after 7-14 days after arrival in Alaska. Travelers who have a test within 5 days of travel can also avoid quarantine, but are asked to minimize interaction until they receive a second test result after landing in Alaska. The State of Alaska will provide vouchers for the second tests. Travelers arriving without a negative test result will need to quarantine for 14 days, or take a test upon landing and quarantine until a negative result comes in, followed by a second test 7 to 14 days after arrival.* * *Question: What happens if it turns out another passenger on my plane tests positive?Answer: You may need to quarantine for 14 days.Federal rules require airline passengers seated next to someone known to be positive for COVID-19 to quarantine for two weeks.* * *Question: Why are out-of-state travelers required to get a second COVID-19 test after arrival in Alaska?Answer: It will help detect cases acquired during travel.Tests performed seven days after a person would have been traveling to Alaska, or from their flight to Alaska, will catch approximately 90 percent of COVID-19 cases that would have been acquired during that travel window, according to Alaska Chief Medical Officer Anne Zink. At fourteen days, it's closer to 96 percent, Zink said. The state is allowing a retest at seven to 14 days to give travelers flexibility.Question: How is quarantine enforced?* * * Answer: It's not. The state has repeatedly said it expects people to police themselves, and that it will not use law enforcement resources to track down people who are not complying with health mandates. However, a person who is in violation could become liable - facing fines and poosible jail time -- if an outbreak and associated harm are tracked back to their actions.Edited: 2:16 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Thanks MM, it looks like a retest is needed regardless of if you arrive before 72 hours or 5 days. This is in line with what Scott was thinking and was NOT what I was told at the governor's office when I called today. Interesting, and confusing."
@4...Lisa...how about this simple scenario: you said that testing can be done easily and readily available in Georgia right now ......how about if we get a second wave next month and test are only available for those that show symptoms or healthcare professionals...then what is your plan?
"Also @ #4 Lisa.....” I fly out Friday at 3, so ill make an appointment for Tuesday before at 3;30, get the results, board my plane, show them the results then ill be good to go pickup my camper van and travel around (social distancing style) for the next 7 days then I get to come back to Ga where there are no rules and I'im good.”The last eight words in your post gave me pause, cause I’m in a state that had plenty of rules, we all mostly followed them, and now we had much lower numbers, BEFORE we started letting good in AK. So when you say....... So there are “no rules” in GA. Exactly the problem with incoming tourists and seasonal workers to our state. Folks coming from places with “no rules”. Sorry, but your breezy, could care a less answer annoyed me. DebEdited: 5:40 pm, June 04, 2020 "
Typo....BEFORE we started letting folks back in up here..... is how it should read. Deb
"So I'm curious about how Alaskans are so tough they can't catch COVID. For those who live elsewhere, you need to be tested within 72 hours (3 days) before going to AK. Then you need to be tested again in case you got it on the plane. But if you are Alaskan and you are gone for 5 days, you don't need any kind of test at all, more less two of them. I didn't realize Alaskans had such strong immune systems to COVID that they would need a different set of rules. A body is a body. Travel is travel. Why two different rules?"
"Ferg, that's not how I read the info. If the Alaskan chooses not to get a test upon returning, he must self-quarantine for 14 days. If he does get a test, he needs to self-quarantine only as long as it takes to get the results (unless he tests positive, of course), and then re-test in 7 to 14 days to make sure he's still negative.Yeah, I'm starting to go cross-eyed from reading these regulations too!"
Thank you! I was so confused! And then I was really sad that I wasn’t an Alaskan so I can have that extra layer of protection. LOL
"I’m also from Georgia and had plans to come at the end of June. We do have safety rules here, so maybe Lisa meant we don’t have returning quarantine rules. I called around several places and it was difficult to find a testing place with rapid results although I found one in the entire metro area. I was also hoping Delta would start their nonstop flights again but there is currently only a 5 hour layover. That really increases the exposure! With so many what if’s including not knowing how the fun things we set our hearts on such as rafting trips, glacier trekking, Denali and the fjords tour will work with social distancing and then wearing a masks for 8.5 tours in some cases, it’s best to just wait until another time. Heartbreaking but it is what it is. Hoping Alaska residents enjoy this time to have the beautiful state mostly to themselves. I’m sure that’s going to be really awesome!"
"I read that statement and it just blew my mind, so I reacted. I HATE reacting. I talk off the cuff too, so it’s ok. The past few months have been a real drag. Sorry Lisa. DebP.S. Thanks for bringing me back to my friendlier self rockermom. I’ve tried hard to stay friendly."
"Our local urgent care centers offer the test, but results are sent to lab and can take 3-7 days for results.Copays are waived, but insurance is billed as usual. Of course, things can be different next month..."
Are same day test results common? The 3 places I called said 3 to 5 days to get results
trek - same day results are not common. The AK state government is intentionally making it difficult for visitors to come this summer. They don't want to deal with it.
"All the PCR tests I found locally are 3-5 days. We can get rapid testing with results in 15 minutes but those are antigen tests, not PCR (which is what AK website indicates is required). As best I can tell, all the PCR tests have to be sent out to a lab unless you have it done somewhere where they have an on site lab to process. So then it partly depends on transport time to lab, etc. I think we are going to gamble on the 3-5 day test knowing that we have a long flight and we won't really be trying to go anywhere until 96 hours after testing (since we lose 12 hours in travel and arrive late at night) and hope the test comes back on the shorter end of 3-5 days."
"Deb, I always find your posts helpful and friendly! It’s stressful times for everyone but Alaska and Hawaii are in hard positions. You both especially have to take into consideration what happens in your limited healthcare capacity if outsiders increase your infection rate. As outsiders we have to be respectful of that. I did find one approved test at Walgreens drive through clinic in Alpharetta. They use the Abbot machines onsite so you get the results immediately or within 24 hours. It’s the only location I could find. It says they are a site that will test anyone but you do have to fill out a form to qualify for an appointment which you can only schedule a few days in advance. Check their website if you’re in Georgia."
"Is ""departure to Alaska"" defined anywhere? Because if you have a connecting flight I could read that as the time your first flight leaves or the time your actual flight to AK leaves - big difference with a lengthy layover. And what counts as departure time? Wheels up?"
"yeah, it sounds like they're making it as difficult as possible. hum... Might just wait until next year. :("
"Well guys, we officially cancelled our trip today. There were just too many hurdles to overcome. Fortunately, all the b&b’s, hotels, cabins, and tour companies have responded with great understanding and refunds. I feel like a burden has been lifted off of me. At least all my research and planning is done so we can easily reschedule for sometime in 2021. We have decided we are off to Colorado in 3 weeks instead. Thanks for all of your help and we look forward to getting to Alaska in the near future.Stay well,Kurt and TracyEdited: 10:29 pm, June 04, 2020 "
Check out the states FAQ pages…alaska.gov/dph/…
"Thanks for posting that link, Garfieldluvr. By far the most comprehensive info I've seen!"
Can you use a RT- PCR test? Those deliver results in 15 min as well and are available in my area?
"FYI just spoke with rep at Alaska Air . . .If out of state travelers are restricted from traveling to remote areas (i.e., King Salmon) and must cancel their plans to fly, the airline will only provide a voucher for use within one year. They are reporting NO REFUNDS until or unless the airline cancels the flights.So for many, it will continue to be a wait & see proposition.I'm still holding out with hope this onerous travel limitation/restriction for out of state visitors will be lifted before our trip to Alasks (7/11) and to King Salmon (7/18). But I'm frankly not very optimistic :(Regarding lodging & the water taxi in KS . . . I have received no response as of yet to my inquiries."
"P.S. And regarding travel insurance . . . our policy has an exclusion of coverage ""Benefits will not be provided for any loss resulting (in whole or in part) from:any government regulation or prohibition"" . . . so it would appear these events/developments in travel restrictions will not provide financial coverage to us in this scenario.Edited: 8:32 am, June 05, 2020 "
"Tlimeshare--what are you doing in King Salmon? According to the lodge where we are planning to stay, sport fishing is an essential service and therefore travel still allowed in our situation. Though they also indicated they were still trying to get confirmation from the governor's office since the new guidance has been issued. I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if restrictions were lifted."
"Deb, I meant ZERO offense, I am reading and making sure I can comply with the rules I absolutely do NOT have a ""breezy"" attitude. The fact is Georgia doesnt have any testing rules, that is just a fact. So my point was I wont have to have a second test because I will be back in Georgia. If Alaska tells me even though Im back in Georgia I still need a test 7-14 days later than OF COURSE I would do that. I was just saying since GA doesnt require one i ""am good"" does that clear up what I meant?RockerMom, I live in Alpharetta there is a testing site 5 min from my house that will test you for whatever reason.Also Rockermom I am booked on direct delta flight in August, so they have resumed their direct flights!"
"Daruwala, if there is a second wave and they change the rules back you can get a paid test from labcorp in GA. My step dad did it when it was required for his trout fishing trip. So they will make the free tests ""symptoms only"" but the private labs will still give you one (now that they have the capability, back when this started they didnt have the ability to do those tests on just anyone) So if I need to pay for it I happily will"
"Timeshare, are you staying at Brooks? Did you call them? I called my lodge at Lake Clark, and they are an essential business, so people can go there."
"Regarding my post(s) . . . we are planning to stay in King Salmon, as the base to do 2 day trips over to Brooks. We have lodging booked for 3 nights and the water taxi transportation for the 2 days."
Sport fishing = essential service...- I’m betting something here is getting mixed up.- there’s lots of sports fishing in many off-road communities and those off-road communities are still not allowed to have ‘tourists’
"Scott . . . I was surprised that sport fishing and the remote lodge at Lake Clark NP (Silver Salmon Creek) were both identified as ""essential"" . . . but it's so confusing, it's easy to make some assumptions that may or may not be true."
"Its confusing to me too, but that's what the lodge and national park said. When I called the governors office yesterday, they said that travel to smaller communities that are off road are allowed if that community allows it. Most of them arent.l allowing it. National parks arent really communities, so they are allowing people there"
"That explanation makes sense, it being a park vs. a community. Thanks for calling in person, to get the info that really matters to you, and passing it along to others. A question I had was if there is a current list of all the communities that are still “closed”, per community wishes, even tho they are allowed to be open. I tried to find one, because I hadn’t seen one. I just watch the news, and see random bits about places that prefer no visitors, and even being Alaskan, I have zero desire to be anywhere the locals do not want visitors. I doubt I’m alone in that sentiment. If I find one, I’ll share. Deb"
"Now King Salmon as I understand it is a community, so the same rules might not apply. When I fly into our lodge in lake clark, we land on the lake and walk to the lodge, so it isnt an actual airport. Regardless, I guess the answer is to call and check :)"
Deb-I had seen a list of municipal restrictions but now can't find it again so I think it does (or at least did) exist somewhere.
"We have now progressed into the true world of politics, where 'nonsense makes sense'...I can see both both sides (though I'm sure there are an infinite amount of sides). Mostly I hope a visitor that works so hard to get here; and then navigates these rules, doesn't end up missing something they thought/hoped they were going to get.I also wish, just for this year, they'd stay home. Good luck all."
"Scott, I am sorry you feel that way. I live in a state where we get a lot of tourists, and I dont feel that way at all. I get upset when people dont follow the guidelines, regardless of if they live in state or not. I work in healthcare and realize the severity of COVID. The lockdown was designed to give states/cities/communities time to prepare for COVID, it was not designed to be in place until the pandemic is over. If tourists (like the ones on this thread) are doing research to ensure they are following all the rules to keep both themselves safe and Alaskan residents safe, that's a good thing. There will likely be many tourists not taking the time to understand those rules and honestly, they will likely not have any interest in following them, and that is unfortunate. I will probably run into them more than you will as I will be in the same areas they are in."
"I find it interesting that nothing is done about protesters all over the US who gather together with few wearning masks, little if any social distancing, and especially in states (like MN where George Floyd unfortunately died) and where the governor has had very strict regulations for gathering in public. I guess protesters aren't susceptible to getting the virus like those in restaurants, churches etc ;-)Actually, getting COVID19 is not the issue - many have had it without symptoms and more are found to have it as testing increases. The issue it to protect the vlunerable who might get it - the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.Edited: 8:20 pm, June 05, 2020 "
Municipality listing...- here’s a link that may be what is being discussed as far as various communities go:https:/…- today’s Anchorage declaration is especially interesting. E.g. out of state visitors in cannot dine in a restaurant in Anchorage.
"I ignored Berkowitz’s press coverage today, and sounds like I’m glad I did. Sorry, Mayor B, but if I was a visitor, I would get out of Anchorage, ASAP! Thanks for the link, I’ll check it out better later. Deb"
"So what are restaurants, museums, etc. supposed to do: meet each person at the doorway and interrogate them to see if they've been out-of-state in the last week? Demand to see the 2nd negative test (at least 7 days after arrival)? I don't see that happening.... ""Minimized In-Person Interactions Allowed (Requires receiving negative test result BEFOREarrival). Individuals entering the Municipality who obtained a SARS-CoV2 PCR negative testresult from a test administered within 72 hours prior to departure for Alaska do not need to enterstrict quarantine. Instead, upon arrival in Anchorage, pre-tested individuals may travel around themunicipality with minimum in-person interactions for 14 days. Individuals under this requirementto minimize in-person interactions may not dine in at restaurants, visit indoor attractions likemuseums or theaters, or use indoor gyms. Individuals may use curbside delivery and take-outservices. Individuals required to minimize in-person interactions must wear face coveringswhenever in proximity to non-household members.• Restrictions on in-person interactions lifted after negative test results from testtaken at least 7 days after arrival. Individuals must receive negative test resultsfrom a second SARS-Co V2 test taken at least 7 days after arrival in Alaska for theminimum restrictions to be lifted prior to 14 days.https:/…20final.pdf"
"The only real enforcement I see happening at least that will possible affect me, is if Alaska Airlines stops providing services to ""remote"" communities not accessible via the road system.If they are flying into King Salmon, that would be an indication that community is willing to welcome & accept visitors. And based on that, we'll probably keep our plans . . . ""PROBABLY"""
"So if we're flying from Illinois to Ketchikan via Seattle, we'd need to get tested 72 hours before arriving? Does the 72 hrs mean when the actual test was administered or the test results date?  And then a week we'd fly from Juneau to Anchorage. Would we need an additional test when we get to Anchorage, even if we just spent a week in Southeast Alaska already?"
This quarantine situation and differences between State and Anchorage rules would be ripe for a skit on Saturday Night Live mocking the process.
Enforcement....- the enforcement is supposed to be by the individual- “put on your big boy pants” and follow the rules- now I get that’s not likely to happen; but if you don’t want to follow the rules then don’t come. If you are in your own home I could give two ships what you do; but in public there is a ‘social contract’; and people have to cooperate (supposedly for the better of all).
"So as long as you test negative 72 hours before DEPARTURE to Alaska, once you are there you are good to go as long as:-you only visit towns that are accessible by highways or waterways (I assume that takes Wrangell out)-minimize contact with people-don't eat in at any restaurants or basically go inside any buildings in Anchorage (except your hotel / airbnb)There is no need for a follow up exam after that?"
"Yes, according to Anchorage's mayor, people cease to exist for a short time after arriving in Anchorage.... I expect Anchorage to become the most popular city to visit in the world as people flock to experience such a strange happening! (Info in this thread starting at post #9: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g28923-… )"
aaahhh someone finally understands.
"I’m a little confused about not visiting areas you can’t access by road or waterways...I’m supposed to fly to Barrow for a couple days and then onto Anchorage after that, does this mean I won’t be allowed to do this? I know Barrow is only accessible by plane. It’s looking less and less likely that the trip will happen anyway, but I’m just curious."
"Melissa...Barrow is not on the AK road system, or the AK ferry system; thus, as a tourist, you cannot go there.(Mandate 18)Edited: 3:57 pm, June 06, 2020 "
I wish we would have some of the 72 hours/get a test/don't really go anywhere rules next winter when the snowbirds arrive.
I13JAmarym...- ooh that double-edged sword. I completely understand. I personally I’m living the peacefulness of this summer; but it’s coming at such a cost (e.g no tourism $s)We do a very short snowbird near you every year. A week at Coyote Inn in Palm Springs (February).
The problem is in the lower 48 it Is virtually impossible to get test results back in 72 hours. It is not right to mandate something that is impossible to obtain. Also the city mandate treats visitors as second class persons. Why would anyone want to visit Anchorage after reading the city mandate? There are much better ways to handle to both keep Alaskans safe and welcome tourists then these mandates
"USAtraveler, unfortunately this is what happens when you get politicians making decisions that are better made by health practitioners, or at least in closer consultation with health practitioners than obviously has been done to this point Fortunately visitors always have the option of not visiting (which IMHO is what the politicians really want anyway)."
It is my understanding we can get tested at our urgent care (rapid testing) no symptoms and get results within 15 minutes. Thats what we plan to do. We are in Georgia. Testing has and will continue to improve and become more available.
"Ah, I was afraid of that. Thanks for clarifying!"
“ The problem is in the lower 48 it Is virtually impossible to get test results back in 72 hours. It is not right to mandate something that is impossible to obtain.”- I think the non-14 day option is purposely not easy.- You have options. You can quarantine for 14 days.- if it’s important for you to get here then I expect you’d find a way to do what is being asked.
"If you go to a major clinic that does it's OWN testing, results should be back in less than 8 hours. They will tell you 48 hours to be on the safe side, but it can actually be less than that. However, small clinics still seem to be running 72 hours."
"@USAtraveler01: ""The problem is in the lower 48 it Is virtually impossible to get test results back in 72 hours. It is not right to mandate something that is impossible to obtain.""Either earlier in this thread or in one of the other ""quarantine"" threads, people were reporting they could get tested at Walgreens with a 24 to 48 hr. turnaround. I believe it is the required PCR test, but be sure to verify that. The test is available in 14 states with more to open soon. Since you don't list your location I have no way to know if your state is among these: ""Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin with more sites coming soon."" https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/covid19/testing#! There may also be other options. Phone around (including your health care professional) to find out.Personally I don't blame the politicians for being wary of travelers (whether just visitors or local residents returning). That is how the virus spreads. Had the politicians been more on the ball and put restrictions on sooner, thousands of citizens would still be alive.... And as already said, people who object to the restrictions can simply decide not to travel to Alaska this year. Hopefully by next spring there will be a reliable vaccine. Fingers crossed. We all want to get our lives back."
"Thank you For your support and replies. I am in Florida. So far I Found a CVS drive through Palm Beach County with 2 to 4 days turn around. No doctor request needed, you do have to have a reason, so a little worried about our teen. All other walk ins like in front of Home Depot were 5 to 7 days. At least CVS and these other walk ins are all free. We were going to do Anchorage Denali Seward, thinking now maybe Fairbanks Denali Seward if enough to in Fairbanks"
I'm sorry I have read all the replies and I'm still confused about the second test. So if you get a negative result within 72 hours of boarding you now have to get a second test? But 7 to 14 days later?? If you leave on the 7th day and get tested that day do you have to stay longer until results? Lehmann terms I guess. I get a test 72 hours before boarding. Anything else needed or am I good?
Shelby..... There is conflicting info everywhere. I dont think anyone knows for sure. Hopefully the state will clairfy. This makes it sound like you dont need another test --- …alaska.gov/dph/…This makes it sound like you do -- https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/
"For any more questions regarding Mandate 10, I encourage people to email covidquestions@alaska.gov. Telling them how confusing all this is will hopefully encourage them to clear this up and make it simpler. I'm tired of guessing what this mandate means, and I am guessing I am not the only one, lol."
"USA Traveler--is your teen over 18? At least locally, CVS will only test over 18. I have two teenagers I've got to get tested as well."
"@ Anne S. I noticed you are in Newnan Georgia. I am in Peachtree City! Peachtree Immediate Care in Newnan does walk up rapid testing for all ages above 2 and results before you leave. They are open 7 days a week until 7 pm or so. That's where we are going but I'm unsure about second test in Alaska we might need.Edited: 9:06 am, June 07, 2020 "
"@Anne S. I called them again and it is not the PCR test. Arghhh!!!!!Edited: 9:40 am, June 07, 2020 "
So someone here in Alabama said that the rapid testing at the Walgreens doesn't count according to the governor's office. Can anyone confirm that? I guess it didn't qualify as the correct test. We will only have 1 under 18 when we travel in mid-July but I was trying to figure that out. Thanks
"Shelby--yes, I discovered the same thing when I called around. 3-5 days for PCR results which you can get at Peachtree Immediate or at the Summit (or I'm sure at places in PTC as well). I'm hoping someone will have a PCR rapid test here locally soon. If you happen upon someone that does, please let me know! We need to be tested two weeks from tomorrow. For now, I'm just thinking we hope for the best on the 3-5 turnaround."
@Anne S. I will! At this point I think we will do the prior to 5 day requirement then we will have to get test upon arrival. If I understand correctly we just have to distance until results where if you do not have a test you quarantine until results. I could be wrong though. That is how I understand now. Lol. Good luck
"Shelby/ Shannon/ Anne,So there are different types of tests.. and the Walgreens one isn't the right one?I am also in Georgia, we can get tested here for any reason and supposedly results in 24 hours but I want to make sure I get the CORRECT test that will be accepted upon landing.Can someone confirm if the Walgreens test is accepted or not?"
"I believe the Walgreens test is PCR and fine. I would call and ask specifically if it's a PCR test but others are using it. They just won't test anyone under 18 so it doesn't help me because I have two teenagers who need testing. As long as you only need adults, I think you're fine."
"https:/…Not sure if this is just repeat information, for potential visitors, cause I’m not reading, as in depth as a future traveler would. My wings are clipped, for now. The Anchorage Daily News also has an updated article this morning, so I picked the news source I prefer, but might be worth a look at the ADN as well. DebEdited: 12:56 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Thanks for posting that link, Deb. A couple of points from that article that I've seen questions about:1. You can get a PCR test — the swab that goes up your nose — within 72 hours of your flight, and bring proof of the negative result with you. (Yes, that 72-hour clock starts when you get tested, not when you get the result back, confirmed Heidi Hedberg, the state’s director of public health.) ... The state says you need to “minimize your interactions” until you get a negative result from a second test to be taken 7 to 14 days after your arrival.2. How long will it take to get results back if I opt to test when I get here? - It could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, the state says. Hedberg said Friday that tests sent to the state lab were taking 24 to 48 hours to return, but “those timelines are kind of constantly varying.”3. What if my result comes back positive? - If you test positive, you have to quarantine for 14 days or until a health official clears you after a subsequent, negative test result, says the state’s FAQ.4. At the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, the state has hired Capstone Family Medicine to provide screening. “We’re going to have 58 people working 12-hour shifts supporting this project,” said Dennis Spencer, Capstone chief executive. In Anchorage, greeters will direct travelers to areas in the terminal where they hand in their declaration forms, Spencer said. Staff will also review testing results and provide testing and vouchers if needed. Spencer didn’t have an estimate Friday for how long it will take someone to go through the process. It was too soon, he said.5. The city [Anchorage] has defined what minimizing in-person interactions means. In Anchorage, it means you can’t dine-in at restaurants or visit indoor attractions like museums or theaters. You also need to wear face coverings when around non-household members. That applies to travelers who are waiting for their second or third test results.6. The city says people getting to Anchorage within 14 days of arrival in Alaska must inform their hotel or rental lodging of their quarantine status and whether they’re required to minimize in-person interactions. The city says businesses may refuse to serve people who are in quarantine or “minimal-interaction status.”7. The FAQ says the follow-up test is strongly recommended, but not required. However, the city and state say that additional negative test is needed to lift restrictions on minimizing interactions."
"@MM....terrific wrap up. I didn’t have the guts to try. Thank you. And thanks to Scott, overdue, for this OP, beginning the simplification process for visitors.I understand Scott’s reluctant feelings about visitors, and share those feelings, to a degree. Any hint of a visitor, sharing they may not follow the rules, by pointing out the lack of enforcement as a possible positive, and that sets me off. For good reason. I’m a rule follower, and I live here. Always have, and always will, so it is personal to me, that folks keep our home safe as possible, and if so, I welcome you with open arms. We all have to have each other’s back, with this crap. Strange times we’re in, and thank heaven for the Alaska wilderness. Keeping me sane, even if all I’m doing this month is lakefront cabin grounds work, and laying in the sun. Perfect. My bulldog is as happy as I am. Deb"
"Thanks Maple. Now I am more confused. Not your fault you summarized nicely. It says 72hr swap test but when I called my urgent care they said the swap test wasn't the PCR test. Is the health care provider confused? I can't expect them to be knowledgeable on intrastate travel restrictions when Alaska is even still trying to figure outEdited: 2:31 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Shelby, I think the healthcare provider might be confused, but maybe you can call again and try to speek with a nurse https://www.talktomira.com/post/coronavirus-…"
"Our lodging host in King Salmon just wrote us last night with this update:""Mandate 18 got updated and it not longer prohibits travel to ‘off the road system’ communities IF the traveler meets the criteria in Mandate 10 (negative test 72 hours prior to travel etc.) ""So it would appear based on what they're telling us, KS is open to out of state visitors and we'll be OK to travel there to head into Katmai NP.I also see Alaska Air is again booking flights from ANC to KS, which they weren't doing for a couple of days last week. So that too would seem to be an indication of clarity or lifting of the restriction.Edited: 8:51 am, June 10, 2020 "
"@Timeshare--yes, agreed. I've heard from several King Salmon-based lodges that we had contacted when our original one cancelled their season. Appears all is a go for travel to that area."
"short article on arriving at ANC...see: https:/…I've sent a question to the reporter/author asking if they had any indication on how long test results, for ANC testing, were taking to coma back."
"The reporter/author of the article I linked below (#98) told me the ""airport testing"" results are taking 3 to 5 days."
... and the airport initiated test results are not quick (3-5 days & longer!) article: https:/…
"Thanks for the info. That's pretty crazy actually Scott. I thought the whole idea of the lockdown was to ""flatten the curve"" not to restrict people for days at a time months later when the ""curve"" is flattened and hospital beds, ventilators, etc are not being stretched. For the majority of those contracting the virus there are few consequences. Let's protect the vulnerable and those they come in contact with, which seems like a better strategy. But then, I guess that is why I am not a politician :-)"
