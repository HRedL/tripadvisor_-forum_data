Tylenol . Any B6 or B12 supplements.Both for dengue.  Your resort worker will probably know several people who can use this. Tylenol. Not Advil or Aspirin or Ibuprofin
"Ok, I guess if their going to take something, it should be something important....I'll put it on the FB group,page."
"2) no matter what you say on a resort Facebook page, most will ignore when you say not to take anything...so, it might as well be something important....like vitamins....rather than the usual garden gloves, toothpaste....someone even made up 50 gift bags, they thought they were going to a birthday party...crazy."
Hola @4what a complete joke....world would be so much better without FBcheers.

CadysitaAre you saying there is Dengue fever epidemic in Cuba?
HolaAcetaminophen is the generic name for the brand name medication Tylenol - in case some didn't know....Cheers
"Hi, thanks #8 for the clarification - but as a postscript;""There is no difference between acetaminophen and paracetamol. They are two generic names for a chemical substance known as para-acetylaminophenol. All three of these are better known by its trade name (at least in CA) of Tylenol.""Just to clarify for others.Have fun."
No matter what you take ensure they know the correct dosage for age .
"If it comes from Canada they will have the benefit of two official spellings, English and French...somebody in the village surely will figure the dosage out :) Let's not panic DE deebob for CG :)"
"deebob #7: yes, there was a severe dengue epidemic in the Oriente about 2 months ago. I have no first hand knowledge if it has eased or not. Around Holguin there was not enough space in the hospitals to hold everyone. My wife was able to arrange to remain at home with medical care and self-isolation."
"I have not heard the word ""epidemic"", but doctor friends in Holguin province, as well as Santiago and La Habana have used the words ""crisis"" and ""grave"" to describe the situation now. It's estimated 60% of people in the Holguin area have had, or do have dengue now."
"My friend in Gibara reported to me in Sept that two of his grandchildren had contracted dengue. They are now thankfully well into recovery. However, he did not say it was a crisis at the time, but that it was rife in the Holguin region. Ray"
"In the last four weeks, 17 people I know well in Gibara have come down with Dengue. 5 of them had minor symptoms, but the rest were very ill. All say it was the most terrible sickness they have had in their lives. That's not to mention the dozens of others who have had dengue in the past four months."
"Not to be taken Lightly!I guess Ill throw and extra botella in the suit case.LuckyMe, I wonder if large copious amounts of Ron, in your case Absolute, could possibly ward off the title buggers."
"Resorts are routinely fumigated, more than in the smaller towns and cities. And people only tend to stay there for a week or two...so they are much less likely to be affected."
"Oh man...this is serious! Thanks for bringing it to our attn. candysita. Just to critic a little...a mention of a possible serious situation in the OP would've made it less gifty.Deebob DE for CG...I find numerous shots of tequila will ward off anything, even people :)"
"I did not want to scare people off coming to Cuba by stating false information about the situation country-wide. Perhaps it is not a crisis situation in Varadero or the Cayos or Camaguey, but imho, it certainly is in Holguin province, parts of Santiago and Havana. Every single email I receive from doctor friends beg me to bring Tylenol and B-6."
"Lots of areas have dengue. Over the summer schools in the Caibarién area were converted to ""hospitals"" as they run out of room at the local places of medical treatment."
