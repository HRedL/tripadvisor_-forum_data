"Hello,I am planning to cancel my trip due in Feb last due to Corona virus as the trip wont be as enjoyable as it should be due to the scenario.I am getting full waiver from airlines, hotel, sightseeings already booked with nominal deductions.But till now didn't getting proper reply from dream line cruise which is due on 1st March for 3 nights.What should I do, can anybody give assistance in this"
Cruise is not giving full waiverWhat should I do
"Hi Garg, unless you have travel insurance which will cover this contingency, I cannot suggest what actions you can take. Might be worth checking with the credit card company you booked cruise with if they are willing to cover the difference.Good luck"
I booked through travel agent giving cash.They are deducting 30% of total amount.
That sounds a pretty fair offer.
But why 30% also in this condition. They should maintain their reputation and understand. They should provide 100% waiver.
>>They should provide 100% waiver.<<Why? The corona virus is not any fault of the cruise line. You are lucky it is providing any refund.
"30% deduction is their refund policy. If I cancel before 15 days then 30% deduction.On moral grounds they should do, like other companies doing I mean.I asked to give credit voucher for 6 months instead of refund, but their also they are giving it for just 2 months."
"You already got the best deal, unless someone else has a better suggestion, take the money, say thank you!"
"I think that you're expecting too much. As said previously, the Coronavirus is not their fault and a lot of companies are going to be struggling to keep their heads above water due to this unforeseen event. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that some won't survive.So, I'd be grateful for the 70% refund, and please try to think of others caught up in this unexpected event because they have employees to pay and their own families to feed as well.Edited: 9:11 pm, February 08, 2020 "
"I booked my singapore+bali trip through Makemytrip. Makemytrip is not committing to reimburse if I opt for cancelling.Rather it's asking me to cancel first and asking me to bear the cost whatever their vendor charges. Since the package contains AirAsia filght ticket, Makemytrip is not all all willing to return airlines cost as they are low-cost carriers. How can Makemytrip responds in this scenario where genuinely poblem exist?"
Did you contact directly to hotel? I have booked through makemytrip.What should I do to get full refund?
"In the instance you do decide to come to amazing Singapore,I've updated my other thread with 2 useful videos to see what measures can be taken to protect yourself in Singapore.

"Unless they ownself cancel their whole cruise trip then you can get full refund. but most probably they will cancel it during this critical situation. Because I believe many of them like you ,have call them to cancel their trip also. Full refund shouldn't be a problem.Edited: 11:36 am, February 12, 2020 "
Too bad if anyone tries to cancel due to coronavirus and tries to claim on travel insurance. All travel insurances have specific exclusions regarding epidemics.
Please tell me how did u manage to get refund as evem i m struggling for rwfund feom airlines and hotel. But am not successful as of yet. My flight is on 22nd feb 2020
"Hi, could you please suggest how the flights are giving full waiver, since in our case we are being refused the same.its a India-Bali-Singapore-India trip. Please suggest. Thank yu!!"
"Hi have the airline given money back?We have booked through Flight Centre at Oxford, for Singapore airline to go Heathrow to singapor, they are offering nothing back, not even a change of ticket."
"I also booked the tour to Bali via transit via kaula lampur, how ever i get zero refund as per the policy of MMT,Can i get some refund?"
"Cancelled whole trip by my travel agent..Deposited 1 lac in 2.4 lac package..Deducted 40k Cruise deducted 24k, but they cancelled cruise after my cancellation.Nothing can be done now, nobody to hear at dreamline cruise"

What's the latest cancellation policy for flight cancellation in MMT?
What is “MMT” ? Do you mean the India based company named Make My Trip? If so then none of us know. If you have booked a flight with them I suggest looking on their website.
MMT = Modern Monetary Theory. Accepted sourced meaning.
"If it’s Make My Trip, good luck in getting your money backEdited: 3:19 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I have experienced a similar issue with MakeMyTrip. I have booked a travel to UK via MMT that was cancelled by the Emirates Airline. My past experience with MMT customer service was excellent. However, during COVID19, their Customer service has really gone poor. IVR and BOT doesn't work and any Customer Support via phone is impossible.I got 2 emails after multiple follow ups and MMT person says that Emirates will only give me a change of DATE and no refund . For a booking that THEY CANCELLED. I have spent more than 5 lakh via MMT in last 10 months and attempted to escalate to MMT senior management but to no avail. I would surely be far more careful with MMT in future."
"Please write to their customer service with copy to senior management including CEO Deep Kalra. They may respond to you (if you're lucky) and they will offer you extension of ticket only rather than a refund... if you negotiate hard, you may get lucky.Also, you may consider filing a case with consumer court"
It doesn't appear that they have a policy. All of their staff is currently absent and their IVR as well as chatbot are providing only standard automated responses. This is basd on personal experience of over 20 calls and chatbot chats..
"That's right .. MMT (MakeMyTrip.com) does not seem to be interested in responding to customers currently and all emails , calls and chat requests are going to automated mailboxes .. Even writign to their senior management is not being helpful."
