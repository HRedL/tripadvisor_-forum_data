My understanding is now the Azores is open with the option of presenting a negative COVID test or getting tested there. Has anyone done this yet? What was your experience? I’m scheduled to fly from Boston on July 6 and plan to get tested on July 4 here in the states. I would love to hear what to expect!!!
The new restrictions seems to last from June 15th to July 1st. There might be looser restrictions for your arrival date. I dont want to hijack your thread but Im more interested in anybody's experience from June 15th till the end of June. I am ready to drop everything and travel in the next two weeks...would like more confirmation if arrivals from the USA will actually be accepted into Portugal. Do the EU's guidelines trump Portugal's guidelines?
"Since June 15th the entry rules have suffered a slight change:Option 1 - to get a COVID test within 72 hours of when I depart from home - and the test is negative, and bring appropriate proof.Option 2 - to get a COVID test at arrival and remain in prophylactic isolation at your home or place where you are staying until you are informed of the outcome of the same.Option 3 - which is to return to the place of origin of your flightIf on 7 days or plus visit, will still need to be re-tested on day 6 from the date of the SARS-CoV-2 screening test.Official info available only in portuguese https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl…From what's in the news they have been rather strict with this, but till now only flights from Lisbon/Porto where arriving there. Never saw on the news that anyone had been refused entry in Portugal (Azores is portugal) based on nationality... so the feeling here is that, as long as you get on flight that lands on a portuguese airport and you have a valid passport you will enter, this was even the feeling during the State of Emergency. The EU recommendations are just that, each country is free to follow it or not."
"I want to respect protocol but I want a vacation and if I can do so, safely, I will come July 18th. Will restaurants be open for outdoor dining?I can get tested with results in 72 hours and would fly from BOS.Edited: 7:09 am, June 17, 2020 "
"""I’m scheduled to fly from Boston on July 6 and plan to get tested on July 4 here in the states""Make sure the results are ready by your departure time. Could be tricky....Edited: 9:19 am, June 17, 2020 "
Yes it is tricky but a night flight on the 6th makes it hard for the 72 hour turn around. Honestly I’m not sure if results will be available in time. My doctor says 3 days.
"Will restaurants be open for outdoor dining? They are already open, with restrictions in terms of seating capacity, so book ahead and you'll be fine. Honestly I’m not sure if results will be available in time. My doctor says 3 days - do the test at arrival, you'll be free to go to your hotel/accommodation."
"""do the test at arrival"" meaning at the customs and immigration area at the airport?"
"Considering how small the airport is, it has to be somewhere around there or at the luggage pick-up...."
"1) You take a test 72 hours prior to departure, results are not ready, you can not fly out - you are screwed2) You take a test 5 days in advance and are told that they are ready in three days but they are ready in one day and negative so they become too old for your arrival - you are screwed3) You take a test and it is positive - you are screwedTricky...."
Yeah and it’s 72 hours from arrival now I think. I’ve read mixed things.
"One solution might be to arrange emailing the results to you or getting electronic access to them. So you take the test 2 days prior to your departure, get into a one day quarantine upon arrival waiting for the copy of the results to arrive.Edited: 2:30 pm, June 18, 2020 "
Yes! The places here that offer testing email the results.
IATA updates their web site. Bad news. https:/…1580226297.htm
What’s the bad news?
"Bad news, if u r not an EU national. “Passengers are not allowed to enter. - This does not apply to nationals of Portugal.- This does not apply to residents of Portugal.- This does not apply to passengers with a long term visa issued by Portugal.- This does not apply to nationals of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, if they are arriving from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland.- This does not apply to family members of nationals of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, if they are arriving from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland.- This does not apply to passengers with a long term visa issued by Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or United Kingdom, returning via Portugal to their country of residence. - This does not apply to passengers with a residence permit issued by Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or United Kingdom, returning via Portugal to their country of residence. “Edited: 11:17 pm, June 18, 2020 "
Whoa! Are you sure? They were suppose to open up July 1 to North Americans.
You left out this part: “ 4. Passengers arriving in Azores are subject to medical screening and quarantine.- This does not apply to passengers with a certificate with a negative Coronavirus (COVID-19) result issued at most 72 hours before departure.“I can’t find anything on the Azores gov website that suggests other than their plan to allow North American visitors as of July 1.
"IATA is what airlines use, I think. Their info was only updated yesterday (June 17). It’s as up to date as it can get. I went to so many sources in the past few days. So yea, I’m pretty sure. I talked to TAP airline. They told me to talk to the Portuguese embassy. I talked to the embassy, and they told me to talk to the consulate. The consulate office told me that things “may” change in July, but “may” still not allow entry because of “reciprocity of treatment”.ReopenEU website is (still) showing Canadians and Americans are allowed entry. I was pinning my hope that they are right (and the consulate is wrong). They are the EU after all. Matters of border security is THEIR business. But I’m pretty sure they are wrong at this point. I think they will correct it soon. I emailed them. I also talked to visitportugal.com rep, and they were not sure. The referred me to the foreign minister office. I emailed the foreign minister office yesterday. I doubt they will ever reply. I heard they didnt even answer phone calls before they cut their phone lines."
"#4 is just about screening. If you don’t get past #1 and #2, you will never get to #4. Where did u see reopening to North America on July 1?"
"Hmmm...I believe Azores is autonomous in this case and as of July 1 North Americans can travel there with stipulations. Here's the document from the Azorean government page released June 15 with the new rules. It's in Portegues so I had to use google translate: https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl…Here's the part about options for those disembarking:a) Submit proof, in paper form, of a document issued by a national or international laboratory, attesting to the conduct of a screening test to SARS-CoV-2, carried out by the RT-PCR methodology, within 72 hours before the departure of the airport flight of origin, where the passenger's identification is stated, the laboratory where it was performed, the date of the test and the NEGATIVE result. In this case, and extending the stay for seven or more days, the same must, on the 6th day, counting from the date of the SARS-CoV-2 screening test, contact the county health authority in who resides or is housed, with a view to carrying out a new SARS-CoV-2 screening test, to be promoted by the local health authority, the result of which will be communicated to him; orb) Carry out, with the collection of biological samples on arrival, a SARS-CoV-2 screening test, to be promoted by the health authority, and must remain in prophylactic isolation at home or place where you are staying, until you are notified of the result. In this case, and extending the stay for seven or more days, the same must, on the 6th day, counting from the date of the SARS-CoV-2 screening test, contact the county health authority in who resides or is housed, with a view to conducting a new SARS-CoV-2 screening test, to be promoted by the local health authority, the result of which will be communicated to him; orc) Return to the destination of origin or travel to any destination outside the Region, fulfilling, until the time of the flight, prophylactic isolation in a hotel indicated for this purpose."
I read that document. It’s about health screening. Nothing about immigration.  I would believe IATA at this point.
"Avonord, thanks for posting and please update if you hear back. Keeping an eye on flights from TO too."
Will do. And I meant “foreign immigration” office. Not “foreign minister”. Their web site is useless and their phone lines are apparently cut. They do have a phone line that works but the guy refused to talk to me in English. Lol. https://www.sef.pt/en/Pages/homepage.aspx
check if Azores allow non european visitors. There are still travel restrictions for non-eu citizens to enter any country in the EU.
