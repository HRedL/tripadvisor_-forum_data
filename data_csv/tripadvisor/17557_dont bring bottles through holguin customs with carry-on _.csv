has anyone else had problems bringing rum bottles through holguin customs with there carry on luggage.my friends came back tuesday night and had 2 bottles of rum taken from them and the bottles were put with other bottles that were taken..they had the amount allowed and this is the first time we have heard of this.
"Yes, my husband's rum was confiscated last week at Holguin airport - we walked straight to duty free and bought another bottle. I'd like to know the reason why they're allowing liquids through except for rum??"
"If you go to your welcome meeting the rep should inform you of liquid carry on, ours did as this is something that had recently changed. A gentleman in front of me had his water taken from him."
"Not just rum then! Our rep didn't warn us, we thought it odd as on our previous four visits you could take what you wanted (within reason!) through."
"Di&Mal:Any idea how long this rule has been in force? I thought when mooog posted about this last week that it was just a one off, but obviously not."
obviously a new thing or a another money-making scam..lol..I will be putting my bottles in my suitcase from now on... Tip:- Save glass rum/spirit bottles at home; Transfer Cuban rum into plastic water bottle before wrapping in clothes in suitcase to bring home; Once home decant from plastic water bottle into saved rum/spirit bottle = = = lots of luggage weight saved by not bringing your Rum home in glass bottles... we do this every trip but usually carry some in handluggage; alas no more !!Edited: 8 years ago 
"I always buy my rum at the Duty Free in Holguin anyway, as it's fractionally cheaper there."
We were advised by our rep in Varadero that the laws have recently changed in Cuba regarding liquids in hand luggage. All bottles must now be packed into suitcases.
Looks like they have at long last fallen in line with the rest of the world.
Does this apply to any liquids?
Ours was even cheaper than duty free Bellagio - it was the free bottle in our room at PCV
"Yes, all liquids must be put in suitcases now."
mooog:Ouch!ddcuba:I would imagine so.if someone's water was confiscated also.Could it just be a super efficient Cuban Customs Official on the x Ray scanner?
I would think its more to do with clobbering everyone for overweight suitcases..... They're good at that ...lol..
"The rules that have been applied are the same now as the UK only 100mls in hand carry on. This is a very recent rule and applies to all liquids. Our rep said it had been been put in force and this was 2 weeks ago. It seem quite a few people were not told on site and were carrying water and drinks including rum etc only for them to be taken from them, the point of removal was when you went to have your carry on scanned."
"Well this is a bummer, I would often use my carry on to carry a case of Cristal when I visited Canada."
"""Could it just be a super efficient Cuban Customs Official on the x Ray scanner?------------------------------------------------------------------------Wouldnt have thought so as someone stated it now applies at Varadero too; we were OK coming through Havana in May but this has obviously started more recently than that."
One good point was that they didn't weigh our hand luggage ;)
"Our rep said all of Cuba now carries the same rules, sorry folks :S"
Sh1t .... that means I wont be able to buy my Lime Vodka on the plane coming into Cuba and will have to trust my luck at getting it on the return flight.... what a bummer indeed!!
"Another thing that was new - we always use the VIP lounge and take a bottle of water each from there when we leave - this year it had to be opened, not sealed. We were told we wouldn't be able to take sealed bottles onto the plane."
See there were some good points to Cuba's archaism..lol..
wonder why as per post #20 - you have to have an OPEN bottle and not a sealed bottle...?
"My water bottle wont be sealed if it is filled with Rum; would that be permissible...lol..Ahhh; yes, if you cant carry liquids (especially bottles of Rum) in your handluggage through customs then you would have to buy it at the airport wouldnt you ??? .... unless of course you have the weight to be able to carry rum in your suitcase, but you would be risking being overweight and incuring charges at the airport .... Me begining to see the logic in this new ruling now !!"
Hi Does anyone know if this is also the case for internal flights (Holguin - Havana) ?
The Duty Free shop should do more business. I wonder what happens to all the rum they confiscate?Party time for Aduana staff. lolEdited: 8 years ago 
"Oh this will be interesting to see how the Santa Clara supper duper by the book Aduna will be.There is a flight this Sunday, arrives Monday to see what happens there."
You can be sure that they aren't pouring it down the sewer. Must be happy days for the staff.
"Ask for a receipt for your confiscation, ha ha !!Good point BRFC, anyone ???"
"You can be sure that they aren't pouring it down the sewer. _________________________________________________Maybe, just maybe; they are using it for sterilisation purposes for this cholera outbreak/epidemic thats travelling around the Island... L O L ...Or maybe they are using it for precautionary medicinal purposes... L O L ...."
get enough of that rum in ya should sterilize almost anything....jajajajaj
"“Maybe, just maybe; they are using it for sterilisation purposes for this cholera outbreak/epidemic thats travelling around the Island...”*****Now, now LL ... watch those sarcastic comments or you’ll be voted off the island! LOL"
The duty free shop are now also sealing all bags containing alcohol with tie wraps.
"LoonyLou just buy your Lime Vodka on the outward journey and put it in your hold luggage for the return. I had 2 ltr of rum today in my suticases no problem.Also in a way, I know its disapointing and for me too, but this rule was brought in force for our own protections after 9.11 and I must admot I thought it ubnral that our aircraft would check us upon leaving ou country but the same plane carrying the same people back it didn't have the same rules applied. However knowing what happens in Cuba stays in Cuba, it does lead one to think that the confiscated bottle will lead themselves to the black market.Just make sure you put your bottles in your suitcases carefully wrapped and you should be fine."
This kind sucks a wee bit. I'll have to keep a few more CUC extra for the airport tienda then.
"With regards to post 20 I have known the VIP lounges for a couple of years to open everything including cans, I think the main reason is so you can't sneak the cans out of VIP to friends in the other areas, also it is known that folks will take unopened cans of beer back home that they got in VIP.Holguin VIP today was disapointing, they nomally lay on a buffet, today it was ham and cheese cobs, cheese and ham cobs or cobs with ham and cheese or cobs with cheese and ham ...that was it :S apart from the strange flavoured puffed snacks in huge bags they have everytime."
"Personally I don't see it as a big deal, as you can buy all your rum at the Holguin Duty Free anyway."
"I came back from Holguin on June 23rd and this new procedure was not in place at that time. We had 3 bottles of rum in our carry-ons before they went through the customs scanner. Nothing was said or removed. We bought two more bottles of liquor at the duty free and put them in our carry-ons. This new regulation is a pain. We always put our bottles in our carry-ons, never in our checked luggage, not only to prevent breakage but also theft. For us as far as weight is concerned, we have never been overweight going to or coming back from Cuba so we have never been gouged. We always have room weight-wise to put bottles in our checked but we would just prefer not to. So am I correct in thinking that the same rules apply leaving Cuba as leaving Canada (all liquids maximum 100ml ea in one plastic 1 liter bag) or just what has been posted here, i.e. rum and bottled water. Will have to keep posted and watch out for this new rule in the fall when we plan on returning."
"Personally I don't see it as a big deal, as you can buy all your rum at the Holguin Duty Free anyway.____________________________Not as cheaply as you can buy it ""In Town"" ....ha ha DiandMal; I know I can pack my Lime Vodka in my case but we like to bring home lots of Rum AND Lime Vodka hence why I like to carry some in our handluggage to ease the weight in our suitcases. Even though we transfer some booze into plastic bottles the weight still adds up; Carrying excess alcohol is Naughty; I know !!Edited: 8 years ago "
"I agree Bellagio, we can buy at the duty free but what about the complimentary bottles received at the resort. I guess they must go into the checked luggage. Does someone know the reason for putting tie-wraps on the bags containing liquor bought at the duty free?"
"LOL don't I know its naughty ...but definately nice :)Answer just wear bikini's Loony you should be fine then lol.In England they can be very strict, I have had liquid taken me because the size of the bottle was more than 100ml, but the liquid inside was less, as the bottle was a part used one. I have also had a can of muscle spray removed from me because it was 125ml, just 25ml over...and that was last year when I was in a slint, so it was obvious it was for an ongoing problem.It definately caused problems for some on todays flight anyway.."
The tie wraps is to prevent stealing.
"Wether they are complimentary bottles of rum, water or any liquid it is the volume of liquid in carry on that is the new rule. Any liquid over 100mls needs to go in your suitcase unless purchased in the duty free on your way home."
LindaBT:Not staying at the resort I don't get complimentary bottles. The Duty Free price is cheaper than the price in the shops in the town anyway.
as we all know the rules in cuba change all the time...........so dont be suprised if in a few months we are allowed to bring bottles in our carry-on....but for now its good to know so that we dont buy the 7 year old rum...thats why i love this site...........thanks again everyone
"Last trip, we were told on the bus that we had to put our rum in our checked baggage. We asked the Air Transat rep at the airport, and she said it was OK in our Carry-on. Maybe the transition had already started then (January), but nobody was really sure."
"Bellagio, the reason it's a big deal for me is because I buy rum that is almost never available at the Duty Free so it's way more convenient to buy it at the store and carry it on.In any case I just spoke to one of the Aduana bosses at Havana Airport and he has never heard of the new rule and laughed it off as simply another way to scam free booze out of all inclusive tourists... he's looking into it for me...Cheers,Terry"
Terry:I take your point if you are looking for a specialist rum.Keep us posted on the results of your investigation. I wouldn't be all surprised if you are right.
Thanks Di&Mal and Bellagio for the clarifications.
"Okay... to paraphrase the email I just received from Aduana in Havana, ""... regarding our discussion earlier today there is no policy to remove any of your belongings no matter what kind they are from your personal luggage...""In other words it's a carefully phrased ""no policy change"" without coming out and saying anything specific that could be an embarrassment if posted publicly.In any case backpedalling now and implementing a ""no liquids"" policy out of thin air makes NO sense. To their credit Cuba never jumped on the ridiculous (and completely pointless) no liquids bandwagon that Homeland Security implemented in a fit of misplaced hysteria and to all of a sudden embrace the policy at this point - more than half a decade later - is crazy, no?Who knows though... it's Cuba... anything could be possible, especially if it's illogical... ;-)Cheers,Terry"
Thanks Terry for that. However how can you argue with an Aduana official if he says it's illegal other than ask to see his superior?
"Bellagio, you have a better memory than I do... Didn't Air Transat or one of the other charters out of Santa Clara try this same stunt quite some time ago?Whoever they were I got all over them and eventually received a call and an email back from one of the VPs and the new policy was magically rescinded without further issue or explanation... I can't remember the details and I'm not on my home computer to check the emails...Cheers,Terry"
You're right Terry. It was Air Transat out of Santa Clara.
"But if it is happening in all airports across Cuba ................ reps are advising tourists,people are having bottles / liquids taken off them ??What exactly are the rules then ? As a tourist, I would just abide by the rules (in any country.)We were advised of this new 'law' across Cuba at our welcome meeting, but when we were chatting to Canadians during the course of our holiday, they knew nothing about this 'new law.'"
"""... But if it is happening in all airports across Cuba...""==============================It doesn't appear to be happening at the largest International Airport in Cuba - Havana - and it doesn't appear to be happening to any independent travellers flying out of any airport otherwise the Lonely Planet forum would be in an uproar.I'll stick with my guess that it's a temporary policy change implemented by some fresh, new, dumb boss at Aduana in the east or simply a temporary scam for Aduana officials to scoop a bunch of free booze - and it's only directed at resort tourists.Cheers,Terry"
"Terry, I have been thinking it is a scam to get some free booze. But then I'm getting to be a cynical old fart these days."
"I tend to agree with you CJ (that it is a scam to get booze, not that you are becoming a cynical old fart). Moncada Day celebrations are soon, and people will want lots of rum to party with."
"You can agree with the other bit, too. Mrs. CJ does."
"bellagio with regards to post 50 thats exactly what I was thinking. it isn't like we can all say it's ok because Terry the good man of TA says so is it lol. There is very little difference in price from the shop at the hotel to the suty free to be honest, for us what makes it better is because you can naughty (Loony's words not mine lol) distribute a little over allowance that way.As long as i pack it very carefully in my case I don't mind it going in my suitcase, my cases are locked tied and gagged in fact we have difficulty getting into them, never mind any thieves lolEdited: 8 years ago "
All liquids are being banned from carry on luggage exiting Cuba. This was told to me from an Airtransit Rep. 2 weeks ago so everyone be prepared. Its going to be just like when you exit home.
It certainly looked like an official policy to me. All confiscated rum (liquids) went straight into a huge plastic bin type thing - same as they have at Gatwick.
"""All confiscated rum (liquids) went straight into a huge plastic bin type thing ""Moog was this written on the side of the bin LOL!""Para la FIesta de los Tabajadores""?"
"lol Fidel! What I meant was the bottles were not being stored carefully, they were being thrown into an 8 foot high bin and were smashing."
My apologies moog -I couldn't resist!
No worries Fidel it made me smile (after I put the phrase into Google translate!)
Unfortunately I'm not going to Cuba for a while but if anyone would like to contribute a donation to help pay my air fare to test out this new 'ruling' I would be very grateful. I'm free to fly from Gatwick or Manchester on any date. lol
Make that a ticket for me as well please.:)
"diva:I only ever go flight only, you go all inclusive."
"I would gladly donate (for research purposes only of course), but I spent all my money on replacing rum :-("
mooog:Too funny. lol
LOL this is far to funny. :)
"I'm am just grateful our rep told us before hand otherwise we also would have had some taken from us. The weird thing is we nearly didn't go to the welcome meeting, thinking stupidly, we have heard it all before, just goes to show you how important these meetings really can be if you get a good rep."
The new regulation was being applied earlier this week at the Cayo Largo airport.
I wonder if it could be a different rule for those flying from Havana?
Buddy returned four days ago. No booze in carry on but he walked through with a Cyrstal in hand without incident
"Cayo Coco airport officials were confiscating everything that was liquid from carryons when we departed on June 30th. They even took the Vaseline from my granddaughters diaper bag. Two containers at the check point, one for the garbage and the other for their homes."
I'm wondering why attention has not been drawn to this earlier. It was mooog that first mentioned it 3 days ago.
"This is too bad, if it is a rule that will stay in effect. It will make flying out of Cuba just as annoying as flying out of Canada. Of course, there is the possibility that it will just get ignored in the months to come."
"I agree with CubaJack # 77. When leaving Cuba the only thing that lifted my spirits was not having to pack carefully. I just threw everything in my cases, didn't have to follow the ""liquid"" rules. Now to quote CubaJack, it will be just as annoying as packing to fly out of Canada."
Does someone know the reason for putting tie-wraps on the bags containing liquor bought at the duty free?well maybe they are trying to stop people drinking from the bottles they buy...at the airport...... when plane is delayed ;-)
The difference for us will mean I will have to be careful with weight on the way back home in my suitcases. My travel weigh scales though will certainly get used.Just to let you all know a 1ltr bottle of Havana rum in a glass bottle weighs 1.45kg
"When we arrived at check-in on our return home, the guy asked us if we had any liquids in our hand luggage. I asked my partner 'where's the rum?'. Fortunately it was in the case. (only 3 bottles). This goes to show that some staff will give you the opportunity to move any fluid to your case. Before we travelled, we were aware of possible problems with weight at the airport on the return flight. We took a travel scales that were not far off the mark on our way out, but on our return the check-in scales were 5-6 kilos LIGHTER!What a pleasant surprise!"
Cubatravelnetwork is announcing on Facbook that Cuba has introduced the 100ml rule for liquids for carry on.
It's great they have as they move a lot of tourism here in Cuba.
It's really unfortunate that Cuba has bought into this reactive and pointless policy like the rest of the world :-(
Sledge hammers and peanuts!
"So disappointed to see Cuba finally jumping on this utterly pointless bandwagon... to their credit they rightfully thumbed their noses at this ridiculous policy for many years... i wonder why they finally joined the herd of hysterical Homeland Security sheep...Cheers,Terry"
I wonder what has triggered this change of mind?
Was only told this on the coach. Cases ended up being over. And they wanted 150 pesos. Said 'no money'. Check in guy said 'okay' and let us go.
Ms_M-20:Best way. Well done.
"Just had the same thing on Tuesday this week; bought 2 litres of Havana Club at the hotel before departure and put in my hand luggage whilst the kids had water in theirs.As the hand luggage was x-rayed, we were pulled aside and they confiscated the Rum and the Water. I did notice that they lowered the rum very gently into the sack - no doubt to distribute amongst themselves later !!.We were directed to the duty free shop literally 10ft away where I had to re-purchase it. I'd paid 7.90CUC at the hotel per litre and it was 6.90CUC in the duty free shop so had I known, I'd have saved it for then.Interestingly - I noticed the guy in the ""independent"" shop in the middle of the departure lounge was selling it for 5.60CUC .... so I bought a 3rd bottle there too !!"
"butlersoft:Sorry to hear that you had your rum and water confiscated. It appears that Cuba has now joined the rest of the world in banning liquids in carry ons before passing through the security check point.I always check out the prices in the kiosks in the departure lounge before going into the Duty Free shop because, as you say, it is often cheaper there."
