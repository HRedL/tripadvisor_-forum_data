"Planning a 40th anniversary trip in November but really concerned about not getting test results in time and losing our deposit. We live in Tennessee. Has anyone in Tn found a ""magic"" way to be sure u get results in time?"
"I'm in around the same area. The best I've heard recently is about 4.5 days. I've known others that waited 10+ days for results. It seems to be luck of the draw. I think it depends on the current backlog which is pretty hard to predict. This is assuming you can even get the test, where I am most places will only test if you are symptomatic, in order to decrease the backlog burden. Frustrating but I understand why it's necessary for TCI."
"I know someone who did it at PassportHealth in TN and got the results back in 24 hours. You have to pay, I think it was about $250 pp. They went to TCI, so the viral test is acceptable.https:/â€¦Edited: 7:51 am, August 13, 2020 "
"+1 for Passport HealthThey are listed as an approved vendor on TCI assured and promise 48-72 hour turnaround on testing.It does cost $, but to me it is a small price to pay for peace of mind"
"Please excuse a slight diversion from the main topic of this thread....Has anyone seen any mention of different rules of possibly an exemption of the negative test and insurance requirements for people who have already had COVID-19? Although there is some discussion just how long immunity will last, it would be nice if a positive antibody test might be accepted for longer than the 5 days. Thanks"
I talked to my dr. today and he said there is a test called the abbott test which has a 15 minute turnaround. Does anyone know if this test is accepted in Turks?
It has to be PCR. Technically these tests can be run in hours. It's the backlog of tests that holds it up for days or weeks.
"I see what you're referring to, Abbott's rapid molecular test. Googling it there appears to be suspect over the test. Is your doctor offering it to you?"

"Thanks, Dr Jim... In my case, and my wife's, we definitely had COVID-19 (multiple symptoms and positive test). So did a neighbor couple (most likely from my wife and I). Of the 4, three had relatively light cases, but definitely not asymptomatic and I had a more serious case, as it got into my lungs more. We all avoided the hospital and my blood-Ox saturation bottomed out at about 77, but that is low enough. We all lost our appetites (the other 3 lost 5 - 6 pounds each, and I lost 10: I am now lighter that I have been since Jr. High school). I know that the immunity is probably limited with most people saying that we're definitely good for 3 months, possibly more. I was just hoping that being immune and unable to pass it along might make travel easier, but I'm not seeing any recognition of that among all the travel restrictions."
