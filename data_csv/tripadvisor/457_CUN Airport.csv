"Has anyone heard of anyone arriving at the airport, being pulled aside at the temperature station and having to quarantine? Anyone?"
"Bueller, Bueller?"
Arrived yesterday everyone passes by an infrared heat detector no one we saw go through was stopped. Unless you know what it is you probably didn’t even notice it.
So pretty much everyone following this forum knows of no one that has been quarantined at the airport....
Planning to go through on the 1st. Will let you know!
"RJay, thanks!"
Did you need to do any special paper work besides the usual customs things. Any questions for covid?
"Brian, others have said that arriving and departing passengers have to complete a covid-19 questionnaire. Carry a pen with you.Edited: 3:11 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Dr. Fauci predicts America will have 100,000 new coronavirus cases every DAY compared to 40,000 now 'if things don't turn round' and warns 'it could get very bad'......at some point it will get a lot harder for americans to enter Mexico until the virus is under control,,,, Mexico needs tourists dollars but at some point they have to weigh up the risks,,,,virus is out of control in america the EU have now banned american tourists because of the risk....if there is a new outbreak in the mexican tourist areas then maybe will finish tourism for very long time,,,,very risky for mexico at moment....they may prefer to cater to European tourists and not risk loosing them even though they really need the american tourism dollars........Dr. Tony Fauci stated there was 'no doubt that wearing masks protects you and those around you 'Edited: 3:32 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Mister, we arrived at CUN on Saturday, the 26th. There was NO questionaire to fill out, and as Joan explained to me, you don’t even know that your temperature is being taken. They use a scanner as you walk by."
"I know about the temperature scans. The questionnaire is for passengers with an elevated temperature, but I thought I read where other passengers had to complete a form.Edited: 3:52 pm, June 30, 2020 "
Post #2 on this thread reported about completing a questionnaire upon arrival...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…But it doesn't mention if ALL passengers had to complete a questionnaire or just that passenger.
Just talked to visitors who arrived yesterday and no questionaire. Also asked Cun employees with my former airline and they know of none.
Do you REALLY think the Mexican authorities are going to be conscientiously adhering to procedures???Welcome to Mexico!
It's Cozumel airport where arriving and departing passengers have to complete a form (I knew I read it somewhere)...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…Post #4 describes the information required.
"Hi RobertAre they doing the non-touch Temp on arrival?I don't see how that is even reliable with a +/- 4 degrees accuracy. My wife gets ""tested"" every morning at work at the hospital and her ""temperature"" always records 88-92 probably explains why she is so cold to me all the time, lol."
I just landed...saw the thermal readers but no one got pulled over. I arrived at Live Aqua and they took my temp on my wrist...which was odd. Hotel decently full....
"Yes, it is no touch. I have always doubted its reliability. I think it is mostly for show.And well said WT. Would be something new if local officials followed procedure to the letter. The same with traffic rules. My local friend always says stop signs are just a suggestion."
"Mark, From what I understand, temperatures being taken at the airport are taken with a noncontact thermal scanner, and it's recording forehead temperature, not core body temperature.While normal core body temperature is 37° C, forehead temperatures measured with noncontact devices will be lower -- more like 31.0° C to 35.6° C.Edited: 4:21 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"""and they took my temp on my wrist...which was odd. ""I've had my temp taken by scanning my forehead, wrist, upper arm and neck. Seems every time I go anywhere they're scanning a different body part. I can only imagine what part will be next, lol."
"Thanks for all the great info.If word gets out, everyone will be taking on Tylenol/Ibuprofen/Aspirin two hours before landing and all fevers will be masked. I hope not for everyone's sake."
"Is the liquor store open by baggage claim, Terminal 3?Edited: 5:50 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Right now, Terminal 3 is closed -- only T4 is operating.There's a small duty-free shop after Customs in T4, but a recent visitor said it was closed when he/she went through. With more arrivals, it might re-open."

"Duty free shop in Terminal 4 was open on June 27, when we arrived"
"Update: No issues with either Houston or Cancun airports today. There is a thermal scanner at Cancun and they did another temp check when we arrived at the hotel. We didn’t see anyone pulled aside.Edited: 5:35 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Arrived July 1 . There is a large thermal scanner you walk past between immigration and the baggage claim. To be honest, I didn’t even realize what it was until reading this thread. There is no forehead check by authorities. There is no questionnaire (I’m assuming if you get pinged by the scanner there may be).Our hotel did a forehead check before we got on the shuttle and a wrist check between getting out of the shuttle and going to the lobby."
"Update to filling out questionnaire: when checking in at kiosk and then dropping our bags off at counter, we were given a white sheet of paper with multiple questions asking dates of our stay, address of where we stayed, email address, and if we had various physical symptoms. Before we went through security at CUN, the agent checked if we had the form and that it was filled out correctly. At no point in time we’re we ever asked for that form. Nobody else on our flight was asked for forms either. Just an FYI."
