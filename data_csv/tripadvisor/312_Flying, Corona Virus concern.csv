Oh yes it is a concern .No question . Johnny C
Not worth it right now.
I suggest you stay home. However we will be taking our vacation without worrying overly about Corona or Dengue. The sun and sand are calling. Lenny
Numbers are pretty high. I can see reason for concern. However only 11 cases have been reported in Canada and no cases in Cuba. If anyone cares to send be a ticket I will gladly head down and assess the situation boots on the ground.
"cuba runs a tight ship. far better than canadian airports. they'll be screeing as people come in with temperature standards, medical personelle and asking about passports and trips. far better than pearson or montreal.carol e.Edited: 10:37 pm, February 23, 2020 "
It's not going away..
"I've been traveling during flu season for years. COVID-19 has not be shown to be any more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Go, take reasonable precautions and have fun.Edited: 12:49 am, February 24, 2020 "
Did a little research on the flu.It was difficult to get a true picture without further research. The stats were quite high but it seems this one is particularly nasty. A little extra precaution i think is a good thing but still it would not stop me from going to Cuba. If only the prices would just go a little bit lower.
I'd be more worried about crossing the streets of Habana.
Look both ways before you step of the curb for sure.
What does and iranian flight have to do with cuba ?
"I would not worry at this point in time. However, that is not to say that it may not be a concern in the coming months.Hopefully, this does not turn into a pandemic, if it does then it may affect travel plans for millions of people everywhere. Especially those who are older, and those with underlying medical conditions that may make them more at risk for succumbing to this nasty virus.At the moment, catching the common influenza flu would be more of a concern that Corona."
I will be going in April and as long as I take my bug spray I have no worries enjoy your trip
"hola :) For me? and maybe doesn't sound nice, but i think i'd be a little concerned if i was flying out of Toronto or Vancouver. lo siento. I was in the looooooooooooong slooooow line before Customs at the Toronto airport 3 years ago on my way to Cuba, it was kinda loco. And at the time there was a person 3 people in front of me, he shoulda been taken outta the line, sick, very very bad cough, loco, i even put the airport's hand sanitizer up my nose once i reach the Customs area. Just sayin. Safe and healthy travels! :) ps - i didn't get sick."
"@12 because it might arrive and discharge passengers at the same airport terminal you are flying out of or into, so you could be encountering people from Iran at customs or elsewhere. If this thing gets bad, avoiding public places like airports might be a wise precaution. I don't think we are quite there yet."
"# 14.., I don't think bug spray is going to help you with the Corona Virus."
Well I'm not flying anywhere at the moment. UK airports are busier and more crowded than those in Canada plus they have more international passengers so I'm not prepared to take the risk
"Just thinking out loud..., a plane flies from South Korea, Italy or Iran (take your pick) to your local airport and then that same plane is sent on a flight to Cuba, or wherever you are going.If someone has the virus and you happen to touch a surface that they touched on a previous flight and then you rub your eyes, can you not be at risk?I have heard different things about how long the virus can survive on an object such as an armrest etc...., anywhere between two to nine hours has been thrown around."
"hmmm...i was watching the tv and the ""expert"" said up to 2 weeks under ideal conditions. I assume in a moist environment I'm guessing."

"No deaths reported thus far in either country, as far as I know."
"At temperatures of around 4°C or 39.2F, certain versions of the coronavirus could remain viable for up to 28 days.At temperatures of 30–40°C (86–104°F), coronaviruses tended to persist for a shorter time....disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can ""efficiently"" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, according to the study. ""We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV,"" the researchers wrote, referring to the new coronavirus. But even though the new coronavirus is a similar strain to the SARS coronavirus, it's not clear if it will behave the same...."
"I think it's early to know how it will play out here. Italy and South Korea seemed pretty safe until their numbers just exploded. Time will tell. People travel so much and so quickly these days that it doesn't take long for a virus to hitchhike to a new country. Given the apparently long incubation period and the sometimes deceptively mild symptoms with this bug, it could move in and spread widely before we are aware of it."
Those supermarket shopping carts are disgusting at the best of times. Eeeeew!
"@26, true if you have community spread, which supposedly we don't (yet). Of course, the plain old Flu can get you at all of those places! But at least we have a vaccine for that which is more or less effective, but better than nothing.Airports feature passengers arriving from other countries, who may be bringing the virus with them directly. Initially that is how things started with all of the countries now affected......perhaps the infection first spread through contact on the plane or in the airport, or happened later, but the opportunity to contract the virus from someone carrying it is certainly there."
"@30, definitely can relate to your concerns and I don't think we are doing a great job here of screening or of transparency. Look at Singapore as a model of how to do things. They report on a daily basis of new cases, where they have been and how it relates to possible spread, they do meticulous contact tracing, etc. As a result their citizens have confidence that everything that can be done is being done to keep people safe."
"Its getting very close to pandemic effects globally.. too much NOT known and not being announced is rather concerning. Airborne check, 5-14 days on surfaces ? incubation period without symptoms ? How has Cuba prepared ? What will the changes to Canada's entry be ? My sinuses and allergies can put my temperature up. we cancelled and are staying put for now...."
Has anyone personally encountered screenings at airports in Cuba - if so what was the process ? Thank you.
"If we can make it to l ate Spring we should be in better shape. This virus doesn't do well in the heat apparently, and they expect a vaccine within 2-3 months that should be administered before the cold hits again. This according to an epidemiologist at Columbia University. Here's hoping."
"hola :) Not good. It is actually cow chit. Any info on this virus, i'd take it with a 45 gallon barrel of salt. No bueno!"
https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/3…
"Nothing new, Cuba has temperature screened for years, various airports, various times even when there has been nothing on radar. It is by new means new at a Cuban airport."
Yes I am wondering this too! We are travelling March 13 on an Air China flight from Montreal and trying to gauge what to expect...
"We are flying out of Toronto on April 7th to Cuba. At this point, I have purchased a small bottle of hand sanitizer and a small package of Lysol wipes to clean the area I sit in on the plane. I haven’t decided yet if I feel I need to wear a mask on the plane yet...time will tell. Other than that...it’s just a few extra precautions while I am in a tight space. We are all set to enjoy our vacation while this is going on."
I believe I have seen on the news many times that wearing a cloth mask is useless. A respirator mask with a filter however....

A chance, loco as it sounds. buen dia! ps - my city as sounds like many others are sold out of anti virus or drywalling face masks, but yesterday did find some to buy at Dollarama, whod of thunk, and made in China.Edited: 11:32 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Good stuff for a Thursday gerropato :) I just thought of one of those scuba face mask :) The more this goes on the more I'm thinking about it...once at the airport any airport, which is a international virus party btw, the defense begins...I'm only touching myself and my wife. Washrooms are like bedrooms for the virus...a good time for wipes for gloves :) Seriously, it is not getting better just spreading...how's it gonna be in a month from now? Sure I might be over reacting right now :)"
Larry boy....calm down.
I think its the countdown and the winter storm today :)
"HolaI hear you, we leave in a little over a month, are we concerned, for sure, but would never cancel my trip.This is not like the black death.....You are correct, it must be your winter storm, you will be in the sun in a few weeks....I think the more important thing to worry about will the hotel have beer....lolcheers.Edited: 1:24 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Right now, I'm kind of glad we fly out of London....never too many at the airport."
You had me calmed down rrrichar until the beer comment :) Not to worried really...at this moment that is :)

"Are planes from Italy still taking vacationers to hot spots in the carribbean? If so that would be a good reason not to go on my vacation. Can you imagine being quarantined in Cuba, they don't even have WiFi except in small areas so if you were stuck in a room you would not even be in constant communication with your family, that would worry me. Not the airplane but the amount of people from all the countries infected all in one area touching everything"
"""the amount of people from all the countries infected all in one area touching everything""Sounds like one of those hedonism resorts where anything goes..."
"hola :) reply #54 Manitoba, i hear yah! yup, many unknowns. es vida."
"The information for the Royalton says we can purchase WiFi which is only available to use in the lobby, not the rest of the resort or rooms! Perhaps I have it wrong."
I had a bungalow at Starfish near pool. Had Wi-Fi in room. Your Wi-Fi time would eventually expire though.
"I was lucky. Starfish wifi in lobby , pool area, snack bar. It was great, been to Cuba 10x. 1st time I ever did wifi.!"

"""Where are we going Piglet?"" asked Pooh.""We need to get supplies,"" said Piglet. ""For the Coronavirus""""Ahh,"" said Pooh, nodding in understanding. ""Things like bread, milk, cough mixture, tissues and cat litter even though we don't have a cat?""Piglet did a little laugh, and a sort of leap and bit of a cough. ""No,"" said Piglet. ""No, those aren't the sort of supplies we need at all! What we need are family sized bags of chocolate buttons, massive toblerone, jelly babies and crunchies and a freezer full of stuffed crust pizzas, and all of the Prosecco that we can possibly carry, so that when we get quarantined we won't mind it even slightly. THOSE are supplies.""All of a sudden, Pooh thought that the idea of coronavirus didn't seem quite so bad, and actually, getting quarantined with Piglet and their supplies really didn't sound such a terrible thing after all. ""Oh Piglet,"" said Pooh. ""I really do think you are a very wise animal.""Santiago agrees with Piglet."
"Oh, yes, supplies.... what others are really stocking up on is toilet paper, lots if it, so what my nephew says, who manages one of the Costcos here...flying out the door."
"But WHY are people stocking up on toilet paper??? Diarrhea is not associated with Coronavirus. It’s like Pooh thinking that he should stock up on kitty litter even though he doesn’t have a cat.Edited: 7:22 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"People do strange things...got to stock up, in case they can't leave their house."
"Beer !!Edited: 7:30 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Ah c’mon, SWNova. Suggesting that one should stock up on beer is akin to suggesting that someone should stock up on lobster … or churros for that matter. Doesn’t everyone have at least a month’s supply on hand?Then again … there are those less fortunate than Maritimers."
"Hand sanitizer is in short supply where I live. So far there has been no run on toilet paper, but that has been a recurring theme in other countries so why not here? I think confusion about symptoms may be one reason, but otherwise I suppose it won't go bad so if you have room to store it, I suppose people think why not? And once that sort of thing starts, people follow along so they won't be caught short themselves. ;-)"
"There were no Lysol wipes at Canadian Tire yesterday, the shelf was empty."
"And how many people who are flapping their lips about a shortage of hand sanitizer have even bothered to get a flu vaccine this year? As if common influenza isn’t going to affect more people (in Canada) than Coronavirus?OMG, no Lysol wipes at Canadian Tire. Close the store. Now. Seriously.Edited: 7:50 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"On the bright side the transmission of influenza might be a lot lower this season. And hopefully people will become more aware and informed as we go thought this. Well, that second hope is probably asking too much."
"Regarding no Lysol wipes at CT, I was just making a comment, I was just walking by and noticed it....that's all....not that it mattered to me....just thought I would mention that......wow."
We we are in Spring Break season so the really high season for vacationing in Cuba....maybe those maids will be gifted with toilet paper instead of toothbrushes and toothpaste this year.
Spring break. Virus transmission season. :)
I guess if you have to self quarantine for 14 days you can't leave to get toilet paper. Newspaper apparently works hahahaha just have to hope you have home delivery.
Toilet paper. Hilarious. Costco in Kelowna ran out. Went to Save On in Vernon all gone. There has been one case of a person who travelled here. Quarantined immediately. No other cases for weeks. Toilet paper gone in entire valley. People are weird. Leaving in 2 weeks. The only thing that worries me is our hotel is a favorite for Italians:)
"So now I guess I need to go out tomorrow and buy two of those huge packages of TP because hysterical people are buying it all up. And the people driving this herd likely don't understand herd immunity. I'm surrounded by idiots!Edited: 1:02 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Hi Lori,We are booked for April 19th to Varadero.....and, unless something drastically happens in Canada or Cuba...we will be going. So far,, Cuba does not have any cases. Fingers crossed, stays that way."
"Jungle currency is now the hot commodity everywhere it seems. I'm not worried about the Corona virus... bring it on! If I have to get it, I'd rather get it sooner rather than later to get over it and move on with life. There's not much sense in worrying over something that one has very little control over and is likely inevitable anyway no matter how many precautions one takes. The only totally secure option is to live in a HAZMAT suit, but that would seriously cut into my beer drinking time... so a no-go. Terry"
"I've always taken precautions every year to avoid getting the flu. I feel that those precautions should be adequate for this corona virus thingy. Haven't had the flu in years and rarely get a cold.However....It would be pretty hard to keep those good habits up in a resort, where everything is shared communally. The chairs, the tables, counters, doors, handles, bathrooms. Even the TV remote, phone, fridge handle, in your room (especially the TV remote) is probably a germ factory.Edited: 10:13 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Agreed sssnakes @89. I contemplated suggesting earlier that perhaps it would actually be safer for tourists to spend their time in Cuba off resort in casas particulares within the interior instead. But then realized that would only likely help insure the spread of the virus to the more remote areas of the island too. So, like Roseanne Roseannadanna... never mind!Terry"
"Also agree sssnakes_alive. I work in a busy healthcare clinic. I am going to use the same policy. Assume every surface has a virus and clean and hand wash as much as reasonably possible. I will take Lysol wipes and soap. Hand sanitizer for places I can’t wash my hands. Difficulties I see are plane and airport, bring in close proximity to strangers. We are planning to travel in a few weeks as long as nothing changes but although no reported cases in Cuba I feel that may not be a true reflection. Time will tell."
"hola. the thing with Cuba is all the hugs, cheeks to cheeks and kisses to cheeks. i once caught a trophy size cold sore from kisses to cheeks in Cuba. My first and last cold sore! knock on wood! it was about the size of a toonie. yup."

"That's always been my feeling and experience too... although I have been sick with a cold and flu on rare occasion.

Cuba’s public health authorities said that their nation does not register cases of covid-19
"Planes are cleaner then they have ever been right now as almost everyone is cleaning with wipes. Before this, no cleaning, except for garbage removal."

A lot of people say who cares it only really affects the elderly etc. The problem is you will get it and not know or feel a little sick then you visit me then I get it and give it to my infant kids or immune compromised dad with cancer. So great you recover but other people die that you passed it to.I'm going in 10 days but I'm still a little worried. I'm not stockpiling toilet paper:)
I was just thinking what you said Jason :) Its a commonsensical thing really...we all have to do our part to stop the spread. I'm right now designing a blow up bubble man suit...it's been tricky with the pockets and the sewing part :)
Curious? With Italy right now having the biggest outbreak is anyone aware if flights are still coming from there to Cuba? Leaving in 13 days ! Thank you
"There were 2 flights yesterday (one from Milan and one from Rome) landing in Cayo Largo. Not sure about other airports in Cuba.Edited: 8:07 am, March 08, 2020 "
I use this website. You can see flights daily to and from Varadero. Just not sure if you can see other dates or just today's. http://www.airportcuba.net/varadero.html
"Okay, so you get on an airplane, pull out a disinfectant wipe and wipe down the arms and the table top. Do you know what you've done? You've transferred some of everything from each surface you've touched. You've also not eliminated any virus or germ. The surface must remain wet for at least 4 minutes for most of these wipes. For most people using these wipes, it's all a placebo effect."

"Suzi, as others have pointed out, I think that you might be misinterpreting a translation. Check the original TeleSur article in Spanish, and what is communicated is that to date, Cuba has no confirmed cases of COVID–19."
"Suzi, I believe this is a misprint - I doubt they would even print such a statement . Doesn’t make sense really."
Thanks Mad - Anything is up for interpretation however I don’t believe that there is zero confirmed cases there.
@116 I agree with you. Flights coming in from all over the world (including hot zones like Italy)and tourism is a big thing in Cuba. The government reporting cases would stall the tourism trade there .JMO.
Does anyone REALLY think the Chinese are reporting accurately when they say that the cases of new infections are slowing? Terry
"Terry ,not for a minute."
Well there won't be any planes landing from northern Italy now that they quarantined the entire area.I don't think we will be able to escape it unless you lock yourself in your house. Might as well go to Cuba and enjoy ourselves.It's just being locked in a plane for 6 hours that I'm a little antsy about:) I definitely wouldn't want to be on a cruise.
"Jason A. Ya that plane business is a concern. There was a news report yesterday, forgive me because I don't remember which one, that recommended you stay 6 feet away from other passengers while at the airport. HUH and then i'm going to sit with two feet of space around me with other passengers on the plane with yucky air circulating around me."
Getting on a plane tomorrow morning for Varadero. Wish me luck.
"If you cut the bottom out of a 5 gallon clear water bottle and put it over your head , it makes a good shield for Cough Splatter and Spittle while you are on the plane . Johnny C"

As of tomorrow there will no international flights from Milan. They are under quarantine. But Rome flights will continue.
@140 you are right and I HAD a damn flu shot. First time I've gotten the flu since flu shots were free
"Less then 300 people have the virus in the America’s - that includes Canada , USA, Latin America and the Caribbean- it is very unfortunate what is happening in some countries- hopefully now with travel restrictions/ quarantines it will slow down the spread- we are leaving from St. John’s , Newfoundland in 13 days. Hoping for the very best :)"
Less than 400 - typo

Damn. I was going to agree with half of what you said Kelly but I'm too late.
"We will be in Varadero from April 19th....I spoke to a friend who works at the hotel...Las Morlas….and he informed me that as of last Wednesday all flights with passengers destined for the ""be Live"" resorts in Varadero have been cancelled. Be Live is an Italian operator. Maybe he meant all flights from Italy for Varadero has been cancelled....hope so!!For many years when we fly, I have always taken anti-bacterial wipes and once on board always wipe down the armrests, tray tables etc.Also at the hotels, I always wipe down the tv remote, door handles, etc.Yesterday, also was told that, currently, there are NO( reported) cases of covid19 in Cuba. Fingers crossed, it stays that way, also, in a way, trump did Cuba a favor by applying the embargo....because cruise ships are not allowed to visit Cuba.I am looking forward to our April trip,."
"re 146 - I suspect that there are a lot more cases in the US than the figures say - and that is over 600 now. They don't have enough testing kits. On the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan, about half those who tested positive for the virus had no symptoms."
"#143, there are flights from Milan. One to Havana today:https:/…"
Wow that’s terrible. Unless it’s going empty to bring people back? Hopefully.

Yes that is weird. Despite the lockdown they are still flying out of Milan to Cuba and all over the world. Are these planes empty? Lots of airlines have cancelled all flights but lots still flying. https:/…
Just buzzed through this thread. Obviously we have a trip here as well. From most of the reports all is well. Our biggest concern is not what happens on the trip. But rather being quarantined upon our return. Time will ell

"Kelly is the one acting like a snowflake, can't take criticism, can't take a differing opinion. Can't handle the truth. sad."
"bellagio.You had no reason to deny the libalus comments made by that sad sack of a human being .No one but no one believes what he said.Now as to me ,who cares because I do not."
Oh carry on. It is so nice that you think so much of me to still follow me.Carry on carry on.
I thought yesterday was Friday the 13th . Gee Willakers .Johnny C
Would appear the across the ponders got their knickers in a knot. lmfao!!
"hola. i know i shouldn't, but if this was happening on a street in Havana and a or a few Canadians were involved, i'd probably be stickin my nose in. winterpegers, your post #183? does it make you feel better. yah i know dumb question. yes, i know it makes you feel better. i find it? yah, i know, who the f_c_ am i. 'kelly', ???? why find these ways to produce, i guess, good chemicals in your blood? yah, i know who the f_c_ am i. both 'kelly' and winterpeggers are Canadian. kinda sad, for the word Canadian."
hola. i think the psycho that was in jail in the South Park toilet paper episode posted my reply of #184.
Given the recent advisories we tapped out. Worried to go to Cuba? Not at all. Going there without any medical or other coverages? Cannot do that. As much as we love going there we cannot do so on an unprotected crap shoot. Kind of funny given the fact that place we want to go has far less incidents than than the country we are in. As for now we are a bit depressed. We have a faint hope the the ban will be lifted before our take off time. If that occurs all is well. But hose are long odds.
"We were due to fly to Varadero to our golf resort Sat Mar 21. Knew deep down we had to cancel but the advisory from Canada was the icing on the cake. Not so much worried about being in Cuba, but more so worried if someone at the resort contracted the virus and we were on quarantine in our hotel room, and then upon return to Canada. Even my workplace advised against it but warned that any international travelers would not be able to return to work for 14 days, and self isolated.Called to change travel dates to November and on hold almost three hours ( I was multitasking when I called, missed the email address they suggested to write in if traveling over 72 hours away and didn’t want to lose my time already waiting). Turns out by the time the agent came on the line, he could only verify we could change our dates, no penalty, but he couldn’t actually do anything since Transat vacations was closed. I emailed the Covid site and my travel agent directly. They are more concerned with people flying in less than 72 hours, of course. Hopefully I will hear back prior to my Sat March 21 departure date; my boyfriend read on line that people are having a nightmare of a time hearing prior to their travel dates...Good luck everyone who is trying to change their dates and more importantly, stay safe and health to all..that is what is most important.."
"Holding out hope for mid April departure. But not holding our breath. If we have to, will look at rebooking for a fall trip.Love Cuba, the people and all.Last thing we want is to see Cubans struggling with this pandemic. They don't need it.Also the 14 day quarantine upon return I agree with but its not feasible for me"
"If when things get back to normal, hopefully sooner rather than later, fall is going to be the peak season this year."
"There's really no need to do anything about alternating your pre-booked plans until you absolutely have to. No need to panic. Things are changing so rapidly that the outcome could actually work in one's favour for holding out... especially if not already booked too. Those prices are now taking beating for departures within the next few weeks. Still, I understand how some might feel when it comes to the insurance situation. I have to check on that myself at my office come tomorrow to know where everything stands with my company and company provided insurance coverage for travel abroad. I'm sure many others will be doing the same and then making final decisions. Terry"
"For those of us who are choosing to go to Cuba, it seems like there’s some concerns respecting whether Cuba will close its borders. Personally, I believe Canada will always bring back their citizens. But that’s only feasible when the departing country is cooperating. If Cuba decides to close its borders and you’re in Cuba, would you think they would give advance notice for a few days? I imagine they’d mention it so to give an opportunity for tourists to leave... but I’m unsure how the other countries (Poland, Italy, etc.) treated closing their borders. Was it cold turkey or was it with advance notice?"
"Hyru, I think the most important aspect is that provisions will most certainly be made (perhaps not to the satisfaction of all) to bring back anybody from anywhere to their country of origin. In the case of Cuba, they have a good working relationship with the Canadian government and Canadian air carriers, so that would naturally extend to accommodating the evacuation of remaining tourists before closing their border completely to new incoming flights of more tourists.Terry"
"hola. if someone goes for a'holiday' to Cuba today(i'm typing this without even knowing todays news) and you can't make it back home because of the circumstances, i won't feel sorry for you and many others shouldn't also. you or yous choose the path to walk on. you maybe took a left when maybe you should of took a right. ps - going there because of family, i'll help you make a raft to get there. but you might need a raft to get back."
@#191.......you are still planning on going to Cuba?
"Maple, my flight is on the 23rd and I’m monitoring things as they go along. It’ll probably be a last minute decision. I have friends and family there that I’ve been meaning to see for awhile now. Personally for me, the risk of catching it (at the airport vs being in the GTA) doesn’t seem that great. I’d much rather avoid the sheep at Costco... Cuba has few reported cases. I’m self employed and work from home so a self quarantine is not an issue. Those I’ve talked to in Havana at this time indicate all is normal over there. I’m on the fence about things but my concern is whether the borders of Cuba can be completely shut and I’d be stuck there until further notice. I’d like to think they’ll give advance notice but this is Cuba after all..."
"I agree with CCO on this. Your airline / tour operator will send a plane to repatriate you. That’s not a problem. The challenge is that you might only have a day or two of your vacation before being notified that there is a flight heading to Cuba to pick you up. That would be a bummer, no question, and it would be doubtful if you would get any reimbursement for lost vacation days.For anyone not travelling on a package deal, make sure that your air carrier / tour operator has contact info for you wherever you will be in Cuba in case they have to contact you to tell you to get to the airport."
"192 — thank you Terry, I’d like to think the same."
hola. reply #195 'Havana at this time indicate all is normal over there.' i find that hard to believe. normal over there at this time?
"gerro — Yes, Normal.Thanks."
"""For anyone not travelling on a package deal, make sure that your air carrier / tour operator has contact info for you wherever you will be in Cuba in case they have to contact you to tell you to get to the airport.""Mad @196, good point. That would affect me for sure, and to tell you the truth, I'm usually off the grid when there so I'll definitely have to provide some form of contact info, just in case if still going. Thanks for pointing that out.Terry"
good for you have a great time
"It might be a safe feeling being on a beach, but what about the airports, the planes, the buses, to get there? Not to mention if someone in the resort is infected and then everyone eats from the buffet or whatever. Anyways Canada has specifically said that no Canadians should travel overseas and those who are overseas should comeback asap, but I guess people still want to travel... My travel insurance from work even sent me an email saying that whoever travels after march 12 won't be covered and that they are travelling at their own risk because the Canadian government has already said not to travel. Good luck, but this is only getting worse all over the world and I doubt that in Cuba they are testing hundreds of people per day, so the stats probably are wrong. Also if you get there, by the time your vacation is over there might be no flights back."
As much as everyone would love to have a vacation it is obvious this boat has set sail and is in a different port. We would love to be going there. It is our truly happy place. At some point logic has to step in. Health insurance is a no go. Getting back is a challenge. This is an island we love. Be responsible. Stay home. This to will pass and future memories can be built later. Bummed out about about the current state of affairs? Yes. This place that is in our heart will still be here after all of this is done.
"I'm still going April 18th... if still allowed, and if there are still flights leaving YYZ for HOG at that time. Terry"
"In NB, all the Buffet restaurants are closed."
The D.R.Republic is closing borders 6am tomorrow. No incoming flights. Cuba should be shortly.
