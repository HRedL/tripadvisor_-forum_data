"I'm very glad you had a good week, john, and don't seem to have seen any signs that NCL has gone downhill since we last cruised with them just over 2 years ago now.I still don't much like Epic, but I'm pleased to see that you don't think standards are slipping. My first ever cruise was solo, but now that I've sailed so many times with my wife, I don't think I would enjoy a cruise on my own."
"Hi John:Wondering what the dress code for Men was on the Epic. We are on it February 2020.I understand some a la cartes require long pants - I believe Le Bistro was one of them.Can you tell me if the MDRs require the same? We were on the Escape January 2019 and long pants were required for Le Bistro, and I believe 1 other a la carte only - not the MDRS.I've called NCL and be given conflicting information from 2 different agents.Thanks!Edited: 2:23 pm, January 09, 2020 "
