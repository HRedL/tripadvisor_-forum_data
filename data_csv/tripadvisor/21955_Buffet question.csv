We will be in Vegas for spring break next week. One of our favorite things to do is hit the buffets. Are they taking any extra precautions? Also what about pools and hot tubs?
Extra precautions for what?
"The coronavirus, no doubt."
Probably not too much different then what they would do in the flu season. I would'nt worry too much about it. Its the news media and people that are building this up to be the end of the world. Actual facts suggest otherwise.

You might call the hotel to inquire.
"""Its the news media and people that are building this up to be the end of the world. Actual facts suggest otherwise""Exactly. Although both real and serious, in the end this will be the largest and most expensive media/political heap in world history.Edited: 3:04 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Perhaps the best precaution is to avoid eating at a communal trough in the current circumstances?
"Lol, Jamborino nailed it. I’m struggling to figure out what steps they could take to minimize the risk of catching a virus at a buffet. Other than shutting it down. Pools and hot tubs? Shut ‘em down! Along with theaters. Bars. Restaurants. Casinos. Health clubs. Spas. Airports. Just keep the grocery stores open. Only one person allowed in at a time. And they have to use the self checkout."
">>>I’m struggling to figure out what steps they could take to minimize the risk of catching a virus at a buffet.<<<Have employees dish/serve all the food. Every regular here must have atrocious stories about things they've seen people do at a buffet (tasting dishes/sauces with a finger to see what it is; using their hands to pick up food [and worse, put the food back] and more)."
Are they going to let me wipe off the dice with my disinfectant wipes before I have to hold them in my hand before I shoot them ?
"The Parasite Garden Buffet at the Flamingo is making sure that most of their food is inedible in an attempt to help discourage the spreading of the coronavirus. Wait, are you asking if they are doing anything different? Never mind. You can disregard my statement above as something new. This has been their practice for several years. Sorry that I misunderstood your question."
"people will stick their fingers in their mouths or lick their fingers, and then then use those same fingers to pick up the tongs at buffet stations. not sure what you expect the people running the buffet to do . hiring a bunch of extra people to serve each type of food at each station is pretty unrealistic, lol.Edited: 9:11 pm, March 08, 2020 "
""" hiring a bunch of extra people to serve each type of food at each station is pretty unrealistic, lol.""On cruise ships when there is a norovirus outbreak, that's what they do; have the servers serve the buffet food, the passengers don't touch the serving utensils."
i have no experience with vegas or cruise buffets other than what i've seen on videos. how many extra employees would it take for that to happen at wicked spoon or bacchanal?
"""how many extra employees would it take for that to happen at wicked spoon or bacchanal?""A lot; they would probably shrink the serving area if they kept it open at all.Not sure what their protocol would be; we're on fairly new ground here."
Not sure if you can expect that servers at other restaurants would be any different from those at the buffet. You assume that servers at full service restaurants won’t taste your food or touch their face before touching your food or your plates and utensils.
I was in Las Vegas last Sunday. There were multiple hand sanitizer stations that appeared almost overnight everywhere (they had not been there five days earlier when we left for Palm Springs) and many staff were wearing gloves. Other than that I can’t say.For the naysayers - the contagion rate in Europe is increasing quite rapidly. It would probably do no harm to be cautious especially if one is a frequent travelled/in a high density area.

"MGM resorts is temporarily shutting down all buffets at it's LV properties beginning on March 15th. https:/…Edited: 9:42 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Espn, what do you suppose the guy in the kitchen where you are dining is doing picking his nose and sneezing it in your stir fry, its ok he probably washed his hands a couple of days ago... lol"
"MGM, aria, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, the mirage, and Excalibur are actually shutting down their buffets Temporarily"
I heard that they are closing the buffets at the MLife hotels on Sunday until further notice... That is the only one I have heard of so far closing.
Just like airlines. When one does it normally others will follow. i would expect to hear about more closings in the next few days for buffets.
Drink some more kool aid !!
"They will keep the Parasite Garden Buffet open, because not even the Coronavirus would visit there."
"Yes, I am a resident here. all MGM casino buffets are closed, along with that property pools, sport events. Just check your resort you are staying at, Im sure some are still open like red rock casino, caesars hasn't closed their buffet yet or the M, both which are suppose to be fabulous. Hope that helps."
"""Drink some more kool aid !!""How many copses are you willing to take responsibility for?"
