"Hello,When I try to book online, even if I can get a refundable hotel up to date of arrival, the airlines only offer refunds for 24 hours after booking. What's happens if something unforeseen comes up a few days prior to departure? Thousands of dollars are lost. Does anyone know of reasonable refund policies for hotels and airlines booked together? Thank you in advance!"
"Travel insurance. Airlines typically offer something, but I book my own policy. I use Travel Insured because they are a partner of my bank. I had to use it only once, but I was able to get most of what I had prepaid back. All policies are different, and there are some websites that offer a comparison across several companies."
"Surely you have travel insurance? In case of emergencies or anything out of your control, you can make a claim. If you haven't got insurance, get some now!"
"Presumably you are booking a air + hotel package to save costs then stand alone prices, but a non refundable hotel rate is always cheaper than a refundable rate so when you are calculating your air+hoel package savings, make sure you are comparing the right rates. Is it really that expensive to book a refundable hotel and air ticket separately? Just asking out of curiosity as NYC usually has the most competitive air fares for Europe."
"Thank you for your quick response. Even if I do book separately, air fare is still only refundable for 24 hours. The most recent separate quote I received for air fare is $1,324 rt. for 2 people. The hotel separately would be $3,405, totaling $4,729, which is approx. $800 above what a bundled hotel/flight would cost. I'm okay doing separate if I could find an airline that offered a fair refund period. This is absolutely daunting."
"I always book my hotels myself so cannot speak to that, but you will not find any airline giving you a good refund policy beyond 24 hours--they get more and more punitive. The only way to protect yourself is with a travel insurance policy. It may add a couple hundred to your travel costs, but for peace of mind, that is what I do."
"Maybe it’s because I’m in the UK - not the U.S..But I’ve never heard of “refundable” air fares. If, due to ill health or whatever one is unable to make the flight - then as others have said, you claim on your travel insurance.Imagine the chaos if air fares were refundable like hotel rooms are - folks would be multi-booking and cancelling willy nilly - airlines could not operate like that (I often wonder how the heck hotels cope to be honest..)"
"We buy an annual travel insurance policy for about $U.S.500. We haven't had to file a claim so far -- but we are about to. In the past, we have generally bought travel insurance through whatever airlines we're flying -- usually United for long-haul flights. On one occasion, we had to make a claim, and it went through with no problems at all, covering the cost of the airlines, hotels, etc."
"If you want a refundable air ticket you generally buy a full fare ticket. Still, nonrefundable tix can often be rebooked for another date vwithin 12 months of date of original booking upon payment of a fee, maybe around $200."
"Also, travel insurance will cover you only if you cancel for a reason covered by policy. So read policy.Also, note fact that in US you get full refund if cancel within 24 hours has nothing to do with airlines. Was established by federal law I believe -- so if you want longer period ask your reps in Congress to enact new law."
"Several years ago I became ill the night before a flight on American. We did not have travel insurance. American charged us $100. per ticket for cancelling the flight and the rest went on a credit fo the airline. I didn't think that was too bad. SInce then we always buy flight insurance when we purchase our tickets. For our trip to Italy (American Air) coming up in September we purchased the insurance when we booked the tickets. The insurance was just over $700. HOWEVER read the fine print. Being concerned about the Coronovirus I read the policy carefully. The policy will not pay if cancelled due to an epidemic. The W.H.O. has now listed the virus as an epidemic. We are debating buying a policy that will let us cancel for any reason. This will cover the air, hotels ( that we have prepaid) and tours and tickets (that we have prepaid). These policies start at $2,500. We haven't made our decision yet. Our airfare alone was over $9,000. for two business class tickets. Since you haven't booked yet, find out what your airline policy is if you cancel at the last minute. If it's only $100. per ticket with the balance going on an airline credit, then I wouldn't take any insurance. For your hotels, Booking.com shows prices for prepaid and prices if you cancel. The prices if you cancel are higher, but that might be the way to go.Good luck with whatever you decide to do."
"You can get a cancel for any reason policy for much less than 2500. I use Travel Insured, and it was about 300 to cover about 3000 worth of airfare--I can get 75% back. I had to use it once (US govt shutdown) and the process was simple."
"I travel frequently for work and fun. I have never paid for a refundable flight ticket or purchased trip insurance. I often book refundable hotel rates, even if it costs a little bit more. For flights, sure, you'll be out the $200 change fee and then the rest will go to credit with the airline...but I don't find I cancel trips often enough that the insurance/refundable rates are worth it overall. My company has made the same determination and we are not permitted to buy refundable airfare or purchase insurance for work travel (they'll eat the costs if necessary, and still come out better that way)."
"So Becky, if you fall ill while on holiday or have an accident requiring hospitalisation your company just pays all your medical bills, repatriation, air ambulance etc?Insurance does have some uses I believe.Of course it is worth shopping around as for any purchase. I find an annual policy is worth it if you are going to have at least 2 holidays."
"The bundled deals always seem to be the most basic-no refund price. You can either purchase your own cancellation and medical insurance ( easy to do online) or bite the bullet and purchase the next level up of air ticket. Very often, you can pay a penalty and the rest is provided as a travel credit for a year. Many credit cards have medical and interruption, but cancellation insurance seems to be included less often. My recent experiences with the bundled deals through third parties is ""meh"". In the end, maybe a few dollars, but I have gone back to a good old fashioned travel agent and or booking the flights and hotels directly. Travel is expensive, certainly no free lunch, but experiences can't be beat in my books. Good luck sorting through it all and enjoy the planning."
"When making airline bookings online, you should examine the terms and conditions. These may vary with different price.When you have a booking, you can, if you booked with the airline, go to Manage My Booking and cancel. We have flights from Sydney to Italy Sept-Nov ... I just checked and yes we can get refund of about AUD1950 of 2600 if we cancel. (for lowest price economy)As regards your accommodation costs. Unless you are staying a long time you are looking at a hotel way above my pay scale; a price where loss of the money should not worry!Go to booking.com and in the left column, under Reservation Policy tick free cancellation. And other preferences. Don't just tick five star, not so relevant in Italy, unless you want to be bumped by the security guy shepherding some mediocre heart throb.Edited: 6:51 pm, February 27, 2020 "
Insurance - both medical and trip cancellation/interruption.
You are correct that there are less costly options. I should have mentioned that we are retired and medicare ( which is not valid outside the U.S.) is our primary health insurance. The cost of my policy includes excellent medical-both for in Italy and transport home if need be.
"#13 - I was thinking in terms of flight/hotel/etc. insurance, which is often sold by the airlines/travel company etc and what I considered the focus of the post. Those specifically I don't see it worth it in the long run."
"It's easy to get a refundable air ticket. You just pay full fare.When discounted, or supersaver, fares came into being 40 or so years ago (before then everything was full fare) they came with restrictions. Originally they were all nonchangeable and nonrefundable. Over time the restrictions were eased (except for most of the new basic econ fares) so that now you can often change them for a fee, though they are still generally nonrefundable.And never ever buy trip insurance (thru which you MIGHT recover ticket cost) thru an airline, tour operator, cruise line, ticket broker, travel agent, etc. You generally pay more and get less coverage thru them.Edited: 3:19 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Agree with QQ2 you will never get a good price on refundable Intl airfare.You can get trip insurance but there are different types, so let you cancel for any reason but those are rare and usually costly. The other type are inexpensive and common but won't let you cancel cause you don't feel like going or you are afraid of getting sick. Refundable hotel bookings are easy to find."
We bought non-refundable airline tickets for May this year. We're most likely going to cancel the entire trip and wait to book again. The virus is supposed to get worse before getting better so who knows how long that will be. The airline will allow us to get refunded on the taxes only yet that is still something.
"I wouldn't cancel the airline tickets until you are much closer to the date of travel. If the virus does get worse, maybe the airline will change it's policy. If they are only willing to refund the taxes, you have nothing to lose by waiting. Two years ago we had to cancel one the day before our flight and we were able to cancel with $100. per ticket fee and the remainder went on a credit for the airline that was good for one year."
"Trip insurance. Search and compare prices, and also read reviews of the company - they are not all created equal. You can get a ""cancel for any reason"" rider on the policy which will increase the price but maybe worth it for peace of mind. Also...government imposed travel restrictions tend to be a covered event, in case your concerns are related to corona virus."
"Read any policy carefully. I added trip insurance thru the airline (American) when I purchased our tickets for Italy. Bad move. When I read the policy, it states that it is not in effect in the event of an epidemic. The Wold Health Org. has listed the Coronovirus as an epidemic. Our trip isn't until September so we shall see what happens. We have two business class that came to over $9,000. I only bought the insurance because of the virus. You don't see the policy until after you purchase it. I'm going to see if I can cancel the policy."
"Yes, all the travel insurance policies I have purchased do not cover epidemics, even the “cancel for any reason” options. I have trips booked for a Paris riverboat cruise to Normandy in April, Florence and two other nearby areas in July, and Spain in October. I will not cancel any of these myself but will wait to see if my cruise or flights are canceled and if so probably will get a refund. My biggest expense for all three trips is nonrefundable business class air as well. Hotels and villa Or apartment rentals can be canceled 24 hours before checkin so ok. I will just play it day by day..."
