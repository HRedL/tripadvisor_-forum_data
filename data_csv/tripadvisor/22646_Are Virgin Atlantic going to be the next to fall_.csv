"Who knows but Virgin have been vocal in their case for a government bailout and the sky story is little more than parties with a vested interest in Virgin Atlantic lending their support to the demand - hardly an unbiased stance.""One industry source said the letters had been written at the instigation of the British airline."""
"If they do Fail, there will be hardly any transatlantic flights,"
#2 There will be fewer but 'hardly any'?
"Any loan should be at a stake in the airline until the loan has been repaid in full, at a good rate of interest. How about the US government put their hands in their pockets?"
There will certainly be some consolidation on the TATL routes. It was a very crowded market pre-coronavirus and that level of competition will not be sustainable going forward.
"There will still be plenty of transatlantic carriers when operations begin. However I would guess that passenger numbers will be a lot less so I’m sure that Virgin may not be missed. There may be less competition but it’s going to be about who has been able to whether the virus.Will we need, in terms of capacity, 2 UK airlines? If BA has more resilience and reserves is that the airline to save, they have a bigger network, Virgin is much smaller. It’s a difficult dilemma. I don’t want our government throwing away money to companies that may still fail. It appears that Virgin were tottering on the edge as we are not very far into this crisis and they need money.These days what is a UK company with globalisation the boundaries are blurred. Virgin owned by Delta (US) and Branson (?). BA part of IAG are they Spanish? Can anyone explain?"
"You've called it right Smudge - I was ranting about this a week or 2 back.Virgin are 49% Delta and Branson announce the sale of 30% to Air France last year, but Leyland enlightened me that AF pulled out (lucky escape) so Branson still has the rest. IAG are IMO Spanish, Iberia, Veuling, Level (Spain, long haul, & short haul) Aer Lingus and BA - but they've deliberately set up a ghost company structure, in Spain, that pedals the sales revenue, which during Brexit had a spotlight on it - dubious circumnavigation at best.So why oh why would we throw UK taxpayers cash at multinational conglomerates controlled from overseas? NOT LIKELY is my view, throw them to the dogs and buy back the remnants from the administrators, and run them both from scratch. It's an excellent opportunity on 2 counts - it sits with Brexit perfectly, and it fits the enforced downsizing required due to the virus"
"The problem for Virgin is that they're a privately held company with essentially just two owners; Branson (51%)** and Delta (49%). Delta is in self-preservation mode itself and is unlikely to offer hundreds of millions to keep an unprofitable joint venture afloat (even before covid-19). That leaves Branson to come up with everything or find another partner to take on the risk which is very slim.** - JBB, it was Branson that pulled out of the sale of 30% to AF/KL. He was revitalized by the growth potential for VS with Runway 3 (oops).IAG has a massive stockpile of cash, I suspect due to Brexit and its complex ownership structure (as a rough guess 40-45% UK, 30-35% EU, 20% Qatar and 0-10% whoever). They need to have Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus in a majority (50% +1) EU owned company in order to fly within EU Open Skies. And that would/will quite possibly involve splitting IAG into two. That would cause a massive disruption, so stockpiling cash was a wise move. It may still work if IAG survives covid intact while several European competitors go bust.Edited: 2:00 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"Thanks USBT - so your breakdown sent me delving, as one does. I found this on the IAG site newsroomhttps:/…limit-on-non-eu-shareholdingAnd if I read it correctly, as at 17th Jan, non EU ownership = 39.5% and the UK is clearly stated later in the doc as included in the EU % (60.5%) . . . . I'll throw a dart at around 25/30% BA / UK or possibly less."
"""If they do Fail, there will be hardly any transatlantic flights,""In 2013 there are between 2,000 and 3,000 flights across the Atlantic in a day.I doubt that VA going out of business would result in ""hardly any"" flights. :-)Source: https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014…"
"Wow USBT, thanks for that, I think I may understand a little more. If IAG have large reserves does this not show its a more robust group than Virgin? Is this the one to survive and save?The economics, globalisation, big business is beyond me."
"It seems to me that Branson, supposedly worth 5+ Billion USD but living in the Caribbean & paying no income tax in the UK, likes to ask the UK taxpayer to bail his companies out as, when you throw in Flybe, this is twice within a few weeks that he has asked."
"""Wow USBT, thanks for that, I think I may understand a little more. If IAG have large reserves does this not show its a more robust group than Virgin?""========================Absolutely, they are and have always been way more robust. Just with the caveat that their saving massive cash reserves were with Brexit in mind, and so if aviation trade talks don't go well they may be in trouble then. Delta and RyanAir are more profitable than IAG but they spent much more of their profits on the likes of dividends and stock buy backs.Btw, just to clarify what I wrote earlier.""Delta is in self-preservation mode itself and is unlikely to offer hundreds of millions to keep an unprofitable joint venture afloat (even before covid-19).""That should probably have said Delta being ""unlikely to offer hundreds of millions to keep an unprofitable (even before covid-19) joint venture afloat.""VS wasn't hugely unprofitable before this year, and without the current crisis DL was likely to keep things going because of the benefits of pulling VS pax onto DL domestic flights. But when they'll need every dollar they can to get through this crisis themselves they're unlikely to prop up VS. Hence (sadly) I fear VS may be heading to big trouble. Others at risk must include Norwegian (despite the bailout), SAS, LOT and possibly IcelandAir. Tui (the travel company) got a bailout from the German government, as they're German.And here are plenty of other airlines flying TATL; BA, plus UA/DL,/AA to the US, and AC/WS to Canada.Edited: 5:51 pm, April 01, 2020 "

"<< How about the US government put their hands in their pockets? >>Sorry, but I don't see this happening. The government, which translates into the taxpayers, are already trying to bolster US airlines. I can't see them doing so for a company still being 51% foreign-owned or I hope they won't. In addition to owning 49% of VS, DL also owns 20% of Latam, who I don' think was on the best financial ground before this either. The Chilean government isn't in favor of a bailout and I doubt DL will have enough money to help bailout 2 foreign airlines, even though they hold a stake in both."
"#12 and lets not forget that in the past Branson has been a vocal critic of government supportthis from Feb 2010The US government's decision to support a plan allowing American Airlines (AA) and British Airways (BA) to join forces is ""a kick in the teeth"" for consumers, Virgin Atlantic boss Sir Richard Branson has said.or this from a decade ago about government support for BAHe (Branson)said the idea of an intervention by Ministers was a 'bad idea' and that 'loss-making and inefficient airlines should be allowed to go the wall,' adding: 'The Government should not intervene to stop companies going bust.I have every sympathy for the Virgin staff but sorry none whatsoever for Branson who at best is a hypocrite"
"<< Sorry, but I don't see this happening. The government, which translates into the taxpayers, are already trying to bolster US airlines. I can't see them doing so for a company still being 51% foreign-owned or I hope they won't >>The feeling is mutual. I hope the UK government won't bolster an airline that is 49% foreign owned, especially as it wasn't profitable before this pandemic. They've not as yet given aid to any other airlines, which are more worthy of help than VS."
"Richard Branson is injecting a $250 million investment into the Virgin Group, although not sure what the breakdown of this investment is and how much will go towards the airline.https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/3645…"
