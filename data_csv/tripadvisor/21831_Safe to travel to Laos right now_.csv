"Hi,I haven't read anything about Laos being affected by CoronoVirus yet. But given its proximity to China, just a bit anxious. Anyone in Laos currently who can tell what the situation on ground is? Is travelling there okay? Screening happening at the airports? Any information would be helpful.Thank you!"
"Screening at the airports, but it is as safe as anywhere in Asia here."
"The issue isn't the situation right now, it's about what'll happen in a week, or a month or two. (You haven't said when you're travelling.) The situation could possibly be much worse by then, and the disease could be everywhere. Or nowhere.It wouldn't surprise me if a small, insular country like Laos deals with it by shutting the airports and borders. How flexible is your schedule?"
Flying there this week. Hoping things are under control.Thanks!
Thanks
"""It wouldn't surprise me if a small, insular country like Laos deals with it by shutting the airports and borders.""It would surprise me, but no doubt a Canadian has a better insight into these things than a long time resident."
Some countries are shutting their borders and cancelling their flights from China. No one knows how this will develop. No restrictions as far I know for Chinese visiting Laos or Thailand. There are quite a few Chinese hereas Chinese New Year.
"The issue is that Laos has no REPORTED cases as of this morning. There still may be virus cases present, just not reported. No news since 05-Feb on this topic in the Laotian news feeds. If anyone has a more recent update I would appreciate it."
laos already blocked the border for Chinese citizens or anyone who is traveling from China.visit the laos e-visa website there is a warning for Chinese citizens and for other foreigners who is traveling from China they will be refused entry into the country.so I think it's safe to travel.
"Michael, I agree. There was an article in last weeks NY Times saying how some of these (poorer) bordering countries are beholden to China for trade and infrastructure and are not willing to report any cases of the virus. Myanmar, Bangladesh and Laos all have no cases, yet share a border and many itinerant workers with the China. I should say no REPORTED cases. I will be there in less than 10 days."
"Thanks. Still does not mention Laos, but the point is the same. There is a difference between cases and reported cases."
How was Laos? Did you encounter any issues related to coronovirus? I have a flight there in mid March and debating canceling. Thanks
It is still safe here. No reported cases.
"Hi all.I did make the trip in Feb first week albeit with a lot of caution. Wore masks, ate vegetarian food etc. Things seemed okay then and we had a good time. There was absolutely no screening at luang prabang airport then. Perhaps, (hopefully) they've started now."
"No screening at LP airport laat Thursday. Quite a few locals wearing masks, not so many tourists. I think there is some degree of scepticism as regards the official version, which i tend to share. Having said thst, it's probably as safe as anywhere else."
""" I think there is some degree of scepticism as regards the official version, which i tend to share.""Why do you share that? Are you privy to information to which the rest of us are not privy?"
Also what precisely can you screen against. The 2 week incubation period has you displaying no symptoms and you are a risk.
Obviously I agree about that.It seems the WHO agrees with me about the other bit.
"Screening (temperature check) at airports is little use, it's more political to show the public that they are doing something. The UK does not bother at airports. Even if they did a swab test it would not do much and results can take days to come back. Countries in this area have low reported cases. Most of the cases are in cold climates, China, S. Korea, Italy and Iran. Yes I understand the issues when returning home, you could be in quarantine for 14 days etc. This is spreading from Europe now, it is already in the USA and that will grow."
"""It seems the WHO agrees with me about the other bit.""Again I find that interesting as we get updates from the WHO every 2 days, so I ask what source do you have that we do not?"
