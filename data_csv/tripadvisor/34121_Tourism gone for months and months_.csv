"I just finished reading the Premier's remarks made today (Saturday) regarding the likely closing of the borders until a. a vaccine is available, or b. visitors can be subject to on the spot testing. According to him the time line before visitors will be allowed will be a long time. He goes on to say that locals in the tourism industry should be looking to ""repurpose"" their business where it doesn't rely on tourists. This could easily be the sounding of the death knell for Cayman Island tourism. He's urging foreign workers to leave. While this would ease the current burden on social services, it also means that it will take a long time to get those people back if they come back at all. Is his thinking that Caymanians will then move into those jobs? It would be nice to think so but history will say that the Caymanians are not the ones in most of the tourism jobs. I feel awful for the island and our caymanian friends as I do for all the areas affected by this virus. However long it lasts it will take time for economies to get back up and running. However these statements by the Premier almost sound like he believes a long long shutdown is what is best for the island. I'm not sure I agree with that. I would encourage you to read the article in full on the Compass web site. (it is titled Dart helps launch....)"
"If that is the truth. It makes little or no sense. The country cannot survive on banking alone. Might as well burn everything down. Waiting for a vaccine is not tenable. On the spot testing is not feasible. Even if you could do it expeditiously what if someone tests positive, what do you do? Quarantine the entire plane?No one will travel to Cayman ever.B"
Just to be clear. Cayman Islands as of today has 45 confirmed cases and 1 death. I believe the death was the person from the cruise ship.B.
"53 cases with 6 not linked to travel or previous cases....all beaches to be totally closed down due to people congregating. This was another Compass article today. It also suggested Cayman could very well be closed to tourism until next year and was urging business to revamp from tourism to other purposes. Cannot imagine how hotels and condo properties, snorkel and dive ops could do this. It is almost like a last man out turn off the lights statement. Like any leader of any country, the health and safety of its people must be the top priority. In this case wonder how long those who have come to greatly depend upon the tourism sector will go along with it being the sole priority. A friend recently said...there is a difference between life and a life worth living. Not easy for me to wrap my brain around that viewpoint.Edited: 9:39 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"You are spot on about testing if upon arrival. Even if tested prior to departure from wherever, as of now, there is no guarantee a passenger could develop symptoms en route. If upon arrival all passengers would be put under quarantine. Nope, I would not take the chance of that happening for a vacation!"
"I don't get it. Cayman is going to self destruct if this is the case. This is a terrible situation and you need to protect your people but they also need protection financially and destroying your economy is not the way to do it. Could you imagine if NYC one of the worst places for Covid 19 said we're closed until next year? B.Edited: 9:35 am, April 12, 2020 "
"Well, if Cayman becomes intensely restrictive to visitors in the interest of not posing any risk of infection due to Covid-19 they will be protecting their residents but destroying their tourism industry. Not to diminish the potential serious health consequences of this virus, but at some point everybody needs to find balance between risk and being locked up by the government over the fear that you might get sick. The rise in domestic abuse in the area where I live is quite alarming and parents of a child on the autism spectrum say she now fears going outside to even their own backyard as well as being less than 6’ inside from her parents and sibling. A lovely child who was happy and thriving until about the 2 week point of their stay at home order. Damage that goes beyond economics.Tens of thousands of deaths from it in the USA.....how many millions of living victims are we willing to accept?"
"<< “ or b. visitors can be subject to on the spot testing.” >>In a thread on the TCI forum I did this math.The “rapid” test from Abbott Diagnostics takes 5min for a positive result and 15min for a negative result. The machine can only do one test at a time. Assuming everyone tests negative — hopefully — that would mean testI got every person on a plane with 200 passengers would take 3,000 minutes.Yup. Even with a “rapid test” it would take FIFTY HOURS to screen and deplane just one flight. Two machines per flight would bring that down to 25 hrs. Four machines... 12.5hrs. Eight machines... just over six hours. 16 machines PER FLIGHT would still take more than three hours to deplane a single flight.No matter how motivated, the logistical reality simply precludes this approach.Edited: 1:09 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"Interesting thread. As someone who lives in Cayman, had a business in the tourism industry and have several people whom I am very close to who may have to leave (including a child who has called this full time home for 10 years), we understand what they are doing and why. We spend part of everyday and all day Sunday on lock down. There are no businesses except grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies, restaurant take out and banks open. We wouldn’t be doing this if we did not believe we had a future. If it means keeping people out from a country or countries that Covid has been running rampant so be it. Survived after having to pretty much rebuild after Ivan even though building supplies paid for were confiscated in Florida. Will do it again as there is no choice."
"I work for a company that makes the PCR based kit. We can do 94 tests in 3.25 hours. On one set of machines. The machines are very expensive and require technical expertise. So still will never work.If Cayman wants to commit Economic suicide that is there choice. Should be some good bargains down the road on condos when everyone defaults with no tourists on the island. I would hate to be a dive shop.  Glass half full.... at least the Turtle Farm will go out of business. B.Edited: 2:29 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"Retrip I realize living on the island gives you a different prospective than me. You liken this to rebuilding after Ivan. However as I see it Ivan involved primarily physical rebuilding(not to discount the mental and emotioal toll) . We were back at the Beach Suites 6 months after Ivan. While there were plenty of blue tarps on roofs, the underlying tourism industry was up and going pretty strong and tourists were encouraged to return.. In this virus reaction by the Government, they are intentionally dismantling the tourism business in the islands by saying tourists(and investors) aren't welcome until their unreasonable or impossible requirements are met and locals involved in tourism should start repurposing their business. Lockdowns,and curfews are completely necessary at the point in time. But they appear to be to adopting the draconian action of intentionally shutting people out of the island far into the future. If they ever get back to wanting tourists to come they will have a lot of damage to overcome that will require more than lumber, shingles and nails."
"The same measures, including curfews for some States (NJ where we have immediate family), are in force here with the addition of wearing masks for workers at permitted stores (grocery, pharmacy) required and in some States even for all customers. We are going into week 5, have the Abbott rapid test, increasing positive results come in as more people can be tested. The thing is, without symptoms the test is useless. Plus those with symptoms whose test result is negative (the overwhelming majority) cannot be guaranteed they will not eventually contract the virus. It will only be after a reliable vacinne is developed, goes thru extensive trials that prove it is effective, and then administered to the entire population that Cayman or anywhere else can believe they are quite safely be able to say this germ is not a problem. So maybe in another 12-18 months for those demanding some sort of guarantee.And yes, we too vacationed there 6 months after Ivan. Not many of us since few places were open. Lots of blue tarps everywhere. Comparing Ivan rebuilding to Cayman tourism being totally dismantled is apples to oranges.Edited: 3:07 pm, April 12, 2020 "
A test is actually VERY important without symptoms as one can be asymptomatic and still have the virus. This is one way how moving forward future outbreaks will be controlled. B.
"Midwest mom in some respects there were similar problems directly related to tourism. Many of those who worked in the industry had to get back here, they had to find new accommodations, renew permits, pensions, health, etc. Some lost everything they owned including pets, momentous, etc. They returned to a shamble. Those who stayed tell tales of being unable to contact family members for days. Shops, restaurants and Watersports had to get new equipment which at least this time will not be the case. I am curious if people are following other small island nations? We see Caribbean News as well as Caymanian and some countries that only have tourism are doing the same. The gov here has frozen work permits so those people can come back. There is no way that many directly in tourism can repurpose. I think much of those comments are to try to get employees working despite the lack of tourists. They don’t get unemployment benefits. We didn’t at all take away from it that they don’t want tourists when the time is right. My business is dead. I know many dive ops that are in a similar situation. The same thing happened after Ivan. Maybe our lives will never be the same, and maybe I too will be forced to leave, but like others are willing to at least try to have a good outcome. All any of us can do is try. I think our people are looking at small water bound nations such as New Zealand as a model rather than countries spread over huge land masses. We just don’t compare. Hopefully most of our Govs get it right for their specific countries.Edited: 3:58 pm, April 12, 2020 "

l0vethebeach87I remember how difficult the shingex vaccine was to get...wonder if that will be the case when they develop a vaccine for covid

"I had the old shingles vacinne and when the new, more effective 2 shot one came out it took me until this past summer to be able to get it. Even when a vacinne is available for Covid-19 who knows if it will be highly effective or more like the flu vacinne which is at about 60%. Who knows if this virus behaves more stable or if it changes from year to year like influenza? Cayman wanting a guarantee will mean never reopening to vacationers."
This virus Sars-COV2 has so far been pretty stable which is a great sign for vaccines.B.
"Lovecayman, you’re right. I made reference to that earlier in this chain. The flu vaccine, preventing another contagious respiratory disease is far from guaranteed to prevent the flu. No vaccine will ever be and the strains, like you said, may mutate from season to season. As I also said, if Cayman is looking for some sort of guarantee that people visiting aren’t positive for Covid, they may never open for tourism again. That will be absolutely impossible. Im glad you were able to finally get Shingrix. It’s a great vaccine and certainly wasn’t easy to find."
"Boo, yes, so far that is encouraging that it doesn’t appear to mutate rapidly at this point. Let’s pray it stays that way. One of my good friends just tested positive for covid 19. He’s 42 and at this point doesn’t require hospitalization but nonetheless very scary."
Let us not forget you cannot at least in the US force people to get vaccinated. There is unfortunately a large population of anti-vaxxers. That is why measles is back.B.
"I'd be ""bummed"" if I was out of work, had meager savings, a mortgage and a family to feed. Losing or delaying a vacation that many can not afford anyway would not be a true ""bummer"" for me."

"Yes you can have had this virus with no symptoms and if the test indicates that, great. You could also have no or some symptoms, have the test and be negative but that does not mean you cannot contract this virus going forward. Here, the rapid test is available for all health care workers, all those who work at places like grocery stores or other essential jobs even with no symptoms, but not enough testing capacity for everybody who simply wants a test. Our very excellent, accomplished head of the State Department Of Health explained why testing everyone was neither needed no wise at this point for the reason given in my second sentence of this post. If positive yet asymptomatic, mandatory 14 day isolation for that person as well as 14 day quarantine for anyone they had been in contact with. Nobody is happy with the ramifications of this crisis! It is perfectly okay to “bummed” over a lost vacation or any other reason. I had no vacation plans cancelled, yet am bummed about not being able to see son, daughter, grandkids. While many are dealing with far more serious issues, any of us has the right to feel disappointment. That is being human, not insensitive."
"Of course you are, my comment was not meant to be a criticism. Your post simply reminded me that I am blessed and grateful that I, unlike others, still have a maintained income and am still healthy and well."
The Supreme Court opinion in Jacobsen v Massachusetts says vaccines can be mandated
"Of course. By saying I was bummed, it was never meant to minimize the events of the world. I think it’s ok to be disappointed and grateful at the same time."
"Yup, you have hit the nail on the head!!! Have been happily vacationing numerous times on GC for many decades, but sadly not now at all wanting to anticipate going there anytime soon. Shut down the lights Cayman for your foreseeable tourism future. Tragic and sad but sending best thoughts.Edited: 9:23 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"""at some point everybody needs to find balance between risk and being locked up by the government over the fear that you might get sick""I'll support your right to accept any personal risk you want, but your right to impose risks on other people is a very different matter and the restrictions being enacted aren't to prevent you from getting sick. When young people gather because they think they're immune or won't get a bad case, and when 100 or more people happily gather for a church service because they think their god that will let them catch it at the grocery store will protect them at a church service I promise I'll call them morons, but a lot of them will get another name: carriers. Without social distancing one carrier can potentially be the cause of hundreds or even thousands of cases. I don't want the government to limit my freedoms, but an important government function is protecting us from other people and that sometimes means restricting our right to do things that can endanger others.""there is a difference between life and a life worth living.""Does it make more sense as ""quality over quantity""? I don't know what your friend's specific thoughts were, but there are certainly things that could make me decide to check out on my own terms. In addition to terminal illnesses a good enough pandemic or anything else that pretty much totally destroys the economy could potentially make the list, because I'm old enough to have about zero interest in spending all of my time hunting, farming, and defending what little I have left from those who would try to take it. Of course it's way, way too soon to be reaching for the plug based on the current effect of the virus, but I can see how it might prompt people to philosophize about it.""how many millions of living victims are we willing to accept?""I'm not positive what your meaning is, but it sounds like the ""cure is worse than the disease"" argument. Anyone who's paying attention has heard a lot of doom and gloom about the economy, and some politicians have been suggesting that a lot of grandparents should (and may even be happy to) sacrifice themselves for the greater good, although most bury that part of their ideas by focusing on the economic costs and benefits. Based on the news headlines I've seen most people won't see the stories about the economic cost of *not* deliberately shuttering the economy unless they make a point of looking. There are plenty of articles on the subject out there. Here's a link to one of them: https:/…"
