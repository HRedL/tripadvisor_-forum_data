"I will be traveling with my daughter, sister and niece to visit my older daughter for the festivities on the 14th. My youngest daughter is only 19 will she be able to get into bars as long as she is with me? I know the bar crawls require you to be 21 and she really doesn't want to be left behind. We are hoping to still get in on some of the fun even though she is under age. Thanks!"
Not on St. Patrick's day. The bars have lines and no one under 21 is getting in.
It's up to each establishment.
"I don’t know about the suburbs Rick but in the city: no. She won’t be able to get in a bar. No bar is going to risk their liquor license. Every bar, Irish or not, will have a big burly bouncer checking IDs at the door all day. St Pat’s will have full blown police presence. She will be able to get into a restaurant that has a liquor license but she will not be sold an alcoholic drink. This underage drinking question is asked often and the answer is the same: no. You’d have fun reading all our visitors’ plans to circumvent the law. Some of them are actually quite ingenious.Edited: 2:44 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Maybe you want to look at some of the events taking place -the Irish-American Heritage Center is having a post-parade party, plus they generally have music on Friday nights. Also, Misericordia is having a fundraiser after the parade in the south Loop area, and Old St Patrick’s Church is having a post-parade fundraiser in a tent after the parade as well. Those would be open to all ages."
Pick a restaurant not a bar only and she can get in or leave the 19 at home for a few years. Sorry it is the law & they are pretty strict on St Pat’s weekend. Honestly hard to understand the desire to stand in line this weekend when the weather may not be it’s best. Enjoy
"Warrior Jan thank you for your kind suggestions. That was helpful. I was not questioning the law, nor am I condoning underage drinking. I was simply trying to gauge if I needed to ask my youngest to make other plans for the weekend. Thanks"
https:/…20.pdfCall Chief O’Neill’s I am guessing most of their stuff will be for all ages.
"Yes, if you are planning on going to actual bars, she will not be allowed in. Most Chicago bars will card you no matter how old you are/lookNot sure what they are doing allowing, but check Emerald Loop, Elephant and Castle, Beacon Tavern and Hoyt's. All near the river and technically restaurants, but I know in the past they have had St. Patrick Day celebrations, but don't know their rules for that day"
The parade is cancelled = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
Great news!
Virus hit downtown = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
Dont really see how that is great news. Everyone will be out in the bars regardless. Party on people!
I'm not a fan of the suburban teenagers puking everywhere in the morning. Totally fine with people packing the bars on Saturday.
"In case you don't want to bother with the link, or cannot access the Tribune website, Chicago has cancelled (or ""postponed"" as Mayor Lightfoot said) Saturday’s downtown parade *and* dyeing of the Chicago River, Sunday’s South Side Irish Parade, and Sunday's NorthWest Irish Parade (in the Norwood Park neighborhood)."
I will give you that much. I am 40 and go yearly. We enjoy the river dying and then bar hopping to see the Rovers etc... The suburbanites peeing on trees was a little much last year!
"Yuck! Ya, the river is really cool and fun to watch."
"How do you ‘postpone’ the St. Patrick’s Day parade, as opposed to cancelling it, when the whole idea is celebrating around March 17?"
$$$$ - the city won’t pass on an opportunity to reschedule the parade in order to support the local economy.
"“Party on people”. Really? “Everyone will be out in the bars regardless”. Yes, that’s the problem. One sneeze in a crowded bar may infect dozens. Have you been paying attention to this, now official, international pandemic?"
Agree that “postpone” is a stupid word. I’m increasingly getting annoyed with this Mayor. Maybe she means postponed until next year.
