Should I be concerned about visiting. Anybody know of anyone personally that has had it?
"No, you should not be concerned. The disease seems to have run its course on St Thomas. Knew quite s few people who had it, but they all recovered. Just use repellent if you go hiking or are out at dusk."
"You should bring bug spray and use it. Although the cases on STT are significantly down, it is not gone so you still need to protect yourself, which you should do anyway. Also the mosquitoes that carry chikungunya bite during the day as opposed to those who carry dengue fever which mostly bite at between dusk and dawn."
"I know dozens of people who've had it and the symptoms vary in intensity but there's no question that the younger you are the quicker the recovery. Babies and children usually slough it off within 2-3 days while, on the other end of the spectrum, the over 60s have lingering symptoms for several weeks to several months. Standard basics for anyone visiting here, regardless of time of year, are Deet-containing repellent and sunscreen!"
"Yes, I know people who had it. Worst part is well over. But it does linger. It's like really bad arthritis, they say. And the docs tell you to keep moving. I'm just back and knock wood I only saw 2 mosquitoes the whole time. I took Deet along, but never opened the package."
These two mosquitoes you saw had dozens of friends and family lurking close by. I very much hope that nobody will follow your example of bringing repellent and not using it.
Saffie11 Everything I read says the numbers are going up not down. Can you point me to a website that backs up what your saying or is this just personal experience? Sorry if that sounds confrontational don't know how else to word that. Nothing but respect for you guys : ) It would really ruin a vacation wouldn't it?
virginislandsdailynews.com/news/chikungunya-…You can also go to the CDC website and see the week-by-week statistics which demonstrate the considerable drop in cases on STT and STJ.
It is also starting to drop in STX. Here is the graph from the USVI Health Dept.Week 47 is the week before Thanksgiving.healthvi.org/news/chik-weekly-report/wk47_Ch…
Thanks guys!
"Yes, you should be concerned and use plenty of Mosquito/Bug spray that has Lemon Eucalyptus as one of its' ingredients...Many people have gotten this Mosquito-Borne virus and it is like the Flu, only much worse in its' symptoms.I've met several people that have gotten it and they still have joint pain, months after and have relapses of the symptoms...I've done quite a bit of research on it and it has spread greatly from Africa, India, Europe and now to the Caribbean...it has even spread within tourists to their home town, so do your family & friends a favor and don't take it back home for those Mosquitoes to spread around your state.You will become a Vector...(a place for other Mosquitos to take the disease from you and spread it.)Herbally,Dr. Eshe"
"As much as I hate it, you need bug spray with DEET. I am a mosquito magnet and none of the herbal/natural stuff works for me and I have tried it all. But, as bad as it is for you, the DEET does work."
"Yes, I know...I used one for the past 3 weeks with Lemon Eucalyptus and it worked fine...I walked with it in my purse...and sprayed myself every 3 hours or so...It's called ""REPEL"" and is has Lemon Eucalyptus and it works so great...I get what you mean on the Poisoning of our systems, when using DEET, to keep away Mosquitoes....they kind of win, when we do that don't they?? (not being sarcastic)Dr. Eshe"
"And Mosquitoes LOVE ME, Too...LOL~Dr. Eshe"
"If a product containing lemon eucalyptus works for you then that's good - but it's not a product I would recommend any visitor unaccustomed to the tropics using, nor any other ""natural"" repellent. A Deet-containing repellent virtually assures that you won't be bitten. Like dengue which has been with us for many years, chikungunya is likewise not going to go away. Neither are pleasant souvenirs of a vacation although the upside of chikungunya is that once you've had it you're immune from it in the future while dengue can be contracted again. No point taking chances!"
"With Chikungunya, one continues to have symptoms for months and years after the original infection....There is an entirely new type of Rheumatoid Arthritis that is stumping Dr's across the globe, because nothing reduces this joint pain....And if you do enough research on it, there are many recommendations for the Lemon Eucalyptus...where do you think many drugs come from? Plants.....I will recommend Mosquito repellant that has Lemon Eucalyptus for everyone, especially Women and Men in their child-bearing years....Dr. Eshe"
"The symptoms and recovery time are varied, as pointed out in an earlier post. I'm very well aware that many drugs ""come from"" plants but as you prefer to recommend repellents with a lemon eucalyptus base I'll continue to recommend a Deet-containing repellent as being the most effective for visitors.Edited: 5 years ago "
"With all due respect, that is not entirely correct. Chikungunya is not a new type of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is a viral infection caused by mosquitoes. It is true that for a small group of people who contract it, it can cause RA type symptoms for a long time after the initial infection. The same type of thing happens with chronic Lyme disease, but Chikungunya is not a type of RA and most people recover within a week or so."

That's too bad. If you'd done your research you would know that the incidence of new cases has dropped to near zero and that of the few babies who've contracted the virus the recovery rate is 100% after a couple of days.
"Had as in past tense? Too bad indeed. As StTRes's points out transmission has fallen to near zero. And it's actually been zero in St T and St J for weeks (approaching months) with just a few cases reported in St Croix during the first week of Jan. Your sampling method of the people you asked also points to a bit of bad luck indeed. One would be led to believe that 80% of the islands population was infected when the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases totals just over 1.5% I will grant that some folks never went to an M.D. and were therefore never reported but really?I can see from your I.D. that you are from West Palm in Florida. Were you aware that he disease and the mosquito that carries it is present in Florida too? Florida has seen only a handful of cases but keep asking and I'm sure you'll find someone who's had it."
"Our marina in the Brenner Bay (the lagoon) on STT was one of the epicenters of Chik-V on St. Thomas. Anecdotally, the peak was June-September with no new cases in December and January, as reported by our favorite bartenders at Cariga's.We wear bug spray and take reasonable precautions with bug screens on our boat. What's changed for us? Still five varieties of Dengue out there, even if Chik-V is gone.Cheers, RickG"

Perhaps the mosquitoes in Alaska are free from disease but then again they suck more blood then a full grown vampire and are as large as pterodactyls so just maybe could fly away with with a diaper wearing baby or two.Edited: 5 years ago 
Whats the latest update on this?On http://www.healthvi.org/news/index.html I do not see any new updates after Jan 22Is the latest info available on a different link?Thanks
There are no new updates as there have been no new reported cases for a few months. The epidemic has run its course but like dengue it's still around so just observe the usual precautions and use a Deet-containing repellent during your visit.
How much DEET should the repellent contain in order to be effective? Is 25% good enough?
Plenty good enough.
From Wikipedia as you will see the CDC according to this reports says no - you want 30-50 but since no new cases of Chikungunya have been reported in 5 months you may want to scale back if you are concerned about DEET.DEET is often sold and used in spray or lotion in concentrations up to 100%.[12] Consumer Reports found a direct correlation between DEET concentration and hours of protection against insect bites. 100% DEET was found to offer up to 12 hours of protection while several lower concentration DEET formulations (20%-34%) offered 3–6 hours of protection. Other research has corroborated the effectiveness of DEET. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 30-50% DEET to prevent the spread of pathogens carried by insects
