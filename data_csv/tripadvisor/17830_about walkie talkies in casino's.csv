"Hi, I just called Paris hotel and thought I'd just double check on the walkies in the casino's and this lady told me NO, they are against casino regulations.Bonnie"
No I'm not nuts but I'm going to reply to this message myself.I decided to call the Flammingo because it is part of Harrah's and asked them t he same question and he checked with security and YES you can use walkies in all of there 6 hotels.I suggested he tell the lady at Paris about it.Bonnie
"Problem is... they may not work at all. You can try, but my experience is... concrete&steel = no workie. "
This doesn't surprise me at all. The hassle/scrutiny that security would give you wouldn't be worth the convenience IMHO. How many blackjack players had an evil thought or two race through their minds when a poster reported that Rio allows it (lol)?
cell phones work nice inside.
Can you play Laser Tag in the casinos?
Why not just buy 2 disposable cell phones when you get to LV? They're cheap and they work in casinos. I would think walkie talkies would be annoying as all get out.
We used to take nextel phones to the casino to use the chirp function but in some places reception sucked so it made it moot. Now we text each other which is cheaper on my cell plan. I use Virgin Mobile and my sister has AT&T and we had no issues. US Cellular for my mom was spotty.You won't be able to use walkies or cell phones at any sportsbook. They may discourage them at the tables if they are disruptive.
We use our Nextel direct connect function and it works good. Especially when one of us sleeps in and the other is up and about earlier. 
"Last thing I want to hear is you and your walkie talkie friendblabbing with your volume turned all the way up.It is getting crazy now with all these folks with no cell phone manners, let alone now having to force me to listen to both of you.Geez."
"Well Player21, let us know when you will be there so we won't annoy you with our one or two calls on the walkie.If you must know we just thought it would be a good idea to find each other when it was time to move on, not to carry on a conversation. just location.By the way any idiot when know you could not use them at the tables. (don't do tables anyway).So sorry to have annoyed you, geez I didn't know."
"Good on you, 21Player! Not sure if ill-mannered people are just attracted to those walkie-talkie phones, or what. It is an epidemic here in the South, where every redneck has one and insists on a loud conversation in the restaurant about Cousin Rufus' colonoscopy..."
"We are not rednecks or ill mannered people, but you have heard the last from me on this rude forum. One rude person is fine but 2 I don't need.Sorry for any inconvience for you all.Truly not a redneck or ill mannered, but I could see how one could end up being ill mannered."
"Ahh canadians. Whaddya gonna do a boot it? Take off ya hoser. In all seriousness there, Bonnie. Relax. Doesn't it irritate YOU when people are chatting it up on 2 way/walkies? No one said YOU were gonna do it. Just dont. Use a cell, or text. Or get an ear piece. Or arrange meeting times/places. Thats all. Unless you are 10 feet away, you wont get much if any reception. And if you are 10 feet away you'd BETTER NOT be using a walkee."
"Bump for canadia, eh. I am aboot to...err...ontario...guess thats frenchie...lol assault by a canadian stick figure...lol"
