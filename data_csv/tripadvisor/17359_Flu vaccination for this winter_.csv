"Hello,We are visiting Singapore and Australia from 18 July till 8th of August. I heard it is the flu season in Australia and I was wondering if we should get any vaccines?We are from Bulgaria, 23 and 22 years old, pretty good health, no major problems like heart deseases, asthma or so on. We have just gone past our winter (flu season) here and I don't know how we should proceed with this? Is the situation really serious in Queensland or tha chances to catch e flu are the same like catching one here in Europe during our winter?What kind of flu is the epidemic? Is this the swine flu? Not to mention that we probably do not have vaccine for the southern hamisphere here yet.... not sure about this.I am really not familiar with the healt situation on the other side of the globe, so anything will be helpful.Thanks!Edited: 5 years ago "
"It's not an epidemic, it's just the normal flu season, not swine flu. Your chances of getting it are the about the same as if you are at home."
I would get vaccinated. Have had flu when I was on holiday. It was horrible and wasted a couple of special days in Rio for me.

"No point in getting vaccinated before you arrive because the vaccine here is developed for the flu strains present in this country this winter. There are so many strains of the flu virus that no one vaccine can effectively give protection against all of them. Since the vaccine takes a couple of weeks to be effective, there's no point in you having it done once you arrive either. Rug up, stay away from people who sneeze in your face and enjoy your holiday."
"If you want to have a shot you would have to do it here and they are starting to close them down ... it's a personal decision, and it's just the regular flu ... nothing special. Just wash you hands regularly and be careful. The shot is similar to the one from the northern hemisphere's 2014-15 winter."
"Hi emel49, the flu needles were late this year, because they were factoring in flu strains which had been prevalent in the northern hemisphere during their flu season, so I would get it if you usually do so, or make this a special reason to, because I was on holiday."
"I have naver got a vaccine agaist flu in my country. So I guess there is no point to get one now. If the chances are the same as here in Europe then it's okay. I tought there is some kind of serious epidemic in Australia now, not just regular winter (flu season) like here.emel49, that is what I tought too. No point of getting vaccine here, as it will be different + no point of getting one there, as It will need 2 weeks to start taking effect. :)Thanks for the answers, we'll wash our hands, stay away from crowds and eat more vegatables and fruites. Normal measures to lower the chances of catching a flu.Edited: 5 years ago "
We always visit the Travel Doctor before we travel to the Northern Hemisphere. They always recommend flu vaccination for the reason that Sue has stated. So yes if you get it before you come you will be protected from most strains of flu.But its up to you of course
