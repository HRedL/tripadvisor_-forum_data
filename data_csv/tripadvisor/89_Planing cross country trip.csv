Hi I am planning on taking my first cross country train ride starting in Chicago going west which route might I enjoy the most scenic wise. I might fly back or take the 2nd place route back thank you for any advice you people out there have for me
"California Zephyr to the San Francisco Bay area is the most scenic.The rest in order of scenery are.2. Southwest Chief. Red rock cliffs and Glorietta and Raton passes.3. Empire Builder. Northern Rockies, but the time in them is short. Lots of flat hammered sh*t eastern Montana and North Dakota. Most of the 2nd day (either direction) is in that, the Rockies are a couple hours in the morning (east) or early evening (west).3. Sunset/Texas Eagle. Desert. Not much in the way of mountains"
California Zephyr is the best and I would say come back on south west chief. To get to Los Angeles from emeryville you take the coast starlight
Thanks for the info
"What is your destination? COVID plagued Southern California (LA), COVID plagued Northern California; COVID plagued Portland,Oregon or COVID plagued Seattle .? There are 4 different Chicago to the West Coast trains. Each of them unique. Unfortunately, Amtrak is running as essential transportation, not a vacation experience at this time."
I should have said I was planning for next summer may or June hopefully it’s safer then
Hopefully there will be a COVID-19 vaccine by then.
"If your plan is for when this pandemic is over, there are a couple of round trip routes you should look into. Kirkville N.Y. You may want to start in Syracuse. Get to the Amtrak hub in Chicago. Hopefully Chicago will be open for visitors again. From Chicago you can take the Texas Eagle or the Southwest Chief to LA . You could also take the City of New Orleans From Chicago to New Orleans to catch the Sunset Limited to LA. The Coast Starlight travels north out of LA to SF/Emeryville or north to either Portland OR or Seattle Wa. From SF/Emeryville you can take the California Zephyr back to Chicago with or without stop offs along the way. From Portland and/or Seattle you can take the Empire Builder to Chicago with or without stop offs along the way. Of course you can take any of these routes East-west or west-East. You can even go through New York City and catch the Crescent to NOLA or the 3 day a week Cardinal train to Chicago. Or the Capitol Limited between Wash DC and Chicago. When you decide, get back to us.Edited: 6:21 pm, August 09, 2020 "
Wow you really gave me the full run down on routes thanks
How can I set up a vacation trip to Sandiego by train from Guilford CT.
"Hi Henry,As RescueTeam mentioned, you should probably create a new topic for your question. I would recommend that you include more details such as the number of people, when you would like to travel, any stop-overs you'd like to make and how long you would like to travel for and the type of accommodations you are interested in (coach seat, sleeper, etc)."
"Henry... Welcome to TA train forum. There is a black box “ask a question “ at the top of the forum page. In the meantime, go to www.amtrak.com.Edited: 11:21 am, August 10, 2020 "
