I’m curious what you hear on the local news about this virus? Considering Kyoto’s popularity with the Chinese are there any restrictions or precautions at airports taking place?

"Thank you Dave for a very interesting article. Shot, I appreciate your candor and will try to keep abreast of the situation. That was truly a scary statement to read. Please keep us posted on this forum. May is not that far away any more and although a lot of money is invested in our trip we are starting to get nervous."
I'm scheduled to visit Japan in mid April... very keen to see if Japan successfully stops this from spreading to their population with the holiday tourism beginning.
I'll be in Osaka-Sapporo-Tokyo-Kyoto starting next week. Do you think it is still safe?
"China just announced the cancellation of all group tours to foreign countries starting on the 27th, which is said to stop 7 million Chinese from going out of China during the Lunar New Year Holidays. The top destination for them is Japan and the majority of Chinese take group tours, so this move will effectively stop most Chinese from coming into Japan. I sincerely hope this will stop a wide spread of coronavirus in Japan:https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl…"
"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/clone…Shibuyakko's yahoo news quote may not be available outside of Japan. Above Al Jazeera has reported similar stories in English.The suspension order of Chinese tour will damage the travel industry in Japan. They has been depending on the tourists from Asian countries, especially from South Korea, China, and Taiwan.I have a feeling that this has already been a global issue."
>>The suspension order of Chinese tour will damage the travel industry in Japan.<<It sure will. But it's the right move by Chinese government. People's safety/health should always be the top priority. I'm actually thinking about making a quick trip to Japan. I bet hotels are really cheap now :-)
"@ETflyer, there's no problem reading the news from Australia :) and thanks for sharing the news @ Dr. Shibuyakko. It's definitely a global thing now. https://au.yahoo.com/news/breaking-first-cas…"
I'm reassured to hear that the Chinese government is taking prudent steps to protect the public both within and outside its borders.
"Yahoo news is the summary list provider. When I send its URL to my friends in Brisbane and Singapore, sometimes they say they're refused to access it. It may depend on the new source provider."
"Dr. Shibuyyako, we all share that hope!! The future of this virus depends upon China’s actions and regulations."
"I just heard tonight in a local bar in Gion that Chinese people are able to drive out of the city that’s quarantined and then flying to Japan out of another city and the Chinese government and Chinese tourists are lying about everything. Yesterday in Kōbe, all of my the elderly Japanese people I was with (19 people) all said that “Kyōto is dangerous” right now due to the over 700,000 Chinese people flocking to japan for Chinese New Year and potentially from filthy cities carrying the disease. :("
Stay well!
"I do hope they would take the necessary medical tests and observations on those evacuating from Wuhan before releasing them to circulate freely in the general population. There willl be some inconveniences for those returning, but if even one percent of those returning has the virus and not showing any sympton, it will be devastating to the general population, including their loved ones and their families. Virus does not care what passport one holds.Edited: 11:38 am, January 26, 2020 "
"How do you protect against an undetectable virus?The news this morning reveals the ""symptomless spread"" of the coronavirus. That is, during the incubation period of 1-14 days the virus can be spread before the carrier shows any symptoms. The attempt to detect symptoms at airports as a means of protecting against the coronanvirus entering a country can only be partially effective. https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…"
"@ shotI'm not sure about being ""right."" I just heard on CNN that *IF* the coronavirus can spread during the incubation the whole prevention strategy would change in the US. But the expert stressed that this information from the Chinese health official needed to be verified as to its accuracy."
I work in tourism here in Japan and can report DRAMATICALLY reduced crowds in Kyoto in particular. Now's the time to come if you wanna avoid selfie-stick forests ^^
"Mihyun, and you would say this decline is due to the virus? Have there been confirmed cases other than the bus driver mentioned earlier?"
Total 11 people have been confirmed positive in Japan as of today (Jan 30). A female tour guide who accompanied tours from Wuhan with the driver was confirmed as we expected that she would be. 3 Japanese who returned from Wuhan on a government chartered flight have been confirmed. Two of them have no subjective symptoms.
"Of those 11 people how many of them were actually out in public in Japan instead of going straight into isolation? I would assume the japanese people brought directly from Wuhan were put directly into isolation and never exposed to the public, so not much risk to people in Japan from them at least."
"""I work in tourism here in Japan and can report DRAMATICALLY reduced crowds in Kyoto in particular. "" don't tempt me!"
"Among 11 positives, 5 are Japanese. A bus drivers, a tour guide, and 3 returned from Wuhan on Jan 29. Apparently, last 3 had been isolated area and in control from Wuhan Airport. The bus driver and the tour guide were in public space with 2 tours from Wuhan, in which there were potential infectors.Other 6 are Chinese living in Japan and returning from Wuhan, and tourists from Wuhan, as I remember.In this pandemic situation, I can't be assured for how safe and how dangerous it is now in Japan and other countries.Things have been changed since 2003. More people from China travel around the world, and more people visit China from all over the world on business and pleasure. Current coronavirus problems was first confirmed in December in Wuhan. It's been over a month since then."
The female tour guide is NOT Japanese. She seems to be a Chinese living in Osaka.
"People are reacting - ""I work in tourism"" and I have someone from a country with confirmed cases choosing not to travel - they'll take their chances in their ill equipped country. (1st world problems - they would probably be safer travelling.)"
New positives reported. Total 13 now. A female international student (Chinese) and a male foreigner resident in Mie Prefecture have been confirmed positive. TV news doesn't mention the latter nationality. Both stayed in Wuhan in the last one month duration.
"One more Chinese tour guide, who has visited Wuhan, was confirmed positive in Tokyo. Total 14."
Nationality is irrelevant. We know that folks from Wuhan and people who have come in close contact with them are the most likely to get infected.
Hi. Did you go Japan at last? My flight is next week and I wonder if it is still safe to go now or not advisable. Thank you.
We are travelling in 2 weeks too. Is it safe to travel to Japan now?
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/
"@Flyer63354025004 - your profile says Quezon, so you are in a country with confirmed cases, and travelling to another country (Japan) with confirmed cases. However, you are much more likely to get the common flu and that kills a few hundred thousand people every year (world-wide)."
Remember each of us has a different risk profile. I might feel it's perfectly fine while you might feel unsafe. You have to be your own judge.>>>We are travelling in 2 weeks too. Is it safe to travel to Japan now?
"Here are the updated figures from WHO https:/… and real-time numbers here https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Overall it is increasing 13% today or daily from last reported in China with some increase outside but still tracking less than 1% of China. Here are some different statistics and points if the site is reliable as to what age group, male or female and health status https:/…Quote: >>From the analysis of death cases, it emerges that it is mainly male, accounting for 2/3, females accounting for 1/3, and is mainly elderly, more than 80% are elderly over 60 years old, and more than 75% had underlying diseases present such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes and, in some cases, tumor.<<<Depending on your age, sex and health status such information may help to decide your rough level of risk if heading to those travel areas."
"@JapanCustomToursI would say this virus is more serious than the flu. Most of us have gotten the flu some time in our lives so it's not something unknown. There is vaccine (although not all strains) to prevent as well as effective treatment for flu. None available for this virus yet.The problem is travel insurance may not cover if we travel to Japan and unfortunate enough to contract the virus while in Japan. The medical cost will be very high overseas vs if we got the virus in home country (no out of pocket cost). We're booked for April, and asking travel insurance right now whether we'll be covered as we bought the insurance before this virus was known. As tourist we will go to all the touristy places with many other tourists which would put us in a higher risk than in home country where we could avoid these areas."
"Yes, there is a vaccine for the flu, and yet the death toll from it remains high every year. If there was not a vaccine for it (flu), then the death rate would be much higher. (Possibly more annoying is that there is a vaccine for measles and as a more contagious disease and yet the health response to that is much weaker despite the deaths that inflicts.)Also, with the number of actual cases of novel corona virus likely to be very under reported (as noted by some knowledgeable people in the medical profession), the death rates between the two might be a lot closer than is currently reported. As one of the previous posters commented, it depends on your personal risk profile. I wouldn't avoid going to Australia just because it has known cases. As Australia and Japan are both counties with cases for this particular new virus, you're at risk in both places. (Current numbers appear to be 15 out of 25 million vs 25 out of 125 million)And yes, the costs of getting sick in a different country can be high, and that is one of the uses of travel insurance. Even a simple consultation can run a few 10-thousand yen easily, and being hospitalised for can be quite expensive (and lots of people get hospitialised for flu every year).The issues I have seen regarding insurance are timing and official advisories."
"#41 the overall number of cases outside China is less than 1% and mostly under control, Japan has not increased significantly even including the recent cruise liner cases, and there is no officially warning not to travel to Japan, therefore insurance has no grounds for refusing cover at the moment. We have to watch this space and see if infections infections to change offical warnings."
"I am traveling to Japan from the US in May 2020. As a result of the recent concerns, I am considering looking into a medical insurance/coverage just in case I have to seek medical care. Does anyone have recommendations on medical coverage abroad? I have never purchased this type of coverage for travel. Please share any recommendations. Thanks!"
Go to the below site and compare policies:https://www.insuremytrip.com
"mlwheeler08, I've used the InsureMyTrip.com to purchase trip insurance every time I leave the country. On that site you can view many plans with a variety of options, however I would key into the plans that have a good amount of medical coverage that is not secondary to your insurance and some have a ""pay direct"" option. I have never had to make a claim but it's always peace of mind having it."
I have requested that #48 be removed due to website promotion.
Are the crowds still dramatically lower in the tourist areas of Kyoto?
"BenG, yes, it’s still quiet here this week. Less crowded than usual but not exactly a ghost town. It wasn’t as dead as I thought it would be on Monday night & Tuesday this week."
More cases reported in Tokyo for the last two days. Does anybody know the situation in Kyoto?
I live in Kyōto and it still seems like business as usual today. Just people are getting a little nervous today. Today was the first time I’d heard it being mentioned in our staff meeting about what to do if all schools get closed down before exams in 2 weeks. Nothing bad has happened in Kyōto yet. The situation changes daily so just keep checking.
"Thank you kobekeith for your reply. I have a trip planned on March 12-23, destination Tokyo and Kyoto . Thank you for your update, I am monitoring all possible sources."
"You’re welcome, Ana, if you look back on the other threads, I was usually downplaying it like so many others but the mood is suddenly changing. Nothing drastic. It seems like business as usual. I guess you have a couple more weeks to see what will happen."
"I will be in Tokyo/Kyoto, too during that period. I don't know if I should cancel the trip anot .... this is so frustrating"
"@christineyfs I am giving myself until the end of February to make a decision. I REALLY wouldn’t want to cancel my trip. I trying to stay positive , and think maybe it will be less crowded and we get lower hotel prices :)"
"We fly to Tokyo on Friday and are spending almost 3weeks in Japan, travelling by train to Takayama, Kanazawa, Hiroshima, Kyoto and Hakone before returning from Tokyo. It has been planned for a long time. Like others, we are anxious about being quarantined on arrival if we sneeze on the plane, or someone else does. We can’t avoid crowds when we are travelling round so anxious if the virus spreads whilst we are there. I would rather not go at all if we can’t get the holiday we planned but if we cancel we will lose all the money. Our travel insurance will cover us if we do need treatment while we are there but that would not be much consolation. Wouldn’t mind quarantine at home if we got the holiday, certainly much better than on a ship!! Half hoping that the UK government decides to pull the flights before Friday. Having said that, there are worse things in the world at present than losing a holiday."
"@Maria - I completely understand and share your concerns - we fly on March 1st.However - a positive look - there are thousands of people landing at Tokyo every day and it’s normal flu season too. I don’t think we need to worry too much about the government quarantining whole planes - there is just no way there have not been people with colds on flights coming in so far, and this hasn’t happened yet. I get the feeling that Japan are being more careful about mass quarantine now, as Diamond Princess has been difficult to manage! It’ll only be if it’s completely necessary."
"On Feb 25, my family has tickets to fly from the USA to Tokyo for our first ever visit to Japan. Tickets were purchased in November before the coronavirus outbreak happened. Is there a website that offers reliable day-to-day info on how the coronavirus is affecting Japan? Are trains running? Museums & tourist sites open? Hotels & restaurants open? I know the Emperor's birthday address has been cancelled and the Tokyo Marathon is now closed to all except elite runners to prevent crowds from spreading the virus. And some very large companies are encouraging their staff to work from home. That's all I've learned so far."
Of course trains are running here and restaurants and museums are open too. People are going about their daily lives as usual. Schools are open.
"Thanks, kobekeith! That's very helpful info. Sounds like life is pretty normal in Kyoto."
"You’re welcome... just a little more cautious than usual and kind of jittery when anyone coughs for too long nearby. Also, people are slightly uneasy when they see clearly non-Japanese Asians sit down on trains or walk into a small cafe wearing face masks that aren’t from Japan. They stand out. The positive side (for people who aren’t in the tourism business) is that places are much much less crowded these days."
"Check Japan Times or Japan News for updates.Even some people were standing without seats on Fuji Kaiyu, the restaurant which was terribly packed on New Year's days were exclusive for us for a while.Edited: 6:19 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"Global715255, Thank you for those sources. My family does not enjoy crowds, so we will enjoy visiting some sites without crowds. We will be in Tokyo most of the time, but also in Kyoto for a day or two."
"How many cases are in Tokyo up to date? Are there any cases reported in Kyoto? We supposed to stay in Tokyo for four days and then Kyoto for 5. Local people, could you recommend some alternative cities- less crowded ? Thank you !"
"The Chinese student studying in Kyoto and the Kyoto store clerk got over it during January. The Osaka and Nara cases reported also discharged from the hospital, so I think only Wakayama has some patients in Kansai area now.I guess approximately 60 cases are reported in Tokyo now. Don't forget Tokyo is a city of 13 million.Kamakura can be an alternative, especially if you're interested in Zen temples."
Correction: 29 cases in Tokyo so far.
"I know losing the tourism from Asia, even temporarily, will be devastating for people who rely on tourism in Japan. I live in Florida so I get it. That’s one reason I really hope this move (which is clearly the right thing to do) works. My kiddo has a study abroad trip in June-July...praying for all our sales things get under control quickly. But I’m really not liking the news I’m seeing right now."
Tourism isn't the only industry that will be affected. Manufacturing industry depends on the suppliers in China. Nissan Soeda-machi plant has been closed due to the short supply and stock on the vehicle parts. Restaurants also depend on the vegetables imported from China.
"We are travelling to Kyoto, Osaka and Nara this coming weekend. Do you or anyone here know what is the spread there now?"
"I’m sitting outside in the sun on a bench at a quiet temple in Kyōto right now. As far as we know right now, the virus isn’t spreading around the city. People are here wearing masks."
"Ok, what do you recommend for your first point? I'm Chinese, planning on travelling to Japan in July. I'll probably brings masks, but it'll be hot so I'll see."
"My family was scheduled to fly from USA to Tokyo today for our first ever visit to Japan. Yesterday we sadly decided to cancel our trip because of the coronavirus situation. We were especially concerned that our home country might prevent us from returning on schedule. The USA is not yet imposing a mandatory 2-3 week quarantine on all citizens returning from Japan, but it seems likely to happen in the near future and we don't want to get stuck in that situation. So we canceled our trip."

What’s bogus ? That everyone here is basically living life as usual?
"That’s all I was wondering. I’m not one to shy away from being snarky on here but wasn’t trying to be in that post. Was just wondering what bogus info was out there. Or on TripAdvisor. More than usual. :)I rarely trust the reviews on here.I do think that some people are pushing others to come or encouraging people because they have some sort of vested interest. I’ve posted about how places are less crowded and it’s enjoyable for people living here. The bright side, I guess. So I’m not hurt when people keep canceling. I don’t blame them.Edited: 7:45 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"At this point I am thinking we aren't likely to,travel within the US soon, if the virus does not abate in warm weather. I think the airports and planes are risky. I am not traveling in a mask. If it comes to that, no way."
"Neil, I answered you on the other thread you posted this question on. I said that my friends small gigs are being cancelled in March and my Ben Harper concert in Osaka for next week was cancelled today. Check with the venues."
"There’s information about confirmed cases in Japan, is there somewhere I can find out about the number of suspected cases (esp in Kyoto)? Some countries and cities publish those figures daily but I cant find similar data for Japan. Thanks."

"^ thank you. it's exactly what i'm looking for. ah but it doesn't quite show the suspected cases, in any case very helpful nonetheless.Edited: 9:16 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"https:/…newpage_00032.htmlWhat do you mean by ""suspected?""Does that mean the people while they are waiting for the test results to come out?"
"Yes something similar to this for hong kong-https://wars.vote4.hk/en/ The figures in that website represent the following:95 confirmed cases (some have been discharged, some are in in hospitals)120 currently hospitalised33 cases discharged from hospital1,770 cases ruled out (these would include people who were under self-quarantined or was quarantined in a facility)1984 = total reported Obviously the number of suspected cases would be a moving number depending on how many is confirmed or finished quarantined with no symptoms.Edited: 9:48 pm, February 29, 2020 "
I just cancelled my trip from Canada. As someone who travels solo often I am aware of the additional stresses of being by myself. I am also aware United who my flight was with is already reducing flights to Japan. This wasn’t a decision I made lightly as a young healthy individual. Everyone needs to make their own decision based upon their health and timeline. The next couple of weeks is too influx for me as a frequent traveller to go abroad at this time. I hope to be in Europe this summer and Asia this fall.
Is anyone out in Kyoto right now ? We are do to fly out from London on 15/3 to Kyoto Tokyo Hiroshima but all tourist sites closing and Tokyo Streets looking empty - any one with info on the ground in Kyoto?
"I can offer this list of breakdown of cases by prefecture, if that helps answer your question https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00657/…This list is part of my ongoing post Tokyo Cornonavirus: Is it Safe https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"Traveller500, I’m pretty sure some of my most recent posts on this thread and others talk about how life in Kyōto is mostly normal and temples, shrines, gardens, bars, cafes, restaurants etc are open."
"""all tourist sites closing and Tokyo Streets looking empty"" That is exaggeration. East Gardens of the Imperial Palace was open and I saw many International tourists there today. Tokyo Streets might be less crowded but couldn't be empty. But one thing I was quite surprised that the JR EAST Service Center at Marunouchi North Exit of Tokyo Station, which is usually quite crowded, didn't have any visitors around 3 pm. That was quite unusual."
"Hi, We are in Kyoto now. There are tourists around however many attractions in Japan are closed until March 16. You will see the sign on the websites "".... closed from Feb. 27 to Mar. 16 as a measure against the further spreading of the corona virus.""This includes main museums, Disneyland, Teamlab etc however smaller attractions and temples are open. I suggest you look at the websites of places you wish to visit. The places that are open are pretty busy but not sure how it compares to when there are no closures.Also not sure what will happen after March 16."
"We were in Kyoto a few days ago. Was pretty normal just quieter than it would have been without the virus. Hostel we stayed at was very quiet and had cancellations - but this wasn’t particularly a bad thing for us! Train stations were still busy though, restaurants/shops we’re still open and welcoming.There was like 2 confirmed cases in Kyoto so we weren’t particularly worried.Edited: 10:34 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Again, some great first-hand accounts.I live in Tokyo, and generally agree with the tone and tenor of the posts.Despite the media's focus on a subject tending to blow things out of proportion, for the moment it is mostly business as usual in Tokyo, with some notable exceptions including site closures and event cancellations.However, I also do not mean to downplay the seriousness of the situation.

I got affected - my flight in May from Bangkok to Osaka has been cancelled for all of March and due to low numbers it most likely will be cancelled through to June. But honestly i don't care i am still going to fulfill my childhood dream of visiting Japan.
"Kyoto used to have only two cases by far in early February: Both are Chinese, who worked as a tourist guide and a sales clerk of gift chop. According to local Kyoto newspapaer, dated March 5;Three more Kyoto citizens have infected with corona virus. Two of them went Live Music House in Osaka, where is another cluster with 15 people infected. One young lady worked at a bank on Jyujyo Street and at MacDonald Kishoin at night after she went to Osaka. Another lady also continued to work at sales office of a company for data entry work. 5th citizen worked at an office in Osaka and continued to commute on trains after infection."
