Forget the British Government self help is the solution if you are stuck - https:/â€¦
It just staggers me that it took some people so long to realise what needed to be done.And that was to go home.Scott
"Scottj765, agreed. It is true a lot of people booked a flight, or sometimes two or three to go home that were cancelled but not yet refunded. However yesterday there was one person on the UK Embassy website complaining that because of Thursday night's restrictions she couldn't get off Koh Rong."
"Alistair - great article. One person can make a difference and in this instance it was Jerry Lewis. Sometimes, or sadly more and more everyday lately, people have to learn to help themselves as the governments of the world are totally ill prepared and lost themselves."
#1 Yes I agree with you although I have more sympathy for those stuck in Cambodia than Thailand as the closure of borders came very quickly and unlike Thailand there are not so many flights worldwide from PPFortunately I listened to the advice of my friends in Chi Phat and did not even come to Cambodia this April and then got myself back home from Thailand when I realised that the two week cancellation of flights by Emirates was likely to be for much longer - indeed my flight home in May was cancelled 10 days ago or so.
"""Sometimes, or sadly more and more everyday lately, people have to learn to help themselves...""Yep, terrible when people should have to actually take responsibility for their own actions, and then go and do the right thing.Scott"
"With the number of cases of Covid-19 in the UK and the extremely high number of deaths, perhaps Cambodia would have been a safer option."
#6 true but the last thing the Cambodians need is foreigners bringing in with them the disease
#7 This post is about foreigners who are already here.
