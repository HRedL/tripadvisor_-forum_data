emirates flight prices are coming down...Corona virus effects...Just checked flights that are already booked for the family are now £200 cheaper
"Not for all Emirates flightsFlights from Newcastle out to Bangkok are the same price now for May 2020 as they were 6 months ago, give or take a £ or two"
Emirates is also waiving charges for booking changes.

I believe you can even change your booking on the same day but preferable before 12 hours from your flight departure time.
i think unless your on a fully flex fare there is a charge with emirates of around 300 pound pp to change the dates plus tax. i dont think you can change if booked via a agent though unless it is specified in the conditions of fare sale through them.
"currently on their web site if you book by 31 march they are offering free cancellation and changes , not sure if this applies to historic booking, fares i didnt think were cheaper."
Yes the free cancellation and change fees applies to old booking as well
"Maher ... I've seen the free 'change' information, but it was not free 'cancellation' for older bookings (before March 7) ... or has this now changed?"
"Of course, the correct answer is - it depends.For example, if routing is a factor you could be eligible for a refund. Otherwise, you could be in the realms of a fee waiver, or a rebooking or other course of action.Best to check here before any bookings, and if there's the one thing this CV has shown, it's the benefits of booking direct rather than through agents (if only for clearer comms)https:/…3515Edited: 8:57 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Shaun ... are you talking to me?""Best to check here before any bookings, ..."" ? Check 'here' for what?There apparently has been a blanket statement by Emirates that 'change fees' will be waived. I was not aware of 'cancellation fees' being similarly waived. Regardless of ""routing"" or anything - a factor or not. That was my question (to Maher.)And by the way, typically I book 'direct' ... and never with the ""free cancellation"" that might increase the price by 40% or so. (Reminiscent of ""free drinks"" if you pay extra for club access. Yeah. They're free.) You'll find that the money saved over the years allows you do do a no-show with money in your pocket ..."
"Nope Cookie, just a general musing. No need for a Travis Bickle :-)It was just to indicate that Emirates have a web page directly to address all issues like this, and as the news changes so quickly, it could be likely that previously-given advice is updated.Bottom line is - I tend to agree with you on your points, and the cancellation offer isn't across the board according to that link."
"Yes, I think that the information given in the earlier post by Maher (information that would be very important to some people) is incorrect. Cancellation fees have not been waived for earlier purchased tickets.And, why would they be, After all, there are 'fare conditions' ... not to be confused with 'fair conditions.' If Spring Break was moved up 2 weeks ... making it impossible for people to fly ... well, hey, it's a business and they have to make billions also. These people should have flown ""flex plus"" ... silly rabbits .... or, wait a second! That would add AED 1000 or more to the price of a ticket. If they fly a lot, probably flying 'saver' means that they still have money in their pocket (as mentioned regarding 'free' cancellation earlier.)Anyway Shaun ... I'm going for a beer in what will be a nearly vacant bar. Gotta prop up the economy. Doing my part. Cheers ..."

"#13Welcome to the forums...Perhaps the UAE it isn’t the place for you, although it’s far from safe in The Netherlands, where your profile says you live, , with 804 diagnosed cases and 5 deaths in your country, whilst the UAE currently has 85 confirmed diagnoses and no deaths reported..“ engage your brain “?"
"i dont think anyone really books flex plus for their own leisure trip regardless of flying class because of the massive fare increase . i see why they are offering free changes it continues to secure revenue for them with you travelling at a later date, should you be unable to travel which is currently ok at the moment - well at least as of today for the UAE. No one will offer a free cancellation at their cost ie some profit as they will push you down the route of the insurance company. i think a lot of the smaller agents are at very much a high risk of failing if no revenue being collected for future travel.Curious though how do people on here feel the insurance industry will treat claims for people paid up with tickets issued and not able to travel. i know others that have been affected but not flying to the uae but very early days for insurance response as of yet.just scanting the net and can anyone give a clear idea on atol v atol and abta - seems to me atol offer little protection only for companies uk based going into administration and pretty similar to abta as well, travel insurance for cancellation but not company failure , and no idea how the credit card protection works - any opinions for clarity."

"hay shaun on a more lighter note you and cccookie should get together for a beer, you know what they say the people you think on meeting you will like you hate but the ones your apprehensive about are mates for life - i recon the latter applies and you two can have a right old gossip whilst both giving vital updates whilst sipping the hop lol"
Sounds like a splendid idea lovedogs ... he and I will have to get out before the nightclubs are shuttered ...!
It truly couldn't 'blow over' fast enough.Which is ok. I'll have 2 pints ... if the nightclubs are still open :)
good i gave a helpful suggestion guys - enjoy. Wouldn't it be weird if you actually knew each other without knowing it. Need to keep spirits up in these bonkers times.
"Hello! I made a booking directly from Emirates on February the 2nd and departure is on April 11th without free cancellation option. Since I'm not really experienced flyer and traveler, I'm not sure I understand current Emirates policy about free waivers because of COVID-19, especially Terms&condition section: https:/… Do I have right to free change of date (not including diffrences in fare between currently booked flight and possible new flight)? And if that is true, what is the latest date I can change my departure to?And I guess cancellation is not free option in any case?Sorry If answer is obvious on Emirates website, but I really don't have expirience in this area"
"Josip, the first thing to check is - are you actually restricted? That is, is your country on a ""no go"" or blocked country?Here is the Emirates page for CV >>> https:/…3515So the first step is to see if you're eligbile...."
"I'm from Croatia and this trip is to Japan. Currently there are no strict restrictions and we are not on list on Emirates page. There are only recommendations form croatian foreign affairs ministry against traveling which I know aren't enough. But since it states on Emirates website ""Any booking made on or before 31 March 2020 now comes with the option to adjust your travel dates at zero charges."" I thought it doesn't matter which country you are flying from or to."
@shaun c nowhere on Emirates site does it say you need to be on restricted country to get refund unless I am not reading correct. It just lists the country where no flights are running.
Hi can you call me as we have also book almost similar dates. +918861688884
"Emirates have cancelled some of their Europe flights until end of April, and possibly reducing their flights to UK as well. There will be no surprise if everything comes to a grinding halt soon. Best thing is not to consider any travel, no matter where you are. Airlines in general would allow free or minimal cost cancellations. Emirates is only dealing with flights for next 72 hours, not others. And it is a dynamic situation, every day for next 72."
"A pop-up on the Emirates website says:""Enjoy full flexibility with zero cancellation and change fees. Book with peace of mind by 31 March and if you need to change your booking in the future, we will waive any cancellation and change fees.""So it seems that it could be a reasonable time to book. If you can't fly, it appears that you can at least get a full refund; even in the event of a 'saver' economy ticket. Actually being able to fly worry-free in the next couple of months is a different matter. But if you're booking ahead to fly in July, for example, it might be a good time."
Thanks for posting updates and personal experiences. I booked to fly Emirates to Dubai on April 8 (flights booked at end of Feb). I booked through lastminute.com so have been trying to contact them to see what my options are - reading the Emirates advice it seems I may be able to change dates without charge but havn't seen any clear info on cancellation options - this would obviously be my preference! appreciate any updates on experiences of folks tackling similar issues!
"Out of curiosity, did you check the Emirates website for their prices before booking with 'lastminute.com' or is there a different and more compelling reason to book with 'lastminute' ?When canceling a booking (made with Emirates) there was a comment to include as a reason when cancelling ... ""... coronavirus"" and it was *hoped* that with this they would waive the cancellation fees. The jury is still out. Many travellers living in Dubai had to cancel (or move dates to an unknown) as they were caught off guard with the dates of Spring Break being moved up by 2 weeks (of course, typically they would have booked well in advance.)While I can't speak for Emirates, typically hotels say ""talk to them"" when you try to amend a booking made by a 3rd party. When cancelling, Emirates had similar questions and boxes to check on how you did your booking. Lastminute may be licking their chops awaiting your request, and naturally their fee ..."
"@ccC00kie yeah, I'm a pretty seasoned traveller and normally book direct with the airline for obvious reasons. When I went to book this flight in Feb, google flights showed that the exact same flight was available for ~£40 cheaper per ticket on last minute.com (I was booking 2 flights). In hindsight this would be easier to manage had i gone direct through Emirates. Although I imagine my rights will still be the same, but i'll just have to go through the third party (LM.com) in order to make this happen which is a pain given their poor customer service provision atm."
"Good luck Chris.I don't even bother comparing prices anymore. Frequently I use a 3rd party site like Booking.com to see all the various hotel choices in a city. But I generally will book direct even if I can find it a bit cheaper elsewhere.I cancelled 3 separate flights with Emirates in the past few days. I'm expecting fees, and therefore I can otherwise only be pleasantly surprised.I plan on making a couple more bookings with them before March 31st to avail the free cancellation.Inshallah the worst will be over come June/July ..."
Yep.All the best! Main thing is getting through the next few months unscathed (including family and friends). Feel for the airlines/travel operators etc. But they should be treating their customers right to boost their reputations when things return to normal.Its only money but having these things sorted will be one less thing to stress about I suppose. I'll fight the good fight with last minute.com - at least its a good distraction to have atm.All the best
"By the way Chris: Before cancelling, I was e-mailed an offer to upgrade to business class (to Singapore from Dubai and vice-versa) by Emirates for a measly AED 1378 a way, in the throes of all this virus BS (which is quite a bit less than previous e-mailed offers.) Instead, regrettably, I was cancelling the next day.Anyway, this is another reason I guess to book direct. I know that it is a bit lazy of me, but so many times I see allegedly 'astounding' deals at hotels etc only to find, after looking, that I can get the same or better myself.As you say, ""it's only money."" Again, best wishes ..."
"Reality is as of today all visitors are banned, other than Diplomats or local citizens of the UAE. Please watch for updates on the ever-changing scenario, before making plans to visit UAE."
"ccC00kie, I couldnt see any flights out to Dubai from Singapore a month ahead. Good luck with the quarantine."
