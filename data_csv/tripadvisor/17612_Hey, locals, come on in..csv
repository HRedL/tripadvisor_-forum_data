"Locals specific to: (Anchorage, Girdwood, Seward, Talkeetna, Denali NP)So, how are the bugs? ::crosses fingers::Please tell me that you predict this to be the best June on record with the fewest bugs."
They are out. Seems about as bad as normal.
"Not many yet in my area - but again, I don't live near a boggy area - places like Wonder Lake are totally different. :)"
"My husband sent me some absolutely horrific YouTube videos of mosquitoes, and I am terrified. They were huge and numbered in the thousands. I see one or two a year. I can't imagine swarms. Well, I can and it makes me cry.Thanks for the heads up!"
"Where all are you planning to go? Most of those films are out in the bush . . . not typical of what you would find in most places. We have had a few bad years . . . but again, it depends on where you are at. :)"
"We plan to do some hiking in Girdwood and Seward, fishing in Talkeetna, hiking in Denali, bike riding in Anchorage. We also have some cruises and kayaking planned but I'm assuming that the mosquitos won't follow me onto the sea. But I could be wrong. They seem very persistent."
I just took a weekend road trip to Valdez and I encountered:- lots of mosquitoes in/near Valdez- lots of mosquitoes at Tolsona Wilderness Campground (about 10-15 miles west of Glenallen)I don't usually have mosquitoes at my home in east Anchorage yet they were in my backyard this morning.I have lots at my cabin in Caswell Lakes (about mile 88 of the Parks Hwy).For the areas I regularly use there are more mosquitoes than normal.
"Ugh! Okay, that means nets then since I can't wear DEET. We'll be sure to pick some up. Maybe some sort of mosquito epidemic will set upon them and they'll be gone in 2 weeks when I arrive."
"I certainly hope not! Many of our migratory birds rely on the mosquitoes for food and to feed their new young, and our flowering plants (like blueberries!) need the mosquitoes to pollinate them. So while they are a nuisance, they are a necessary nuisance :)"
"Your DEET aversion is problematic. Head nets do work well, but not for hands, ankles and back. You may consider treating your outerwear with permetherin, available at most sporting goods store. It helps."
Thanks for that tip. I used deet a couple years ago and broke out in a burning itchy rash that even caused some swelling. I was on Benadryl and out of it a good day and a half. I'll check out your recommendation and take it for a spin to make sure my skin is good with it. I appreciate it!
"Bugs away clothing by Ex Officio uses permethrin or a similar substance, not DEET. It works to keep mozzies away, and you do not have to wear the shirt next to your skin if you are concerned.https:/…bugsawayYou can find the clothing at a deep discount at Sierratradingpost.com, REIOutlet, com, and other suppliers, and there are other brands as well."
Worse than usual in Seward and HUGE this year.
"Thanks again, everyone!"
Having lived in California for 50 years I found that Alaska mosquitoes to be no worse than what you have. Except we do not have the West Nile virus (yet).
"I only get 1-2 mosquito bites a year. I am more likely to get a spider bite (which happens VERY rarely). I would say that where I live I see fewer than 10 mosquitoes a year. My sister recently went hiking to see how her ""hippy"" repellent would hold up and they didn't see any, even at dusk.I can only hope that this is the situation in Alaska!"
Eat lots of garlic - that is supposed to help. :)
"Can I just wear it around my neck, vampire style? ;)"
You betcha! :)
"Smokey, You can wear it around your neck if I can get a picture!! lol Try skin so soft. I think it is a Avon product. Do not wear dark clothing. The gnats and no see ums seem to be attracted to it. Play on the water. Very few bugs. BoatAk"
"Hello All - Which of these Avon products is most suited for 21st June - 4th July trip? No camping , No major hiking. I am doing only following hikes:Exit Glacier, Byron Glacier, Russian River Falls trail, Matanuska Glacier Hike, Rock Creek Trail, Savage Loop trail, Lake Elutna trail and Flattop Mountain trail.https:/…"
"I usually don't use bug dope - if they are somewhat bad, I start with citronella products. If they are horrible, I go to deet based products. :)"
"I just recommended the same thing to my sister. Let's start with spray on the clothes and a non-deet product and move to deet if it's not working. (Also, I've tried skin so soft and the mosquitoes didn't seem deterred.)"
"BoatAK.....you just reminded me that as a child, when the Avon lady would come to our house, my mom would stick up on the Skin So Soft lotion cause it was awesome for mosquitos! I had forgotten all about that!The mosquitos in Anchorage will never be as bad as the ones I grew up with in Fairbakns, and like coalminer, I do not bother with bug dope most of the time. I know they were bugging us this week-end, but just the usual annoyance. Deb"
"You can get Vitamin B patches from Amazon or at some drugstores. They worked for my son when we were in the Catskills. Mine made me itch so I took it off. Not sure about those Alaska monsters but maybe worth a try? Thanks for all the advice. We will be in Denali and Seward in July and I will make sure to come prepared. I hate mosquitos. Unfortunately, they like me and I feel I have already contributed enough of my blood to them"
A little worse this year...…photobucket.com/user/hogfamilyak/media/AK%2…Edited: 4 years ago 
"Oh, no."
"You think that's bad, look what's in Manitoba: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nWfvcWUJS1Q/T6CjxsATy1I/AAAAAAAAAgA/7IvXaTF_gIM/s1600/Bill+Looks+at+Mosquito.JPGAfter all the rain Winnipeg has had recently, there was a mass-hatch yesterday. I went outside last night to enjoy watching the lightning show to the north of us, and thought I'd somehow I'd walked through some portal to Wonder Lake... a few minutes of swatting at the dozens of mosquitoes landing on me was more than I was willing to endure!"
