AliR. Thanks for that update.Saudi is used as a very popular transit/stopover point.Eg Pakistan to UK via Jeddah What will happen to these flights in the next few days? Especially where passengers are just changing planes and not leaving the airport?
"Yeah, that's what I mentioned in the other thread. Either they'll have to turn all the transit lounges into quarantined areas, or ban all passengers who are transiting in the country. They can't risk someone with the virus passing it to passengers and workers in the transit area."
"SpotBoythat is mostly saudi airline's interconnecting flights will keep on going as they are till now there has been no notice about that from any other airline. as people will not pass immigration, apparently they are taking time to install scanners and to make all arrangement at immigration counters. We hope to return operations to Normal but it doesn't seems in 7-14 days."
Thanks AliR.I have relatives flying to UK via Jeddah next week
I am supposed to fly out on March 5 from Los Angeles for Umrah. I already have tourist visa and the hotels are booked in Makkah and Madinah.I called the Saudi Embassy in Washington DC this morning and was informed that I can enter Saudi Arabia with my tourist visa but will be prohibited from entering the cities of Makkah and Madinah.My hotel bookings were non-refundable and were booked through Expedia. Expedia customer support reached out to the hotel managements and informed me the bookings are fully refundable due to this travel ban.Any more information will be helpful. I was really looking forward to this holy trip.
"Waqas904You are advised to get full refund of your flights and hotels which they are bound to do due to this ban when conditions are normal then you can plan again. airlines and hotels are cooperating in regards to cancellation and rearranging trips. this is same issue here in UK passengers with only Business visa or Gulf Nationals are allowed to fly.Edited: 7:02 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Waqas904 you were told you can still travel, why aren't you going?"
ChrisHe is supposed to visit Makkah and Medina cities for UMRAH purpose where has booked hotels as well which he has mentioned he is not allowed to visit.
Thank you.You are correct. Airline is issuing a full refund for the ticket. I am working with Expedia to get the hotel refund.
AliRIs there any official website where travellers to/from/via Saudi can get travel up-to-date information?
SpotBoybest source for this information is airline's customer support and there websites like if you travel with saudi airline here are the updateshttps://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/Travel+updates+to+Saudi+Arabia+due+to+Coronavirus+(COVID-19)
Thanks AliR.Looks like my relatives won't be allowed to fly from Pakistan to UK via Jeddah.
So people going from the UK for umrah are ok it appears?
"No t_mEntry for Umrah is suspended for all.Their notifications are written in really poor English.Edited: 2:05 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Hang on, I'm confused now. That announcement mentions 25 specific countries that aren't allowed. UK is not in there. I've just told my rellies in Manchester who were set to go next week, that they'll be ok. SMH..!!"
"the_musafirYes UK is not on the list but this list is not updated, today i confirmed from embassy they said UK is not allowed with Tourist or Umrah visa until any further notice."
"SalamsI am supposed to travel for umrah on 11 March. My umrah agent told me not to cancel my ticket and wait till next week as it might re-open its doors. Have someone heard so about next week?Secondly, my ticket is with emirates and i can cancel before 11 march. My question if they remove the ban, say on Monday, and i decide not to go, i can still cancel my ticket, right?"
"I've just spoken to Saudia Airlines customer contact centre in London.They will not be accepting transit/transfer passengers in to the country and this situation will remain at least until 13th March - subject to extension depending on what happens in the world.Therefore if you are flying anywhere via any Saudi airport, your flight is not happening.I was told to contact the airline/agent where we purchased our tickets to get my relatives their refund.Edited: 3:41 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Belall20Wassalam,Ban can be lifted any time and your agent is right to wait till next week as it doesn't make any difference cancelling now or next week, but they lift the ban and you decide not to go then you might have to pay cancellation charges."
Update by Saudia Airlines.https://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/Travel+updates+to+Saudi+Arabia+due+to+Coronavirus+(COVID-19)
"As salaamu alaikumJazakumullah khair for all the information. We are a family of four scheduled to fly from Chicago to Madinah via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines on March 8th. As US citizens, we obtained the online Saudi E-visa(tourist visa) which permits Muslim visa holders to do Umrah except during the Hajj season. I called Turkish Airlines about the coronavirus ban, and they said their flights are not canceled and we will be allowed to board for the Madinah flight in Istanbul. They are not allowing boarding for all people who have Umrah visas. They will also prevent boarding of people with tourist visas from a select group of countries which are in the official ban. The US is not included.Some anecdotal information that I have obtained is that the temporary ban is in place to install thermal cameras and quarantine facilities and supposed to take about 5-7 days. In light of the above, I would like to know if anyone has flown to Madinah since the Feb 27th ban with the tourist e-visa and if they were allowed entry after arriving at Madinah airport. Would like to hear especially from Americans of their experience. I know the situation is fluid but the information from people on the ground or their friends are and relatives would be the best confirmation. Praying to Allah (SWT) to rid the world of this abomination of a disease and also to accept everyone's niyyah for Umrah even if they are physically prevented from performing it."
SHAKIL Mi have heard from a family who went from UK they went to Medina first they were allowed to board but they were not allowed to Enter Masjid e Nabwi they were only allowed to board a Tourist but cannot enter Haram or Masjid e Nabwi they were sent to a isolation camp for check ups. if you read Saudi Health Ministry announcement they have said People are not allowed to Enter Masjid e Nabwi or Haram and here it doesn't mentions any visa type which mean it's irrelevant of visa type people cannot enter. Ask your airline to confirm if they can make sure you will be able to enter Masjid e Nabwi then take any risk.
"Thank you for the updated information. I have decided that if we are allowed entry into Madinah but can't enter Masjid An Nabawi, we will just take a taxi to Jeddah. The plan is to wait out an opportunity to enter Makkah until a day before our return to the US on March 16th. Trying to stay positive that Allah (SWT) will make it possible for us to accomplish our intention."
"Last night's update from Saudia Airlines was poorly written and was very ambiguous.Today they have updated it (see link in my last post).It's a lot clearer and makes sense.They now also allow transit flights through Saudi (except from China etc).Edited: 10:02 am, February 29, 2020 "
SpotBoyI think transit is still not allowed if you are coming from country in list as per link you shared.7. Any transfer passenger who had been in one of the two countries mentioned in item (4) of this circular are not allowed to enter Saudi Arabia until 14 days later from their exit from these two countries.
"My relatives spoke to Saudia Airlines reps in Pak and they said to proceed as normal.I'm not sure I trust the reps but that what they advised.But the latest statement seems to allow transit passengers through as long as they are not from the listed countriesEdited: 11:54 am, February 29, 2020 "
Latest update from Saudia irlineshttps://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/Travel+updates+to+Saudi+Arabia+due+to+Coronavirus+(COVID-19)
SpotBoyyes now they have updated that clause now they can have a transit in jeddah.
Saudi Airline has given date that operations for KSA entry will be suspended till 13th of march and can be extended later on.
"I'm in a similar situation. Flying on the 5th of march to madinah with Saudi Airlines. I called multiple times and every time they confirmed that with tourist visa from the UK and no travel the last 15 days to a country listed entry to saudi will be granted. So when I read the masjid nabawi is closed. what does it mean? as I have currently friends there and they haven't seen any changes. They have also been allowed to travel from madinah to makkahEdited: 8:34 am, March 01, 2020 "
I have also been in touch with somebody who left the UK yesterday on a tourist visa and arrived in Jeddah early this morning. They have reached their hotel in Makkah without any challenge and will soon be completing their umrah.
@ukk88 Thank you. Can I ask if your friend is part of a group or he organised his trip himself?
"What airline did they use. Have flights booked for Sunday 8th March to madina with tourist visa also.Edited: 9:20 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Did they land in Jeddah in ""ihram"" and did immigration pose any problems?"
The question 'txs' poses is the crucial one - did the travellers enter Jeddah in ihram?
"@Hana b: This was a self-organised trip.Edited: 11:06 am, March 01, 2020 "
@Journey647257: They travelled from Heathrow with Royal Jordanian via Amman.
"It seems we are getting some positive information. If UK tourist visa holders were allowed entry into KSA yesterday, Feb 29th, and then traveled from Jeddah/Madinah to Makkah to perform Umrah, then US citizens should be able to do the same.The precautionary ban is being strictly implemented for anyone with Umrah visa and travelers from affected countries plus anyone who traveled to these countries in the last 14 days.One good recommendation is that people do Salat Al Istikhara and make dua as to whether they should embark on the journey if their flights are coming up."
"The following may help some visitors on this thread:I am planning to go for umrah during the Easter holidays and have just successfully obtained Tourist e-visas for my family today.Although there is speculation about whether people are being allowed into KSA for the purpose of umrah from the UK, I can confirm that the issuing of tourist e-visas (even when selecting the 'umrah' option) has not stopped for UK citizens.With the unpredictable nature of the virus, I thought it would be wise to secure the e-visas as soon as possible. If it means our Easter plan for umrah does not go ahead, the visas can still be used next Christmas."
Salam ali raza please advise If anybody have indefinite leave to remain can he apply for tourist evisa? Thanks
"Saqlain, yes you can but you should ask on an evisa thread rather than the CoronaVirus thread. Any further queries should be taken there."
"I called Pullman Zamzam Makkah hotel today and they mentioned to me that a Umrah group from the UK had checked in today and didn't have any issues entering Makkah. My reservation is at this hotel for March 12th, so I felt it would be best to ask them directly if they checked in guests from US/UK since the ban. Since the hotel confirmed this information, I feel some reassurance that we will be able to do Umrah in about 2 weeks time Insha'Allah.The hotel did assert that if for any reason I am unable to arrive, I should call in advance to cancel the reservation for a full refund. The reservation is non refundable but they are making an exception due to the ban."
"Another update from Saudia Airlines - -unfortunately they have used atrocious, bureacratic English which says a lot but makes little sense!https://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/c…Anyone know what 'EMDs restrictions' or 'ancillary service EMD' means?Edited: 10:08 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"An Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) is an electronic non-flight document that may be issued and used for the collection and settlement of optional services offered by an airline. These services are also referred to as ancillary services and include such options as preferred seating, baggage, and deposits."
The official line seems to be no admittance for Umrah to the Makkah & Madinah sites- however anecdotal evidence suggests people are getting through.And it is not like Saudi authorities to let people slip through.But they are letting transit passengers leave - makes sense to get them out ASAP
Thanks spotboy
Thank you. One of my friend that arrived before the ban in madinah had hardly managed to get to Makkah yesterday. She said another bus with people from the same group had to return to madinah and finally manage to use a different route to reach Makkah. Once there it doesn’t seem to be easy to move from a city to another.
"UKK88i am not sure how luckily they went as yesterday 3 families i know were denied to go for umrah yesterday.SpotBoyEMD is referred to Travel agents that they can make tickets changes, cancel or reroute without any charges."
"Thank you for your reply. I rang saudi embassy based in London and they said people with non British passport will not be able to apply for tourist visa even with my indefinite leave to remain in the uk. And for those British passport holders you cannot enter makkah and madina with tourist visa. Hope this info helpSEdited: 7:00 am, March 02, 2020 "
Lots of differing information: some getting through and others denied. It would be really beneficial if someone on the ground with a tourist e-visa who entered through Madinah or Jeddah airports after the ban to post their experience.I had seen a few posts here of people going today and March 5th Insha'Allah. Hopefully they will update us of their situation whether they are able to go or denied.
SHAKIL MAs per Rules Umrah is banned and entry to Makkah and Medina is banned. rest are may be slipping through this rule.
We're due to fly out on the 4th from the US. Not sure what to do!!
"If I was booked for the 4th, I would be cancelling and arranging for refunds whilst the airlines are openly encouraging customers to seek refunds, both air tickets, visas & any fees.I know it must be devestating to consider this - but it would be worse to travel there and be turned away from Makkah/Madinah.Edited: 10:48 am, March 02, 2020 "
"@txs: Our tickets are out of Chicago on Sunday, March 8th. We have decided that if there's no official lifting of the ban for entry into the Two Mosques by Friday, March 6th, we will postpone the trip. It's not worth the risk to take back roads or some other avenues to enter the Harams. People may slip through despite the ban, but going with family and young children, the risk is too much to handle at the moment."
ALLAH KAREEM FIRST CASE IN SAUDI ARABIA Covid-19 saudigazette.com.sa/article/590136/SAUDI-ARA…
"As salaamu alaikum. Here's the latest information I have received from our local Umra and Hajj Travel agent here in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US (https://adamtravel.com/announcement/). Saudi government has opened up Masjid An Nabawi for visitors but Masjid Al Haram is still off-limits. Also there's no restriction to boarding flights to KSA with Saudi tourist e-visa by Americans. In light of this news, our family is going to embark on the journey on March 8th, Insha'Allah. If nothing else, we will spend the time in Mssjid An Nabawi instead of spending it elsewhere during the kids spring break holidays."
SHAKIL MGood luck for your trip we wish you may have the great one. but make sure it is officially mentioned on any Gvt before embarking to any trip.
SHAKIL MI hope you have great time and pray for all muslim ummahgood to hear positive feedback I cancelled my trip to KSA today i was travelling tommorrow 4th of march from uk on umrah visa.Please give us latest update when you will reach madinah Have a nice time
@SaqlainInsha'Allah I will keep updating this thread with the facts on the ground once I reach Madinah. Sorry to hear you had to cancel. I would have too if Madinah didn't open up for us. I believe travelers from the 49 countries who are eligible for the tourist e-visa should avail it instead of the Umrah visa since it seems to be more flexible and allows the holder to do Umrah too.
SHAKIL MThanks I have pakistani passport so we could not get tourist visa
"Hello,I’m not sure if your agency has the right info. As for today all tourist visa cannot enter the country. I had this from The minister of tourism and the airline."
"hana bas per latest information Tourist visa holders can enter if they haven't been to 25 countries mentioned on their website in last 14 days or coming from Rep China, Taiwan hong kong."
Any new reports of people being allowed into Makkah?
txsYes there have been some cases where people were able to slip through but officially it's still banned to enter Holy Mosques and Haram for Umrah.
Can you kindly share the link? As I have called the airline again Saudia and they told me as per today all tourist visa cannot enter the country.
Saudia Airlines very sneakily delete their updates/announcements as if they have something to hide
"The announcement remains the same as last week. https://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/Travel+updates+to+Saudi+Arabia+due+to+Coronavirus+(COVID-19)But when I call them they say that as per today they had directive to inform all tourist visa holders that they cannot enter the country. But so far no official announcement.Edited: 5:52 pm, March 03, 2020 "
The people who are on work visa and working in ksa at the moment even they are not allowed to enter in makkah. Makkah city checkpost sent them back Just got news from KSA
"Salam Alaikom everyone,I will be flying out next Wednesday on a tourist visa (got it in January) to Jeddah from Belgium. I also have a Belgian passport. Will be visiting Madinah, Jeddah and Mecca. So my question is:1. Do ya’ll think they will allow me in If i say “I’m here for touristic reasons and will be visiting Jeddah and Riyadh.” ?2. Are there any checkpoints barring people entering Madinah and Mecca; i’ve bought a Haramain train ticket on the 12th, in the morning. (Jeddah airport - Madinah) Also i’ve a bus ticket from Madinah to Makkah?JazakAllah Khair for your answers"
I was in similar situation as you. I called the Saudi Embassy in Washington DC and was informed I can enter Saudi Arabia on tourist visa without any problem but will be prohibited from entering Madinah and Makkah. This means there are most likely checkpoints setup and you will not be allowed to enter those cities.
Abu Jafar. Looks like Waqas904 reply covers your question.
"SpotBoyThere was same rule initially that Tourist visa can enter KSA and Umrah not from UK & US but when some people appeared at Heathrow Airport they were still denied by saudi airline, Royal Jordan & Middle east airline despite of there visa type they were denied, Next day airlines like Emirates Saudi and BA announced that tourist visa can go but Umrah is prohibited so no one tried to go as there basic purpose and hotels bookings were for umrah. Now airlines are clearly asking for get your flight cancelled if traveling till 15th March and seek for refunds to KSA despite of visa type but if you want to travel you can still travel but not to Makkah & Medina.As per saudi Airline circular they published yesterday Umrah visa traveling is banned till 15th April but if you want to cancel you can and seek for refund even if you have tourist or an Umrah visa. some people are very keen to travel and paid money i understand the dedication but trust me saudi Arabai is a very difficult country to travel in Normal days if you take risk in these conditions you can expect some special kind of treatment. Rest everyone has there own choice but if i were planing/booked i would have skipped it for time being."
"Thanks AliR. Yeah, I agree. Now is the time to start processing refunds and accept that it is not meant to be this time round.Some live images of Makkah/Haram...https://ibb.co/nLK33Ywhttps://ibb.co/LPB4DLySo there are pilgrims there but surrounding area in Haram does look deserted so signs of restrictions are there.I'm guessing these are locals or those that managed to slip through.Edited: 6:48 am, March 04, 2020 "
@ #73Yes. I saw that too. Must be locals. At least they can kiss the black stone now lol
Saudi Airline has now extended it to 31st March.https://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/Travel+updates+to+Saudi+Arabia+due+to+Coronavirus+(COVID-19)
I have seen Saudi Arabia extended ban on umrah till 31st march 2020 and ask people to cancel their air tickets and hotel reservations. They may be preparing for Ramdan which they can't hold or cancel
"Thanks Journey647... for that latest update.Pretty clear cut. Guys, sort out your refunds whilst they're encouraging you to do so.This is going to drag on for months"
Saudi interior ministry suspend umrah pilgrims from the Saudi kingdom https:/…saudi-arabia
"Thanks SaqlainIn light of the statement, and this quote""Under the temporary ban Saudi nationals and residents living in the Kingdom wanting to perform Umrah will not be allowed into Islam's holiest sites.""I wonder why people are currently being allowed inside to perform tawaf etc as I showed in previous post where you can see live images from Makkah?Edited: 8:35 am, March 04, 2020 "
Still there is a lot people in makkah and madinah Search on youtube ( live makkah or madinah ) You will see live everything
You are no longer to see any updates about the coronvirus on saudi airline websitehttps://www.saudia.com/404
"Saqlain, I mentioned this earlier in reply #66.Saudia are constantly deleting their updates...it's unprofessional at best but it's more likely an attempt to cover up or hide stuff.It's shocking really but to be expected from this organisation and this country.Edited: 9:39 am, March 04, 2020 "
SpotboyYes you was right they ALLAH KAREEM
SpotBoyStopovers KSA are fine till now if they are less than 12 hours. i spoke to Saudi Airline yesterday and they said stopovers are allowed.
Has anybody tried to obtain refund for the tourist visa?It expires in 90 days and there is no way we can make another trip within 90 days.Thank you
Waqas904There is never refund for visa specially from KSA. Tourist visa cannot be cancelled it only expires in one year.
Is there any maximum time period that a tourist visa holder has to first enter the Kingdom after obtaining the visa?
"Latest update on saudi airlines website Check on the link below We spoke to the saudi airline just a minutes ago and saudi embassy as well So saudi airline said umrah visa suspended untill 31st of march after that you can go , Tourist visa holder can go but will not be allowed to enter in haramain sharif untill 31st march.But saudi embassy said they dont have any date for umrah suspension So just sharing my experience with you guys if you have anything please update here thanks https://www.saudia.com/experience/about-us/corporate-communication/press-releases-and-news/announcement/updates+due+to+coronavirus"
AFAK25No there is no specific time period to travel after obtaining visa even some people got the visa and travelled same that day.
"Thanks Ali Raza, basically this is not the same as umrah visa/family visit visa where there is a period of time the holder has to enter KSA after receiving the visa, otherwise the visa automatically expires."
"AFAK25Yes Holder of tourist visa can enter during the validity period of 1 year, and on each entry they can stay up to 180 days maximum."
Area surrounding the kabaa completely deserted today. A handful of people completing Sa'eeQuite an eerie feeling.Only local residents & those that slipped through are there
"Saudi Gazette are reporting that the restrictions on mataaf & saee in Makkah, and Rawda & old mosque in Madinah will remain for the duration of the umrah suspension.Surely they will not keep these areas closed for weeks on end? Is this an indicator that umrah might begin again soon?saudigazette.com.sa/article/590380/SAUDI-ARA…Edited: 2:08 pm, March 05, 2020 "
UKK88As per latest circular by Saudi Airline i saw today it states that Umrah ban is till 31st of March and Umrah visa holders cannot travel till 15th Apr. Normal umrah is less likely to start early due to increasing number of people being infected.
"This date of 31st March is not absolute, it's arbitrary. Meaning the authorities will assess the virus situation and act accordingly to protect both citizens and pilgrims. No one knows what the global situation will be in a week's time let alone in 4 weeks.Don't presume that because the announcements only mention 31st March, the everything will be ok after that date. This is all common sense. Don't pin your hopes on flying out there on the 1st April.Edited: 3:44 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Very sad today! Canceled my trip to the Haramain after getting full confirmation that even if allowed into Madinah, the Rawdha Mubarak has been closed off to everyone: local, expat, foreign doesn't matter. My Saudi colleague called home and got on the ground information. Called Priceline and they already had guidelines to refund the Turkish Airlines tickets, so that wasn't an issue. Pullman Zamzam Makkah is refusing to refund and instead offered me a voucher good for one year.So, as everyone is reporting, it may be a month or long wait until things get better. May Allah (SWT) help us all to avoid this tribulation. Ameen."
"7. eVisa validity7.1 The eVisa will be valid for one year from the date of issuance. 7.2 The eVisa will be valid for multiple entries, unless stated otherwise on the specific eVisa. 7.3 The maximum length of stay allowed under the eVisa is 3 months. 7.4 If you are granted an eVisa, it cannot be extended. 7.5 If the eVisa expires before entry to KSA, you must apply again and another application fee must be paid."
"As t_m says, don't use 31st March as a definitive date.Remember on the 29th Feb the date given was 13th March. This could be extended indefinitely for all we know. I don't see Umrah opening up in the timescales some are hoping/predictingI'm seriously worried about Hajj 2020."
"Brother Shakil M i feel your sadness aswel, we too was due to fly out on Sunday 8th to medina via Istanbul but from London. I booked all myself, and have now cancelled all and full refunds been accepted and awaiting refunds direct from airline and online travel site and same from hotel directly and hotel booking site.If you are having difficulty getting refunds back and if you wish you can also contact the Ministry of Hajj & Umrah on +966 92000 2814 or email them:  mohcc@haj.gov.sa and report them as hotel is in two of the holy sites and there should be leniency being applied due to this unfortunate circumstances within the kingdom.Just over a year ago we was refused entry into Saudi for umrah because of mistakes on our visas which the travel agent took full responsibility. This time round again we couldn't set foot in the blessed sites for pilgrimage. We have done Hajj some time ago so hugely feel blessed in that sense.Some people go with ease and some don't. It is all the will of Allah and i thank and praise Allah for choosing me for this tribulation and make dua to Allah to help us through this time of trial.In sha Allah this will make us stronger and one day our call is accepted."
Quite sad to see these Umrah trips having to be cancelled.You just never know if or when the opportunity with present itself again.Best of luck with claiming back as many refunds as possible
Asa. I rang Saudi Airlines this morning and they stated umrah is banned until 15th April. I was due to go over the easter break with my family. They said tourism otherwise to the rest of the country is permitted!Any advice? Is anyone thinking of going and just seeing what happens? Anywhere else to go and wait and see what happens on 15th? Or would you cancel? Am also unsure if the company will refund the tickets as bought through Skyscanner and the company is not answering the phone currently. Any advice welcome. Am in a real dilemma now and potentially may lose my air ticket fares.
"Ali AliPlease read the advice already given in this thread & also what action potential travellers have already taken in last few days.Haven't you seen the empty Haram?As for refunds, airlines are refunding customers. You'll have to keep persistingEdited: 9:38 am, March 07, 2020 "
Thank you for your message. I have read but am also hearing of uncertainty as some people are saying they may open.What are others doing if they have umrah planned over Easter? Are you cancelling now or waiting til the end of the month? Or should I just go In easter and see if I get in?
"Ali Alii suggest you to wait till the end cancelling is same if you cancel now or later, but you should keep the hope."
"Ali AliIf you want to ignore the official advice and listen 'what you are hearing' then obviously no one can stop you from going.Within the space of 7 days we've gone from zero restrictions to mid April. And that will become beginning or middle of May by next weekNo one wants to cancel. But the empty Haram, masjid Al nabwi etc should be a sign that Saudi authorities are not letting people in.AliR recommends leaving it until late to decide but things don't look promising.I don't expect Umrah to open up before HajjEdited: 11:46 am, March 07, 2020 "
Thank you brother. The company I paid for the flights through is not answering currently. Have emailed them and am waiting. Another thought came to mind - if they are allowing tourist visas - can UK nationals travel to makkah and just do the 5 daily prayers there without doing Umrah? Are they allowing people to come into makkah plain clothed?I can’t see any guidance if tourist visa into makkah also banned? I think madinah is banned.Am clutching at straws.. any guidance appreciated as I may not get my flights money back.
"@Ali Ali I feel your pain. You're in a really bad situation not of your makingPeople seem to able to enter KSA on tourist visas as long as they aren't from the 'danger' countries like China etc.I'm sure if you tried enter wearing ihram then you'd be refused entry but plain clothes, it seems people can enter Makkah and Masjid Al Haram and pray but not within touching distance of the kabaa.Its worth googling Makkah Live and watching live coverage to see what's happening there. I looked yesterday and no one was wearing ihram but things can change rapidly.I hope you can salvage something...Edited: 12:05 pm, March 08, 2020 "
".Edited: 2:14 pm, March 08, 2020 "
@Ali AliAll official websites says clearly that umrah is banned and Masjid e Nabwi entry is banned irrespective of any visa. entering saudi arabia is possible but not for Umrah. there own citizens are seen in Haram in plain clothes far from Kaba as they have made a boundary around Kaba.
Technically speaking am I allowed to check in - in my hotel across the al-haram if I am traveling on a tourist e-visa from Canada ? Are there any checkpoints from Jeddah to Maakah ?
ibn_batuta_canadaYes technically you are allowed and people who are already there are getting check in's and there are check points first at airport then in between jeddah to Makkah.
"If authorities are allowing e-toursit visa holders to enter Saudi Arabia , does that mean I can enter Al-Haram as well ? Is there a possibility I wont be allowed to enter Al-Haram premises - would appreciate if first hand info is available in this regards ? We are supposed to attend a nikah ceremony in al-hasram premises"
"ibn_batuta_canadaHotels are privately owned by international companies and they want business so they don't stop anyone if you are able to slip through all check points and reach Haram area then you would be allowed to check in the hotel but issue can be anywhere, not sure about any latest experience but when this ban started some people were stopped in Medina and kept for check up but after that no one we know has tried taking this risk."
Jazak Allah Khair for your advice
