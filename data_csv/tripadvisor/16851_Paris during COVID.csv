"I have a trip planned for Paris in the beginning of September. Everything I hear is conflicting and I am not sure which course of action to take. I want to go on my trip! Is this doable? I know they frown upon it, but has anyone successful gone and been a tourist recently? I live in California, USA and I will be arriving In Paris, France for a few days and then heading over to London, UK. Does anyone have advice? Can I go on my trip? Will the France government make me quarantine for 14 days?Please give me any advice or feedback you have to offer."

You will not be allowed to board a flight to Europe.
"Hello,my trip to Paris is on the 22nd of August from Germany. We first planned for AMsterdam but rearranged because the situation in Netherlands is more quickly getting worse.Nevertheless I also see the numbers rising more quickly in France than in Germany, but how is it directly in Paris? Are there numbers just for the Paris region?Background is that Germany is now not declaring whole countries to risk areas but often just regions, like Barcelona or Madrid."

"Things change daily and often flip-flop unpredictably, so there's no way of knowing what the situation will be in September."
"It pains me to say this, but please consider moving your plans to sometime in 2021. Coming into the EU from the USA is not an option for us today and is unlikely to be an option next month. You've seen how poorly we in the US have managed COVID-19 and we are unlikely to be welcome in the EU in the near future. Until such time that there is an effective vaccine, I urge you to reschedule your trip and save yourself the anxiety and stress of worrying about a September trip that is unlikely to be allowed. Paris is one of my favorite cities and I visit it at least once each year. It is truly a wonderful place and waiting to visit Paris during a time when things have more fully recovered is, IMHO, the best course of action. Stay safe."
"@ Claire Speake, Perhaps your confusion is caused by the fact that the US State Department has lifted its global Do Not Travel advisory. Unfortunately, the fact that we can now leave the country does not mean that other countries are allowing us to enter other than subject to certain exceptions. On August 7th, the US Embassy in France issued an alert that I am pasting here for you: ""The Department of State has removed the global Level 4 Travel Alert advising United States citizens not to travel internationally. It has reverted to country specific travel alert levels. For France, it has issued a Level 3 Health Advisory, advising U.S. citizens to reconsider travel due to the impact of COVID-19.The following information has been updated on the U.S. Embassy Paris COVID-19 website: Broad restrictions on non-essential travel from many countries outside the European Union, including the United States, remain in place. The French government has defined essential travel as entry by French citizens, residents of France, students, and spouses and children of French citizens.In rare cases, the French government will consider allowing travel in humanitarian situations and reportedly in cases of business activity important to the French economy. Persons may inquire about such allowances with the French Embassy in Washington, DC (visas@consulfrance-washington.org).The United States Embassy has no standing to intervene or advocate for the private travel of United States citizens to France. Please contact your nearest French Embassy or French Consulate or refer to France Visas. If you are already in France, please contact your nearest Prefecture or refer to Ministry of the Interior or Prefecture de Police."" It seems to me that while we cannot tell what will happen in the future, as noted by others as of now unless you fall into one of the exceptions, entry into France from the US is a challenge. Early September is only about two weeks away so I think you should start wrapping your mind around the distinct possibility that this trip is going to be no go. Plus, I read an article this morning that the UK is adding France to its quarantine list.  The only people I know who have traveled to France from the US are a couple made up of a French citizen who lives in the US and his American wife.Edited: 3:02 pm, August 15, 2020 "

I have had the flu and have never experienced this type of misery.What are your concrete suggestions?MrsJAS"
"Euromanic's Post #17 exhibits a particularly iconiclastic view of humankind. What some might see as worryingly callous, E-M sees as simple pragmatism - let people catch Covid-19 and die and leave the world to the survivors. Additionally, there is nothing to be done about it in the present or short term future. I am not sure if that view is particularly European, or whether it is a view based in nihilistic anomie. Whatever the source and motivation, it is a sad circumstance and I trust that E-M finds some joy in Paris - at least in its monuments, galleries and customs, if not in its residents and visitors."
The view is simply scientific.
It's literally not.
"What is the scientific view, then?"
"""Lots of deaths are unpleasant."" That is the callousness. The loss of one life is always one too many. Death is not an unpleasantness, it is a profound tragedy. Those who often suffer most are those who suffer the loss of a relative or dear friend. Due to this scourge, I lost a close and valued friend who I had known and admired for fifty-six years.

"ATFSo I'm a riddle wrapped up in an enigma, what can I tell you.CheersAnthony K"
"Agreed Edefran. EM has been provided with reams of scientific links already. And now - well apparently it's all down to those darn doctors panicking when they see their patients dying. That reminds me of the joke that ""homelessness isn't a problem - it's just a rumour spread by people with nowhere to live"".GRA - an eloquently worded post which will be ignored by EM. His words remind me of another denier when asked about deaths: ""It is what it is"".If EM needs something to do - please get out there (in a mask) and volunteer to help those whose lives have been changed forever by loss or unemployment."
"I'm not fussed about my posts being removed, such is life. However, when the ""community"" and moderators begin removing the posts of a ""destination expert"" then you might question the label.Keep well allAnthony K"
"On this Forum we have the ""pinned"" thread entitled ""Coronavirus : What's the situation ?"" May I suggest using that thread going forward and closing this one, for fear of it becoming shambolic.CheersAnthony K"
"Looks like I missed quite the back-and-forth. To answer Manic’s question, a scientific view is one that results from careful observation, experimentation, and analysis of data. Rinse and repeat as needed. Science is a process not a result. A scientific view certainly doesn’t result from red herrings, straw men, reductios and sticking your head in the sand."
"Then you’ll agree that googling for a few random links and tossing them at someone else is not very scientific. I look at data, read research, think for myself, and draw my own conclusions. Others are content to believe what their preferred demagogues tell them and scarcely think at all. That’s the fundamental difference. Science is not copying and pasting from Google."
"A Paris-related analogy might be instructive. Before I first visited Paris, many people who had never been there and knew only what Grandpa had told them about his postwar visit to Paris tried to tell me about it. Others who had done a two-day tour of Paris tried to convince me they were old hands on the City of Light. Some (many) simply repeated whatever rumors they had heard. I ignored them all and did my own research, which provided a far different and much more accurate picture of what to expect. The trip went very well in consequence. I apply this philosophy to everything, including medicine, a long-standing interest of mine."
"Now we may ask the question whether reading Parismanic's musings about Covid-19 is in the category of demagogic or simply absurd compared to scientific links.<< Some (many) simply repeated whatever rumors they had heard. I ignored them all and did my own research, which provided a far different and much more accurate picture of what to expect. >>This statement would appear to confirm that we can ignore what he says and research elsewhere."
"Claire SpeakeThis thread must be of no value whatsoever to you now. I hope you will close it very, very soon.CheersAnthony K"
Claire has no way of closing this thread. Even if she removes her original post the thread will not close. If you are not interested in this discussion you can just stop reading it. Cheers.
I definitely recommend that everyone do his own research. Nobody should take anyone's word (including mine) for anything. But I know that most people don't like to do their own thinking.
"""Everyone can do his own research"". Oh phew that's a relief. Women can go back to their embroidery and leave the science to the chaps."
"Yes, people should think critically about the information they consume, and, yes, research is more than copy-and-pasting links. But as far as I'm aware, none of us works in a virology or epidemiology lab, so we are left to examine and scrutinise the writings and findings of those who do. How do most of us have access to those writings and findings? A search engine. People are asking you to share your information with them and you refuse, saying « Do your own research ». You've shared your conclusions, but we're not asking for your conclusions. We're asking for your evidence. Since you provide none, your constant refrain of « Do your own research » is to my mind an admission that you do not understand your beliefs well enough to express and explain them accurately and coherently. Pathetic."
If everyone did their own research we wouldn't need Destination Experts.Just an idle thought.Anthony K
"I tell people to do their own their research in order to try to make them think. If they choose not to believe what I say because they prefer to do their own research, or because they did their research and reached different conclusions, that’s great, it reassures me. But they disbelieve me because I’m not their favorite celebrity or because I’m not a member of their treehouse club, that’s bad. And it’s perplexing when someone can be shown established facts and figures, and yet dismiss them. What part of ""0.3% is very low mortality"" is so difficult to understand?"
"I don't care that you're not my favourite celebrity. I don't care that you're not a member of my treehouse club. These statements are both irrelevant, because I don't have a favourite celebrity nor am I a member of a treehouse club. I only care that you, through either ignorance or intentional misdirection, continue to spout nonsense, all the while claiming that you rely on the factual analysis of data. Just as you repeat « Do your own research », you also repeat the 0.3% mortality rate, but you have not once provided a source for it, so I'm inclined to believe you have made it up or are relying on faulty information that you do not wish to divulge. The WHO coronavirus dashboard (https://covid19.who.int/), as of this writing, gives the following figures:- 21,989,366 confirmed cases of COVID-19- 775,893 deathsThe case fatality rate = ( Number of deaths / Number of confirmed cases ) * 100So, (775,893 / 21,989,366) * 100 gives us a case fatality rate of 3.53%. If you would like to present evidence to the contrary, I would be happy to read it.Edited: 4:47 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"If you are referring to infection fatality rate, then yes, obviously the IFR will be less than the CFR. It's much more difficult to calculate, and I've not seen a 0.3% overall IFR cited in the recent academic literature. I like to learn, so would be more than happy to be proven wrong."
"I suggest (again) that, as part of the research you haven’t yet done, you look up the meaning and difference between IFR and CFR. The current WHO and CDC IFR estimates that you haven’t looked up hover around 0.5%-0.6%. I’ve seen other estimates that you’ve not sought out as low as 0.1%, and I find 0.3% most plausible."
"I repeat: You've shared your conclusions, but we're not asking for your conclusions. We're asking for your evidence. Since you provide none, your constant refrain of « Do your own research » is to my mind an admission that you do not understand your beliefs well enough to express and explain them accurately and coherently. Pathetic."
"Do your own research, and you will find evidence. Draw your own conclusions. Do your own math to discover why Covid is not deadly by any stretch of the imagination. I will not do your thinking, or your math, or your research for you. I will only encourage you to try them yourself.Thinking for yourself allows you to avoid being manipulated by others. If being someone else's pawn makes you comfortable, however, that’s your choice. I’ll continue to try to persuade others to do their own thinking."
"I'm not asking you to do my thinking or my maths. I am simply asking you to share your evidence, share your data. Show me your evidence and then I can synthesise, analyse and draw my own conclusions. That's what scientists do. In fact, when scientists don't do that, red flags go up.Trying to engage with you is clearly an absolute waste of time and effort.Edited: 5:27 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"It is not my data or my evidence, it is simply the data and evidence, readily accessible to anyone who cares to look for it. You can therefore look for it directly yourself, which you do not seem to have thus far done. Another advantage to doing as I suggest is that you gain support for and confidence in your opinions, making it trivially easy to defend them should that become necessary or desirable. In consequence there is no need to resort to dubious methods to try to convince others (or yourself) that you are objectively correct."
"Dubious methods like the strawmen, red herrings and general evasiveness that so liberally pepper your nonsense? Please, spare me. You are a master projector."
"Of course it happens all the time that a virus will spread across the entire world in such a small amount of time. Of course it happens all the time that ICUs are over their maximum capacity so rapidlyOf course it happens all the time that morgues can't handled the amount of deceased persons and need refrigerated trucks. It probably has nothing to do with the high R factor of this virus.Imagine what would have happened if there hasn't been any confinment, distanciation and now that we have learn more about that virus the wearing of masks to lower the propagation rate of the virus.Of course it's totally a coincidence that most of the countries that have better cope with the virus are the ones with stricts sanitary directives and where it's out of control is where governement have minimized or denied for a while the seriousity of the virus. Pure coincidence. Because we all know that it will soon disappear just like that...And there are no reason why a majority of doctors, public health officials, virologists or epidemiologists from accross the world are mostly all saying the same things and are taking the same kind of sanitary measures. Probably pure coincidence here as well. Let's not talk about asymptomatic people that can spread the virus without knowing it or that the immunity to the virus is still unknown be that it might be of short term because there as been people that have caught it more than once. So a vaccine that will probably not be 100% efficient like for most virus of this type, might not work for a long period of time as well. No need to be careful about that either.Ok now I think I better wake up now or hop into another dream. I'll leave this nightmare thread behind. Just passing by. Take care ! Stay safe ! :-)"
The epidemic is behaving like most epidemics. It has done so since its beginning. All the numbers bear this out. Only the hysterical overreaction to it is really different. There is no correlation between measures taken and the course of the epidemic.

About one person in 300 who is infected by Covid dies. The rest survive.
"Anthony, how's those thousands of beachgoers doing that you wished would shoot themselves in your crusade?99.7% survivability is bad compared to 99.8%.."
I don't recall wishing that anyone would shoot himself. Where did you see this?How low must mortality be before you stop dwelling upon the dead and begin thinking about the living?
Not you Euro. Anthony. Anthony wished all those thousands of beachgoers to shoot themselves back in early summer while he was planning his non essential travel.
"I think 1 in 300 people dying is quite a lot actually, and that figure is even higher when you consider people of 65 years of age or older, and I'm not OK with that. Also, surviving Covid is not always a walk in the park. Those who make it through intensive care face months of difficult rehab. Some people also seem to have long lasting effects of intense fatigue, shortness of breath or loss of smell/taste, and possible other long-lasting effects we still have no idea about."
"Wuhan, the epicenter of this particular strain of the many Coronaviruses, hasn't had a case since they reopened in May. What about a second wave at the epicenter? Oh that's easy, start typing Wuhan electric dance pool party in Google to find thousands enjoying all of August Wuhan Techno Party 2020. People are suffering but it's not from bat soup."
If I expressed any desire to see people die then it was unintentional and I unreservedly apologise.Covid19 is just one of the things that people have suffered from in 2020. In the UK our Government has used the virus to cull our elderly population. A sickening act perpetrated by an uncaring leadership.Keep well allAnthony K
"Look at the mortality of truly deadly diseases and and 1 in 300 will seem like a gift from above. Of the handful of people I know personally who have actually become sick with Covid and knew it, all recovered without incident after a week or so of feeling crummy. This is very different from watching all your friends and relatives die. People today are spoiled: they've never seen death wipe out everyone they know and love. They think death is exciting rather than tragic. People who have been orphaned by a disease like Ebola or smallpox have a different perspective."
"I cannot believe that the course this thread is now taking is helping Claire make a decision about visiting Paris.Perhaps she might comment, simply as a way of getting things back on topic.CheersAnthony K"
"I'm not going to feel happy or relieved because there are diseases more deadly than Covid. And I'm glad for your friends, but if you think personal experience makes facts then two people I know have been affected with Covid and remained tired or short of breath for weeks (and another one is unfortunately dead)."

"<< the media ""forget"" to mention that ICU cases are very few and not increasing, and there only a handful of deaths. >>Manic, the media report that every day, and it is also in the statistics available to everyone online. Which media are you following that do not report this?"

"Good link Anthony! From it comes the hard truth people are having a hard time digesting. ""Despite the surge in infections, Macron told Paris Match magazine that ""local strategies"" were preferable to another national lockdown, which he said would cause considerable ""collateral damage"""""
It's not about quarantine in London.You were afraid of having to quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Paris.
TesaObviously. Because I was only visiting for a week.CheersAnthony K
"The thing not to forget is that the number of cases is an indication of how the virus is spreading. So it's an important variables to follow and a signal to watch for. It's to avoid completely control of the propagation of the virus. To help people know if they have to take more or less precautions and for the vulnerable persons to be aware. Anyway a lot of people that thought they were not at risk caught it and got quite sick and some of them died. Ok it's not the vast majority, but those cases do happen more than we would have thought at the start of it all. And we have often seen since the beginning of this pandemic that one or two weeks later then you see the ICU admission and the deaths rising. And no one want their health care system to be overflowed again. At least out of respect and consideration for them ! The more it goes and the more we learn about the aftereffects of the virus and that for people that are severely affected by the virus it can take a long long time to get through it and may never completely recover from it.We are still learning about it. It is far from being under control. We don't know yet about immunity so we globaly decided that it was better to be safe than to be sorry. And again... no body wants their health care system to be overflowed again."
"I know that Euromanic is on the spectrum and try to make allowances for that, but saying that Paris has become a police state is absolute delerium. I continue to go to the movies 5 days a week, I have been to the theatre, too. I walk all over the place and take the metro and buses all the time. My mask does not bother me. Even before it was obligatory to wear a mask indoors, I always did it out of respect for the cashiers and salespeople who have to do it 8 hours a day. And we are all staying safe."
"Tesa, well said."
"All this talk about deaths when what the true experts (not delusional arm chair critics) are warning about with this particular virus is the unusual secondary effects which are not at all like the typical strains of the seasonal flu viruses, for which there are vaccines. The maniac is a DE on this forum and is making delusional and dangerous commentary contradictory to majority scientific opinion in a time of world crisis and providing travel advice that demonstrates recklessness. So anyone who feels up to it should write to TA Support and ask that the maniac's DE status be revoked."

"French_Mystique, the notion of a troll is very subjective. If people are so concerned about the proper functioning of these threads why don't they report people who continuously post gratuitous and duplicitous drivel. I agree with the sentiments about Euromaniac 100% but there are very regular posters here just engaging in self-indulgent drivel and nobody reports them. Why is this the case? If people only report Euromaniac and people who set up fake accounts then it is totally hypocritical."
The notion of a troll is not subjective once you can easily recognize the same troll who changes usernames daily and who has been trolling this forum for years and from whom you might frequently have received expletive laced PM's with the full knowledge that yourself and many other forum members have received similar PM's. Trolls are easy to spot when you know what to look for.
"I don't want to speak for F_M, but the way I see it is this: yes, there are regular posters to this forum who write gratuitous and duplicitous drivel, but they don't wear the DE label. At worst, those posters are an annoyance. DEs, for better or worse, rightly or wrongly, carry a perceived sense of authority: they're 'experts', after all! When a DE so recklessly shares deranged misinformation, that threatens the forum, the travellers and the Tripadvisor brand itself. My goal isn't to have anyone booted from the TA forums (except for trolls); I just think that those who peddle disinformation and polemics should not have the DE label affixed to their profiles. As for the patently obvious trolls, like in #90, they're easy enough to identify and ignore."
"Also, I don't report people who post gratuitous or duplicitous drivel nor folks who bicker and insult others. That is just the way internet commentary works. If you can't stand the heat then get out of the kitchen. There was one former forum member who would frequently go out of their way to attack me and I never once reported any of their posts. I've only ever reported trolls and guerilla marketers."
"""current generations have never experienced oppression"". Seriously? Perhaps that depends on the colour of your skin, disabilities, religion, sexuality, politics, income. People all over the world, including Europe, suffer oppression every single day."
