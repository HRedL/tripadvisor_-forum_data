"Will be visiting to take our son to a hockey game, a special thing as he is a hockey player and was told three years ago at 8, that he would never be able to play again when he got a rare bone disease in his hip. We flew him across country for a special surgery and he was able to get back into hockey. But now after hearing the bed bug epidemic, I am scared to go. We were given a hotel,stay at LaGrande residence inn Sutton place and the bed bug registry notes several complaints...kind of freaking ...any advice, suggestions? we can not afford timbering these home and in our car...thanks so much!"
What bedbug epidemic? You should be fine at LaGrande Residence Inn. It's a high end hotel and you should have no worries.You do know the tricks to check for begbugs?
A hotel could have had bed bugs reported last week and now be free of them.
".... Or a room that was clear of them yesterday could now have one. Are the reports on the bedbug registry recent? Unless there are a spate of reports on an ongoing basis, I would assume it to be a one-time occurrence that was dealt with, as is standard within the accommodation industry.High end or low end doesn't really make a difference - any hotel can be affected. Bed bugs are hitch-hikers and easily moved from one place to another on people and their belongings. They can also be found on public transit (buses, trains and planes), movie theatres, public libraries - basically any place where people are and the bugs can hitch a ride and then find somewhere to hide before getting their next meal. So no, there really is no place that is guaranteed ""safe"". (Eek, what a thought! LOL)They are super creepy but I haven't heard anything lately about an ""epidemic"". A few years ago, there was a time when it seemed that we were reading about them in the news all the time but I think the accommodation industry has upped their game in terms of staff training and monitoring for the critters. Similarly, you can educate yourself how to check for them, and a few safeguards you can take to avoid inadvertently taking them home."
"Nei and thank you! It just seemed like there weren't very good reviews for this hotel and was only rated like a 42/96 hotels. The number one hotels the fairmint pacific rim is even cheaper than this one and had tons of better reviews so just trying to figure out if any issues with it. They said it was like an apartment also and not hotel...that confuses me, we don't travel much and just not wanting to risk any bugs lol."
"They had four post, two this last year and two before that....some hotels like the fairmint pacific rim don't have any reports which I know it doesn't mean they haven't had any...I do check hotels when we do have to stay in them, I just am a freak about these and can't not bring them home or have my son bit by any.. Thanks for any advice :-)"
please don't judge a hotel by its 'ranking' on Tripadvisor. Its seldom a matter of its better or worse. Its based on an algorithim and more favorable reports bump a propety way up in the rankings.
"2. What can bed bugs do to me? Are bed bug bites worse for children or the elderly, compared to healthy adults? Can I get a disease from bed bugs?The serious negative effects of bed bugs are more mental than physical, but the itchy bites can’t be ignored either.The mental effects are stress and lack of sleep. (And then there’s delusory parasitosis—meaning the bugs really are gone, but you can’t shake the feeling that they’re still there.) Even if the thought of sleeping with bed bugs doesn’t keep you up at night, the time and money it takes to get rid of them can stress you out.Bed bugs can be a public relations nightmare. You’d hope customers would respect a proactive hotel, motel, or landlord who tried to educate them before a problem came in, but that’s rarely the case. Simply the mention of bed bugs can deter customers.And householders worry what friends, family, and neighbors will say if their problem becomes known. Bed bugs aren’t associated with filth or social status, but many people think they are.Bed bugs aren’t known to transmit disease. And some people don’t even get marks when bit. But scratching bites can lead to a secondary infection. Resist the urge to scratch. People with health problems and children are more at risk for infection because their immune systems are compromised or they can’t stop scratching."
"La Grande Residence is attached to the Sutton Place Hotel and operated by them . It is an all suite facility. You will have daily towel service but I'm not sure if you have maids who come in every day to make beds. You will need to check the services with the hotel.mThe suites are 1 or 2 bedrooms with full kitchens, living rooms, balconies and the Hotel is in a very good location.Sutton Place itself is an excellent hotel"
"Thanks so much! Would you choose the hotel side or the apt side for the nicest, cleanest? Do you think bed bugs are an issue at all like the few reports? Thanks so much!"
"I don't think bed bugs will be an issue at all. However, it is important to keep an 8 year old safe from them. La Grande/Sutton Place will absolutely respond quickly if there are any bedbugs in the hotel. But I am confident that a hotel of that calibre has quality housekeeping staff who do their jobs well.Here are some tips for looking for bedbugs upon arrival:http://www.wikihow.com/Check-for-Bedbugs"
Thanks so much! We are booked on the apartment side...do you know if the 2 bedrooms are nice or would we be enter in the hotel side? Thanks so much
Guests who have stayed there have written reviews of their stay.La Grande Residence at the Sutton Place: tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154943-d559474…Sutton Place Hotel: tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154943-d155846…
The apartments are very nice and give you the option of a full kitchen if you want to do some of your own meals. There's a grocery store right across the street from the Sutton. It partly depends on the length of your stay. With a 2 bedroom your son will probably have his own tv which I can see being a nice holiday treatEdited: 4 years ago 
Relax...Sutton is a premier stay. Either side. See it on YouTube. Wait till you guys see the pool area.
