and still be Vegas ?
"Still be Vegas? What's that mean, ya Vegas will still be there forever , even long after both of us are gone. Vegas means different things to people.  So yes 6ft social distance is possible, why isn't it for you?"
"It is not possible ...there will be huge changes to Vegas...even every other slot machine violates the 6 foot spacing..How do you partake in table games? Even if you reduce the players to maintain 6 ft spacing, are you cleaning dice after every other roll? Who wants to touch the chips? Only time will tell, but the whole concept of 6 ft spacing will never work."
"A floor plan can be schemed for 6' distancing without mask wearing, and reduced distancing if everyone is made to wear a mask.Elevators would require mask wearing.A one-way system on the casino floor would help, or widen the walkways for people walking in both directions."
"I assume When you say “Vegas” that you mean the Strip and hotels, and not the city that 2 million people call home?  When “Vegas” the city reopens it will a be completely different deal than the Strip reopening."
"""A one-way system on the casino floor would help""That would be the end for me. Some of the casinos are confusing enough. I'd be lost forever! lol"
"People keep talking here about June, July or August. I really don't see how places like casino resorts open this year. And ""normal"" will not occur until a vaccine is found, tested and approved."
"Some here are very desperate to go to LV regardless of what will be LV Strip Light. If the Strip is not near full-strength, it will be quite boring."
"In the short term, Las Vegas will have to adapt to social distancing measures if it wants to reopen. This is the reality at virtually every restaurant, hotel and bar around the world, and will probably continue to some extent until a vaccine is found. Will it feel the same as it was three months ago? No, but neither will Disney World, Hawaii or any other popular tourist destination. It's a new reality for everyone. Those businesses that don't learn to adapt will die."
How can they get people to walk 6' from each other on the Strip...esp where some parts get narrow. How about the crosswalks... how can you control everyone crossing? And what about the pools! How can anyone go in a pool with this virus around? You can't! We just need a vaccine... not just so we can go back to Vegas... but for the entire world's sake. I can't see how they can reopen with social distancing. It just wouldn't feel like Vegas!
I've basically resigned myself to the fact that my summer vacation won't be in Vegas this year. Biloxi has casinos and the governor there seems to want to get back to business. Never thought I'd want to vacation in Mississippi.
maybe Biloxi will figure out how to open their casinos with the 6' social distancing requirements ?
"""If the Strip is not near full-strength, it will be quite boring.""I could do it but I'm kind of a boring person. I go to Vegas 3 - 4 times/year (mostly solo), so I spend the majority of time in my hotel (Wynn usually). Days by the pool, nights at the slots...with a daily walk down Strip to watch the fountains/walk through the conservatory (it's my thing). Obviously I'm in the minority but I could do a couple trips to a half-a$$ Vegas...WITH social distancing. They'd have to limit the number of people into the casinos but I'd be ok with that (only registered guests allowed in would limit those numbers). I'd give THIS Vegas a go IF it means hotels would open up and people could get back to work. The only way I wouldn't go back to Vegas, is if masks are mandatory."
"Yea, did you see how the social distancing rules were followed on the California Beaches yesterday ? Packed in like sardines and very few wearing masks. You really are not going to be able to fix STUPID ! If they open as Vegas, the tourists will blow off social distancing rules. They might put slots 6 feet apart but that won't keep most people 6 feet apart."
"Let's be real, it is impossible to do 6 feet. They'll be signs for it, maybe machines being shut off, but that I can deal with. Not putting up with masks, enforced temperature checks, etc. Hoping by August 6 feet will be down to 6 inches."
"""Even if you reduce the players to maintain 6 ft spacing, are you cleaning dice after every other roll? Who wants to touch the chips?""When you're at the table, don't touch your face, mouth, nose or eyes...and when you leave the table, go wash your hands. What do you do when they go to a grocery store...or bank machine...or gas pump...or liquor store? Don't touch your face when you're out and about AND wash you hands when you get home...it's really just that simple."
"There won't be any ""tables"" only will be slots spaced 6 feet apart and no drink service. They make most of their gambling revenue off of slots and don't have to pay for dealers and pit bosses. Will be pretty much just like Slots-A-Fun but cleaner …..maybe."
"Darmom, a very simplistic answer on your part..When you're at the table, don't touch your face, mouth, nose or eyes...and when you leave the table, go wash your hands.I have watched numerous political and medical people say just as you did, and nearly everyone had touched something on their face as they gave your advice."
"People touch their faces unconsciously. That is one of the reasons why gloves and masks simply don't work unless you are almost entirely focused on one task, like drawing blood for instance. Once the task is done you remove the PPE. It simply isn't made for long term wear."
""" I have watched numerous political and medical people say just as you did, and nearly everyone had touched something on their face as they gave your advice.""Well that's on them. People need to be responsible for there own health and well-being and that starts with good handwashing...the first line of defense against germs and the spread of infection."
"Can’t speak to women’s restroom, but can tell you many leave the men’s restroom without washing...so to think they would do so after a crap game is highly unlikely"

It can re-open but it won’t be worth a damn til all restrictions are lifted
"As I said in the other thread, I'd go to ""Vegas Lite,"" but only because I've already been to Vegas a lot and because I'll be able to go pretty cheaply, between airline credits and comped/cheap rooms. I wouldn't want to pay full price for a half-price experience, and I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who has never been to Vegas before, either.If you think about it -- aside from table games -- Vegas is better-equipped to accommodate social distancing than most businesses, due to sheer size alone.As for Biloxi...now it's getting tempting to take a trip down there. Beau Rivage is a nice place. We have visited a few times on the way to/from New Orleans but have never actually stayed there."
"I'm not sure when casinos in Biloxi and other places are opening, but I would assume before Vegas and probably with less restrictions. I'm also considering Deadwood South Dakota, Harrah's Ak-Chin in Arizona and a few others. Basically wherever I can sit down at a bar, restaurant or slot machine without a freedom burka on my face, can gamble, and can sit in a pool. Ideally it would be a Caesars or MGM owned property so I can use status, get tier credits, but I'm willing to sacrifice that if need be. Beau Rivage is originally what Steve Wynn wanted to call Bellagio. You can see a lot of the Bellagio look in the resort mixed with some touches from Mandalay Bay's latest renovation when it comes to the suites."
"Some of you people are delusional....and most of you would still be standing in England on D Day. Why wait for a vaccine? Only 38% of adults get the flue vaccine Why do expect this to be any different, especially since it will be new. I won't be getting it but then again, I'm not afraid of COVID either. It's a virus like all the rest and in the end, will have a fatality rate of less than 1% in otherwise healthy people. The government of Sweden is the only country that seems to remember how viruses are handled. There will always be risks...and deaths involved but all we're doing is prolonging the virus spread by staying quarantined. Or at least you are because I'm outside every day enjoying life....with NO MASK. You know the masks that 98% of people are wearing that studies have shown have effectiveness levels of as low as 2%. yeah, they'll save you."
so when you are out enjoying life are you practicing social distancing ?
#24 reference #9 as she makes a valid point about walking on the strip : How about the crosswalks... how can you control everyone crossing. Point being even the simplest thing can be major obstacles .
"@MikeSurgical masks are up to 56% effective when worn correctly. They never are. Guaranteed out of 100,000 people, 99,000 people will be wearing them wrong making them effectively useless. Scarves are 2% effective. Just think of the build up on those, yuck."
"I guess jaywalking will now be encouraged! I really hope the casinos are not reopened as slot arcades. Even if they have to close every other table game, it doesn't feel like a casino to me if I don't hear the roars from a hot craps table, or the table pounding and cursing of a blackjack table where a dealer just made a 5 card 21 to wipe out the whole table. The only thing I suppose that might make social distancing 6 feet work in Vegas more than, say the beaches of CA and FL, is the presence of the security guards in the casinos. There, at least, they can encourage casinogoers to space out. But not sure it wouldn't feel like Big Brother is watching over you."
"Honestly, keep everything closed until things are relatively normal. Visiting Vegas and following all those rules is not my beloved Vegas."
"Big Brother is always watching you when you're in a casino.I absolutely refuse to wear a mask, scarf or anything else on my face. That's true for Vegas or anywhere."
Sunglasses.
Touche!

"People who are unwilling to wear masks either don't understand what they are supposed to do, or are extremely selfish and have no concern for others.

There will be people in the casino who just don't care, especially if they've had a losing streak.It's bad enough in supermarkets where people should be focused and alert, yet I always find that even the staff get tired of social distancing."

I can’t see these large corporations get all the employees back in hoping people come. It’s just my opinion but with Venetian closed until June I suspect they keep moving it. What if all the independently owned restaurants and shops won’t or are not able to open. I’m not going to a casino and hotel with no other amenities or restaurants. My opinion of course.

"""Honestly, keep everything closed until things are relatively normal. Visiting Vegas and following all those rules is not my beloved Vegas.""Businesses will need to open before we find a vaccine. It's unrealistic to expect the economy to remain closed until then. And the only realistic way to reopen soon is to have these restrictions in place."
Maybe it was the Clorox chaser in my cleanball.
“ Maybe time for casinos to go non-smoking? It might be a good time for it. Just a thought.”Not a bad thought. But I wonder if the casinos will want to alienate any portion of their customers while they’re trying to get back on their feet.
"#57...didn't see any mention of social distancing in the casino......specific to at least 6' rule at the table games.Edited: 9:56 pm, April 27, 2020 "
but they put lots of time and effort into plan.it might work with some necessary tweaks....trial and error would be necessary.
"I realize all the stuff below is obvious, but sometimes the cumulative facts ( as we currently know them) sometimes get lost in the TA thread back and forth conversations. The Vegas casinos ( along with their employees) have to reopen soon in order for them to financially survive. In order for them to reopen under the current conditions they will have to abide by a set of mandates that prioritize Covid health safety guidelines (whether they or the patrons like it or not). They don't really want to operate under those conditions / restrictions ( just like most potential patrons)..but they'll have no choice. Some unknown but significant proportion of potential visitors will still be afraid of Covid infection; the resorts have to present conditions and operations that somewhat allay that fear ( even if it's just a facade / front in some minor ways). They have to present a condition that makes things at least appear safe within their walls ( in spite of the multiple annoyances associated with that). There'll be no choice for visitors but to deal with the annoyances ( other than to not show up at all...that's the alternative).Annoyances will include temp screening at restricted property entry doors, lowered occupancy (I've heard 25% hotel occupancy..don't know if that's a certainty), elevator capacity limited to 4 at a time, masks worn by all employees and handed out at the door for guests (at least at Wynn, if the Gov. allows it), abundant hand sanitizer kiosks , social distancing at 6 feet including table games and slots, abundant signage everywhere reminding us why they're doing all these things; very periodic cleaning of slot machines, table game components, and multiple property areas by staff; there are other annoyances, if that's not enough. One possible additional aggravation that's been floated around is limiting property/ casino use to registered hotel guests only...ohh joy.I'll speculate that it'll be a nightmare for both casino staff and any visitors to comply with these early restrictions..it's so anti-Vegas in so many ways. But for those who go at or soon after reopening, they'll have to just deal with it. I'll just add I'm glad to see them reopen ( for financial survival reasons); at the same time, the priority remains the application of these health safety mandates that both sides will often complain about.Cheers..."
"@nuzzja : (a) Everyothertableopen(b) Three chair/guest maximum per table game (corners and middle seat remain)While not necessarily 6 feet apart, I think it could work, What they did not mention, is for the casino floor, if there will still be cocktail service.There will be for table games upon request.Again while I think it is absolutely n necessary to take all and every detailed precaution , I just don't find it worth going. I'd rather wait while things get figured out and things get to a new normal ... Inhaling your own carbon dioxide for hours while playing is not that healthy. Its just my opinion, to me its a fun place and I enjoy it when I go, but to me Vegas is Non Essential and I'd rather implement those types of safety changes say, like in Paris France or on the streets of Budapest . But I know you're all die hard vegas peeps.My 87 year old mom is so anxious to go back .... Here's the website for their new safety rules and procedures... It's 23 pages long and extensive.

"""... trial and error will be necessary."" And perhaps cause death.To the person who said they have to open soon because of their financial situation. It will not be money that determines when these casinos open, but when it's safe. And that's not happening soon. Not without mass availability of testing. The one we were told 6 weeks ago was ""available to anyone who wanted it.""Edited: 10:33 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"""7. Must wear masks in public""Well...it doesn't look like I'll be staying at Wynn after they open. I have reservations for June, July and the end of August (yes, I'm trying to be optimistic FLWFan) but I won't stay there if masks are mandatory. Hopefully the Bellagio won't have THAT rule."
"I may be way off here, but as an owner wouldn’t it be better just to stay closed then to re-open under these conditions? They will have to employ full staff if they’re doing all these extra cleaning procedures, and what will they have for customers? Maybe 10% of what they are used to? I don’t think it will work. Just my 2 cents"
"They won’t employ full staff, probably 25% staff with 10% occupancy. Even if not profitable it will lower their negative cash flow with fixed expenses. Additionally the will be able to work out the kinks with new protocols. Most people will want to go where they have the protocols already tested. Also the will be getting some people back to work. There probably be economic incentives from both federal and state to get people back to work."
"@FLW...The Nevada Governor will define "" soon"" and ""safe""..and all indications from his PC's and press releases suggest he'll be focused on ""safe"" ( as we'd expect); in the real world outside public statements, he's surely hearing about and considering the financial fallout from this pandemic in his state, even though we might not read about it relative to any verbalized safety concerns. Maddox and Hornbuckle are probably reminding him of the financial numbers at every opportunity; it appears the resorts are willing to comply with any / all safety measures to get some customers on their properties...and begin to generate some revenue for their own and their employee survival.I'm a proponent of the dual approach ( reopening and applying the restrictions)...just my opinion and not forcing it on you or anyone else. Somewhat hypocritically, I don't want to go to Vegas under those conditions. At the same time, the resorts and their 200,000 + or so employees in Vegas are facing economic ruin ( as are others nationwide) if they don't find a way to tip-toe into this. I do agree..these safety mandates are necessary and should remain the priority..but while they open up. Re; the testing thing, I don't know what the current state of rapid, on-site testing options are, and one can't get a truly factual readout on that from most available sources; I've read that the Abbot test takes 5 - 15 minutes to get an accurate (how accurate?) result for simple positive or negative Covid results. Implementing such a testing scenario for guests at entry could add to the list of restrictions at resort entry spots...potential resort visitors are not going to like that either; I don't know if such a scenario could be in place by the time the resorts actually reopen; if it is and Sisolak requires it, then add that to the list of restrictions visitors / guests will have to comply with."
Chuck well said...
"I honestly think, when we're talking about things like trips to casinos on the Vegas Strip, that none of this is going to matter, as far as the public opinion goes.People are either scared of ""this thing,"" or they aren't. The people who are truly frightened of COVID19 might not be able to avoid going to a grocery store or something, but they aren't going to hop on a plane and head to a Vegas casino right now....no matter what precautions the casinos take.The people who are itching to go to Vegas aren't particularly scared of COVID19. Many, if anything, will be annoyed by the social distancing measures taken in the casinos.Same thing with the backlash about Mayor Goodman's comments. I've read that a lot of people are concerned that her comments will cause people to be nervous about returning to Vegas. I don't know about all of that. I think the people who want to visit Vegas in the near future agree with her, at least somewhat, about reopening everything. (Maybe not about her strange science experiment comments). The people who are truly horrified by her comments (rather than being mildly amused or confused) are people who already have a strong opinion that Vegas casinos should remain closed.Now, will the social distancing measures help encourage Sisolak to allow re-opening? Maybe. I think that's what the casinos are concerned about. Still, it doesn't look like Sisolak is going to budge on that anytime soon."
