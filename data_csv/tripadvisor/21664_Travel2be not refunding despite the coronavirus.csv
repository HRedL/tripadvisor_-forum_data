"Have a trip planned for Italy, Milan, in the yellow zone of risk for the coronavirus on March 5, 2020zContracted the agency to cancel the trip and have a refund but despite the situation they refuse to give me the refund.My understanding is that if you are flying in a red or yellow zone you can ask for a refund.Any experience?"
"Not sure where your understanding comes from but you need to read through your contract. What does it state about refunds? Right now, according to the CDC Milan and Rome are safe to travel to but they advise against it unless it's necessary. Since neither city have been deemed to be off limits I can't see the tour company issuing refunds if it's not in their contract.Again, read through the contract. If you are within the time frame for getting a refund then you should request one. If not, see if they will be willing to change the dates to later this year or to give you a credit for a future trip.Donna"
"depends on what is your country of origin...for US Milan is Level 4 and that is no travel....US airlines are not flying there directly from US. OP mentions ""agency"" and usually you will have much better leverage if dealing directly with airlines and hotels etc. Suggest this poster look at the other threads about refunds and if possible file a dispute with cc company."
A cc dispute should be the last resort. The OP needs to see what the terms and conditions are and go from there. They should also contact the companies involved to see if they can work out other arrangements such as travel at a later date. Depending on where the OP is traveling from there may be no issue. If the country hasn't issued any restrictions on travel they may have no recourse. I would contact the companies directly to help solve this.Donna
"Thank you for all your feedbacks.I completely agree that in normal condition, the standard rules and regulations should apply but, unfortunately, this is an unpredictable situation.As of today, Milan in part on the “red zone”, so no travel in or out the entire region of Lombardia is allowed to prevent further sites of the virus.I didn’t travel as I was afraid something like this could have occurred. This is an unexpected, extreme situation, thus I would expect a more responsible action from Travel2be. Accepting the money for the reservation and not caring about supporting the customers in this situation is a very unprofessional behavior."
It isn't a question of not caring - you booked with them subject to booking terms & conditions. The coronavirus isn't their fault either. If travel hasn't been banned but you choose to not go then that is your choice and you pay the price unless insurance will cover it (unlikely if travel hasn't been banned and possibly subject to restrictions).
one of the unfortunate results of not just booking direct with airlines and hotels.
You are completely right and I learned my lesson.I’m just amazed by the incompetence and irresponsibility of Travel2be.....
How are they being incompetent or irresponsible? They are following the contract you agreed to. This is a bad situation for everyone. At the time you cancelled your trip the area wasn't under a no travel ban. I understand your concerns about travel but you were under a contract. Perhaps contact them to see if they would be willing to switch your dates. They may do this if you try to work with them. Donna
"Maybe Travel2be will be willing to work w/ you on alternate travel dates. But if your departure date was March 5th, it may be that there is nothing they can do for you any longer. If this is a travel agency, they will have already dispensed your funds and have little control over the situation. Yet you are expecting them to make you whole out of their own pockets? It is not very realistic.Sorry this happened to you, though."
Travel2be sucks.Will never book any tickets at this website.Customer service is very difficult to get in touch and no positive feedback for this terrible virus outbreak!!
">>Customer service is very difficult to get in touch and no positive feedback for this terrible virus outbreak!!<<Be reasonable. These are not normal times, and every travel-related call centre is in meltdown.Right now, it does not matter whether you are trying to contact a full-service airline or a crappy outfit like Travel2Be. All of them are overloaded and unable to cope."
"Joanne, the entire country is under lock down. If people leave their homes they are subject to fines so it's very possible the employees cannot get to work in order to process your refund. Goodness, give them a break and wait a while. They will get to it as soon as they can. For right now, it's all about containing the outbreak, NOT about making refunds to people halfway around the world.Put thing in perspective.Donna"

"Thanks Donna. I can understand but to all other replies: I don’t know if you guys really ever got any response ever before, however we here in Asia never got any since Jan.That was earlier than serious outbreak in Europe.Our trip is not bound to Italy, but to Tokyo.The only reason I replied this post was just want let Serena know that we face the same problem, she is not alone.As other discussion in Asia’s or Taiwan’s travelers forum, we found the service attitude is negative all the time.Not just under nowadays situation. If they can send a official notice mail and let customers know they will try to respond even in slow progress instead of doing nothing. Maybe all of you are rich and very congenital so that you can stand the way they did, but I’m sorry I’m not!"

"I am in a similar situation.... we booked a trip with The National Trust tours to Milan and Lake Como...Gohagan Travel in Chicago is the agency....leaving May 30th from the US. It is cancelled but they are saying it’s merely postponed to two other dates in September or October . We cannot Travel those dates nor feel safe to do so. They sent one email saying if the trip was cancelled we would get a. Full refund, but they keep,saying it’s just postponed. They are offering a voucher good for a year or the same trip next year. We were promised a refund..... cannot reach a person directly. Get voice mail,as,they are working remotely in Chicago froM home. The only person who has returned my call is the air,one booker who has advised us to wait until,Delta cancels,the flight. Sooo frustrating!!!"

"sueajp:I think your post would have been better as a new thread. It had nothing to do with Travel2be. Future travelers who may be looking for information about the National Trust / Gohagan Travel tour companies might have difficulty locating your post because it is posted under the Travel2be title of this thread. Regarding the response from the travel agencies, I think you need to give them a bit of a break. These are not normal times. Any traveler who had plans to travel within the next 6 months is probably trying to cancel or reschedule. In some cases, the travel agent might have to contact airlines, hotels, etc and they might encounter long hold times themselves.I personally wouldn't try to reschedule or cancel until closer to the date of travel. Most of the cancellation / refunds policies have been incremental. The travel agency might be waiting on an updated refund policy from another business before refunding you. Just keep an eye on their website for any updates or any new messages via email. Many cancellation policies from travel businesses have been continually evolving."
"Hi. As far as I know, in Europe you are entitled to receive the amount of the plain tickets. I don't know about accommodation, etc. In normal conditions, airlines are forced to compensate passengers for cancellations; these aren't normal conditions, so they don't have to give you anything extra, but at least the amount you paid for the tickets *taxes included -as far as I know. There is a website at the European Commission where you can write and official complaint, and where there is plenty of information."
Just as an update... Delta and KLM did refund our flights fully.
Travel2be services are shockingly terrible. No professionalism and a serious lack of transparency
"Temba, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"Hi. I’ve also booked in February a roundtrip flight with travel2be for April-May, eventually it was canceled. I’ve contacted them via email, since by phone it’s impossible to reach them. It’s already been more than two months since I wrote them, still no answer or refund."
"Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Sergiu, Travel2Be/Travelgenio must have around 150 threads at least about them on the Air Travel forum. No one can each them, and the advice is to contact your card provider rather than wasting time trying to deal with them yourself."
"I'm always are wondering, why every people think writing a complaint in a forum would get a solution. Why don't they try to get the money back via cash back of the credit card bank. Its the easiest way."
"It’s for other people to know, to choose wisely their travel/flight agency, before trusting them with their money."
"So they sent me an email with a link to my trip on their website, there are some funny options like online check in, change my booking, cancel my booking, it’s funny because it has already been cancelled, and no option for a refund. So it seems like I should cancel my already canceled booking, so they can charge a cancellation fee? If that’s how they do business, everybody shouldn’t come near this company."
">>so they can charge a cancellation fee<<Their staff have to work to process the refund, the staff have to be paid, so there is a fee. Most online ticket sellers have this fee. You agreed to it when you accepted the T&C."
"That’s in case I’m canceling it, yeah no problem, but if the agency or the flight company does it, why should I pay for it? It’s like if you order a car, pay for it, then the dealer tells sorry we don’t have it any more, but no worries we will refund you 90%."
"No matter who made the cancellation, their staff have to work to process the refund, the staff have to be paid, so there is a fee. Most online ticket sellers have this fee. You agreed to it when you accepted the T&C. That is how all the ""cheap"" online ticket sellers work."
"Sergiu you can check the terms and conditions accepted during the booking process in the general conditions section of our site where you can find the service fees. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents.Edited: 1:12 am, July 03, 2020 "
"The airline cancels flights not an agency. The agent is entitled charge as per the terms of the contract between you and them.If you believe the terms have been breached, you can challenge them. Otherwise, you have to pay them. It's that simple. Don't want to pay agent fees? That's simple too. Don't book through agents. As dreadful as this company is, they are not alone in having fees."
