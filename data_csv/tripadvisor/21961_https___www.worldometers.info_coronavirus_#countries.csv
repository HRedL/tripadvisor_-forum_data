Yes this has been my go to web site since the very start of the pandemic
"Mine too - first thing in the morning, during the afternoon and then before bed!"
Its pretty accurate too
"Mine too.Shocking seeing the number of cases and deaths reported for Mexico on a daily basis., although their deaths/1M pop is still lower than the UK."
"I think the problem with the UK is that any one who has had a COVID test and tested positive and then dies, of whatever, is recorded as a COVID death.....which hasn’t helped our figures"
"MG100, the figure has now been revised downwards by about 5000, on 12th August:Updates1,009 new cases and 20 new deaths in the United Kingdom. England has removed 5,377 deaths from its time series.fNOTE from the UK Government):""On 17 July, the Secretary of State asked Public Health England (PHE) to urgently review the way daily death statistics are currently reported.A review into the method used to calculate these figures considered a range of scientific evidence to identify the best time limit to apply between date of test and date of death.The new daily measure provides a UK-wide count of deaths under a consistent methodology for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales that has been endorsed by an external review.The measure will be based on a 28-day limit between the date of a positive lab-confirmed test and date of death. Deaths that occur more than 28 days after a positive test will not be included in the headline count."" [source]"
Thanks for that Steve :-)
