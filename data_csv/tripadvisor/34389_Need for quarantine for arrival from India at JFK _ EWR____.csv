HiWe are Indian citizens planning to arrive at JFK / EWR on a flight from Mumbai. The flight may be non stop (United) or one stop (LH via FRA or BA via LHR).I am trying to find out whether there is a 14 day quarantine need for travelers from India? This seems to be required for travelers from Schengen / China..... but India is not on the list.Travel is mid Sept --- pl also advise the correct website to check this ever changing criteria. I tried cdc.gov but was unable to find the answers........https:/…aviation-safety.htmlThanks in advance...

"What is your final US destination?Would your flight connections keep you within the airport transit zones or involve time in those countries?You might see if you can find a clearer answers herehttps:/…from-other-countries.htmlhttps:/…covid-19-information.htmlhttps:/…The link you posted is for the agency that operates the NY/NJ airports - individual state rules differ but AFAIK apply to domestic interstate travel.I'd also browse/post in the Air Travel forumGood luck figuring it outEdited: 8:48 am, August 19, 2020 "
"Kaye - we will be in NY/NJ area only for the 5 weeks we plan to be in the US. Also, we may end up taking the non stop flight option - so no transit in the Schengen countries...."
I dunno. According to this article it doesn't look like India is doing very well with COVID. At the current rate there is talk that India could end up with higher numbers than even Brazil. Would not surprise me if the US bans travel from India for non-Americans in the coming weeks. https:/…
"***I dunno.***Great answer and while our governors have instituted a travel advisory for around 35 states as of today, what about people from overseas like the author of this thread? Have the three governors not thought about that? If people from all the high infection rate states can't come here without quarantining, why would they allow people from other countries here without having to quarantine?"
"I'm not sure that states have the power, since the federal government controls immigration into the US. The bigger question is why the federal government isn't stopping this."
"There is a MANDATORY 14-day quarantine requirement for anyone entering New York from outside the state.Please do NOT come here if you cannot abide by this requirement,"
What #7 is just not true. It does not apply to everyone entering from outside the state. It applies to people who have been in the designated states/territories in the prior two weeks. People can see official information from the New York state website below.https:/…covid-19-travel-advisory
"Yes, this seems like a federal issue, not a state one."
Instead of checking the CDC website you should be checking website of US Embassy India -- in.usembassy.gov -- or maybe US immigration service -- uscis.gov.What kind of visa are you traveling on? Depending on what type of visa you have -- or hope to get -- you ought to be able to figure out your situation on the embassy website.
"I linked the CDC, State department travel info site and US Embassy in India above.Edited: 6:30 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"I am in the same situation, I booked United Airlines DEL - EWR on a return journey (after a week of the outbound flight) but I am not sure if there is quarantine or not which is bothering me very much"
"Also you can’t take transit flights. I have checked up with LH, KLM and BA and they have said they do not permit B1/B2 or other non residential visa holders on the flights out of India. (This can change in the coming days so you might wait till the end of the month before booking)So your only option is United or Air India, i would choose United just because you know how people feel about AI lol"
"S.J. - yes... United seems to be the only option at the time. I read this on one of the websites:""""""""Passengers who have transited or have travelled to the following countries in the last 14 days are not allowed to enter the USA: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China (People's Rep.), Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or in the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe). """"""""So the normal flights with Europe / UK transit are out....but my travel is 1st/2nd week of Oct..... so let us see how all this pans out..............."
"My flight is in 8 days, I will post an update on this after. yeah let’s just see how things pans out.Though on another note, my friend from Singapore who has a F1 visa arrived at San Francisco and he wasn’t served with any quarantine. It was like usual. As for booking the flight, it is better you book direct flights nonetheless (just avoid Air India though, never fly them above 7 hours), your risk of facing issues are minimal and upon that, you are less likely to get infected.Edited: 9:42 am, August 24, 2020 "
"This also came up in another thread. The CDC just recently dropped the mandatory quarantine requirement for those traveling to the US from another country. (I actually didn't know there was a mandate until I saw this news release). However, they still recommend quarantining for 14 days from a highly infected Covid area like India. It actually bothers me that the US is even allowing incoming flights from India right now, since the infection rate is so high there. Please note this news release has nothing to do with the local Governors' quarantine rule from other highly infected states.Edited: 2:31 pm, August 24, 2020 "
""". It actually bothers me that the US is even allowing incoming flights from India right now, since the infection rate is so high there."" totally agree."
"***The CDC just recently dropped the mandatory quarantine requirement for those traveling to the US from another country. ***So no mandatory quarantine for people from outside the country, but if you come to NY from any of the states on the quarantine list, you have to quarantine."
"The CDC currently includes India as high risk and suggests only essential travel. Consequently, when folks arrive in NYC from India, they would need to quarantine for 14 days.CH"
Does the NY/NJ/CT travel advisory include foreign countries? I thought it was just for states.
Think only states. Pretty sure international border crossing is exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government and i guess they are fine with this.
"Hi SA and Red, we believe the CDC guidance includes US states as well as other countries. Here is more information:https:/…after-travel-precautions.htmlCH"
"Thanks CH, but the state travel advisories do not mention other countries, only states."
"Thanks SA, but there is a complication here, especially since we are dealing with a pandemic. The supremacy clause, which is part of Article VI of the US Constitution says that if a federal and state law [regulation] contradict, then when you're in the state you can follow the state law, but the fed can decide to stop you. Given that we are dealing with COVID-19 and people's lives and health, we would err on the side of quarantine for 14 days.CH"
S.J. - post #15 .... thanks..... please do post your experience... my travel is still early Oct... so 6-7 weeks away - but need to book tickets in Sept some time.....
"The reason US is still operating flights with India is because they aren’t technically scheduled flights and only a single US airline is allowed to operate which is United, with one flight in total daily to BOM and DEL each.India haven’t yet officially opened up international travel, they are still technically closed. It is operating “repatriation” flights and limited flights with few countries with whom the country has travel bubbles. Upon that, those Bubble flights are limited to very specific categories of people, either residence or citizens or so on. Besides that, India is about to make testing (under 72 hours) important for outbound international pax from next week after the country was blocked from operating flights to HK for two weeks after an incident where 11 pax from a single flight was found to be positive, so to mitigate such blockage from happening again, it is being mulled.I think the various guideline and situation above makes pax from India not that much of a risk compared to even domestic pax in USA where quarantine almost do not exist"
The CDC has dropped it's 14 day quarantine recommendation for travelers:https:/…
Specifically coming from India the CDC is still recommending people stay home as much as possible during the first 14 days after arrival.https:/…coronavirus-india
"Hi! I’m in the same situation to know if I need to do an obligatory quarantine. I’m from CR and plan to traveling to EWR. It’s a Lvl 3 High Risk as India and the 80% of the rest of the world according to the websites. But I want to know is the same, for travelers, outside the country, the quarantine is recommended or mandatory, cause I can follow or unfollow a recommendation, if it’s mandatory, there is nothing I can’t do that isn’t against the law. Thanks for the post and answers"
"I take a look at this page that an airline recommend me to check and here says that the quarantine is just a recommendation, not mandatory, https:/…The real question is if the state regulations apply to International travelers, outside of the country."
"No, the state requirement only applies to domestic travelers. The hope is obviously that people traveling internationally - to the extent travel from their point of origin is permitted - will use caution & good sense (masks, social distancing, etc.)."
"#30 - The link you posted says: ""Recommended quarantine. Travelers are strongly advised to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.""HOWEVER you should read through this thread *and* check the US Federal and state government links included instead of relying on a third party.My current understanding is that for international travelers who are presently permitted to travel here there is a Federal recommendation but not a mandate to quarantine. Anyone considering travel here should also determine if there are any quarantine requirements for any subsequent destinations or their return home. For anyone doing interstate travel they fall under state rules and some do have mandates, including fines/penalties, depending on where people travel to/from. Anyone planning any interstate travel should check out the state government websites of their destinations to determine what requirements, if any, there are. The individual states do not have jurisdiction over international travel.Edited: 7:36 am, August 28, 2020 "
"I call the following number that is a NYC COVID-19 Hotline and ask about my scenario (Costa Rica to New York) and yours (India to New York! They say is only strongly recommended. I establish that this means that I can do it if I want to or not and they tell me that it's true. Obviously get the right measures of social distance, using the mask and all of those, but the quarantine is up to you.This is the number if you want to call also: 18883643065Edited: 12:13 pm, August 28, 2020 "
Yes you should cuarantine Luis. The world should view the US now as a basically inept nonexistent country in terms of laws and regulations. Do the best you can for your health and the public. Cuarantine and mask. The US is simply not anymore a first world country so treat it like you would CR or Nicaragua - protect self and family. https://covid19.who.int/…
"We have had 10 cases of Covid-19 arrive in Guadlajara since March, 10 people who should not have travelled. No, they were not Mexican-Americans, they were American tourists. They should not have travelled. So our health care workers here are swamped already. Tourists call the closed consulate who call people like me for translation services and help. I am an individual bilingual and bicultural but not a health care worker, how do I know what to do. I got a post on this site this week from a guy in Miami wanting to travel here, he refused to take no for an answer. We are fed up with irresponsibility."
"***Sheer nonsense.***Well said ter1413. ***The US is simply not anymore a first world country so treat it like you would CR or Nicaragua - protect self and family.***The US is the greatest country. People want to come to this country, it's still the land of opportunity, don't forget that."
