You should take precautions. The actual risk will vary depending on where in the archipelago you will be travelling to.
I will be in Bohol and El nido...Do you know if These areas are in the risk zone?
"there have been 600 plus deaths plus 14000 plus reported cases and its nationwide and no doubt other SE countries will also be affectedMost who suffer are babies, children and the elderly and frail .You have an advantage ( I assume you are fit to travel )1- better nutrition and ability to fight off illness2-likely to stay in room with mesh guards but watch out as mozzies can get through small holes . You should also invest in a plug in zapper, these are widely available here but watch out for brownouts.3--you can also afford Off or other mozzie repellants4-You can choose not to stay near stagnant water nor do you have to work in the fields all day and your windows have glass, not strips of bamboo."
