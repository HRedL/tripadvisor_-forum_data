I was speaking to an agent in Tanzania today who seemed very well informed.He told me that an instruction has gone out from the government that visitors require a certificate stating that you are covid free (with a test no more than 72 hours before arrival). Does anyone have information about this?Thank you
"Yes, Its true they have introduced a new version but what happen is all people who arrived few days did not asked on their arrival to show covid 19 test certificates."
"That's a pain! It's complicated to get a teat and certificate in this time frame before travel and, despite people not being asked yet, it seems risky to travel without it."
All tour operators under Tato umbrella have been discussing this and we are waiting for an updates from the government/ministry of health.
Any idea when you could get the update?
Just to be clear. Is the current discussion about having a test 72 hours before travel or 72 hours before arrival. That could make a difference to feasibility though the added cost in UK is significant.
"I can only speak for my own experience, when we landed on Zanzibar on the 18th of July we were not asked for a negative test certificate (we didn't have one as we couldn't get one done on time before leaving), but were checked for temperature. Their thermometer was wildly badly calibrated as well, as they measured me at 33.4°C (!)Brightsafaris, when was the new version you speak of issued ?"
Wow. This is very troubling. It is impossible to get a negative test unless it’s a quick test and most countries aren’t accepting that.
"Saianel, see belwo website. They provide covid tests results by 72 hours, I just made an appoitment with them.www.passporthealthusa.com"
"Flights take 30 hours to get to Tanzania from Texas. Add in the confusion in the time change and you’d probably need results within 36 hours. Additionally, what testing are they asking for? Molecular (PCR) TestS , which is the all countries are asking for, is taking a very long time. The rapid tests are Antigen Tests. Would these be accepted? These are the only test results you can get rapidly."
"My TO showed forwarded me the policy, it says that you would need to get tested within 72 hours before travel at a approved labatory. It did not say which labatories are approved. My feeling is that they will be fine if its a legite test from a legite lab. Also my TO mentioned that she did not see the ""notice"" on the ministry of health website, so I am not sure if they will actually enforce it. We are going to get one just in case but feel confident that the test from Passport Health would be fine."

When do you travel?Do you mind sharing what you trip looks like?
https:/…index.html
The first day I am stopping by Tarangire and camping at the ngorongoro crater rim. Second day all day safari at ngorongoro crater. Third day hike Empaki Crater and start Northen Highland hike to Lake Natron. Arrive at lake Natron Thursday and hike up ol doinyo lengai Thursday night. Head to Mara region serengeti for the weekend. Leave Monday afternoon from kogatende airstrip to JRO and return home.
"and there it is:""and that the 'RT-PCR' method is used in Covid-19 testing'unless i am mistaken, this is not the rapid test laboratories offer :(Edited: 4:47 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"I contacted a local clinic offering a rapid antigen test and this was their response:Will a negative test result be acceptable for travel purposes? Guidelines and requirements for travel change frequently and are always evolving. We highly recommend that you check, with your desired destination for guidance, BEFORE your trip and booking a testing appointment, if a certain type of test is required. **Sometimes they will require a molecular (PCR) test, which is different than the antigen test we offer. **"
So UK government travel advice now confirms that to enter Tanzania “passengers must provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test performed within the 72 hours prior to boarding their flight”. The Dutch government website says the same but adding “the test must come from a laboratory certified in the country of departure”.
“Certified lab?”What does that even mean?
"Saianel, I imagine any reputable testing laboratory will be fine. More expense and hassle though. For sure, travelling is a wee bit more complicated these days"
"Jon D,the challenge is the wording used in the announcement:""a negative Covid-19 test"".Do they requite a molecular (PCR) test, which are taking very long to get in the US? or are rapid antigen tests good enough? those are plentiful and can be obtained the same day."
I understand but I’d be surprised if it was the antigen test.
"Interesting the IATA does not list it. I was told that it is supposed to start August 1. I am sure a little afterwards we will find out if they are actually enforcing the policy. I agree with Jon D, as long as the lab is legite, I think they will be okay with it. https:/…1580226297.htm"
"This is going to further hurt their tourism industry. It is virtually impossible to get the PCR test in less than 72 hours.I spent over an hour calling every private clinic in Austin, TX and the answer was pretty much the same. ""If you received the rapid test, you will receive a call with your results by the end of the business day. If you received the PCR test, you will receive results within 3-7 business days."""
"Maybe I did explain myself properly. There are 2 types of tests available to detect a current infection of COVID-19.he Antigen test identifies an active infection. There are two types of antigen tests; a molecular test commonly referred to as a diagnostic RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) test AND a rapid antigen test.some airlines (like Emirates) and some countries are specifically requiring the RT-PCR antigen test to be negative. These are the tests that are sent out to the lab and can take days to get a results.The other test, the rapid antigen test, is widely available and results are available the same day. The downside is that is not as accurate as the RT-PCR test"
"Reach out to Passport Health, they can get the results back within 72 hours.www.passporthealthusa.com"
According to the Tanzania Immigration website: https:/…visa-informationThe COVID test is not required (not listed in the entry requirements).Did anyone find any confirmed information about this?
The UK has updated their guidance for people traveling to Tanzania. I haven’t been able to find any other official websites outlining further details. https:/…tanzania
"Sorry Saianel, I mixed up my antigen and antibody tests before! (It was late :-).. As said, most countries do seem to opt for the PCR test but I have not seen any specification for Tanzania. I suppose you can get a covid-free certificate with the rapid test as well? As others have said, IATA has not updated its information and there does not yet seem to be official acknowledgement in published Tanzanian documentation. Dutch government travel advice website also has the negative Covid certificate requirement - so it's not just UK."
"There is a circular issued by the Ministry of health that was dated July 20th that states this requirement. But it is not on any official website so it has created a lot of confusion.Some speculate that this was more political than anything else. Anyway, there is no date stated when it is to go into effect and as of today it is not.The tour Operators Associations are try to get this cleared up with the knowledge that it is virtually impossible in most countries to get test results back in 72 hours. If you are planning to travel to Tanzania I would start making plans for this, finding a clinic who can ensure the turnaround and then keep your fingers crossed that the requirement are adjusted to be a bit more feasible, before it is time for you to travel."
"Good advice Etrip, that's what I have done. The risk comes if it's close to your travel date and the Tanzanian authorities change the requirement and make it a condition immediately so, even if you could get the test results in 72 hours, it would be too late for your flight!!"
We arrived on the 27th and got temperature taken but not asked for a covid result but it may have changed.
"So who is supposed to check the certificate and where? The airlines, before boarding? Or some under-educated staff at the TZ airport? Don't tell me it's the latter!"
Do you think they will accept print outs of your laboratory results or it’s a special kind of a COVID certificate?
We need answers! This is so vague!!!
If this actually does go into effect it would most likely be checked by both. The airline will not risk letting someone board without proper documentation as it then means they get to fly you home and also usually a fine.
what makes you think there is a chance that this does not go into effect? As far as I understand it already has
Murphys W - What is your assessment of the situation in Tanzania with regards to Covid 19?Are they socially distancing?Do you feel safe there?I am planning on travel there in October.
"as a matter of interest (maybe) two people I know were today 1 08 20 travelling from Addis Ababa to Arusha Tanzania via Nairobi.The first leg Air Ethopia- Addis to Nairobi then land private transfer to Namanga.They were denied boarding at Addis Ababa because they didn't have a negative Covid-19 certificate.They have already had a test and will now be travelling to Nairobi on Monday if negative and no other issues.Edited: 4:06 am, August 01, 2020 "
"that is very valuable information, thanks"
"This morning at Gdańsk airport SAS checked me in for the first leg to Copenhagen only as I did not have a covid certificate. According to IATA page this certificate is necessary upon entering Tanzania - that what I was told. My next flights are CPH-DOH and DOH-ZNZ. Luckily, there is a doctor at CPH airport offering various covid tests and results are within 15-25 minutes. Trying to save my holidays I spent a lot of money on a swab nose PCR test. A few minutes ago a nice CPH Qatar Airways consultant whom I spoke in the morning called me to let me know that Qatar Qirways will NOT require a covid test upon check-in. Argh, such a mess..."
"I really do question the anxiety of folks to visit Tanzania at the moment with such a confused and changing pattern of 'instructions'.TZ is obviously relying on the check in staff at your departure country to ensure you have a valid negative certificate for Covid hence the apparent lack of interest in your certificate on entry to TZ (that and the usual laissez f'aire attitude of officialdom.)Then we have the situation on the ground where TZ refuse to supply WHO with Covid figures which have stuck at 509 since March and yet Kenya next door have had 325 deaths and almost 20,000 cases.Travelling against the advice of your government will negate any help from your Insurers but you decide to risk it. Fine.But then you see the way situations change rapidly elsewhere (such as Spain and Australia) when countries Immigration and quarantine rules can and do change overnight leaving travelers having to cut short their trip or be stranded for as long as it takes.Is it really worth the risk to your pocket let alone your health?Personally I don't think so but that is just me."
Thanks for the updates Noexpert!
"Hi Mfuwe, yes it is your view and everyone does their own risk assessment and hopefully has researched from a range of sources the situation (pros and cons) as well as they can. And yes things can change quickly and you have to make a judgement about that too. Incidentally, you are not correct about invalid insurance. Sure existing insurance may be invalidated but In UK, Battleface insure against covid-19 to countries with a travel advisory against non-essential travel. Also the new requirement to get a certificate is not a bad thing. It means you travel in the knowledge you are unlikely to be travelling with the virus and it reduces the risk of travellers brining it into the country. So two ameliorating factors there.As for risk, you may have very low incidence in the Isle of Man but elsewhere in UK I suspect you are more likely to contract it going about your daily business than on a beach in Zanzibar or on the plains of the Serengeti where there are few people and virtually no tourists :-) In many ways, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to enjoy these extraordinary places without the considerable downside of mass tourism. Along with the hefty discounts currently available, that's not to be sniffed at :-)"
"I am with John D on this, I find it much more unlikely to get infected while on a safari in TZ than while shopping in a supermarket in mainland Europe (and I don't even want to think about the beach idiots in Spain, Croatia, and the likes)."
"I am with you both on the actual limited risks in the middle of the Serengeti. What exercises my mind is the trip out and back. Sure the need for the Certificate should ensure your fellow pax are clean but who knows who else you may contact in the terminals, I would route via MAN (now in strict lockdown once more) and AMS as well as in and out of JRO prior/after the driving.At home we are clean, no cases for 60+ days, simply because our lockdown worked and any arrivals are quarantined. No ifs, buts, whys or wherefores. As yet, NO non residents are allowed.Like you. I roll my eyes at the beaches elsewhere."
Update: Qatar Airways asked me for a negative covid-19 certificate at the check-in for CPH-DOH-ZNZ.
"I think it is quite a bit easier what you achieved at home simply because your island is so small. You just can't compare that to mainland Europe or even bigger islands like Australia. Yes, the airports are a a risk, but it is up to you to keep your distance as much as possible and furthermore, the wear a mask that not only protects others but also yourself. Again, walking through an airport for me is the same as walking through a supermarket."
@ Monika: did you have one? Or did you need to get it in Doha? And what was your experience after landing in ZNZ?
"Without diverting the topic ""or even bigger islands like Australia."" I would ask ""Why not?"" NZ did well as did Iceland and Ireland. Size does not matter if the political will is there. Look at Great Britain. Q.E.D."
"Mfuwe, Manchester airport (a place I normally loathe!) has been really quiet recently according to my wife and friends who have been through in the last couple of weeks. Well organised (yes in Manchester!!), swiftly through security (can only dream of that normally), lots of hand sanitising, everyone wearing masks, very easy to social distance.. all in all a surprisingly pleasant (yes I am talking about Manchester ha ha!) and reassuring travel experience."
"“My next flights are CPH-DOH and DOH-ZNZ. Luckily, there is a doctor at CPH airport offering various covid tests and results are within 15-25 minutes. Trying to save my holidays I spent a lot of money on a swab nose PCR test. ”Mmmmm... RT-PCR tests are sent to a laboratory. You mate have received a rapid antigen test. Monika,Would you be so kind to read your certificate and spell out that type of test you were given?I am in the Texas and I am finding it impossible to get RT-PCR test results within 72 hours due to the backlog of tests."
"I will just add that whilst you may “feel” very safe on safari or on a beach and “feel” you are very unlikely to catch Coronvirus whilst in Tanzania you do have to remember you are in Africa, with African standards of hygiene and cleanliness. Anyone who has been to East Africa will know how easy it is to pick up a stomach bug there when on safari or on the beach .......even when trying to be careful and washing hands regularly etc. It is a very frequent occurrence for tourists to become ill when on their holiday. On the basis that Covid is also transferred by “touching infected surfaces “ as well as by being in close proximity to People due to air droplets it seems to me that travellers will also be at risk of contracting coronavirus in the same way. . Especially given that the Tanzanian government denies the existence of coronavirus in Tanzania ( which we know is rubbish but which many Tanzanians seem to believe) and so no one now is really taking any precautions so who knows how my people are walking round spreading the virus. I would be very cautious about being too confident that you will be “safe” whilst on your holiday......and I certainly wouldn’t want to take my chances in a Tanzanian hospital if symptoms do develop whilst there.....very risky!!Edited: 10:29 am, August 01, 2020 "
"For a change can we have a simple exchange of facts without the moralizing? The topic is about certificate requirements. Countries make their own rules, and all the people I see on here discussing trips to Tanzania are aware of the lack of published figures there. They know the risks. Do we need every second comment to be a lecture about health and safety?Edited: 10:53 am, August 01, 2020 "
"I never said I'd feel ""safe"", there is no such thing as ""safety"", especially in these times. However, I've been travelling to East Africa for almost 20 years now, probably a dozen different trips, altogether and as far as I remember, I never caught a stomach bug.Yes, I am aware that TZ government denies the existence of Covid 19, but that doesn't mean the man on the street does, too. I wonder, though how you claim to know that nobody takes any precautions. Are you there, on the ground, and speak from first hand experience? Do you watch everybody to able to judge what everybody (or nobody) does? I understand that you would not risk travelling to TZ - fine. Probably you smoke, probably you drink alcohol, probably you ski, probably to drive a motorbike, Me, I don't do any of these things. It's all about how you yourself weigh a certain risk."
"@Mfuwe: I see the Isle of Man, Iceland and New Zealand in one league, and Australia in another. NZ seems to be blessed with a very fine government, unlike like GB (imho), so these factor do weigh in. However, I stand by my opinion: it is much easier to implement a complete lockdown / shutdown on an island than on a continent, and the smaller the island, the better / easier. Your Isle has what, a 100.000 inhabitants? Australia has 25 million, I believe."
"Oliver, Mfuwe,... time to put this discussion somewhere else I think. I know I contributed :-).. Mfuwe has had the same chat elsewhere with other people :-) let's keep this thread to the pertinent and important topic of the covid certificate. All the best to you both."
"Firstly Oliver.......my post was not addressed to you or any one person in particular but to all those reading forum who seem to be keen to set off to Tanzania and may be thinking that Tanzania Is safe because it has very low figures for coronavirus and the Tanzanian government is now claiming that Coronavirus doesn’t exist .....So no need to be quite so rude!!Secondly ........not “everyone” does know all the risks involved!! So maybe my comments help someone assess the situation ......maybe not......who knows if my post is helpful to someone - if it is not helpful to you don’t bother to take my notice of it....you don’t have to read or agree with everything I say but you also don’t have to be so rude!!Thirdly .......my comments are based on speaking regularly with my many friends across Tanzania who report that “no-one is now taking precautions anymore and life has returned to normal and people behave as they did pre- Covid” This fact is also backed up by people who post on this forum who are also living there now or who have relatives there.....I certainly don’t post such comments without checking the facts!!...but if you know better please update us!Forthly....how Can you say “ Probably you smoke, probably you drink alcohol, probably you ski, probably to drive a motorbike” ....YOU don’t KNOW me! So how can you possible make such a comment - it is ridiculous!! And actually I DONT smoke - never have!! and never have skied!! never have ridden a motorbike (laughable) and only drink alcohol in moderation...though what this has to do with anything in Tanzania I have no idea.!!! Making a ridiculous comment like that says much more about you, than about me.Edited: 11:41 am, August 01, 2020 "

I will try to change the topic again.Has anyone gotten clarification from Tanzania about what kind of COVID-19 tests will be accepted?Thanks
"@Saianel. My TO told me it's PCR test. He couldn't tell me where he got the info from so I'm not sure if that's true. I've also had a lot of difficulties to find a place that can turn around a PCR test in <72 hours in my state, Massachusetts, where the infection rate is very low. I hope Monika has got into Zanzibar without any problems and let us know what kind of test she had at the Copenhagen airport."
When do you travel Jon D?Turn around times in TX are 5-10 days
"Hi Saianel, I fly on 7 August 15;30 from London Heathrow with BA then 22:00 from Paris with Ethiopian via Addis (don't ask!). I was not sure what counts as the start of my travel! It may be the second flight as I'm thinking that Ethiopian will want to check I have the test certificate showing 72 hours before that flight. So that's an added complication. Anyway, I've booked a PCR test in Liverpool (45 minute drive fo me) for 5th August GBP120 (USD155) and am assured I will get the results and medical certificate in 24 hrs most likely 48 hours almost certainly!! Another matter though is whether a digital certificate will suffice or will I need to print it off? Anyone any info about that would be helpful as well.I did consider trying to change my Paris flight to Frankfurt as Frankfurt airport does a test there and you can get the result in 3 hours or 7 hours depending on what you pay - which may only be €60 or so. These Germans are always the best organised! But changing the flight ticket was too expensive.Hope you manage to sort things out and get clarification about the type of test."
Oh crap. It didn’t occur to me my itinerary is IAH-DOH-JRO ... who will ask for the certificate? Qatar agents in Houston or when I board my second flight in DOH. This is a sht show!
"Hey Folks - I am heading to Kenya on Monday. After four days there, I am meeting a friend in Tanzania. He was supposed to be with me but lives in San Diego and is banned from Kenya like all Californians. I am American and coming from Minnesota. I have had two covid tests in the past 8 days. I plan on getting a third when I land in Nairobi just so I have no issues when I cross the border into Tanzania at Nmanga. Side note: noexpert, I have not lost my mind ha ha. I am only being driven to Tanzania because there are no flying options at the moment. The rest of the trip is all a fly-in safari. Out of abundance of caution, I got an old-fashioned paper visa from the Kenya embassy in DC yesterday. We also have clients arriving in JRO on Monday and I will try and report back on how that goes. But, I fly before they land so it will be delayed. I will get my TZ visa at the border and have three covid tests in my possession!I feel pretty safe flying. The infection rate of Delta employees is less than the general population in their hub cities of Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit, etc.I had a friend with clients in the Crater today. They saw 10 vehicles in a six hour game drive! If you are healthy and can isolate before and after your trip, now is the time to go folks.Craig Beal - owner - Travel BeyondEdited: 4:43 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"Craig,Please report how that goes. Have your clients gotten tested?Do you know the type of COVID-19 test they got? Was it a rapid antigen test or a RT-PCR year?What is your friend planning to do?Thank you"
The certificate reads:Swab test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) - PCR.The doctor offered also an antigen test but it was not appropriate for Tanzania.You can check all tests info at airportdoctor dot dkI am at Doha airport right now and waiting for my flight to ZNZ :)
Yay! Keep us updated Monika what happens in the ground. I’m wondering if the 72-hr starts when you board your initial flight or when you take your connecting flight to Tanzania.
"Saianel, let's see what Monika says but I imagine if the connecting flight is with the same airline it is the first flight with that airline that will count. My issue is that I am with 2 different airlines. BA from London to Paris. Then Ethiopian from Paris to Addis to ZNZ. I suspect my 72 hours before requirement will begin with the Ethiopian flight at Paris.If it was just checked on arrival at ZNZ then I could argue that my journey began in London but I'd be less confident trying to make that case with a new airline. I suspect they wouldn't want to take the risk."
"My friend is flying into JRO and has two PCR tests so far in the past 6 days. Here is what my personal test says: ""SARS Coronovirus-2, PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA absent."" I get my second results back very soon.As far as I know, the client got a PCR test on Friday and they are good to go. But, MANY sources confirmed that Tanznaia is not enforcing until August 9.It is my understanding the entire industry in Tanzania is lobbying hard to get the government to put in writing ""7 days before departure flight"".Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond"
"Monika, is that a paper certificate or a digital one?"
"Craig, Tanzania may or may not be enforcing until 9 August. But it seems the airlines already are. So if you don't have the certificate you likely can't board your flight to Tanzania"
"It is a paper certificate, don't have a digital one. I had to show it at CPH airport only before my first flight with Qatar Airways and got both boarding cards: CPH-DOH and DOH-ZNZ."
"Thanks Monika,Please excuse but I clicked on your post history - totally off topic but did you get to Fatu Hiva? I was absorbed many years ago with Thor Heyerdhal's book about his and his wife's time there and, in my mind, it merged with Aldous Huxley's"" Island"" utopia!You just lit a spark in me to get there one day :-)"
"Side note: noexpert, I have not lost my mind ha ha.Now Craig where did I say you have lost your mind......Ha ha ha .....Why would I think that??????But I will also let you know Monday what happens with my friends who are in Addis now who expect to cross at Namanga on Monday.Edited: 5:54 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"Craig,Thanks for your comments. Where are you and your friends getting such quick RT-PCR tests with such quick results?I haven’t been able to find anyone in Austin who can provide results so quick. My VA spent a couple of hours Friday calling every clinic in town."
Saianel - please try The Covid Consultant. https://thecovidconsultants.com/ I have the good fortune of being in the Mayo Clinic network and they turn it around fast. My first test was back in 54 hours and my second test was taken 50 hours ago.NoExpert - I would greatly appreciate hearing about your friend's experience at Namanga. Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond
"Dear Jon D, yes, I spent 4 days on Fatu Hiva and 3 weeks in the Marquesas last year :) Cannot even say how I loved it! I'm totally in love with South Pacific islands, was planning Kiribati+Tonga this year, but the coronavirus. However, happy to be in Zanzibar as it was always on my list as well.Back to the main topic: no one asked me for the covid certificate at the airport (just temperature and health declaration). So it seems these are airlines being overcautious."
"Craig , where were you planning on getting tested in Nairobi?I’m in a similar situation, due to fly 29th August to Nairobi, spending 4 nights in Kenya then due to fly to Zanzibar. We would need tested in Kenya to comply with the 72hr rule.Thanks very much, Danielle."
"Dear Monika, that sounds phenomenal!!I'm pleased you have arrived into Zanzibar. Hope you have a wonderful time. Fingers crossed I will be there too on Saturday. Should our paths cross, I'd love to chat about your South Pacific Islands experiences :-)"
"Hi Danielle L,I will let you know tomorrow. I don't know yet!Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond"
"That's great, thank you!"
"There're a few countries in Africa now require tourists to conduct COVID 19 test within certain hours prior to the date of departure. I would think more countries will introduce the same rules soon. This will cause a lot complex issues to me and other tourists that planning to visit multiple countries in one trip. I am a bit worried now. Though my trip is in next year, the whole pandemic situation might not change much until a safe and effective vaccine is widely available."
Is covid certificate required to exit zanzibar thanks
"@Keving. Depends where you are going. Not for UK (at the moment anyway!). If you are headed somewhere else, have a look at IATA or FCO entry requirements."
@Danielle L - here is the testing info:My covid test will be done by AMREF Flying Doctors at their clinic at Wilson Airport. AMREF.org.I get the test when I land on Wednesday morning so that I have results back on Saturday as I head to Tanzania.Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond

"Craig Beal that's great, thanks very much for that, I'll look into it!"
Hi by the way those people I know who were supposed to fly to Nairobi then go to Tanzania via Namanga missed their flight in Addis Ababa due to visa issues nothing to do with having a correct corona negative certificate.
"Thank you Craig Beal for updating us. Your information is very helpful!! I am flying from USA to Tanzania in early Sept and I too was concerned about 72 hr COVID test requirement. Is Rapid Test which I will get the result within 24hr comply with their requirement or not. No way, I can get the PRC test result in timely manner before I fly if I go get the test 72hrs prior to departing USA! We are flying thru Amsterdam -JRO. Please keep us posted and Thank you very much again for your information! Have a wonderful Safari! Cannot wait to be back in my game vehicle! Regards, Eiko"
"I am slightly bothered how little information has surfaced since August 1st specifically in regards to the test requirements.There's lots of places where I can get a rapid antigen covid-19 test, but no places to get RT-PCR tests."
"hey (Eiko) - i have been researching this too. At the moment all advice says All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents entering Tanzania will be required to present a valid NEGATIVE COVID-19 certificate from an approved laboratory in a departure country tested within 72 hours before travel. there is no mention of PCR vs antigen. At this stage it is still not clear, and have some contacts in TZ I am requesting clarity from.Annoyed they just added this with no notice, but I am sure we can figure out what is working for others."
"Does anyone know if the actual test has to be taken within 72 hours of departure, or do you just need your results back within 72 hours? For example, if you're leaving on a Friday, could you get the test done the previous Friday and receive the results by Thursday and be good to go the next day, or would it be invalid because the previous Friday was more than 72 hours before?"
Currently it is required no more that 72 hours before you fly
"Does anybody know if the test results are checked by the airlines before the very first leg or the last leg of the flight?I am planing to go from SFO to ZNZ with a layover at IST via Turkish airlines. I would like to use the facilities in IST airport for covid testing, and I am wondering if this is possible.If the airlines is checking the test results before my first leg at SFO, I have to get a test at SF and no facility in SF guarantees a 72 hour return on the test results according to my research.If the airlines is checking the test results before my last leg before Tanzania at Istanbul, then I might be able to get tested in IST and get my results before my Tanzania flight.Any body have similar experience with Turkish airlines or any other airlines? Thanks."
Someone mentioned Qatar checked the test results while getting the boarding pass at the airport of origin and nobody checked it while boarding the second flight in Doha.
"""If the airlines is checking the test results before my last leg before Tanzania at Istanbul, then I might be able to get tested in IST and get my results before my Tanzania flight.""And what will you and the airline do if you test positive in IST? I doubt you will be allowed to board in SFO without the certificate."
"Dear All,Just to update on this constant changing situation. The Ministry of Health issued Travel Advisory No 5 today. It states:""2. All travelers weather foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling, will be required to present a certificate upon arrival. Travellers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection, will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR""While the wording is slightly unclear, it appears that if you are on an airline or the country you live in will require a test when you return from Tanzania then Tanzania will also require that you have a certificate prior to arrival. It does not sate a time frame or any other details.A few people I know travelled to Tanzania since the 1st of Aug. They were asked for proof of negative COVID test by the airline but not by anyone on arrival. Now it seems the requirement is being adjusted, but I sounds like the responsibility mainly lands on the airline. So check with your airline as to what they will require."
"Well, this is even more confusing... I’m flying Qatar and coming from the US. None of them require a test to fly or return. Am I exempt?"
"@SaianelFrom what the text says, it seems to me that you won't need a test to go to Tanzania, but in all honesty it depends mainly on how the airline interprets the wording.  You can check here for Qatar https:/…visa-and-passport-requirements.htmlCurrently it shows yes need for test, but remember the new circular was only issued today so will probably need some time for an update."
"ETripAfrica2, thanks for the info. Where does one see the Ministry of Health's updates such as the one you posted? I looked on their website but didn't see it under Announcements or in the covid-19 section."
"Good question. I usually get it when it through a trade association or from a friend at TTB. If you pm me your email I would be happy to email it to you.Edited: 10:42 am, August 05, 2020 "
"ETripAfrica2, thanks so much for the offer. My possible trip won't be until October, so I may take you up on that closer to that time."
Anyone know what's going on with Ethiopian Airlines? They're still showing the testing requirement on their COVID page. https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/aa/travel-updates/updates-on-covid-19(coronavirus) Perhaps they just haven't updated yet? I've got some time - leave on Aug 18
Noexpert did your friends get asked for proof of a covid test in Zanzibar?
My TO sent me an announcement from Tanzania MOH Prof. Mabula D. Machembe Permanent Secretary MOH (TRAVEL ADVISORY NO. 5 OF 5TH AUGUST 2020) that says tests are only required for those whose countries or airlines require them for travel. I would post the doic i have but dont see how to do that here on TA
"I’m flying today with Ethiopian. I’ll let you know what has happened! UK gov has just updated travel advice and removed certificate requirement! Just after I spent £120 for it!! Anyway , at least I know I don’t have Covid-19!"
"Thanks jon D - who are you flying with - I have just seen the UK have removed that requirement, Ethiopian Airlines still shows it - but hoping that gets adjusted in the next few days also. Enjoy - and hope all goes well. Please let us know how you get on."
"Requirement also removed from IATA information as well. That, I understand tends to drive airline requirements."
Hi Joe. I’m flying with Ethiopian
"I would just like to state for anyone else reading this that unfortunately, covid tests do have a tendency to have a high false negative rate. They are not foolproof and just because you tested negative does not mean that you do not have the virus. Hopefully more accurate tests will become available very soon."
JoeGk- Thanks so much. This is very helpful.
"Wohoo, as far as I noticed with a quick query on Google, Ethiopian Airlines wants a negative PRC test from and to UAE and Qatar Airways wants it only in certain routes but not from/to Tanzania. Turkish Airlines isn't flying this route at the moment."
"We just back and were not asked for one, but the policy may have changed while we were there as I got an email from the US embassy. Our guide knew nothing about it though, and he is a official govt employee. They are not organized at the airport really, I cant see them turning you away, they are dying for tourists now."
Ewida- Thanks so much for your feedback. I am going to Tanzania in October. Did you have any safety concerns regarding the virus while there?Are they wearing masks? Social distancing? Etc.
"So I flew yesterday evening with Ethiopian Airlines from Paris and arrived via Addis in Zanzibar. I’m afraid that my experience is not really going to clear things up completely. I checked in online and had a digital boarding pass on my phone and, only travelling with hand luggage, was taken aside for a further Check-in at the gate to be issued with a paper boarding pass. Many other passengers were going through a similar process and were being asked for negative Covid certificates. One person seemed to be refused boarding for being outside the 72 hours window. I don’t know if these passengers final destination was Addis or elsewhere. When I was asked where I was travelling onwards to, An Ethiopian representatives told me that they didn’t require a Covid certificate from me. So it’s clearly not a requirement to fly on Ethiopian but depends on your destination. Anyway all that seemed to fit with the latest reports and it saved me any worry that my certificate might not be approved for some bureaucratic reason. I thought that was that. Imagine my surprise then when I arrived at the entrance to immigration at Zanzibar. All passengers were being asked to produce their negative Covid certificates. I dug mine out, it was quickly looked at and after a temperature check I was waved through to sort out my visa on arrival. A couple of other passengers I spoke to also had certificates and had passed through. However, I don’t know the protocol if you turn up without one. I guess one possibility (and the latest wording kind of implies this) is that you may be required to take a test if you turn up without evidence of a recent one. But that is pure speculation on my part. ."
Thanks Jon D - will keep an eye over the next week. I suspected as much that the changes are not as clear as they may read. Anyone travelling on Ethiopian soon from the UK would love to hear if the certificate is not needed.
"Hi Everyone - I was on safari in Kenya this past week and had to hire a driver to take me to Arusha by road today. There are no flights from Kenya to Tanzania at the moment. At the border today, the Tanzania officials asked for negative test results. I gave them my results from a test I took on July 24 (results received July 26). I was told that was too old. So, I gave them the results from a test I took at AMREF in Nairobi on August 5 (results received August 6). They let me through with the more recent results.I have a friend from California that was supposed to be on safari in Kenya with me. He could not go because Kenya banned Californians. He is flying KLM into Kilimanjaro/JRO tonight and I will try to report back on what happens to him.I knew a few people were waiting for my report on my experience earlier in the week. I did not have wifi in the Mara. I did see 25,000+ Wildebeest crossing the Mara!Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond"
"Hello!I was hoping for some clarification re: if a negative Covid-19 is needed to enter Tanzania? I was under the impression that the rules were reversed several days ago and the test is no longer required except if the airline requires one? But I saw in Craig’s post below that he was asked for a test to enter today?I am flying from Hong Kong via Doha to Kilimanjaro on Saturday 16th. At this minute, Qatar doesn’t require a negative test to fly or transit. I have tried calling the Tanzania Consulate here for clarification last week, but to no avail. Thank you in advance!"
"He was asked because his home country Austria requires it. I think Tanzanian government reversed the policy that it's needed if the country or origin or the airline company requires it.Edited: 12:47 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"""TRAVEL ADVISORY NO.5 OF 05th AUGUST, 2020The Government has slightly modified the Travel Advisory No. 4 of 20th July, 2020 and come-up with version No 5, effective from 05th August, 2020 to accommodate additional measures related to international travel as follows:2. All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose _COUNTRIES OR AIRLINES_ require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling, will be required to present a certificate upon arrival."
Thank you for the clarification! I had a mini panic moment when I saw Craig’s post :)I might go ahead and do the test anyway as an extra precaution and to have peace of mind.
"Volleyball,Craig is from the USA not Austria!! And he crossed the border In Tanzania from Kenya by road, he didn’t enter Tanzania on a flight."
Could someone please clarify the type of test needed for Tanzania or does it depend on the airline?Is it specifically PCR? And is it that negative results need to be received no more than 72hrs before entering the country? Thanks
"ShepOfBristol, sorry, I mixed Craig with Jessie that made a a thread today that she needed a Covid test from Austria to Dar Es Salaam. It is likely that in the land borders they ask this negative certificate as Craig posted. Kenya has a lot of cases."
"@Lisa L., yes it is PCR. And yes 72 hours. Apparently some people got confused with the other one (Antigen) but Antigen only tests if you have had Corona already (and have antibodies therefore)I am not entirely sure about the rule from August 5th, does it mean: if I am from Germany, and Germany requires returnees from Tanzania to get tested upon return, THEN i have to have been tested also before entering Tanzania. ?Sounds a bit like silly retaliation – people coming from TZ into DE need a test so we do it vice versa! And the rest doesn't have to!"
"Omg. There is so much misinformation in this post. There are 3 types of tests:1) The PCR test looks for pieces of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the nose, throat, or other areas in the respiratory tract to determine if the person has an ***active infection***2) The Antigen tests look for pieces of proteins that make up the SARSCoV-2 virus to determine if the person has an ***active infection***3) The Serology tests looks for antibodies1 against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood to determine if there was a ***pastinfection***Edited: 12:23 am, August 10, 2020 "
Craig. Good for you. I have been trying to see the Wildebeest migration since 2012.
"@saianel: oh sorry, then i mixed up antibody and antigen. but that's about it with so much misinformation, it's PCR that is required for entry in Tanzania."
"Hi Crisi,The test requirement depends on your airline or country. The latest advisory states:“ 2. All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose _COUNTRIES OR AIRLINES_ require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling, will be required to present a certificate upon arrival.”"
"Craig, I am very interested in your California friend's experience in getting in to Tanzania. I am hoping to fly in on 01 September, and since I am from Florida, I'm in the same situation as the Californua and Texas people. I know a lot can change in the next three weeks, but I'm trying to keep up on the latest requirements, I doubt that I will be able to get results from a COVID test within 72 hours in Florida. Thanks!Edited: 10:40 am, August 10, 2020 "
"You can get a rapid test in florida and have the results within 15 minutes (I had one done because of possible exposure to a positive family member). The rapid test I had done is the antigen test and I was a given a copy of the results. I believe that Passport Health can do a PCR test with results in 72 hours. Timing is key, I agree!"
Negative about PassportHelath. I emailed them last week and told me they’re not doing PCR at this time. (Texas)
"Interesting, I spoke to them (in central Florida) last week and the Winter Park office said that they could. My rescheduled from May trip is now planned for October. Who knows what the requirements will be then?"
Can I ask where it says that the test required to get into Tanzania Is the PCR test? I was told that is the requirement (at this time) for Kenya.
Nowhere does it say PCR. all it says is negative Covid test for people whose airlines or origin countries require it
"Thanks, that's what I thought (and have been told by my TO)."
"@Saianel That may be what it says but, as I reported the other day, neither my airline (Ethiopian) or my country UK) requires a Negative Covid test Certificate and yet I was asked for one on arrival at Zanzibar 2 days ago. This thread seems to be going round in circles at the moment! :-)"
"@JonThe second half of that policy from 8/5 says ""Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR;""So I wonder if you would've just been tested had you not had one? It seems like Ethiopian would not be flying people there without checking this, if there was potential for you to be denied entry at the border, but who knows.I leave on 8/19 flying from DC via Addis on ET, so I'm interested to hear others reports. I'm getting a test performed on 8/16 anyways (from Univ. of Colorado, so not labcorp/quest in hopes of speedier results), but there's no guarantee on when results will be available.Hopefully we'll get some more reports before then. Regardless, I'll definitely share results on my experience. Now if I can just find an open hotel in Nungwi, Zanzibar. 0 for 2 on hotels - they've been accepting reservations, but then cancelling on me a week later..."
"Jon, why do you post false information? Ethiopian Airlines stats in it's own website:""TanzaniaRT-PCR TEST REQUIREMENTSAll travelers whether foreigners or returning residents entering Tanzania will be required to present a valid NEGATIVE COVID-19 certificate from an approved laboratory in a departure country tested within 72 hours before travel. ""https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/aa/travel-updates/updates-on-covid-19(coronavirus)"
"If you are unable to get PCR results by the time you land, are there quarantine accommodations in Arusha while you wait for results? Or, if this is just for airlines, does this mean they just won't board you unless you show them negative PCR test results right away at the airport?"
"@VolleyballI think Ethiopian's website is conflicting right now. It looks like they never updated the PCR test with the 8/5 change. If you go to the country entry restriction page (at the same url you provided), the ET site states -""TanzaniaUnited Republic of Tanzania travel advisory:Effective Date: 05 August 2020.All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents entering or leaving the United Republic of Tanzania will be subjected to enhanced screening for COVID-19 infection. There will be no 14 days mandatory quarantine upon arrival;All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling, will be required to present a certificate upon arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR;""So Jon is completely correct. He also reported that Ethiopian did not require the test for check in, which is consistent with this statement. Looks like Ethiopian needs to update the ""RT-PCR Test"" section of their website - as that has not changed since the now repealed requirement it mentions was put into effect on 8/1.Edited: 6:55 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"Cotraveller82 - I agree. I called Ethiopian direct and they are saying that a certificate is needed, and noted their website shows conflicting info. I checked with klm and they are also stating a certificate is needed online, when checking the “preparing for travel” link.In reality it seems the airlines are still enforcing a PCR negative certificate is required 72 hours before travel regardless of the new guidance by Tanzania.I would highly recommend all travellers check with their airlines before travel.I hope this gets cleared up soon -Edited: 3:22 am, August 11, 2020 "
"@JoeGK - you are correct, I would highly recommend all travelers to check with their airlines before travel."
"@cotraveler82 - for an open hotel in Zanzibar you can try Gold Zanzibar which is in Kendwa, a walking distance to Nungwi village and beaches. Kendwa is a nice beach too!!"
"@volleyball. I only posted the information about Ethiopian from my own experience departing from Paris on 7 August to Zanzibat via Addis. I think I was clear in my post that this was my personal experience. If you choose to disbelieve me there’ is nothing I can do about that. That said, it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that someone else may have a different experience such are the seemingly rapidly changing requirements and some grey areas. As I mentioned earlier some other people were required to have Covid certificates to board at Paris but I do not know what there final destination was. I would have absolutely no reason or agenda in posting “false information” - it was even I who started this thread with a request for clarification in the first place :-). All the best and any apology will be humbly received :-)"
"This thread is full of contradicting information at the moment. What would have happened in Zanzibar if one didn't have a negative certification at the arrival?Cotraveler82, your mentioned chapter is from Tanzanian government and it mandates the airline company a right to demand a negative certificate as your quote states. The PCR-RT section in the same page explicitly states that Ethiopian Airlines requires it. Therefore their website ISN'T showing any conflicting info - what's the conflict there? Jon probably got onboard by an individual mistake of an officer at the check-in counter who didn't ask it. An apology sent. :-)"
"Thanks, Volleyball..respect.Your point in your latest first paragraph was precisely the question I asked too. I don’t know the answer to that as I had a certificate (even though Ethiopian did not ask to see it) to show at Zanzibar immigration. With that, I I’ll bow out of his thread that I started. I cannot add anything more that is factual as my experience is now in the past.Thanks to all contributors as it was enormously helpful in trying to figure out what actions I needed to take. Good luck to all."
"@Volleyball -That's the old PCR info in my opinion (also from the prior version of the Tanzania declaration, and not updated since that came out), which is about as good as anyone's at this point without more info. The Tanzania government spiel is about an airline requiring it for all passengers in my reading of it. Without more first hand experiences - there's not much more we can really read into this. To me Jon's experience is the most accurate depiction of what is really happening at the airport at this point. @JoeGK - thanks for sharing the info from your call. I think all the airlines are just about as confused as us at this point it sounds. I'm having one done anyways - just not sure if it will be done in time - we'll see. I'm not going to bother calling anyone - they're either going to ask for it or they're not. And I'll either have it on hand, or I'll get screwed by the COVID testing gods and I'll have to deal with it then. No sense worrying about it. I would be interested any anyone else's future experience on an ET flight to TZ.Edited: 8:09 pm, August 11, 2020 "
Also the PCR test requirements on that page are set by the countries...not ET. I checked Austria and Kenya and those pages agree to each other. The entry requirement just covers all the other requirements in addition. Not sure why they need two pages - but something is obviously out of sync.
@brightsafari Thanks for the Zanzibar recommendations! Much appreciated.
"My son is going to Tanzania in September. There are three kinds of Covid testing.Can anyone please tell me which one he should take...as you have stated, trying to get it within the 72 hrs. per their request is a bit challenging. I understand there are three ways to be tested also..was wondering if the one for antibodies is acceptable."
Here is the link from the Health Alert fro the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam.https:/…All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to provide negative testing for COVID-19 as a condition for traveling will be required to present a certificate on arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested on arrival.A test is only required if required by the airline or the country from which you are coming.
"Further to the information re Ethiopian airways - PCR test needed Tanzania requirement seems to have been removed as of today. Obviously things are changing...but for now seems Ethiopian is NOT requiring PCR negative tests Again would love to hear of any recent or upcoming travellers from the UK, as I will be travelling to kili in mid september"
JoeGK.You do realise that you will face 14 days compulsory isolation on your return?
Yes....not a problem for me...
"Glad to hear Ethiopian finally got their act together! I just had my test today - but they told me 3 to 5 days for results. Glad I don't have to sweat that out any more, but it was probably the right thing to get a test done before major international travel. Leaving on Tueday! DEN - SFO - Frankfurt - Addis - JRO - Zanzibar. Going to be a long travel day. Hope there are no more flight cancellations - between Ethiopian and United I've had 4 so far!Edited: 5:29 pm, August 16, 2020 "
Let us know how you get on and if they ask on arrival @cotraveller82 - safe travels.
What if you test 72 hrs before traveling and you don't get tests results back 1 to 2 weeks later?
"*important information* (if it's true)I wrote to the German embassy in Dar es Salaam, asking about the necessity of a negative PCR Covid19 test. Their answer was, I quote: Hello dear German embassy! I am coming from Berlin to Dar for an internship soon (29th of August) and I am confused about the new Covid19 regulations. The sentence ""All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to provide negative testing for COVID-19 as a condition for traveling will be required to present a certificate on arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested on arrival."" isn't clear to me.Vielen Dank für deine Nachricht. Wir sind gerade nicht erreichbar, werden uns jedoch bei dir melden.Thank you for your message. We are currently not available, but we will contact you.Do I have to get tested here in Germany before boarding the flight? Can the results be 72 hrs old max or 96?It's not so easy and quite expensive to get tested without having symptoms ...19:00Tanzania doesn’t require International arrivals to present COVID-19 Certificate, upon arrival in Tanzania entry point you will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms.Oh wow! Are you sure?That would be really good newsThe information about testing is for travelers who are returning to Germany after traveling from countries which are considered high risk such as TanzaniaYes, that's true, they will require and provide tests in Berlin airport.Great that you could resolve this sentence for me – I was really confused, and so are others.Schreibe eine Nachricht ..."
"So, in short: we don't need the test for entering. Just for exiting (according to our country's regulations). The text in August 6th's regulations was probably just not written well ."
"So I just entered at Kilimanjaro international. The only place I was asked for a covid test was at Frankfurt boarding the flight to Addis. I think he was just asking everyone, as I'm not sure he knew my final destination when he asked. I tried to clarify but got some confusing answer. Go figure. I had one so just showed it to him. He looked for my name and that's about it. I don't think he checked the date I was not asked for it in Addis or going through immigration in jro. They have you fill out a form, and take your temperature. That was it. I found the whole immigration process to be very friendly and welcoming - probably moreso than I've had anywhere in recent memory. They seem glad to have visitors as I was one of only a handful on my flight that weren't returning residents.So not sure what's going on with Ethiopian, but they definitely are not concerned with a certificate at jro immigration. Also fwiw they didn't bring up a yellow fever vaccination either - was expecting to have to deal with that having transited in Ethiopia. Overall, Tanzania has left a great first impression on me."
Thanks for the update and glad your first impression in great Tanzania is a really friendly country and they are going out of their way to welcome tourists. Please keep us updated about your travels if you get the time.
"Joe and eTrip are correct, as of today (21 Aug) at least. It's best to check with the airline. Emirates requires a test when flying to Tanzania. https:/…81336As your trip isn't until October, and so much can change in that time, you'll want to also keep abreast of any mandatory quarantines. For example, Kenya is requiring US citizens who are residents of California, Florida and Texas to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, but the other states are exempt. Not sure how they'll monitor that as someone can be a resident of another state and fly via one of those three states.Certainly not straightforward. Hope it all works out and that you're able to go."
"Thanks for the updates cotraveler82, this sound good!!"
"Hi, I'm looking to fly to ZNZ in November, I know its a way off and things change but can anyone update me on the current situation regarding Covid testing? I am flying from Malaga, Spain to ZNZ via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. What is there policy at the moment regarding testing. I am aware that they are not flighing to ZNZ just yet but the rout is about to open as of October? Thanks."
I just returned from Tanzania. ( August 2020) There is no required testing to enter. A temperature check and fill out a form stating your current health condition is what is required to enter. There is no body sick there as far as I could tell as far as all my traveled to locations is concerned. I think It is a safe place to travel to.
"Thanks Brian, did you have to show a valid Civid test certification to the airline before you left your first destination?"
"I arrived in Tanzania yesterday and thought I would post of my experience.My flight was with Ethiopian from London Heathrow > Addis Ababa > Kilimanjaro. At check-in, in London I was asked if we had our COVID test results or we were planning on getting a test when we arrived. I had our results so showed them. I didn’t need them again and on arrival in Kilimanjaro we had to fill out a health declaration form and had our temperatures recorded. That was it, no request for test results in Tanzania. Hope this is helpful!"
"Thanks WittyLondon, it sound like its best to get a test prior to departure. Enjoy your trip."
Thanks for the update! Are there any updates from Qatar flights? It seems most people that are asked for COVID tests are asked when boarding Ethiopian Airlines flights when Europe.
"It does seem to be the airlines that are requesting the test, it doesn't seem to be the Tanzania Government."
The airlines are checking to prevent you being refused on arrival and them having to return you home.As well as protecting all passengers.
Tanazania embassy says very. Clearly that we do not need any test and no quarantine is imposed. QATAR air website also says that USA doesn't need any testing from August 13. When I called they said we do need negative test. When I called to find out If there are labs that will do 72 hours prior the answer was: you are risking it. We might be able to do it but in most cases it takes a week. Mfuwe: don't you think it makes no sense to make a test 3 days prior? Covid is not HIV where you can get tested and then have safe sex and not catch it again. Airlines can hardly protect any passenger with this silly policy. You can test negative only to get Infected few minutes later and get on that plane being already infected.
Anyway.. it's very stressful to get ready for any trip with these covid testing. So many uncertainties. Really frustrating
Ok so I havegood news for those flying Qatar from the states to Tanzania. I just had a talk with several different people from there and all of them said : we only need RAPID test. It's the Antibody test that takes 15 minutes for results. Ut doesn't matter what the result is you still allowed to board. Tanzania DOES NOT need test results and they basically adm it t everyone i to the country who doesn't have symptoms.
"We just flew DFW to DOH. We are headed to JRO. Qatar staff didn’t ask us for any Covid testing even though we took the RT-PCR 2 days prior. Other passengers were asked for COVID testing, but they were headed to other destinations. There were 5 passengers in business class. Economy seemed fuller.Edited: 12:35 pm, August 30, 2020 "
"""Mfuwe: don't you think it makes no sense to make a test 3 days prior? "" Well it's not my call. It is not you MUST have a clear test 72 hours old but just that any Certificgte you have must be LESS than 72 old. There is a difference.I would not call any policy Silly that tries to prevent the spread of this disease that has accounted for so many deaths around the world and is STILL doing so. It is spread in the air so prophylactics don't work. I wish they did and then we would all be safe.At present the only way to be safe is to isolate but it seems folks are prepared to risk lives just to enjoy themselves on a holiday."
"#178 - So Qatar Airways is now saying that people flying from airports in the US to Tanzania need to have a rapid test but it doesn't matter what the results are? So if the results are positive you're still allowed to board? Qatar Airways website very clearly states that only people from 7 countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Philippines, & Sri Lanka) are required to show proof a test within 96 hours prior to boarding, and Tanzania isn't currently requiring a test to enter if you're coming from the US. Are the phone representatives contradicting what their actual website says?"
"Qatar isn’t asking for any proof unless the country requires it. We got on the plane from Dallas less than 15 hours ago. FYI, Most US flights are landing in DOH around 4-5pm. The one flight to JRO departs at 1am. The layover is very long and unless you have lounge access or pay for a room at the Oryx Airport Hotel, it will be a heck of an uncomfortable layover."
"I would definitely call MANY policies very silly. To require 72 hours prior to boarding test is silly Vs immediate test at the gate and social distancing . Masks are better than nothing but usefulness of it is anecdotal. When we talk about nbers of death it's silly to not compare those numbers to other stats around the world. To base such drastic decision as lockdowns on still low death predominantly in people over 70 is exceptionally silly and dangerous. So it's a lot of silliness going in . But what not silly is keep living our lives and travel, at the same time being cautious. What silly is to lock ourselves at home if we are not over 70 but healthy young or not so young adults."
Saianel - thanks for the info. Hopefully ours won't be as bad. We have lounge access but probably won't use it as we're on a flight that departs at 6:10 PM from Doha to JRO with only an 1 hr 25 min layover in Doha. Enjoy your trip :)
"Yes exactly..seems like they are contradicting. Lately seems like the whole world is very much confused . Now listen to this: the RAPID test how they call it is antibody test which basically tells if we were sick with Covid or not. Nothing else. It doesn't say anything about whether we have it now or not. At first I couldn't believe what I was hearing ,that's why I called and talked to different representatives and all of them confirmed the same . That's why they don't even ask for it at the gate. Because it's really means nothing. It's not the other test which KLM requires and that's why I am not flying with them . Can't risk it. I also agree with notion that may be because I indicated Tanzania and Qatar knows that I wouldn't be turned away on arrival"
My layover is 21 hours from New York. We can get visa on arrival and take taxi to any hotel.
"Traveler - Thanks for the clarification, and you're correct, the antibody test is certainly not as useful as a PCR test. It's challenging keeping up with all the changing requirements."
"""I would definitely call MANY policies very silly. To base such drastic decision as lockdowns on still low death predominantly in people over 70 is exceptionally silly and dangerous. ""Some may agree with you. Others won't. Unfortunately there are 187,000 folks in the USA that you can no longer ask as they are no longer alive to have a choice."
"Traveler - This is what is posted on the U.S. Embassy site for Tanzania.""All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to provide negative testing for COVID-19 as a condition for traveling will be required to present a certificate on arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested on arrival.""I am taking a flight to Tanzania early October 2020. I don't plan on getting an testing before boarding the plane. I did not see anything on Qatar Airlines website that states a test of any sort is required for Tanzania. The average turnaround time for testing in Los Angeles can be up to 7 days, which makes the test null and void anyway.I will keep looking for changes prior to leaving the states are things are rapidly changing.Thanks for your information."
"#183 - I beg to differ. People from all age groups are being affected by COVID-19. In Los Angeles County, 60% of current cases are in the age group from 18-49. People of all ages, including children, have succumbed to the virus.That being said, I do agree that it makes no sense to lock ourselves in the house and not go on with living (taking precautions)."

"When you say a number you must look at it in relation to other numbers . To look at just number and say o my god this is terrible, is not logical. There is such thing as stats. And we all know by now that numbers were inflated and misrepresented as in US hospitals get paid 10 times more by Covid related admissions by insurances than just regular flu. But even if these numbers were correct ..considering that 88% of dead are people over 70 and half of these people were in nursing homes, the rest of us not in this category are taking chances. With that said I am not sure what contribution you are making in this forum other than telling.poeplw to stay home and not travel?"
"Ok "" cases"" ..what does it even matter? People get sick..but did they die from it? There were 8 kids in Florida who were reportedly died from Covid out of 2.5 million school age children. At the same time 15k kids passed away from.other illnesses in US same time frame including 6 times more the number from.regular flu. People dont realize how many of us out there."

"FYI, in the US a rapid test can be an antigen (not antibody) test. An antigen test shows whether or not you currently have the virus. ""Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests which detect the virus – molecular tests, such as RT-PCR tests, that detect the virus's genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus."" The antibody test shows whether or not you have already had the virus and now have the antibodies for it. Antigen and antibody are not the same."
"I think it's best to get the PCR test. It's the airlines that err on the side of caution, regardless of how much or little the destination country cares about the test. They have to fly you home if you're denied entry."
