I have just returned from Lanta having contracted Dengue Fever! - Unfortunately there is no vacination against Dengue and suitable treatment is very limited. The fever is at epidemic proportions so please take care.
"Sorry to hear that. It is a major concern around the country right now, with another report of a rise in cases in Phuket yesterday. I wish you a full recovery."
"Thank you very much for your concern. Quite frankly, I have never felt so ill. My five year old daughter had a bad fever whilst in Lanta, fortunately, after blood tests it confirmed not to be Dengue. I started to feel ill in Bangkok two days after leaving Lanta. Hospital blood tests showed that I had a mild case of Dengue, god knows what a full blown case of Dengue would have felt like! - I really do not know if I would have survived! - Two weeks on I am still house bound and very weak. I would think twice about taking children again to Southern Thailand, the health risks associated with Dengue are far to high."
Unfortunately its not confined to southern Thailand but is rampant across all of SE Asia. In Thailand there are frequent reports from many provinces.
"I'm sorry for your illness .... hopefully your post will remind people to wear DEET/BugSpray/MozzieRepellant or whatever it is they'd like to call it during the DAY TIME when the Aedes mosquito which spreads Dengue likes to bite. Unfortunately most people who do not live in the tropics are used to mosquitos only biting during the evening/dusk hours and do not appropriately protect themselves during the rest of the day.I have read a lot of reports from Thai public health encouraging citizens to get rid of the mosquito breeding grounds -- hopefully people over there are listening! There are no vaccines to prevent against Dengue, but some extra effort of preventing infection (as well as further transmission -- wearing bug spray after you're already infected and still over there so you cannot spread it to another mosquito) can go a really long way to containing an epidemic."
Northern Australia also has Dengue and has for many years so it is not just confined to SE Asia. Most of us are used to using precautionary measures but it certainly doesnt hurt to remind people to avoid being bitten by mosquitos at all times.I certainly plan to pack plenty of DEET when we arrive in January. Sorry to hear about your bad luck IK123 and good luck with your recuperation. Remember to drink plenty of fluids. It will get better - eventually...
