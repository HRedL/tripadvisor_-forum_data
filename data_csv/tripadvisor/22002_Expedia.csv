I've never used them but there are dozens of threads on this forum which mention Expedia eghttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…Just do a search and change from relevance to date. Then book direct with the airline.
"Did you type Expedia into the search box just above your question? That should bring up all the topics on them to read. Some people like and use third-parties like Expedia, others have complaints and this forum has its fair share I prefer booking through the airlines own official website."
"Iv booked both flights and hotels with no problems, to Europe and USA.Edited: 2 years ago "
In my opinion adding any third party between yourself and the airline provides no added value to a straightforward flight booking particularly if you want to make changes after booking or if the airline has schedule changes.
"Book with the airline,as Tom has pointed out, it adds no value to put an extra layer of complexity into your travel arrangements.However its your decision."
"Thank you everybody.I usually do book direct with the airline, but all Avianca websites have a warning from my servers not to use a credit card on the site, as risk from hacking."
"I've not had any issues, and prefer to book all on one site so I know where everything is."
"http://www.avianca.com/us/en.htmlyou are getting warnings using the above website. StrangeThe issue with Expedia is that they are not like the other shonky companies and won't' do a bait and switch and if you make no mistakes, have no issues, flights are not changed etc then you may be fine. But dealing with customer service is when the issues start and that IMHO is not worth the hassleI don't get the logic of using one site so everything is there. I just don't there are enough travel itinerary sites to help consolidate travel plans so there is no advantage in booking on one site from a planning perspective -- some may find deals booking air and car and hotel together, howeverEdited: 2 years ago "
There are many advantages in using OTAs (third party - Online Travel Agents) - such as Expedia. I have had nothing but good experiences. On this forum you will see mainly complaints (nature of the forum... satisfied customers don't post).
I've used Expedia for hotel and flight packages many times in the past. However the last time (probably around 10 years ago) out included an easyJet flight and they didn't give me the details to check in on line in my confirmation or any where else. It was a bit of a faff having to get hold of someone to send me the details. I eventually got them.Now I would only use a third party for a complex itinerary that I could not book myself and I'd use a full service TA for that (e.g. Trailfinders)
"I have booked through Expedia many times and never experienced any hiccups until today. :( They somehow make it so easy to purchase services from them but when comes the time when you need to use them, it's a different story. We booked a trip back in November 2017, purchased travel insurance, seat selection, etc. Today I noticed our exact same trip is $100.00 each cheaper so I thought a simple call and they would offer us a price match. But that was not the case. According to a lady named Pia, they do not offer price match guarantees any longer. I then asked her if I could cancel and rebook as I have cancellation insurance. Her explanation was that there would be a $250.00 charge to cancel and I would then have to make a claim with the insurance company directly. This exchange between us went on for a bit and seeing that she could not help me, I ended our call. I then sent an email directly to Expedia to see if there was anything else they could do. Their immediate response was....We are experiencing extremely high email volume due to severe weather. We will do our best to respond to your email within 14 days. So I am going to sit and wait 14 days to see where this leads. Therefore I am neither bashing or bragging them just yet. I just want to see how customer service responds to my request."
Was there anything on their website or promotional material that led you to believe they would offer a price match. Or was it something that they'd done for you previously?
I do not recall specifically seeing promotional material at the time of booking offering price match guarantee but most companies do offer it. It makes for good customer service.
"Per the website, the price match ended as of October 18, and it doesn't sound like your situation qualified anyhow. For the price match it had to be within 24 hours. Travel prices fluctuate drastically. It wouldn't make sense for any company to match the price anytime a customer found a better price. Not only would the back-end and customer service logistics be daunting, we'd all just book right away and monitor and submit for a refund everytime the price lowered."
Have used Expedia in the past with no issues
Expedia is normally my go to website for long haul flights if they are same/cheaper than the airline as I get to collect some cashback. Never had problems.They price matched my hotel bookings some time back.
">>>Travel prices fluctuate drastically. It wouldn't make sense for any company to match the price anytime a customer found a better price.<<<My thoughts exactly. I can't see how it would be at all practical to price match flights. Such things seem to be as rare as the dod here in the UK, I wondered if things were different in Canada.We do have price match offers on hotels here, but in my experience they are very difficult to claim on."
"Expedia is a disorganized misleading organization, that tells lies about their pricing. When they record their calls and tell you that the prices fro the property you just booked at (By their own admission has changed) and that you would be refunded the difference, they try to make you go away by giving you a phony voucher not a refund, they have 'zero' price guarantee, and they are a complete scam. Myself and eight other associates will never use them again."
We've used them 3 times and found they are excellent. We book Business class flights and hotel and it is so much cheaper than any where else we have searched. In addition we use use quidco to book and get a lovely cashback bonus 3 months after we return.
Stay away!!!! Cancelled one of our direct flights for no reason. Emailed them 4 times to ask Why!!!!! Just returning the same email.been on the phone for 3 days on and off. Just leave you hanging on without solving the problem and leaving you with a massive phone bill stuck in Thailand Wtf !!!!
>> Cancelled one of our direct flights for no reason <<do you mean that the flight you were booked on is still operating as per your schedule but your booking on the flight has been cancelled?what is your route/date? If your original flight has been cancelled then the airline may have a re-accommodation policy to rebook. However since you did not book direct with the airline you are going to have to wait on your agent finding out what has happened and what the options are
"""Cancelled one of our direct flights for no reason.""Expedia cannot cancel flights."
"Booking with expedia, an airline had gone out of business and Expedia wasn't tracking. I was stranded at an airport midflight and the Expedia agents lied to me, promising a full refund when the itinerary was complete. I paid in cash to get on another flight (after Expedia told me there were no flights and wouldn't book anything). Upon my return they refused to refund me my money, and told me conflicting stories about how to pursue it. However, their receipt is not itemized so I cannot demonstrably state exactly the cost of that individual flight (there were several flights in the itinerary). I would strongly advise against using Expedia for anything more than price comparison."
"Expedia created travel Hell for my travel - put me in the worst travel nightmare any traveler can expected. I could't not checked in the flight that Expedia had assured me. I not only missed my plane andalso overstayed the visa in China! It's all because that Expedia staffs were so incompetent!! Expedia put me on a customer service hell that they put me over the phones for 7 hours and cost me over hundreds US$$$ of phone bill (I was on phone with Expedia from abroad)!The company staffs did not know what they were doing and their system did not work!!Here is the true story. I purchased a ticket from Expedia 1) 12/23/2017 Melbourne (Australia) - Guangzhou(China) 2) 1/1/2018 Guangzhou(China)- Los Angeles/Wahington DC (US)Because of my China travel document issue (my fault), I could not board the 1/23 flight from Melbourne to China. So I didn't take the 1st leg of my flight.When I called Expedia 12/23, Expedia staffs assured me over the phone and sent an email confirmation (upon my request) that the my flight from Guangzhou (China) to US on 1/1/2018 was good. I was also told that my 1st leg flight 12/23/2017 Melbourne (Australia) - Guangzhou(China) was cancelled. ==== So I trust the email from Expedia and what the staffs assured me and planned on leaving China on 9:30pm 1/1/2018.1/1/2018, I got to Guangzhou Airport to check in my flight to leave China. I was told by airline that they could not check me in!! What??...I couldn't believe knowing Expedia had sent me a confirmation email that my 1/1 flight was fine!!I was told by the airline to contact Expedia that I was not able to check in was because my 12/23 flight from Melbourne was still open and Expedia must cancel this leg before the airline could check me in.So started the customer support help with Expedia. I called Expedia ($0.35/min) immediately from the airport starting 7:47pm, the first Expedia customer staff was so incompetent and wasted over an hour and could't figure out what to do and the flight counter closed and I couldn't checked in my flight leaving China!!!I requested to talk to a supervisor. The Expedia supervisor said he had contacted the airline and could change my flight etc. But he never able to deliver. After another 1-2 hours on hold on phone. He left and passed me to another supervisor whom I had to explain everything again. She was even less competentand couldn't find the email Expedia sent me that assured my 1/1 flight (while the other two representatives were able to). So this incompetent Expedia staff put me on the phone till almost 3:30am next morning!!! They were all knowing I was on expensive long distance call talking to them for over 7 hours!!As the travel agent for its customer, Expedia was so incompetent. First they assured me my flight was good (with email proof). Then they could not give any clear help when I called them over 7 hours. Had they known what they were doing and could have given me a clear answer, I could have just booked another flight and would not have overstayed my visa in China!!! =============Because of their incompetence, 1) I could not get on my flight. Even worst, 2) I overstayed my visa since my 72 hours visa to China expired on 1/1. 3) I had to waste my valuable travel time talking to useless Expedia staffs. Over seven hours (hundreds of $$ wasted!! 4) I also missed my work in US by one day because of this delay.I had to buy a new ticket leaving China the next day eventually. With me overstaying my visa in China over one day, not sure what trouble I would get next time if I wanted to go to China.That's my Expedia story. Expedia is incompetent company with bad system and worst customer service!!"
"We find that Expedia can offer exceptional pricing on packages which bundle air and hotel. After booking, we confirm with the airline and hotel and deal with them directly for any schedule changes, seating issues, hotel room requests, etc. We do not expect Expedia to offer much service once your purchase is completed.Having said that, we have never had a problem with Expedia. In fact, we were notified several tines about airline schedule and equiptment changes by them, before we heard from the airline. This is important as you want to get ahead of other passengers if there is a problem and you need to find alternative arrangements.Booking air or hotel only? I use them for searching only...once you see a flight or hotel that appeals, book it directly with the provider and avoid the middleman (Expedia). It will likely be the same price, or in the case of the hotel, you know the prevailing rate, you may even be able to negotiate a better rate or free amenities."

"I booked a trip from the US to Brazil with expedia and got a message suggesting a protection plan, since unexpected things happen and they would cover me. It was a simple opt-in box.There was probably a link to terms and conditions, but not noticeable and not clear enough to the point I couldn't see it.Well, i had to change my flight because of visa issues and that's when I found out about the conditions: only in case of death/health or legal problems. The ""protection"" plan itself is very limited, yet communicated with such a misleading message that it gets close to a scam practice.Legally, they are right, because the T&Cs mention it, although it is not made clear to customers. expedia is legally correct, but under very sneaky, cheap, reckless practices.Not reliable at all. Plus, there are better websites to get deals, including Kayak.com"
I can’t see where that’s sneaky and reckless. They had T and C and you didn’t read them and maybe assumed you would be covered for everything that occurred. With any kind of insurance you need to carefully read it’s T and C and inclusions and exclusions before buying it.If you are about to tick a box saying you want their insurance protection plan then it may have been wise to keep looking a little bit longer for the T and C rather than just buying it. That’s probably the “reckless” aspect of this situation.
Never used them to book an airline ticket but have used them to book lodges and the like in remote areas where booking dirrctly with the party on line was difficult. Never had a problem with them.
"Expedia is my number 1 booking site for flights, hotels and cars. Sometimes, kayak or other sites have much better rates and I go with them. Most times I don’t have any issue, but it is not perfect. Once a hotel was over booked and the hotel sent us to a sister location without extra fees when we checked in. Another, I had to change my flight and talked to a rep which took the details. A few days later, I still did not find my new booking and called again to find out that nothing was done. They expedited my change request and I got confirmation within the hour. I believe they are reputable, but s*** happens and best to double check. They do list my previous booking all 10 years ago."
@28.You would be hard pressed to find ANY insurance policy that would pay out on a claim for cancellation/delay or reschedule due to Visa problems.It is an exclusion in most policies.Nothing to do with Expedia in particular.
"I purchased a hotel flight package to Cancun for myself and 2 children with Expedia. The morning of departure 3/21/18 the flight was canceled due to a snowstorm. Spirit Airlines refunded my money immediately. After three phone calls and 4 hours later, Expedia told me the hotel would not refund my $1300 and I only had 10 days to use the reservation credit. I explained that there were no flights going to Cancun in the next 48 hours. I had to go back to work and my children had to return to college on Monday . In desperation I asked them to move the reservation to the following day in hopes a flight would become available. I was then told that they could do that but I could no longer have my original 375 sq ft room and the only option left was a 1287 square foot room for $700 a night. My complaint is they did not offer me a comprable room or a reasonable amount of time to reschedule the trip. Also, when I first called from the airport they put me on hold for 15 minutes and hung up on me. The second time I called was an hour (which I was on hold most of the time) I was told Expedia could not reach the reservations employee at the hotel because they were at lunch and Expedia would return my call in 2 hours time. I explained that I could not wait two hours because I was trying to find a flight out. The third time I called Expedia that day I asked to speak to a supervisor at which time I was put on hold for 15 minutes and then 30 minutes. Needless to say, I never spoke to a supervisor. The entire time the customer service agents spoke as if they were robots, not a slight bit of compassion for a situation that was very stressful and frustrating."
"Teresa S - I understand your frustration. But, there was no snowstorm in Cancun. The hotel can only offer rooms that are available.This is why people purchase travel insurance."
"It wasn't your fault that you couldn't fly, but it wasn't the hotel's fault either. As R_Squared has rightly said, this is exactly the sort of thing that travel insurance is for."
"Most hotels now have a minimum of 24-hour advance notice to cancel a reservation and not be charged. However, if you are staying is a resort area like Cancun, the time frame can be much greater. I've even seen and stayed at places where it is 21 days in advance. Whenever you book a package, you need to be aware of all of the cancellation policies, not just for your flight. While it wasn't your fault, you can't expect a hotel to just refund the money if you missed the cancellation deadline. This is""prime time""in Cancun, with many US colleges and secondary schools are on vacation.Therefore room selection will be limited, if there's even any availability.However, if you talked to them prior to arriving, it does seem strange that you were told your original room type was unavailable, especially if you were going to be checking out on the same date (you didn't specify)."
Expedia by far is the WORST travel site I have every had the displeasure of using! the customer services HORRIBLE! They are very unwilling to help with problems that may arise and place me on hold for over an HOUR!!! EXPEDIA BLOWS!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I THIS CRAPPY SITE!Edited: 2 years ago 
Booking flights through Expedia was very easy. It was super easy to check in online with the information provided by Expedia.
"I have had no issues...in general the only complaints people have about them is when they take the mystery deal and then they are not happy with it. All in all, if you ever take one of thier special deals, read all the fine print, and make sure that works for you then buy. Most of the time you will get the same prices as airlines and hotels have on their own sites"
"Expedia UnreliableThinking of booking through Expedia for your travel? Think twice!!!I have a bad experience recently.We made a reservation and fully paid RM2,709.11 in November 2017 with Expedia for our Apartment in Tignes, France for our 7 nights stay on 17th to 24th March 2018. What was most shocking upon arrival at the Hotel, we were told that our booking did not exist. How is this possible? We have all the confirmation and records but were told it was non-existence.Thereafter, the Hotel put us in another sister’s Apartment while waiting for Expedia’s reply.After our 7 nights stay, the problem was never resolved. We have to incur an additional payment of RM6,269.82 (Euro 1,282.40) upon check out. After 2 weeks of waiting, they called and offered me a refund of RM2,709.11. WHAT A JOKE???Are they reliable?"

"Ellie, you have already posted this very long post on another thread about Expedia. It is not necessary to post the same thing on each thread."
"They made my travel plans hell. Arrived at airport at 6 am to take first of 3 legs to be told that the flight had been rescheduled to 5.15 pm therefore negating all connections. 3 hours on the phone to Expedia and the two airlines involved proved to be a complete waste of time with all parties blaming the others and no possibility of a refund. This has been ongoing now for nearly a week . Further calls to Expedia, promises of a resolution not forthcoming. I am $2,000.00 out of pocket, holiday ruined. Will contact my credit card company on return with this disgusting behavior from all concerned. NEVER AGAIN WITH EXPEDIA."
"I did not mention that I had to reschedule another viable route at a further cost of over $2,000 and arrived two days late at destination completely frazzled and missed the event that was the purpose of my trip."

"So it was not just the hotel having double booked, or sold the room for a higher price due to ""4 large events taking place in Stillwater this weekend"", and so they laid the blame on Expedia rather than confess to you while standing there in Reception? You are too gullible."

"""do you get paid per post""Yep. 20 points per post which I am saving up to use to buy the Expedia company."
"Christina,You have posted your review on the AIR TRAVEL forum, and the subject of your post has nothing to do with this forum."
"'My post was a REVIEW.' Was it? Except for this 'Expedia sent me a receipt, a confirmation, and a reminder that I had a reservation' it reads more as a complaint.'My review was based on my experience with Expedia's service.' There doesn't seem to be much of a review, again more disappointment with what happened.'No one can contradict what I experienced and the events that took place.' Indeed, because aside from posting that there was no booking when you arrived at the Hotel Unknown, you've provided no information about your 'experience with Expedia's service'.My post 48 included a response to post 43, also a complaint for the sake of it rather than asking a question, something along the lines of how to go about dealing with a third party booking website whose actions fall short of expectations."
"I use and like Expedia. It's certainly not one of the shady travel sites. I do use it most for hotel and car-rental bundles where I can usually save about $100 on a car rental. Although I use the site for price checking airline flights, I generally go to the airline's site specifically to book as I can select seats and also not have issues with the third party if there's a trouble with the flight."
"Good point, however in retrospect the check would have shown that the flight was as scheduled at 0700 hours. Change was made at the last minute, hence the other 10 passengers also with no idea of the change."
"*AVOID AT ALL COSTS*Quite possibly the worst company on the planet, they are giving online companies a very bad name. Look at their Trustpilot reviews before booking with them."
Have used Expedia many times and has always been absolutely fine.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Both times I have ever used them I have been charged twice for bookings. I have had to ring them up and sat on hold for up to 30 mins and then they have made excuses about it being a temporary hold for 72 hours, even though it was past 72 business hours. The customer service is a joke and extremely condescending when speaking to you as if the issue isn't a large one. I had one guy tell me calm down it'll come back. Would you be calm if you had lost $2,500 out of your bank account?! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND."
"I used to use Expedia a great deal. Then my daughter had a flight from Irkutsk to Moscow that was cancelled at the last minute due to a massive thunderstorm in Moscow. Lots of finagling happened to get her on a flight the next day (her visa was about to expire) and in the end she had to pay for the new flight. When she tried to get a refund for the original flight Expedia refused to refund her, so did the airline, and she spent hours on the phone speaking in both Russian and English and never got a dime back. It was actually my money so I picked up the baton. Not a cent was refunded by Expedia or the airline; each claimed the other was responsible, neither was terribly friendly about any of it. I'm out $375 and Expedia has lost a formerly regular customer."
Expedia can't refund you money if the airline has not refunded them. Why don't you blame the correct party?
"In my experience Expedia is the most misleading company that I have ever worked with! I spent hours online and on the phone three different times resulting in dropped calls, all on their end. Each time, a customer service rep took down all of my contact info and not once did they try to call back or reach me by email. Each time I called, the rep said they had no info on me in their computer??? After trying a fourth and fifth time on a ridiculous amount of time, I gave up! Don't waste your time with Expedia!"
Do not use their services. It is awful. I just got off a 3 hours phone call with my parents stranded on their way back from India. I lost $1800 on the booking. I lost time. My parents truly taken aback by the awful experience. Worth taking your business elsewhere.
the above comment is accurate. They just drop the call in the middle of the conversation.
"What happened, Nandini? How did you lose money? What did Expedia mess up for your parents?"
"""I just got off a 3 hours phone call with my parents stranded on their way back from India. I lost $1800 on the booking. I lost time. My parents truly taken aback by the awful experience.""There are very few circumstances were being stranded is something you would need to discuss with the agent you booked from."
I was told the wrong cancellation date and wasn’t sent a itinerary since they put in my email address wrong. They also didn’t not have the cancellation information for the hotel listed on the website so I called Expedia to get cancellation information and still was told the wrong information. I was held responsible for the cancellation charges for the hotel I booked. I put in a dispute and once I called back to check on it they could not find where a dispute was made and every time I called back I had a issue with them finding my hotel booking. The supervisor never investigated the issue even though I was told that she will call me back in a hour and I never receive call back!!! This place is a fraud!!!! Be careful!!! I will never use there services again!!!
"They suck, in my experience. I got taken advantage of twice in the same travel. They screwed me on a car rental reservation because their reservation process has no mechanism in place to remind you that you may be renting from a location far away from your airport. One can say it was my fault for not checking, and I own up to some of that. They also didn't back me up when Icelandair price gouged me for checked luggage on a return flight (for some reason, one checked back was covered only on an outbound flight).Good thing is that there's plenty of competition, and I closed my account with Expedia after a few years of using them without huge problems."
"After spending days traversing the various sites to find an affordable flight to a Caribbean destination, I saw what I thought was quite affordable being offered by Expedia. The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience.I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not- to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that. I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience.I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. IF EXPEDIA OR AIR CANADA WAS REALLY GENUINE ABOUT THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS/PASSENGERS WHY WAS I NOT OFFERED ONE OF THESE TRIPS. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF CUSTOMERS...THAT'S WHY."
"They are proper criminals...entice you with a great fare, then just before you are ready to go they change your itinerary to something quite inconvenient, probably hoping you will re-book at the higher fare. Downright disgusting"
"They are proper ""dodgy"" people. There must be some Consumer body to protect the rights of consumers, these people are getting away with what the common man would be ""brought to book"" for.Can you imagine. me getting into a contract with another party, the other party commits financially to it, then when I am to perform my end of the contract I renege. I would be sued for breach of contract. I think the same should apply to Expedia and Airlines that take people's money for a trip and then change it at the last minute at a terrible financial consequence to the passenger.It is downright dishonesty."
"Air Canada, ah, what a fantastic example of things going wrong when you are the only game in town! I've been burned by them more times than I can remember. You don't need to go far--just observe the artitide of their staff. Thankfully, I'm no longer in the position where I have to use Air Canada. In fact, I drive a sense of satisfaction when I avoid Air Canada as an option when I book my flights now."
"""The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not- to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that.""Because you are rebooked by a computer that simply moves you to the next available flight. I have been moved to impossible connections more times than I remember. In these cases you look for suitable alternatives and then request that the airline/agents rebooks you onto those. Your complaint really has nothing at all to do with Expedia."
"Tried to book flights from Sri Lanka to Canada using my Sri Lanka bank mastercard.Booking was not accepted because for some reason,Expedia didn't recognise the bank?????It is a large bank in Sri Lanka and no problem with funds in the a/c.Ridiculous............shan't bother with Expedia again."

Why not find the hotels reviews page and write a proper review. This topic you have posted in on this Air Travel forum is about Expedia.Click the magnifying glass icon at the top right of this page and search for the hotels exact name and location. Write your review there.
I have nothing but good reports for Expedia. Unfortunately I won't be using them for my next trip to Thailand because this year I can travel cheaper booking flights and hotel direct. For the last 2 years it was £1000+ less by booking through Expedia. My points have built up and I have just booked a hotel for 1 night free through my Expedia points (actual cost was £90). My only grumble is that we can only book a 26 night stay.
"17halwayne - you don't like Expedia and think they are crooks, but was it really necessary to write 3 posts about them within 30 minutes?Schedule changes are generated by the airline, not Expedia and like any 3rd-party site, they have no control over them. The exact same situation can occur when booking directly with the airline. Schedules change and routes are both eliminated and added all of the time. We once had a flight from Brussels eliminated from the schedule and ended up with a 6-hour layover in ORD. It happens. The airlines will only try to accommodate you on another flight in the same fare class that you originally booked in. If seats in your fare class are not available on a particular itinerary, they will try to find one with available seats. If the only one still available is with a long layover, you can either accept it or decline. If you decline the airline's offer and select an itinerary that involves a higher fare category, it's not unusual for the airline to expect you to pay the fare difference. You will not get compensated for ""inconvenience"" . In the future you need to familiarize yourself with the T+C's of your ticket before purchasing. Also with 3rd-party sites, the prices displayed may not be ""live"" prices.Your rant has nothing to do with Expedia, as it is Air Canada that made the change."
"Expedia customer service is horrible. Over a 2 week period tried to make a simple change to a reservation. Despite numerous assurances, they never got it right. I will never use them again!"
"We have had good luck in the past, but currently dealing with a nightmare. We booked business class tickets to Europe for 4 people, got a confirmation number from Delta and proceeded to book the rest of our trip. Apparently, the Delta confirmation did not mean anything and now they want an additional $12,000 for the same tickets. With numerous phone calls, we finally convinced Expedia to cancel the hotel that was part of this ""package."" (Not really a package if you don't include the flight.)"
Bad service and steeling from my debit card 200 pound not as they informed me on phone that the cost is 120 pound..
I have abooking through Expedia for Vietnam airlines that has a small name change required and Expedia say it can not be done - however the airline when I called said it could and easily.......I am waiting now for the Expedia response.

These is the worst and most incompetent booking Agency. 5 hrs to book a flight and they ended up not booking the flight. A waste of time and money and my funds where held up. Never never use them as the Customer service is in Cairo
"We planned a 15 day trip of a lifetime, abroad. 5 days before the trip we had a medical emergency . Sadly, we had to cancel. I immediately called EXPEDIA to help us cancel our international flights, hotel and excursions. They assisted me and said that they would and plea our last minute case. Expedia emailed me 2 days later saying the hotel had denied our request for cancellation. I decided to contact the hotel directly and throw ourselves at their mercy( we somehow failed to purchase travers insurance) and they assured us they would cancel our reservations and refund our money AND that EXPEDIA never cancelled our reservation with them. I will never use EXPEDIA again I strongly suggest you don’t either."
It's hardly Expedia's job to provide you with free travel insurance!
I agree! I did note “we” somehow failed to purchase insurance for our hotel.
Which is ultimately the cause of your issues.
"I’ll tell you what you obviously need to hear.. yes, WE failed to purchase hotel insurance. The fact still remains Expedia never contacted the hotel( they said they would). You can move on now.. I’m done.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I bought recently 2 international tickets. A few minutes later I realize I have to change the return since I was able to spend more time in my trip.., so I requested a change that according to what they publish when buying the tickets was ok if you change within 24 hours.I call them and the person who took my call confirmed I could change at no cost the return date. She proceeds to the changes by canceling the initial tickets and making new ones.Everything was fine until some days later I got double charged in my credit card. Surprise!!, the airline does not accept changes. Expedia will not take responsibility. I did a lot of calls to my bank, Expedia, and Avianca Airlines. Nobody took responsibility. They don't care what documentation you have, what proof you have, they simply said I can do nothing about it. You have to pay.So I have to pay 4 tickets for my trip when I used only 2. Yes, I was double charged and I have to pay myself. I have spent an important amount of money and time to solve the issue without success. I NEVER ever will buy through Expedia again. And I do not recommend Expedia."
"something does not add up. If you canceled the ticket within 24 hours, then given you did not book directly Expedia may have 2 transactions against your account -- two auths and one should go after a few daysIf you have proof that an agent made that change I don't see why you have to pay twice.Edited: 2 years ago "
Have you tried getting help from your credit card provider.
"I am surprised that the person would have allegedly cancelled your first tickets just to make a change to the return date. I had to do that once and they simply used the original outbound flight and changed the return. There was no cancellation of the tickets, as I retained the same PNR. Of course I was working directly with the airline, so perhaps that explains the difference. I never book flights thru a 3rd-party, as if there is an issue. it is much more complicated to have things resolved."
HORRID! We booked a car service through them for our early arrival in Paris. I was traveling with my sister and a young child. Upon arrival we got through customs and no car for us. We waited one hour. Tried calling - no answer. My granddaughter was tired and hungry so we just grabbed a cab. The train service was on strike so traffic was horrid. Car service was due at 7am. They finally called us back at 9:20 and asked where WE were? We told them we were in a cab. Called expedia - they refused to give us back our money - $140.00! Great service EXPEDIA! DO NOT USE EXPEDIA
"I signed up with Expedia yesterday and tried to purchase a business class flight/hotel bundle. The charge (or a partial one) went through on my credit card), then they canceled my reservation.No reason given. I called their help desk, who said some other department would contact me.In the interim, I contacted my bank to make sure there was no problem with the card itself, and I was assured it was all ok.I finally did get emails from Expedia, but with no explanation of what happened, only that the reservation had been canceled. Despite repeated requests they would not tell me the problem. I finally got an email where they not only said said they wouuldn't help me any further, but I wouldn't be allowed to make reservations on their site. Currently I am going to write a letter (and attach all the emails) and I will FedEx the package to their CEO of Consumers in the United States to see if I can get a response as to why they seemingly discriminated against me for no reason."
"It can make booking two one-way trips on different airlines easier when that is a cheaper option than booking a round trip on a single airline. HOWEVER, getting them to fix an error is a test of patience. I recently booked a round trip flight from SC to TX. It was cheaper to fly American to TX and Delta back to SC. I booked first class tickets but Expedia had me in coach on the leg from SAT to ATL. I talked to eight different Expedia reps over three different calls. They finally expedited me to a higher level rep who said that they made the error and he got me a first class seat. That call lasted 1 hour and 5 minutes."
"We had a wonderful trip and Expedia almost ruined it for us. We booked our 25th anniversary airline tickets to Italy through Expedia. I noticed that I left the letter ""l"" off my son's last name ""Williams"" accidently when I booked the airline tickets, so called Expedia to change it. Expedia not only shifted us from person to person, but had us on hold for almost 1 hr. They said there was nothing we could do and not to contact United Airlines since we booked through Expedia, they said the airline would not talk to us. We talked to 2 managers, who were not only super unwilling to give us any suggestions on how to fix the problem, but were almost patronizing. They kept saying there was nothing they could do and that we made the mistake. We would have to cancel the misspelled ticket seat with no refund and purchase a new one for over 2k, but then they said there were no seats left. What??? If I'm cancelling his ticket, wouldn't THAT EMPTY SEAT be available?!! It almost felt like they were enjoying this tortuous process they were putting us through. While on hold for the 4th time, on the other line we called United Airlines directly and United not only were happy to talk to us, but made a note on our ticket about the missing ""l"" and said it wouldn't be a problem. If we had listened to Expedia, our dream 25th anniversary vacation would have been ruined. So thankful for the real human connection we experienced at United Airlines. We will never use Expedia again."
All because you misspelt your sons name?
"I have used Expedia many times and have not had a problem. I usually also book my UK hotels through them if they are cheaper and get Nectar points, Expedia points and a small amount of cashback because I also go through Quidco. (Actually it was over £300 cash back last year). I also had a free hotel night through my Expedia points. Booking my flight this time I found a 5% voucher if I booked online directly through Emirates, so my flights were slightly cheaper. When my electronic tickets were sent through minutes after booking, I saw that both tickets were in my name. I contacted Emirates immediately and spoke to a very helpful young man. 2 weeks later I had not heard from Emirates so I went onto their chat line. I was reassured that the amendment was on file and not to worry, the change would be made and sent to me. 1 week later I received the amended ticket. Absolutely wonderful service. I think I will still use Expedia, especially for UK hotels but after reading the comments here, I wonder if I would have had such good service in getting an amendment."
"Expedia plays tricks with luggage: before paying they say that one suitcase of up to 23kg is included in the price. Right after payment they say that registered baggage is an extra, an unspecifed amount to be paid additional to the ticket.Anything but honest. Companies probably know that with a ticket bought through Expedia, a supplement can or must be charged, hence unpleasant situations, conflicts at registering. Opodo seems to be a more straightforward site."
Experia. . .Opodo. Out of the frying pan into the fire!
"Thomas, have you not thought about booking directly with the airline?"

"Almost always used Expedia for many years. Now , i don't see why i would book through them. more money, not as many options. Figure out your own trip - Expedia is not the site that will make your trip ."
"When booking a package thru any 3rd party like Expedia, make sure you know the T&C's are, particularly with making changes to your reservations or canceling. Many hotels and even car rental firms will now give you cheaper rates if you book & pay in advance and do not allow changes or cancellations. These are the rates the package may include. A poster awhile back arrived the day after he was scheduled to due to a flight issue and found out that the car he reserved thru a pkg. had been pre-paid and when he didn't show, the reservation was cancelled and no refunds. He had to rent another car and pay separately. Another problem is that the airfare being booked is in Basic Economy for many routes and that means no advance seat assignments and depending on the airline, may not allow you to bring anything but a small personal item on board."
"Basic Economy fares are called out pretty clearly, and yes, they don't include much!"
"<<Basic Economy fares are called out pretty clearly>> but an amazing amount of people seem to miss this when booking or simply don't understand them and then come here and complain. Best to ask about what class the airfares are before hitting the ""Buy"" button."

"DONT use expedia!!!We booked $7000 worth of flights through them, received confirmation booked and paid, then they call the following evening to say that it wasn't booked as there was a problem with the payment. Tried to get me to pay again multiple times, but I called the bank and the bank said they have sent the money. They then cancel all the flights. Over 6 hours call time too many different people there they still have not refunded the money."
"Terrible, worst experience ever. Bad customer service and they charge you and then there's no ticket, and trying to get your money back takes forever and hours of phone calls plus they keep your money for a week"

"You've made three posts Jija, and you've not articulated what your issue is. Hardly helpful to anyone reading the forums."
"EXPEDIA NOT EVER! Never book with them, I booked to Europe (the flight was with Iberia). To solve my issue; EXPEDIA said that IBERIA is the one able to do it, and IBERIA refers me to EXPEDIA to resolved it. Creating a never ending loop of unhelpful service! At the end none of them provided a solution. Only very happy to take your money.Both companies were incredibly feckless, You make the payment through one them but the money is took from your bank by the other one, So the PERFECT TRICK for their poppycock excuses."
Next time buy directly from the airline. We tell that to everybody here. People still get sucked in by the promise of saving a couple dollars and they don't realize the risk they take on.
"Thank you to all for the good advice and recommendations, I will book directly with the airline next time.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Do not use EXPEDIAThey are not part of ABTA (which means no come back or arbitration)I selected Hotel + Flights button on their website. I selected my hotel and then the times for the flights. Only one problem, the flights do not take me to the island the hotel is on!!! They think this is acceptable and will not refund our money or change/alter the flights. Believe me I have tried . . . .Advice: book using a credit card so you can get help if they don't provide the service described, but look at the reviews on internet - lots of people complaining not just me. Use someone else."
So did you book the wrong flight on line or was it over the phone? and expedia messed up .If it was your fault then the chances are the fare is a non changeable ticket and you will have to bear the cost of a new ticket to the correct destination.
"""I selected my hotel and then the times for the flights. Only one problem, the flights do not take me to the island the hotel is on!!!""And yet you still booked the package? That is your fault, not Expedia's"
"EXPEDIA = EXPEDITE FRAUDDear Editor - we have recently experienced a most vexsome and distressing interaction with a car rental in Chile through Expedia.First, they incorrectly coded the car we received from a standard 4WD SUV to compact SUV we took when we arrived.We had already paid Expedia $443.23 but were given a contract for our car showing the total charge of $341.53USD.After several rounds of emails to the Expedia “Gold Team”, we have received the following list of explanations, none of which are satisfying and/or truthful:1. Jennifer wrote that Expedia “negotiated” the best price available at the time. Possibly true but not for the class of vehicle we received. …… we persisted…2. Keith then wrote that some customer service person stated that we were quoted Pounds instead of USD and thus the difference. A true lie as our receipt clearly states 205740.00 Chilean pesos or $341.53 USD. We pointed that out and that tactic was forgotten…. Finally 3. May wrote that “there has been a miscommunication on the part of the car company” and we were charged the rental fee PLUS a “facilitation fee to compensate for services”. Thus a $101.70 commission on $433 of false charges …. is that outrageous?4. May again saying that they would forward my complaint to management team so “this will never happen again”. WOW! How about now!The lessons learned: certainly never use Expedia for any purpose and never allow any company to take money in advance of services received. We can now only hope that our Citibank card will rectify this mess and provide proper restitution."
"Terrible customer service. A flight I booked was cancelled and despite that flight costing a minimum of over $200, only $32 was refunded. The customer service did not help me find a solution (I ended up taking a bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka for over $200). All messages from the service team were generic, unhelpful, and written as though it was the last word. They made no attempt to help me in any way. I suspect the refund was so low since they deducted fees from the true cost of the flight (no flight from Tokyo to Osaka would ever cost $32). I do not recommend that you use this company."
""" The customer service did not help me find a solution (I ended up taking a bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka for over $200). "" - Ooooh... rookie mistake. Read rhe terms and conditions and you will find that you don't get to make the booking yourself if a flight is canceled. That is up to the *airline*, not you or Expedia. You should have contacted the airline first, not Expedia.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Third-party agent.What could possibly go wrong?Best of luck next time,Hunt"
"'A flight I booked was cancelled and despite that flight costing a minimum of over $200, only $32 was refunded. <snip> I suspect the refund was so low since they deducted fees from the true cost of the flight (no flight from Tokyo to Osaka would ever cost $32).'Your suspicion is likely incorrect. Although the airline would have worked with you to find another flight after the first was cancelled, since you chose not to fly at all then in essence you would have cancelled the ticket. If Expedia had booked nonrefundable ticket you would have been eligible to receive some taxes and fees, less Expedia's fee for processing the refund. As Geo said, you should have contacted the airline rather than the agent.Re post 124, what is included in Basic Economy fares varies from airline to airline. The carriers' websites will have the most up to date information and should be consulted before booking any BE fare."
"Hmm, our resident trolls are off today and so I read this whole thread.I have been with expedia a few years after its inception. I never had a problem with them (didn't know then that booking directly with the airlines was a safer alternative) booking airfares, hotels, packages. I just read everything and double check everything. Got some really good prices on expedia.Don't understand why people have problems with it when mostly it is due to their not being careful inputting their data or reading carefully what's in front of them. And oh, the overriding thing I observe is that those with complaints usually have very few posts to their credit and usually are first time posters. None ever said that they ask first about something before booking. Grow up and take responsibility. It is not always the other side's fault."

"Even when using the best of agents there can be complications.Took me hours to buy an additional bag allowances with VA because it had been booked via Trailfinders. Couldn’t add it online as it was an agent booking. Agent said they couldn’t add it either. Then the airline said speak to the agent, we can’t help you. Went around this loop again before eventually a VA supervisor agreed to organise the extra bag for the 3 flights. (Advance purchase was 50% less than paying at the airport)So I just book direct now. So much simpler and quicker if you need to change something. No hanging about waiting for someone to call you back"
"I have an ongoing issue. Booked a flight to Tallinn from Vilnius . then LOT cancels. Expedia contacts me and we book on the evening flight. Then I get an email from Expedia ( no warning) that that is cancelled.LOT's site clearly shows that flight available. Contacted Expedia twice, seems to be rocket science for them to see what happened. Still waiting for refund if i get it ( airline cancelled not me). I booked my self on anther airline as obviously Expedia is not interested. never had a bad experience til now"
The worst nobody could be as bad as Expedia. They changed our flight and never told us. When we arrived at airport the flight was oversold and our seats were gone. They did NOTHING NOT A THING. After 6 hours on the phone the said if we paid $1800.00 they would get us flight home 4 days later. They also said we had to pay the hotel. We ended up flyinng home with tickets we purchased from Southwest and rental car. I would walk and swim before I would use Epedia.
"They should not be allowed to sell tickets, no support, The worst folks I have ever dealt with, no people in USA, only in call centers in Turkey and Philippines. They are a joke."
How about edreams or opodo or kiwi ? Are they better than ExpediaWhy did you book with them ? Why not check in for flight 24 hours prior or keep tabs via the airline app on the flightThey are a joke ? So what does the country the agents come from have to do with that ? Are you being Racist ? Shame on youEdited: 1 year ago 
"Everything seems racist these days to some people , the fact that you cannot communicate clearly with someone and that they do not have ANY agents period in the country you are traveling to might be helpful information for people getting ready to travel using Expedia. I would say book directly with the airlines they are providing the service not Expedia. Expedia told us after 6 hours on the phone they could get us tickets home in four days and it would cost us $986.00 per ticket. Some people might consider that a joke."
"I see you have made over 60,000 post , I have made 3 ever, this is the first on-line review I have ever made that is how BAD EXPEDIA is."
"Hah to file with AG Washington to get money back, service just AWFUL!!!"
"Not Expedia specifically but if you wanted input about 3rd parties: I booked our resort through Airmiles. Through this 3rd party relationship, I was able to pay in Canadian dollars and avoid exchange fees (rather than paying in USD), and I received Airmiles. Their cancellation policy is also very generous.I did need information from the resort itself (Disney), which was the resort confirmation number, so I can go ahead and make reservations for on-site services and attractions. Airmiles was very prompt about calling their supplier and getting that information to me. For this reason, I recommend working with a 3rd party. However, if I wanted to add on certain features, ie. create a vacation package, I would have to do that either directly with Disney or with a travel agent.I say, to each his own, you just need to know what you are committing to.Edited: 1 year ago "
"don't use expedia for anything , completely unhelpful"
"A really informative first post! Poster if you want your post to be taken seriously you’d give more detail, at present it’s useless.Edited: 1 year ago "
"First of all, Expedia owns Travelocity, Orbitz, and Hotwire to name a few. I became a member of Expedia years ago when their practices were somewhat more legit. Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and Hotwire now engages in false advertising where they post a pruce, but when you make your selections and attempt to book it says ""Oops, we hate when this happens, but the price of your trip has increased from $625 to $850"" Recently I shopped for a trip to Mexico and this exact thing happened...the trip increased $200 ($625 to $825) at booking and they STILL have the advertised rate of $625 2 days later. Their intent is to sucker you in at a low rate and create panic that the rate is going sky high to make you bite on the $200 increase. This advertising is illegal and i am looking into the correct governmental agency to file a complaint with. When you speak with somebody in customer service, they hold the fraudulant company line by saying ""We are sorry, but prices do fluctuate"" This may be true, but don't advertise a rate for days that you know will change upon booking"
"often ""unhelpful"" translates to ""I want to do break the contract and don't want the terms and conditions I agreed to, to apply"""
"Avid, I'm confident you won't be the first to complain about these practices to a government department. I'm also confident that the result of your complaint will be the same as happened after the previous ones. Nothing will change."
"Horrible overall experience. Booked a MULTIPLE DESTINATION trip from London to Karachi and Doha and back to London. My ticket provided by Expedia clearly mentioned both the destinations (Karachi and Doha). On my way from Karachi to Doha I see that I am booked directly from Karachi to London. Upon asking the airline, I am clearly told that my ticket doesn't have Doha as a destination. Once I reach back I complain to the airline and they clearly tell me that they dont have any record of a MULTIPLE DESTINATION booking. I have been complaining to Expedia ([REQ:M-23631478]) and three times I have received phone calls from their incompetent customer service representatives who at times don't even know how to read an itinerary and they just tell me that I should contact the airline. No respite. I am planning to make formal complaints to the regulatory authorities."
#148What routing was printed on your travel confirmation documents fro Expedia?London > Doha > Karachi > Doha > London - or -London > Doha > Karachi > London?
"T_U, I read it as neither of those options, ha. It seemed like the trip should have been London->Karachi->Doha->London, but when they got the tickets it’s simply a round trip to Karachi cutting out Doha completely."
"Since you ask sure I will share my travel moments...Shame on you Expedia. Booked through Expedia flights, transfers and hotel from Hong Kong to Shengdu China for 4 days Easter holiday 2019. All payed and double confirmed with emails. Arrived at the airport the airline (HK Airlines) didn’t have my flight booking!.How can this happen? Everything was payed and confirmed by both Expedia and the Airline. I phoned Expedia they kept me on the phone for more than 1 hour, no solution nor explanation given. Flight eventually got full and I was left stranded on the airport. Was given an alternative flight via Singapore the following morning which was totally unacceptable as my holiday was already 1 day shorter. Expedia promised to contact me within 24 hours to explain the matter. They didn’t. For the next week I kept phoning them for my refund and compensation with no luck. They would put me on hold, different people always on the phone promising to phone me the next day which they didn’t. The worst customer service ever. On top of that I keep receiving emails from different Expedia customer service personnel telling me they ve been trying to phone me but They couldn’t get through. I found that bizarre as I received no missed calls and my phone works just fine. All their emails btw you couldn’t reply to, all signed by just a first name like Sanjay with no direct number to get hold of them back. They will only prompt you to phone the general customer service where once you phoned and gave them your details no one knew who was the person sending me the emails and none knew about my situation. So every time I had to explain my story from the start.After a week still no full refund Nor compensation.I am currently seeking legal advice. This company is irresponsible and should be closed down."
"Dkevgas, did you at any point confirm your booking with the airline ahead of time (call, or check on the airline website)? Next time save yourself the hassle and book directly with the airline."
"Further to a recent booking, due to family reasons we have had to change the flight times of our booking. We rang Expedia this morning to ask for the dates of our flight times to be changed and were horrified to be told that it would cost us £220 to change. We found flights that were substantially cheaper than the penalties Expedia were charging us. We are extremely angry and upset after having used Expedia in the past and giving plenty of time before the revised flight to be ripped off in this fashion. We will never use Expedia again as not only losing our money for the original flight we have had to pay again for the new flights albeit cheaper than the penalties that Expedia were asking for.What appalling service"
the change fees are part of the airline fare rules. Sometimes the costs for changing tickets can be more than chucking the ticket and purchasing a new one....not uncommon and nothing related to who you purchased the ticket from. The same would have happened had you booked the same ticket type direct with the airlineWhat were the airline rules regarding changes? (you would have been able to review them before you selected the flight)
"You aren't being ripped off. The pric eis what it is, and will be based on the fare difference, plus an admin fee from the airline, and on top of that any additional fees that Expedia charge for doing this for you.As Carol says, it's not that unusual to discover that it's cheaper to just buy a new ticket than to change an existing. If you never use Expedia again it's not something that bothers me, but please be aware that you could find yourself in the same situation again even if you avoid them.The truth is that if you want to make changes you are almost always going to have to pay more, and very possibly a lot more. Unless you buy fully flexible tickets at great expense, it's a fact of life, sorry."
"Agree with the previous two responses. Except for fully flexible tickets, there will be a change fee associated with anything you want to change on your tickets - date, times, names. You should make yourself aware of this prior to buying any tickets. It is unfortunately when circumstances appear after one has bought tickets that require the original arrangements to no longer be suitable, but that is the risk you take when buying cheaper fares. While Expedia may have been charging some sort of admin fee, the bulk of the cost for changing will come from the airlines (all information on change fees appear on airline websites) and any difference in fare.You can swear off using Expedia, but eventually you will find that all airlines will have change fees and so will other third parties. It's just that third parties can also tack on additional fees over and above what the airlines charge. Sorry, but your complaint about being ripped off has no validity."
Pathetic and appalling service. Expedia did not inform us of cancelled Air Malta flights from Southend airport.  We arrived airport and there were no flights and had to buy new tickets at 1000% of initial cosrt. Will never ever use Expedia again. Really pathetic and poor service
Wedding Guest - that's really too bad. I'm sorry you had such a terrible last minute surprise at the airport. This is an important lesson on 1) cutting out the middle person and book directly with the airline and 2) confirming/checking up on your flight reservation from time to time before your trip.
"Yes, it is too bad you had this experience, but after making your reservations, did you never check on your flight prior to going to the airport? There are often schedule changes, even very close to the departure date, which can affect your flight departure times, result in you being re-routed, or yes, even flight cancellations. You don't mention what airline you were flying but was there no OLCI process (usually 24 hours prior to departure) to use that would have alerted you to the flight cancellation when you tried to check in?Yet another first poster who just joined to post a complaint. There seems to be an epidemic."
"I think it's wise to keep an eye on flights even though I book direct. It's doubly wise to do so if you use a third party, even if it's not one of the well known shonkies."
We called Expedia 3 days prior to departure date just to verify that travel plan is as per scheduled. And guess what? They affirmed that nothing’s changed. Shocked and disappointed on getting to airport and there were no flights.
"Quite surprise that this trend is still being discussed. Probably, I would also add on then.I used Expedia on many occasions to book my trips but they aren't the best in price for air tickets honestly. I had several encounters where I was redirected to Expedia from Skyscanner, Expedia system claimed that the fare was no longer available and the ticket cost like $100 more.As for the hotels, sometimes there are pretty good deals. But always compare to other sites such as Agoda and Booking.com. The confirmation comes down very quickly and I had no issue when checking in at the airport nor the hotels."
"Wedding Guest - why would you call Expedia 3 days in advance to verify you flights rather than the airline you were flying on (Air Malta)? Expedia has no control over what the airlines do, they simply book tickets. IMO like most 3rd-party vendors, they really don't care much once they have gotten your money. A lot could have happened in the 3 days after you called that resulted in the cancellation of your flights. It can occur right up to and even after the scheduled departure time, so it is entirely possible that Expedia was never notified of any cancellation. It is always better to verify flights and any hotel arrangement directly with the airlines and hotels you will be using, rather than with whatever 3rd-party vendor you booked thru."
It was a mistake to ring Expedia rather than check your flight and booking online with the carrier.
"I am having nothing but a nightmare right now...I am on the phone with Expedia.ca for the 2nd day in a row. We have a credit and i'm trying to re-book. When I called months ago the lovely agent told me that I could redeem this as long as Latam Air was one of our connecting flights. This is not the case now...apparently. For two days I have been trying to book a flight and redeem our credit. Now their supervisor Sam is arguing with me on the phone basically telling me that if I pay $500 more I will get to my destination 2 days after my flight takes off....but that is a great deal. He also told me that he was ""looking for 20 minutes for a great flight"" but then left me on hold for an hour and a half?? Then he insulted me by telling me that I basically do not know how to read. and now I am on hold for another 30 minutes because that is the only option I have if I wish to speak to a Manager...is to sit and wait. I spent extra money to buy flight insurance and thought I did everything right. Expedia is great at taking your money but when it comes to actually crediting you and trying to help you without making you pay more...they turn into A-holes. I will NEVER book through them again. There are better websites to book though. Am I going crazy...or has anyone else had a horrible experience with Expedia. #expediayousuck"
"“There are better websites to book though.”Every airline has its own website and I’ve always found it very pretty simple to book directly! Seriously, Expedia is one of the more legit third party middleman (would never lump them in with the shonky/shoddy lot), but you’re finding out what happens when you place a middleman between you and the airlines. Book direct and so many of these issues will disappear."
I think that when trying to use an airline credit it only exacerbates the difficulties that always exist when going through a middleman.
"I had an unpleasant experience with Expedia. We booked flight + hotel to Mallorca and took the car hire option that Expedia offered. The hotel and flight was ok. We arrived at Palma airport and tried to follow the instructions on the booking. The car hire company was RecordGo but the instructions told us to wait in a certain meeting point to be greeted by someone from another company. However, it was impossible to find the meeting point. We asked RecorGo, they were also surprised. In the end asked one of the information desks and the guy told us that those instructions were not for Palma airport but for the Canary Islands and the person we were supposed to meet was from a company that no longer existed in Palma. After spending some time to find this out, we started the picking up process with RecordGo. They offered us several options for insurance but our booking already included one! It was written explicitly on the booking that insurance was included. However the company could not apply it because there was no insurance number on the booking. We called expedia hoping that they would provide us with the insurance number. But what was their response? ""You paid very little for the rental anyway"". Well, we took an offer that came from them! I did nit negotiate to pay less. It is not my fault that it was affordable. In the end, we had to forget about expedia and find a solution. Three options: pay 1200 euro deposit, pay 69 euro full insurance or do not pick up the car at all. We paid the 69 not to lose any time any more. We spent more than two hours of our day and it was the beginning of a vacation!I don't think I will use expedia again."
"@Aggowl, I don't think that is the case all the time. If Expedia books the tickets then you must often deal with them to make the changes. I book extensively with both the airlines directly and, sometimes, with Expedia. There are cases when the airline will tell me that I must handle any changes with Expedia because they made the booking. Of course, Expedia and I are subject to the change fees, conditions, etc. from the airline."
"I, too, do a great deal of trips through Expedia and, with one or two minor exceptions, have never had a problem with them. There are a lot of warnings about online travel agents (OTAs), however, Expedia does not fall into the same group of Kiwi, etc. which should be avoided at all costs. Expedia customer service is very good. However, to follow up on some of the other points, I have had several times where I have booked through Expedia to be told later by the airlines that because the booking was done through Expedia and not through the airline directly, the airline cannot handle changes and I have to go back to Expedia, who sort out the changes."
"I just returned from a trip to Europe that required different arrival cities and departure cities and Expedia offered the best deals but they don’t do anything with the airlines when it comes to seat reservations which cost additionally and even though all my passport info etc was included with the original booking, the return flight didn’t have any of it in the system. We flew into the United Kingdom from Texas and then returned by way of Madrid, Spain. The booking said the return flight was Iberia which was operated by American Airlines but we went to check in at Iberia they told us to go to American Airlines. Why even bother having Iberia mentioned in the booking when they have nothing to do with the actual flight? Most confusing and it was an added delay and frustration. Also American Airlines didn’t put any of our passport info into the system so we arrived back in the states there was more delays because they had chase all that info. I will never use Expedia again for booking flights. You might save a little bit of money but the lack of comprehensive information is ridiculous."
"Hi taavimark, hopefully you had a nice trip otherwise.""Why even bother having Iberia mentioned in the booking when they have nothing to do with the actual flight"" -- That is common for code share flights. It sounds like it was ticketed via Iberia but operated by American which is a partner airline. It may have been cheaper ticketed via Iberia than via American. ""Also American Airlines didn’t put any of our passport info into the system so we arrived back in the states there was more delays because they had chase all that info"" -- I'm a little confused. What problems did you have when you arrived back in the US? If your passport info wasn't put into the system, that would've prevented you from boarding the flight in the first place.As you noticed, booking directly with the airline involved can remove some of the indirection you might experience with third party travel sites. Next time look at booking directly."
"SCAMMED! Bait and switch scheme.Booked a hotel through Expedia 6mo ago; 24h prior to arrival, hotel tells us the room is no longer available and found us a subpar space for almost same price as original. We thought Expedia would help us find another hotel, but Expedia tells me they have to “wait to hear back” from original hotel before they can move forward with finding us a new hotel. Expedia expects us to wait till morning of arrival in a foreign city to find me a hotel, “because they haven’t heard back from original hotel”. They probably want to make sure the money is refunded to them before finding us a new hotel. Expedia is NOT on your side as a customer, you are at their mercy."
"I have read ALL of these posts and not one of them has indicated the issue is REALLY with Expedia and NOT the airline or provider. Every Issue I have seen could have occurred even if you had booked directly with the Airline or Hotel. They are terms and conditions of the provider, not Expedia.Expedia has ALL of the terms and conditions listed at the time you book with them and they are passing these on to the buyer the same as the provider would. ALL of the issues I have seen are related to terms of the Airline or hotel, not Expedia. To expect Expedia to solve that for you or not make one abide by them is ridiculous. Simply put, even when booked through Expedia. ANY and ALL updates or changes can be confirmed, communicated and dealt with DIRECTLY through the airline or hotel. A CANCELLATION may need to go through Expedia. I HAVE DONE IT DOZENS OF TIMES. Your Contract Of Carriage and payment with the Airline is directly with and to the Airline, not Expedia. Within 24 hrs of Expedia's confirmation I can find the Airline Conf # and go to the Airline website and look at the schedule, flight numbers and seating, change, confirm or upgrade them (for a cost).I just booked a week for 6 in the Caribbean as a package. The package price on Expedia was less than the ROOM ONLY, booked directly with the hotel, so essentially the airfare was free. I also received enough reward points to cover the cost of one airfare for another trip next month or to purchase a ""Coupon"" for an additional discount on a similar package of another 7% after the package discount.If that is not significant, book directly with the Airline and Hotel. You will have paid more and when there is an issue, your experience will be the same.I have NEVER expected ANY travel agent to hold my hand through my trip after booking. AND, Expedia is a BOOKING ENGINE not a travel agent.. The cost savings is significant if you can deal with the reality of the risk to travel and don't expect someone else to do it for you."
"Just a heads up to those who contemplating the higher fare option on Expedia that (supposedly) includes seat selection and one checked bag. I just booked a RT flight to Europe opting to pay the $120 extra proposed by Expedia so that I could select my seats ahead of time. The receipt clearly indicated that both seat choice and 1 checked bag were ""included"". These two items do *not* appear in the column marked ""Fee applies"". As instructed, I selected my standard seats on the American Airlines site for 3 of the 6 legs. However, the site redirected me to British Airways for the 3 remaining legs of the trip where a fee was required in order to select my seats. Several phone calls to each airline and Expedia have yet to resolve this issue. I presume that I will end up paying the extra money to British Airways (on top of the extra money I paid Expedia) in order to choose my seats ahead of time. To add insult to injury, the itinerary sent by Expedia immediately after my purchase indicated that my one checked bag was, in fact, not included. Huh? Obviously, their website is misleading. Next time I'll know better than to pay extra fees to Expedia for services they are not able to deliver."
"I have booked with them a few times when I could get the flights I needed on their site, but not on the individual airline's site (partner relationships available and easy to book on Expedia that the individual airline site didn't show). I had good a good experience of these several occasions (no hiccups for issues). Usually I just use Expedia to do general searches to get ideas and book from the individual airline site if I can get the same flights from either place."

"Kris,1. This is nor Expedia2. Use paragraphs and cut out all the hyperbole if you want a tone tobread your complaint. (I gave up half waybthorough)"
"Well done AmoMondo, I couldn’t even get that far...."
"Good grief! I couldn't get past the first quarter of this post, especially do to the lack of paragraphs. Apparently Kris has no clue that TA is not Customer Service for any travel-related company, including Expedia. She joined TA just to make this post, which will go nowhere? Just what does she think anyone here is going to do for her? Hopefully she at least checks back to see that she needs to work with Expedia and her bank to get the issue resolved, not a bunch of strangers. Maybe she has learned that there is far less protection using a debit card than a credit card when doing on-line transactions and that the money will go out of your account much faster than it will be returned if an issue arrives. ."
"This is textbook definition of TL; DR. As noted, never use a debit card- always use a credit card. Your cc could have had that second charge reversed a lot faster than 10 business days."
"It’s awful experience, I booked car rental through expedia, I prepaid When I arrived they said there is no car available with this price range Car rental. Company offer me same car with double of price and expedia did not help me"
Don’t use it
Special thank to Rahul from Expedia who is so kind and helpful on our booking. Much appreciated and many thanks to him!
"Never use Expedia.com. Zero refund on my Hong Kong trip from Bangkok despite turmoil over there. American corporate greed at its worst. 3 days before my flight the airports were completely shut down in Hong Kong, and all flights grounded. I called the day before my flight and told them I did not want to travel there because of the instability of the airport. I feared for my safety. They now claim that I did not specifically mention the word “cancel”. Semantics. This company is dishonest and takes advantage of its customers. I spent over 5 hours on the phone with various people to no gain. I am out over $1000.00. Be advised."
"Io sono MOLTO soddisfatto del servizio Expedia, soprattutto dopo l'esperienza che ho avuto quest'estate Ho già acquistato decine di voli e alberghi attraverso Expedia, e anche quest'estate ho acquistato un volo Aegean verso Creta.Non era ben chiaro fosse il bagaglio compreso o no; a seguito verifiche sembrava di si ma, arrivati al check in, abbiamo dovuto pagare 40€ a bagaglio per il volo di andata e 60€ per quello di ritorno (in quanto acquistato On Line), per un totale di 140€. Piuttosto contrariati, al ritorno abbiamo sporto reclamo attraverso l'apposita pagina Expedia e...SORPRESA! Ci hanno risposto subito e pochi giorni dopo ci hanno restituito L'INTERA CIFRA accreditandola sulla mia carta di credito. Molto oltre le mie aspettative.Per me, Expedia per tutta la vita.Edited: 1:56 pm, September 15, 2019 "
"DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY - I BOOKED WITH THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND RECEIVED NOTHING BUT COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT.  They have very poor customer service and only cares about money.I booked everything with them flights and hotel. Flight was delayed which made me miss my hotel and they refused to give me credit, I had to fight for two weeks and finally got to corporate and they finally issued the credit an d made me think they were doing me a favor. then now, they refuse to give me points for the two weeks I booked because I apparently joined the loyalty program after. I have no idea how I joined after but you'd think after all the mess that happened, not to mention my confusion since I booked it using the app with my email signed in, I'd automatically get points? Anyways, Expedia has been completely disappointing and stressful. Save yourself the troubles and find another travel agency who values customer service and loyally."
"ExpediaDuring a fire storm Expedia wanted us to refund $16.00AUD to a guest against our cancellation policy. When advised we were in a fire zone they want to know if we would refund still !!!!. We told them have no medical/food/gas and the fires are surrounding our town all villages have been burnt. and we may have to evacuate...Expedia you need to have some compassion and understanding what is happening out side your office....Edited: 1:27 am, January 03, 2020 "
I recommend to stay away from expedia when booking flights..once you book via Expedia many airlines will not help you make anybcunages and expedia will send you to the airline....you will be like a ball in a ping pong game between expedia and the airline
"I am truly upset. Long rant incoming.I spoke to Expedia's CR officer, let's call him R, earlier on the phone and to resolve the situation of my return flight booking being booked only halfway, i.e. my departure flight was done, return flight not. And this was after 2 nights of constant ""errors of processing my booking and to try again later"" on their website and increasing prices during this entire ""erroneous"" period. On the phone, what was promised was for me to complete the booking of my return flight from Melbourne to Singapore on Expedia, and the balance would be refunded to me (since the fares have increased, yet again) and the failure to complete the booking was on Expedia's end-- not mine.This was the only bit of good news I heard since Tuesday when I was trying to get the tickets (only to keep getting the error message ""your order couldn't be processed at this time, please try again later"" -- only to have the fares constantly increase each time. This happened on Tuesday night, and last night when I finally got through, only HALF my booking was completed??? I checked on Expedia again for a one-way trip from Melbourne back to Singapore via Scoot -- only to find that there wasn't even such a flight anymore. I called in and spoke to R, who made the promise that the balance would be refunded if I were to complete the booking via Expedia once more, but unfortunately I couldn't spot any Scoot flight back to Singapore, only Qantas-- which was a $500+ fare per person. R insisted there was a Scoot flight on his screen, but suggested I refresh my cache and try again. I did -- still no Scoot flight. I said I'll try again later, but do I get his reassurance that even if I were to call back later, this ""promise"" would be fulfilled and he said, yes. While on the phone, he was even checking (presumably with his management) whether I could go ahead to book the Qantas return flight and have the balance returned to me... it was to that extent that I am 100% certain I did not mishear / misunderstand him and his promise that any excess I had to fork out (after my failed $375 return flight booking via Expedia) would be refunded to me, if I were to go ahead and book my return flight with Expedia once more. With that, I asked for his name, hung up, and tried again later.Lo and behold, I finally saw the aforementioned Scoot flight on Expedia! Thank GOD I didn't buy the tickets though, because when I called in again and spoke to another guy from Expedia, he rejected my entire claim and 30 minutes' conversation, refusing to fulfil the ""promise"" on the premise that there was no documentation of my entire conversation with R, nor could he trace who this R was............Honestly? This is my worst experience ever. By far, the WORST. And it's not even over yet."
"kaexanne... sorry to hear of your difficulties with Expedia and hope your situation resolves. As you probably realise now, you could have booked all your flights directly with the airlines concerned. Expedia, or any other search engine, is good for giving you ideas re schedules but then you just revert to the airline's website to secure everything. If the price is significantly different on the airline's website. that might be because the agent's fare is not live, not accurate and not available."
"#191We already know all the dangers of using an OTA...sadly you found us after,not before.Expedia is one of the better online agents,you were lucky...and as Mr Bean pointed out above...book direct in future.Good luck."
For sure. Lesson well learnt. Still not a pleasant experience because.. what do ticketing sites exist for then? I.e. if they provide such a service (and not just as reference like Skyscanner or Momondo)... then well I guess that should be working most (if not all) of the time. Thanks though!! Lesson well learnt indeed.

Ticketing sites exist to make money.
Expedia works well. Recently booked tickets from USA to Europe for travel in May and cancelled within 24 hrs. The amount was credited back to my credit card within 2 days.
"Absolute thieves! In light of Covid-19, I went on the site looking to get information from an agent about 2 flights we had scheduled for April 2. I scrolled over talk to an agent but because the system is so backlogged, I had to repeat about a dozen times and I still couldn’t reach an agent. About 2 mins after closing the site, I received an email stating my flights were cancelled and there was no refund. I immediately tried to call and it won’t even let me cue. I dialed over and over about 2dozen times. I then went back online trying to contact to online support. After trying about 20 times, I was placed in a queue that said the wait will be approximately 45mins. I waited. Finally an agent came on and after an hour going back and forth via email, I was informed that they are following their policy and the flights were cancelled by the flyer. I’m flabbergasted that they would just take my money and run!!They must be trying to capitalize on the backs of everyone, so beware."
"were the tickets refundable or were the airline(s) offering refunds? (if the flights were still operating then many airlines are allowing rebooking changes but not refunds.)third parties can only pass on whatever refunds the airline issues.Have you checked if your travel insurance covers the reason for cancellation?Edited: 12:44 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Although you booked through Expedia, you were charged and had a contract of carriage with the Airline. You can call them.Your flight was cancelled by the airline. You will get a credit. Not an Expedia issue."
"THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!I was in the same situation as many of you - booked flights and hotel with Expedia for TD for March break but had to cancel due to COVID-19. Even though I called many times a day, I was not able to contact an Expedia agent to cancel because the line disconnects after being on hold for 1 hour. I finally spoke to an agent on March 21 (after 2.5 hr hold) and she was very helpful and I will be getting a full refund for the hotel and credits for my flights, which I can use to purchase future flights within next 12 months.I like to give everyone some suggestions which may be helpful. 1. Call them on a phone which has a record of all the calls you made to Expedia, especially important if you are claiming Trip Cancellation Insurance2. If your line keeps getting disconnected after being on hold (like my home phone), then try using another phone like your cellphone3. I called them first thing in the morning and while I was on hold, I kept the phone close by me on speaker mode while I did my chores around the house4. Once you reach an agent, make sure you tell them right away what number to call you back if your call gets disconnected, because this did happen to me5. Not all agents are equal, some are not helpful at all, but today I was lucky and I got a really kind agent named Sarah and she helped me process all my refunds and credits6. BE KIND to the agents because it is not their fault you had to wait so long. If you get angry and rude with them, they may not go out of their way to help resolve your problem7. Expedia for TD has a separate line for French and you can definitely reach an agent faster if you use that line but you must be able to speak French"
"HelloI have been trying call Expedia.com for 2 weeks and as others have already stated, I keep getting disconnected after one hour or longer. When I check my itinerary number, it claims I have no refunds recorded. I can appreciate how busy they are but anxiety is high and I don’t want to lose my money as well as my vacation."
https://www.expedia.com/lp/coronavirus-travel
"I understand Expedia has a huge volume of trip changes and cancellations, however, their communication has been awful! We cancelled our trip on line in March due to the Covid-19. I cancelled online. I also have tried to call numerous times and the message says I cannot talk to an agent because my trip is not within the next ten days. If I go to their website, they say there is an option to email them, but only gives me the phone number to call. I feel like I am on a merry go round!! I will never book with Expedia again. I have had to cancel two other trips, which I made reservations directly with the airlines, and had no problem getting a credit for future travel. I consider myself a patient person, but no longer with this situation. Good bye Expedia ...never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Just remember that should you miss your flight and have ANY concerns you will NOT be able to contact them in any way! Have been there so just make sure you are taking that chance!!!!! Insurance does not always cover various circumstances as delayed flights (been there also). So think twice!
"<< I cannot talk to an agent because my trip is not within the next ten days. >>Many OTAs are trying to handle their overwhelming number of cancellations and refunds in an organised way. Taking calls from customers in a 10 day period before departure day makes sense. When your trip is within 10 days of departure, call them as they have asked."
"#206 if most people would follow the ""please don't call unless your flight is in the next 3 days"" like almost all alirnes and otas are asking now, there would not be all day holds. I bet half the people clogging the system don't have valid refund cases and are all demanding to talk to a supervisor, which you should never make a call center person do"
"Disgraceful.Booked flights through Expedia.The flights were cancelled by the airline due to Covid 19 but Expedia refused to refund me stating my tickets were Economy and non refundable.I tried to deal directly with the airline (Aegean Airways) but they say they will only deal with Expedia who are their customer, not me. Expedia have given me no help or protections and I am out of pocket despite it being the law that refunds must be made in this case..I will never use Expedia or their many sister companies again."
"“ but Expedia refused to refund me stating my tickets were Economy and non refundable.”—-I’d be surprised if that’s what Expedia are telling customers, possibly a misunderstanding? However, your next course of action would be to contact your credit card provider for advice."
"Agreed, did you cancel your tickets before the airline canceled the flight? Did you read the TOS before you purchased from Expedia? There are a lot of reasons your flight might not be refundable. I don't care if you buy from the airline, from a brick and mortar travel agent, or from a online travel agency...always read the TOS, be fully aware of what your buying and what the requirements are for refunds etc. One reason i do like expedia is you can do all this online yourself just log in and manage your trip, if there is no option to rebook or refund, re read exactly what you bought then call them again"
"No I did not cancel, the airline cancelled. As the law stands, if the airline cancels (no matter what type of ticket you have) then the airline must give a refund. That is my whole frustration. The law protects me but Expedia and Aegean are flouting this law (as are other airlines.)"
"I also received an email from Expedia yesterday....""I understand that you want to cancel your reservation. Please note that cancellation can only be made in adherence to the supplier's policy. In this case your booking is non-refundable""My flight was cancelled by Emirates, I did not cancel it so this is incorrect. It appears there are a few misinformed agents there giving out the wrong advice!"
"@Amanda: Yes, you are right, airlines are flouting that law. They claim that they are in a struggle to survive and don't have the money.It is VERY frustrating for their customers. But right now, short of making the claims, or issuing chargebacks through credit cards, there is very little that can be done."
"COVID-19 truly exposed the dishonesty of Expedia. We booked travel to Europe in January 2020 but had to cancel due to COVID-19 and our associated immunity compromisation. We get a medical letter. The airline (SAS) says go throug Expeida for a refund. After a while (2 months) Expedia says we will refund you in 8 weeks. SAS says if we do not get the money in 8 weeks they would process the refund.Well, it has been 8 week and no Expedia refund. AND now SAS says they can't refund us. You cannot get through to Expedia. If you are lucky to get someone on the phone they will hang up.I have seen many dishonest companies, but Expedia beats all. I recommend strongly NOT to use them ever."
"""We booked travel to Europe in January 2020 but had to cancel due to COVID-19 and our associated immunity compromisation."" - If you cancelled before the airline cancelled the flight then you are not due a refund unless you bought expensive refundable tickets (unlikely)In your situation this would be a claim against your travel insurance subject to policy terms ""I have seen many dishonest companies, but Expedia beats all."" - Based on what you have posted I do not see anything dishonest"
"#214 - your situation is being shared by tens of thousands of others who booked thru OTA's like Expedia, eDreams, Travelgenio, Ovago, etc. When you book with a 3rd-party like Expedia, the OTA becomes the customer of the airlines, not you. Therefore anything related to your booking needs to go thru Expedia. As a result, I'm surprised that SAS ever told you they would process your refund as you are not their customer. If and when SAS passes a refund to Expedia, they will have to pass it to you. Right now 60-90 days is not unheard of for refunds from many travel-related companies. For a cancelled April trip I was told upfront it would take 60-90 days to get a refund if that is what I wanted. From Expedia's website:""For flights, most refunds are issued within 8 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.You say you booked in January but was that when you were actually supposed to travel or just when you made your booking? That certainly can have an affect on where you stand in the queue for getting a refund. Expedia is likely working on refunds in the order flights were cancelled, not necessarily when travel was booked.This is unprecedented times and Expedia, like so many other companies, are dealing with an overwhelming amount of refund requests and may very well be trying to handle them with fewer employees. IMO, your current situation doesn't make Expedia dishonest just because refunds are not being processed in the time-frames people want. Expedia is actually one of the better 3rd-party OTA's. Hopefully this will be a lesson learned to book directly with the airlines in the future, as people who did are having an easier time of getting their situations sorted out, although many are complaining about only receiving vouchers. If you want a refund, you have to be persistent, even when booking direct."
"I booked a ticket for Emirates to Delhi from Newcastle return ,January/ March.Return flight was cancelled by Emirates.Expedia was unavailable,and did not respond at all until I approached them through Resolver.They are still evading,excusing,and delaying.Just dont use them."
"We booked with Expedia for Italy last Sept. @ couples well aware that we were booking non refundable tickets. Expedia sent both couples an email with in an hour of each other telling us that our trip was cancelled either by the airline. (air canada) or the fact that we did not take our trip due to Covid issues. Our trip wasn't scheduled to leave until June 22nd. We were waiting to see if things were going to settle before then, so that we might still be able take the trip. Air Canada no longer is offering the flights originally scheduled on our itinerary. And trying to get any info from Expedia is like trying to get blood from a stone. We were told that we were being given credit vouchers for our flights on air canada, but as yet have not received anything in Email. It has been since April 16th. AC just turns a blind eye, and Expedia isn't interested in making anything right."
"Dreadful - they do not answer letters to London Head Office, there is a 3 hour queue on the telephone helpline. Emails are answered with a ""no-reply"" auto-response. Chatline doesn't work. Took me since early April to get a refund from them, - they keep fobbing me off with vouchers which expire at the year end. Dreadful company - I would not book a two penny bus ticket with them ever again."
"You just have to keep at Expedia - I emailed five times a week, registered a chargeback complaint with MasterCard, made a real nuisance of myself. I got paid last week for a flight booked in February.I will NEVER book so much as a local bus ticket with Expedia again"
"My experience was horrible. Booked a flight in March 2020 with flight protection. Cancelled in June due to COVID & not feeling safe to fly. They issued me a credit instead of a full refund. And I just spoke with them, and they will not give refunds because of this pandemic. LAST time I ever use them for a flight. I have never cancelled a flight until now, and after seeing how they handled during a pandemic, shows you how little they feel for the customers."
"What were the terms and conditions of the booking, Sue? Did they call for a refund based on what you bought? Or are you hoping they will give a cash refund for some other reason?"
""" Cancelled in June due to COVID & not feeling safe to fly. ""Did you cancel your reservation or did the airline cancel the flight prior to you contacting the airline? The answer to that makes a big difference in whether or not you are entitled to a full refund. Unless you bought a very expensive, fully-refundable ticket instead of the nonrefundable tickets most people buy, you won't be getting a refund if you initiated the cancellation prior to the flight being cancelled (if it was even cancelled). If you cancel because of your disinclination to travel, then the most the airlines are willing to provide is a voucher for future travel, many of which are good till sometime in 2022. If the airline you were set to fly with won't refund Expedia because of this policy, why would you expect Expedia to refund you? When you book thru a third-party like Expedia, Expedia becomes the airline's customer, not you. You are Expedia's customer and any refund/voucher will have to come thru Expedia.If you have ""flight protection"" (travel insurance), have you contacted the insurer to see if you are covered to make a claim thru them?"
"SueI don’t think Expedia is your problem. Your problem is unrealistic expectations. Sounds like you canceled the flight and now you want a refund, that’s not the way it worked. If the airline cancels you’re entitled to a refund if you just decide “I’m too scared to fly” you get a credit. And they don’t really even have to give you that. the truth is the airlines are being niceI have had both happened, I had to cancel the flight because my employer decided we were not flying anymore And I have a credit which has to be used at some point. And then Delta canceled another flight and I got My money back. Two totally different circumstances totally different outcomes."
"It reads to me as though you cancelled the flight tickets, Sue. If that is correct then I think you are fortunate to get a credit from them. The decision on offering a gesture of goodwill is that of the airline, not Expedia. So the airline should be applauded and Expedia deserves no criticism.You'd probably be in the same position if you;d booked direct, and a worse one if you;d used one of the useless agents such as Travelgenio or Edreams/Opodo."
"I would not recommend booking a flight through Expedia. I have had now two bad experiences with flights booked through Expedia, which got cancelled by the airline. In such cases, Expedia does not take any responsibility and you cannot get a refund. On the other hand, the airline does not take any responsibility because the booking was made through Expedia and they would not issue a refund either. My advice: use Expedia only to check how you can get to your destination. After that book directly with the respective airline(s)."

"""book directly with the respective airline(s).""Wish I had just a dollar for every time that statement has appeared here on TA, but yet thousands still don't get it and end up on here complaining about the 3rd-party OTA they booked with. What's that saying about you can't fix stupid?"
