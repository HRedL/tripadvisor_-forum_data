Any news about coronavirus in Aruba? About in 2 weeks we have flight for Aruba but we are so worried
"You might check any one of the eleventy or so existing threads on the topic.Really no reason to start a new one... just to ask the question.Edited: 11:29 pm, March 11, 2020 "
We are going in two weeks to with a stopover in Newark....I went on Aruba's government website. There are no restrictions there. I just worry about our airlines and our flights
"Hi , tnx for your comment! The same thing we r worried about! We will be traveling from Buenos Aires to Panamacity then to Aruba! Be safe and good luck"
"We are schedule to leave 3/31 to head to Aruba....at this point we still plan on going, but with everything happening and growing so quickly I'm getting more concerned that the trip may get postponed."
"We were supposed to go on 4/1 from massachusetts, but made the decision to cancel and go later. It's just not worth it right now. Estimates are that around 25% of americans are going to contract the virus before all is said and done, and the only way to ""flatten the curve"" is to distance yourself. Flying right now is just not a good idea, nevermind sharing a resort/taxi/restaurant/public spaces with other travelers from who knows where. I don't consider myself an alarmist, but what happened to Italy is shocking, and the only way to prevent it from spreading worldwide is to be smart about it. We'll go another time, as disappointing as it may be."
"Yes, you should be worried, Aruba is not prepared and the medical help is really bad!"
R u from Aruba? So weird you dont have any post just opened a account to write this?
Here's a statement from visit Aruba via minister of health. https:/…
"Yes I am, and scared as hell here awaiting the arrival of the virus, we are very small Island, it would not hold the shock. The Netherlands has 50% of the total patients that the USA has, and yet the USA is way more bigger that the Netherlands. And still 2 airplanes arrives daily from the Netherlands to Aruba, we are just waiting here, it is creepy. We must protect our community, stop coming to Aruba for now, wait till this epidemic vanish."
"Yes i got you! Im from Argentina and the same thing is happening here! Today finally the government canceled all flights coming from china, europ and USA , let see what will happen good luck"
"Alice M.I so agree with you.We have just cancelled our April trip.I think, in this state of affairs, it is socially irresponsible for us to travel to AUA. Our friends who live on the island, {unlike you} said as of today...come on down...planes are coming in every day.We have friends to stay with if we are ""stuck"" on the island and we have all the time in the world because we are retired.But I think Aruba should close it's Port and airport and protect the citizens of the island.To my knowledge, there is one hospital, and one urgent care. With, at least, between flights and ships,...... over 2,000 visitors arriving daily. In fact, I am so adamant about this I might start a new thread."
We cancelled our trip that was scheduled the end of next week. It’s the smart and responsible thing to do.
"FYI the only reason the Netherlands has more cases, even relative to the population, is because in the Netherlands, but also in the rest of Europe, testing is actually being done. There is STILL no testing going on in the states unless you are rich and have them done through private labs. The US is completely blind and has totally botched the initial response. There is no way of knowing how far the virus has spread already in the communities in the US. Especially the NE of the US where Aruba gets most of its tourists from. The Netherlands is the least of our worries. 2 planes versus almost all the rest."
"Thank you all for understanding, I am in panic because I have lived here all mine life and I know that Aruba has a mayor medical neglect here, many people has die unnecessary and with this corona virus spreading so fast as mention we only have 1 hospital and 1 urgent care and they are both small and not enough for the speed that the virus is spreading. I am following the spread, especially the one in the Netherlands and they are not taking this serious at all, that is why its spreading so fast, and not because USA is not testing that the amount between them is so big, the Netherlands is also not testing everyone, they are being very stubborn with the test, they are not holding back to keep the economie rolling. And still Aruba is accepting flights from EU and USA. As all Governments they are eager for the money and making sure they survive when the virus is here and may the strongest survive. In the way the Government has announced it, they will let the cow drown first and will take action after the 2nd cow has drown. I do not trust the Government and the Doctors here, as many of the locals do, as you may know, almost everybody goes to Colombia because the Doctors here are not clever enough to save lives."
unfortunately he was from NJ like me sometimes we can be abrupt lol
"I'm here in Aruba through tomorrow (March 14th). Everything seems to be normal though there is a lot of talk of the virus among visitors from the US. While there are no cases in Aruba, there is some risk at airports and on airplanes. We strongly considered postponing or cancelling our trip but are so glad we came. We did see several cruise ships turned away this week. A couple we met here told us the hotel staff said it was because the ship has ill passengers on board. Again, we heard visitors say this, not verified by any authority or informed source. My employer has asked that I work remotely for the 14 days following my return home to Maine. I'm fortunate to have that option and would suggest considering what implications travel may have when you return to the states. If I can remember, I'll reply again tomorrow to let you know about screening or other return processes from Aruba to the states."
"It’s already confirm in Curaçao, very likely it will be soon in Aruba too, the Minister of Health is busy here attracting the virus with measurements that are clearly not enough. All flights should be canceled for tourist attraction for a while. It is a time where the panic is world wide to be notice. Let us all be safe and make our effort to make the spreading stop. Stay home and be a minimalist for a while, prevention is better than cure."
"Alice im waiting for my flight company to confirm if they cancel it! Please keep updating me ! Argentina is doing everything to prevent, im scared of the airport in Panamacity! Anyways please keep inform"
This is probably your best resource: https:/…
A friend from the island just sent me a message saying they now have two cases and they're at the hospital currently.
Its awful news for them and all of my good friends in Aruba.
Friend lives there. Just got first case American brought it. Hopefully won’t spread there
"It was tough to do but we just cancelled our trip. First time in 15 years we won't be visiting Aruba, UGH."
Latest update - https:/…
We are scheduled to fly from Philly to Aruba in early April and really considering pushing the dates out to a later time. Our flight American Airlines is offering a 1 time free change to push out the dates and our resort is offering a rebate to rebook. It’s just not worth it imo if you can push out ur dates to a later time.
Your resort isn’t doing the right this. I wish the resort we booked at was doing the same. Marriott is not offering owners a break.
"Today the government announced a case of Coronavirus from a passenger that came from new york . Trust me im local , and this virus will spread faster than other nation , because the island is very small and pressurized"
"Sorry for the mis information . The government annouced two cases , not one."
"I read as of today there are 2 cases in Aruba. Both travelers. I am scheduled 4/2 to fly to Aruba from Massachusetts with 6 others. MA cases are increasing quickly, so I am expecting more travel restrictions.I was suppose to leave today for Disney for a week with family, but that got cancelled with parks closing.Disappointing, but realistic. Will make decision in the next week with travel friends"
"Kenny if I were you and they are offering that, I would take it. When you go on vacation, you want it to be relaxed not talk of corona virus and things can still escalate even more than what they already have. I am booked in mid May and have decided that if my flight makes that offer then, I will take it and rebook. My hotel offers 24hr cancellation for a full refund."
I meant your resort IS doing the right thing. Marriott is not allowing owners to cancel.
"Monica, you may want to double check with the Marriott as policies keep changing. We’re booked at the Renaissance for May and there is a notice on their site that Marriott is allowing cancellation without penalty up to 24 hours prior."
"2 cases confirmed today in Aruba and widespread travel bans for EU travelers, possible US- unclear."
"Annie, te comento que estaremos viajando el día 23/3 desde Argentina.Estoy desconcertado y sin saber qué decisión es más razonable en este momento en relación al viaje."
"A lot of misinformation in this thread and I can't for the life of me understand how tripadvisor allows this forum to be un-moderated like this. You guys will get much better info from the actual Aruba forum at aruba.com/forum or on reddit at /r/Aruba.On topic:There are two people infected. One US citizen who was performing consultancy work for WEB(water & electricity plant). He came from NYCOne local resident who recently came back from NYC. As we can see both originated in the US. WHO named Europe the new epicenter, but in reality we have no clue on the extent of the spread in the US itself as testing has simply not been done. The slow response in the US has amazed me. Travel ban in effect for Europe and other risk countries, NOT yet for USA, but this can change daily."
2 confirmed cases in Aruba.
"Yes, hotels are doing the right thing. Time shares are being much more restrictive. Even air BnB is allowing cancellations. Marriott Vacation Club is not."
A mi me encantaria cancelar pero aun aerolínea de copa no esta cancelando! Yo lo cambiaría por mas adelante estoy con dos bebes y re preocupados
Thanks for the info
"Abel porfavor informame si viajan, como es todo! Suerte"
Friday the 13th we got our first two confirmed cases
Veremos qué hacer en esta semana y cómo se desarrollará todo. Saludos
"Unfortunately as of today 3/14/20, there are two confirmed cases is Aruba. We are scheduled to go there the last week of April but probably will be cancelling."
2 cases of Coronavirus as of yesterday March 13th.
Trump Derangement Syndrome???
"I was also planning on going but as of yesterday, there are two cases there. Their schools have been closed. I’m afraid of going and dealing with shops and restaurants closed as well."
I’m supposed to go next week. We’re you able to get money back or at least get credit for a later time?
"Everyone that cancelled, were you refunded? Credited for a later date?"
American Airlines is offering a 1 time free change to push dates out. We are supposed to travel early April. Resorts will vary but mine is offering a rebate to book later dates.
2 Cases in Aruba test positive for Coronavirus in Aruba 3/13/20
"My spouse and I are scheduled to fly from Charlotte, NC to Aruba on Saturday March 21st (one week away). Naturally we are very worried, but have been told so far all is well!! I spoke with a woman at the resort that let me know that as of today, they are 100% operational... I will certainly take all precautions and continue to watch the government website closely, but as of not, we are still going!"
I just got back yesterday. It's incredible how things have progressed with this virus while we were away. I have to stay home for 14 days now. You may be ok while you are there but what if your country implements restrictions when you get back. Make sure you can afford to stay longer or be home for 14 days when you get back. We had an amazing time. Hard to get back to this reality.
There are 2 cases
There are 2 cases. One Aruban citizen and one American
The first cases reported Friday. Aruba has banned non-nationals arriving from Europe starting Sunday. Aruba schools canceled starting Monday.
I have a trip planned to Aruba on March 31. Hoping we are still able to make it. What do you guys think? Should we be canceling?
How about US citizens? Here in Argentina they are banned for a month
"I was refunded by Marriott and all excursions except for $160 from seabob aruba. United airlines gave us credits to use later equal to what we paid in airfare.Edited: 1:42 pm, March 14, 2020 "
We are scheduled to leave Mar 31 as well and will most likely cancel and reschedule.
Where did you stay? Are there people still out and about ? Are beaches open ? We’re not expected to leave until March 31
We’re scheduled to leave march 31 as well we don’t know what to do...
is anybody aware or know where to find what flight(s) the sick passengers were on?
"2 cases as of yesterday (:arch 13, 2020) and all flights from Europe to Aruba have been restricted until March 31 at this point"
"2 cases as of yesterday M :arch 13, 2020) and all flights from Europe to Aruba have been restricted until March 31 at this point"
Hi I'm supposed to be traveling to Aruba on Thursday so I've been monitoring the situation closely. They just confirmed 2 cases of covid 19 today. One was a Aruban coming back from New York and the other a US citizen. They have banned all travellers from Europe to enter Aruba.
They just announced their first 2 cases. It was on CNN news. Both cases originated from US.
Everyone who has planned a trip to Aruba needs to weigh this decision on his/her own. We flew here last week and some guests arrived today. If you are under 50 the risks are very low. Some people are comfortable with taking a small risk and others aren't.
Is it business as usually? Places open? I no it’s a day to day.
Covid-19 is apolitical. Your comment is irresponsible.
"Sorry, this should have been directed to Doug j."
"I'm feel so close to aruba's people, close, close,close the airport!"
3 new cases found
"""Presently there are ships in the Bridgetown Port terminating their voyages mid-itinerary, which now have to be berthed and their passengers need to get home safely via scheduled flights and a significant number of chartered flights,” the release said.“This is happening in Ports all across the globe at this moment. During this suspension period, Barbadians can expect to see some of our home porting ships berthed in the Port as well as offshore for an extended period of time. No passengers will be on board.”""Has Aruba essentially closed its port?"
they have 2 confirmed cases...…Both cases originated from NY.Really only 2cases????? How many are being tested? This is a country that economy is based on tourism.
Have you decided if you are going? I have trip in 2 weeks
We leave tomorrow morning......
"We are supposed to be flying out of Charlotte, NC next Saturday, March 21st and staying until the 28th.. So far my resort is saying that they are 100% operational, so I am still going as of now..."
"https:/…Originally, I thought this was ONLY related to guests coming from Italy/China etc, but this press release says ""ALL incoming flights"" Double check with your airline, of course, and check back every few days- Clearly this is fast moving situation. Good luck.Edited: 8:56 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Thank you for your information. We are supposed to leave Boston on April 8th for Aruba and we can't decide what to do.
This sucks I can’t believe our trip is ruined! We were supposed to be leaving March 31st!
"<< ""e are supposed to leave Boston on April 8th for Aruba and we can't decide what to do."" >>Aruba decided for you... all inbound flights banned.https:/…"

I can't believe how selfish some people are. Stay home people and not risk spreading this this. You can rebook your trip.
Im here in Aruba flying home tomorrow...staying at the Hilton. The mgmt put a letter under our door telling us all inbound travel of non residents is cancelled as of midnight Monday. The feeling of locals was covad19 would never be a problem here due to high temps....after news broke late Sat about two cases we have seen many workers wearing gloves.
<< “ feeling of locals was covad19 would never be a problem here due to high temps” >>Shame that so many people around the world are willing to believe such nonsensical “magical thinking” in this day and age.
"Annie, finalmente se cerraron las fronteras en Aruba.creeria que se puede reprogramar considerándose un caso de fuerza mayor. Considero lo mejor para poder disfrutar del viaje en otra oportunidad. Saludos."
"Igual nosotros Abel, suerte!"

"I am scheduled to go to Aruba on March 21, Saturday. Will I be allowed in? What is Aruba doing at its airports for visitors arriving from New York?"
Today is the 15th of March I am scheduled to arrive in Aruba on 21st of March. What can I expect at the airport when I arrive. Will I be allowed in or or not?
All flights canceled till 31 im sorry
I was told by someone in Aruba the that travel ban into Aruba will most likely be extended into April for another 2 weeks.
The good news is that visitors on the island will be assured that they will be able to take their return flight home. Posted on Visit Aruba News 3/15/2020
Thank you for your valuable evaluaton.So surprised the Island didn;t shut down as St Martin did. People's lives are more valuable than the business interests in Aruba and everywhere .I am cancelling my trip to Aruba .
American Airlines has suspended all service to Aruba till May 6 from my airport Philadelphia and several others. Check with your airline for updates.
"Yes , you should be concerned as this a GLOBAL OUTBREAK and as it has been advised ALL non essential travel need to be canceled. You do g want to spread the outbreak but also not get infected also . There’s also a travel advisory on Aruba website https:/…And someone was also air lifted to their back home from Aruba cause of COVID-19 So yes it is Concerning .."
"I had to cancel because my flight with Southwest was cancelled. I also have Marriott and because it is within 60 days, I have to have my points put in a hold and must be used by the end of the year. The only thing they changed was that my window for rebooking is 120 days versus 60 days. So wrong."
"Kia, did you see where Aruba has banned all international flights into Aruba until Mar. 31st?"
Arubas airport is closed they announced it las Saturday or friday
Keep yourself updated on Vista Aruba. We are basically in lockdown until the end of April.
really your trip is ruined? That is a little self centered dont you think whe thousands are dying in the US?
"Everybody should be concerned. This is a GLOBAL Pandemic. I am proud of my friends in Aruba; they closed the Airport arrivals and the Cruise terminal quickly. I looked up the number of cases today and it was only 100 cases with 2 unfortunate deaths.If every country put lives before economy, I would be able to visit my favorite place this year, but we may need to wait until 2021 for our next Happy Island Visit. Bon-Bini!"
No need for negative. Chill out dude
""" but we may need to wait until 2021 for our next Happy Island Visit. Bon-Bini!""The will be bankrupt by then"
