"We will be flying into Denver airport in July to treat my high school graduate to a few days of adventure. His top things to do are white water rafting, atv mountain tour, ziplining, horseback riding. What resort area do you recommend for us that's 1-2 hour drive from Denver. Thank you!"
"The Buena Vista/Salida/Chaffee County area has everything you want assuming all those activities have reopened from coronavirus by the time of your visit. Breckenridge and Summit County have most of what you want. You would commute to Buena Vista for whitewater rafting. You can stay in Breckenridge or stay in the Buena Vista/Salida area.https://www.colorfulcolorado.com/https://gobreck.com/Because of the 9,600 ft. altitude of Breckenridge, spending your first overnight in Colorado there may not be the best option due to the potential effects of altitude illness.DIA is out on the plains. Your driving time to get to the activities you want will in some cases be more than 2 hours. Buena Vista is 2.5 to 3 hours. Breckenridge is about 2 hours.Edited: 2:56 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Michelle, the Denver airport is out on the plains east of the City of Denver. It could take you an hour just to drive across town to get to the foothills west of Denver. fv1989 has given you the best advice; I recommend staying in the Buena Vista/Salida area. Lots to do there."
