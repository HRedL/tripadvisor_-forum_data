My fiancee and I are thinking about going to St. Barths for our Honeymoon! Apparently I am a mosquito magnet and am a little concerned about traveling to the area due to the Chikungunya outbreaks - can anyone offer any update or insights to the current conditions there - we would be arriving in August Many Thanks!!
"I can't offer any official information but if you look around you will find info (e.g. PAHO website) but we recently returned and have been home long enough to be out of the window for symptoms to appear. We had 7 people traveling in our group and some were bitten a lot and others (including me) not at all. Nobody has had any symptoms of Chikungunya. I suggest you wear repellant and have a good time.I was also in St. Martin in March and same thing...some bites, no Chikungunya. Enjoy your honeymoon!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Like the weather and beaches, conditions are always changing and dependent on many things (including the weather...) so it's hard to predict. However, being a small and mostly affluent island dependent on tourism, the govt does everything it can to minimize exposure. They frequently spray the island and have eliminated or cleaned up spawning areas.As a visitor, you can take steps to protect yourself. This includes using a strong DEET based repellent (many types are available on the island), wearing long pants and sleeves, especially in the evening (don't worry, many locals and European visitors do the same) and avoiding standing water. If renting a villa, ask the agency to spray thoroughly before you arrive, and if necessary, during your visit. Hotels will likely do the same. There are these awesome skeeter rackets you can buy at the grocery store, as well coils and sprays for inside and out. Of course you realize, none of this is a guarantee against bites or the virus, which is a problem throughout the Caribbean."
"They are constantly spraying the island because this is a concern. When the statistics were presented in the NY Times last year, they extrapolated a number that had no basis in reality. My doctor, who is on the island annually in February was shocked I was still going because he ""heard at a dinner party"" 10,000 people had the disease on the island.When I reminded him there are only 5,000 residents on the island he was a little abashed to be repeating such stuff. I know residents who got the disease but don't know any short term visitors who have. I was pretty good about spraying before I went out at night but didnt spray all day."
"A number of people have contracted this virus in Florida. I don't think there is too much concern over visiting Florida, and by the same token, this should not be a reason to stop visiting St Barths.As others have mentioned, just be aware of the possible risk and take the appropriate precautions. Be sensible !"
"11 locally transmitted cases, none this year, in Florida - population about 20 million.1600 cases, 300 this year, in St Barts - population about 10 thousand."
"Scorpio, so what's your point?Tthat Chikingunya has been more established in SBH and that it has only recently arrived in the US so more people on SBH have it or are just trying to scare people? Since its only recently been seen in the US, it's very likely that it follows the path of other mosquito borne illnesses like west nile and the incidence in the US goes up. You going to warn people off Texas then?"
"Numbers should not scare people but may help make informed decisions. - different people have different thresholds for accepting risks. I am not warning people off any location. The reasons are many but Chik-V has not led to sustained local transmission in Florida despite having had ample time to do so. It may at some time in the future but has not done so yet.Comparisons between Chik-V and WNV are problematic at best as they are very different diseases. Since you mentioned WNV in Texas though, remember that the unprecedented Texas epidemic of 2012 saw about 1900 cases in the state with a population of about 27 million. Compare that to Chik--V in St Barts, where the epidemic has not been particularly severe as Chik-V epidemics go, and you get an idea of the differences in transmission rates of the viruses. As far as Texas goes now, there has been a 3 year pattern of epidemics so it remains to be seen what happens this year."
"According to the Pan American Health Organisation, the number of confirmed cases on St Barths is 142, which is the comparable figure to the 11 in Florida"
"In early 2014. when the capacity of the French Caribbean islands to test blood for Chik-V was becoming overwhelmed and physicians had become familiar with the clinical symptoms, physicians were advised to only test blood when there was clinical uncertainty. The reports for Chik-V in St Barts therefore have used mainly clinically suspected cases but also include serologically confirmed cases. The PAHO records 1710 suspected cases (317 in 2015, 1393 in late 2013 and 2014) and 142 serologically confirmed cases. Validation of this approach has been done in St Martin where a study was done testing blood for evidence of prior iinfection in patients being seen for other reasons. They found that the use of suspected cases led to a slight underestimate of the true number of individuals who were infected.Apart from that, it is important to recognize that raw numbers for Florida and St Barts would not be comparable in any circumstance. Florida has about 2000 times as many residents. This is not to imply anything about the risk of travel to St Barts just to put Florida and St Barts in perspective."
"Thanks for posting this SS. We just got back and talked to someone who's family member was recovering from this. I agree it shouldn't be a huge concern but if you have a little one like we did or someone with a compromised immune system, it's not a bad idea to spray them down with repellent as you would sunscreen. And I grew up on a Bayou :)"

Epidemic is over for St Barth and St Martin according to French monitoring authorities. The report issued at the end of last week stated that only sporadic cases were identified in April. No guarantees that Chik-V (or Dengue) won't be back though so anti-mosquito precautions are still warranted.
"Just returned this weekend. Didn't see a mosquito the entire week. That could change with some rain, but we were skeeter free."
"Just got back yesterday! Really not a big deal at all. In our villa, which is on a hill that gets great breezes, we would light coils when they'd come out in the evening or early morning and that really did the trick. Only put bug spray on once or twice. Just have to stay ahead of them."
