I have today received a Christmas card from a friend in whose card I had written a little resume of our year. This had included of course our trip to the Maldives in March which we had booked as a treat to look forward to after I had a big operation last year. She wrote how wonderful the 'Maldive Therapy Centre' sounded.Just about says it all really. What a good excuse!Wid
"love it Wid, Maldive Therapy! which in my case will be to combat winter blues which of course all us brits suffer from, around Feb :-) but could strike at any time of the year if a there is a good enough deal.Edited: 8 years ago "
WidI don't need an excuse. Just lots of money! lolOD
"C'mon OD, that's simply not good enough. You can't get out of it that easily. Not having the dosh is no excuse! You defo need some therapy. Find a rich and sympathetic relative (or friend)."
sgI think there is an epidemic around the corner. They normally follow a period of frenzied jollification and good humour. Watch the faces in the supermarket today compared with next week.
I thought that the Maldives for most of us are an addiction we don't want cured! ;-)
"WidJUst fought my way around our local supermarket, doing the little bits of shopping Mrs D forgot to do yesterday! I need Maldives Therapy. Help!!OD"
"OD - Told ya!DeneBebbo - No no no, you're missing the point.. The Maldive Therapy Centre is simply there to help one live with the addiction and to give just a short respite from the symptoms. It also provides therapy to stressed individuals who have started to find bits falling off."
