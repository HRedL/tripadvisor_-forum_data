"I want to go to Japan this coming winter, but I can only go for a week. Roundtrip flights (open-jaw is much more expensive) are the same price to either. Somebody told me that doing both would be a hassle and bullet trains are expensive. As a first timer, which area should I go? I want to do both Kyoto and Tokyo, but is Osaka a good substitute for Tokyo and is skipping Kyoto worth it?"
"Welcome to the TA forums.Lots of good information about each of your proposed destinations, including suggested itineraries at www.japan-guide.com There’s no wrong answer to your question. It depends on what you’re interested in seeing."
"It depends on your interest. If you are on a budget, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and Himeji within a week will likely give you better bang for your buck. It's not that prices are much cheaper than Tokyo. However, you get to see more variety without spending lots of time and money on transport."
"Pick Tokyo if you must see the Tokyo National Museum, Disney, or want to experience the urban excitement of the largest metropolitan area in Japan.Pick Osaka/Kyoto if you want to experience historic temples and shrines. Note that Tokyo was heavily bombed during World War II, so most historic buildings were destroyed. Kyoto was not bombed during the war, so some historic buildings remain. Osaka is a huge city, so you can get an urban Japan experience there. My advice would be to skip Tokyo and spend your trip in the Kansai (Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe-Nara) area. Consider getting a JR Kansai Hiroshima Area Pass if you'd like to spend a day or two in Hiroshima. See https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html"
You might still need to be ready for quarantine two weeks if you will come this winter unless an almighty medicine for COVID-19 will be out.
"I agree that Osaka/Kyoto area, which are in the Kansai region, is a great way to experience a wide variety of what Japan has to offer. Osaka is a wonderful city, with delicious food one of its well-known highlights.https://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1105.html"
"I'm leaning towards Kyoto/Osaka. Is Osaka a good substitute for Tokyo? I love Japanese food, is food better in Osaka than Tokyo? Is Osaka also less crowded than Tokyo?Edited: 2:37 am, May 20, 2020 "
"You will get the best food in Tokyo, but many places are using non-Japanese Asians to cook, so not much difference unless you go to high-class restaurants.Anyway you might not be able to avoid the trouble with COVID-19 this coming winter. You need two more weeks before you are allowed to travel."
"Osaka/Kyoto is better almost every way you look at it. Unless there is a specific thing you really want to see in Tokyo, you'll get the same city experience in Osaka as you'd get there. And Osaka has a bit more character and the locals tend to be more chatty so it's more fun when you are traveling."
"I don't wanna go to fancy restaurants. I only want to eat traditional Japanese food, Japanese street food, etc. Is that better in Osaka or not?"
There is plenty of great food like you're looking for in all cities of Japan. It's not really an issue.
"As I wrote in #4, not much difference. If they do great, they will have a branch in Tokyo, the No.1 city in Japan.I was quite disappointed to have horrible Akashiyaki cooked by a non-Japanese who might just started working there at Dotonbori, Osaka last year.They have the ruins of Edo castle at the East Gardens in Tokyo. The Fujimi Keep is nearly 400 years old.Anyway, you have to wait and see if Japan will change the policy of border enforcements.Edited: 7:20 am, May 20, 2020 "
"I much preferred Tokyo to Osaka and would chose it every time. I’ve gone to Kyoto from Tokyo in two separate trips, once for 2 days and once for just one day and it worked out fine. It’s only a couple of hours away on the bullet train. It really depends on what you’re looking for I suppose, but on a first time trip to Japan I wouldn’t skip Tokyo."
"OP only has a week and wants to visit Kyoto. Doesn't make sense to take a day or two trip to Tokyo, unless there is something specific that they really want to visit. Kansai region has enough great things to see and do that will keep visitors busy for a month."
GUYS!!!!!!!!! Good news!!!!! My boss gave me an extra week off!!!! I can now do both!!!!! My last 4 questions are:1. Should I fly to and from Osaka or Tokyo?2. Should I get a JR Pass?3. My itinerary now looks like this (excluding landing and departure day):5 days in Tokyo2 days in Hakone6 days in Kyoto/Osaka/NaraAny suggestions for a first timer with this itinerary?
Consider flying in at Tokyo and out at Osaka - or vice versa. Otherwise - it doesn't matter where you fly in/out at. After you've sorted that out - www.japan-guide.com/railpass - rail pass calculator.
This is the current situation.https:/…page4e_001053.htmlWhere do you intend to flying from?
"Actually the price dropped for open-jaw! I'm so happy! Thank you everyone!This is my itinerary. Flying into Osaka and out of Tokyo. I plan to fly JAL for AA miles.(Feb 22) Day 0 Arrive Osaka from LAX in the eveningDay 1-7 Kansai Area (base in Osaka due to nightlife)Day 8 Hakone (ryokan experience)Day 9-12 Tokyo(March 7) Day 13 Depart Tokyo in the afternoonLast question: should I drop Hakone for a day in Tokyo? I won't be doing Universal or Disney if that helps.Edit: Based on calculations, I won't be getting a JR pass.Edited: 12:26 pm, May 20, 2020 "
"I think that staying at a ryokan would be a great and memorable experience, and would break up a very urban-centric itinerary. The only other thing I'd recommend that hasn't been mentioned yet is to pre-plan some activities, and even purchase tickets before departing the States. For instance, the Osaka Bay Aquarium is a must-see. Having these things set up will give you a lot to look forward to between periods of free time. The language barrier and culture shock can be a bit daunting for first-time visitors, so having some structure to your trip will help you feel less isolated and aimless. Booking through an agent who has experience with Japan would also be an immense help, especially with how unsure things are right now. Hopefully we are closer to being back to normal by 2021, but a professional will be able to navigate the hurdles placed by COVID-19.Good luck with your trip, I know you'll have a fantastic time!"
If you're planning to visit Hiroshima = https:/…
"I was simply referring to some of the issues you listed, such as cancellations, rebooking, and insurance. You could end up being tied up on the phone for hours getting it figured out, so it helps to have someone taking care of all that for you so there's no need to worry.I realize I didn't really explain myself in my earlier post, my apologies."
"""Good food"", especially ""best food,"" is very subjective. Osaka is known as the kitchen of Japan. I don't think it's better than Tokyo or the other way around. As long as you go to quality places (they don't have to be expensive), you will find plenty to enjoy.It's great that you can fly open jaw now. Your itinerary makes sense in general. I suggest you decide the places you want to visit beyond Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. See how many days those take up (ask here if necessary) and then we can suggest adjustments. Some places can be visited as day trips. If heading to Hiroshima/Miyajima, allowing an overnight is the best. Note that if you intend to visit Tokyo, you might not need more than a day or so at Osaka itself. In that case, basing yourself out of Kyoto to visit Osaka and Nara allows you to eliminate one hotel move. As to Osaka aquarium, I would rate it as optional depending on which aquariums you have visited in the past. If you go, you will need to allow roughly 3 hours.Finally, regarding the Covid-19 issue, just make sure whatever you book can be fully refundable, preferably in cash, not vouchers or future credit. Regarding travel insurance, make sure your policy covers Covid-19 not just for health, but for cancellations."
"Last question, should I do Hakone, Hiroshima, or somewhere else for the extra night?"
If you’re flying out at Tokyo - Hiroshima isn’t practical for your last night. Stay in Tokyo. Traveling long distances by train on your day of departure isn’t a good idea.
"Unless the number decreases in the US, your plans will end up as castles in the sand."
"It's not possible for us to determine Hakone (onsen, Mt. Fuji, natural scenery) vs Hiroshima (history, city, plus Miyajima for culture and an attractive shrine). They give you entirely different experiences. Note that Itsukushima might be covered by scaffolding though for a much needed renovation.I don't think it hurts to plan as long as whatever you book can be refunded without penalty. That's the key during the pandemic times. Anything travel plans need to have flexibility."
