After 10 weeks or so of perfectly blue skies and bird song today the blue was equally criscrossed with the everlasting vapour trails from aircraft.Tonight at 9pm I'd been sitting wtih the door open listening to the birds sing their goodnight song and it was drowned out by the rumbling of an aircraft some 40 miles away.Today we go back to where we were.Is anything changing where you are?
I too noticed a lot of vapour trails this afternoon/evening. Still not much traffic in our street but more when I walk through town. Birds as noisy as ever!
Midwest USA...yes more planes...not sure who is in them but more than before....but nothing like usual.
"We have had a bit more air traffic around Phoenix, but the flight path above us, is still quite high, so seldom hear them. However, Scottsdale airport’s vector is lower, and I have heard a few more private jets.As for traffic on the streets here, getting back to the “normal” Summer levels.Hunt"
"Wind, rain, tornado sirens, sun, repeat. That has been our day today."
The guard posts around town went down last week. We now have a bit of people in what seemed like a ghost town.
"There do seem to be more contrails recently which I must admit do fascinate me. My wife always asks where the plane is headed and I, for fun and mental stimulation, try and work out the possible route. A total waste of time of course but that's what passes for fun these days! Plenty of bird song and activity at the moment what with the house martins trying to occupy the eaves of every house in the road. Great to see but I notice some folks trying to discourage the nesting. It†s a shame but it can't be much fun having bird carp fired at you from a great height when you use your front door. Generally the countryside is looking it's best at the moment - gotta love May!"
"megthecollieWhere the plane is heading.I was in the garden when my daughter was about 3 and a plane passed overhead. I said to her "" I wonder where the plane is going? thinking USA or Spain"". She looked up and said "" It's going over there Daddy"" obviously thinking I had gone blind"
"No, still extremely few planes above Brussels and above my home.On the other hand, the noise from car traffic has mostly resumed. One reason is that many people avoid public transport, although it is uncrowded."
@8. That gave me chuckle. Kids just have a way of making us look daft!
"No change here, no traffic, no planes, nothing. Lots of people from our village still out walking, I never knew so many people lived here. Personally, we are still shielding, the forgotten lot!"
"Bemoaning maybe.It was already sad the amount of traffic just because people like to drive, rev motorbikes etc. And they had turned our rural area into the spaghetti junction of the skies. Mostly holiday makers to Spain.But I had a life then. Now still stuck in with no outside activities it is sad to see it return with no particular purpose.But if you could have seen how glorious the area looked with clean air and natural sounds I think it's bound to be sad when it's extinguished again.It was purely wonderful while it lasted - and it would be amazing if there was a half way point without the virus."
Can you see Lundy from your house Toopaz?
"HiApart from a few more cars out and about the as garden centres, etc open there is little difference in our localityHowever, overall the UK is beginning to reawaken and some idiots seem to have forgotten what staying 2 metres apart means. The media is getting a little tiresome"
I think people believe that if they act normal it will make it so. I have some sympathy with that idea so long as social distancing is observed.
"#13 'halfway point': the ecologists and green parties have defended a downsizing for cars and planes for years , but is it realistic or an utopia ?"
"RE: Post #18 - ""The corona (Sars) antibodies blood tests are becoming more available ""Yes they are, but recent studies are showing they are only about 50% accurate, so you still really don't know after being tested. ""Antibody tests for Covid-19 wrong half the time, CDC says - CNN"" https:/…index.html"
"Joyce and Dean - You're of course free to live in your dream world that all the antibody tests are highly accurate or the one you took was not one with a high false test rate, and so you can stop taking precautions any time you want. Hopefully only resulting in your chance of getting infected to be higher and not in your infecting others, who may not be able to survive the resulting illness. Personally, I'll go with the latest studies and continue to practice wearing a mask when out, maintaining safe distancing, and staying in isolation unless I absolutely need to go out. For you and the other Trump fan boys who don't believe CNN since it's obviously fake news, here is the CDC post regarding testing: https:/…antibody-tests-guidelines.html with, for me, the important part being their considerations at the end that: - Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about grouping persons residing in or being admitted to congregate settings, such as schools, dormitories, or correctional facilities.- Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace."
