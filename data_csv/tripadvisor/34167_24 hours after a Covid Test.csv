"The PLF says ""Until the screening results become available, passengers who are tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team are obliged to self-isolate at the address of their final destination as declared on their passenger locator form (PLF). ""However, the Greek Tourism Minister said yesterday (see at 4:30 min mark in the below link) that this is not true and that instead of self-isolating you just need to ""exercise caution"", ""apply common sense"" and ""not go to too many places' within 24 hours of being tested.Not sure why they are sending out 2 very different messages - but one to be aware of.https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/sociâ€¦"
It's a shame that no one said anything (unless I missed it?) - or that the PLF hasn't been updated
