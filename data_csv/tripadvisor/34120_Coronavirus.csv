Two doctors checking everyone For symptoms as we arrived yesterday but have to say was done very quickly
Good news-----------------that's the last thing we want here !
What did they check?
They have scanners to take your temperature. There were 4 when we came through. The kiosk also asks about China etc.
We travel(hope we travel) to Barbados in 3 weeks. Considering the number of people that travel around the world every day we feel confident that we are in safe hands.It is comforting to know that Barbados is on the ball.
"Anyone know what is happening with the cruise ship Britannia in Bridgetwon? She left yesterday, but immediately turned around and returned to port. Her tenders are now active in the harbour."
"We aren't going to cruise with them, actually Royal Clipper in March. Just was wondering what is going on. Hopefully not corona. Thanks."
"We were in Barbados for 2 weeks, Jan 18 - Feb. 1. We saw posters outside the restrooms advising people of the corona virus and reminding people to wash their hands.I was very impressed that they were getting the message out and reminding people to wash their hands. Poor medical care is a huge part of why people are dying in China.I was sick in Barbados and went to Dr. Smith near coral sands and he was great! I just had the deep cough, no fever, but I wanted to salvage what I could of my vacation. I got a 3 day zpack, steroids, and two inhalers. My second week of vacation was good, thanks to Dr. Smith. It was good to know he was there and the pharmacy was right around the corner.Make sure you get some trip insurance. I usually buy a small policy from allianz. They are extremely difficult to get a claim paid, but these policies are good to have for catastrophic claims."
"Thanks for sharing Chris, we are travelling on April, hopefully, but always keep an eye on the situation there in order to avoind staying stuck at our arrival or worse, getting ill. Everyone here, please keep on posting news. Laura"
"Do they allow anyone visited China to enter Barbados? I’m holding a Hong Kong passport and live in Hong Kong, I’m worried if I will have difficulties entering the country as I’m flying in from the UK. Have not been to Mainland China for the past 14 days."
You probably will be allowed in but may have to face a 14 day quarantine.
Cheers for the heads up and quick reply! I thought the same of possibility 2 wks quarantine and I only plan to visit for a week. I’ve tried to look up information online but it’s insufficient
Are in the Uk now? When fo you fly to Barbados?
"Im in Hong Kong now but planning to fly into London on 8 March then to Barbados on either 15 or 21 March, haven’t booked anything yet cuz of the uncertainty."
"Winniec667 - I would NOT take the chance, better to avoid travel, check the US Travel Advisories, I believe Hong Kong is at high risk. Do NOT bring the Covid -19 to Barbados.....stay home."
"This is on UK Government site about traveling to Barbados.“ Barbados has no confirmed cases of coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, with immediate effect the Government of Barbados has announced that individuals who have visited Hubei Province (China) within the past 14 days will be placed in quarantine at the local Infection Control Centre. Individuals who have been to other parts of China, and countries other than China who might have been affected by the virus in the past 14 days will be screened and if necessary placed in home quarantine.”In circumstances, probably not worth booking a flight to Barbados."
IMO the problem with that approach is it is relying on the honesty of the traveller if travel can not be traced via ticketing/passport. Can a passport scan (at kiosk or officer) track the traveller with dates? If it does why would they ask at the kiosk?
We’re currently in lock down at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife and the thought of 10 beautiful days in November in Barbados is keeping us going!!
I think I heard on the news today that a Cruise ship had been denied entry today . Anyone listen properly ?
"winniec667I would not risk being quarantined nor risk spreading the virus to the caribbean... if you haven't booked, perhaps it's better to reconsider?Edited: 12:40 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"As we were waiting for our flight on the 21 February back to the uk I heard a loud argument taking place with a Chinese man in his late twenty’s and the Barbados police,this went on for twenty minutes with the Chinese man backing off as the police tried to calm him down,I overheard the police telling him they will keep him for 14 days if necessary in the end the Chinese man went off with the Barbados police"
"Hi, is this check done at airport arrivals?"
Yes just before you enter the immigration hall. Three or four medical personnel take your temperature with a scanner.
"I'm curious on what happens if you have a fever but havent been to China or traveled anywhere recently. Lots of people can just have a regular virus/cold and still be running a fever, right? I'm traveling in April to the Caribbean with kids. Hope none of us are sick at the time but it would be awful to get turned around when you dont actually have Coronavirus."
Hi VT - I was thinking the exact same thing.It's worrying (as it should be).CheersAndy
VT are they screening at departure in US airports?
"Yeah - but the hotels and condo accoms are taking advantage. Advance booking has to be paid before arrival at exorbitant NON-refundable rates. And refundable rates are even higher i.e. double.Edited: 5:14 pm, February 26, 2020 "
So they have stopped temperature screening now?
"As this thing is a virus, antibiotics will not do anything to help, except peace of mind. Unneeded antibiotics aren’t good for us. It is a virus, and will run its course Iin your body. So good hygiene, hand washing and eat properly. And plenty of fluids to stay hydrated."
"I am pretty sure if you have a temp, that they will then check you for the virus. They may not want to needlessly test someone, with no fever. But the fact someone can be exposed two weeks before showing symptoms, is what bothers me."
I have no idea if they are screening at departure at US Airports. I don't fly until late April.
"Westiegal3,I think that what you heard was that a cruise ship had been turned away from Ocho Rios in Jamaica because one of the passengers had the virus. I'm supposed to be going to Ocho Rios just after Easter, so I'm watching what's happening there very carefully. A lot can happen in the intervening six and a half weeks - at the moment the situation changes every day."
Thanks Berbican .
VT it seems that US airports do not screen outgoing passengers and Canby says Barbados does not screen incoming passengers. So if you have a fever only you would know so there shouldn't be any problem flying to Barbados.
"It now appears that the passenger in question did not have the virus, but ordinary 'flu. Obviously, the Jamaican authorities didn't want to take any chances. There is more information on the Jamaica forum, including links to articles in the Gleaner and the Observer. In Britain there have - so far - been thirteen cases of the virus, and it is predicted that many more people will die this winter from ""ordinary 'flu"" than from ""Coronavirus""."
Just got back from flying through Barbados last week and they check your temperature when coming into immigration. This unfortunately is not effective. Actually regular influenza is way more virulent just not quite as contagious. This is another blown out of proportion news story. Just go enjoy your vacation.
supposed to be flying to barbados in less than 3 weeks. Concerned because coming with my 11 yr old daughter. Should we cancel to err on the side of caution?
Why? - unless one is going to stay in permanent quarantine in one's own home - anywhere could suddenly be discovered to have a mysteriously arrived case... None here at present AFAIK
Do you have China listed on your passport close to that date?
Arrived onFeb. 24 from Montreal with Air Canada… Arrived Early at 1:30 PM… No doctors there nor any temperature checks at the airport.... Smooth sailing all the way and was at my apartment within an hour.
"That’s the problem imo no one wants to end up inadvertently quarantined during their vacation. Look at Tenerife, the main complaint is lack of clear communication."
Jodi H. Why should you cancel? There is no Coronavirus in Barbados. Don't know where you are coming from. Are you coming from China?
"We are heading for Barbados next week. Later in our trip we are taking a Clipper cruise from Bridgetown. Just received the following message.Star Clippers have received confirmation that St. Lucia is issuing a 14 day quarantine for all persons that have past travel history or transit history (14 days) through Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Italy and Singapore. This means any passenger who visited/travelled to/from any of the above mentioned countries within 14 days of arrival in St. Lucia will not be allowed to disembark/visit St. Lucia. Thus, needing to remain on the Ship at this Port of Call."
"shannonlw2017 has hit the nail on the head. I am no more afraid of Coronavirus than I am of ordinary 'flu. In over 80% of cases Coronavirus symptoms are mild. What I am afraid of is coming to the Caribbean and either not being allowed in, or - worse still - being quarantined for 14 days."
"I hate to be ""Debbie Downer"", but it's only a matter of time when Barbados has it's first case. It has just been announced that a case has been declared in South America. Canadians are being told to prepare for a pandemic, stock up on medications, and stockpile food. Before you travel, I strongly suggest you read the latest Travel Advisories."
Mel are they now filling prescriptions before renewal date? Where are these drugs coming from? Won't that create a shortage now much like when they re-called blood pressure meds made in China and India due to contamination? Doesn't make sense to me.
"I'm just repeating what has been advised by the Minister of Health in Ontario, at least 3 times over the last 2 days."
I read that too Mel - How the devil am I supposed to stock up on groceries and meds in the GTA when I don;t fly home until May?
What is the current situation at the airport? It is written everywhere that travelers have to stay in quarantine for 14 days. We are coming next week from Germany
Exactly ASO but then the advice is from the federal Minister of Health so I'd take it with a grain of salt. Another Liberal idea not thought out.
Meriam AFAIK they are no longer checking arriving passengers so unless you ask for medical assistance they would not know if you are carrying the virus. Who is saying arriving passengers must go into 14 day quarantine? How would that even be possible?
It is written in the entry requirements for Barbados from the foreign office in Germany
"The main concern I would have as a visitor (not just to Barbados) is that the virus is such a rapidly developing problem, The situation now will not be the situation next week, who knows what travel restrictions will be put in place (if any). We would normally have a holiday overseas booked by now for May but we have delayed committing to anything until the situation becomes clearer.Sadly the media love whipping these things up into a frenzy and I dislike the way they report the number of cases, they only issue numbers for the total amount of cases, no mention of those that have had it and are now recovered, Personally I would be more concerned about catching the flu than coronavirus.Edited: 6:38 am, February 28, 2020 "
"JGD in Canada they report the number of confirmed cases and number of deaths, usually by country. They also add the number of suspected cases in Canada waiting for lab results. They remind us of the number of people who die each year from the regular flu. I'm not sure how else they should report the information, maybe it is more hyped up in the UK.My concern is how contagious it is and how it may evolve. They don't know a lot about the virus yet or what it may do in the future. Plus this is yet another deadly virus to add to ones we already have. They do have a vaccine already but they have to start clinical trials. May be ready by next year..."
"NC, yes the total number of confirmed cases which includes all who have either got it now or had it in the past, I would like to see the number of people who are currently infected. For example, in the UK we had 13 cases up to a day or so ago, we have had 5 new cases due to people returning from Italy and Iran, the 13 cases are weeks old and the sufferers must have made a recovery by now so, in reality, we have 5 people with Coronavirus, not 18."
"I see your point. It would be better if they reported total infections, number of deaths, current infections and when the 14 day window closes. Then we would see how quickly it is spreading into each country."
"With no way to predict when the outbreak will end,Can. travellers are advised to look into cancellation policies for trips to overseas locations.They might be uninsurable and have their future claims denied because advisories were in place at the time of their bookings. (as of now there are 7 countries on the list).At present and hopefully it continues - Barbados has not reported any casesEdited: 8:00 am, February 28, 2020 "
Exactly my point NC
"We are traveling to Barbados in ten days from the US. We have trip insurance, but would prefer not to cancel. However, the Fascination cruise ship had a crew member who was tested before any passengers were allowed to disembark. He/she tested negative. St. Lucia wouldn't even test the crew member--just denied docking. I read above that St. Lucia is now instituting a ban re. cruises with passengers from several countries. Yet Barbados seems to be much less restrictive. The governor (or prime minister) had a press conference and said people were overreacting. Is she more concerned with protecting businesses who benefit from the cruise ship passengers than the residents and tourists who pay a ton of money to visit the island? Wish I had booked a trip to St.Lucia!!"
"wowow.. Off-duty...really?? maybe you should reroute your trip to St. Lucia then... I'm reading more fear mongering than anything else in the most recent posts. As far as ASO and other Canadians are concerned.. what medications are you told to take.. considering we don't really know that much about this particular illness. and stop up on food.?? you are kidding right.as for St. Lucia.. they advised they don't have any way of testing for this particular virus and that's the reason they didn't allow the ship into port. Barbados health officials have a quarantine area set up and testing is available. and you can damn well bet our PM isn't ""more concerned with protecting the businesses who benefit from the cruise ship passengers than the residents or tourists"" .. She's taking it all in.. listening to our health officials and others and be reasonable about the whole situation..."
Sunnie - my point is that it's ridiculous to tell Cans. who are not in Canada that we need to stockpile food and meds...? - I sure as hell can;t go to my Can. supermarket or drugstore and follow that recommendation!! I am not scheduled to return until May... (I have my fingers crossed that it will be less of an Issue then)
"@Canby - I really must remember to address my comments to the particular poster...@Sunnie""As far as ASO and other Canadians are concerned.. what medications are you told to take.. considering we don't https://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada… know that much about this particular illness. and stop up on food.?? you are kidding right.""Edited: 7:26 pm, February 28, 2020 "
The authorities in Canada are saying stock up on necessities and meds if you want. However you should always have enough emergency supplies for 2 weeks in case of natural disasters. There is only a small % of any population thst are vulnerable of extreme reaction to this or any other type of the flu virus.
"1.. I haven't been told what medications TOO take if I end up with this virus.. .. but if I'm reading this correctly, I'm guessing they are wanting you to stock up on any OTHER medications you may be taking.. but really?? If that's not fear mongering, I'm not sure what is.and just to add. The Carnival Fascination (as have other Carnival ships in the last 15 ish years) have had Bajans AND mostly English passengers, sailing from Barbados round trip back to Barbados. So.. the other thing about MIA going onboard.. was to assure her 40ish citizens.. and the 100 plus English people that were all due to disembark today, that they would be able to.."
Sunnie - I personally feel Minister Patty Hajdu going overboard with her recommendations - But she is the elected Can.Min. for Health so guess it is her right ...(I can;t do it anyhow - so I will just continue enjoying my Bajan winter stay)
"The recommendation to fill prescription medications is based on the fact that there are many drugs that are made with ingredients from Either China or India. It’s about supply chain disruptions. The FDAalready placed one such drug on it’s list of shortages yesterday, the supplier stated it was due to Coronavirus.Edited: 9:51 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Shannon so have rules changed and will they now fill prescriptions before the refill date? Will this not create a shortage now with people stockpiling. When I left Canada at the end if Jan there was a shortage of irbesartan because of recalls (contamination) of other meds in the same family and patients being switched over to irbesartan. I had a devil of a time getting enough to cover me while down here and the drug I am on wasn't even the ones recalled. The Minister's recommendation will create the same situation with everyone stockpiling meds. Not only do I think it is not sound or logical advice it is a little excessive. I mean storing extra amounts of food (more than usual for most Canadians) is a little over the top. Canada is not northern Italy or Iran. We have had 13 cases, no deaths and a good health care system. IMO the Minister should be helping people keep things in perspective, not whipping things up. Let's not panic."
"Canby this is her recommendation https:/…eef343e3-e611-496c-8def-a648bd4698c9""OTTAWA — Health Minister Patty Hajdu is encouraging Canadians to stockpile food and medication in their homes in case they or a loved one should fall ill with the novel coronavirus, despite the relatively low risk of contracting the disease in Canada.""Edited: 6:15 am, February 29, 2020 "
Instead of stockpiling can people not do online food shopping if suddenly quarantined? Obviously that can’t be done for meds though.

"Jackie I don't think its about the quarantined person, anyone can bring food and meds to the door. I think they are thinking of a supply failure due to so many people becoming infected.Has anyone read whether you become immune after infection or not?"
"Canby, a man in Japan became the first coronavirus sufferer to have the virus a second time."
"Considering the way China handled the outbreak early on, I wouldn't rely on them for accueate information.I found this...""The Japanese woman initially had mild symptoms of coronavirus infection and tested positive in late January. She was released from the hospital on Feb. 1. She tested positive again on Wednesday after coming in for a sore throat and chest pain.""""One worrisome possibility is that the coronavirus follows what is known as a biphasic infection: the virus persists and causes a different set of symptoms than observed in the initial bout."" That would be much like ebola, dengue or chickengunya.Edited: 7:34 am, February 29, 2020 "
That’s what I said. Just order food for delivery including groceries. Call in prescription and have Neighbour pick up. It’s possible lol
The US just announced their first death I am thinking things are about to get a whole lot worse in Barbados.
"I suspect that after March break, with thousands of folks flying all over the world, we will see a huge increase in the number of cases. That's when it could become very scary, contrary to what the President is saying. I'm in Toronto, and every day they announce more individual cases. I have just returned from my pharmacy, and the pharmacist has back ordered all my medications. He agrees that shortages will be inevitable at some point."
"Why after March? People are travelling all the time. I know school holidays are busy but older retirees (us included) take up the slack out of season I think. Tenerife is at it’s busiest January to April.Edited: 5:05 pm, February 29, 2020 "
I think this thread has run its course. It is full of supposition and nothing else.
Agreed.
"Hear hear !Time to shut down this ridiculous thread of fear, misinformation and personal opinion."
"Sunset, please point out the misinformation. I think it is better to correct that information rather than leave it as is. If you shutdown the thread without correcting it the misinformation stays posted, as is, for ever. Opinion? This is a forum and forums are a place for discussion. Discussion by definition is ""an activity in which people talk about something and tell each other their ideas or opinions.""... Cambridge Dictionary. Many on here have previously suggested that if one becomes disappointed or bored with a thread that one simply moves on. Personally, I welcome all opinions as long as they adhere to TA guidelines and are well-mannered."
"Sunset, without the right to express personal opinions where would this forum be? How would we answer questions such as ""what is the best way to change sterling to Bajan dollars?"" or ""Is it safe to ride a bicycle on main roads in Barbados?"" Both these questions would require an opinion which by definition is ""a thought or belief about something or someone"""
Yes you will. Probably won’t be able to get into UK even.
"So I read an article on the stockpiling issue. The writer's opinion was that as the number of quarantined households increases, the more stress will be placed on delivery systems. They argued that frustrations and delays with delivery will cause people to nip out themselves, and hat will jeopardize quarantine. This was all in aid of trying to protect the more vulnerable people in society by trying to limit the spread as much as possible. Remember, there are symptom-free people spreading it also, so a healthy family member who is quarantined with an ill one may unwittingly spread the virus to others. Their argument was an attempt to ""flatten the curve"" - i.e. minimize that huge spike in the ""number of cases"" curve that occurs at the height of any epidemic. If the curve spikes too high it puts a huge strain on all services and more people will die, either because they cannot get timely help, or because people are forced to break quarantine and spread the virus further. Take that opinion as you will."
Interesting Bajanswife-(so our Health Min. Hadju isn't as crazy as I had thought)
"The food issue I can see but explain to me how one gets medication from the pharmacy before the renewal date? Have insurance companies and the government relaxed the rules so the Minister's advice will work? Explain how a sudden surge in requests for drugs (to stockpile at home) will not deplete the supply available, especially when a lot of drugs are made in China."
"You can get meds before the renewal date but the catch is, insurance won't pay. My kids are asthmatic and I'm trying to get a few extra puffers before we head to Barbados for March break. The pharmacist filled me in on this tidbit that I wasn't aware of."
"I was talking about personal opinions as it relates to this topic. Obviously not about bicycle safety or changing money. I believe everyone has a right to their own opinion. But on this subject, unless you are on the front lines, the last place to go for advice should be a travel forum."
"I think you are right Chrisky regarding getting extra meds just because Hajdu says to.This is all part of the thread because mel2007 Toronto posted:""48 of 99 ·I hate to be ""Debbie Downer"", but it's only a matter of time when Barbados has it's first case. It has just been announced that a case has been declared in South America. Canadians are being told to prepare for a pandemic, stock up on medications, and stockpile food. Before you travel, I strongly suggest you read the latest Travel Advisories"" I can see how this could affect people leaving Canada for a holiday and those returning who have been out of touch for a few weeks or months."
"With respect, this has turned into a discussion more about what might or might not happen in Canada than Barbados. I think getting dengue in Barbados is more likely that Covid-19."
The first Co vid cases have been confirmed in the Caribbean honestly its inevitable for the virus to reach all through out the world.
"Well, the Bajan government has identified a place for Coronavirus sufferers to be housed, just pray you don't need to be sent to this abandoned naval station that was once a prison!!Details herehttps:/…"
"Oh my Gosh, let's pray thevirus will never get the Island!"
"I am watching closely here in the US. Supposed to be back for a week Aprl 5th. I predict it will eventually hit just about every where. But when and how hard is the question. Public spaces, community spread is a worry. I visit and go to a lot of public spaces. The airports. So many people from so many places. I am healthy,just over 50. More so than worrying about becoming fatally ill. Though if sick enough to need care I would like it to be at home. Also slight concern about getting guaranteed not sick. There or on way home. Would rather be in my house for that too!So I see how the next few weeks progress and decide from there.."
"For those who are interested, confirmed cases of caronavirus are now being reported from the DR and St. Barth's (patients are in a St. Martin hospital).Nine out of 27 have died in the US (Washington state). Five of them in a senior's home. 231 are under public health supervision... USA Today."
Are there now restrictions on travellers from Italy going to Barbados?
@Ellejaya: We called yesterday the embassy in Brussels and they are told that entry stops apply to Italy for Europe. We were interested in Germany
"Well,I guess I have to say goodbye to my holidays so. Great :-("
"I would suggest you call your airline and the Barbados embassy to see what, if any, travel restrictions are in place"
"Hi Meriam !And what did the embassy tell you About Germany ? As we are supposed to fly March 13th from Frankfurt to Bridgetown.. !?!Kind regards,Chris"
I would think people will be more likely to get a cold or flu by just going through an airport or sat on a plane for numerous hours. Most travellers know this and it hasn't stopped anyone flying in the past. Ok this virus is more serious for certain people but they are a minority not a majority. Hopefully the media will find something else soon to put everyone into a panic and the Coronavirus will become yesterdays news.
"rossendalelass, got to agree with you regarding the media, they love a bit of doom and gloom and this has sent them into a frenzy, I have stopped watching the news as it just winds me up lol. There is never a mention of how many people have had it and are now recovered as this would be positive news."
"Well, the island of Grenada is seriously considering a complete travel ban on ANY country that have any cases of Corona virus. That would therefore include Canada, US, and the UK. No flights or cruise ships coming from, or have any passengers from these countries will be denied entry.Wonder if Barbados is thinking about this as well.Edited: 12:41 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"JGD Canada has had 33 confirmed cases, 26 active, 7 recovered. UK, 85 cases, 77 active, 8 recovered. No deaths for either country. The numbers are out there. I think the news sources are reporting on the number of new cases, cases in total and following how quickly it is spreading because of its contagiousness."
"Just to share with you, I live in Lombardy, Italy. And trust me, this is not a flu. And, moreover, I don't believe that cases are that small in the other countries."
"The problem with a new virus like this is that nobody has immunity to it yet, and it is clear that a certain number of those infected will need hospital assistance. If this spreads freely around communities the hospitals and clinics will be overwhelmed and more people will die than expected due to lack of special care. Whereas with the normal seasonal flu viruses the hospitals and clinics seem to have been able to keep up with the number of cases that developed complications and needed special care. And there's a whole domino effect from having so many people ill at one time. This is why some countries are taking drastic measures. Grenada, for example, is probably aware that their medical system couldn't handle a widespread infection. Not sure ours can here in Barbados either, but we are perhaps in a better position than Grenada."
"NC, you are getting better info than we get here in the UK, I only ever see total numbers of cases."
"Barbados adds Iran to list of countries facing QuarantineArticle byBarbados TodayPublished onMarch 4, 2020Iran and three districts in northern Italy have now joined the list of countries on Barbados’ quarantine list for COVID-19.With immediate effect, all arriving passengers who have been in Iran, or Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna or Verona in Italy in the previous 14 days will be required to report to Port Health at the points of entry.Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kenneth George, said these passengers will be interviewed by port health officers and sent to mandatory quarantine.The type of quarantine is determined by the level of risk of exposure. Low-risk individuals, he explained, are sent to home quarantine while moderate to high-risk individuals are sent to mandatory quarantine.Quarantine measures are already in place for passengers who have been in Hubei Province in China and South Korea during the previous 14 days.In making the announcement today, the Ministry of Health and Wellness also added Iran and the three districts in northern Italy to the list of places to which non-essential travel should be avoided. Other countries on this list are China and South Korea.Residents of Barbados are also being advised to take enhanced precautions in terms of their respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene when travelling to areas where community spread of COVID-19 has been reported, including Washington State, California and Oregon in the United States. (BGIS)"
"It won't take long before the US and Canada and the UK, plus most all of Europe will be added to the list. Best to hunker down and stay put for the foreseeable future."
"Arrived today. Everyone had their temperature taken at airport. New electronic checkin was a breeze. The only countries asked about on the system (that I remember) were recent visits to China and South Korea. May have been Iran too but pretty sure Italy was not included.Concerned to hear about Grenada considering bans. We are joining Royal Clipper on 14 th and Grenada is our first port of call.Edited: 9:00 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"If you go to Nowgrenada.com, there is today's follow up with the press from yesterday's Prime Minister's speech. There is no way that Grenada would be able to cope with an outbreak, and it was specifically noted that countries identified with the virus breakout, according to them, would NOT be allowed to enter. They also mentioned cruise ships, and reiterated that the situation is fluid and is being assessed daily."
"mel2007Toronto Unfortunately, my wife and kids have been excited about travelling to Barbados at the end of this month for the past year... so very hard for us to cancel our plans.Also would be a great loss to us financially, in between flights, hotels and car rental, which has all already been paid for....Yes, we have insurance but dealing with the insurance company js always a nightmare...Would you advise travelling IF no symptoms?"
"Surprised to hear that there is screening again at the airport. They had stopped that last week (when Canby came in). Wonder why they have gone back to it. Anyone have any ideas. Perhaps a Caricom agreement since all of this was duscussed at the recent meeting. I'm wondering if Barbados' or any island health care system could handle a break out.Enjoy your holiday Damasust.Edited: 4:04 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Harry, if there’s no symptoms and no travel restrictions for your country I don’t see why you shouldn’t travel. Consult the information provided by your government and the Bajan authorities beforehand but I would not base my decision on whether to go on a holiday based on the opinions of unknown people on this forum. I know, I know, everyone has the right to their opinion. But you’ll find 10 different opinions from 10 different people so my personal advice is to stick to the official channels of communication."
"Bajanswife,you are better prepared here than many other countries-we had to visit a Dr on the South Coast yesterday because my wife has a slight gum infection.The Dr was VG,did a complete check and diagnosis-in talking with her(she spent over half an hour with us!)the Covid-19 virus came up.She explained she works on the emergency team and Barbados ordered the testing kits in last month,have had training and are getting a quarantine facility ready on the North side of the island,in case that is necessary.She also explained their procedure for cruise ships,as u probably know they turned one away and inspected two cruise lines last week before allowing them in.She was extremely knowledgeable,and IMO Barbados has taken this seriously and is far better prepared than we would have expected!"
"Very bleak outlook in the UK with currently,90 cases and our Chief Medical Officer talking about the inevitability of a widespread epidemic and resultant deaths.Frankly,do not see how the Caribbean Islands,Barbados included can cope with this worldwide pandemic particularly well,although Barbados does claim to have 150 beds available for persons who have contracted the virus and need to be quarantined in a former PRISON."
"Jamminpete.... to the best of my knowledge as someone who lives here, we , Barbados, has not turned any cruise ship away. There was an issue last week with Carnival Fascination being turned away from St. Lucia and coming into Barbados a day early, but it was cleared and passengers allowed to depart.. 40plus Bajans sailed Barbados to Barbados round trip and over 100 UK passenger had to get back home. no COVID-19 onboard."
Barbados denied entry to Caribbean Princess on Feb 8 due to gastroenteritis cases on board. Other islands have denied entry to ships due to caronavirus.
"Johnfrancis51, why do you say the outlook is “very bleak”, for the UK????, do you know something the rest of us don’t???.Surely we are in no “bleaker” position that any other country when it comes to this virus."
"Yes Doogie I agree, I don't see why we would be in a worse situation than any other nation, in some respects I would say we are better off than most with the NHS to watch over us."
"I have written an email to Italian consul in Barbados and she said that there is no restriction for italian visitors. So,the situation isn't clear at all. What she says anyway is that the situation is changing minute by minute in the whole world, and this is a reality. What scares me is what could happen if me and my husband get very sick... who will take care of our daughter in the island? I am personally not taking the risk."
"Rissolalaura, I think you are wise not to take the risk. Having a child with you changes things compeletely."
NC.. no ship has been denied to do COVID-19. by the way.. we have our fare share of Gastro issues on the island. it's not pleasant.. and unfortunate that this was the reason they didn't allow this ship in.
"Yes Sunnie, that is what I posted."
"We were on the RC in Feb. They were taking everyone’s temperature and recent medical history and where you’d been. You’ll need to get the forms, fill them in, then get in another queue. Took about an hour + on checking in but worth it. You’ll love the experience."
"Just to keep you posted. Italian counsul just sent me an update.They put restriction for all italian visitors. So, if you are italian don't start your journey."
Hi I'm going to Barbados in a couple of weeks from England are they still letting people in. Should I be worried.
"From a personal perspective,I would be looking to defer your travel plans until the virus is under control, rather than climbing.Entry in and out of UK airports is currently allowed without any health checks by PHE,which is totally negligent.Would not be happy sitting in a cabin for over eight hours with some 200 or more passengers in such a confined space, where any virus could flourish,but at the end of the day,it is a personal decision.Good luck."

Interesting article in B'Today re prices/virus...?https:/…
"The US is beginning to deploy test kits which they say are very accurate and within a few weeks they may begin to actually test people who they think are potential carriers. You can go for weeks without symptoms so this temperature taking isn’t preventing anything. Our authorities so far have said that people over 55 especially if’s they have lung, heart or diabetes health issues are the people who have had the most serious cases including death. They are advised to limit travel and large group gatherings. They are saying that younger people mostly have mild cases and no serious symptoms. They say this data includes worldwide results. I think it will seriously curtail travel among older people. All 11 people who died in US fit the profile. At work locations where anywhere tested positive people are working from home. Just sayin... expect serious business impact. It can’t be long until UK is giving similar advice."
"Marmite19, I’m surprised to see Spain on that list when France and Germany have far more cases. I imagine the UK will be at those levels in a few weeks so maybe we won’t be allowed in. Can’t imagine the impact that will have on the island."
"An already fragile local economy will inevitably go into melt down when the current corona virus escalates and as many financial experts predict , a worldwide depression follows, making the 2008 crash look like a walk in the park, despite Trump's rhetoric.This is just the start of the steep decline."

Good point Marmite19. Hadn’t thought of that. I guess there’s nothing we can do except keep an eye on things. I think you are in a slightly better position than I am travelling in 4 weeks time. Who knows what the situation will be by then. Keeping everything crossed.
"I've been warching comments on this forum like many of you. My flight is set to arrive in Barbados Mar 29 from Toronto. I have until Mar 21 to cancel...Really ""on the fence"" right now....My main concern is becoming ill then not being able to get home."

I realize a lot an change between now and then but Can anyone confirm if this is actually the current policy ?

Chris 209 I would suggest contacting the airline you are flying out with. As things seem to be changing daily everywhere in the world right now and every one has different facts and thoughts as to what might / will and is happening. I am meat to be arriving in just under 2 weeks so I will update on here. Good luck.
"chris209, if in doubt I would email the relevant department.This is from the UK current travel advice website information.""Barbados has no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19). As a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, the Government of Barbados will put anyone arriving in Barbados who has visited Hubei Province (China), Iran, Northern Italy (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna or Veneto) and South Korea within the past 14 days into quarantine. Individuals who have visited other parts of China in the past 14 days will be screened and if necessary placed in quarantine. On March 7, the Government of Barbados announced that it was extending its quarantine protocol to the whole of Italy. Persons arriving in Barbados who had previously been in Italy in the past 14 days will be quarantined. The Government of Barbados is also advising residents of Barbados against all non-essential travel to Italy.""Obviously this can change as the virus spreads so best to keep checking with relevant government websites and your air travel provider"
"Arrived in Barbados Friday and they are still checking everyone before entering the Arrivals area. I had a mild cold and passed, no problem. Didn't see them stop anyone from entering. Took about half hour longer getting through. Lovely rum punch by the baggage carousel!"
I will just keep an eye on things and watch the government advisories as we get closer to travel time. 12 weeks seems excessive - we will have been back from Spain 8 weeks before we go to Barbados and that’s well beyond the incubation period so hopefully we will be able to keep our travel plans.
Seems odd including Spain. I wonder why?
"Barbados Government Information Services has a Facebook site posting updatesLatest update posted yesterday, says all Passengers arriving from Italy will follow the quarantine protocols of 14 days"
Spain is not currently on the list.
I didn’t think so but someone mentioned it earlier which is why I was curious.
It is going to be very hard to police anyone who has been to Italy from another EU country as that information will not show up on passports. A very important flaw in the EU open border policy.Again they can ban flights from Italy but it doesn't stop someone from Italy travelling to another EU country and boarding a plane to Barbados.
We hope to be visiting in 2 weeks. We have been very careful and we avoid going out only when we have to. I am bring Clorox wipes with me on the plane can't wait to swim and sun in the most beautiful place on earth.
"I see the Cruise ship Costa Magica was anchored off Port for most of yesterday. It appears they let it it to dock late afternoon, but (i assume) after taking in supplies it set sail again early evening. Cant find much about it yet online but it was turned away from T&T earlier this week as well."
I lived in Barbados you'll will be quarantined if all well you have permission to entry
No stay where you are
Definitely not if you have visited China !
"Canadians and Americans FYII have copied the following from another Caribbean forum. I have been following a few of them since most are discussing caronavirus...""Just spoke to the Consul General in Toronto, and he advised that the situation is changing daily, and yes, it is very possible that both the US and Canada could be on the list of banned countries in the next couple of weeks. I have just cancelled my flight leaving in April.""I would suggest you keep abreast of the situation and make appropriate decisions. If they ban flights from Canada and US I'm not sure how those of us in the Caribbean would get home. The airlines are not going to fly empty planes down to get us.

"Chrisky, he didn't say Canada was banned. He said the situation changes daily and that Canada could become banned."

First case of coronavirus recorded in Jamaica.Brought in by a Jamaican female who had returned from the UK.
"Giving people a heads up may convince them to keep up to date on the situation, be prepared to make alternate plans if things go bad and to register with the gov't when going abroad.I call it being informed and prepared. I don't see any scare mongering in what was posted. He was relaying what a government official said to him.I agree Canby, things are changing daily and as the situation changes the changes come faster. A few days ago the States didn't have any deaths related to caronavirus, as of Friday they have had 17 and confirmed cases are now in over half the states."
Thanks NC for the reminder to register. I always do but totally forgot this time.
Yes thanks NC - I've never bothered but have now done it
NC I appreciate your info. I find it very factual. No fear mongering there. I wonder if Air Canada would allow for rebooking if Canada banned.... Probably as they are for Italy.

Tracy - off topic but where are you staying? We arrive on Friday. Staying on the west coast. Wish I could find some sort of hand sanitizer here. It's been sold out for weeks now.
The problem with this recipe is that if you choose to use any brand Vodka (as stated) most will only have 40% alcohol. Needs to be at least 60% to be effective.

@casperjj- we are staying on the south side. Having older kids with us they love the big surf and going to the Gap. I think I must have gotten the last 4 pack of Purell off Amazon that was not an inflated place. It just arrived yesterday. Crazy how every store is sold out. I did hear that Bath and Bodyworks has travel hand sanitizer that is over 60% alcohol. They are all scented but at least it works!!
Safe travel Tracy D. i do have some of the small bottles from BBW. My teen boys would much prefer it without scent :-) I might try to make my own. Just concerned about getting the percentage right.
Johnfrancis for those of us not familiar with UK papers is the Daily Mail reliable?

https:/…AlcoholCanby the concentration of alcohol must be at least 60% to be the most effective.
"Barbados Tourism 'Under Attack"".. I think not. Under Attack would be every one on TripAdvisor telling everyone how bad the country is and making false statements about restaurants etc.. and people not booking, or cancelling, for those reasons.This is a really unfortunate situation in the health sector world wide, which has spilled over into people not traveling. It took a while for people to get on an airplane again after 9/11 (or I should say.. without fear).. and travel from England curtailed because of mad cow disease (remember the alcohol mats at the bottom of the stairs and the questions about ""have you been on a farm in the last x number of days/weeks"".. Anyway.. it's my opinion. We aren't ""under attack"" because it's not just WE.. it's many many tourist industries... and it's not man made.."
Canby when you mix the alcohol with the gel etc. you are diluting it. How will you make dure it is at 60+% when all mixed?

"As with any journalism in the UK, I wouldn't trust Daily Mail as far as I could through it. I wouldn't say it makes up news but I am afraid it is sloppy and sensational. As for gel, soap and water is more effective!"
"NC, the WHO recommends minimum 75% for ethanol based cleansers and 80% for isopropanol based cleansers. The recommended starting materials are 95% ethanol or 99.8% isopropanol.The former is not available to most of us without a prescription. The lucky Aussies can make their own.The latter is available but most rubbing alcohol formulations are 70%.The WHO also has a list of surface cleansers than can be used instead of wipes. This includes products such as Lysol bathroom cleanser."
"NSIPA the CDC recommends 60% to 90% as seen in the link I provided. With the way the WHO has handled the ebola and zika outbreak (and even carona) I tend to trust CDC more. Having worked in hospitals, clinics and medical labs I know it is 70% alcohol that is used."
the are no restrictions in Barbados
"Oh, I assumed the rubbing alcohol available in Barbados was 100% alcohol and mixed it 2 to 1 with glycerin as a hand sanitizer.Is this no good then?"
"Too late to edit above post.Just looked at my bottle of Barbados rubbing alcohol and it is marked ""Not Diluted"" so guess that means it is 100% alcohol and therefore my hand sanitizer formulation is OK."
It cant be 100% alcohol. There has to be some other ingredient.
I think good old soap and hot water will do me. Especially as trying to buy hand sanitizer is impossible and making it is a faff.
"Yes, Jackiee19 soap and hot water best but not always possible when out and about, on plane etc."
True I suppose.

Totally agree Westiegal. I’m trying to take sensible precautions and not give in to the panic buying. The thought of returning to Barbados in a few weeks is what’s keeping me smiling amongst all this doom and gloom but alas I fear the UK could be in lockdown before I manage to get on my flight!
Bingo Westiegal.
"The US has just announced an immediate travel ban on most European countries effective immediately for 30 days. I expect the Caribbean to follow suit and close their borders, implementing a total travel ban. I'm pretty sure by week's end, all travel will be suspended all over the world. Most airlines will go bankrupt, and tourism will become a thing of the past. God help us all."

We fly out from Canada on Friday morning but my husband can't join us until Saturday. My fingers are crossed that we all make it there together. We only have one case here (discovered today) and none in Barbados. I'm ready to rest on the beach..... hoping we can get home.
"You should be OK, I believe the CARICOM islands are having a conference call this Friday, and I expect them to announce an immediate and widespread travel ban. The people of Grenada are outraged that the government hasn't closed the borders by now."

Am l right in reading the report there is no water in certain parts of the island? How can people wash their hands more often than usual never mind the obvious reasons for needing water? Are tourists being made aware of this before they travel?
What there doing? Asking questions and checking for fever?

Doom and gloom will not get us anywhere ...and I feel we do need to retain some perspective Still more people dying each day due to the 'standard'flu ( even with some vaccine protection) than this particular variety I am with Westie - que sera sera
"You WILL get here Bluespacesky, think positive and go and buy a new bikini ;-))"
"I'm glad you mentioned the ""normal "" flue Mdp . That kills thousands every year especially when they get the vaccine wrong for that particular year's strain, but it doesn't cause out and out panic , it's a fact of life."

"If we are going to accurately compare common flu and covid-19 I think we need to refer to some studies already done. The mortality rate of common flu is 0.1%. The mortlality rate of covid-19 is 3.4%... WHOSo more people infected with covid die as compared to those infected with the ""flu"".Transmission of covid is much easier than common flu. ""The attack rate or transmissibility (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced R-nought or r-zero), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus.WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5. [13]Other studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58. [23].Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between 1.5 and 3.5. [5][6][7]An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear.For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0.""Worldometer-numerous sources."
Ireland have just announced more drastic restrictions ... may prompt the UK to follow suit One or two commentators beginning to criticise the UK Government's management of certain aspects of this situationFor example ... Arsenal match cancelled but last night 3000+ Athletico Madrid fans attended the Liverpool game ...when games in Spain are being played behind closed doors and the whole of the Real Madrid club have gone into isolationWas this in any way sensible ???Government also being criticised for not providing more separated isolation facilities rather than over whelming the hospital wards ..as as happened in Italy where they had a lot less utilisation of their chronic / intensive care beds. The UK is already at 80% + due to staff shortagesGenerally questions being asked about the present slowly slowly approach and whether we are actually as well prepare as we might be for the rapid escalation that looks more likelyMore and more people going public on how they returned to the UK from various countries ( including Italy) without any checks being made by Border Control staffWould appear that the drastic cuts to our government services over the past 10 years are coming home to roost Also growing criticism of the amount of testing being done to confirm infection - which may be leading to under reporting
"Of course more people are dying NC , but surely that is because this is a new strain and an appropriate vaccine has not yet been found. Whereas a huge amount of people have an annual vaccination against the known flu so more people survive ?"
"Yes Westie and that is why the spread of this is so serious. To date we have no vaccine, no resistance and no drugs to effectively fight the virus. They don't even know how weather may affect it, if we are immune after infection and if so for how long or if the infection is bi-phasic. It is because it is all new and people are dying that the disease and its spread is so serious. In a year or two if we are lucky it will just be another lethal viral infection we have to live with.If you got a flu vaccine and they got it right you wouldn't get the flu so you would not be part of the equation to determine the mortality rate of the flu. Without the vaccine more people would get the flu, more would die but the mortality rate would stay essenyially the same (according to the studies done)."
"It's not just about deaths, it's also about the number of serious cases that require medical assistance. If we have too many cases all at once it overwhelms the health services and then more people die from lack of care. Look at Italy if you want a good example of this virus running largely unchecked (or checked too late rather). They have had to institute a triage system similar to wartime where they have to decide who to save! Some other countries went on lockdown very quickly and have managed to slow down the spread significantly so that their health system can cope.We cannot let this virus run through Barbados unchecked - there is no way our health system could cope. Remember it's not just treatment of COVID-19 that would be compromised by an overloaded system, but treatment of everything - heart attacks, strokes, injuries, surgeries, diabetes support etc.And lastly, young healthy people will mostly get through this fine, but how many older or unhealthy people will they kill while they are going about their business as usual? I just don't see how we can expect ""business as usual"" for a virus that puts that many people in a position of needing medical care all at once when health systems are not used to dealing with these numbers. And we are at the tip of the iceberg - it is very, very early days for most of the countries affected. I am really dreading the ""peak"", and will support whatever is necessary to lower that peak so that we can cope!This is not doom and gloom - this is potential reality."
"Thanks for the explanation N C . I had the Flu vaccine one year and shortly after, fainted at our Supermarket check out. Never had it again. lol Bajanswife------------they said on the radio that the outbreak in China was over the peak and on it's way down , so that is encouraging .Edited: 9:20 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Sadly I made the decision to postpone my trip April 5-12th. Fortunately my airline and accommodations are crediting me for future travel. For me, it was a solo trip, I just cant worry my family, and be stuck, sick or quarantined so far from home, or just not be able to get back home-too many responsibilities.  Lets just hope this all resolves swiftly, we all stay healthy. We all love our ""normal"". and things are not and it looks like, for us in the US it will probably get worse before better."
"Westie, having had Asian Flu in the 1950s and been very sick - I have since learned to have the annual flu shots and have never had a bad result - (I've never heard of anyone fainting from a flu shot before ?)"
"Well said Bajan.To be honest I doubt most of the reporting. China says number of new cases is down. I hope so but remember they slso tried to cover it up. Mexico says only 2 cases.... that I can not believe. It's like the Zika outbreak some countries deliberately misreported, some countries didn't test."
"I am also considering the fact that, as a visitor to another country, I am potentially putting them in the position where they would have to take care of me should I get sick. Keep that medical care, that bed for a citizen of their country who might need it. Those beds could end up being scarce."
"Luckily we know a lot more about this virus than China did when it first showed up there - they were unprepared for its spread during the first month for sure. We can all learn from that and hopefully have better results, but only if the governments take appropriate steps and the people cooperate.Also be careful putting too much stock in the current mortality rate. That won't be final until the wave is over and we can see the final death toll. There are currently far too many people still sick in hospitals with the disease and we don't know yet how many of them will live or die. On the flip side of course, we have no idea how many people have actually contracted it because it can be so mild. Kind of like Zika."
"Letsgo, well said! I have been thinking for a few days... ""Am I being irresponsible putting my vacation plans ahead of the safety of others potentially?""If I were a Bajan, I may not be so keen on planeloads of people from affected countries descending on my island! I still have my vacation booked and am set to arrive on the 29th, but I don't know....The experts say travel bans are not effective but this makes no sense to me....why wouldnt they be helpful?"
"It is very worrying. Part of me says live for today carry on as normal, take sensible precautions, but make future travel plans. Another part of me says hold fire on future travel plans it’s too much of a risk at this time. We have just secured flights and accommodation for our February 2021 trip, not yet confirmed, or paid deposit so do we sit tight until we are over the worst and risk losing the accommodation or go ahead. Difficult decisions! Interested to know what other forum contributors who normally plan and book well ahead are doing?"
"From an economic standpoint we really need you guys to come, but from a health perspective .......It's a fine balance. Our PM is putting measures in place to bolster the economy because she knows how badly it is already being affected by this (and it will only get worse)."

Booked for April 23-30 and I plan on traveling. Only a ban will keep me away.One can not live in fear.
Im really worried we are travelling with two small children i do t want to have the virus and not know and be quarantined when we arrive in 6 weeks as I worry if my children will be allowed to be quarantined with me virgin have said that they will change dates on their website im unsure if or bot to do so
"Natasha, I would think that your children would have to be quarantined with you because of their exposure to you, and because they cannot be left without a guardian. The bigger issue is what if you need to be hospitalized - who will look after them?"
"natasha, difficult decision when kids are involved, if you should contract the virus will your family be split up? That's not a good thought to have in your head prior to and during your vacation.

"A very difficult decision if you are travelling with children, I'd be inclined to err on the cautious side.We are due to fly on April 15 staying in Holetown for 6 weeks and have been looking forward to being back in Barbados again. Currently watching the travel advice and holding our breath. Even if we did want to cancel, and we don't, we would lose our money. Obviously if either government bans flights from the UK it will be out of our hands, we'd be absolutely gutted, but at least we won't be out of pocket. Sincerely hope it doesn't come to that."

A woman in Ontario tested positive today after returning from a Celebrity Cruise where one of the stops was Barbados. I hope health officials in Barbados are aware of this. https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/ontario-rep…
Yep his wife went to the UK and now feels sick so whole family in isolation now. Two of our provinces are advising against international travel. Not sure what is happening to the border with the US and that we may have to adopt same restrictions that Trump announced last night. Things are changing fast.
"Gotta say, I'm worried. We're still coming. Three teens and I leave at 5:20am tomorrow. Hubby leaves Toronto at 8:30 Sat morning to meet us. All schools in Ontario were just cancelled until April. I've stocked up on extra meds, etc. Just hope I'm making the right decision."
@casperjj we still plan on going as well-all six of us with two 21 year olds and two seventeen year olds. We leave Saturday at 5:30am. I’m worried too. Hoping we are making the right decision. Safe travels. I hope you have a wonderful vacation.
Most of the later posts have not mentioned if Barbados has any confirmed cases of Covid 19. Does anyone know if they have any ???? Ten of us are set to arrive on the 21st....still planning on going.
Barbados has no confirmed cases of Covid 19. Bet there are cases where you are coming from Dan F? So in effect you are more of a danger to Barbados than it is to you!
Thanks for the update. My concern is not the danger it poses to my party or myself but the fear ofBarbados banning travel into their country. Obviously if any of our group was sick ( with the virus ) they would not be travelling.
Dan last we heard they will be taking your temperature at the entrance to the immugration hall. Expect a slight delay.
NC - interesting set of numbers in Post#250 but in the end this outbreak is still nowhere near the numbers of the two most recent pandemics and at present it is unlikely to do so - according to those 'experts' that disagree on how it should be handledThe Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 - which I do remember killed around 1 million people with a low mortality rate. Around half of those were in Hong Kong itselfThe previous 1956/58 Asian Flu outbreak killed around 2 million people - with over 50000 of these in the USDespite the huge numbers killed it is not really worth comparing the Spanish Flu outbreak as there were so many 'special circumstances' affecting that event and we learned a huge amount on how to restrict transmissionThe UK seems to be becoming more and more isolated ( certainly in Europe) on how to react and we now have a growing questioning and criticism of the Government's approach.They certainly seem to recognise that 10 years of austerity has left the NHS unable to cope with a big peak in cases and are looking to spread the outbreak over a longer period of timeBiggest issue seems to be a lack of physical isolation facilities to cope with big numbers.If China can build a new isolation hospital in 3 days - should the UK not be considering something similar Good to see that China is now offering to help ItalyInteresting times ...especially in the US !!! Also a number of influential 'experts' saying we need a certain level of infection to develop what they are calling a 'herd immunity'
Meant to put in this link https:/…685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cdHow come India is so low !!??
"Mdp I posted those figures because of the comparisons of covid with ""regular flu"" being made not of covid with other pandemics. Of course we now have better testing and public health procedures as well as supportive therapies than we had for previous pandemics, so covid should not be as lethal. Having said that, using the results we have, covid is more lethal than regular flu and in turn needs to be handled seriously.For those interested, our PM's wife, after travelling to the UK, has now tested positive for covid and is in isolation along with the PM and family. Shutting down the House of Commons is being considered. We have three provincial governments and the federal government advising against international travel and for those out of country to self isolate for 14 days upon return to Canada. I stated in an earlier post that I am skeptical about some of the information being released by some governments. The following is one of the reasons.""The first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 can be traced back to 17 November, according to media reports on unpublished Chinese government data.The report, in the South China Morning Post, said Chinese authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year and who came under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was 17 November – weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus.""-- The Guardian. The Chinese gov't didn't warn the world until towards the end of January.IMO a more accurate statement would be ""Barbados has not reported a positive case for covid-19""."
"I have just heard on the news that Trinidad and Tobaco have cancelled all visits from Cruise Ships until the end of the Season. This amounts to 12 ships. Part of the reason given was that they want to save their Testing Kits for people on the Islands and not use them up on Cruise Passengers. I do feel that Barbados would be wise to do the same. Whenever I now see a Cruise Ship approaching , I hope they are not going to be let it in, which is probably irrational when Planes fly in every day, but to me, Cruise Ships have always been floating incubators for some sort of sickness. JMO.Edited: 7:31 am, March 13, 2020 "

"It is a dilemma Westie. My wife and I are not regular cruisers but are booked to leave from Bridgetown tomorrow on Royal Clipper which is based in Barbados for the season. Maximum passenger load 227, less than the vast majority of flights arriving every day. We will take our chance and hopefully the ports will allow us to dock."
"Good luck Damasust, I wish you a safe , happy and healthy cruise . Have a great time.  I believe another friend of mine is supposed to be joining a similar cruise in the near future."
"Damasust are you prepared to self isolate upon your return to Barbados and the UK? That seems to be a requirement countries are now putting into place. Not sure if the UK has implemented that but if not my guess is it will within days. As for Barbados.... who knows. Caricom nations are holding a meeting today so new information should be forthcoming.Enjoy your cruise Damasust.Edited: 8:06 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Barbados has not reported any cases yet, but I would not be at all surprised if there were cases already incubating here. In order to have a positive test there has to be someone ill who is suspected by medical authorities of having it. A person with a mild case who does not seek treatment will not get tested. We should all act as though it is already circulating and take the necessary precautions. Just my opinion."
Totally agree with you Bajanswife.
"I agree totally Bajan. It's not like every person with cold symptoms is going to run to the doctor for testing. I seriously doubt if all offices have the test kits and if the doctors would even test. Look at the numbers coming out of India. Does anyone really consider them to be accurate? Just like chickengunya, zika, dengue... the viruses are here and no logical reason to think they are not. At least with two of them we develop an immunity after infection, with covid they don't know yet."
Cant see that as an option ( self isolating) in UK. They are not enforcing that on people coming from Italy.
NC re: #297 - countries require self isolating after being out of the country? --- Is this a Requirement - as I have urgent ophthalmologist appt soon after my return to Canada?
"long term good news: First step made in Beginning to find a vaccine...  Canadian researchers isolate the COVID-19 virus.A team of researchers from Sunnybrook, McMaster University and the University of Toronto has isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“While the immediate response is crucial, longer-term solutions come from essential research into this novel virus,” Dr. Samira Mubareka, microbiologist and infectious diseases physician at Sunnybrook, said in a statement."
"ASO, BC, Alberta, QC and the feds have asked that people coming into the country self isolate. It is not law yet. Ontario has not asked returning Canadians to isolate themselves unless you have symptoms. We'll see what happens during March break. CBC said 80% of the cases are from being brought into the country.Damasust how is the UK slowing down the spread if not self isolating? Do they wait for symptoms and then positive test results?"

"Hamiltontraveller, I hope to be able to see you soon , but only you can decide what to do unless your flights are suspended. Nearly all our guests are Canadian at the moment , and they are all having a wonderful time."
"Westie our federal and some provincial governments (more to follow I'm sure) are asking your Canadian guests to self quarantine when they return home to try to slow down the infection rate. Hope they are following Canadian news.Glad they are having great holidays. That means they are not infected so they didn't bring the virus into Barbados as far as we know.The last thing I would do is go on a cruise. Many health agencies are advising against it, some countries deny docking and cruise lines are self closing partly because of economics and I would assume to slow down the spread of the virus. Because of their design they are floating petri dishes. Too many people in a confined space."
"Canby----------I was ""speaking"" to Hamilton Traveller , not anyone else."
"NC You too are still enjoying your holiday here , but I do agree about cruising-------------------it's the last thing I would do."
Yes Westie we are still here but after watching the latest news we are wondering if we should be going home early. Our PM has said that if we can not leave (for whatever reason) the Canadian gov't may not be able to help. The gov't has now advised against international travel so AFAIK trip cancellation insurance should kick in. I don't know what that advisory does to Travel medical insurance for people leaving the country as of today but they should check with their insurer.Unfortunately anyone I have talked to has said the Barbados government has not issued any recent advice to its citizens or guests. The only thing I can find online is from January.
"Westie, 2 cruise ships scheduled today and both docked. Not to say passengers were allowed to disembark."
NC I have spoken to a couple from Maine . The both work at a Medical Centre and have been told by their associates that they are in one of the safest places they could be . Unfortunately . they fly home tomorrow but they said they would be happier staying here . They were also impressed by the measures the Island was taking so far .
Did they say why Barbados is theSafest place? I know it is safer than the US considering what has gone on there. Has Mia delivered a speech today bringing people up to date like the PM of Grenada? Caricom had their meeting today.
"Damascus’ I watched one of the ships leave an hour and a half later and was told the other one did too , but I cannot confirm that"

Obviously denied access to StVincent and on its present bearing wont make St Lucia either!Edited: 5:46 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Oh ok Damasust , thanks for that. We certainly had no Cruise Passengers up our way today, but at the moment, that's no bad thing."
"Fascination has cabins that board in Barbados.. sold in Barbados as well as in the UK and other places.(infact any one can book those cabins online..) The would have had to have let people off here before doing their last day at sea before finishing in San Juan on Sunday. one assume that they would have been , at the very least, tested for a fever before disembarkation."
So many islands are banning cruise ships its only a matter of time before all the cruise ships in the Caribbean stop sailing.
We arrived today. With everything going on at home (Ottawa) I actually feel safer here. Temp was taken of everyone before they were permitted in the terminal. Our flight had many empty seats. My husband arrives from Toronto tomorrow. He’s been there for work for two weeks so I hope he makes it. We just ordered out from Zacchios. Their chicken curry is so gooood!
"Good for you Casper , have a great holiday and yes the chicken curry at Zaccios is Yummy."
"Zaccios is wonderful about delivering dinners - with that option and take out from the local restaurants etc, Not a great hardship spending time here casperjj - and I too feel safer here at present, than I do in York Region"
"Glad you feel safe, here in Canada, there is a recommended no travel as of today, safe travels back to quarantine"
"We have been here in Barbados for a month. We leave Sadly on Monday and I'm not concerned about my health leaving here, but arriving in Toronto will be a different story. We must not only traverse the airport but must stay in a hotel over night. Thank goodness I have lysol wipes and my own stock of hand sanitizer. While I feel that we have been in the best possible place -- heading home we will definitely limit our contact with others until we're certain we didn't pick up anything in Toronto. We've been very comfortable on the island and have confidence that Barbados is handling the situation very responsibly."
Hope you quarantine Ma03
Cottagehappy - so according to you doesn;t matter if I went home tomorrow or May - I'll still be facing quarantine?
The government sAys quarantine if you’ve been out of the country
"Aso..,No one can say what might happen in May, things are changing daily , but for right now, this was part of the statement released by the Gov. of Canada today.

Hi we are due to fly from the UK on Wednesday for a 10 day stay with our 6 month old?What’s the feeling over there? Is there a possibility that Barbados will close it’s borders ?
"""""""Is there a possibility that Barbados will close it’s borders ?""""""In these uncertain times .... who knows .... BUT ... it would be a economic disaster for Barbados to turn away visitors who want to travel ...more likely ,IMHO, that they may impose more stringent monitoring ...even though it may allow in someone who is infected but not showing symptoms"
"Also consider what you may have to go through when returning home. Canada has voluntary self isolation right now but that can change at any time, especially if Barbados starts reporting positive cases. Oddly enough many other islands (St. Martin, St, Barth's, Antigua, Martinique, St. Lucia, Cayman's, Guadeloupe, Aruba, Cuba, Curacao, UVI, T&T DR etc) have reported cases but not Barbados....https:/…countries"
"Hi NC, To add to the list, Trinidad and Tobago has its first case also.Barbados is corona virus free or so they claim???Perhaps Westie is doing a King Canute and keeping it at bay!!!"
I must admit that we too are worried about the possibility of Barbados closing its borders.Because of the economic implications it is a very difficult decision for Barbados to have to make.We are here now - supposedly until the end of March - thinking all the time that we may be obliged to scramble for flights and leave suddenly.Very grateful for the information provided on this forum.
We are scheduled to travel this Monday for 2 weeks. How is the situation in Barbados presently? Do things seem normal?
Not as far as we are concerned but you will have to read all the Coronavirus threads and make your own mind up from the information provided on this forum.
"Went to the Massy early - various grocery items out of stock such as NZ cheddar, and inc. all Sanitizers ....other than that -- ???? - all I can report Jennifer"

Thank-you! Greatly appreciate the information. So far we are leaving unless things change. Have a great day!

Just who are these people who are posting Bimfan ?"
"Its such an awful predicament for anyone who has travel arrangements at the moment. We have already had to defer a trip to Palma in Mallorca for the third time, once because of hubby having major surgery then a death of a close family member and now because hubby is still classed as being in the high risk category. In addition to that the whole of Spain has gone into lockdown.We have our much loved annual trip to Barbados booked for August this year however had it been closer we would be thinking about not only the risk to his health but also the risk of bringing the virus onto the island and the impact it will have there. There is no worry for us about getting supplies as its crazy over here at the moment and I know for sure where I would rather be!Hoping the UK government step up and give loud and clear guidance as to what travellers should do as far as travelling abroad.We have two sets of friends who took the risk of travelling to Europe this weekend, one couple have had 12 hours skiing and have now had to make their way home while the other couple have had to hire a car to drive from mainland Spain to France ready to fly home tomorrow.Really hoping things will calm down over the following few weeks for everyone.DonnaEdited: 7:04 pm, March 14, 2020 "
The Canadian Gov't this afternoon is urging all Canadians abroad to come home before they are unable to. Perhaps alluding the closure of borders as the US is starting to do. They announced the addition of UK and Ireland to the ban starting Monday evening.
We should be going to Spain on 23rd March but that’ll all have to to cancelled. We’re also booked for Tampa in May and I think that’ll be a no-go area now too. Fingers crossed we can make it to BIM at the end of October.There is a need to get a grip on this so it must be for the good of all. I’m not looking forward to negotiating with the various companies to get some of our money back though.
"Westigal - You can say what you want, but the realty of the situation is this. The Canadian government has advised all Canadians NOT to travel internationally, and those who are out of the country should return to Canada promptly. In the next few days, Ottawa will announce the names of the very few airports that will accept international flights.So, in closing, this is a very, very serious situation."
I agree wholeheartedly Mel 2007... Time for everyone to go home.Westiegal.... Obviously you seem to be living in a bubble and not understanding the global severity of this pandemic.
"Hardly fair to pick on Westiegal, she is only reporting her experience ND her feelings. It is not all about Canada and Canadian travellers, although they do make up many visitors to Barbados. Some, like Canby, have made the decision that is right for them but it is not the same for everyone. I will, most likely, delay my May trip for a variety of reasons but that may not be the correct thing for others to do."
I suspect every country in the world will be closing its borders it's only a matter of time. While this is likely the nail in Barbados's economy we really have no control over this.
"The ONLY correct thing to do is listen to and follow the advice of the Canadian government. The decision to issue a travel advisory was not taken lightly, believe me, as it will have serious impacts on all travel related industries.I think we need to close this topic now, nothing more to add.Edited: 10:11 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Yes. And it is too bad that villa owners don’t understand the seriousness of this travel advisory and are refusing to rebook or refund because there is no specific “ travel ban” to Barbados.

We shall see....I feel very sorry for the people of Barbados and what this is doing to their economy."
"Friends of ours who own a villa have just received a same day cancellation. They willingly and quite understandingly have said the travellers can carry their credit forward for a future trip. The right think to do in the circumstances. They have another long booking coming up in just ten days time and are expecting to have to do the same thing.However, the dilemma is staff. They will not be able to continue paying their full time staff members if no income is coming in. This is clearly going to affect a lot of jobs in the tourism industry. Tough times ahead for everyone I'm afraid. We too will probably have to cancel our trip next month, but my main concern now is our health and that of our family. Hopefully we will be able to take our holiday in the future, but certainly can't if we become 'permanently incapacitated'!!"

Still can't believe this is all happening.One good thing though, Isis are advising their terrorists not to visit Europe, 'the land of the epidemic'!!"
"Huskertraveller. There are no restrictions in Barbados at the moment.No hand shaking, just fist pumping."
"Good programme ""The People's Business"" on CBC tonight (still ongoing).The CEO Dept. Of Health and Wellness has said that Barbados will not close its borders."
On the news right now the US is contemplating a total country wide shut down of 2 weeks. Would be devestating to Canada and Mexico who are part of the supply chain for US manufacturing. Perils of integrated economies.
"This is what is happening in Aruba...""Government of Aruba has announced that Aruba will institute a lockdown for all incoming international passengers (non-residents), Starting Midnight March 16th. until March 31st."""
"St.Martin and Aruba are Dutch territories. Apart from their geographical locations, their bans have little to do with decision-making in Barbados."
Due to fly this Wednesday (fingers crossed!)What screening are they doing at the airport ? Just checking temperature ?
"Asya we know those are Dutch islands (or should know). I posted those quotes so readers knew what other islands are doing to protect their citizens. Each island has covid as do most of the islands, yet as we are told, Barbados does not. It is as close as St. Lucia and St. Vincent and with planes bringing people from the UK, US and Canada, how long do you think it will be before it is here?"
That and asking if you have been to China (AFAIK).
"Agreed, it has spread throughout the entire world including many,if not all nearby Caribbean Islands.Probably,already in Barbados given huge tourists numbers arriving daily from affected areas like the UK, and not yet detected.Only a matter of time,one fears, before cases emerge."
"We’re travelling for a holiday on Wednesday from London and trying to decide what to do... any updates from people That have just flown in , or flying Monday/Tuesday would be helpful... how full empty were the flights!?"
With all the information now available to everyone I think it would be madness to travel anywhere on holiday at the moment.
No - we have come to the same conclusion! Things are changing at such a pace...

"Westie,speaking to you from Canada-it is likely present everywhere in the world,the globe is wide open to anyone from anywhere.Because this virus can be communicated from someone with no symptoms,it’s quite different from almost anything else we’ve seen,at least in modern history.Officials here say the city of Ottawa,which currently has 10 CONFIRMED cases,likely has 100’s or 1,000’s of cases that are currently undetected,due to no or very mild symptoms.But they are carriers,possibly infecting at a rate of 2.8X each!https:/…I am no doctor,not an expert-just someone who reads and listens to them,the experts & specialists,not social media,the Internet or forums.So unfortunately our beautiful little island with it’s wonderful people likely has,at the bare minimum,a few cases of Covid-19 as we speak,they just don’t know it yet..The link below updates the number of cases by country daily, very informative & detailed.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Stay safe,travel safe,wash your hands at every opportunity & if you don’t need to go out,don’t!"
"No-one can know this for sure, but it just makes sense that the virus is already incubating here. Only when they find the first positive case and trace it back will they know how long it was likely here prior to detection. And if by some chance it isn't here yet, it's only a matter of time. Might as well be preparing from now so that when it shows up we can limit the spread."
We are here now and I was reassured by the Chief Medical Officer's statement on CBC last night that Barbados won't close its borders.We are due to go home at the end of March.It feels much safer here than in the UK at the moment.
Yes I have read that the virus can be passed on before symptoms occur. So why screen only those with symptoms?? Why do they want us to self quarantine for 14 days even if we have no symptoms? If you think... it's because we can pass it on before symptoms. So the procedures at BGI (and many others) could be missing a lot of infected people. I can not explain why Barbados is not reporting any positive tests. Almost all the other smaller islands with less visitors and same screening procedures at ports of entry are reporting positive cases. With the number of people coming through BGI and was coming through the port any rational person (IMO) would assume undetected cases are on the island as hard as that is to accept. We all know the Barbados economy is very fragile and hope covid -19does not destroy what Mia has managed to do to get things back on track.
"Holiday I would be more worried about getting a flight back home rather than countries closing borders.. Virgin has asked your gov't for 7+ BILLION to keep it flying. Airlines are laying off staff reducing flights and cancelling routes, even domestic routes. Some are flying almost empty. Is Virgin and BA immune to what is affecting the other airlines? If they are please share how they manage to do that."
"Posted in another thread...""Just heard on Sky news that BA is dropping 75% of all it's flights."" Sorry no reference.I guess BA is not immune."
"BA is not immune,neither is Barbados."
"Tried to phone the Can. High Commission this morning - started at 8.15am... still trying at 9.30 - message keeps repeating about "" transferring to an attendant - transfer failed - leave message (no time to before message recommences)...Useless - !!!"
"@Westiegal3As I say, ""I think"", not ""I know"". I do not have any proof. It is just a matter of statistical probability. If it is everywhere in the world and B's receives so many tourists, it is highly unlikely it is still not here."

Youtube Sky News BA reducing flights 75% for reference for BA reduction.
"Sky News is reasonably reliable and I find this story quite credible. I have also read that Virgin Atlantic is to ask staff to take an eight week period of absence without pay, there was no mention of how many staff however, I will look up the article."
"It could be there are already cases on the island - surely with the amount of visitors from UK,US and Canada it is inevitable. Taking temperatures at the airport can only detect those showing symptons, but don't forget it can take 7 - 14 days for symptons to present themselves.Here in the UK the official numbers are approaching 1500 (and will probably be more today), but the government said last week that at least 5,000 to 10,000 are actually infected. Who knows how many by now? I think if I were in Barbados now, I would be thinking about getting home before our borders are closed, and flights are cancelled. We are cancelling our trip out there for end of next month. Very sad and worrying situation worldwide."
More about Virgin Atlantic herehttps://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
I wonder if Virgin Atlantic has asked the US government for 7 billion pounds too? After all 49% of the firm is owned by Delta..
"Trinidad and Tobago apparently has recorded it's first four cases of the virus and to protect their population,have cancelled all incoming international flights for a 14 day period while they monitor events.Barbados is quite unusual to be one of the only places on the planet to have recorded not one case ???"
"There are other Caribbean countries who have not recorded a case, Dominica and St. Kitts for example."
"Made a massive decision today not to fly this Sunday to Barbados. I have two parents aged 94 and 86 in Barbados. Both have had ill health. I'm gutted that I'm not going as I was looking forward to seeing them, but I cant take the risk of then catching the Coronavirus. I contacted TUI and they have allowed me to put the date back till November. They have charged me £90. Feeling bad about not going but I have got to think about my parents and not me.Edited: 6:08 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Well that has made our decision easy. We were undecided whether to fly to Barbados on Friday when the PM stated that there should be no non essential travels. If we had gone I think we would have been worrying about getting home whilst we were there. If most of the travel operators are reducing staff and flights there could be people stranded. Not a good way to spend a holiday. Perhaps next year?!!
I realised there are still lots of tourist on island are these people deciding to just stay? What happens to them if there are no more flights out?
The Prime Minister of Canada has advised all Canadians to return home immediately.
"I’m glad we cancelled our trip on Thursday evening. We would have been worried throughout the trip and not truly enjoyed it with the constant worrying. Although we were really excited to come back to Barbados and being our friends we will reschedule. Our host was understanding as well, which was truly appreciated."
"We are here in Barbados till 23rd March. Virgin Atlantic are saying do not contact them if your flight is not within 72 hours of departure. I’ve just checked online and, at the moment, our flight is still scheduled as normal. We will continue to enjoy the rest of our holiday."
"@alexjbim246No, they are not coming back. I have Italian, Canadian and British friends staying in my village. Italians have a flight to London and the to Italy. The flight from London to Italy is cancelled, so they do not yet know what to do. Get stranded in London is no better than remain in Barbados. Canadian and British friends are staying here unless the situation is resolved in their countries. They believe they are safer here. Better climate, lower population density, no confirmed cases, exposure to the infection risk while traveling back home. The lady from Britain prefers self-isolation here than in the UK. BTW, today at Carlton's supermarket not only there was a discount on toilet paper, but you also get a free paper towel roll with it."
Extremely comfortable in Barbados at moment and chilled about the flight home to Gatwick Saturday.I only hope that the thousands of people on cruise shops who have been allowed to be repatriated via Barbados when every other Caribbean Island turned their back on them remember this fantastic gesture and return to the island on holiday when the good times return.
"Hi I think you have made the right decision. Are you flying with TUI, if so will they give you a full refund for your holiday"
"Yes, we have met Brits here who have extended their stay. Don't know how they will be able to extend their travel insurance though."
"I rang about midnight last night to re-schedule our flights with Virgin for Friday. You can only get through if you're going within 72 hours. The recorded message said there would be up to 3 hours wait but i was lucky it was only one and a half (perhaps because of the time). A very pleasant man sorted out a credit for us to use up until the end of December, Just hoping the people with the condo we have paid for will be as obliging as its not our fault we have been told not to travel unless essential,"

"Gutted, was due to come to Barbados for the first time in April, with 2 kids we have been keeping a close eye and worrying if its a good idea.Now the advice from the UK Gov seems to be not to travel anywhere I will have to see if Virgin will give us a refund.Lets hope the world returns to normal soon and the Barbados tourist industry recovers so we can look to rebook next year when things calm down!"
I feel your pain Richard. We were due to fly in April with two kids (although not for the first time). So sad to have to cancel but what can you do.
The 2 cases are from USA.
Richard VA have full details on their web site of how your flight can be moved to a date up to the end of April next year
"Inevitable. Took a while.. Though I suspect there has been previously/currently undetected multiple cases. It will blow up- no chance it wont. Whoever is there now...stay home, away from others. Even if your government isn't telling you yet (maybe they are) -do it any how and do it now. Wash hands, clean surfaces consistently. This virsus is EXTREMELY contagious. We will be fine, you will be fine if you take precautions.I would be interested in where in the US the came from. And where they were on the island. I was supposed to be there April 5-12. Rebooked 6/6-13. Expecting to rebook that too. I will keep pushing it out as long as I have no change fees.Edited: 1:48 pm, March 17, 2020 "
It that case it must be now called the 'Trump Virus' ....but it is very sad that the island has eventually succumbed
"One new confirmed case in Kingston Ontario has just returned from Barbados.Edited: 2:39 pm, March 17, 2020 "

"Not called for mdp 963Edited: 3:00 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"The infected individuals are two women, 44 and 62, as well as one male, 48. All of them were infected while travelling outside the country to countries such as Spain, Barbados and the United Kingdom.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/no…"
"why would it be the Trump Virus, MDP.. maybe the first Brit that gets it and is here, will call it Boris's Virus?? Totally uncalled for.. Anyway.. found the CBC.CA article, re the person in Kingston. the person may have been in Barbados.. but they would need to track the movements to prove anything. There is'not direct flight between Barbados and Kingston.. so.. could have been out of Toronto, or any other location they may have been."
"We just returned from Barbados to Gatwick yesterday. We stayed for nearly two weeks. I thought it was only a matter of time to be honest until one in Barbados as temperature checking is not totally effective by all accounts. Have to say that our flight was full of people coughing, one man in particular behind me on the plane was looking very worse for wear. I thought he was going to hack up at one point, poor man, but it made people very very uncomfortable.The hotel we stayed in we love but could have done better on hygiene, we stayed two weeks and many people had winter colds but hand gel only appeared two days before we left - and only at dinner despite 3 x meals a day buffet style. Staff seemed quite worried for their health but guest procedures could have been better. Lots of guests had coughs, splutters and cold and it made it very uncomfortable. We had lots of hand gel etc anyway but are feeling a bit rubbish today- hopeful it’s only jet lag and change in climate but self isolating in case. Glad we left when we did to be honest."
If Boris had called it the 'Chinese Virus' -- then most definitelyIt was meant as a dig at the idiot Trump ... not the unfortunate people who have caught it

"too late to edit PMPThree additional cases in Kingston were announced Tuesday afternoon. Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox and Addington Public Health said three cases of COVID-19 have been identified. None of them have been hospitalized, and they are self-isolating."
mdp963 I got the joke! Racist Trump has taken to calling the Corona Virus ‘the Chinese virus’. He’s a despicable fool who needs to disappear. Clueless to the mood of the nation/the world.
Sunniebgi see below.It's on many Canadian news sites.Not idle speculation.
"I am in Kingston, Ontario..Our medical officer of health has revealed that we have three first cases of Covid in Kingston. One from the UK, one from Spain and one from Barbados.All three developed symptoms before boarding their flight home."
It appears that everywhere has or will get Covid-19 so there really is no point in getting into a blame game. Everyone needs to come together (well metaphorically) to fight it.
No blame game coming here for me. Just thought I would answer some of the questions from previous chats.
and I was just correcting a comment that questioned my accuracy
"I just hope everyone is safe, they are saying you should get Covid-19 so that you can become immune to it. (Can’t remember exactly where I read it). Hopefully if/when we do get it, we all only get it in a mild form."
"Lunasesawanderlust.. I wasn't commenting as if you were speculating.. I was simply asking, originally, for news reports etc. I found it on a CA website."
A lot is not known about the virus. We don know if you can get it more than once. Try NOT to get it. They are working on treatments and a vaccine. Treatments will come before the vaccine-that will be at least a year. For those over 65 and with underlying health issues it can be fatal.
No worries. Here's where I get my info:https://www.ontario.ca/page/20
"This is a global problem. No one is immune. To start name calling will accomplish nothing. After all we are adults. (I assume). Hope all will come together and understand the ""enemy"" is the virus."
"I agree that fighting the virus is the final aim Sherbert T, but the root cause is almost certainly bad management of a menagerie, a food market and essentially bush meat. When we see calls to name and shame villa owners who do a bad job we seem to agree it will encourage better practice in the future. Someone or a small group has shut down the world and killed people. Naming, shaming and prosecuting them is in order. Nothing will bring back the lost souls, but trying to be polite may allow searching out the causes and preventing them happening again to be avoided by the perpetrators of this international scandal. There can be no hiding from this being released not ""just happening"". Barbados, her people and her governent have been hurt by this, despite their beautiful location and attitudes to foreigners. Unlike G9 or G20 countries they will really struggle to recover so from our safe, rich world we ought to offer our immediate help via the Commonwealth and then by using our Court systems for reparations from the originator which at present is alleged to be China. Shutting down bush meat is now a priority as we have seen its powerful ability to kill outside of its locale."
"Flyingjohn, I have to agree with your post, this is not the first time that China has caused this sort of problem. The disgusting trade in wildlife in the ""wet markets"" needs to be banned totally."
And still these markets go on in a lot of Asia. The world needs to make sure this is stopped.
"Just been on there local news website and it states that they have just confirmed there first 2 cases of the virus 22 hours ago (Tuesday 17/03/20)The people are in isolation and hopefully it can be contained.My wife and I are due to fly out there in May, although as of yesterday TUI have said there will be no international flights by them until 16th April, apart from bringing nationals back home. All TUI package holidays have been cancelled until that date at least."
I am due to fly on Friday. Holiday not been cancelled as yet but Im worried that we wont be able to get back home.
Even China realizes it is time to change...https:/…index.html
"Thanks NorthernCanuck1.Interesting article. The value put on this trade by CNN barely covers 20% of what the UK Government alone has spent trying to combat the effects and pales into insignificance compared to the worldwide monetary cost. The real measure, in my opinion, is the premature death of our treasured people and answering for that is not a dollars and cents kind of thing. Decimating economies of small nations reliant on visitors and the ongoing hardship deserves to be answered for. 8000 deaths to date is a drop in the ocean compared to other causes, but this was predictable and China knew it. Mealy mouthed official apologies and pseudo-legislation which may not be enforced is hypocrisy. I would call on the international community to champion real change and pray that our quiet voices would carry to those with power."
Flyingjohn I was talking about Trump comments. And yes you are right the true culprit should be held accountable. Also all who will not do the right thing should be named. Very well said statements on your part. Stay safe.
"Thanks Sherbert T, This online community seems solid in being grown-up and it would be so nice if we could influence more to be. Staying safe should be top of all of our wishes for everyone and, as I think we have all said, we would wish Barbados; her people and her visitors all that they need to get through this and recover."
"@pauline83 hi Pauline, we are also due to fly out tomorrow. Are you still flying?"
"Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Barbados. The Barbadian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. All non-resident British nationals currently in Barbados are strongly encouraged to contact their airline or tour operator, to review options and consider leaving as soon as practicably possible.

Did you get to Barbados? Or is it closed? We’re hoping to go July before heading to grenadines
