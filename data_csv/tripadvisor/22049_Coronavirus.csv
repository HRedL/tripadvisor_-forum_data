"Hi All,Should we concern about Coronavirus in London? Does anyone know the number of infected people there?Thanks!cxhw"
Zero
In the whole of the UK there are currently 3 people who have been confirmed as having the corona virus (1 in London and 2 in Newcastle) and they're all quarantined
"There have been 2 cases in the UK. No deaths as of today. According to the WHO. https:/…As of 3 Jan 2020, there had been 3152 people hospitalized with influenza though. So I'd be more concerned about that.https:/…"
"Extract from news :- The third person in the UK to be diagnosed with coronavirus caught it in Singapore, it is understood"
"cxhw - The way things are going, there will be more cases in the US (perhaps even in NYC) than there are or will be in London.Enjoy your trip."
Why is it currently more of a concern in London than in New York?
"No, no, don’t come - 3 people in 66 million are confirmed with the virus - that’s 22000000:1 (you do understand risk? Considerably more people die in the US of common or garden flu every year than fatalities in the UK from Coronavirus)"
"I don't think you should be any more concerned about coronavirus in London than anywhere else in the world, including New York."
"According to Fox News you should be more concerned about No Go areas, roaming knife gangs stabbing everyone and bubonic plague. Feel free to wear a mask if that helps.As Douglas Adams wrote, DON'T PANIC !!"
I'd say the biggest danger is the airport at your end and the flight where everyone is stuffed in together with recycled air.
">>Considerably more people die in the US of common or garden flu every year than fatalities in the UK from Coronavirus<<Never mind US, considerably more die of the flu in Oshkosh than of Coronavirus in UK."
More people die from diseases related to eating McDonald's than have or probably will die from Coronavirus.
wash your hands and blow in a tissue and dont eat any bats :)
"Also drink plenty of whisky or gin..!Your biggest health concern in London just now is the traffic. Look both ways before crossing the road..!Edited: 4:24 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"'Does anyone know the number of infected people there?' No, and we're not going to know the precise number unless a lot of money and time would be put to the task, which isn't likely to happen.It is a given that X people will have come in contact with nCoV and have had mild respiratory illnesses thereafter. Some of those people will think they had colds, others might have referred to it as flu, but they will have now recovered and not known they contracted nCoV.Unless antibody testing for those X people could be done then determining 'the number of infected people' won't be known as there are not the resources to go through the process.That a percentage of the X who've contracted nCoV will have had comorbidities that will have made them more susceptible to the pneumonia caused by nCoV is also a given, but some of those may not have sought medical attention but instead struggled through and have now recovered or have had an acute on chronic response to another comorbidity and nCoV identification may have gone by the wayside.Basic infection control advice holds: wash your hands frequently."
The whole city has been evacuated. I think I might grab a Nandos and go to the British Museum while it's quiet.
bet i beat you there first I'll be driving the bat mobile :)
"Well, according to some weird post on the Hong Kong forum, some idiotic pseudo scientist with a presumably useless prediction tool appears to be suggesting London will be the place to avoid come June owing to some seriously improbably numbers.I am quoting completely out of contexthere, of course, but his Youtube video is stating that 56 million will infected in the UK by June with 4 million deaths. Cobblers. Utter, utter tosh.I'd say that the greater risk for a first time visitor from the USA is going to be looking the wrong way before crossing a street. SWT"
Well thank goodness I've got leave from the NHS in June phone will be off the hook :)
love this statement from that forum His information is worrying because he doesn't seem to be an alarmist (although he is trying to sell his spreadsheet tool!) Get out the credit card :)
My train to Victoria this evening stopped at Gatwick and as always lots of people boarded. As far as I could see a grand total of two were wearing masks and they got off at East Croydon. I don’t think there’s panic here yet.
Oh good. Might finally get a seat on the Northern Line.

"The coronavirus is low risk. They have suspended flights to China. It is still localised to China. However, there is a risk. Are you someone likely to catch a cold?. What happens if you are sneezing, would they let you on a flight? Would they let you land at Heathrow?Travel can wear down the immune system. So long as you you are fit, healthy and your immune system in top form you would be fine. Have travel insurance."
"I think that if you are worried about spreading the virus then you should stay home.In fact, if everyone stayed at home then this would not spread at all.I for one am not leaving the Dingle peninsula this year."
Wasn't it in america that a large number of Google searches showed that people apparently thought Coronavirus was caught from drinking Corona beer (a Mexican beer) ?
"Ah, but how can you drink beer without taking your mask off? Now we know how it spreads :)"
"You may want to watch ""28 Days Later"" and ""28 Weeks Later"" before making up your mind about traveling to London."
Wasn't it in america that a large number of Google searches showed that people apparently thought Coronavirus was caught from drinking Corona beer 8% of Americans believe they have been abducted by aliens so......
I'm with fuschia2014.People who travel ARE the problem.
"Oh God I have just come back from Thailand with endless endless is it safe to travel to Thailand posts and I come back to the UK and now that have started here, is it safe to travel to London.Why would any think that people on TA England forums would have more up to date data on how many case there were that Google or the news sites."

@33 in June - when the entire population of the uk is forecast to have coronavirus.. Personally I have a mask (well I bought it years ago for diy so I may need a new filter) and a stock of elderberry gummies as they help with flu. So I still expect to be around in July but maybe bored of TA.
Reports yesterday say a Brit who visited Singapore and then went to a ski lodge in France managed to cause a family of five Brits to contract the virus. It has also now caused more deaths than SARS.
Which relates how to the question about London ?
Please take no notice of John S his replies to this posthttps:/…105406446 have caused it to be moved instead of removed to OTC forum we await him with bated breath

Sounds serious. Should I be concerned for my family? Never heard of it.
No your will be OK if you wear a mask for the next 6 months:)
Coming to visit you in June. Wanna hang out?
Not if you are masked :)

yes b concerned. airport is the worst place. over the coming weeks the virus will get worse. take a breather-stay home for nowmarch 6
"TA added a link to a Covid article, on many Destination Forums, at least when viewed via a browser, and full dot com site: https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019Looks pretty comprehensive as for now, but not sure if it will get updates in a timely fashion, and with correct info?Situation is pretty fluid, at this time.Best of luck to all,Hunt"
"Nobody is telling us the thruth folks, your telling me all these scientists dont know what it is and how we catch it,the figures from virus deaths are way out,and people are worried that oil has gone down to nothing?watch and see if petrol and diesel goes down, waste of time we cant go anywhere if we wanted to, this is all a giant hoax and we have fallen for it, by the way david icke was right"
"At a guess there will be a strong temptation to mark post 54 as not travel related or similar, but I think it should be left in place as an example of the right to be wrong.The author isn't likely to return as his tinfoil hat will need adjusting, but there are others who share the skewed views in that post and they need to be acknowledged as such. I see that Two Beards Lebedev's London Live was facing sanctions for showing the interview with barmy Icke but that's been set aside. Better to ask why they'd think 80 minutes of raving fruitcakery would have made for good television, period."
"I'm happy for 54 to stay put myself, as it serves as a great example of some of the utter drivel that has been posted on social media since all this began.At the same time, though, it is highly offensive to all those who have died and their loved ones. And of course, scientists know what it is and how it's transmitted it. That's precisely why we are in lockdown."
