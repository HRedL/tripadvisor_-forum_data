I have a booked and fully paid for trip to Rome on March 15th .. for my birthday. Everyone is telling me to cancel but I will lose a lot of money if I do ( 5* hotel / business class flights ) and am looking forward to it... I don’t know what to do! Airline will not allow me to cancel and will offer me less than half my money back
"Of course, this is a personal choice, but I would go. Rome is not on the list of areas/cities to avoid so I see no reason to not go. Take some precautions, such as washing your hands frequently and using hand sanitizer along with common sense and you should be okay. Donna"
"I am in Rome at present and I can tall that everything is still quite normal. Businesses, public transport, restaurants, schools, are normally working.The focuses are not i Rome, but in some regions of Northern Italy some 500 km apart; and this situation has not changed last week.Unfortunately, it was unavodable that abroad medias came to spread scaremongering and misinformation talking in general terms about ""Italy"", but Italy is large and there are important difference between areas. The airline woulnd'nt give your money back because in Rome there is no real emergency. Please keep calm and don't trust every thing you can read in tabloids.And anyway, wait: from today to the 15th things may change (in better or in worse) and if you really want to cancel and to lose some money, at least do it at last moment. If you cancel today you won't be able to come back."
It’s a personal decision. I’m booked for Thursday and really looking forward to it . As you probably know we’ve had confirmed cases in Brighton and it really wasn’t that noticeable but if you don’t feel comfortable it is your choice
Go just wash your hands a lot .3.000.000 people in Rome with very few cases
"Go through the main thread on this and pay attention to the evident-based content in particular. I definitely wouldn't travel to Rome in your situation. Re the airline, there is a good chance they will cancel - in which case you'll be entitled to a refund. (Links on that other thread). So don't cancel, wait it out.As of a few hours ago, the following airlines have already curtailed travel to Italy. I've taken this for another wider report but focussed on Italy in particular. These and other airlines have also curtailed or cancelled completely to other areas of course, most notably China.So here's the list. No doubt it will be extended as we move forward. * Brussels Airlines - Lufthansa subsidiary said on 28 Feb it would cut flights to northern Italy by 30% from 2 Mar - 14 Mar.* Air Canada to allow travellers to rebook flights to parts of Italy at no charge* British Airways said it would cancel some flights to and from Italy.* EasyJet said on 28 Feb it would cancel flights, particularly in and out of Italy and cut costs across its business.* El Al Israel Airlines said it would suspend flights to Italy, including Milan and Rome from 28 Feb to 14 March,* Kuwait’s civil aviation authority halts all its flights to and from Italy.* Lebanon halted flights for non-residents from Italy.* Tunisia may suspend some flights to Italy.* Wizz Air said it would decrease the frequency of its Italy routes, cutting two-thirds of all flights on affected routes over three weeks between 11 March and 2 April."
"Just use the precautions you would during flu season. Wash your hands a lot, cover your mouth if you cough, use an alcohol based hand sanitizer, don't touch your face. Donna"
"Sorry, #5 should say 'evidence-based'."
Same boat as you except we are set to fly in to Venice. Got quoted over $5000 to change my destination to Rome...
"I would go - just adhere to the hand washing, using tissues, etc advice. the only thing that might, and I mean might, give me pause would be if I were in one of the groups at higher risk. For the vast majority of people coronavirus is little different to getting a dose of flu."
"I would go and take the train directly to Rome upon landing. If you also fly out of Venice be back the night before, perhaps staying in one of the areas away from the airport. Donna"
"So, not same boat. Venice is much closer to the focuses than Rome. As for the division officialized today by the government, Venice is ""yellow zone"" as for emergency level (not red; this one consist just of a dozen of municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto), Rome is neither.Above all, please stop reasoning in terms of ""Italy"". The country is large and there are so many difference inside it. I dont' think you were pleased if Brighton were regarded as Scotland or Northern Ireland, so don't make similar mistakes (by the way, Italy is larger than the UK).N.B. I couldn't read the specific advice by Donna but I find it reasonable.Edited: 8:08 am, March 02, 2020 "
"If you’re crazy, I am too. I’m also leaving for Rome the 15th and will do so unless the airlines cancel my flights."
Just regarding EasyJet: Their website says they are not changing their flights to/from Italy and normal ticket restrictions apply. I’ve been keeping a close eye on it because I’m using them to leave Rome on the 22nd and I also read that they would be canceling.
We're booked the same week and I have no qualms at all. There's as much chance of catching Coronovirus in Rome as there probably is at home (the currently isolated areas are in the North of the country and even there life is going on as normal). The incidence of the disease among kids my son's age is incredibly low. Neither of us parents are near any kind of age where it is dangerous and neither are ill or have a pre-existing condition. Plus Coronovirus is not going to go away any time soon so it makes no sense to put life on hold until it does. I'd honestly be more worried about Roman traffic.P.
The next two weeks are going to be so stressful for all of us. We are due to fly on Lufthansa out of Boston on March 21. We aren't making any decisions about canceling for two more weeks. For many of us on this forum these trips have been planned and researched for months. It is a very emotional time. I know if we have to cancel I truly will be heartbroken.
"#14: ""Coronovirus is not going to go away any time soon so it makes no sense to put life on hold until it does.""Actually, it makes a LOT of sense to put life on hold re travel (domestic and international) at this time, as you'll surely know if you've been following the science on this. And if you don't know that yet, you soon will as official advice is updated in Ireland and elsewhere. Just take a look at today's Irish Times for some updates: https://www.irishtimes.com/Other facts to consider. There have been cases in Rome already. If the small number of cases, or when those cases were discovered, is anyone's idea of proof that Rome shouldn't be considered a risk, I'd draw your attention to the two recent deaths in Washington State (US):That state's first case was more than 4 weeks ago, and in the intervening period they did extremely limited testing (""a few dozen"" tests reported by NYT) on the assumption it was an isolated case. Scientific results now suggest this allowed the virus to spread undetected there and cause the current sudden spike. #11 is at least correct to suggest this is a problem bigger than just Italy. It's here in the UK, the USA and many other countries too. The sooner everyone wakes up to that fact and stops trying to protect their little bit of turf, the sooner we'll get through this. Err on the side of caution and ignore those pretending this is someone else's problem or that's it somewhere else. Definitely treat with extreme caution those who accuse outsiders with an agenda. Follow the facts, the evidence, the science, and official guidance that is based on these things. Finally, we know that travel spreads this disease. Why wouldn't you want to help prevent spreading it to others by curtailing your travel?"
"""There's as much chance of catching Coronovirus in Rome as there probably is at home""""I'd honestly be more worried about Roman traffic.""I think you are right, Paul!"
"""AT LEAST correct""??? ME???Oh my God… so grand and munificent by you. I don't deserve this just to describe unbiasedly what passes day by day in my city and to prevent people by irrational scaremonger."
"#11 - Yeah my apologies for generalizing; I know Venice is a whole different situation than Rome. We are supposed to have 2 nights in Venice, 3 in Florence, and 4 in Rome with our flight home from Rome. We do have a layover in Paris and right now the Delta also wants over $5,000 to change from Paris - Venice to Paris - Florence."
"Thank you Dollburger, you don't need to apologize. It's not for yourself, but that the situation is different area by area is seemingly not widely notorious, and repeating may help."
"Aristofane. Totally agree. As someone in Rome - are trains running as normal from the northern areas? If we took a train from Paris (our layover) we have to change in Milan, which seems worse than just flying in to Venice and immediately taking a train from there. We don't want to get stuck in Venice though if situation worsens. We're in a wait and see mode right now. I have a feeling yes/no decision won't be made for at least another week."
"#19 Crazy price they are asking for. Today's news from the US (new cases in New York & Floida, deaths on West Coast, etc) would suggest a further clampdown on travel. When are you due to travel? I'd wait this one out a bit longer rather than pay any further money? Can you get a full refund rather than change?"
"""Are trains running as normal from the northern areas?""Yes. The only off-limits areas are a dozen of municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto, but no big cities."
"#22 - yeah I was amazed. The restrictions are worded a bit odd, and after sitting on hold for 2 hours with Delta the person I got wasn't able to help much either. Our plan is to wait longer to see what develops. Our flight out is March 17th. From Delta:*When rescheduled travel occurs beyond May 31, 2020, the change fee will be waived. However, a difference in fare may apply. Final travel must be completed by end of ticket validity, one year from date of original issue. If travel is not able to be rescheduled within these guidelines, customers may cancel their reservation and apply any unused value of the ticket toward the purchase of a new ticket for a period of one year from the original ticket issuance. Applicable change fee and fare difference will apply for new travel dates. Final travel must be completed by end of ticket validity."
We are booked to arrive in Rome March 15 as well then go on to Munich on 3/18. Our worry has nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with potential border closings and quarantines upon returning home as very little distinction is being given here to different areas of Italy. I'm all for going. My husband's work is a bit more sensitive so that is our main consideration.
"My brain hurts trying to interpret that Delta message!I guess everything is up in the air atm (excuse the pun), so you are right to wait. I'd be surprised if this isn't taken out of your hands soon anyway. Hopefully Delta get to grips with this and treat customers fairly. Back in the day, I had a 60-day Delta Pass that gave me unlimited standby travel around the USA. As a hangover from those days, Delta is a brand I trust... Good luck with it."
"@24..you said ""We do have a layover in Paris and right now the Delta also wants over $5,000 to change from Paris - Venice to Paris - Florence."" First I think you got a Delta agent not wanting to work with you...plain and simple. If you call again (regular business hours better...early in day not late) you might get different answer. Your travel date is within the scope they are dealing with now and that request is honestly very easy. I would caution that tomorrow Florence could be the new hotspot or Rome...no guarantees on anything if traveling in the next month and then you will have more problems. If you want to take the risk and do that change... try again...it honestly should be the same fare. Also do be prepared that DL as well as other airlines are looking at load factors minute to minute and you may have changes to that return from Rome. Good luck."
#27 Thanks. Yeah I had to laugh when I heard the price for an even shorter flight. I'm going to see how this week progresses and try again near the end of the week. Since we're still a month away from our return flight home from Rome I'm certainly nervous about changes to that flight as well.
"We too have reservations for Rome on the 14th. My concern is not getting the virus, rather it is returning to the USA. Right now we are allowed to enter, but what if just one other person gets the virus near Rome? There is so much hype and fear, I am concerned it will push the government to shut us out, or quarantine us. Yet, in spite of this, we too are waiting it out, hoping that things calm down and we can enjoy all of the beauty that Rome has to offer!"
"Ohhhh, we are now planing a bucket list, first time, trip to Italy and Greece. I would SO SO SO upset! I can empathise.I believe many airlines and travel providers are beginning to offer cancellations.I won't call anyone crazy!!!!! But, I would certainly hope that a traveler doesn't bring this thing into my area here. We don't need that right now.This is traveling around the globe and is now what I would consider pandemic because of all the travel.Edited: 5:29 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"No official agency has called this a pandemic so we shouldn't post that here on a travel forum. If you are not comfortable traveling to Italy because of the warnings then you shouldn't go. If you are comfortable going then you should go and have a wonderful time.DonnaEdited: 6:22 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"I'm schedule to go to Rome on the 11th. We were going to go straight to Sicily. I'm booked on Iberia, though Orbitz, and getting conflicting info about rebooking from them. I've been on hold for so long that awful on hold music might never leave my brain!Like others, I'm less afraid of getting the virus in Italy than I am about what will happen when I return to JFK. Anyway, hard decisions all around."
"I wouldn't take notice of #5 's scaremongering. They seem to do it on every thread and its starting to rub people up the wrong way. Obviously we cannot predict the future but as the Government say its okay to travel, I don't see why you should have to lose out. Go on and enjoy your trip - but keep in mind you have to be more vigilant about infection and consider the possibility of self isolation upon return if the situation changes during your stay."
"As long as you're staying in Rome you'll be fine, I'm currently here and everythings normal, just keep your eyes on the news :)"
"A lot of people are encouraging you to go ahead and go. I have a different perspective and I'm telling you this with the full knowledge that this Coronavirus is really not a big deal in most of Italy. Especially in Rome. My family and I are booked to fly to Rome and spend 2 weeks in country. Unfortunately the State Department has issued a level 3 warning, that will make it much more difficult for travelers to return back to the U.S. Not only that, I am reading about current reports of travelers flying into Rome, but their return flights back to the United States have been canceled due to under booked flights. It's not so much the virus, but it's more the logistics that you have to conciser. I am in the process right now of cancelling my expensive trip on the 13th of March to Rome, Naples, Venice, etc. because of the uncertain logistics involved with coming back home. I have a job back home to conciser and I would hate to lose all that time off work and lose all that money trying to get back in the process. Let alone getting quarantined for 14 days. You decide, but there are so many factors that affect over seas travel to the 3rd most virus infected country in the world.Blame this on the U.S. State Department and the CDC. They are the ones putting on all those restrictions for Americans not the virus. If money and time are not an issue for you, then by all means go for it.Edited: 7:35 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"American travelers are encouraged to visit the CDC website for information and updates. What is true today may not be true tomorrow. No one knows, so this is a question of risk-aversion versus risk-loving.To date, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are more at risk than others.yet no guarantees. This is a personal decision for each of us.."

What is most important is to be a responsible human being during a precarious time.And just so you know, if you are a U.S. citizen, the State Dept. HAS issued travel warnings for Italy...and they are Level 4 (do not travel) to the Veneto and Lombardy regions and Level 3 (no unnecessary travel) to the rest of Italy.

I need to look on the positive side and not worry about what could happen .. Everyone is different. If your not comfortable them I would say do not go but I am 100 percent ready for ROME!!"
#41 exactly. It's not going anywhere and when we return there will be more cases in the US. and amazing memories of Italy.
"#38. Thanks Chester9cat. We agree on the need to be responsible at this time and consider others. But regardless of what personal decisions people make about travel plans, it's looking more and more likely that governments, employers and airlines will make these decisions for many. We've cancelled our Easter trip to Ireland btw, so not suggesting something we haven't done ourselves. BrightonisBeautiful (OP), please do keep us updated on what you do/what happens. If you do end up going - even though I wouldn't - I wish you a happy and healthy trip. :)"
"For those who are going soon, consider that you'll see Rome with only a fraction of the crowds, and no Chinese tour groups. Could be the best trip ever, one that others later will never get to have in Rome.Of course there are legitimate concerns about quarantines and restricted entry on return. No risk, no reward?Edited: 5:03 am, March 03, 2020 "

"KSoze2020,**There are reasons that agencies have not yet referred to this “outbreak” or “epidemic” as an official “pandemic” **They haven't so lets not flame the fires and call it one here. Pandemics affect a large number of people. When you consider the world population against the number of people who have been affected you'll see that the number is really very small. While this virus has spread to multiple countries the number affected isn't huge so it's not considered a pandemic and we shouldn't be calling it one here on a travel forum. People are worried enough without someone ""considering"" it a pandemic simply because a tiny bit of the population has been affected. The number of confirmed cases in Italy, as of yesterday, is 1835. The population of Italy is over 63.3 million. When you add all the tourists into the mix you get well over that number. While this virus is something to be concerned about it is certainly not at pandemic levels. Right now the level in Italy is affecting .00002 percent of the population (not considering the addition of all the tourists which would make that number even smaller). If you compare covid 19 to the H1N1 virus that hit a few years ago you'll see this is not nearly the same. The H1n1 virus killed between 50-100 million people according to the CDC,and was a true pandemic. Donna"
"#38 I disagree. He is scaremongering. The fact that more people die from flu alone a year should make anyone travelling think logically. Factual information does not seem to be their forté. He has done this on numerous threads - calling out people for being UNETHICAL for travelling.And just so you know, as I am not a US citizen I have no care for the CDC. Considering the OP Is from the UK, I suggest they take no heed to what the CDC have to say and follow current FCO guidelines that state it is OKAY to travel."
"NorthWestUK1 - You seem to be trying to dress your opinion up as government advice?...You are talking nonsense.OP - Do NOT cancel. UK Government advice for Rome has not changed - if it changes and they advise against all but essential travel / against all travel you will be covered by insurance. Easyjet, who I'm flying with, are following WHO guidance and they are against imposing travel restrictions. We arrive on the 16th - we have booked Colosseum & Vatican but not booking anything else and are just going to wing it when we get there. Figure less booked activities the better..."
"I am booked to Milan end of May, so I am trying to stay cautiously optimistic.I did not buy trip insurance as my hotel is refundable up until 24 hours , and since I bought the plane tickets with Amex, i am covered.If the airlines are still cancelling flights on May 1- we will just push the trip off till September sometime Good Luck - hope you get to go !"

"We are booked for April 2 through 14th and at this point we are still going. I work in healthcare and all I can say is the contagion rate and infection rate is very much in line with influenza. Unfortunately, when it hit China they were not prepared and did not have the ability to manage the outbreak or level of care needed for the mass amount of people infected. If the rate in Rome and south stays where it is today, it would be the same as cancelling a trip to New York City because there was an outbreak in Atlanta. In the end it will be your opinion that has to matter most. Unfortunately the man upstairs is the only one with the best answer:)."
"Correct.. I am a nurse.. leaving today from US to Rome.. I am well aware of expectations and spoke to my public health office before I left at my place of employment..They said “enjoy your trip” . I do have a few items with me (hand sanitizer, clorox wipes for surfaces, mask for precaution if I need one but won’t be wearing it unless I need to). Washing my hands will be my best defense but I do that all the time anyways.. No one can say they are 100 percent safe so I could not say that either but I am not going to let this stop me from still enjoying life.. If every bug out there prevented me from doing anything.. I would not have a job.. Be safe everyone.. See you others in Rome who are coming :-)"

"Problem is not going there, its returning especially to the US with the restrictions they have in place."
"#57Well there are problems going into a country where resources are stretched, dealing with an epidemic, where life is being regulated to deal with the epidemic and where if you develop symptoms you would be asked at a minimum to place yourself in home detention, without a home.

"I don’t think there’s hysteria per se but there sure is a lot of anxiety about the virus and to travel or not.

You can be carrying the virus without symptoms until later, so “not showing symptoms” doesn’t mean you are okay, although of course it could mean that. Only time will tell.

We have just returned today and had a great time. I suppose it is a personal choice but after a lot of deliberation we decided to go and so far am very glad we did.
My anxiety isn’t about being in Rome. I’m more concerned about being quarantined on my way home.
Good luck rebooking elsewhere. I can’t even cancel one leg of my flight without paying over $500 to do so. It’s nuts.

"Ok yes, I can see that now. I'm just wondering if all people are automatically having their temperature taken or is it only people with symptoms? I guess either way it doesn't matter and this is cause enough to consider cancelling my trip :( :("
Lauren there is also now cdc recommendation for 14 “social distancing” aka quarantine for all travelers returning from Italy. We will unfortunately have to cancel now as my husband can’t miss work and I have teenagers who can’t miss two weeks of school.
"Lauren, a fever is a symptom."
"Thank you Ruth K for link to website of Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (#82).IMFA website reads in part (using Google translate): ""Passengers from coronavirus-prone locations, including Italy, will also undergo health screening at both departure and arrival airports in the USA. During departure checks (thermal check, medical evaluation, questionnaire with travel history), in the event of symptoms or suspicious cases, boarding may be denied. On arrival, isolation will be provided for symptomatic passengers, while for travelers, including Italians, who do not show any symptoms and who have therefore passed all the checks and have entered the country [USA], the Center for Prevention and Disease Control recommends, as a precaution, among other things, a 14-day voluntary home quarantine.""Since it reads ""boarding *may be* denied"" (vs. will be denied) I'm interested in knowing if some symptomatic or suspicious cases will be allowed to board? For example, if the aircraft is not fully booked, thus allowing for more than 6 feet (2 meters) distance (approximately 2 seats in each direction) between the suspect passenger and others. https:/…risk-assessment.html"
reports suggest that at least t JFK people were not asked questions/health check etc. I really hope that changes.
"""I'm interested in knowing if some symptomatic or suspicious cases will be allowed to board?""Clearly they are and therein is the reason for the rapidly increasing numbers in US many traced back to travel to hotspots and other countries.Edited: 9:46 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Not sure if it was covered earlier in the thread, but I saw on a cruise line website and a more general one that if you are scanned for temperature and you are over the 99.5F threshold, you then go through a more involved secondary testing, which seems to include specific coronavirus testing. It implies (but doesn't confirm) that if you pass the secondary testing, you should be approved to board. I think that makes sense as many travelers' baseline tempurature could be 99.5F or higher. Is anyone else seeing this as well and specifically from Italy, where I'm supposed to be visiting in early April?"
"@89 they are not doing ""specific"" corona testing at the airport...those results are taking time and alot of effort apparently to even qualify for the test. They will look for further symptoms, ask questions etc and make a judgment call as to whether you board. They are stopping people. One was stopped while getting ready to board a flight to MSP this week...admitted having contact with a positive person while in Europe and he was showing symptoms...one day earlier maybe no symptoms he would have boarded..he was tested and it came back positive."
"Thanks for the clarification Gene. We've all read so many different opinions about this, but I'm not seeing much on what happens if you are denied boarding. Any idea how a 14 day quarantine works if you are in Italy? Let's say you fail the temperature test, then fail the secondary test because maybe you are sneezing or your questionnaire indicates you were near some people that tested positive. Do they have space at the airport that you have to live at for 2 weeks? Do they then perform a specific cornovirus test and isolate you at a hospital while waiting for results? Or do they make you secure your own housing in Italy at our own cost and have to wait 2 weeks to try to fly then? if positive, do they admit you to a hospital? I know you won't know the answers to all of these questions, but I just can't find answers to any of them and might be flying to Italy in a month. Thanks!"
Will be heading out tonight so I have no worries coming back home.. trying to stay positive
schu0710 - I'm sure you'll have a great time and get back to the states with no problem. I'm just looking for what might happen so I can plan ahead if I'm still going to Italy.
"I think this is a good thread to start, I’m researching the same but having a hard time getting information. It would be nice to get some input and know what to do."
"JersyBrad- Understand.. It changes everyday but for me its now or never . Once I retire my finances will change and I may never go. I have been keeping up to date with CDC, embassy.gov for updates and my hospital so I know what to expect but I will go with an open mind and see what happens. I will post once I arrive and when I leave so let you know how the airport goes since I have not being hearing much about that.Edited: 3:44 pm, March 06, 2020 "
