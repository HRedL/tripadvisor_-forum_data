"We are a middle-aged couple who have been to Hawaii the last few years, but want to expand our sites this year. Looking to FP and wondering which island(s) and how many days would do a first visit justice. 10 days OK? We love the beaches, snorkeling, good food, etc. First thought was about 5 days each on Bora Bora and Moorea. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated."
"Hi RandR101:Happy to help....love your photo by the way :) Most first time visitors have Moorea & Bora Bora on their list of islands to see. A split of 5/5 as you suggest is a good one. Sometimes the resorts have stay/pay free night specials that may skew you one more or less night on an island (ie: stay 4/pay 3 etc). These two islands will make for a well rounded trip: Moorea for the majestic island beauty, amazing views, lovely beaches and friendly laid back atmosphere....then Bora Bora for its unforgettable lagoon and water activities. Ten days is a nice length of stay to be sure. Hope this helps!sunny regards,shully"
"If you want something very special, with amazing food in an amazing location and beautiful accommodation and fantastic snorkelling you will be hard pushed to beat Vahine private Island a Motu off Tahaa, and the staff were the best we came across on our 6 week tour of FP they were excellent ;-) off all the places we went I would not hesitate to go back in a heartbeat, this place is very special and so are the people."
"Paul W, I'm curious what you thought of Tikehau Pearl Beach Resort? We went to Vahine Island last year, and I agree with your assessment 100%. I've been thinking about Tikekhau, but definitely want to return to Vahine!RandR, five days each on Moorea and Bora Bora sounds like heaven. That's basically what I'm planning for next year, but I'm thinking four and four and then ending with five days on Vahine Island."
"22kauai The Tikehau Pearl Beach Resort is a lovely resort, but there is not much in the way of corals from the beaches, but they are very beautiful with pink sands leading up to the adjoining Islands/Motu, we went all along and it was fantastic and had it all to ourselves,The best snorkelling close to the resort is really under the main jetty and over water bungalows where there is some corals and lots of fish,we went with Top Dive on two occasions to snorkel in the lagoon with the Manta Rays it was one of the best times of my life, we were so close to them you could touch them, it really was magical,The only thing we felt that let the resort down was some of the staff, Having said that it really is paradise and would have loved to have stayed longer, and with the adjoining deserted Islands only separated by small shallow channels was awesome with pink sand beaches where you can go to be alone from everything and everyone if you so wished was great, we spent a hole day just lazing, fishing and snorkelling,The beach front Bungalows were beautiful with out side bathrooms ;-) You will love there and I would love to go back some day"
Thank you! It sounds wonderful!
"This is getting harder. Every time one of you makes a comment, it makes us want to stay longer and visit more places. Thanks for the help."
"We stayed at Tikehau Pearl Beach Resort after staying a week at Vahine Island and we were deeply disappointed, and kept wishing we were still at Vahine. The food at Tikehau was the worst we've had in any of our 6 trips to French Polynesia, whereas the food at Vahine is always the BEST! The staff at Tikehau wasn't friendly or accomodating at all, but then Laure, Terrence and their staff at Vahine are so fantastic that anything else would be a let down. They spoil you and meet your every need without being intrusive. The snorkeling at Vahine is much, much better too, but Tikehau does have very nice beaches. For us, we just love the remoteness and solitude of Vahine, and the fact that there are only 3 OWB's and only 8 or 9 bungalows total. Tikehau is a very large resort with so many more people, but there bungalows are some of the nicest in French Polynesia. It's all about what's most important to you, but you can't go wrong with any place in French Polynesia!"
"Re Tikehau, I think the snorkeling off Ninamu is better than Vahine, and you're just a ten minute boat ride to the manta sanctuary, and other good snorkel spots a short boat trip or SUP/kayak away, all included.On Tahaa I think the snorkeling off Le Tahaa is much better than Vahine.Having said that, I would definitely return to Vahine, although I think there's more to do on Ninamu."
"I've only been one other place where the staff is just as amazing as those on Vahine Island, and that's Anastasis Apts. in Santorini. http://anastasisapartments.com/ Sorry, this will probably be removed but couldn't help myself : ) I never thought I'd find another place as amazing as Santorini and Anastasis Apts. but I knew I'd found it on Vahine Island before we were even taken to our room."
"I don't see why it would be removed! I love hearing about similar properties to what I liked in other parts of the world. I'll have to check that place in Santorini out. Thanks, 22kauai. :-)Especially based on my last trip, I have to agree that the very good food at Vahine is a huge plus. My only small complaint is that it got too heavy for me after a few days but I've had some awful and very expensive food in FP lately and it was a pleasure having excellent food that was all included at every meal. And even me, who doesn't like yogurt, loved the homemade yogurt every morning."
"Nothing comes close to Vahine Island for snorkelling or the setting and privacy as there are only 3 over water bungalows there and 6 beach bungalows, the food is up there with the best you will get anywhere in the world it really is that good,As for the snorkelling it was the best out our 6 week trip to FP the coral gardens are pristine with lots of fish, you will see stingrays, eagle rays, sharks around your over water there and if your lucky like us you may see the Manta rays further out but still in shallow water in the lagoon! There is amazing snorkelling right alongside the Island and right over to the next Island make sure swim all the way over at the top end its awesome also take a tour with them to one of the other coral gardens close by its incredible, The Coral Gardens are pristine and colourful,And rent their little boat with the 6hp motor and go off and explore yourselves, you will have beaches and Islands and Coral gardens all to your selves unlike Bora, we also went to the coral garden next to Le Tahaa and as sheaG mentioned it is very good but I would have to say that some of the Coral gardens at and close to Vahine are as good if not better and chances are you will have it al to yourselves,And as for views get the over water bungalow nearest to Bora the views are to die for as are the sunsets, you will be pushed to find a more romantic private beautiful place anywhere in the world,The staff are the we came across while we were there FP also there were truly great and were the icing on the cake,Of all the places we have been around the world Vahine is one of the only places we would return and we will it was truly fantastic and brought a tear to my eye when we had to leave, And if you want to go to Bora you can get a day trip from there!Don't hesitate Go Vahine you will love it ;-)"
"Paul W, you must go to Ninamu (um, after the chikungunya epidemic is over). If you liked Vahine, you'll LOVE Ninamu!"
"Game On SheaG ;-)I think we went over to there with top dive to pick up a couple of clients before going to the Manta Rays, It does look very beautiful the couple said it had the giant coconut crabs there and scorpions which we would have loved to have seen....Is this the same Island?"
