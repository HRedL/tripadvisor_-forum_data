Hi I’m going to be riding my motorcycle from Ontario into Quebec and into probably route 132 around to Gaspe Bay and want to make it a loop trip coming back out to st Lawrence river . Right now New Brunswick is closed to all but Maritime residents . Is it possible to do the 132 clockwise and then come back out after crossing the interior without going into New Brunswick? My initial trip was planned to go through all of the Maritime provinces but looks like I have to stay in Quebec province. Thanks
hi this loop does not go into New Brunswick if you follow the 132 to Pointe a la Croix where there is a bridge to Campbelton NB. You can go either way. I like counterclockwise as the water is on the right side so you do not have to cross traffic to get to the viewpoints. https://goo.gl/maps/ZgiYwV6kLeX5DLtB9
"Great thank you very much, so I will turn into 132 and go counter clockwise, make sense. Now I just have to find some accommodations for July."
Enjoy your trip.
"Get your reservations - crazy busy tourist season here this year! Yes, you can easily avoid NB. You can also avoid backtracking by taking the 232, which is a nice drive too."
"Thanks for the reply , I didn't realize 232 was another option . I wish I had for sure date I'm leaving , I won't know until next Friday so to try to book ahead. My wife is a bit concerned with me riding out that way with all the cases going on so I'm stepping lightly. :)"
"I was kind of afraid of that, big flock of people and it starts up again. I think I’m going to go west instead. :)"
"""That's why we're getting so many tourists. They view the Gaspé as safe."" That's almost an oxymoron..."
I would be more concerned about riding through Quebec at the moment.
Whats going on in Quebec? I'm still undecided which way I'm going.
"So is Québec. (Undecided where it's going)(I'm not going to get into this on TA, but basically the whole government was on vacation when the pandemic hit. Since then, they've had daily news briefs, looked very pretty, handed out pie recipes, while the province single handedly lapped China. Now they're back on vacation.)Edited: 6:17 am, July 05, 2020 "
The vast majority of cases have been/are concentrated in Montreal and its surroundings ( https:/…c47900 )...this could change as people start traveling to/from that region...
"""this could change as people start traveling to/from that region..."".Yet that could be said for any region in the country... east and west.Edited: 11:36 am, July 05, 2020 "
I did a comparison of travel time to just get there between Gaspe and Banff one way Gaspe (furthest point) is about 20 hrs - https://goo.gl/maps/HxtVox4fdeN7K83r9Banff is about 35 hrs - https://goo.gl/maps/8iReScSruYzsw2989that might help you decide if you only have 2 weeks for this trip. If you have 3 weeks going out west is much easier to do without spending all your time riding.
"Cbaarch the whole point of this riding trip is the riding , I typically ride , stop take a pic and move on. I want to do this ride in a week , ride sleep and eat. :) I have a week to decide, being the way the world is right now and probably having to stay in Canada , I may have to seriously think about going west in the car with my wife in September, she rides her own bike but not hard like me. Thanks for helping me look from both angles. If I go east I would probably be looking to make it to Hawkesberry Ont for first nite stay and then perhaps picking out a route over top of Montreal and taking a ferry across the St Lawrence."
"Thanks leejay How is the Covid situation around the Gaspe peninsula circle route, I’m hearing that many from Montreal are flocking there, has it been super busy? People respecting social distancing? Lots of places to stay that are respecting the Covid expectations as well for eating? I’m very respectful with social distancing and not really a social person to start with."
"We have lots of empty space, so ""social distancing"" is pretty much normal unless you're looking for a crowd.Restaurants are all doing a pretty good job, except for the really dingy ones.Yes, all of Quebec has flocked here, and it's starting to freak out the locals. Finding a place to stay is getting complicated. If you're thinking about just pulling into a motel for the night, unlikely. Even in a down year, the end of July has people sleeping in cars. I'm also unclear if public toilets are open - mixed messages on that one.Food isn't really an issue, as there are lots of food trucks and canteens doing take out. However, my favorite ran out of food on Friday and had to shut down early after serving 100 people in one hour. So, busier than normal. Show up early! I saw a supermarket lineup at 9:15 last week.The Gaspé is doing pretty well all told, but there might be weirdnesses too. If you're looking for hotel rooms in July, it might be too late, but if you're tent camping, you might be able to get away with it. It's a weird year."
Thanks this is very helpful and much appreciated and even a bit reassuring. I will have to start looking for accommodations as soon as I get my definitate vacation date start.
"If I'm riding around the gaspe bay route 132 counter clockwise , which would be good areas/towns to stay in that wouldn't be overly crowded? I'm pretty sure I would be as far as Amqui by 5pm , could be further even, but I'm looking for places to aim for for best times of day for getting a motel. I'll be leaving Hawkesberry , Ont in the morning . Sorry really didn't know how to put the question.Thanks"
"Amqui is a bit far for my taste, but with a reservation you could be okay. Take a look at something near Mont-Joli too. Amqui is a working class town with lots of travelers under any circumstances. I'd generally look at something between St-Luce & Métis (though I normally stop in Rivière du Loup Gor that drive).Driving through the valley in the early morning is pure bliss - enjoy it! For overnighting, look at Port-Daniel, which has quite a few spots but isn't renowned. That would be about 4 hours from Amqui. There's McInnis motel, Villa Ana, Conche St-Martin and a bunch of other higher end B&B's. McDale might work for you if they're accepting people this year. https://www.macdale.com/en-gb If you don't want to stay in towns, try Le Nordet just past Percé. They just opened so might be less busy http://nordet.ca/?lang=en Another one off the beaten track is Hotel du Rocher on the north shore of the peninsula. It's in a weird spot so less busy. http://www.hotelmoteldurocher.com/ I'm not sure if that's the type of accommodation you're looking for?Edited: 7:27 am, July 06, 2020 "
"The accommodations aren't an issue , its me taking away whats suppose to be my relaxation trying to make it to the next nite stop. I may have to step it back a bit and spend the first nite on 132 closer to St Lawrence and break the rest of the 132 in half. I'm not accustomed to all this having to book ahead, I generally book 3-4 hours ahead. When we travel to Italy we always book our itinerary 9 months ahead , this is all new to me."
"With my motels booked I'm all set for next week, but I have a couple more questions. What kind of setups do they have for stopping to snack and eat ? Are there any good roadside food wagons on the 132? Are there plenty of open restroom areas, kind of like our Ontario reststops where there are toilets and usually a big Map of the are?Thanks getting excited Lynn"
