Thanks guys
"Lets hope we all get the chance to get back to lovely Cyprus soon. We have cancelled our September holiday as even if we were allowed entry, the holiday just would not be the same, ie airport, flight, bars, restaurants, beach etc,"
OP we are told by a DE that one of the doctors from th Cypriot version of sage announced that two days ago on the radio. The obvious dilema is that they can't be too presumtive withh annoucements as they are watching our R rate all the time. I expect annoucements no more than a week before at bext. Maybe only a couple of days before. I am going to risk it if I can. I have also pondered just pulling the pin but think when I am cooking a barbeque drinking a cold beer at my friends villa it won't matter if there are some restrictions around.
"They're less interested in the UK's R rate (which means trusting the figures from the government, and they aren't going to do that obviously, who would?) as looking at the actual test figures from British tourists entering Greece. That's the key statistic. And it's better in principle - rather than looking at the whole of the UK population , it is looking at a subset which is taking Mediterranean holidays."
We booked our Villa and flights last November before this terrible virus started. We were hoping to transfer the holiday until the same time next year but we were refused. Consequently we have lost a substantial deposit as we have decided to cancel altogether. Hopefully we can transfer our Jet2 flights for September flying from Newcastle to Paphos or even better Jet2 cancel the flight. All of this uncertainty has put us off returning to Cyprus this year

@Sinnayas Is that an opinion or a fact. I think we need to be clear which we are expressing.There is far too much opion stated as fact on this forum. I do try and be clear when I coment about which it is.I think it It was you that advised me to only read what is official on the Cypriot Govrnment websites. I quote the website above.
"I still do advise to look only for the official announcements.Edited: 3:33 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"I sent an email to the address on the flight pass website and had a reply from the ministry of tourism. Apparently an announcement regarding the UK is expected on Monday. We have flights on the 1st and if we can't go, unless they're cancelled, our only option will be to move the flights to another date next year, probably at some cost. I'm currently clinging on to a small thread of hope. Moving us into catagory B and insisting we get tested in the UK would make it impossible for most."
"Thats cat. That is what I was expecting, they can't announce too early in case things change. I think they update the online assesments of countries on thier website on a wee3kly basis too.I know it makes it stressful but I was concerned that they might announce the week afterwards. The big question is what the announcement will say!"
"Where do you look for announcements please?Edited: 9:37 am, July 24, 2020 "
Here you go Nickyhttps:/…fly.html
"When you think about it, testing before arrival is the only way to give holiday destinations confidence. And it should be so simple.The trouble is, the state of testing in the UK is abysmal and shameful.Madeira insist on new arrivals having been tested within 72 hours prior to arrival. Failing that they test them at the airport (free of charge). I just read a message from someone who had the test at the airport and got the result in 9 hours. Madeira have had zero deaths and only about 100 infections. That's how to do it!Compare that to the UK - lucky if you get the result back within 3 days. Pathetic."
@H0lidaymaker101 FYI Mrs Lover went for a test last week at 4pm (Luton Airport drive in) and got the results back via email and text at 9am the next morning.
"Chunky lover, I think you have to have a certificate for Cyprus, a text or email isn't good enough.Edited: 9:25 am, July 25, 2020 "
"@17 actually I think our testing is now plentiful and efficient. The issue is that it is designed to deal with Covid, to identify infection and get people back to work, not for use by holidaymakers. Even if you are eligible for a NHS test and hope to use it for these purposes, then at the moment the Cypriot authorities have not decided wheter or not that test resullt via text and email is acceptable.We are therefore at the mercy of private companies which are all extortionate and for the most use post which makes them unsuitable due to timeframes.It is human nature to blame, but the only thing to blame is the virus.Without category A I think most people will still not be on the plane."
"I think Chunklover was responding to the assertion that it takes three days to get test results back in the UK, not suggesting that an NHS test would be suitable for the flight pass."

Tested at 3pm and result at 5am next morning -negative thankfully but a quick turn around......
Was that an NHS testing centre or private.
"I wrote to the Cypriot tourism office to query testing (I don’t want to choose a private clinic that the Cypriot authorities don’t accept) and this is the response I got:‘’ Thank you for your interest to travel to Cyprus In regard to your question, assuming that UK is in category B , we know that NHS sends the results in form of a text-email.You can make this text into a pdf file and then upload it to the flight pass (the system will ask you to do it when you fill in the flight pass)You can also take the test at Lloyds Pharmacies(99GBP)’’I personally will not be using the NHS test for this purpose, but if you did have a ‘text email’ as they refer to above then it seems this evidence is acceptable.Edited: 11:35 am, July 25, 2020 "
As time moves on I would think it would be extremely unlikely that the UK would move into Cat A in just over one weeks time. Things need to get a whole lot better here before Cyprus will want us there imo.
Lloyd's say there test is not suitable for this purpose it provides an online result.The UK embassy in Nicosia said yesterday on FB that the Cypriots are undecided on NHS results via text and email.I didn't think to uploaded anything to Flight Pass just declare you have the cert and have it available to show on entry.
what @Armchairloco said
"HI, Just wondering if you managed to get into Cyprus ok with your NHS test, we are due to go on 7th August and am really confused about the process."
"Don’t see how you can use a NHS test as Cyprus require a hard copy showing date of test and result,all you get off NHS test is an email which is not acceptable,so we are back to square one."
They now say that they will accept an email if it had name DOB and date of test. It varies as to wheter those items will be on there.
500 out of a total population of over 60 million is a very small percentage
"Not saying a NHS test ethically right , but some people just couldn’t afford to . And we all pay our taxes and test centres are quiet ( especially where I am) But the NHS result definitely needs to be confirmed as an acceptable pass result ??Has anything official been said. ?"
"What worries me is I have the NHS test,arrive in Cyprus on the 6th Aug and them saying it isn't the correct paperwork and sending me home, if I could afford the private tests I would pay for them,I didn't budget for an extra £1000 when I booked my holiday in January.Edited: 12:56 am, July 28, 2020 "
I feel the same. I fly on Sunday 2nd so it gives no time to hear what the Cypriot people are accepting in the way of test results. I’m really hoping we can pay for a test on arrival. Fingers crossed for further announcements today.
"Hayley, you need to be arranging some sort of test to have friday, I really wouldn't go just hoping you can get a test there...better to go with something being this close to their supposing announcement."
"Yes there could be futher announcements but if not then you will need to sort something UK-wise or not go. Only testing on arrival for countries that are specified.I have seen on here differenet messages from authorities in Cyprus which contradict and some which can't be correct. Visit Cyprus messaged me on FB yesterday to say that an NHS result via email is ok if it contains date of test name and DOB. Hopwever they also said to upload that to Flight pass. I do not see where you upload anything only enter data and make declarations so it does not inspire confidence in the message I recieved.Edited: 3:43 am, July 28, 2020 "
When are you due to go John the fish?
"I have emailed the Deputy Minister of Tourism this morning to see if UK fall into the below clause:Persons, in countries category B, where the authorities of these countries, are not in a position to offer Covid-19 testing to those wishing to travel to the Republic of Cyprus and following an announcement by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus, passengers of these Countries are permitted to perform the COVID-19 test upon their entry to the Republic of Cyprus.I have received the below response:PCR Test, is necessary for all ages, no exceptions from B Category Countries. The PCR Covid-19 test must be done within the time frame set by the Republic of Cyprus and it should be done in the country of origin. Cyprusflightpass is also mandatory. Failing to present both, one risks fine and or deportation. So I will definitely be needing to get something booked and just keep everything crossed the results get back in time."
I’ve seen two peoples Nhs Covid result emails/texts and they categorically do not have the date of test on it.
Agree the NHS one just says it was negative when the test was done no date.
"Just checked my sons negative test email,definitely no date on it."
"Oh, so now what?Do you get any confirmation for booking your test? Maybe that can be used?"
Read an article in last weeks Paphos newspapers that holiday companies from UK have told Cypress authorities that they will not take holiday makers to Cyprus unless UK is in Cat A by 1st August? Be interesting to see if Jet2 etc fly people out on this date.
"it was already reported a couple of weeks ago that Jet2 and TUI would be cancelling all flights/holidays to Cyprus if the UK was not put into cat A by August 1st and that they would not resume holidays there until August the 15th at the earliest and that would only be if the UK was put into cat A by then. Easyjet and Ryanair are still flying out to Cyprus from the UK even in July so they are not cancelling all their flights just some as i believe they are running reduced schedules as there isn't much demand at the moment for flights from the UK to cyprus at the momentEdited: 2:18 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"@Givey, the regualtions about flights and holidays differ. Mickey is totally correct, the package holiday companies cancelled some time ago over the testining limitations. I think (sadly) the 15th Augsut red line may well be crossed too as the package companies need 3 weeks minimum to re-energise.Those of us with flights will lose our money with no refund.In my totally un-informed view i suspect an annoucement around the 8th August on A rating starting in September so that the hotels etc can get something out of the year. (only my gueses and of no use to me as my flights are in August)All the best!"
