CAAN issues guidelines to operate flights @ https://risingnepaldaily.com/main-news/caan-…
"Wow, not many passengers will be permitted to board, given that the article states they must have a temperature of 38 degrees FAHRENHEIT or lower. And of course, anyone who met that condition would be dead anyway."
Few will have seen people below 38 F - that is the norm for morgues...
Maybe the article meant to refer to the air transportation of Covid-19 fatalities. That would explain the temperature requirement.
Could be worse. At least it's not °K.
RE #4: That would herald a new ice age.
