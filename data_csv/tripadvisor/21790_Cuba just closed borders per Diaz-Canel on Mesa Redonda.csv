Just got a text about this but no more details. Returning Cubans will be allowed in but then quarantined for 15 days.
Very sensible too.
Goes into effect Tuesday and will last for 30 days per digitaljournal.com/news/…569054
FWIW: I cancelled my 30 March trip this morning out of social consciousness not a fear of being infected in Cuba. Total refund from jetBlue for a non-refundable ticket.
"Bob, that links not working for me..is there another one.....it says I should download some virus software?"
Lori:Strange but it works perfectly for me here in the UK:
"Good news - while they will suffer from the lack of tourism, they are wise to shut it down!!"
"Yes, just been watching.60,000 foreign visitors still in country to be removed at a rate of c. 13,000+ per day.cubadebate.cu/noticias/…anexo-1339171"
LoriM #4: try https://news.yahoo.com/cuba-closes-borders-n… same message

Well it was only a matter of time . No SUPRISE to me . Everyone thinking they will just do on with their trips like nothing is happening . Well Wake up and Smell the Coffee for crying out loud Its a freaking world crisis . Johnny C
Hola Johnny CWould that be Cuban coffee? Or will any kind do????Cheers
is the president in cuba or still in france? carol e
Diaz Canel ? When was he in France ?
Cuba now has 20 active cases. That just doubled within the last 24 hours. https:/…countriesTerry
That is how it works. Nothing for the longest time then the seal is broken and off the virus goes.
"Looks like they're closing the boarders just in time. Think back when the first cases were diagnosed...the virus had already done its thing and is still doing it right now...we should expect a lot more cases in the next week. Time to shut down the country as much as possible and fight back! Of course I'm no biologist, but I do recognize patterns :)"
"The virus knows no borders. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning. But I do believe Cubans will be taking this very seriously.......they are a resourceful and yet socially responsible people. They will heed any government mandates.......to all our Cuban friends, please stay safe and healthy!"
My long time friend has a man in lock down in the next building. So his building and ones around him have been told to stay inside.My friend has not needed to be told. She and family are not going out any time soon.They know what is needed to be done .
"My wife Judi is continuing to go to her veterinary clinic each day... she says the people with sick animals need her. But for the past few days and again on Monday she needs to visit the campo to inoculate horses at the rate of 75 per day. They're all due for their annual parasite shots, something she does every year for them. I suggested that she stay at the casa now and self-isolate... she said that is simply not possible. Judi is fully aware of the situation in Cuba regarding the threat of the virus but told me that her work must go on no matter what happens in the future as those horses, pigs, cows, and oxen (as well as many dogs and cats) are what will help to sustain the population throughout this crisis. Her work as a veterinarian has been deemed an essential-service. Instead of half-days, she's now working full-days to help contribute more too.Terry"
Working outside as I assume she is in dealing with livestock is likely to be safer than being confined inside with others. Best of luck to her.
"Yes, I agree, eeefarm. But that's not always the case. She regularly visits various casas within the city as well where people have their sick pigs in coral to be attended to. She's young though (now 30) so she shouldn't have much trouble recovering should she contract the virus. Thanks for your best wishes. Scary times for all of us ahead.Terry"
re 16 - Terry - from 15 to 20 is not double !
"I think it's 21? Last few jumps - 7, 10, 11, 16, 21."
Y - yes but Terry was quoting active cases which does not include the one who died. So I deducted 1 from the previous day’s figure too.
"Y - Terry was quoting active cases, which does not include the guy who died. So I deducted 1 from the previous days figure as well."
the president of cuba and the mrs. were in paris when I left cuba according to my cuban working friends. carol e.
carol - strange that was not reported anywhere.
"beardo, I'm a bit late coming back to you, but there were only 10 active cases in Cuba before quickly jumping to 15 and then on up to 20... all within a 24 hour period of time. If I'm off by a few hours, what does that really matter? The reality of the current situation is much more important.Terry"
"Terry - the 24 hour jump was 15 to 20 or 16 to 21 depending on how you count. Neither is ""double"". At times like these, it is best to give facts, not half truths or misreadings."
"But I can still pee further than you... does that count for anything?? beardo, with all due respect, give me a break. I'm surprised that you feel it necessary to continue making an issue of that as though it really matters.Terry"
Cuban gov't just announced 10 additional (7 Cubans & 3 Canadians). Number is now 35 confirmed.
It does matter.By saying it has doubled can set people off fearing what may not be there.Just start to think it is not all about you and your life.
Mierda! The curve is happening there now too. Terry
"Diva, it has doubled... and now more than tripled from 10. If it wasn't within 24 hours, who cares? The fact that it has now more than tripled is the current point! Terry"
It had not when you started spouting out.
"In just a short time since you wrote this post, Cuba no has 139/plus cases, and as of tomorrow morning (April 14th, 2020) Ford will announce another 28 days of isolation and social distancing for those who absolutely have to go out. Is so sad that unfortunately that it's not over yet and that it's going to get worse before it gets better. I hope all is well with your wife, and you as well, because I'm sure it can't be easy for you.  I was already on pins and needles before the COVID-19 epidemic began, hence why I had plans to go to Cayo Coco, Cuba, I was devastated when my trip was cancelled, so being at high risk I'm on complete lockdown, with anxiety that has me extra precautious. But like EVERYONE around the world it SO important that we do our part, and be respectful of the do's and don't's, it's a time of teaches, and I believe we're all going to learn valuable lessons. Stay safe one and ALL!"
"Link is working fine for me..........I was amazed to hear there were still 60,000 tourists in the country.Are there still any AI resorts open? Or are people staying in casas, and ''in town"" hotels ?I think Cuba is very wise to close her borders, for now.As soon as things are back to normal, we will be back, but we want to find the people who we have come to know and care about, safe and well !Barb"
Cherie 139/plus cases .Well as of today Cuba has 726 in total .Barb Casas are close to tourists .As for hotels i know some tourists were in some hotels waiting to get back home only one problem no flights to bring them back .
"Sorry......I must sound a bit daft ! I did not look at the date on that original post when I responded to it .....duh !I am just catching up with the rest of the world, and especially Cuban news, so please excuse my senior moment(s)Barb"
"I am not sure why Cherie chose to revive a three week old thread.On the numbers of visitors, a report last week said that in Cuba, 12 698 people remain, of them 5 633 foreigners and 7 065 emigrants. 988 foreigners are still staying in rental casas. cubadebate.cu/noticias/…"
"I choose to reply for a few reasons, one to see how his wife was doing, and second because in such a short time this forum has taken place, COVID-19 has had a rippling effect, so much devastating and uncertainty, and thirdly because I care and worry some about other's. Be well and be safe."
You sound like a cheese cake I used to know Cheri Lee :) Sorry...nice of you to care when we need it the most...it's tough everywhere right now...you be safe also :)
