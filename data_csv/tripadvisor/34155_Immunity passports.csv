Some countries are discussing using immunity passports for entry to their country. Would the US use this?
Ask the US Gov rather than a random bunch of strangersNobody has confirmed if there is an accurate test that will conform immunity as nobody knows yet if you can develop covid19 immunityI don't see them being used or accepted in the short or medium term.
I don’t see it
>>Would the US use this?<<I don’t know.
"Can't see any legality in the US. Granted, there seems to be a disregard of the constitution during all of this."
US won't do it unless the democrats win the presidency and both house of Congress with 2/3 majorities....not likely to happen.
"I hope this does not happen, would extremely limit international travel u til a vaccine becomes available"
"I'd prefer a COVID-19 check being done on all air passengers prior to them being admitted onto the aircraft. The cost of this could be added to the airfare.It's been suggested that a test done up to 3 days prior to travel would be valid.Results from these tests are available within 15 minutes, and a test certificate could be issued to be used in conjunction with a boarding pass.Edited: 10:33 am, May 11, 2020 "
"So you are going to have a passport which states ""This person was not sick when tested on 5-11-2020."" What good will that do anyone next June?"
The passport will state that you already had the virus and now ammune.
"kt, I think they're talking about some confirmation that a person has the antibodies.Presuming that they can demonstrate that having antibodies is actually significant.Presuming that the testing can be determined to be reliable.In any event, I don't see it being rolled out in the US."
"It sounds like a dumb idea to me. Like ktinca said above, unless you are tested days before you are going to travel, there is no way to know for sure if you are infected. It seems to me the only way to do this safely is after a vaccine is available to everyone. But, like our current President said, it's going to magically go away, so I guess we might as well just start flying all over the world because of a magic prediction."
"Has nothing to do with if you are currently infected or not.“Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate” that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection.”"
"@Mr NiceGuy (Post #9) - ""The passport will state that you already had the virus and now ammune.""I see reports that re-infection does occur. Having the antibodies is no guarantee against re-infection."
Actually Goodbeer describes that type of passport very well.
Seems like a bad idea all around....
"That would be such a HIPAA violation, at least with regards to US citizens, and I doubt the UK and other countries would be okay with forcing their citizens to get tested to meet US regulations."
Why ??

"Have not seen a coin pusher machine in a long time, at least 20 years ago."
