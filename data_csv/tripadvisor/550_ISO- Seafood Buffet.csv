You want to go to the part of Florida with the most Covid-19 cases and eat at a buffet?
"I'm thinking, that at least in the short term, any sort of buffet is a thing of the past."
I completely agree with Jean H.
There will probably be no buffets for a very long time. They will be one of the last things to come back post covid-19.
