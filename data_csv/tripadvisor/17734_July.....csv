Are any other travellers keeping there travel plans for Italy in July?
"Yes, but with diminishing hope. People are overlooking the intention behind the quarantine, which isn’t to eradicate the virus (which isn’t yet possible) but to replace an uncontrollable epidemic with a series of smaller ones, which hopefully local health services can cope with. They know that, without a vaccine or cure, the virus is going to spread through the population anyway, and when the quarantine (which will be the first of a series, count on it) is lifted, they expect an epidemic. Indeed the intention is for epidemic to be allowed - so that a proportion of the population becomes infected, and then everyone will be locked away at home again. In time we reach the point where progress of the virus is slowed down by the large number of people with immunity, until the virus either mutates into a less harmful form, becomes a normal fact of life, or can be countered by a vaccine.Listen to the medical experts, rather than the politicians (who can’t really admit the intent behind the plan), and all of this is quite clear.What this means for summer travel is that countries will be having a planned mini-epidemic, after which the intention is to bring down the quarantine again. By then it’ll be the same in other countries, including the US (although who knows what craziness that administration will be doing by then).Very sadly, I am fast coming to the conclusion that 2020 can be written off as far as travel is concerned.Edited: 6:08 am, March 13, 2020 "
At the current rate by the end of April every single person in Italy will be infected 1.5 times. That's assuming the current 10k infected includes everybody. Of course it doesn't since many people show no symptoms. In other words long before July 80% have virtually no symptoms.
