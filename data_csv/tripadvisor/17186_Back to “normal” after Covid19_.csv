"Things are starting to look quite normal except for the lack of foreign tourists which is wonderful. ;-)Masks obligatory on all public transportation, museums and many shops."
Must be magical especially for the locals the “lack” of tourists. So should we come ? What is your opinion? Thank you ♥️
"k2Your lack of ""foreign tourists"" will soon be shattered by many beautiful and wonderful people. Certainly as soon as a vaccine has been circulated to fend off the present scourge ... and maybe, some, like my good self a lot earlier than that.CheersAnthony K"
"MelinaFrom all I read I would encourage you to visit, with a good supply of decent masks.EnjoyAnthony K"
"It is really an excellent time to visit Paris. Bring your masks, dine out-of-doors (easier now than it has ever been), and enjoy minimal sized crowds. Weather has been fantastic as well, highs around 25 to 28 and cool evenings."
Actually probably right now and early fall will be the best...things could change when everyone needs to move inside...dining options might be more uncomfortable and limited etc. but right now with masks...using some common sense distancing should be nice without the tourist herds.
"I'm going to the theatre tonight. That is unexpectedly soon, and I will be very curious to see how it is all handled. It is a very large theatre (Théâtre de la Colline) and I assume that they have only sold half of the seats."
K2 it will be interesting to hear how they handle that. Leaving seats empty is easy but getting people in and out will be tricky.

My husband and I plan a month in France leaving from Montreal on Aug 31. We go every year. Right now they aren't allowing tourists from the US. We also won't go if we have to quarantine for 2 weeks. What's your guess as to both of those being eliminated by our departure date? I think I can cancel our air now and get a credit for future travel.
"** I really , REALLY don’t want to cancel it . It’s my dream destination . Do you think we will enjoy it ? **According to post #5, it seems like a propitious time to visit Paris. The scarcity of international tourists makes access easier to sites and less crowding is certainly a boon in these times. Enjoy your trip and keep safe."
"********What's your guess as to both of those being eliminated by our departure date? My guess is that as soon as the USA depoliticizes the virus, progress will be made and the EU will open to Americans. With the infection rates as high as they are right now, change will take some time."
"#10–Anne, as far as I know, none of us on the Paris forum have any “in’s” with the powers that be. All we know is the EU is reviewing entry every 2 weeks, and that the next batch of allowed visitors should drop in a day or two. I’m doubtful the the US will make the list in the next month or more, unless they institute a “test upon arrival” procedure as some places are doing, or decide to allow travelers with a negative Covid test within A certain number of days prior to travel, as other places are starting to do. But I haven’t heard any rumors that the EU is considering anything like that."
"If you're an American, you can't travel to Canada (Montreal) and if you were allowed - you would have to quarantine for 14 days."
"*********** to allow travelers with a negative Covid test within A certain number of days prior to travel, as other places are starting to do.The French are planning on testing everyone at the airport just like Greece does. Arrangement are being made, according to the local news, to have kits available at the airports in the near future.Arrival testing will have nothing to do with specifically allowing Americans into the EU. That decision is made in Brussels."
"""I'm going to the theatre tonight. "" I remember something called a theatre; concert hall too. I don't know when we'll have those again here in Maine. And our state has probably been the best in the US at combatting the virus. But still no theatres or concert halls."
Thank you for your response ! ♥️
I’m curious also ! Inform us how it went if it’s not a trouble ♥️
Leaving the theatre tonight was very well handled -- the staff had people file out by row through specific doors. It was a bit like airline boarding procedures.
"Merci Sarastro, Do you know when they meet again to re-evaluate allowing Americans into France?Merci"
Our theaters have been cancelled to the end of the year today.
At the moment you will not be able to enter Canada. The issue is to be examined by July 21. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the border closed. Things may change in August but not if the current trends of Covid continue in the US.
"*********Do you know when they meet again to re-evaluate allowing Americans into France?Brussels reevaluates every two weeks. However, country’s with infection rates higher than those of EU countries remained banned. Infection rates in the USA are going up, not down; Americans will likely wait for EU entry a lot longer than anyone originally estimated."
Does anyone knows to tell me if i have to do a Covid test before my arrival to Paris of at my arrival ? No one seems interested in Cyprus to inform us
"""Americans will likely wait for EU entry a lot longer than anyone originally estimated."" That's for sure. When our April trip to France was cancelled we quickly pivoted to Canada, then the border closed. We briefly considered going to France in October, but we decided it was too iffy, so we again switched our tentative plans to Canada, figuring that would be OK. Now that doesn't look too promising. My state has brought things pretty well under control, but a large part of the US is just getting worse. Hopefully things will improve starting November 5."
"@ Melina in post 27, see post 15 for the answer.@ Bob in post 28, I hope that things in the U.S. improve soon, before November and that all of us with cancelled 2020 trips will be able to travel to Europe in 2021."
@MrandMrsJas thank you so much for your response. So we will get tested at the airport as i see . Do you know the cost dear ? Thank you in advance ♥️
# 25 Canadian border will remain closed for Americans for next month (as of 1 hr. ago) and its reviewed every month.
"Melina, Cyprus is a EU country and there is free entry in France at the moment, no testing required. The tests are for ""red list countries"" (ie not in EU/Schengen/UK and not on the approved EU list of countries).Here a paper article in French : https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2020…Here the official website with a bit in English in the middle : https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/Com… (but no mention of the testing protocol, I can't find an official information about this).Edited: 11:28 am, July 14, 2020 "
Soph5053 I really thank you . You are all so kind and helpful! It’s a bit difficult to say the least to find correct informations since must we find are in french and unfortunately you don’t understand anything ♥️ I noticed that people from France are really helpful and willing to help ! Again thank you my dear ♥️
"Almost everything is open now, and Paris is still devoid of tourists, so anyone visiting now is probably having a pretty good time. The only people out and about are Parisians themselves. It's a very different and calmer atmosphere."
"Here are five minutes in Montmartre. Compared to normal, I notice that there are way fewer people. And they all seem to be speaking French (i.e., they're local). Most shops and restaurants are open, but a few famous restaurants are closed (including the Moulin Rouge), which is ominous. And souvenir stores aren't doing much business. The artists seem to be mostly out of town. But no lines or crowds, and everyone is relaxed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUaeCU78EQ8"
"The situation in Paris now, as noted in the last couple of posts, would suit me fine as a visitor, who will relish more space in Galleries and Museums to appreciate great artworks, even though it is seven weeks until I visit and things may change... I wish it were sooner.To help everyone, perhaps locals could answer these points about mask wearing at present.On leaving one's Hotel, say, for a days sightseeing is it mandatory to wear ...A) Masks everywhere at all times, except when actually eating or drinking out and about?B) Masks only on all Public Transport and in all Retail units, Museums, Galleries and the like?C) Masks only on Public Transport and encouraged in Retail Units, Museums & Galleries? D) Masks only expected to be worn in enclosed spaces eg Public Transport and indoor units?Finally, if masks are mandatory, anywhere, are any locals aware of ""on-the-spot"" fines being given?Thank-you for any and all your help on this.Keep well allAnthony K"
"It will change on August 1: masks everywhere indoors, no mask outdoors."
"Melina you can use Deepl online translation tool, it's much better than Google Translate : https://www.deepl.com/translatorPaste your text in the first box, choose ""français"" in the first drop-down menu and ""anglais"" in the second one, and then click on the arrow between both boxes.

News article in English about wearing masks starting Aug. 1 https:/…
"Anthony, that will be the situation in Paris as of 1 August.I live quite close to where you are staying, and I can tell you that local shops all require masks already, they have signs on the window saying so, and they will refuse entry to those without masks. Some also limit the number inside at any one time, so there can be queues outside. It seems we are a fairly law-abiding part of town, because I rarely see anyone on the bus without a mask. The few times I have seen it, the other passengers have spoken up and mostly the person gets off. I haven't seen anyone fined, but it seems quite possible to me that there could be spot checks. When we had to have attestations to go outside, there were thousands of fines, but I only actually saw one case in personThere aren't any exemptions from wearing masks. I have a rare lung disease, and my pneumologist told me to practice getting used to the mask, as the alternative is to be confined indoors again. Even so, she has recommended to me to be very careful when out and about."
"Masks are currently required on public transportation and most retailers require masks to enter their stores. August 1st, masked become compulsory within all enclosed spaces. I wear a mask when I leave my apartment and continue to wear it until my return unless eating. I care about health and do not worry about fines or disciplinary action for not wearing a mask. On the streets, a small percentage of the public wear masks, maybe not even 30%, but in retail spaces, I see 100% mask compliance."
"Thanks for those wonderful replies in the last few posts, especially AllyParis. If August 1st brings those restrictions who knows what September 1st might bring. Anything, I hope, except a second wave of the scourge and further lockdowns.I value this Forum highly and am really sincere in my thanks for the time you have taken.Annette - I will certainly read that article.Keep well allSee you soonAnthony K"
"AnnetteThanks ... these words, from the article, sum it up nicely .."" PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron said masks would be required in indoor public places by Aug. 1 ... ""Keep wellAnthony K"
Oh i love the no crowds no lines ! I believe it’s magical now ! If from 1st of August mask are mandatory only indoors that’s great ! We should all be careful of course ♥️
"Oh, there were lines the morning -- the summer sales started (until just August 11 because the duration has been reduced). There were quite a few shops at the Westfield Forum that were making people queue up outside."
"Whatever the situation is come early September, I have obtained date and timed entrance tickets for all the Museums and Galleries that I wish to visit excepting The Petit Palace, where it seems I will not need one for the permanent collection.I have bought tickets in advance for Galleries that have often been quiet in the past and where we have just turned up and strolled straight in - Delacroix, Maillol and Marmottan Museums. I have a Museum Pass to cover the Picasso, Judaisme, Orangerie and Orsay Museums.Now I have to look to August to book a couple of evening events.Keep well allAnthony K"
"The municipal museums of Paris, including the Petit Palais, are free, so you can go to any of them without a ticket (unless covid has changed things). The main thing to know about Paris municipal museums is that they are closed on Mondays whereas the national museums are closed on Tuesdays.But I'm sure you also know that there are a few exceptions -- such as the fact that the Orsay and Versailles are open on Tuesday and closed on Monday to compensate for the other closures.Obviously all of this is pretty meaningless at the moment (and maybe even in September). To use an off topic example, Disneyland Paris reopened today and had only 7000 (obligatory) reservations when normal daily attendance at this time of year is 80,000.. Even with the current restrictions, they can accept more than 30,000 visitors a day."
"k2Thanks for your comments. I have gotten used to Museums and Galleries closing once a week, in many Cities around Europe. Thankfully the Internet makes planning so much easier than in the past.As for gaining tickets in advance, then it is simply that, first, I was able to do it and secondly, I have had to do it for a visit to The National Gallery, in London, tomorrow, and that made me more inclined to be sure of getting to see, once again, that which I desire to see, once again.Keep wellAnthony K"
"So colleagues, residents essentially ... How are things at present? With borders open to many countries, now, are you aware of new Covid19 cases being low or have you noted a second surge?Has there been any specific new announcements from French authorities with reference to the imposition or lifting of any restrictions in the next few weeks?ThanksKeep well allAnthony K"
"Cases are on the rise (slowly) in many areas. Starting tomorrow, masks will be mandatory in all enclosed public spaces (shops, museums, indoor markets, post office, banks...)."
The numbers fall when everybody wears masks. (hint hint to a big country where a lot of people are against masks)
"Masks may be part of the solution but they are not the be-all and end-all of preventing a second wave, across Europe, or a second surge.Note - In the Catalonia region of Spain, the Capital, Barcelona is now under a new lockdown and although people can land at BCN, and visit some areas, the City itself is a no-no. Obviously these things, on various websites, are updated very often, at present.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Masks don't make much difference. A vaccine or treatment could make a difference. Otherwise the epidemic will simply run its course, masks or no masks."
"EuormanicI tend to agree with you in regard to mask wearing and how much that prevents passing on ""droplets,"" or receiving them from others, especially if social distancing is not observed. I am not coming out to Paris until September 7th and I am aware, as so many are now, that things change almost daily.Having said that I am cognisant of many who are reading these Forums as newbies and I think that it is good that regulars provide updated information as the picture changes.As you all, in Paris, may be aware we, in the UK, are facing a mandatory facemask order, from July 24th, for all indoor venues.As I find facemasks an anathema, because of health issues, I may be able to present a card showing that I have an exemption, in the UK. I doubt very much, that this would have a positive effect in Paris.We shall see what we shall see as time passes. If there is not a sudden second wave, with accompanying spikes, across mainland Europe, hopefully the situation will improve.C'est la vieAnthony K"
According to public health experts masks do prevent the spreading of droplets and people whose health is so bad that they can't wear masks should not be putting themselves in a position where they are in confined spaces with other irresponsible people. If you can't wear a mask then stay at home or go out to the countryside or a park in your car. Nobody has a right to be in Paris without a mask in enclosed spaces- health problems or not. If I was a French official I would ignore a doctors letter.
"If you have breathing issues that are serious enough to prevent you from wearing a mask for a limited period of time, I wonder if it's wise to travel at the moment and increase your risks of catching a virus that may very well be fatal to you (and that you may pass on to people you meet along the way). There are a lot of models of masks, you can find one that is more comfortable for you."
"'As I find facemasks an anathema, because of health issues, I may be able to present a card showing that I have an exemption, in the UK. I doubt very much, that this would have a positive effect in Paris'Correct, Anthony, it will not have a positive effect. There are no exemptions here, and the few people who cannot wear or cannot get used to wearing them are advised not to go out, for their own safety.I have a rare lung disease which results in constant shortness of breath, and I had to practice for a while before I could feel comfortable in a facemask, but now I wear one as required, including for my kinesitherapy exercises twice a week. It is required in all medical settings, and on my regular hospital trips, I see people who are really quite ill wearing them. It is amazing what you can get used to if you have to."
"Announced today, there will be a fine of 135€ for not wearing a maskhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.france24.co…"
"I have an absolute aversion to Nazi dictatorships, and I am well aware of what will be good for my health and the health of others, when I am, once again, more regularly out and about.My belief is that ""2 metre social distancing"" is far more effective than a facemask, whatever it's construction.As I have stated before, though I may not have great faith in them, I am still experimenting with masks to find one that does not cause severe breathing difficulties after 5 or 10 minutes of wearing. I am also awaiting the delivery of a visor. One wonders if a person is wearing a transparent visor, without a mask beneath it, the authorities will feel that that is inadequate and take action. I am 68 and I live alone ... there is only so much Skyping you can do and only so many times you can ask neighbours and friends to assist your daily programme.I love vacations and have a real fondness for City Breaks, across Europe and further afield.Putting all things into perspective, and monitoring many websites daily, I fully expect to visit Paris in early September.C'est la vieAnthony K"
"Some people believe that the earth is flat, it doesn't make it any less round. I also have an aversion to Nazi dictatorship, but I really don't see what it has to do with wearing a mask in public places. If you are comparing the requirement to put a mask in public places to the Nazi regime, then by forum traditions this should mark the end of this discussion."
"No. But I was close to suicide, more than once, during my twelve weeks within my four walls. Just would not allow my Government to use Covid19 to cull the elderly population in my nation.Anthony K"
"From the Lancet, a highly-respected, peer-reviewed medical journal: ""Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection...""The full article, with much more nuance than I could present here, is here: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltextThe way I see it, each protective measure taken against the virus is like a slice of Emmental cheese. Yes, there may be holes in a single slice of cheese. But if you add another slice on top of that slice and another slice on top of that slice and another slice on top of that slice, then you should do a decent job of covering the holes. (To beat the metaphor into the ground: washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds is one slice of cheese; staying 1 metre away from others is the second slice of cheese; wearing a face mask is the third slice of cheese; etc.)**The Samaritans offer free help to anyone experiencing mental health distress: https:/…"
"2 metre v 1 metre social distancing, now. Once people put on a mask social distancing goes out of the window, from what I've observed...Anthony K"
A paper from a researcher at the University of Padua suggests that wearing face masks encourages others to keep proper distancing. The paper is awaiting peer review: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12446.pdf
I have a string aversion to people who think their 'rights' take precedence over those of others. If you can't wear a mask then stay away from places where they are required.

C MarloweI may have to do some more in depth research but I am sure that the French authorities when imposing the wearing of Facemasks would have addressed the issue of some exemption and there may well be some.Anthony K
"And even if Anthony could get a personal exemption from the face mask requirements, such an exemption wouldn't come from the TA Paris forum. He's been told what the rules are.

"I did a bit of research and saw that in Belgium, one can be authorised to wear just a plastic visor if one has obtained a permit from the Belgian health authorities. I hear that Brussels is lovely in September. (Actually, I know that for a fact because I have visited Brussels during all seasons since I dearly love that city.) France does not appear to have any exemptions presently"
There are probably exemptions that apply to a specific segment of the population. I doubt that they extend to tourists who want to visit the Louvre.
"Why should tourists, in this respect, be treated any differently to French people who may be suffering the same or similar the Health problems as those of us who wish to visit and stimulate the French economy?Anthony K"
...or selfish British tourists who want to visit the Louvre.
"I will not be visiting the Louvre ,on this occasion, but several other Galleries and Museums which I am sure will delight me as much as they have during many other visits.Anthony KEdited: 11:28 am, July 20, 2020 "
"I take it, then, Anthony, that your plans have changed. Since November of 2019, you've been rather adamant about visiting the Louvre in September 2020:- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…- https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…In fact, if I remember correctly, your visit to the Louvre was set in stone because you were going to give a lecture to a group of students. (I remember because I was interested and wanted to know if I could attend. I like learning new things. But I have no plans of going to Paris in September now, because it is advisable to avoid all unnecessary travel, which a touristic visit is.) Anyway, it's fine that your plans have changed. Many people's plans have. The broader point that OffalyRover was making, I think, was that a sightseeing trip is not necessary travel, whether the destination is the Louvre, Crazy Horse or the Eiffel Tower.Edited: 11:43 am, July 20, 2020 "
"edefran ... Your memory serves you well. I was going to do an on-sight lecture, and Q&A session, with a student group at the Louvre. This has been postponed because a number of the students, who are now back at home, are living in countries from which they cannot return to Paris and it is unlikely their education will resume as normal in September.I may have the chance to tour the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire et du Judaisme with a senior curator and discuss, with him the works of Marc Chagall.Keep wellAnthony K"
AllMay I say that there must be many far more interesting issues than my vacation.Let's return this thread to general Coronavirus issues. Anthony K
"I can only post here and say what I see where I live inTexas. Infections are rising in Texas and people are arguing about wearing masks, some saying it’s a conspiracy to take away your rights, others saying masks don’t work, others that they have health conditions that prevent masks wearing. My daughter is a nurse who does Covid testing during her work day. Masks work. They aren’t perfect, nothing is, but they will work to stem the spread if people would just work together for the common good instead of fighting about it. Let me also say that in my opinion it is not fair to go to another country and think you can get away with not following the rules set in place to protect their citizens. If you can get an exemption in your own country from wearing a mask, then visit the places in your own country you may have overlooked until there is a vaccine. We love Paris and have been every year since 2006. Our plan for this next year was to retire and spend a year in Paris. We had been looking at visa requirements and had been looking at apartments. But it’s not going to happen this year. Hopefully next year but who knows. All I know for sure is that we will go when we are able to go."
"You are wasting your time with Anthony, his selfish needs come before public health in Paris. Hopefully he will be denied access to places which require masks."
"*****Hopefully he will be denied access to places which require masks.Virtually everywhere requires a mask. If someone does not want to wear a mask for any reason, he has the option to remain outdoors."
They wanted us to wear them while getting on and off the chairlift today even though we were outside. She just explained it was to protect the operators. No problem .
"Masks are mandatory in all indoor spaces in France as of today. In my local Monop I saw the cashier turn away someone who tried to enter without a mask. The person merely forgot and then walked outside and put on their mask. Every supermarket in my town also has hand sanitizer at the entry. No one here is complaining about wearing a mask, at least in my town."
"If we could go to Paris right now, I would wear them inside and outside as needed. We absolutely want you to do whatever we can to be safe and hopefully get this thing under control. I have a few friends who have had it. Some did not have severe cases but one friend’s husband and 80 year old father ended up in the hospital. You just don’t know how it will hit you. Luckily they are both ok now. It’s scary.Edited: 12:58 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"I was really impressed with the supermarket in Aime which had sanitizer, sanitizer for the trolley handle plus disposable gloves."
"I’m tentatively planning a trip to France in August. I will of course be wearing a mask wherever it’s mandatory and I would expect everyone else to do so too. Especially people that, like me, are guests in France. Being able to travel to other countries these days is not a right, it’s a privilege that should be treasured not taken lightly.I do have a question regarding masks. Are they readily available in pharmacies or supermarkets? Or is there a shortage? I will of course bring enough masks with me from home to use the first few days, but I would rather not bring a truck load."
"They are currently rather easy to find in pharmacies at least and in some supermarkets and other stores (sport shops for instance). I don't know if it will change since they are now mandatory in a lot of places. I know it's not easy when you travel but I am forever grateful to anyone who favors reusable, washable masks over the disposable ones (especially since people seem to think that ""disposable"" means that you can throw them anywhere, preferably in the street)."
"You can find masks absolutely everywhere now in France -- supermarkets, newsstands, many small shops..."
"Thanks for your replies. Good to know masks are readily available right now.I myself prefer to use reusable masks too, it’s what I use at home. However I will be camping in a tent so I don’t know if I’ll be able to wash them properly enough to use them again safely. I will look into that some more to see if a handwash is even recommended and if so, how I would need to do that."
"According to Johns Hopikins Hospital in the US, as long as you have access to hot, soapy water, you should be able to handwash your masks without issue: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/condi…The key is to have soap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LKVUarhtvE"
"I can bring soap/detergent and I will have access to hot water, so I will bring my reusable masks and maybe buy some reusable mask in France as a souvenir:-)Thanks everyone for your help!"

"So envious of people who are able to enjoy Paris right now, relatively uncrowded... it will be a long time before we are allowed to leave our island, and it stings even more France/EU has us on their green list.... be grateful, those that can go, and respect the local rules. If you can’t or won’t respect the rules, don’t go. Go when it’s settled down again...There’s thousands of us who’d love to be in your shoes right now."
We should all be polite to one another. We don’t know how this situation affect each person mentally and physically. In my Country we did a very strict quarantine and now we are almost free of covid . We didn’t wear mask and we still don’t. It’s “mandatory” to all employees but most of them including me we are not wearing masks . We wash our hands regularly. That’s it . On the other hand if we come to Paris in August i will wear a mask and respect the citizens of France . It’s so simple . Respect and understanding.
MelinaEnjoy your August visit.I have now received a visor and it is comfortable . Hopefully it will be acceptable.Keep well allAnthony K
Hope you are well my friend and i wish you can go in September and enjoy your stay ♥️
Just heard on the radio that the visor is not an acceptable substitute to the mask. If you sneeze or talk the droplets can still diffuse. An acceptable face covering should cover the nose and mouth.
"SophSadly, I have discovered that you are 100% correct. The visor is not the answer.However the generosity of some people knows no boundaries. Having discussed this situation, on Twitter, a wonderful lady, in The Netherlands, has sent me a boxful of fabric masks, that she has made herself, for people with breathing difficulties. They have very fine stitching and air filters interwoven, and I have been wearing one for an hour now and whilst my face is warmer than usual I have no other ill effects. It is a miracle!I belief that life throws us an oval ball from time to time and we have to adjust our game playing. Every challenge can be overcomeI couldn't be happier.Keep wellAnthony K"
So along with the ones your doctor has prescribed for you then you should be good to go.
"Anthony, bienvenue à Paris! Those masks sound like heaven. I wish I had one..)"
"I am, now, looking forward to my visit. It cannot come too soon.The history of French Renaissance Art and the following of Impressionism and Modernism is not shown anywhere as wonderfully as it is shown in Paris.I am also, once again, looking forward to the hospitality and welcome of Parisians. Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 9:57 am, July 21, 2020 "
"Yes as I (and others) have said, there are many models and sizes of masks so it's worth shopping around to find one for you (there is one for you out there). I tried several models and the ones that I liked best I also found on Etsy (washable, 3 layers of cotton, with adjustable straps). Glad that Anthony found some that suits him. There was no need to invoke Nazi dictatorship."
SophThank-you. Believe me no-one is happier than I am right now.I hope everyone has the success that I have had ... if at first you don't succeed ... try and keep on trying...Keep wellAnthony K
"No such thing as ""Back to Normal after COVID."" It doesn't exist today, nor will it exist next year or the next 20 years. All of us need to adjust to the ""new normal"" across the planet moving forward."
"I am not that pessimistic personally. I was in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic and everything seemed extremely abnormal. A year later, things were back to normal.And of course a hundred years ago, there was the Spanish flu which was much worse than covid and killed many more people during a two year period. And life got back to normal after that. Why would this be different?"
"Some people are slow learners, kerouac2."
"""Masks don't make much difference"". Oh dear. There has been a volte face on this. That was a view shared some time ago, particularly when it wasn't appreciated how asymptomatic and presymptomatic people can unknowingly spread the disease. The ""quite clever people"" at these institutions hold the view that masks do make a difference and can help save lives. MIT MedicalMayo ClinicUCSF MedicalUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge and countless others around the world with active research on the subject, includingLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Look at how Germany handled things compared to the UK. Masks were made compulsory in most areas there over three months ago. I do sympathise with people who find masks uncomfortable and distressing. I don't like them myself (especially when it's hot like today) but I'll continue to wear one until there is a proven vaccine or other ""end"" in sight."
"As we move out of the Covid19 threat, hopefully sooner rather than later, we will, before any vaccine is determined, tested and distributed, move into Autumn, and on into Winter, and the Flu-seasons, once again.As a result of restrictions put in place, in many countries, recently, I have a feeling that ""facemask"" wearing will become the norm, for a sizeable percentage of the World's population, whether it is mandatory or not.As 1 metre and 2 metre ""social distancing"" disappear entirely ... then casual contact, outside of the home, may become the normal activity of masked men and women.Keep well all.Anthony K"
Some people are alarmists.
"Most people are excited by extreme and exaggerated things, especially if they are scary. Thus, stories about doom-and-gloom ""new normal"" appeal to them, and can become self-fulfilling prophecies.The new indoor mask fiasco in France may entail the manufacture and disposal of some 100 million masks each day. This represents a new expenditure of around €228 per month per family. The masks are not sterile or airtight or capable of stopping viruses, and are not disposed of as biohazardous material. They provide an illusion of security and a warm and fuzzy sense of community, but scientifically they are not significant barriers to disease transmission. There is no consensus on their effectiveness, opinions of alleged experts reverse and conflict regularly, and the methodology of some of the so-called studies done on the topic leaves much to be desired. For these and other reasons, I question how long the use of masks will remain tenable—although sometimes peer pressure and approval simply override all other considerations, particularly during periods of hysteria."
"""The masks are not sterile or airtight or capable of stopping viruses, and are not disposed of as biohazardous material."" --> This sentence contains two straw men and a red herring. No serious scientist or public health official has claimed that the face masks used by the general public are sterile or airtight. No serious scientist or public official has claimed that face masks are « capable of stopping viruses »; the only claim has been that face masks can contain droplets that may house virus particles. There is no suggestion that face masks should be disposed of as bioharzardous material because it is not currently thought that surface transmission presents a large risk. ""but scientifically they are not significant barriers to disease transmission."" --> when combined with other measures, it is thought that face masks are an effective tool in preventing the spread of Covid-19. See: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext and https:/…""There is no consensus on their effectiveness"" --> technically true, but irrelevant. ""opinions of alleged experts reverse and conflict regularly"" --> that's how science works. ""the methodology of some of the so-called studies done on the topic leaves much to be desired."" --> a rather non-specific claim.Edited: 12:49 am, July 23, 2020 "

"Well, that is certainly some interesting information... about 5 months out of date."
122 - the words are there but the logic isn't. I get it: it's easier to argue against a bogeyman that you've constructed rather than the actual arguments that scientists and public health officials have set forth. I hope that anyone reading your post has enough sense to recognise it for the nonsense that it is.

"If you're talking about virus n the sewers, that information dates from yesterday, not five months ago, and has been reported by a dozen or so media outlets. Virus in the sewers is not a problem, it just illustrates that there are infected people out there. They must have forgot their masks, eh?People are social animals, and most of them adopt their opinions wholesale from others under peer pressure, or for peer acceptance. It is very unusual for people to reason based on facts. For example, most people will take a celebrity's word for something even in a domain about which the celebrity is entirely ignorant, but will not even bother to look at a research paper written by a non-celebrity scientist, much less evaluate the paper independently. Even peer-reviewed journals sometime make this mistake."
Are you talking about yourself?
"I'm in the category of people who develop opinions based on facts and logic. As a result I do like to examine research papers and other similar sources, and I pay no particular attention to celebrities or demagogues. I prefer being right over being popular."

"Says: ""As a result I do like to examine research papers""Does: links to a newspaper articleDid you perhaps miss the last line? « Mieux vaut donc le [un masque] réserver aux moments les plus pertinents : transports publics, espaces clos, etc. »"
"It's precisely because there are people who are currently infected (and maybe without knowing it) that it is a good idea to wear masks, as it lowers the risks of those people infecting others. It's not 100% foolproof, nothing is, but it helps."
"There has been covid in waste water in France since March, and also in the secondary water system in Paris which is used for washing the streets and running the decorative fountains. For this reason, in Paris the fountains have not been running since March and the streets are being washed with drinking water."

"The ""experts"" have said that air conditioning is one of the very worst things for spreading the covid virus. I know that our manic is a very strong supporter of air conditioning, so I would be interested in learning his current views on the subject."
"Covid is much more than a nasty flu. People who are sick may not know they are sick, and may be infectious before they develop symptoms. People have been wearing masks during the previous SARS and MERS epidemics (here is a random reference for assessment of their efficiency : https:/… , or the introduction of this paper with other references within : https:/… ). And maybe we should actually wear masks to prevent the transmission of the common flu (although for this one we have a partially effective vaccine solution)."
"Air conditioning is a broad term, so it is difficult to make generalizations. Air circulation is good if it moves viruses away from you, and bad if it moves viruses towards you. Air conditioning that forces air through HEPA filters (as most central A/C systems and some others do) removes viruses from the air flow and is thus good; this is why hospital operating rooms and bio-safety labs are air-conditioned, even in France, and also applies to airliner ventilation systems, many home systems, and others. This is also why A/C is often recommended for pollen allergies. The ""experts"" are often clueless individuals who are totally unfamiliar with air conditioning and rely mainly on superstition. This is common in cool climates. I long ago noticed that people in the south of France are far less superstitious about A/C than those in the north."
"Good to know that the world is full of clueless experts. It's amazing all these clueless experts were able to invent things like electricity, cars, planes, rockets, satellites, vaccines etc., etc. Here is some info easily found on the internet about the coronavirus from the clueless experts at Johns Hopkins and the CDC. Of course, if you can't rely on clueless experts nor celebrities for you info I guess that leaves only one worldwide expert on the coronavirus:Q: Does wearing a mask prevent transmission of the coronavirus?A: (Johns Hopkins, which includes answers to many other commonly asked questions about the virus):https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/condi…Q: Is the coronavirus more serious than normal flu strains?A: https:/…coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-fluhttps:/…flu-vs-covid19.htmEdited: 1:44 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Edit: My first question should have read ""Does wearing a mask ""HELP IN PREVENTING"" transmission of the coronavirus?"
"""Clueless experts"" invented air conditioning. Of course, the term ""clueless expert"" is an oxymoron."
"For me masks in public places are only a minor factor.. The vast majority of transmissions occur during close and prolonged contacts with family, friends, colleagues, without mask.The insistence of the authorities and even experts about masks also serves to hide their inability to control the situation.Edited: 2:01 pm, July 23, 2020 "
But he said they relied mainly on superstition. That explains everything!
"The experts aren't trying to hide anything and openly admit there is much they don't know about the virus. Hence, the reason there is not yet a vaccine. But they universally agree that wearing a mask in confined, indoor spaces (especially if such an indoor space doesn't allow for distancing) is the simplest and best solution at present to prevent transmission. I'll choose to rely on the best science available at present rather than armchair opinions from people not directly involved with scientific research on the topic."
"But have you considered yet the opinions of celebrities? After all, that's the only way we can truly form our opinions. Edit: sarcasmEdited: 2:14 pm, July 23, 2020 "
Please provide facts to support your assumptions.
"I haven't seen any scientific study showing statistics or even a large number of personal experiences, of large numbers of people who have been infected in public places because of the absence of masks. Since authorities (well, not in all countries, not in Switzerland or the Netherlands, where you don't see any mask except on public transport) and experts are so obsessed about masks, I'm sure they would present such studies over and over. So my conclusion: there is zero proof many transmissions are due to the absence of masks nonpublic spaces."
Please do your own research. You may be surprised.
"But yes, masks in public spaces may prevent 1%, 2% ...maybe 5% of the trsnsmissions."
"And why does 5% suddenly matter, for a disease with mortality of 0.5%?"
"""Please do your own research."" Translation: I don't know what I'm talking about, so I need to send you on a goose chase. I'm going to go out on a limb here and posit that you've never taken a course in statistics or research methods."
"I already clearly stated what experts have to say about masks in indoor spaces. I don't know what you're on about in regards to masks in outdoor spaces since the experts have said they're unnecessary in outdoor spaces except in large crowd gatherings where distancing is not possible. To our resident denier - I've done the research and posted links from the ""expert resources."" You have refused to do so and when presented with evidence and asked to respond to said evidence you instead take a different tack and attempt to steer the debate in another direction.

If anyone wants to appear knowledgeable when quoting statistics then they best back up up their quotes/stats with sourced info from credible sources.
"""I haven't seen any scientific study showing statistics or even a large number of personal experiences, of large numbers of people who have been infected in public places because of the absence of masks.""You haven't been using google to its fullest potential. here is just one of many examples (you can google for others):https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/corona…If you're still on about outdoor spaces I've addressed that issue twice. If that's the case then why do you keep bringing the outdoor space issue up when it's twice been addressed and answered? You might want to look at the daily number of new cases in Florida over the last few weeks. They decided to open early and people packed the beaches. Because they refuse to do contact tracing in that state it's difficult to specifically state that opening early and people packing the beaches was a cause for recent explosion in new numbers of daily cases but when you compare the Florida situation to other places in the U.S. that didn't open early and encouraged people not to gather in masses (indoors or outdoors) it presents a pretty compelling case that Florida got it wrong because many states that encouraged distancing/masks/no public gatherings and adhering to guidelines on opening are doing a far better job at controlling new cases."
"We will not convince Euromanic or Pierre W, so the best thing is just to ignore everything that they say."
"In 131 I posted a link to an article in Le Parisien about cities that are ordering masks outdoors and the potential legality of same. That was the reason for my several references to it.A ""compelling case"" and scientific proof of cause and effect are not synonymous. The former may simply be speculation. I should think and hope that issuing commandments to the public would be based upon the latter, but in times of hysteria this may not be the case, and indeed it’s possible that no justification will be offered at all."
"Google ""coronavirus statistics per capita europe"" and you'll see the Netherlands (number 19) and Switzerland (number 16) are trailing France (number 23) in per capita rates (out of a total of 46 country results). The ""no preventive measures"" tactic chosen by Sweden (number 3) didn't work out too well for them."
"Now for the third time someone is posting about masks outdoors. I refuse, for a third time, to have to address this issue that has already been covered. In words already used in this thread, ""do your own research.""Edited: 4:07 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Euromanic - Please explain to all of us why ""you think"" there might be a difference in per capita cases in Sweden (no preventive measures taken) vs. its neighbors Denmark, Norway and Finland (preventive measures taken). And then do the same for Florida vs. Massachusetts.You contradict yourself because you say you rely on science but science relies on theories and when science has no absolute factual evidence it relies on the best available evidence to draw conclusions (leaving the door open to the fact that new evidence may be presented on which to base better theories). So your ""compelling evidence"" argument is null and void, not only based on how science works but based on your prior statements. If your shovel isn't big enough to continue digging the hole you're standing in I can lend you a larger shovel."
"There isn’t enough data, and too many variables, to draw any useful conclusions, so I have not done so."
That's an excellent non-answer and a great way to avoid answering the numerous questions posed to you that discredit your personal conclusions.
"Look, I disagree with you most of the time when you comment on the coronavirus, air conditioning and climate change but I actually don't revel in combatting you on these issues. I just disagree with you on these issues and can't remain silent (much like you can't). But I almost always otherwise agree with you when you post on other topics and quite enjoy your posts so don't take anything I say personally. I do, in fact, enjoy reading your commentary on other topics not associated with these 3 issues."
"Surely rants like this belong in a half empty stadium in Tulsa. With people who have ""done their research"" right? Euromanic tells us that it's plausible to wear a mask when one is sick ""but there is no reason for people who are not sick to wear a mask."" I wonder where asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers of Covid fit into this piece of well researched advice. We are all entitled to an opinion and if it's about ""which is better; Paris or London?"" Fine. But this different. Luckily I doubt anyone is looking at those posts and saying ""mmmm you know what? I think s/he knows more than those pesky scientists."" You say you would rather be right than popular. I would rather live and get a side-bonus of not killing others."
"True enough LLS but really this is a travel forum, not someplace where people should be seeking scientific answers about covid-19, so hopefully enlightened people will search elsewhere with relevant sources to gain knowledge about the virus. Mr. Manic has a few odd hang-ups (3, to be precise) but otherwise has a lot of useful input that I've read throughout the years on this forum. But...as a DE, and in light of the global pandemic we are now faced with, this is no time to cut anyone some slack (especially a DE) when their comments are not only not backed up by any science but are hurtful to folks who have loved ones who are suffering from the virus, or who have died as a result of virus related issues."
"Well, I was just about to cut Euromanic some slack but since they said the virus is not in the least deadly then that olive branch is off the table. What is wrong with you Euromanic? The stats are there (if you want to do your own research) to prove that this virus is not the same as the normal yearly flu viruses. You seem to want to double down on your stupidity."
Wrong. Read the links I provided from Johns Hopkins and WHO. Of course you'll refuse to do so nor will you provide links to sources for any of the stats you post. Debunking your arguments is like shooting fish in a barrel. You should stop behaving like a fish.
I reach conclusions based on the data I see—why would I reach any other conclusions?
"No, mortality was not nearly 100% during the plague (whichever of the several plagues you are referencing). Some people recovered from it and others didn't catch it, despite being in close proximity to those with it."
You have cited zero credible sources. You have a problem. You should get back into your flight simulator. At least there when there is a simulated problem at altitude involving depressurization you won't require a real mask.
You're not reading what I wrote. Do you your research the same way?
"No, I don't research the same way. I read and cite scientifically accredited sources. I don't fixate on a personal belief and try to prove my opinions by doing backflips to cobble together an argument by cherrypicking data from random sources without citing said sources.Edited: 8:31 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"I have a photocopier that can read and cite. I personally go beyond that in order to evaluate and understand.I mention this because, if your research is as severely lacking in rigor as is your reading of my posts (and I can only suppose it is), it might explain why your conclusions are so dramatically different from those I reach in examining what is presumably similar data."
"""I have a photocopier that can read and cite.""What?"
You have cited no data and have refused to do so when asked. You've done nothing but given your opinions. Now you're telling me to thoroughly examine your statements when you have refused to do the same when I asked you. Unless you say something outrageous I'll go ahead and let you have the last word because I honestly take no pleasure in publicly humiliating you.
"Actually, I have provided numbers, although I recommend that anyone with a keen interest look them up. There is no consensus for almost all the numbers so one must investigate to get a clear picture. There is no such thing as Scientific Accreditation, so there is no point in looking for that. The reality is much blurrier than the sensationalized sound bites broadcast by popular media imply. I do note that the gloomier the viewpoint of a source, the more airtime it is likely to receive."
"Useless non-information, a bunch of nonsense, no cited sources to any of the stats you cherrypicked but at least you didn't repeat that this is a non-deadly virus (because even the seasonal flu, for which we have vaccines, is deadly)."
"I wear a seatbelt in an automobile, many cars are equiped with airbags and it's forbidden in most countries to drink and drive. Do you think we should abandon those measures since they have not completely eradicated deadly car accidents?"
"The utility of seat belts and such have been strongly supported by extensive research and experiment. The utility of masks has not. And people are not required to wear helmets or fire-retardant suits in their cars, nor install roll bars in them, nor drive at less than 10 mph, because the cost/benefit does not justify them."
"Consider the health of others ...Could we agree to overlook the medical and scientific pros and cons of ""face mask"" wearing and simply settle for - ""Just wear a mask."" No ifs no buts, unless you have a specific medical exemption, cover your nose and mouth with a ""comfortable"" fabric, disposable or reusable..It may not be the answer to the scourge but, when indoors and in close proximity to other people, for the next few weeks or months, is it such an imposition?I am delighted to have found a set of washable, thus reusable, masks that I can wear.In London now, on Public Transport, in all Retail outlets, Museums and Galleries, where requested, I am happy to comply.Keep well all Anthony K"
"Garden girlInteresting comment. On the BA website, updated today, they say ""on board"" with respect to face masks - ""We require you to wear a face mask at all times. As a guide they last up to four hours, so bring enough for the duration of your trip.""This is accompanied by a picture of a flight attendant wearing a disposable ""surgical"" mask.Could it be that their expectation is also for ""surgical"" masks to be worn.Anthony K"
Most people wear those disposable masks longer than 4 hours and/or reuse them. Anyway fow income families can't afford to buy that many masks.The authorities are unable to check how long you wear a disposable mask or whether you wash the reusable masks. You are personally responsible of what you decide to do.
"PierreI understand what you say. However, I would hate to be turned away at my outbound Airport because my chosen Airline stipulated a ""mask"" that I did not have or could not comfortably wear.Anthony K  PS - When I say ""comfortably"", I mean where their stipulated masks would cause me severe breathing difficulties."
"Garden girlFor fear of taking this thread off-topic, badly, and introducing nothing to do with Paris, I hope that I can answer your most recent post with a PM.ThanksAnthony K"
"Wow... all I wanted to know was how 'normal' Paris was to visit now, and what restrictions a reasonable person might take.Instead I get a load of self proclaimed 'experts (on both sides) at each others throats over the morbidity rates and the efficacy of masks. 196 replies at this point and about 5 of them answer the question, the rest are keyboard warriors hijacking the thread and ruining it for people who just want a straightforward answer to a question. Tiresome"
"Glad I read the comment about AirFrance - hadn't even thought to check and had ordered reusable material masks. Will get some surgical style for our flight in 2 weeks, can I just clarify is the material style acceptable on public transport in Paris and entering shops and restaurants etc. or do we need surgical style for those too?Thanks"
I believe that Air France provides masks to passengers who don't have the correct one.There are no rules about the type of masks for public transport and indoor activity. You will see a number of maskless scofflaws in any case but luckily not too many.
British Airways are accepting fabric masks on-board their flights.Anthony K
What a pity.
"All everyone!Masks put aside (I carry the same cheap one in my pocket to comply with the silly rules in the metro or in the shops) I have spent a rather enjoyable day in Paris today.My local market was as normal as it can be, with no social distancing whatsoever.In the Marais, the terrasses in the rue de Bretagne/carreau du temple area were packed and joyful. In the rue des francs bourgeois the shops are open. Staff are all wearing masks, making them very difficult to understand sometimes. In St Germain des pres it was a bit more quiet, as it usually is on Sundays. We had diner outside, the weather was glorious, it was lovely.I highly recommend coming to Paris this summer."
"General waste, my own observations are the same as yours. Many people behaving recklessly and not keeping distance in even the slightest way. Unsurprised to see cases rising rapidly."
"General - ""with no social distancing whatsoever"" you recommend a visit to Paris. I could be wrong but I'm going to assume a soupçon of sarcasm there."

"Only utter arrogance would refer to the dangers of the worst pandemic the modern world has seen as scaremongering. Statements like that tell you all you need to know. People who dismiss this virus in this selfish manner should sit down with the families of victims (and ICU staff working themselves to exhaustion whilst their colleagues die) and tell them to their faces that there is no danger at all, it is just scaremongering."

"Good to hear that thommo, if you can't hit their conscience (because it doesn't exist) then hit their pockets."
"Save it for the reader mail column of your favourite tabloid, offalyranger15."
"I don't read tabloids, but I do listen to the advice of public health professionals, scientists and doctors. I certainly don't listen to arrogant and selfish people like you and your compatriot Dominic Cummings."
"Trying to compare the fact that the Spanish flu killed 20 million people to the fact that covid has ""only"" killed 650,000 so far would imply that you think that there has been absolutely no medical progress in the last 100 years. How many respirators did they have 100 years ago? Or any of the other modern equipment or drugs?"
"k2I'm not suggesting anything. But let's not overexaggerate the current dangers, when you compare current cases to current deaths.Keep wellAnthony K"
ThommoScotland Yes ! Test must be done prior but not need to quarantine. But.. Oh my god are the tests so expensive in the UK ? Here it’s 60€ .
Absolutely brilliant answer Kerouac. My daughter is a nurse who does COVID testing at the clinic where she works. We live in Texas and have been hit hard by COVID. I know people who have had it and been ok after a few days. I know people who have had to be hospitalized and almost died. And now I know a former coworker who has died from it. The real issue is this virus is highly contagious and when you get it you don’t know whether you will be lucky and only get sick or unlucky and die. So who wants to roll the dice with their life because “it’s not as bad as they say”?
"** I don't think it is sarcasm, I think there are many irresponsible people planning visits to Paris irrespective of the pandemic. **I don't believe they are irresponsible people. These are wonderful people who are chock full of mettle, trying to help COVID to metastasize through Paris and later in their own community at home. It must be lovely to be so myopic about the repercussions of the virus at this stage, but we should wish them well and hope they don't end up moribund at some overcrowded ICU."
"The WHO itself states that border closures and travel restrictions are not effective to fight the virus in the long term, except for small countries that have almost zero cases.https:/…"
Tests are free of charge in the UK and as often as you need. You can do them at a drive in centre or by courier if unable to drive. Results in less than 48 hours. It took the government long enough to get around to it but it works quite well now.
"@224The WHO may have correct assessments on border restriction and travel ban, without any ad hominem to them, they also have mischaracterized issues in the recent past. The crux is that medical pundits and experts do not have a clear understanding of this malady yet."
"AS we have seen on the PGA tour in America, a test only indicates what your Covid status was at the time of the test, nothing else. People can have a test and subsequently pick up a the virus at the airports and public transport they travel in. Golfers and athletes are operating with regular testing and supposedly in pods but even some of them are getting the virus. It is arrogant and selfish to be advocating travel at this time."
"Well everyone is selfish ! It is just as selfish to discourage the travel of others to protect your own health. The general interest, the common good and the like, I don't believe at all in those concepts. People defend their own interest and those of their groupEdited: 7:50 am, July 28, 2020 "
Discouraging travel protects everybody's health not just your own.
Travel broadens the mind. Discouraging travel will lead to the death of the travel industry. Nobody wants to live in a bubble. Keep well allAnthony K
"Pierre, that is utter nonsense. We have to have the notion of common good in society or it can't function. Imagine you have a child in school, would you be happy that a selfish parent would send their child to school with a highly infectious and dangerous disease (not necessarily Covid) and have him/her sitting beside your child and sharing school equipment whilst coughing and sneezing? I'd imagine you'd be the one dressing up as a woman on a sinking ship if it was decided that women and children should be first to be put onto lifeboats."
"Anthony, you don't have to live in a bubble, you can travel in your own county until this pandemic is controlled."
Britain cannot fill all my cultural needs. I am a Europhile who needs his annual fix of the best that the European mainland has to offer. Also I do not know how many years I have left.Keep wellAnthony K
So personal cultural needs come before the health and safety of everybody else during a pandemic. None of us know how many years we have left.
"Not at all. I value my health, such as it is, and the health of my family above all other considerations. I am as vigilant about my hygiene when away from my home as I am when in my home.The threat of Covid19 has robbed me of twelve weeks of my life.I will obviously be guided by Health and Science Professionals, but I am unlikely to be swayed by ""uncaring"" politicians and amateurs on TA Forums.It is my least intention to put anyone else at risk of anything negative when I liaise with strangers.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Waiting for the right time might never happen. In the U.S. this was going to be a two-week pause to help ""bend the curve"". The idea was to keep our hospitals from being overrun. Our hospitals never became overrun. In New York City a military hospital ship was sent to help ease the burden - it never had a single patient before it was reassigned. Now the definition has been changed and, months later, we're still waiting for permission to live our lives. We wear masks and social distance but are told there are many more cases (always somewhere else but the mask order/closures are here too). As far as I'm concerned, if you can travel, travel. If you have comorbidities that make your risk especially high, take every precaution to protect yourself. If you get sick, stay out of the public until you recover. Most healthy people aren't going to have serious symptoms. Young healthy people have a roughly zero percent chance of serious symptoms. If you don't have COVID, chances are 100 percent you won't give it to someone else. Living in fear is a poor alternative to living."
"I don't know in the US, ..., but here in Belgium, and its also true in France, nothing,has been done in favour of the young, 12 to 25, since the begin of the pandemic. Billions have been distributed to various groups, but for the young, nothing, zero, no gesture, the authorities don't even talk to this group. They are purely victims of the lockdown and the chosen politics, as their own health is not threatened..That's particularly true for the poorer ones, between 16 and 25. So if they don't adher to the rules and don't respect any, it is just logical, 100% normal.Edited: 9:14 am, July 28, 2020 "
Yes 100% normal for kids who have been brought up by their parents to respect nobody. Their health mightn't be threatened but if they are carrying the virus they can infect others who are more vulnerable. More excuses for ignorant and selfish people.
"Anthony, our scientists and medical professionals here in Ireland have told us to stay at home and avoid foreign travel, but I guess you know more then them."
than them ... and no I do not.Anthony K
'Then' was a typo...so you know less than them but you still travel despite their expert advice.
"It's funny how the average age of patients is plummeting every day (and not just young people without symptoms but also the ones in hospital). I guess they fully bought into the idea being propagated by many that they have no risk at all, just maybe a case of the sniffles at most. That explains all of the wild parties followed by all of the sick people afterwards, especially the ones who are killing their parents and grandparents when they go home. No problem -- we're all here to have fun and nothing else matters.Meanwhile the title of this thread is getting sillier and sillier every day: << Back to “normal” after Covid19? >> There is absolutely nothing ""normal"" about this discussion or people would be trading restaurant addresses and new museums and attractions to visit."
Re 243 ... I am not in Ireland.Anthony K
"People like Anthony and Pierre don't care about this, their travel needs and other needs take precedence. Their attitude is very clear to me and no amount of superfluous and patronising waffle will hide it."
"I thought that the US had a monopoly on selfish people who want to do what they want to do, no matter what the consequences to others. But I see here that Belgium and the UK have such people also."
"I had a tiny trip planned taking me through a piece of Belgium and Luxembourg, but I have also understood that it would not be wise at the moment, as the first little ripples of the second wave seem to be lapping at the shores of Spain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. Belgium is already on the orange list of numerous countries and Luxembourg is even on the red list for countries like Switzerland."
"Gardengirlie, well said. We can guess who tried to have this thread removed. You have articulated the responsible and unselfish thing to do very well. We are lucky the majority aren't like our friends for whom Britain cannot fill all of their cultural needs and deem strolling around museums as essential travel. We must also not forget our Europhiles who need their annual fix of the best that the European mainland has to offer. Their needs come before the health and safety of everyone. If some people end up in ICU for months it is a small price to pay for cultural enrichment."
"So many opinions all unrelated to the topic / questions I asked. If someone wants to hear, learn about covid19 they can enter other sites related to medical suspects . This is Tripadvisor. We get advices about our travels . I know not everyone accepts that some people need/want to travel but it’s our decision and don’t forget also our governments . And when i say governments i mean also the doctors experts that they hire to do the job .It’s so simple . Respect and be kind ."
"#246, #247 Actually, you don't know me, your accusations are worthless. If everyone would live like me, the virus would not spread. Like my holidays are mostly hiking alone far from the crowds.And I'm 63, I just wrote a post #239 in favor of the 16 - 25. That's unselfish.And, certainly, you are arrogant.Edited: 12:38 am, July 29, 2020 "

"I don't know your age, but yes our generations, the 50+, even more the 60+, even more the 70+, have behave in a selfish way since the end of the 1970s, and that's even worse with the virus now.Basically, if we all die from the virus, that's exactly what we deserve.And sorry Anthony if some attack me personally in TA and in this discussion I have the right to answer.Edited: 2:28 am, July 29, 2020 "
"And now I agree TA should close this discussion, and even delete it entirely from TA."
"Been to tourist destinations all week and they have all been packed solid with many many accents heard.Everyone is obeying the guidelines, even the British tourists I have encountered. It's back to normal, with guidelines.About to take a swim in Lake Annecy without my mask..)"
"I have just come back from a stroll through Barbizon and the Foret de Fontainebleau. Social distancing virtually nill, hardly any masks worn unless actually in a shop. Many people, particularly shop and restaurant staff, wearing masks under their noses, totally pointless. In my village no sign of a mask on anyone at any time other than on the guy who drives the pizza van. People look at me like I'm a maniac for wearing one.I was in the butchers in a nearby town yesterday and a lady came in with no mask to enquire whether they were still requiring customers to wear them, she was told yes, at which point she rooted about in her bag to find a mask to put on.The cafe on the square is open air but tables are still packed close together, less space than I would like, obviously no masks on any customers."
"On the contrary here in the mountains people are obeying the rules. Our little supermarket has masks available at the entrance for 1 euro if you forget yours. Everybody wears them inside. The restaurants, bars and cafes have distancing. People will get too close if passing but we just get out of the way. I forgot mine when I wanted to take an open standing ski lift and would never have been closer than 2 metres from anybody but the attendant kindly just gave me one. So I really do not think people can generalise."
"Hello FatChris!Wearing a mask under the nose isn't pointless. The purpose of a mask is to block micro droplets when you cough, sneeze or talk. When you're breathing normaly, the only things coming out from your nose are gazes, and the virus cannot be carried away by gazes.So unless you sneeze, it's wearing a mask over your nose that is actually pointless (and very uncomfortable!)."
"Naked noses suck up the virus, so it's just the difference in purpose. The masks are meant to prevent us from spreading the virus, but if you want to obtain it instead, leaving your nose exposed is the best way to do it."
"There are people wearing a mask in a bid to avoid falling ill? Aww, that's cute! :-)"

"Post #261 notes ""gazes"" coming out of one's nose. ""gasses"" perhaps? What constitutes the emissions from a moist environment like your nose? Yes, some carbon dioxide. But also some microscopic moisture particles. Quite large enough to carry a virus which is so small it can only be visualised with an electron microscope. You can discern the moisture content by holding a mirror under your nose and breathing through your nose onto it. It's not high science, but it is an observable phenomenon.So an uncovered nose can distribute moisture than can be a carrier for all manner of viruses.To be fully effective, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth. It is far more comfortable than an endotracheal intubation."
"What you observe by holding a mirror under your nose is condensation, i.e. gas (in that case water vapour) turning liquid when it hits the colder surface."
"** the only things coming out from your nose are gazes **@261Certainly, an intriguing observation with a good chance of defining the next Hollywood SCIFI plot“The nostrils gaze” covering the grand marquee of the major movie theaters. Buoyed by the excitement of being part of the cast, I scurried to the mirror to gaze at my nasal gaze, only to find out that mine only exhausts air (story of my life)."
** mine only exhausts air **Hopefully not ^^
"""gazes"" come out of my, unmasked, eyes.Anthony K"
Out of curiosity I went back to the original post to see how all these latest posts relate to it. The answer -- they don't.
"@General_wasteBy the way, the point you‘re making about the facemask in #261, is correct, however, the part that’s dissembled in all the discourse of this thread, is the menace of the aerosolized microdroplets (which you somewhat referenced in #261). Purportedly, the experts (virologists, epidemiologists, etc.) advise that the droplets can linger in midair for up to 72 hours (even saw a video made by Chinese researcher using inferred imaging devices indicating the possibility of up to 96 hours), so if there is a morsel of truth to this putative conclusion, then individuals without the facemask could potentially remain vulnerable to the droplets in public spaces."
