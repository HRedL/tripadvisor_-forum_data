"This might be the wrong place to ask..... but I flew into Canada for a wedding on the 10th of March, I was supposed to fly back tomorrow the 20th, I called the airline to check if that flight was going ahead, but they’ve told me that due to Covid-19 I can’t fly for 14 days (recommended isolation period) from arrival from Europe, so until the 24th, I’m worried the UK will close its borders by then (i live there on a working holiday visa, but I’m from Australia). I’ve searched everywhere to see if it’s true I can’t fly, the 14 day isolation is only a recommendation, I’d like to fly tomorrow? Anyone have any useful info? I am also very aware that I should be distanced from people, and I have planned for the flight to protect myself/my spread while travelling, I’d just like to get home."
