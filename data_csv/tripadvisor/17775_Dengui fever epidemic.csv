"Hi my husband has just read on line that there is a dengue fever epidemic in Singapore at the moment. I am a bit worried as we are a real target for mosquitoes wherever we go! We are coming in July, should we be concerned?"
"nikki2007England, hello..If you or your husband read smth like this;businessweek.com/news/2013-05-07/singapore-b…http://www.dengue.gov.sg/The bEST prevention is still DEEO or AUTAN, nothing saves a human being better than a simple ( although) sticky) lotion.IMO dengue is MORE an issue in Indonesia where ( to tell the truth) none cares to fight and pay attention."
As a tourist you are unlikely to GST any areas were there may be mosies ( may be the Night Safari but even there a lot eradication effort has taken place). Keep away from farm rain forested an remote areas and you should be fine. Add you favourite repellant as additional protection.
"please READ: <<is still DEET or AUTAN,>>"
"I am usually very attractive to Mosquitos (ie I get bitten all over). However, in over 10 trips to Singapore I have only been bitten once.Don't worry about dengue fever - I have been in Singapore on lots of occasions when it is being reported on in the paper but it has always been in areas which I wouldn't normally be visiting.Juliet"
Hi everyone. Thanks so much for your help and advice. I won't worry anymore but I will buy some repellant!
"Also, please note that the vector for dengue fever is a day biting mosquito and is found in areas with stagnant water. Just for everybody's awareness..."
"take some precaution when you come. If not, then just go to the local pharmacy to buy mosquito patches and paste it on your clothes or bag. that would last for few to several hours. You can find Pharmacy in almost every shopping mall/centre, very convenient. Various types are available, you can even get the spray type. My family live in one of the hottest spot of the outbreak, for the very 1st time, it had hit the main news headline, but we all need to do our part to avoid making the situation more serious. Most of these hot spot are located in the heartland where local live."
"We were in Singapore last week - saw the advertising signs regarding Dengue plus some stuff about it in the newspapers. We were in both the 'city area' and the Changi Village Area and saw more signs about it in the CVA. Best thing is to take the precautions for not getting bitten - that is put on repellant particually in the daylight hours as this is when the dengue mozzie is active and wear long loose clothing to also help deter bites. Symptons for Dengue appear 3days to 14days after getting bitten by a mozzie that is carrying the virus. There's no vacine for Dengue and unfortunatlly, Dengue is in most countries that have a tropical climate - we even get Dengue here in Australia. I wouldn't stress too much about getting Dengue in Singapore - just make sure you take some precautions - it's all part and parcel of traveling. Enjoy Singapore - 'she's' beautiful.Here are the symptoms of Dengue (I've cut and pasted from an official Aust. Gov site which advices us aussie's on Dengue) Dengue fever has many symptoms, and people usually experience a combination of symptoms. Common symptoms of dengue fever are: sudden fever and extreme tiredness intense headache (especially behind the eyes) muscle and joint pain loss of appetite vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain a metallic taste in the mouth red or macular (small, flat red spots) rash occurs in half of cases minor bleeding from nose and gums Most symptoms last up to a week and in some cases the fever may return for another 2-3 days. Dengue fever symptoms affect everyone differently. They can range from mild, and can even go unnoticed (often in children), to very severe and potentially fatal. Most people will experience a certain amount of discomfort, regardless of their specific symptoms, and usually need to spend a few days resting at home. This is important, not only for recovery but to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.…qld.gov.au/dengue/treatment/symptoms.asp"
"nikki2007England,you`ll be fine, i`m sure..Travel safely!"
"Flying to and from Singapore is probably a greater risk (mathematically speaking) than catching Dengue fever. The average tourists are most unlikely to be in any areas where significant amounts of stagnant water is found.As our dear friend ''Schonefeld'' writes, ''you'll be fine, I'm sure''. As indeed am I sure, ''you'll be fine''. Enjoy."
"You can get up to date info on dengue cluster locations here (http://www.dengue.gov.sg/subject.asp?id=74). For me, i'm not too worry b'cos there are no clusters near my place. If we hear there are cases, I'm get my repellent out."
