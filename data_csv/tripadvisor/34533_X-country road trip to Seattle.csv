"Timing is everything...long before stuff hit the fan we planned to move to Seattle. Sold place here in FL closing in less than month. Was planning x-country road trip visiting some Natl Parks in Utah, them heading NW to Seattle mid Apr. We have a place leased in Queen Anne and have no choice but to be out of place in FL as of closing. Question, very difficult to get any official info on getting x-country, expect Interstate routes (truckstops will be open as well as hotels) Also expect things to get worse here in FL, restrictions have been very lax. Thinking it might be better to head west. Any expertise/thoughts would be welcome. Thx,."
its all state by stateIn utah the counties around the parks like in Moab and green river have closed all restaurants and hotels.Marriott and Hilton are looking at closing their hotels nationwide/Most areas have only allowed restaurants to stay open for delivery or take out drive thru only.look at driving 10 or 40 then up 99 and 5 and find what will be open
"Agree with all that Dan said.State border closures not likely - but not out of the realm of possibility. I'm sure you're prepared to be rather flexible.The times are #$*&, but this is a beautiful place to live. Welcome (whenever you arrive)!"
Oof. Timing couldn't be worse. When's your Queen Anne lease begin?~ Colleen
Good luck with your move. Yes times are tough and I'm not sure anyone can answer questions about how things will be handled in the future. But Seattle is a wonderful place to live... once you arrive and settle in.
"Although ""Seattle"" figures prominently in the virus news coverage, most if not all of the cases have been in the suburbs. Haven't heard a word about QA.KOA has cabins at many of its RV parks...don't know if they would meet your needs or even if they are available these days.Fast-food places like Mickey D and Wendy have take-out service, so you might be getting your meals at those kinds of places.Edited: 3:25 pm, March 19, 2020 "
I'm spending the winter near Palm Springs and was planning also to drive towards Vegas and up thru Zion and Bryce on the way home. If you find out anything let me know otherwise it will be up I-5 for me as well. Here all the Casinos closed but the hotel rates dropped by half. Hoping hotels stay open but also worried about food.
Many of the big hotels in Las Vegas have closed. Haven't seen anything about hotels being closed here.
"McMenamins are closed, so I’m expecting a few of the higher end chains and independent places to follow suit. For example, I wouldn’t expect KOAs to be readily available. They may not be able to sanitize bathrooms to their satisfaction. At least in high risk areas, I think more shut downs are coming. Hotels can’t be making much money in Seattle (for example) and there’s a lot of pressure from employees to shut down as well.But basic interstate hotels are likely to be open. Your options may just be limited. Also, I think a lot of businesses are prioritizing emergencies or urgent demand over more routine stuff, so you might find life in Seattle initially frustrating.If you have to pay for the lease, there’s no point in staying in Florida. If it weren’t for that, I’d say hunker down and see how things go. Anything could happen in 2 weeks."
"Governor ofcalifornia now has the state ...entirestate in lockdown. This will limit travel to necessity,"
"If I was in your shoes and was determined to go cross country right now I would get into my car today and make the trip as quickly as possible. Stopping and seeing any sights along the way is off the table. A leisurely trip is off the table. IDK when you’re closing, but if you can’t leave until then and that’s more than days away I’d be figuring out you housing situation in FL. In case the trip is impossible. I believe we may be on the brink of a societal phase change, like when water becomes ice. Being able to freely move around may become limited. Too many folks are not taking the limited, voluntary restrictions seriously. For example the beaches in Clearwater. The folks here on Mercer Island encouraging people to get out and support local businesses. This is only going to result in more restrictions and enforcement of restrictions. Like in Italy, NY and San Francisco."
"Thx to all for their responses. Very helpful. Started looking at Plan A, B and C. More than likely will try to make a b-line to Flagstaff area and hunker down there vs staying in FL. Really think the ""wave"" is going to be a west to east path since west coast was hit first and has taken more stringent approaches than FL.Thx again and all the best to everyone."
"I'm not really following your logic, Gary. I take it you have some tie to Flagstaff? But why ""hunker down"" there, rather than head straight to your final destination? I agree with Wheatie to that end. Hit & miss voluntary restrictions are too ineffective. It seems reasonable to assume there will be a step-up.~ Colleen"
"Hello, I would look at the states that have the highest count of cases as off-limits. If you check online at the https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlYou will find really good information. Your travel is necessary because you already had in motion the transition to WA. I agree with those other responses that a leisurely trip is not in the cards at this time. I would also advise that any hotels you make reservations at you do so on the phone person to person. Telling them your situation that way they understand your trip is a necessary trip. They will be more inclined to call you if there is a change in their status. You can still do drive-by visits to the parks that way your drive is a beautiful drive. I hope this helped, and I wish you a safe and nice trip.See you in WA state!Kristi Obeso"
"hi This is from the perspective of someone living in a smaller city of 30,000 where nature is a 15 min drive away. These are to be taken for what they are. It is by no means from an expert in anything but an avid reader looking at way too many news sites and sites like the CDC. 1. I look for gas at pay at the pump locations using a credit card. I have Chlorox (because it is was on the shelves) and towels to wipe down my credit cards if they needed to be handed over to someone. 2. we have tried different hours for going shopping. We found that around 5:30 pm when families are at home for supper we get fewer people in the grocery store. There are still enough essentials but depending on the day some things are gone. OR really early when they open up and they have restocked overnight. 3. We live in a place where there are lots of open spaces and secondary roads with little traffic. We mentioned a few day ago that if we did not drive these roads as often as we do, it would be amazing. Locals often get jaded so depending on your interests lots to see that would be new to you. A lot of the attractions that would have people in close proximity are closing but often the view from the parking lots are still amazing. Public Washrooms that are open are getting harder to find. We like wandering without getting out of the car, so that is still available. 4. for hotels I found a few pages via google of how to wipe down a hotel room when you first walk in. and when staying more then 1 night, not to get the room made up and clean it yourself. 5. for hotels with the free breakfast - avoid eating there unless they have new rules for social distancing and people are not touching stuff. 6 a lot of restaurants are going take out only. 7. I found this neat video about hand washing https:/… the thing it makes you do is wash all over for more then 20 seconds. 8. as for where there are clusters of infections; that changes so quickly that pretty much impossible to track and, they only know after they tested. 9. Now the hardest part of all the recommendations I have seen: keeping you hands off your face. I have been tracking what my behavior is on that one: I get a failing grade, big time. It is really hard. So having plans B etc.. you could still explore on the way there. There is an awful lot of open space in between the hotspots."
"Thx again to the more recent replies to my orig. inquiry. All very helpful. We are still in FL. Rented a condo on the beach for a month (very reasonable and the beach area is closed, so very empty). Will be re-visiting x-country trip in another week or two. Be looking to make a straight line trip to Seattle, Thx again for all the input."
Good to know that you are able to Shelter In Place.
"Thanks for checking in, Gary. Good to hear that you're sticking close to ""home"" for now. I hope when you do get out here, you're able/willing to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. ~ Colleen"
