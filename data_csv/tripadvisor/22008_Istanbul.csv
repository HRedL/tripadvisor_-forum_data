Probably safer than Brisbane.
Are you referring to coronavirus???
Check your government’s travel advisory/ warning and decide for yourself! If you are still concerned then drop your plans.
safe in what respect? I would not let a possible situation stop me from travelling there.
"Yes, probably do."
"No, just personal safety for an elderly Australia couple"
"Thank you, will do."
You'll be ferpectly fine.
"WazzaTraveller, Both Istanbul and Turkey are safe. Have a great time here. You can also read the trip reports by your fellow Australians. cheers,enigma..."
