I love the Titanic story and the history. How was the exhibit?
"It was goose-bumpy. Lots of story, relics, and a large chunk of the ship."
Amazing. I can't recommend it highly enough. If you're interested even remotely you'll love it.
"I agree with all of the above. Some of the best money I've spent in Vegas, and it was under $20 I think. Some of the exhibits just brought tears to my eyes - especially the big piece of the hull and the jewelry."
Solemn and humbling...It is very real when you are in it....I did not smile on the stair case when we were there ...when our photo was taken out of respect for those that perished...It is done with respect and I liked the time I spent there...
Any coupons to be had?
"it was great, personally i found the fake stair case a little cheesey and a bit of a greab for cash, but that is just me, I did however have a few questions in the later part of last year when Melbourne Australia had a Titanic exhibition and most of the very same "" authentic"" titantic items on display, in particular some of the plates which showed the same photos that were on display in vegas. I am sure it is authentic...mostlyThat said though it is a great exhibit, also the bodies , I liked that"
Thanks everyone for your response. Its a definite must see then on our next trip!
"The current 24/7 magazine--the little booklet available in cabs, and kiosks, has a coupon for 5$ off Titanic tickets.You can also print one off the website: 247vegas.com Click on Vegas Values to download the offerings."
They had tickets at Tix4tonite. I think they were about $16. Great exhibit. There's a neat souvenir they have where you can purchase a piece of coal that was from the actual ship
going back in jan and would most def be interested in going to this exhibit where is it?
Luxor mate.
cheers
It's like an epidemic this morning....http://tinyurl.com/3c4olsh
"There are almost always discounted tickets at the tix4tonight kiosks, much cheaper than the $5 off coupon that you will find in most of the free magazines you can pick up in Vegas.It is a fascinating, educational and interesting exhibit that is very much worth seeing."
Lol @ mgg42.
mgg--THAT should be a *sticky*Please make the suggestion on HUMTAB. ;)
I saw the Titanic exhibit when it was at Tropicana and absolutely loved it!!A lot of what you guys have mentioned was not in the one at Tropicana (like the staircase and the coal). Has anyone seen both? Is it different enough from the Trop one that maybe I should think about going again??
