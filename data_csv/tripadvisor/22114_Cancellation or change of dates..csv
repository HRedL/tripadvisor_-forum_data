"Hi,We are due to travel 30th March. I was just wondering if tour operators are within there rights to move the holiday within a couple of days or would have to refund?OTB have not been in touch with me yet but I’m not sure if they’ll just offer me a refund or not.I’m waiting to cancel my holidays in work.Thanks, Ste"
"Hi stevie, sunshine have just emailed me just to say the holiday has been cancelled please do not go to the airport and that’s it. No mention of refunding money or they’ll be in touch and yet at 10pm last night they took my final balance out of account"

"Thanks Clint/Natalina.Natalina, I have just now had the exact same email off OTB."
do not accept or feel forced to accept a change of dates. Just been a health spokesman on news to say they expect a 2nd wave of the virus to reach it's peak in September/October. If you have refund you can pick an alternative date when it's less likely to face a similar scenario to this.
Just cancelled my easyjet flight for 11 april as cant see myself going.Rebook another time with easyjet voucher. :)
"I agree with Katybdundee. If people defer or rebook, their insurance will not cover any future claims on the next trip which are related to Coronavirus. There is also no guarantee that all hotels and airlines will survive. Sadly some will go under and flights will likely be in short supply. Better to have the cash back in your hand imo and wait for the dust to settle, although how long this will take is anyone's guess. Nothing is certain; that's for certain."
