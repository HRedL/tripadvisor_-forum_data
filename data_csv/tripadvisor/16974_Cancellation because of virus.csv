Is anyone else having second thoughts about travelling due to the virus threat?I'm kind of holding off booking anything due to this scare.My wife thinks maybe I'm over thinking it.
"HolaJust arrived home last night. Saw many people at the Vancouver airport wearing those surgical type face masks. At least more than usual..... includes travelers as well as workers. But then again, the percentage of Asians travelling through this airport is pretty high on any given time or day.I did notice that my wife was the only one around us in the airplane, bringing out the sanitizer wipes right away to swab down the seat, armrests, table trays, magazine pouch, air flow control, seatbelt etc.....does it help? Who knows? Probably couldn't hurt, though. I would be inclined to agree with you wife...Cheers"
"I agree with your wife....always wipe down food tray, arm and head rests....W5 did a show on how unsanitary planes were...WJ being one of them...after they were supposedly clean....it can help"
"No matter how clean it looks, a plane is probably the dirtiest place you will ever enter voluntarily. I haven't been doing the wipe-down routine but it's not a bad idea. Masks for the immune-compromised or extra-cautious. Once in Cuba I would assume low risk from the new coronavirus unless the outbreak grows dramatically between now and your trip. You can go back to worrying about the hazards that never go away: dengue, hepatitis, influenza, gastroenteritis, the common cold, etc."
Its not like your going to China now that would scare me .Why would it scary from going to Cuba listen to your wife you know women they are always right lol.
I wanted to say why would it scare you from travelling to Cuba .Fingers are to big for the phone .

Dirty planes.... over half the trips we take to Cuba I wind up getting a bad cold about 3 days in...Coincidence?
I am sure that soon...upon arriving and going thru security we will be asked if you have recently traveled to China. Just like during the Ebola crisis we were asked if we had been to West Africa.
"Plane is a closed environment where the air is re-circulated. Coronavirus or not, even if one person is sick with a respiratory infection on the plane, chance are high you will catch it."
What kind of worries me is that we would probably be switching planes in Toronto or Montreal. I figure the darn cold here in Manitoba would kill off any virus.
"Hola grapenut @ 11That question was asked on the electronic Canadian Customs Declaration form we completed yesterday - specifically Wuhan, China - so don't see why they wouldn't ask in Cuba - although we were not asked when entering just over 1 week ago.Cheers"
Scout i think you do not want to go to Cuba why worry about something thats not even close to Cuba .It seems your looking for an excuse not to go careful you may sleep longer then you think in the basement lmao..
Cuba is probably one of the safe places to be during an epidemic.
"You can wear a 5gal plastic water bottle on you head , like the crazy Chinese Storm Troopers are wearing here , at the Vancouver airport right now Wish I could post pictures .Check them out on-line . Bloody rediculous .Johnny C"
"Never wiped down the seats, tray, nothing, think I'll start, not because of what's happening...just now after over 35 years of travelling..think it might be a good idea."
"your chances of getting sick are more in Canada, the Chinese new year is almost over there will 1000s of people coming back into Canada from China in the near future, the mask does not work the virus is airborne.Edited: 4:22 pm, January 30, 2020 "
"For the fact that there's only been 2 reported cases in Canada and 0 in Cuba, also it's mandatory to have travel insurance and Cuba is top 5 atleast in the world for their health care I personally don't care if I am there or here and I will be well taken care of IF I do get sick."
"Matt, you should be fine. Health or safety, Cuba is very good at scooping up tourists and moving them to a safe spot when required.100 people can be killed by a hurricane in Florida that just devastated Cuba where there were no fatalities. In Cuba, when there's a threat, you don't have a choice. You get on the bus and go to safety.Same with any threat. You have no choice but to follow the government plan.Have Fun!"
Cuba 5 at least around the World for health care ..Hope your joking .Trust me you do not want to go to a Hospital in Cuba if you ever get sick .As for travel insurand yes we should all have travel insurance but its not mandatory to have one ..
Yeah Spunky I'm not worried in the slightest!!!
I'm exaggerating but not worried it.
Mike has there been more today? Because has of last night there was 2.
"They had the body temperature heat guns out at all the Cuban airports during the SARS out break . 'They will likely do that again . We just walked by, never had a problem . Johnny C"
I am legend with will smith with my cold corona beer.
@ 17 I can't find the link news to that it's true?
