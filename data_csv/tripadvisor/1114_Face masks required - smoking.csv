I'm wondering if the most recent face mask requirements for CET properties means smoking/non-smoking sections.What are your thoughts?
"As far as I'm aware Ventian has banned smoking at tables, CET has not. For now at least."
"It's for EVERYONE, inside ALL of their properties! FINALLY someone had brains...Wed, Jun 24, 2020 (12:24 p.m.)Caesars Entertainment is requiring anyone entering their properties across the United States to wear a face mask to limit the spread of the coronavirus, the resorts company announced today.Previously, all employees and table games players were required to wear a mask. The change was implemented at noon.“We promised that Caesars would continue to evaluate the latest recommendations, directives and medical science regarding the COVID-19 public health emergency and modify our enhanced health and safety protocols accordingly,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of Caesars Entertainment. “As a result, we are immediately requiring everyone in our properties to wear masks, because the scientific evidence strongly suggests that wearing masks and practicing social distancing may be the most important deterrents to spreading COVID-19 from person to person.”The change applies to employees, vendors, contractors, guests and passersby in properties. It’s only for indoors.Caesars is the first Nevada resorts company to require that everyone wear a mask, but others could follow suit as the state has reported the largest one-day increase of new cases in four of the past eight days."
"Maybe use something like this? https://images.app.goo.gl/2dxaDhLk69z82c3C9Just a thought,Hunt"
@Post #3 - Full face coverage not allowed in the casinos.
"Just like it should already be, GO OUTSIDE to smoke."
"So, I'll have to drink my cocktails, wine and beer through a straw and a mask? That will go over real well!"

Sure hope these rules arent instituted next year or ten years from now when the yearly flu hits. We already now that tens of thousands will die from that so what will they do then? Or are those people expendable.
This is the golden opportunity to get rid of smoking and blame it on a situation over which the casinos have no control. There has never been and there will never be a better time to accomplish it.
Mike-We kept our masks on and just pulled them down to drink and then pulled them back up. It was not a hassle at all
"#9 I totally agree. Now is the perfect opportunity. I live in Ontario, Canada and our casinos have been smoke free for quite a while. I really don't think their business has suffered from the law. I'm sure it was met with resistance at first, but as non-smokers we love it."
Totally agree... only about 14% of the population in America smokes anymore. What about being concerned with the health of the remaining 86% of the population!? Blowing out smoke means blowing out Covid-19 particles into the air! Go outside and smoke!
"So which is worse......second hand smoke, or Covid?"
"yup tens of thousands die from flu complications every year. And hundreds of thousands have died of Covid in just six months. June and July look to be the worst months yet. Thanks to the ""it's just a flu"" crowd, now we have to shut everything down again."

"11... Not surprised that it didn't hurt business in Canada. I'm sure people would still go to Las Vegas if they could no longer smoke indoors.12... ""What about being concerned with the health of the remaining 86% of the population!?""Exactly!13... COVID infected droplets embedded in exhaled cigarette smoke is the concern.16... Of course you do! Because you care more about yourself than the people around you (see #12). But how will you smoke if you have to wear a mask? Just askin'."
Doesn’t sound like a fun time at all! I’m asthmatic and truly cannot breathe In the mask. My oxygen level drops. Should be a choice. Should be able to social distance and wash hands.
"""I smoke in Vegas and plan on continuing to do so, along with my cocktails!!""Wow, aren't you something?Edited: 2:20 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Just found this article: https:/…In the middle it says, ""The only exception is when employees or guests are eating or drinking. A Caesars spokesperson said casino customers who want to drink or smoke are advised to lower their mask, drink or smoke, then lift their mask back into place.""Ugh. I was really hoping that this mask-required rule would lead to designated outdoor smoking areas at all casinos. Pipe dream squashed.Edited: 8:05 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"@tonysherrie29,it it helps you out, a Las Vegas Review Journal article says there are medical exemptions, and from the sounds of things, you would certainly qualify. Specifically speaking. the exemption text says:""People with a medical condition — be it mental health, disability, or other reason — that prevents them from wearing a face covering, including people with any medical condition for whom wearing a face covering obstructs breathing or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a face covering without assistance.""Source: https:/…Edited: 9:02 pm, June 26, 2020 "
