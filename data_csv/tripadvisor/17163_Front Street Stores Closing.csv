Very sad times indeedVery unfortunate for the residents of SXM
"yes, its terrible. Philipsburg is like a ghost town."
"Hi Barb - this is so sad, the most important thing is to be safe and well."
"We are sure trying to be safe. but unfortunately not everyone is. Even though it affects businesses, government needs to impose some limits on the opening of the bars, clubs, and casinos. I believe we have 144 active cases as of today."
"Hubby and I typically go to Philipsburg once a week to support our friend who has a little bar there on the Boardwalk and watch a proper football match. Park at Bobby's Marina and walk to his place near St Rose Arcade. 1/4 mile or so? While we have our masks at hand, we see so few people along the way that we have never had to put them on. Helps that the boardwalk is almost as wide as a two lane road! Beach is almost deserted and Front Street is all but empty with many shops shuttered. Our favorite ""tourist"" shop is gone for good. Quite depressing AND alarming. With our numbers climbing, sadly we will not go back ""over the hill"" in the near future."
Right next door to Lazy Lizard! And they ARE open!
