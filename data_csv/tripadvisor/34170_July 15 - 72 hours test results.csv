"So I really don't want to cancel my trip because of the risky testing so I gave my hotel a call this evening, O:LV Fifty Five. They told me the 72 hour window is from when you receive your result.Example, I take a test on Monday. I get my results on Thursday. The 72 hours begin on Thursday.Still nervous because its hasn't been made clear by the government. Maybe others can check with there hotel to verify...."
I’m under the impression it’s test date. I actually changed our travel dates to be 72 hrs from test date. I’d love to be wrong.
"Hi, I am with you on that one. I am arriving to San Juan on August 2nd and I am trying to get a head start on what I need to do. I was considering not going to Puerto Rico as well due to the expectations of a test result within 72 hours. I literally called the covid hotline and health and hospitals out here in Brooklyn, NY to have them all tell me that results are coming back 5-7 days. I am going to give a call to my hotel too to see what they tell me. I have reached out to the airport via email but yet to receive a response."
"Hi, I hope you are wrong as well because I am losing sleep on trying to figure this out, even though I have time as my arrival isn't until August 2nd. I just don't want to go with results that they will turn down."
"Hi all, found this on https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/promiseStarting July 15, arriving passengers must complete a travel declaration form from the Puerto Rico Health Department, and show a negative molecular COVID-19 test result taken no more than 72 hours prior.Arriving travelers without this documentation will be offered a rapid COVID-19 test at the airport. Even if the test result is negative, the traveler will be required to quarantine and cover their own medical expenses/possible extended stay.Now does that mean the test result not the test? Cause then that would make more sense, arriving on a Sunday, results will be valid from Thursday up to my arrival. Tried to reach out to my hotel but no answer so I sent a brief email."
"The thing is I really don't want to just take one persons word on this, I think we on the forum should reach out to people in PR for more information."
"""I think we on the forum should reach out to people in PR for more information.""Some of the contributors on this forum are actually residents of the island. This situation is just very unclear to everybody. Typical of Covid-19, unfortunately.I would suggest trying to contact the airport and see if you can obtain clarity. And if so, please do share. Thank you in advance.Edited: 7:30 am, July 06, 2020 "
"Are all of the hotels expected to collect this information, too?"
"I have an email from the airport stating the 72 hr time frame is for the results, not the test itself. I asked my Airbnb host and he said it’s the test itself that must be performed within 72 hrs, which is also what the Discover PR website states if you scroll down to the Q&A portion. I also found the executive order signed by the governor but it’s only avail in Spanish and Google translator didn’t work so well. I’d love to know what the order itself says. It’s all very unclear and I don’t think folks in PR necessarily know either as we are all getting mixed answers. All I’m hoping for at this point is that the PR government finds a better way to keep them safe while also making it feasible for tourists to comply with their requirements. And they do that before I fly in on 7/16 :)"
"Good morning all,I just reached out to my hotel which is Wyndham Grand in Rio Grande and they told me that the test must be done within the 72 hour window and if we arrive on the island we will be quarantined somewhere else not the hotel until we provide the test results. This is very difficult to do when all labs out here are not processing earlier than 5 days! She even mentioned they aren’t accepting rapid test only the molecular ones ( nasal swab ) which I thought could be rapid as well but she said no. I really am thinking canceling as this requirement can not be done. I really hope there is more clarity and I have emailed the airport too but no one has reached out yet."
"""Are all of the hotels expected to collect this information, too?""No. Only the airport. The hotels are only doing temperature checks."
"We have a flight scheduled for 8/8. I had called SJU airport right before they announced that they were going to require a negative covid test as of the 15th and the person I spoke with was insistent that we would be under a 14-day quarantine even after I told him that we weren't coming in until August and at the time, the link below for the tourist info said that there would not be a quarantine but there was a chance of that happening if they felt that they needed to due to symptoms or whatever so I don't 100% trust what I hear from the airport.From what I can tell, the covid test needs to be performed 72 hours before you leave. I don't see any point in doing it a week prior and then running the risk of possibly being exposed during that time period.between my direct flights constantly being changed to really crappy ones with a long layover in FL and the fact that we can't get a rapid test done anywhere around here, what I'm hearing about people in PR possibly not taking all of this seriously and not wanting to risk getting exposed to this again when we get there, I'm done. I'm calling it quits on the entire summer and we'll try again next year.https:/…travel-advisory"
"The 72 hours only makes sense if the test is taken with the 72 hours of arrival. If you take it a week before its basically useless. Hawaii is doing the same thing and has worded the test must be taken within 72 hours of arrival. I’m almost with you Wendy, as have reservations to Hawaii 9.24, so I still have a bit of time to cancel. I’m waiting to find out how or if you can even get a test and the results in that 72 hours window. It seems pretty tight."
Also does anyone if kids require a test as well???
"Yes, kids as well."
"Hi, so after much confusion I received an email from the airport. This was included within that email. In summary, the test needs to be taken and results must be provided within that 72 hour window. I have previously taken a Covid-19 test and it came out negative, do I have to retest?Yes. All passengers who come to Puerto Rico must present a qualified SARS-CoV2 Covid-19 NEGATIVE MOLECULAR test result performed no more than 72 hours before traveling. You can find further details at: https://bit.ly/38eEe4c. What is the new entry requirement to visit Puerto Rico?To enter Puerto Rico, you must present a qualified SARS-CoV2 Covid-19 NEGATIVE MOLECULAR test result performed no more than 72 hours before traveling. You can see further details at: https://bit.ly/38eEe4c. If I don't have a qualified Covid-19 test result, can it be performed for me at the airport?To expedite the process, we recommend that you bring the results of the molecular test from your place of origin and that it has been performed no more than 72 hours before traveling. The waiting time to receive the rapid test at the airport can be very extensive. Where do I fill out the Travel Declaration Form?The Travel Declaration Form issued by the government will be available at https://english.sjuinsider.com/. It is not yet available at the moment.How is it possible that they are asking for the molecular test results if it takes three days to get the test results?Thank you for sharing your concern. As reported by the Government of Puerto Rico, ""it will be mandatory to bring the filled out travel declaration form and a qualified SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 negative molecular test result performed within 72 hours prior to arrival.""

"There are millions of people making sacrifices, oola. Missing a vacation is a small price to bear.A very large percentage of infected people don’t have signs and symptoms. PR has done a great job of limiting the disease. Allowing questionably healthy outsiders will quickly reverse all of that hard work.No one is going to “blame the island” and never come back, just as they are not “blaming New York” or “blaming the US” for excluding them.Edited: 6:23 am, July 07, 2020 "
"I was just going to state what northern traveler did. I was exposed to covid by an asymptomatic 90 yo and had to get a test. So taking temps, looking for symptoms is a bit worthless in my opinion if the carrier is asymptomatic, has taken a Tylenol maybe for pain etc. and that has brought a possible fever down. I think if states stopped mentioning 72 hours in regard to the test and maybe stated a rapid test needed to be done in that timeframe, it would help clear up confusion since I think that most people cannot get a regular test back in that timeframe. It's been taking 3-5 or more days where I live in NY. Even with testing, you can still get exposed after the test and not be aware so it's still very important to follow all the precautions. I also think it's important that if you're going to travel, it's important to kind of keep things low key and not be around people who are not taking this seriously. You don't want to bring covid back as a souvenir..."
"I couldn't agree more with Northern_Traveler00. Some people don't understand the huge sacrifices the locals had to make, and the extreme restrictions they had to endure in order to keep their numbers low. I know this because my parents live there, and told me all about it every day. If a vacation is all someone has to sacrifice, they should still be thankful because there's nothing worse than needing something, and not being able to go get it because of a curfew. It makes sense why the government is trying to protect the locals. Except for some who can't let go of trivial luxuries, most do understand the situation we are all going through. Tourism is not the priority right now, and people will not be discouraged from visiting the island in the future. This is the new normal. Staying safe is the priority. Not luxuries such as vacations."
Thank you @christinavel727 for sharing all that information. Your post was very helpful.
"@oolalasoo, your very welcome!"
This link might help you to distinguish between the types of test.https:/…coronavirus-testing-basicsThere are molecular test that provides same day results it just depends on where you take the test and if they do their own analysis or send it out to a third party. I have a trip to PR on the 24th so I've been calling around and asking about the types of test.
"If the test is taken within 72 hours of arrival and results are not received until day 7, does that mean a 3 day quarentine once on the island until results can be submitted that were negative? I have read two completely different versions. SJ airport says that you only have to quarentine until you can submitt negative results and then also says there's an ""option"" to get tested on the island. However, Discover Puerto Rico states that showing up without negative results at time of arrival means the test must be taken ON THE ISLAND and you must submit negative results to be ""released from quarentine"". Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have called and emailed every possible agency, tourist site, airport etc but have gotten zero responses."
i was wondering the same thing and have been looking for clarification. but i havent found any clarity on that order
"I wouldn't recommend trying to get tested once you're there. If you still plan on going, your best bet is to find somewhere to go near you to get a rapid molecular test done within that 72-hour time frame.I have a feeling that the ones offered at the airport are the antigen tests which is why they are going to make you quarantine until you can get another (molecular) test done on the island and who knows how easy they are to come by and how long the results take to get back.If you get a regular test before you leave, make sure that they will email your results that looks official. I'm not sure if they want something on official letterhead or what. I never got anything but a phonecall when I had to get tested. Since the Discover Puerto Rico website just states that you'd have to quarantine until you get your results from a test done on the island, not until your results show up from home so that would make me a bit nervous. The airport already gave me wrong information once so I don't 100% trust what they say."
"Re: San Jusn new Covid policy: read that test be done within 72 hours of arrival, and will accept only molecular swab test. On the mainland test site list linked to the Puerto Rico Covid policy webpage, I looked at all the test sites listed and none offer that molecular swab test but they offer other swab, but not that one. From what I read, that molecular swab test is only available to sick patients in hospital. Has anyone clarified with Puerto Rican government? Does anyone know where to get molecular swab test in mainland? Thank you"
"I have called the Departamento de salud in Puerto rico as I am also travelling there in the beginning of august. The test must be done within 72 hours. the NYS says that results typically come in from 5 to 7 days but usually it takes 3 days. If you go to an urgent care and tell them you may have come into contact with someone positive, they will do the swab test on you with no appointment needed. If the date of the specimen collection is outside of the 72 hour mark, your results will not be accepted, even if it comes in within those three days. This is coming directly from the Puerto rico's health department and I have confirmed it with NYS health department as well. It MUST be the swab test. The blood test is NOT ACCEPTED.Hope this helps."
"I called the governor's office; she said test Must be Swab Molecular test, which we don't have here, so I cancelled my trip but hope to see beautiful San Juan some other time."
"Hello, My question is where to access the travel declaration form? Has anyone been able to find it? I have been looking on all the websites I can find from the health department http://www.salud.gov.pr/Pages/Home.aspx to SJU airport website http://www.salud.gov.pr/Pages/Home.aspx I cannot find this form anywhere."
Nannette R - try this: https:/…TUR-Travel-Contact-Lodging-ENG.pdf
Agreed!!!!!!!!!!
I read somewhere that they will be handed out on the plane!
I found this link from JetBlue for traveling to PR https://travelsafe.pr.gov/ it has the online travel declaration. Hope this helps! I too will be going there July 24th so any updates from anyone arriving on the 15th or after will be greatly appreciated.
Hello thank you for the info I’m traveling on the 24th as well.. were you able to find a place that does the rapid testing?Thanks
I'm from MA and we have a few spots that I have called that guarentee molecular results within 48 hrs.
Travelsafe.pr.gov
Thank you Liz
"FYI from the travel declaration: “I certify that I made a PCR test over a period of 72 hours or less before reaching Puerto Rico and I am awaiting results. I agree to remain in quarentine, until I report the negative result of the PCR test to the Puerto Rico Department of Health or until I leave Puerto Rico, whichever comes first. I certify that if the result of the molecular test (PCR) is positive, I will remail in isolation. I will be responsible for covering the cost associated with isolation and any medical care if necessary. I will not be able to travel until the Puerto Rico Department of Healt gives me authorization”SO if you took a test within 72 hours prior to arriving but don’t have the result, you are ok, but must quarantine until you have the results, then you can be released from quarantine, even if the results are now more than 72 hrs old."
"This is worrisome!!!That means if you arrive and do not have the test, you cannot stay at the hotel- so WHERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE STAYING?! It is very correct and prudent for the hotel not to accept the guest. They should not! Then again.... what a mess!!!"
I’m curious to know if there are any updates or anyone’s experience on this. I took a test Saturday and I’m arriving I. PR on Wednesday. I’m not sure if this will be ok or if I will have to quarantine.
More than 72 hours means that test is no longer valid.
You have to have been tested no longer than 72hrs before arriving in PR. I just returned from the Island today. Our party was all able to get test results in 24 hours (NYC) and thus we had a QR code to show at the airport when we exited that said we did not have to quarantine. I cannot comment on the airport experience if you either have not been tested or do not have your result but I know you are supposed to quarantine for 14 days or the duration of your trip in both of those cases.
@janna where in NYC did u take the test? I live in Queens and would like results back ASAP. Health + hospitals has been taking more than 5 days to report back from what I hear
"I have been tested twice (once in June and once in August) at Jacobi hospital and got 24h results both times. The fastest results are at the H+H hospital locations not the H+H community sites. Before my PR trip a couple weeks ago me and my 3 travel companions also got 24h results from Gotham hospital in Harlem and Kings county hospital in Brooklyn.Edited: 12:37 am, August 29, 2020 "
"Just a heads up to everyone, even if your test results are greater than 72 hrs you’ll still be allowed to enter but they’ll instruct you to quarantine for your whole time or get tested there. What many have done is get tested one or two days before their arrival date and quarantine until their hospital sends their results digitally. If their results are negative they can end their quarantine for the rest of their stay."
