"Hi,Me and my wife are travelling to Paris in the end of October for 6-7 days. We require a studio apartment nearby the tourist attraction. We are on a limited budget and are looking for anything under 80 Euros per day. Can anyone suggest us with a few options available for these apartments as I have researched and found out that hotels turn out to be quite expensive.. We are looking something in the City Center so it is easy to move around by just walking or by bus or metro. Request if someone could share their valuable inputs. Thank you in advance."
"You'll find some in your budget with Centre Paris ( http://en.centerparis.com/ ), but they're basic apartments, no luxury. Read their fine print carefully so you understand what to expect (important with *any* apartment rental). You may find something on VRBO, also."
"In addition to all the suggestions to your previous inquiry, you may want to have a look at http://centreparis.com/"
thank you .. will look into it.. but would be glad if anyone has already been to an apartment and has something to share..
"<< but would be glad if anyone has already been to an apartment and has something to share>>It would seem that you just do not realize the urgency of your request and hope that someone here will recommend a particular place for you, which is unlikely to happen. Though, if you were to provide specific dates, someone here may do a bit of searching for you.It is extremely late to be booking for the ""end of October"", particularly at or under your budget and in a ""nearby the tourist attractions"" central location. The longer you wait, the fewer options you will have.Highly recommend that you pursue some of the many suggestions you have received."
thanks for your suggestion... i would like to book from 26th October to 1st November. Would be glad if someone could suggest one or two suggestions because I am quite confused with the options present and need help. tHANKS
Ibis.com has some cheaper hotel rooms. I agree that it's quite late to find an apartment for next month.
We booked our apartments a year in advance.I suggest you start seriously looking for an option and not expecting others to do the work for you.You might also consider using Priceline or similar and can research that at biddingfortravel.com
"Saiud, I may have suggested this in your other thread, but I'd get on it ASAP. Go to booking.com and put in your dates and budget. When you get some likely looking candidates, cross check them here on TA for reviews. The longer you wait, the fewer options you'll have."
This confusion regarding Paris seems to be epidemic!! I have seen so many lately confused. Why be confused just start checking on some of the suggestions and see what is available for your dates. I have sometimes spent hours working on my accommodations...it takes time.
I went to VRBO.com Plugged in your dates and came up with lots if options. Here is just one of them for 65 euros a night:http://www.vrbo.com/409586
Good job Darths-lady. That studio would be a good choice. The owner is known to be very reputable. I'd not hesitate to book it right away.
"Good idea, but if the OP doesn't get on it, I'm willing to bet it will be booked soon.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I know it was adoable, great price and great reviews...gessh I am bookmarking it for myself!"
"If I were traveling to Paris solo, I wouldn't hesitate to book it. Olivier's apartment are well-managed."
"Might I ask what is VRBO, and why is the apartment so inexpensive?"
"Denise, VRBO is Vacation Rentals by Owner, a listing service where owners can advertise their rental properties.www.vrbo.comMy guess as to the price is because the unit is teeny tiny (but probably perfect for the OP's requirements.)"
"VRBO is the abbreviation for Vacation Rentals By Owner (vrbo.com), the name of a website that lists vacation rentals.Edited: 5 years ago "
"The apartment is very small, and is away from tourist central. But in a great location IMO."
that is an excellent suggestion Darths lady...very cute place and looks nice and fresh but extremely small...as mentioned it is exactly what OP is saying he is looking for...and nice of you to check availability too.
"Thank you! I've some questions, but don't want to intrude on the op's space, so I will post a follow up for mine.To the op, have a brilliant time!"
"Gotta pay it forward around here, I have gotten so many great tips...my ""trip notebook"" has pages and pages of idea I received from TA!"
"With the help of a gal who knows her rentals, just last week I booked Oliviers flat for the entire month of February. Beyond excited. It's teeny tiny but I'll live, lol.Will review and let you all know how it went."
"Hi Cat-quick question did you purchase your airfare then do the apartment rental? I would love to book an apartment now, but not sure it would be wise to book the apartment before the flight."
"Hi Darth,I checked airfares for about 2weeks, no change, still pretty high nonstop from Philly.Then I booked the apartment and the airfare the same day. With the money I saved on the tiny rental, I guess I splurged a bit on air.This is how I usually do it. Sometimes it goes up, it's always a bit of a risk. Good Luck!"
"<< did you purchase your airfare then do the apartment rental? I would love to book an apartment now, but not sure it would be wise to book the apartment before the flight>>Everything turns on how far in advance you plan. And, it's to your extreme benefit to conduct a LOT of research at least a year prior, whereupon you can analyze air fares and have the best choice of apartments.In my experience, it's better to book the apartment first, then keep an eye on air fares.`"
thank you everyone for the help you have given.. its very useful for me.. and i am surely going to go forward with the suggestions and let you guys know what i have booked.. thanks once again all.. :)
I tried on centerparis.com but i am not able to contact the owner. Tried sending the information form but not going through.. can anyone help?
"Suaid, your best bet at this late time is to find a nice hotel and book it.The thing is, if you rent an apartment, there is going to be NO ONE to whom you can ask questions. You'll be on your own to figure all this stuff out. Truly, this trip you need to book a hotel.Edited: 5 years ago "
"As usual just not getting it...Darth's has provided a DIRECT link above...I looked at it ...right their you ""contact owner"" and indicate what you are looking for. He will then reply directly to you. Don't have a clue what centerparis has to do with this vrbo (for rent by owner) listing. I also note that absolutely the only week available on the calendar is the week that OP needs. I would have been on that yesterday...I get the impression OP wants Darth's lady (as helpful as she is) to book it for him. Happy Goin above makes some excellent points about needing a ""front desk"" on site to help with things once in Paris...but I think to even find a hotel at the price of this apartment may be a big challenge at this point."
"gene, I think that the OP was trying to contact centreparis because it was suggested earlier in the thread. As much as that VRBO apartment appears to be a perfect fit, I agree with HappyGoin that the OP may be better off with a hotel. I'd check www.booking.com and see what's available."
F1racegirl...okay I guess so much conversation was around that apartment he was trying to contact the owner. I guess I agree that hotel is the best option for this poster.
Well i have checked Darth's suggestion out and also emailed the same to Oliver. Just waiting for him to get back to me. I am looking for something closer to Eiffel tower as well.. The apartment is near 28 rue feydeau 75002.. I need convenience to Eiffel tower as got some work nearby.. Can anyone comment on how this area is and is it lively? Is it also considered to be in City Center?Edited: 5 years ago 
"Suaid,Do you have a map of Paris? If you look at one, the ""center"" of the city is Notre Dame. With the wonderful transportation system, though, most places are very convenient so no need to be in the center.The apt on rue feydeau is only fractionally closer to the ET than Darth's suggestion, and not really close at all. Both will take you almost exactly the same amount of time on the metro (about 30 min.) Darth's is actually a better choice, imo, because it is very close to a metro station and has a known and reliable owner - something that is crucial in renting an apartment.I, do, however, agree with the others that you should book a hotel. A hotel would give you the added bonus and comfort of someone to help you and answer all your questions once on the ground."
"Well its in Paris 7th andorssiment. I am thinking should i go with Darth's recommendation or the one which I have seen.. The link to the apartments is as below: www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p949381a…www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p949381a…www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p6584380…I would be happy if anyone can throw some light on how these apartments are or should I still go with darth's recommendation. Please everyone I am trying to locate the best possible place, so kindly try and help. We all are here to help each other. Thank you"
"I booked my apt for October 11-19 a month ago fron VacationinParis. Many of the our choices were already booked at that time. A cheap apt in cnetral Paris woud be the frist to get booked.VRBO is a listing service only. What you get depends on that particular apt and landlord. you would need to find reviews for exactly that place. I have rented apts in italy and Paris. My own rental history successes are mixed, so I only rent apts from agencies I have used before, or ones with multiple reviews at neutral sites. I have read that VRBO gives the landlords the right to censor bad reviews."
"Considering that this is your first trip to Paris, you should definitely be looking for a hotel. You don't have the time it takes to find an acceptable apartment, and with your extremely limited knowledge of the city, you will definitely need some day-to-day support - you won't get help from anyone, if you rent an apartment. People who rush into renting an apartment are often targets for scams. I wouldn't risk it, if I were you.You should Google budget hotels in the nearby 15th, 14th or 13th arrondissements, which are significantly cheaper than anything you'd find in the 7th or the ""center"" - they would be just a few minutes by Metro to the Eiffel Tower. I found several in the Accor chain that were in your price range, but there are definitely others."
well i have short listed to 4 apartments according to my research for my stay from 25th OCtober to 1st November. Can anyone help me in suggesting which would be the best option among all the 4 (as which is closer to the center of the City and easy to move around). I would be needing to travel to Arc de triomphe frequently as I got some work there so can anyone suggest what would be my best bet keeping everything into consideration as I need metro to get there as well plus shops around for eating and shopping.. below are the options:parisattitude.com/rent-apartment/…parisattitude.com/rent-apartment/…http://www.vrbo.com/1153746ha#reviewshttp://www.vrbo.com/409586
Paris Attitude does not have a good reputation. I would scratch those off of your list. If you are dead-set on an apartment the previously mentioned Voltaire studio is through a reputable owner. If it's available then you should book it after confirming that you are comfortable with the check-in and check out process and the payment arrangements.Edited: 5 years ago 
Thank you for your suggestion.. I am striking off paris attitude from my list.. So I have got these 2 options left now: http://www.vrbo.com/1153746ha#reviewshttp://www.vrbo.com/409586there are metros available from both the location.. but is there a direct metro that leads me to Arc de triomphe as I would be going there frequently due to some work.. and what about the locality of both the locations.. I know you have suggested Oliver's apartment as it is trustworthy.. anyway if anyone else also has an opinion it is more than welcome.. i will be booking the place by tomorrow itself so please let me know your suggestions asap.. thank you..
Either choose the Voltaire studio or book a hotel. The owner of the Voltaire Studio is known to several forum regulars and has a good reputation. You do not have the luxury of time to to do the required due diligence on the other apartment.
"Recommend inquiring immediately to verify availability of both, as neither calendar has been updated for several days."
I assume that OP was only considering places that he has confirmed are available at this point but that is probably a silly assumption.
yes both these places are available and I have confirmed with the owner... but as the reviews are going towards Olivers apartment I guess it would be the best choice. hope i am right on this
Suaid - You need to look at a map of Paris to find out where things are located. You also need to learn how to get around town. This is a good website that explains everything for you.www.ratp.frLearn to use both of these tools - it will be much faster than asking multiple questions on a travel forum.I sincerely hope you take the advice of people who are urging you to book a hotel room. They have your best interest in mind.

OP --PLEASE just book a hotel. It's obvious that you will have lots of questions once you actually arrive in Paris. A hotel can be a major asset and help you have a successful trip.Many on this forum research apartments for months. You are trying to become informed in a very short time.You will enjoy your trip a lot more if you have a resource to fall back on.And many hotels can be had within your budget.
"Suaid...just book Oliver's apartment now...just do it. I have a tendancy to not make decisions too but at some point just do it. At least people here know the owner and from what I saw online it looks cute but be prepared to be ""cozy""...but you will be out seeing Paris. You need to book it and spend your time planning your days."
