Please do not visit now. The state is basically closing down. There is no reason I can think of to make a vacation out of visiting California now. You are putting yourself at risk and also putting others at risk. Change your plans. Cancel if already have plans.
Excellent message.
Not sure anyone can get there now! Hope all is clear by September... keep safe and well everyone.
Thanks Captain Obvious.
"RE: ""Captain Obvious""I don't think that is called for. It is not obvious for some people. I have seen people still wanted to go to China from U.K. even though the Chinese embassy stopped to accept new visa applications for the next few months. Because they couldn't stand the pain of potentially losing the money already paid for the upcoming trip."
"Please, EVERYONE knows not to travel anywhere. Pretty sure that includes CA. There will always be jerks who don't listen."
"I wouldn’t want to travel in California to begin with. There are better places that I’d rather travel to because they offer better prices, better accommodations, better Public transportation Options etc etc. that’s my suggestion."
#6. Obviously a troll. Best to not respond.
"#3–Amazingly, it’s not obvious to many folks. There are, sadly, a lot of people who aren’t taking the health crisis seriously and refuse to practice social distancing when outside, let alone the Shelter in Place mandates. The OP’s post is needed. Sometimes it takes a village..."
"Per #8,I think that the crowds at Florida beaches, for Spring Break, probe that point.Now, they are heading home, spreading whatever they contracted there.Oh well...Hunt"
"Bay Area officials are irate about the weekend crowds at parks and beaches, and the governor has ordered parking at state parks and beaches closed to prevent people from gathering. https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/M…https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/S…https:/…"
"What do ""sanctuary cities"" have to do with the homeless? Although, yes, the homeless are very vulnerable to something like COVID-19. Hopefully, in the future our society as a whole will do more to reduce the number of vulnerable people by providing them with better support (shelter, medical care, etc.), for everyone's benefit."
Dr Jim I don’t think you know what sanctuary city means. Some sanctuary cities and counties are huge food producers for the country. I can guarantee that some on the front lines bringing you food are undocumented.
"I was to visit SocCal from Ireland in April with my family obviously we cancelled a few weeks ago, kids understandably gutted. I'v told them that maybe we can go around Halloween - so I'm really hoping things can get back to normal come Oct/Nov, any thoughts on that? With the steps we are taking here we hope to see some semblance of normality return in May/ June! - I like to book flights accommodation etc early to avail of better value but I'm reluctant in the current environment."
Travel from other countries is particularly iffy. You have no idea when those restrictions will be lifted.
"Our administration is now saying the current ‘lock-down’ will go for two more weeks, no more...Trump wants to give the green light to big business, as well as tell people they can get back to work...if that incredibly dangerous position, in my opinion, is allowed to go forth, all this sacrifice and effort to curb the coronavirus in this country will come to a halt....it is anybody’s guess what will happen. Throughout history there have been world leaders considered to be madmen and I find his position terrifying. So, future travel plans for holidays in the U.S. need to be carefully weighed against the backdrop of ill-conceived policies. I believe the best bet is to stay informed via the CDC and the World Health Organization..I do hope you can visit us sooner rather than later and that we can also travel abroad and have great adventures again."
Amen Chester. Hopefully we can depend on governors to make wiser decisions and limit travel into their own states if this ill conceived “idea” goes through.
I should be accurate. Trump and Pence assert they never said for the U.S. to be on ‘lock-down’...of course why would anyone lock down a country for the flu or a cold? I used the term intermingling with our Sheltering in Place.
"Dr. Jim may know medicine, but he really has to explain how ""sanctuary cites"" increase homelessness--with some data. Methinks he was simply trying to take a swipe at a policy he doesn't like.Edited: 6:06 am, March 25, 2020 "

"Thanks for your service, Dr. JIM. Please concentrate on your local area and not California."
"I've been thinking a lot about when things will be back to ""normal."" San Francisco Bay Area has had a steeper curve than SoCal and many of our more rural counties are not fully into testing, yet. It's so hard to say whether by flattening the curve (which CA is surely doing so far as compared to New York or Georgia or LA)...will the process take longer? That's what the models predict - fewer numbers of patients at a time, with a longer course until herd immunity is achieved.For example, the public universities have either already announced or are contemplating being closed until August. I think the K-12 will go the same way.Then, when everyone goes back to school, they may go back in cohorts and only every other day. This is all to keep the infection rate flat so that we have beds and ventilators to handle it. Rather than have a 2 month crash-the-system event, we will have a longer event. People will still die, but hopefully some palliative therapies will be discovered to lower those future rates.I'd wait until Summer 2021, myself (since we will obviously stlll be dealing with CV19 when everyone goes back to school - and it will climb again next winter)."
"Whether we are indeed flattening the curve remains to be seen imho. Remember that the Koreans have only succeeded in fits and starts, and even now that success is still shaky. And this is in a liberal democracy with a credible solid bureaucracy with a highly informed and educated citizenry....and an effective social shaming culture.Emerging as a “success” story might even be Germany with a high infection rate but with a low mortality rate. That is because Germany mobilized testing, tracing, isolating, and treating early in their cycle. Still a lot of gaps in our processes, and the clock has moved on."
Why do trolls have nothing better to do with their time then make smartarse comments. They much have such a boring life to bother doing this :(
