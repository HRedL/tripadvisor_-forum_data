"Have a 5 day trip planned for mid March. I am reconsidering because there is so little transparency as to what is really going on in China w regard to the coronavirus infection, and potential travel risk in London. I realize no one can predict what is going to happen, but is there a slowdown in tourism in London due to this? I am blowing this out of proportion?"
"I think you are blowing it way out of proportion.If you're that nervous about it, make the best decision for yourself and don't travel basically anywhere in the world.No one will give you a guarantee.Edited: 9:06 pm, February 09, 2020 "
"Yep, your last line says it all!You are blowing it out of proportion, and don’t take this the wrong way, but you are being pretty dumb to cancel over this!I think as of now there are only 4 confirmed cases of the Virus in the UK, that’s out of a Population of 66 million, I’ll let you do the Math, but you have more chance of Winning the National Lottery than contracting the Virus!"
"Did the other, identically named and still active thread here not give you any hint?"
As if Orlando is not a destination visited by people from all over the world?
hii am a singaporean going to travel to UK for holidays this week . i have no travel history to china. is there a need to have myself on isolated OR quarantine FOR 14 days under the law ?

My husband and I are also departing for London in mid March and it didn't occur to us to cancel. We're more likely to get hit by a car because we didn't look the right way when crossing the road than we are contracting this virus. You're traveling in the right direction!Live your life and enjoy.
"'I am blowing this out of proportion?' Yes.Consider the number of people exposed to nCoV who have been ill and recovered, some of whom will not know they had been exposed to the virus. The number of confirmed cases in China looks substantial until one considers the population of the country.There have been 12 cases of nCoV-related illness in the USA but only three in the UK. https:/…"
In China 0.07 people per hundred thousand have died from the corona virus. In Orlando 30 people per hundred thousand are murdered. In London 1.48 per hundred thousand are murdered. Nobody in the UK has died from the corona virus.Do these figures give you some perspective? One inference is that you should get out of Orlando as quickly as you can.
"To answer your last question - the chance of contracting coronavirus in London is comparable to your risk of catching it at home- unless you are holed up at home in a bunker with a controlled air supply. Your chance of picking it up on a flight is marginally higher but there are few flights to the uk from China now and the likelihood of someone having been to china and then fkying on your flight to florida is miniscule. The chance of someone doing so and having an active infection is smaller and the chance of them giving it to you is even less. Then if you got the infection it's like flu, most people recover.China is being unusually open and also doing almost everything it can to contain the virus. It is simply overwhelmed and therefore unable to test people/ accurately assess what is happening. If this occurred in America you'd also be unable to cope. The only other thing they could do is accept more help from outside and they have started doing that.A major over-reaction to risk."
"Well, it looks the UK govt is taking it a lot more seriously now. Here's some breaking news as at 07.30 Feb 10.""The Secretary of State declares that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and the measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus."""
"If you do visit, I promise I won't breathe on you, just in case."
What are the regulations that have been made? …sky.com/story/coronavirus-serious-and-immin…
"Thankfully the death rate in China is low from Coronavirus, mostly affecting those who already have respiratory ailments (asthma, etc), and the elderly. If you are in relatively good health there is no more need to fear Coronavirus than the annual flu outbreak. It is just that flu does not get so much publicity."
">>> I realize no one can predict what is going to happen <<<Precisely. What I do know though is that virtually everyone that has died so far had underlying health problems, so were immuno-compromised - a bad outbreak of flu would probably also have killed them had they not had flu jabs. If I were to succumb to coronavirus I would expect to be seriously unwell for a couple of weeks (and probably in isolation) but I would expect to go on to make a full recovery. I've had flu before so I would expect a coronavirus episode to be similar."
Why do you think there is a difference between London and your home country in terms of risk ? Don't you have tourists visiting america ?
"Hmmm..surely, rather than encouraging people to travel, this whole thing would be over more quickly if everyone stayed home for the next three months?If it has got to the UK, it came on a plane."
re 17 Dingle expert. ?? respectfully regmaiche
"#11 - seems to be a technical point to allow compulsion on those in quarantine now, one is apparently threatening to leave early - the overall threat level unchanged at “moderate”"
"By March I think we can assume that it will either be contained or will be a full-blown worldwide emergency. Not much any of us can do about it other than be a bit more vigilant about normal common sense.The one thing you can do now if you are planning to travel is get a flu jab if you can. It won't protect you against coronavirus, but if you did get flu while you were away, not only would it ruin your holiday but you'd have terrible trouble getting home!"
"One person in quarantine didn't want to stay - to compel them to do, and to prevent others wanting to follow, so the government has had to declare a serious threat. It could be challenged in court by judicial review but wouldnt get anywhere.You can buy things that are believed to boost the immune system - being elderly and therefore at risk from flu I have a few days supply. The best protection against many viruses is always to wash your hands thoroughly. Personally I'll be avoiding Brighton - but not London."
Chinatown is noticeably dead right now (which is a shame).I haven’t noticed any visible reduction in tourists in London overall.
"Personally I'll be avoiding Brighton - but not London.————————Many thousands of people travel between these two places every day, I’m not specifically avoiding anywhere. In central London yesterday most people were trying to avoid the rain."
"A superspreader who is known to have infected 11 people in more than one country was in Brighton and in a pub there the evening before he fell ill. No-one yet knows exactly how many more people will have picked up the virus from him or from the people he infected. If I visit Brighton I may come into contact with one of more of these people, if I visit London then it's a city of millions and if any of the infected have travelled to London it's more unlikely I'll meet them. By the end of March, when the OP is here, we'll know more about numbers infected in Brighton. So my risk assessment - which is on the very cautious side since I have other health conditions - is that the risk in London is miniscule and the risk in Brighton is a bit higher."

"I’m going to Brighton on Tuesday and I’m not bothered as Brighton is a popular home destination for those commuting into London. So it goes to say that if it’s going to spread surely it will anyway due to heavy traffic and there’s gatwick airport which is going to be another entry point for the corona virus. Seriously so far, the average flu which strikes winter time is a bigger danger. And any suggestions that people stay at home instead of travelling. It’s simply not feasible."
I think that you are not blowing this out of proportion but you have totally overlooked the risk of contracting it where you live in Orlando Florida.This is a huge magnet for visitors from everywhere and corner of the world. People reach Orlando by travelling through airports and sit on planes flying from unknown multiple routes. Concentrate on home risk. You will be fine if you follow Department of Health instructions.
"Coincidentally, a friend of mine flew out of Heathrow to Florida a couple of days ago. He had a bit of a cough and a runny nose; and he's a nurse who works in a hospital up in Merseyside, although not at Arrowe Park Hospital! ;-)"
"Yesterday I've read about 8 cases of Coronavirus in UK. I'm not going to cancel my trip to Manchester and London because of these.

"Yuri - I can't remember whether or not you have asked for any pub recommendations for Manchester! Anyway, might I suggest The Britons Protection and The Marble Arch. The Crown and Kettle close to the Marble Arch is also worth checking out."
"At the moment there are only a small number of victims in the U.K.And that seems to reassure people that they can come here and statistically they are safe.Let’s turn the coin over If the Coronavirus is to spread here It will have been brought in by a traveler or twoStatistics It is said that each person affected will infect 2.5 other people.The virus has an attack rate of 60-80% Statisticians have said that it is possible that 60% of the world population could become infected .Unless major cities employ lock down protocols.https:/…Edited: 4:45 pm, February 11, 2020 "
"'Statisticians have said that it is possible that 60% of the world population could become infected ' All right, let's say that number do come in contact with nCoV. A percentage of those people will have mild to moderate illness and recover having then developed antibodies to the virus. A smaller number of people with other comorbidities will become more gravely ill, but with early identification of the pneumonia caused by nCoV they should be offered supportive care for that and their other conditions. An even smaller number will die as a result of nCoV plus other comorbidities.Trying to 'employ lock down protocols' will have an economic effect that could send the world into recession making 2008 look like a party.The time for trying to ring-fence the potentially infected population has more or less passed. The focus now should be on identification of new cases and treating them accordingly, although again those with a mild form of the illness may not know it's nCoV.The basics still hold: wash your hands frequently, don't cough or sneeze into an open palm, and if you develop a respiratory illness see your GP."
"Matt, according to my Russian connections, best preventive measure for this Coronavirus is permanently high percentage of alcohol in one's blood. I've been recommended to visit Armenian Taverna in Manchester for their variety of Armenian&Russian dishes, and reduced prices on Vodka. It's their contribution to the ""war effort"" I guess.Since I won't be driving in this trip, I'll follow this health recommendation to it's last letter, zealously as only I know how. Reminds me of Mark Twain's ""How to cure a cold"". Just as amusing.I'm still building up my London leg of Coronavirus preventive treatment locations! Plenty to choose from...Yuri."

"I will also be visiting London (for the first time) and also Paris in late March. I for one am not so worried about catching/dying from this virus on this trip. If it's THAT bad in London of all places by that time, then nowhere on Earth is safe. And we'll all have much more to worry about than some messed up travel plans. As an Asian-American however, and as a Mandarin speaker, I do worry somewhat about potential anti-Asian sentiment my family and I might face while in Europe due to this situation. I generally need to speak the language to communicate with my parents, and I'm afraid that this will make us even more conspicuous when out in public. But then again, it's not like xenophobia doesn't exist here in the States. Oh well, it's out of my control at this point. I'm still really excited about the trip! It's been my dream for so long to visit London, and this dang virus will have to literally end the world to stop me from going!Edited: 11:38 pm, February 11, 2020 "
"'As an Asian-American however, and as a Mandarin speaker, I do worry somewhat about potential anti-Asian sentiment my family and I might face while in Europe due to this situation' That you are of Asian background and speak Mandarin isn't likely to be notable in London where there is a large Asian population and over 250 languages are spoken.'I generally need to speak the language to communicate with my parents, and I'm afraid that this will make us even more conspicuous when out in public.' My experience in London is that people speaking Mandarin, Cantonese or Shanghainese is almost as common as it is in my city - it's part of everyday life and not something notable.I hope you enjoy your holiday in London and Paris."
"Giving someone good information does not make people less likely to travel, trying to suppress information and scaremongering both do so.I'm high risk if I get the virus and risk averse - and the statement that this ""could spread to 60% of the population"" I see as scaremongering. Of course it could - but that would require that everyone was stupid and that governments took no action to prevent it. I'm willing to believe a significant proportion of the population are stupid, including anyone who worries about that 60% statement, but not everyone. It's also clear governments are taking action. The number of new cases being diagnosed in China appears to have peaked. Where it has spread outside China it is so far being contained.I think it wrong to tell people that they wont experience anti chinese sentiment. Xenophobia does indeed exist everywhere but we have strong laws against it here so while a few people may make you feel uncomfortable anything more than that would promptly be dealt with by police. As a result you may experience black looks and people moving away but it's very unlikely to go beyond that.My wife and I (white British) have experienced xenophobia in America - perhaps due to the American fondness for making Brits the villains in all their films or the British reputation for not tipping. We smiled and ignored it."
"By March, you will be presumably at as much risk wherever you live as in London."
""" As an Asian-American however, and as a Mandarin speaker, I do worry somewhat about potential anti-Asian sentiment my family and I might face while in Europe due to this situation.""You probably won't face any negative sentiment, but reportedly coughing and then speaking Mandarin is a reliable way to secure a seat and some space on a crowded train.Edited: 1:46 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"First case in London reported Senior scientific figures have played down the significance of the confirmation that a case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the UK’s largest population centre. Dr Michael Tildesley, associate professor in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Warwick, has said:It has been confirmed this is a case where an individual has travelled from China and has been detected whilst in London. So we don’t have enough evidence at this stage to say that it is spreading in London - we have had an introduction of the virus to London from an individual that has travelled from China but as yet, no reported human-to-human transmission as a result of this new case.There always remains the risk of introduction of cases into the UK from international travellers and it is difficult to predict where future introductions may occur. So it’s not surprising that there is a case in London since it is the main UK hub for international travellers.What needs to be done at this stage is to carry out contact tracing, in a similar way that has been done for other cases, in order to detect any contacts as rapidly as possible and if they show symptoms of the disease, follow the necessary protocols to minimise the risk of them causing further infections.It is important of course that people remain vigilant and minimise their own risk of being infected but at this stage it is too early to say the extent of the risk of onward transmission as a result of this new case.”"
How many people live in London? How many are reported sick? Not everyone dies from this. I am going in March. Wash your hands. I think it is ok. Not any worse than where you are living now.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it true that the UK doesn't have restrictions on those who have traveled from China recently?So who we gonna blame? Brexiteers, Remainers or the EU?My money is the press will blame the EU...."
"I have just returned from a cruise that was aborted because the cruise line stupidly allowed passengers who had transited through China/Hong Kong in the previous 14 days to board. We were then refused entry to the next five ports (in two countries) and spent a week bobbing around in the South China Sea trying to find a port that would allow us in. No-one on the cruise got the virus.Whilst we were bobbing around one of the TV channels (possibly CNN) carried an interview with somoen from Johns Hopkins infectious diseases unit. He was scathing about the travle ban even in Wuhan, and pointed out that in China only cases of the virus that came to the attention of the hospitals were being recorded - mild cases weren't recorded. His take was that onece the other cases were added in the death rate would be around the same as for normal flu where all the precautions would not have been put in place & would affect the same sorts of people i.e those with underlying medical conditions.Edited: 12:35 am, February 13, 2020 "
"According to the BBC this morning there has been an increase in the number of deaths in China, but this has been explained away because China has now changed the way it records the cases.Ever since this has happened I’ve been crunching the numbers, I’m a bit obsessed like that, should have been an analyst! Anyway when you process the number of deaths v cases, it has never gone over 2.5%.Even then there is always the phrase “underlying heath problems” associated with those deaths.This is no more than what can happen with normal Flu, I just find that people are blowing this out of proportion.Now that The Walking Dead is waning on TV, maybe Tinseltown can use this to replace it!"
I am elderly and have a weak chest and can catch infections easily so I have cancelled my train journey to London.Can I claim on my insurance or credit card for fear of coronavirus
"Linda, post 47. No chance! Disinclination to travel is not a ground for making an insurance claim.I see from your reviews you have been to Spain and Greece in the last two years. How did you cope with being cooped up on the plane?Edited: 9:44 am, February 14, 2020 "
I think you should have checked the insurance (non coverage) before taking the step of cancellation. Also perhaps you could say more about where you are going in London which you think is risky (the train journey itself is no more risky than taking any train - or bus/car/taxi - journey anywhere in the country
"14 cases in the US and 9 in UK, so you are probably better off coming here than staying in the USA"
Sadly not Linda.
"14 cases in the US and 9 in UK, so you are probably better off coming here than staying in the USA—————-That’s not a statistically sound conclusion to draw."
And no one needs to fear going to any hospital in the US and not getting whatever medical care they require regardless of their ability to pay. Wherever did you get that outlandish notion.
@54 I know there are different figures for medical bankruptcies in America - but regardless of which ones you opt for they are all pretty high. So why wouldnt someone fear they couldnt pay for medical care?

"You will receive top notch, no holds barred, world class care in any hospital. There are debates however on who should pay for this health care. There are those who feel it should be ""free."" ...and they are entitled to it. There are others who feel their health and paying for it is at least part of their personal responsibility. Your care will not suffer in the least even if you do not have anything."
"Uninsured citizens may receive world class medical treatment but they can also easily end up bankrupt once they get the bill. Hence, many people don't get care at all, even simple preventative care because the costs are so prohibitive. There are places that won't give you the same quality of care without health insurance or proven ability to pay for services.I recently had to visit an ER visit for a gash in my forehead, to be sure I didn't need stitches. They gave me a tetanus shot, some antibiotic ointment and a band-aid. I have good insurance coverage and was still billed $950 (that's £798! Luckily, I was able to pay without it impacting my finances in a horrific way. Not everyone is so lucky. I think you are being a bit naive here.Edited: 3:31 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"You, I and others here see this for what it is...a chance for an off topic slap at competing health systems and opportunity to wedge in a political dig or two. But truthful info is important here. Others reading this who are not as perceptive may interpret such comments as implying a person getting ill would not be afforded top quality care or turned away because they cant afford it. Who pays for it is an entirely different debate. I would not expect taxpayers from another nation to pick up my medical bills merely because I became ill or was injured on their soil."
"'Your care will not suffer in the least even if you do not have anything.' The respected Annals of Internal Medicine disagrees https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2635326/r…'They gave me a tetanus shot, some antibiotic ointment and a band-aid. I have good insurance coverage and was still billed $950 (that's £798!)' That was your charge with insurance coverage? Good grief."
"Yes, that's what I had to pay out of pocket. It's ridiculous! I can't imagine the stress of not having coverage and accumulating medical bills that I can't pay. It's a horrific situation for many Americans."
It is (wrongly) assumed by many in Europe that tourists will get turned away from the Emergency room of a US hospital unless they show they have the means to pay and/or insurance.I also suspect that many Americans (again wrongly) think our medicine is socialized and that we don't pay a penny when of course it is paid for by our national insurance and taxes.
"As I understand it, being in hospital isn't going to cure coronavirus, but the cost of your treatment, isolation etc. might be pretty high. Would you or your insurers be charged in the USA, because I would have thought there's a pretty high incentive to keep it to yourself, with potentially devastating consequences?(Genuinely not trying to make any point here. Just interested to know.)"
"Mchiddy, was % of the overall bill was your £800? I have just checked the price of a tetanus jab at Superdrug - £32. Plus 5p for the plaster, £1 for the ointment so I hope you had a troupe of dancers and a jazz band to entertain you while you waited and to justify that cost."
"Unfortunately, I didn't get any dancing doctors :( Just a bigger headache! lol"

"It's now confirmed that the coronavirus has been present in London for atleast the past week, in two different confirmed infected people. And I daresay these two people are just the tip of the iceberg.One of these attended at conference in London attended by over 200 people. In all likelihood she used the underground transport network to get around in London (we all do) and frankly it's unlikely she hasn't passed the infection on to many other people here. The second confirmed infected person we know little about, except for the fact that she is a Chinese national who flew to London four days before presenting herself at Lewisham Hospital in South London due to her symptoms. That's four days opportunity to spread the infection in London, not to mention the flight she flew in on and her fellow passengers on that. How many have been infected from these two people alone no one can know, of course. How many others are here spreading it independently of those two confirmed cases? Again no one knows.Our government has not stopped incoming flights from China - and anyway a British businessman caught it at a conference in Singapore, way ahead of these two cases and brought it home.It is of note that being symptomatic is irrelevant; that British man is known as the ""superspreader"" infected his family and friends a week or two before having any symptoms himself. The virus is here in London. Many Londoners probably have it by now and that will surely only increase dramatically due to the sheer volume of people in London and way we travel here; in close proximity to each other on public transport - something not really commonly done in the USA, with the exception of cities such as New York. You are right to exercise caution. I will be very surprised if hundreds of thousands aren't ill with the virus in London by mid March. Once it starts spreading here, there will be no stopping it and really it will be a miracle if none of those infected here already have not passed it on. And rest assured, there will be more infected incoming too, given that flights continue.In your situation I would not travel here. I'd avoid crowds anywhere, but especially in places - moreover, cities - where the virus is confirmed as present. It will be impossible to avoid crowds in London unless you plan to stay in your hotel room for the duration of your stay.If you are infected though, you will likely recover, though I'm not sure China is being honest about the numbers of those dead from the virus. If they are? 2% of those infected so far have died.Edited: 8:21 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"That's 2% of those *known* to be infected. It doesn't account for people who do not get seriously ill and so do not seek medical care. If those people are included, the fatality rate is likely to be much lower."
"'I will be very surprised if hundreds of thousands aren't ill with the virus in London by mid March.' Is that right. Tell us about your experience with infectious diseases and epidemiology.'Once it starts spreading here, there will be no stopping it and really it will be a miracle if none of those infected here already have not passed it on. And rest assured, there will be more infected incoming too, given that flights continue.' There's nothing like putting spin on something to make it more frightening.For balance, here's the latest from the WHO about COVID-19 https:/…For those who are immunosuppressed or have other comorbidities COVID-19 remains a potential problem, but for many others it could mean not much more than coryzal symptoms. Good hand hygiene is still advisable for everyone."
"""for many others it could mean not much more than coryzal symptoms""The flu is worse than that this year. At least around here a lot of people have a lot of vomiting and diarrhea too. Pretty miserable. No one seems to be panicking about that though..."
"I have a trip planned and booked already for March 20th and I’m dealing with the same thoughts, London is so crowded and even with preventive measures it still seems like a big risk, what I’ve decide to do is let it play out a few weeks and see what happens, if it is spreading I’m going to make arrangements to go to a less populated area in England."
"You're right, btgm, but the influenza A last year was a bad one as well, with plenty of people laid low by it through late April into early May.The advantage - if that can be said of it - of influenza is that it does respond to antivirals if caught and treated early whereas COVID-19 does not. And as COVID-19 is still new with a steep learning curve the milder symptoms in some who've contacted it will make it harder to pinpoint. As with influenza some of those who've been affected by this virus won't have sought medical attention, making identification of milder cases problematic as well."
"Re #63: Under federal law US hospitals are required to treat all who need emergency care, regardless of ability to pay. However, once the patient is ""stable"" hospitals have no further responsibility, though I don't know how many actually throw people out. A question that comes up from time to time on NYC forum is ""will immigration refuse to let me in because I didn't pay my hospital bill from last trip?"" and the answer to that is no, they will not, at least the way things are now, refuse to let you in. However, the bar brawl that was the reason for the trip to the ER might complicate things, so would need to do some research on that."
"To get back to the original question, yes, you have reason to be concerned. I think the greatest impact on travel now is in Asia and in the cruise business, but that could change if the virus appears with greater frequency in other parts of the world. As we have seen in Asia, people have suddenly found themselves having to rebook flights home because their original carrier has dropped the route. Others have been suddenly quarantined on cruise ships and elsewhere. There are Americans currently quarantined in the US because they traveled from affected areas. When hospitals are mobbed with people who think they have the virus, there may be a shortage of staff to deal with other medical issues. If the local US embassy/consulate is busy dealing with a major crisis or, worse, has been evacuated, they may not be able to promptly deal w/some problem you have, like a lost or stolen passport.So I would just wait and see and then decide how comfortable you are with traveling. Also, if you haven't already done so, get a regular flu shot. This is a bad flu season and the last thing you'd want to have happen would be to catch a nasty case of regular flu from someone on your flight and have THAT ruin your trip.Many years ago, at the beginning of the first Gulf War, my late parents had a trip to somewhere in Europe planned. They canceled it at the last minute, not because they were concerned about their own well-being or things like terrorist attacks, but because they didn't feel right about it, didn't think they could enjoy themselves while we were at war and ""young people were putting their lives on the line"" (these were people who lived through WWII). So everybody just has to decide for themselves what feels right."
"It seems that delegates flying in to London for conferences could be at risk.Not only could hundreds of thousands be infected, one scientist , whilst not predicting , as said in a Channel 4 interview that 400,000 fatalities is possible.He said he would rather over react than under react.https:/…"

"Just dont take any chinese medicine, that could be one of the reasons the outbreak started and why it has been worse in China. The animal they think transmitted it to humans is used in Chinese medicine.The average person with this virus spreads it to just over 2 people. The ""superspreader"" in Brighton did not give the virus to his wife and children. Of the first 1000+ tests in the uk 9 came back positive, they have all recovered. None of the Brits shipped out of the centre of the outbreak had contracted the virus. Just a few facts to counterbalance the panic over-reaction, this virus is probably less dangerous than flu.I'm at high risk - I'm still travelling to London this spring. I may use buses instead of the tube. If I have to use the tube I'll be washing my hands as soon as possible after I get off.

"We're also going to London in March with our children, one of whom is medically fragile + complex with life-limiting illness, multiply + profoundly disabled. Of course this trip was booked l-o-n-g before COVID-19. I plan on taking disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer, and masks on the plane before I let me child on (needless to say we always preboard), wiping down the seats / armrests, etc. If this kiddo will let me put a mask on them (understandably they don't like things on their face) then I'll pop that sucker on.But I'm also counting on what every other traveler counts on: the good sense of their fellow traveler!Sure, there are some entitled knuckleheads who won't think once let alone twice about traveling with communicable illness, but I'm going to cross my fingers and carry those clorox wipes!"

However all of the people travelling on her flight and all those attending the meeting will have been traced and tested but what about all the people they came into contact with ? It's like a ball of string, unravelling bit by bit ,not known for sure and certain how long the incubation period is  Whoever says "":it's just the flu "" needs to be understanding that the symptoms are far worse in some people leading to inflammation in the lungs and severe respiratory problems."

"“ Watching the news and the empty city in Italy scared me. I really want to go to London but now I am wondering what it would be like in the next couple weeks in London”Angela,What has Italy got to do with London? The virus might just as easily spread to wherever you live as to London."
"If the virus spreads to where you live you do what you have to. If local attractions are closed it's not too much of an inconvenience. If the virus spreads to where you are on holiday, your holiday is ruined. All the things you were going to do are off limits."

Hi Angela unfortunately no-one can tell you how things will evolve or what the issues may be. At the moment From a tourism’s point of view all is carrying on as normal although of course people are aware.However vacations are supposed to be enjoyable and if you feel visiting may be stressful for you and your family then the best thing may be to cancel the trip. Not sure who you are travelling with but what is their view? So they feel similar to you? Hope you can come to a decision you are comfortable with.

"Regardless of this particular Virus, these Cruise Ships are floating Petri Dishes already."
"Could someone explain how people can be effectively quarantined in their cabin on a cruise ship, supposedly isolated from other passengers, also in their respective cabins, when (I imagine) the air conditioning system for the ship is busily pumping air (full of the virus) from one cabin to another ?"
"No signs of London being any less busy than usual people continue to go about their daily lives, visit attractions and restaurants etc. It’s good you are apparently feeling less scared."
"Angela, post 103: Do you suffer from asthma or diabetes, or very elderly? If you can answer no then you are not high risk. If you do get coronavirus, the vast majority make a full recovery quickly.I am going on a cruise in a month's time. I could have cancelled it two weeks ago at no cost to myself but without hesitation I did not."
"I'm not minimizing the Coronavirus but I think we need some perspective. So far this flu season in the US, Oct to Feb, 12,000 people have died and close to 300,000 have been hospitalized and millions have been infected. This is according to the CDC. This is sort of an average flu season.We all need to be wise and do what we can to stay safe and healthy but not let it overtake our lives.Just my 2 cents."
"Coronavirus may be a much smaller risk to your health than flu, but potential precautions against coronavirus are a much greater risk to a holiday than flu is.And this is a travel forum, not a health forum."
"What is certain is that Covid-19 is far LESS dangerous than SARS. Even if you take the worst case estimates the former is half as dangerous as SARS. If you take the best case estimates (ie ignoring Wuhan) then Covid-19 is as dangerous as flu.And unlike flu, Covid-19 does not easily infect children which is a great relief considering they are normally one of the main ways of spreading disease"
"I agree with dewy @#117Having been on a few cruises and experienced Novovirus and all its trimmings it didn’t lead to the whole ship being confined to cabins or kept on board for a couple of weeks after the holiday has finishedHygiene on board has increased over the years but a cruise liner with a couple of thousand people on board , many of whom are a bit blasè when it comes to hand washing , becomes an incubator.Now I am not overly worried about contracting the virus but would hate having an “ extended holiday” spent in quarantine should some fellow passenger tests positive .Edited: 2:06 pm, February 25, 2020 "

"< This virus is extremely contagious, has a 2% death rate (regular flu is .1%) >You better have a word with Chad Wolf."
You are veru much blowing it out of propprtion. The chances of catching corona virus in London is very small. You might want to post this in the China forum the people posting on that forum might have a better idea as to what is realy going on there.
"Ah well, if someone's brother is an epidemiologist then we must all immediately cancel our holidays.(By the way, my sister is a dietician and SHE said you should all stop eating so much sugar)."
We are all aware aren't we that 3000 people have died of flu in the UK this Winter and that there is not much other news since Brexit?
"More people have died in the floods than from coronavirus because the current uk death rate from that is nil. 3 people died in storm Dennis.Any sensible epidemiologist says this (taken from published article) ""At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude [...]A precise estimate of the case fatality rate is therefore impossible at present. ""Of the people on the cruise ship - an elderly and therefore high risk population - quite a few tested positive but had no symptoms, some reports put this at half of those affected. If you are 80+ stay home, get your groceries delivered and keep away from anyone likely to be a risk. If you are under 50 it's being blown out of all proportion. In between 50 and 80 - depends on how risk averse you are."
Interesting suggestion on the TV - use contactless cards rather than cash to pay for things to reduce touching something that may be infectedPresumably you shouldn't also take the receipt and use self check-outs
It’s pointless guessingIt’s pointless comparing the cause of deaths More people die in road accidents and from heart attacks but we know and accept those risks every day This is different and new That’s all and until it gets worse and then gets better people will remain jittery This time next year it will all be behind us
"""...Interesting suggestion on the TV - use contactless cards rather than cash to pay for things to reduce touching something that may be infected...""But if you pick up a tin of something or a loaf of bread in the supermarket, how do you know that someone hasn't touched that before?How do you know that someone hasn't coughed or sneezed all over a contactless payment terminal before using it?I think this whole thing is getting blown out of all proportion."
"'This virus is extremely contagious, has a 2% death rate (regular flu is .1%)' Hmm.https:/… This suggests that the 2018 - 2019 influenza A - and a nasty thing it was - wreaked a fair bit of havoc compared to COVID.COVID-19 is a new pathogen with a steep learning curve about its functionality. That a number of people will have contracted the virus and been ill to some extent but not enough to seek medical attention is a given, and as such those people will be left out of the statistics which can skew the morbidity rate.It's late to try and contain the outbreak and as such basic hygiene measures still hold as a first line way most of us can reduce the risk."

"If you do decide to go, please come back and give us updates as we will be traveling in less than 2 weeks. Thanks!"
My concern is not catching the virus but the government may suddenly close key tourists areas like the Tower of London or galleries or museums. Low risk but would be a major bummer.
"London, and the rest of the UK, is almost as normal. And the virus is under much better control than appears to be the case in the US."
"I doubt if the Tower would be closed because a lot is outdoors. I guess it's possible they might close off the Crown Jewels and maybe limit entry to some attractions so they were less crowded. If London feels like too much risk it's always possible to head out of London and enjoy our beautiful countryside. Personally I'm pretty high risk (age and other conditions) and risk averse - so I've postponed plans to book a trip to New Zealand flying via South Korea. and am not booking other trips we'd considered like Thailand Still went to London and Winchester recently and may head off to Cornwall soon.

'What are the procedures at the Heathrow Airport? Any updates of what is actually happening might be helpful.' After disembarking the plane a walk to passport control. If eligible to use the e-gates then do so - takes about a minute - then walk to the baggage hall.From the baggage hall walk through the green channel of customs and out of the sterile area. The only notable thing today was fewer people at T3 waiting for arriving passengers. I saw no ore than two or three mask-wearing people on the Tube and several bus rides.
"Is it true you get charged if quarantined in the States, but it's free in the UK?"
The whole thing is a tricky one because there aren't enough people unwell to make anything standard or put practises in place.Certainly there doesn't seem to have been arriving tourists taken ill. It's mostly Uk residents returning from holidays in northern Italy or Asia in a set time when this was unexpected so the situation is different.
"Vigaz, I’m from McKinney area too! Will report back on our trip we are due to leave 3/6-3/16. Fingers crossed."
"We are scheduled to fly from JFK to LHR on April 3rd. Then Eurostar to Paris, flight to Milan and trains to Venice, Florence and Rome. Returning flight from Rome to JFK on April 21st.

Trying to hold on before cancelling, it’s daughter’s b-day trip, but everyday seems less likely that we are going to be able to make this trip. Right now there’s not much to be done, so hoping for the best."
"I would continue your plans for London and Paris and just spend more time in those cities and skip Italy. With today's news that they are shutting down all schools country wide, I wouldn't take the risk of traveling there any time in the near future. London isn't anywhere near the panic stage *yet*."
"Ayesha, may your trip go off without a hitch. I hope you have a great time. I’d appreciate any updates you can share while you are traveling. My flight is for March 22nd, and I am holding out a bit of hope that I can still go."
We are scheduled to fly to London on the 20th with our 12 year old and 21 year old daughters. We were then going to fly to Paris for 4 days and return to London for the second half of our trip. At this point I'm really not sure what to do. I posted on the Paris forum about it but I'm very conflicted. I do think that for healthy individuals who are not immune compromised or older it seems not to be so serious. But there is just so much we don't know. It makes sense to minimize the risk of exposure by avoiding crowded places - but of course we don't want to travel to Europe and stay in our hotel room. We would also hate to be sick on vacation or face a quarantine abroad or on our return. At this point we are leaning towards cancelling. Our flights were $550 round trip so if we need to cancel it's not ideal but not a tragedy. We cancel our hotel up until 3/19 so for now we are watching and waiting!
Thanks Kathy will do. From what I’ve been told it’s the same as it is here in the US. My husband will bring his work laptop in case we are quarantined - at least I’ll have a longer “vacation” ;)

"This isn't London related, but more general concerning the Covid-19 virus. We've been travelling - it's great time to travel if you don't like crowds, by the way - and we've had our temperatures taken many, many times in airports and in hotels. What happens if you are running a fever? Where do they take you? To a facility filled with others who have fevers?"
"'Single figures last Friday, now in treble figures. Number of cases doubled in two days.' Not surprising as more people are being tested and with that the number of persons who've been in contact with the virus will continue to rise at least in the short term. Having said that, an increase in the number of persons who've contracted Covid does not mean an increase in the severity of the illness after contact.'What happens if you are running a fever? Where do they take you? To a facility filled with others who have fevers?' The answer to both is this: it depends.Being febrlle is not necessarily indicative of having contacted Covid-19. If a person was found to be febrile the next thing that should happen is a history taken as well as viral swabs to determine what may be going on."
"Our next trip is to Uganda and South Africa. While there are very few reported cases of Covid-19 south of the Sahara, I understand that screenings are taking place at the international airports. My wife is particularly concerned that should either of us develop a fever we'll be dragged into a facility that is not up to what we've come to know as standard."
You could take your own thermometer with you on the trip? That way you can at least know you have a temperature way before you're at the airport...
"Well,I do think this should be viewed realistically.In the UK,see have had one death,a lady in her 70's, with previous ongoing health problems.What's the recovery rate? Above 98%.It may be a problem for those who may already be susceptible to infuenza."

"Being British Asian, I've been told that wearing a mask will make you a target for racist abuse or even worse, can anyone shed any light on this? As photos I've seen there's been masks worn by all ethnicites, altho this is what I've heard. Thanks————————-I have seen one report of an attack on a Singaporean tourist by some teenagers. There are also reports of Chinese restaurants suffering from a lack of patrons.Every village has its idiots I’m afraid."
I don't believe the young man who was attacked was wearing a mask and as those masks offer little if any protection I just don't understand why people wear them.I appreciate it's a cultural thing in parts of Asia but you won't find that many people wearing them in the UK.
"To be honest, reading the UK govt’s very informative action plan ( including its reasoning, preparations for Contain, Delay, Mitigate strategy) and my own governments’s difficulties tracking infected tourists amongst 300,000 arriving for the Grand Prix next week, I’, starting to think the responsible thing for travellers to do is stay at home. More people mean more opportunities for the virus to spread both locally and at home if you’re unlucky enough to pick it up while away. Already corporates have banned international travel and are readying to work from home, presumably to protect workers but also to aid the combat effort by not contributing further people into the crowd.This is quite apart from the prospect of being quarantined in a hotel for two weeks, far from home and in many cases without travel insurance to cover it. Local governments have enough on their hands without me further contributing to it. Much as it pains me, I think I cancellation is the responsible thing to do ( due to travel late April). Will wait for a miracle but can’t see how it’s physically possible."

Maybe they only schedule maintenance when they know I'm coming!).I saw more people in Prague wearing face masks than I have seen in Liverpool, where mainly Chinese students wear masks. But they wear masks even when there isn't a nasty virus going around!"

"""Scotland Women's Six Nations match against France has been postponed after a Scottish player tested positive for coronavirus. Scotland returned from northern Italy on February 23 after their Six Nations match was postponed following an outbreak in the region"" So unless someone in the team goes down with coronavirus and at least some of the rest are told to self isolate for a time matches are going ahead. Those at high risk are being advised to avoid crowds though.Panic over the virus - and misinformation about it - are rife. The World Health Organisation say that it is largely transmitted in family clusters. If you are from a culture that kisses people on the cheek best to stop doing so. Our newspapers manage to find a few pictures of people wearing masks - just the one in a tube carriage.If I was under 50 I would be taking advantage of cheap flights and cheap hotels - the illness is usually mild for that age group and you cant live your life being frightened of shadows. Since I'm high risk I have postponed plans to fly to New Zealand via Seoul. Anyone with a fever is likely to be offered treatment, not necessarily in hospital."

Between what the media is reporting, reading comments in forums like this and advise from family, this is a very conflicting situation."
"#202 - Yuri - AFAIK the reported cases in Greater Manchester upto yesterday were all from the outer boroughs, none were from the city itself. At the moment I haven't seen whether they have reported the location of any new cases announced today.

"Yuri, Bella’s point at #223 is the one to watch. The expectation is that at some point following it (possibly not immediately but perhaps to coincide with Wednesday’s Budget) the government is going to officially accept we’ve moved from “contain” to “delay”. That is likely to mean the cancellation of large public gatherings.Just as I write that sentence, the news on the radio has discussed precisely that option as its lead story. That suggests to me that journalists have been briefed this is the likely outcome. So I think the prospects for your concerts are not good, but you should know within a couple of days."

Brymac: You'd probably be better off posting in the Russian and South Korean forums to get a feel of the situation in those countries first hand as that is where it sounds like you'll be spending the majority of your time.I went on the Trans-Mongolia from Beijing to Europe (getting off at a number of places in Russia and Mongolia along the way) about 10 years ago and it was probably the best traveling experience of my life. I hope you're able to go. It's a fantastic journey.

"Hi,I have been into London twice in the last three days. It was as busy as usual, but the situation is still developing with infections rising in the UK as elsewhere in the world, so this could change very soon. Things are normal on the surface, but the lack of hand sanitizer is causing a lot of stress for many here! Goodness knows when it will be back in stock. If visiting, bring your own!Btw: You won't see British people wearing masks, not necessarily because we are not worried about the virus, but because masks are not widely available for purchase to the general public at the best of times, due to lack of demand. Now, they are impossible to find. In addition, due to the lack of cultural acceptance of mask wearing in the UK, those that have managed to buy them will wait until they think it's an absolute emergency before bringing them out!Good luck to those faced with having to decide to come or cancel, whatever you decide.:)"
"I’m pretty sure that Premier Inn don’t buy their loo rolls in Tesco. The current issue is with supply, not production so the company with the contract to supply the PI chain won’t be running out."
The main reason masks aren’t being worn in the U.K. is not cultural it’s because they are not effective - they are useless against virus. They might stop droplets from coughs and sneezes.
Hand sanitiser and loo roll are available here. There's nothing wrong with stocks. Just people going daft!You can wash your hands (are people alergic to that) and I've made my own. I trust it more.What is it with toilet paper? The virus is a cough and sore throat. Makes you wonder.

"I’ll be checking it with them. It is very basic Master Card insurance. I’ll see what can be done, but something is telling me, I’ll be loosing on some technicality.Yuri."
Almost certainly your insurance will try and wriggle out of it. Good luck.Im currently on the hook for a some thousands of pounds for a holiday to the States in April. Best thing at this point would be for the airline to cancel.
"#247 Yuri - very sorry to learn that your trip cannot go ahead. Inevitable decision by your country, wholly understandable IMO.It will surprise me if The Who gig, that we coincidentally had both booked to attend at Manchester Arena, will actually go ahead (large gathering for 3+ hours and indoors). Enjoyable as it would have been, health aspects are more important."

Caylan Yes they might stop large droplets from coughs and sneezes from the person wearing the mask and that might help to some extent.But the virus is small enough to pass through the mask rendering them useless Even if you are wearing a mask over your nose and mouth the virus can enter your body via your eyes.If a person who has Coronavirus is wearing a mask then the mask becomes contaminated . How will they dispose of a used mask ? Chuck it in a bin? Touch it with their hands then touch other surfaces.The discarded masks could spread contamination to others if not disposed of correctly.This is from virologists who have stated that the “ paper” masks are ineffective. Hope this helps

"As soon as the masks get damp they are useless. Those unused to wearing masks are likely to fiddle with them so touching their face with potentially contaminated hands more often. I prefer to put my faith in the Chief Medical Officer here than in the WHO.Cases here are rising but currently at a rate that suggests it's those returning from Italy and their family contacts rather than widespread transmission. So concerts in the next few days may go ahead but I wouldnt count on Glastonbury. As for the toilet roll panics - one near me but shops 15 minutes drive away had plenty in stock. Coronavirus joke - toilet rolls may be sold out but cat litter isnt, you know what you have to do :)"
"Yuri - have you contacted Easyjet to cancel your flights?You might even get a partial refund like we did when my dad was booked to fly with them to Belfast.I wasn't even expecting a refund, but the lady at Easyjet that I spoke to asked: ""Is there a reason for the cancellation?""

They’ve provided a link from the UK Government website advising to self isolate if returning from certain countries, the hotel has advised those effected to not check into the hotel.They’ve also asked future guests to check the website as it’s updated on a regular basis.I’m coming to London unless the Canadian Government sends out a travel advisory. Luckily for me my company is flexible and will allow me to work from home as I self isolate upon my return. Canada has cases coming from everywhere including the US. I did take out both trip cancellation and interruption insurance, and medical insurance when I booked my holiday."
"#258 and #261, your explanations about face mask being useless against this virus make sense. This is in fact what many of the medical experts in the U.S. said.What I cannot understand is, then why do every medical worker is wearing a face mask from all the news pictures we have seen? Are all these medical workers sick and afraid of spreading to others? Just curious.Edited: 8:49 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Caring for a patient is considered close contact. So it's recommended for healthcare workers to wear masks. Also gowns, face shields, and gloves. The patients are also supposed to be wearing masks. However, the healthcare workers receive training on how to remove the masks and they are not supposed to be wearing them all day. They are supposed to wear them into the room with the patient and then remove them when they come out, discard them, and use a new mask the next time. (Although since people who don't need them keep buying them, healthcare workers in some places are having to reuse them, increasing their risk of becoming infected. Something the panic buyers are either not considering or don't care about.)And health care workers are not supposed to be using surgical masks with high risk patients. They are supposed to be using N95 respirators or PAPR/CAPR devices. This recommendation is changing though as they think that the novel coronavirus is actually transmitted by droplets and not aerosolized. In that case surgical masks are acceptable.Edited: 10:58 pm, March 10, 2020 "

Several million people live and work in London every day. It hasn't become a ghost town. Life is more or less as usual.Wash your hands thoroughly often is the best advice.I would imagine London is no more vulnerable to where you live....
"It is expected that cases here will start to take off here soon, maybe even today - latest estimate is that it will peak at Easter."
"I agree buzzard , people have been blasè at times with the “ life goes on” “ not as bad as flu” “ more chance of getting killed in a road collision” thinking.The reality is that an unknown number of infected people, granted a small percentage of total population, have been circulating for several days maybe weeks who whilst not showing any symptoms are nevertheless contagious.A Govt Minister and one of her assistants as tested positive in the last day or two.It will be interesting to see how many MPs are in the Chamber for the budget today."
I agree with 272 & 273. Perhaps we need to move away from consideration of our own safety and convenience into thinking about how our own actions might contribute to the spread of the virus. It seems fairly obvious that the more people move around the further/quicker this will spread.
"We must be in the blasé group (even though we are considered more vulnerable, being over 60).I think the only reason it's been blown out of proportion is economic - not a bad thing at all!"

"My take is that, aside from the obvious ""hot spots"" where the COVID-19 is really exploding, it's not the ""being"" somewhere that is the risk as much as the ""getting"" there. Airplanes, especially big ones, and cruise ships are your key danger of infection vectors, not walking the streets of London. Can you get there without joining hundreds of random folks in the process? Go to it. Otherwise, forewarned is forearmed."

"Thanks for the update, KWUK.Just yesterday, See Tickets have turned me down, by telling me that my ticket was “non refundable”. Apparently, it was my Mrs who booked it with PayPal. After their refusal, she opened a case in PayPal. I’ve received my £108 this morning.Most wonderful people are working at the Barbican Centre box office. I had a ticket booked for the Academy of Ancient Music concert: Handel’s Heroines. A two minutes long conversation over the phone, and I saw my £38 refunded.My beloved Premier Inn - zero consideration, Virgin Trains - same, Ticketline ( Van Morrison gig in London Palladium ) - very same.Most outrageous were EasyJet. These guys are offering to reschedule my flights to later dates, while charging 43$ per change. As if business is usual for them...Yuri."
"I’m in London right now, should I return back to the US tomorrow? I know the ban is not for citizens but things seem to be changing rapidly. Delta isn’t even picking up over 6 hours hold time."
On what date were you due to fly back?
Monday March 16th
"Well there's no way to be 100% sure, but given that's only four days from now, I'd suspect that your flight will be ok and you'll return home without any problems. Maybe you'll even have a few extra seats to lay down on."
If you are still enjoying your holiday I would wait and get your scheduled flight.Your decision though.
"10 Feb 2020, 02:00Have a 5 day trip planned for mid March#1 I think you are blowing it way out of proportion.#2 You are blowing it out of proportionHow easy it is to be wise with hindsight. One month on, the question looks damn sensible and I, in post 9, can receive flak as well."
Yeah I think we are leaning towards finishing or trying to get a flight out sat or Sunday. The thought of packing 5 people’s belongings in the next few hours freaks me out. Plus I haven’t had my afternoon tea yet lol.
"Old Vic Theatre visit this afternoon. Theatre half full due to cancellations. I was upgraded from the Upper Circle to the most expensive part of the Stalls, due to my recent worsening restricted mobility issues, which have got worse since I bought the ticket last November.Pub, afterwards, empty. Waterloo station relatively quiet to what I am used to seeing. Many seats on a train towards Reading at 17.50, really unusual.I hope, if people can get back home easily, that they will come to London.Finally, I chatted at length to a youngish Norwegian lady who is due to be in London until Friday. She hasn't been told to leave London early but she has been told that she must self-isolate, for a fortnight, as soon as she arrives home, even if she has no symptoms. Just an exampleAnthony"
I have a trip scheduled for end of April and will be going unless they ban travel from Canada lol... I know that it's sensitive times right now but I'm hoping by then it'll blow over.
"jdeezul... blowing over by April, sorry, it will not.In the UK, not taking punitive measures, such as closing Theatres, with large numbers attending, as just one example, will in part, push back the UK reaching it's Peak of Cases 'til the Summer and thus delay rather than contain the spread properly.Anthony K"
What evidence do you have to support that statement?
"@ Arm rest dominance.Evidence of delay?Her Majesty’s Government is trying to flatten the bell curve spike of new cases to try to prevent a spate that would overwhelm the health services and cause wider disruption in the workplace and of course travel.Evidence? Try this https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-…So if this goes to plan then it’s not going to be over in a few weeks.Travel disruption will be affected for months with people cancelling, being advised not to go, deciding not to chance it, and obviously some being too ill to go."
"Yuri, you’ve probably now received the email Easyjet sent to all customers saying they are waiving the rescheduling fees. I dn’t have any outstanding flights and I still got one.I think the UK has just been more realistic about the length and spread of this than most countries, who are still in a “contain” mentality. Basically, we are all going to get exposed to it sooner or later, and they just want to push that into the Spring and Summer, and take the drastic action then. There’s no need to stabilize it at current levels, we’re better off carrying on and not bringing the country to a standstill until we have to."
Informative news conference about how the UK is managing the timing of coronavirus transmission...https://www.bbc.com/news/av/health-51862922/…It's about 4 and a half minutes long but watching the first 2 and a half minutes would probably suffice for those short on time.
"Astolat, I’ve received no such email. My flight is scheduled this Sunday.EasyJet know that I’m Israeli national. By them, there’s nothing stopping me from flying. My future mandatory 14 days long quarantine ( if I choose to fly ) isn’t their concern. Very cynical attitude. Unfortunately, my Israeli insurance company is sticking to same logic.Yuri."
"Hi Yuri ,Try going to “ Manage my Bookings “This is the giste of the email“Given the unprecedented situation we’re all facing as a result of Covid-19, we wanted to provide an update on what this means for any travel plans you may have with easyJet. We will continue to operate a flight schedule that ensures that those customers who still wish to travel can do so, where travel restrictions allow and in line with guidance from health authorities. However, we understand there is uncertainty around travel at this time, so if you currently have a booking with us but would prefer not to fly then from tomorrow (13.03.2020), you can now change your flight online and we will waive the flight change fee. This applies to all existing and new bookings until further notice. Should there be a difference in fare you’ll need to pay this - however by waiving the change fee, we want to ensure you have more flexibility to amend your travel plans.Where we’ve been required to cancel flights, customers will be able to transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a refund. And where all flights have had to be cancelled due to local authority guidance – in Italy, for example – we are operating rescue flights to ensure passengers can return home.To change your travel plans, please visit the Manage Bookings section on easyJet.com. This is not only the simplest way to make changes but, given the call volumes we are currently experiencing, this will also be the quickest"

"this is not going to be over by April. It may never be over but a virus we need to learn to live with/ develop treatments for.It is now mid March and the Op has decided to cancel. If they had not done so they would find a London that continues to go about it's business - but less crowded than usual.. They would probably have no greater risk of catching the virus in London than in America, unless they are locking themselves in when at home. Cases are rising in Florida and they have community transmission there. Yuri it may be which website you booked on - I had the e-mail from Easyjet too and I have no flights booked, I suspect they would like me to book some."
"Thank you very much everybody.I’ve received the message via my EasyJet App. They offer free rescheduling alright. My problem is: They can reschedule only until end of October. Ive got nothing to do in UK until the end of October. I’ll wait until 2.5 hours before my flight on Sunday. If they will cancel the flight - I’ll be receiving my refund. If they won’t - I’ll reschedule, and see what’s developing then.Things don’t look good here. Schools are shut, at least until the end of Passover. We’ve got 126 cases by now. Thanks God, no deaths.

Air Canada had already change their policy for my travel dates that would allow me.

"@Carol P Your first cases came from China. Once the virus was in America your poor medical care and your President's useless attitude to public health guaranteed that it would spread. Now you can can not control it so you have to focus on not spreading it to others. Americans who have visited Britain were probably more likely to bring the virus here than to pick it up here. Prayer may help those who pray feel better, if it is doing me no harm it's none of my business what someone else wants to do.

Yes interesting that on the 10 Feb the op had the forethought to ask this question but the Government has been caught with its pants down. How many weeks did they have to stockpile PPE but instead the NHS is relying on wickes bin bags and face masks and PPE from the sets of Holby City and Casualty.Also why did they nnot go to existing ventilator manufacturers to ramp up production rather than getting Dysen to design a completely new one?
"Interesting, Taiwan realised that they can put two pipes on one ventilator to look after two patients at the same time. I gather the NHS is now looking at that too.That will help considerably!"

Are you happy with the current situation with mediacl staff wearing bin bags?I watched Emily Mailtless interview and idiot from the Government after it was quite clear that having said how many ventilators the NHS had was not correct.It was very concerned that all the various Minsters might also be idiots.Suggesting we all rally around and hope for God's sake the Government know what they are doing doesn't cut it with me, I am afraid to say.Is there any plan as to what will happen in 2 weeks when the lock down ends as to what happens? Another 3 week lock down then another? I hope they have but I wouldn't like to guarantee it."
Listened as always to the news and UK gov press briefing tonight. Tbh anyone who thinks the UK is anywhere the near the peak of this in terms of either new cases or deaths is imo delusional or living in another universe. For two weeks now here in España we have not even been allowed to go outside for exercise. Only one person is allowed in a car to go shopping etc etc. Are we turning a corner yet.... if only!
"“the Government is largly run buy idiots”It is easy to be an armchair critic, isn’t it? I am just a receiver of information but I am happy to trust a government that acts on the advice of pre-eminent experts who have a sense of the wider picture and who are aware as much as anyone can be of how the virus might grow and subside."
"'I am happy to trust a government that acts on the advice of pre-eminent experts who have a sense of the wider picture and who are aware as much as anyone can be of how the virus might grow and subside.'I'd think the same, but with that one needs a government made up of intelligent persons who are willing to acknowledge what they do not know and who would be willing to be briefed by experts and understand that this is a fluid situation in which information today may be incorrect tomorrow and that trial and error still play a part in how we deal with the matters on a macro and micro level.With that I am minded of wretched Gove's comments 'I think the people in this country have had enough of experts, with organizations from acronyms, saying ... people from organizations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.' That someone with that mindset was in government is horrifying."
"Its ineresting to go back and read selection over the past month.Its the same on many other forum.We have gone from ""its all a hoax"" to ""the government is too weak"" pretty much in the shape of an exponential curve."
"Many of us here have family or friends scattered all over the globe, & have been exchanging emails etc. The evolving movement restrictions initially from China, then Europe, SEA, India, Canada & now the USA have informed our own individual decisions about self isolation ahead of the Gov't advice. Currently, we aren't in full ""lock down"" mode as experienced in China, Italy or Spain, but many here suspect this will happen very soon. The gov't may (within days) ban all flights into the UK, except for freight & repatriation purposes. For those of you still visiting London, you may wish to consider returning home. It's not that you aren't welcome, but your own families, friends & gov'ts may want you safely home. And this includes domestic travellers too."
Our government has been very clear. If you dont keep the rules you are not welcome.Prio to our current lockdown we had self isolation. Several travellers breaking those rules were deported.
"You, individually, must evaluate what is an essential or reasonable reason for leaving home, at the present time.If challenged by a friendly local Bobby, or whatever his or her name is, on the street or in a park, be prepared to be seen as guilty before you are presumed to be innocent. Also, be prepared to vocalise your ""reasonable excuse"" for being where you are ... I'm sure it's not enough to, simply, say - ""Well, officer, everyone has to be somewhere.""Finally, being vigilant about your personal hygiene is still paramount, as is retaining rude health, if possible, and guarding the well-being of your family and where you can neighbours and friends ... remember Skype and a thing called the Telephone can be used often...Keep well allAnthony KPS - I shall be out tomorrow morning, in Feltham High Street, shopping for essentials for myself and neighbours who are, rightly, self-isolating."
"""and a thing called the Telephone can be used often...""Yes try phone any business or organisation at the moment. OK if it is an 0800 number.The wait to the SSE call centre to question why they doubled the estimate of my electricity bill was an hour. I opted for an old fashioned letter. Ironically had they put a decent estimate together it wouldn't have been necessary to contact them at all.Just written to my local council as well on the basis that the switch board was probably jammed solid."
"Let's all take a deep breath, and realise that we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. Follow the rules, and keep safe.We will get through this.Edited: 4:50 pm, March 30, 2020 "
Please stay home.....
"""Please stay home ... "" - may be a heartfelt plea ...However, those of us without any Flu-like symptoms, myself included, may be justified in going out, now and again, to track down essential food and drink and medicines for our neighbours and close friends who are, correctly, self-isolating.I would like, also to pay a personal thank-you to all those who are keeping Public Transport operating and those doing deliveries, eg The Royal Mail.Keep well allAnthony K"

"'It costs Nothing to be Kind!!' I disagree. The 'cost' is that person A instructs person B to in essence 'do what I say - be kind' with the subtext that not being kind is bad/wrong/inappropriate/not what A wants and as such a terrible thing, how very dare you/your views and thoughts do not count.Person B's thoughts and speech are their own, not to be compelled by person A. As long as Person B accepts responsibility for what they say then their right to speak remains theirs rather than under the remit of Person A.Ideally many thoughtful people will understand that this is a lousy situation and we're in unknown and stressful times and act accordingly - but that doesn't mean others can compel speech or thoughts."
