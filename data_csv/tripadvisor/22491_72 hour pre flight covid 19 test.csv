"Someone else asked this similiar question and it was yet to be commented on. With having to have the Covid 19 test within 72 hours of boarding my Tahiti flight, how is anyone able to get this done?? Most test results are taking 3 to 5 days to come back. Im hoping this 72 hour rule changes. Bahamas is doing within atleast 10 days which is more reasonable!!"
"Air Tahiti Nui has a recommended clinic at LAX they have partnered with to provide results in 48 hours. They are open 24 hours. We are flying to LA and getting our tests done and spending a few extra days in California in order to make sure we get our tests done in time. Not possible for everyone, but it is an option."
"Thank you Matt, that is good to know."
"""10 days which is more reasonable.""10 days is actually idiotic considering you have 10 days to catch it after you test. 3 days is pushing it, and one would think rapid testing would be in place. Germany and other nations are offering up testing with a 3 hr wait for a fee. This makes much more sense."
"I agree, I feel like the best and most effective an accurate option would be if they had a proper and reliable rapid test option that could be done at the airport with a 3 to 5 hours TAT. It would be the most accurate way that would actually be helpful. I also agree that doing 10 days would make it pretty useless. As it is, 3 days is almost pretty much useless. Heck it's all pretty useless given you could catch it at the airport among others who don't need to test at all. It just helps in reducing the change but not by a whole lot."
"For a trip like this I would wait until things are in the clear. Imagine paying all that money and then you get tested and you have the virus, then what? Do you lose all your money or can you rebook for later?"
Jordan-My airbnb's are fully refundable and Air Tahiti Nui will redo my ticket if I or my son or wife test positive so there is flexibility at least for us.
We are going August 4th and are going to take our test on the 3rd. The place I called her connected to a big hospital said they get their results back in 24-48 hours. They said 72 hours was totally doable. Do we know if they are checking the results once we land in Tahiti? Or when you board to go there?Our daughter who lives in San Diego had a test down there and they returned her results in an hour.
Suel - were you still doing your test at Stanford express care in the Bay Area ? I leave on August 6th too and when I called them recently they said cos of the surge in cases in Santa Clara county they are taking 24-72 hours now .. ( as opposed to a month ago when they guaranteed 24-48)
Sue - also to answer your question they will check it before you board during check in. I confirmed this with ATN...
Jyotsnacs - oh wow really? I will have to call around. Our daughter took it about 2 weeks ago in San Diego and got her results right on the spot (maybe 45 minutes later!). I wonder if there is a place in the Bay Area that does that? Might need a quick flight to San Diego the day before....yikes!
Sue - Was her test an RT PCR test though ? Cos very rarely do RT PCR tests come back that quick ! I think there are many other rapid COVID tests that are available but since the tourism board specifically mentioned that ..
I don’t know how it works in the USA but in the UK we can pay privately to have the test done within 24 hours. Is this not an option for you guys??
Jyotsnacs - I am not sure. she went with her aunt. I will have to ask. I don't know the differences in the tests.
"Yesh24 - it depends on where you are but most places you can't get it within 24 hours. The RT PCR test use special equipment to analyze the test results. A few facilities have these around the country but for the majority of testing sites the test sample has to be couriered to a lab to be tested and usually takes 24-48 hours. In certain states, such as here in Oregon where I am at you CAN'T be tested at all if you don't have symptoms. Not even if you want to pay privately a doctor has to put in the referral which has to meet specific requirements such as showing a certain amount of the symptoms described by the CDC. You can purchase or get the antigen tests but not a RT PCR test. So it really depends on where the person lives in the US."
Yesh24- our daughter lives in San Diego and she paid $125 for a Sofia 2 SARS Antigen test down there and got the results in an hour. It was the type with the big swab up the nose but I don't know if it is the kind Tahiti accepts.
"Just visited my primary doctor today.They provide test and could get result back in two days. Also will set up the appointments for my three kids. The pediatrician told us to set up appointment when date get closer. Usually, they can get result back in two days, even can find out within hour with special requests. City MD provide test, but the result come out 3-5 days and there is no guaranteed.Good luck! Everyone!"
"They are supposed to check your test results before board. There was press conference today to announce the preventive measures. Visitors will also receive a self-test upon arrival, you will be required to test while in FP and the test will be delivered to the health dept."
The info here seems to be up to date and inline with what the President announced today: https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/.
"@Suel3754-Hello! I live in San Diego, can you find out where your daughter had her test done? thanks!Edited: 1:24 am, July 13, 2020 "
Hi Lori - I can find out where she took her test but I did find out it is NOT the kind that is required to travel to French Polynesia. The kind my daughter had is the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen test but you have to get a PCR type. She will be flying home 3 days before our trip so we can all get our tests together here.
"@suel3754-Thanks for letting me know! good luck w/testing and have a safe trip!Edited: 1:15 pm, July 15, 2020 "
Anyone on the east coast with experiences of getting results back in 72 hours somewhere? I’ce called around and many places use Quest which is taking 5-10 days.
I know a place in Manhattan - feel free to PM
"Hi,Where did you get the test done? in San Diego or in LA - place. thank you."
"I think this place does it in Southern California - https:/…Edited: 4:59 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"Hey just as a heads up, you have to provide the results of the test as you board the plane. Your best bet would be to get tested on august 1 if you are leaving on the 4th. Getting tested on the 3rd with them saying a 72 turn around time isn’t going to work. Just wanted to clarify for you!"
We are in the Bay area and would love any info you have on quick turnaround places - we have tickets to Hawaii in November.
@Tempeh Cowboy ArcPoint Lab Richmond has 48 hours guarantee. You can book online. I am going to do test tomorrow. We are going to fly this Saturday. Fingers crossed.https:/…
Hi everyone! Just got to LAX and wanted you to know that the GenX Lab test was accepted. No issues.
Hi Owen- I'm looking to do the test in NYC. What's your recommendation? Thanks!
"We have found a place in the U.S. to get a test result quickly, but I read that you have to test again in French Polynesia four days after arrival. We are going to Bora Bora, but does anyone know if they have a testing facility on that island? If the only acceptable testing facility is on Tahiti, then one would have to pay to fly back and get tested, effectively losing a day and at considerable expense."
"Martin they give you upon arrival in Tahiti a self test kit. On your 4th day you administer the test, put the swabs in the bag provided, and give it to the front desk of your hotel. It does not matter what island you are currently on at the moment. They will send it to the proper testing facility."
"I just found an answer on the tahititourisme.com website under the FAQ section/During Your Stay, that an envelope will be issued to each traveler to perform a self test that consists of an oral and nasal swab. If positive or symptomatic, you must report to officials."
I just found that info and thank you for the response.
