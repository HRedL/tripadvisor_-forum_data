I will be traveling with my family on June 12th to beautiful Ischia.I am wondering if anyone has had the Virus on the Island and if there is anyone with any advise?We are just praying that it dies off and that no more lives are taken...I have held off on canceling our Holiday in hopes that it will slow down...Thank you for any feedback.Happy Day!
"The problem is not just virus presence in destinations per se, especially in provincial areas far from isolated/quarantined zones (mostly in the North), but transiting through very crowded spaces, ie. airports, ferry and hydrofoils.I don't think there are cases at all on the island, but again the percentages of catching the virus there are extremely low. Also we don't know how the situation will evolve until June.You may want to wait as it's too soon to make any evaluation given your specific situation. Also Ischia is just perfect in June. Let's wait and hope for the better."
"This website will tell you what you need to know about cases on Ischia.There are no cases of coronavirus confirmed in Ischia, Italia, as of Tuesday, 10th of March 2020https:/…ischia"
"Hello I was wondering if you did get to go to Ischia in June?If so, how was it? And how was it getting to Naples (assume you flew), the ferries, etc?Can I ask where you stayed?My husband and I have been going to Hotel Vittorio on Maronti Beach for a decade, and I’ve often gone alone, especially in September. I hope you did get to go, and that it was a wonderful safe trip. Any info would be much appreciated. Thank you."
