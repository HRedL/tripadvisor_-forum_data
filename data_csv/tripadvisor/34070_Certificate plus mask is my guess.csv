Reading whats being put out in the Turkish media plus exchanging messages with Turkish friends my guess is that within x months they'll allow foreign tourists in providing they have a certificate that theyve tested negative for CO-19 and airlines will require compulsory wearing of masks on board.Sounds a little more positive.
Please do not start this certificate speculation again. There are some very good update threads on the main Turkey forum that have evidence based information with reliable sources linked to.People are trying to be positive by making some future plans. What isn’t needed is the “someone told me” type information that has no verifiable background whatsoever! Yes this is your guess but someone else may guess not.
"Things are depressing enough, this isn’t helpful at all."
"Agree, please stop speculating and wait for positive. factual information."
"I am not sure what’s the problem is with the OP The headline is “Certificate plus mask is MY GUESS “So it’s a opinion and what’s wrong with that ? As for frances janes comment “Agree, please stop speculating and wait for positive. factual information.”So when you say there will be no travel until there is a vaccine in another thread, is that not your opinion ? Because at this moment in time it certainly is not a factual information is it."
"OP has good reasons to for such a guess. Naimly, Austria is already requiring foreign visitors to via land to present a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular-biological SARS-CoV-2 test. And some airline companies in the States are starting to introduce ""wear a mask"" requirements on board. So it is not that much of a speculation, after all. Surely within same range as answering on what the weather will be in xyz location on 2nd week of month abc :-))"
"My intention was to offer some hope to people that holidays to Turkey could still happen this year, I’ve booked flights myself in fact. I took the info from sites that quote the Turkish authorities. It’s a safe bet masks will be compulsory on public transport. And I tagged the post guess ie it’s an opinion. Never mind perhaps I’ll keep quiet from now on.Used to enjoy coming on here but it seems it’s been turned into a pssng contest and spoilt by a few I know better than you types. Shame."
Too late to edit my previous post but could we please make sure any discussion about this is on one thread so any developments etc are all in one place. A similar thread is on the Antalya Forum as well......... https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g297…That way everything stays in one place and information doesn't get lost :o)
Unbelievable who made you the forum moderator VIP ?? You and your side kick are telling people what they can and can’t post ! Someone posted they got a refund the other day for a Premier Inn room and you jumped on that! Had you checked they do travel to Turkey ! Maybe a refund for a room for a cancelled holiday to Turkey.In “normal” times you were just the same. People don’t need scolding by you !! We might have lost our freedom to go where and when we like but as yet not our freedom of speech !
Sm69Yes I know you where offering a bit of hope and with all the bad news going around I am all for people’s opinion that are positivePlease don’t feel you can’t post on here
"sm96, i can assure you that many forum members would agree with your comments in post 6.Toady (post 9), thank you for saying what needed to be said !Stay safe everyone.Boyce99."
"It would just be nice to get back to exchanging views and advise on hotels again!Ive got loads of friends who work in the hotels in animation, bars, some shop owners all equally keen to see things get back to normal. I had a Whatsapp video call with a shop owner in Bekek this week and he said as early as June could be back open. Where theres a will... Im prepared for a bit of extra travel inconvenience and maybe a watered down AI experience but let's get back out in that Turkish sunshine and enjoy their warm hospitality asap. Theres some very cheap flights to be had for those prepared to take a gamble btw."
"and who made you the forum police Toady? I would just like to see discussions about one subject on one thread then if any important updates are announced they can be found easily. You really must be stalking the forums........ And you have never caused a 'discussion' or tried to tell people where to holiday??? Pot, kettle black."
"Sm69Yes I have had phone calls from people that work in hotels in belek and bodrum. They are trying to be positive and I am all for that. Hotels in belek I was told are hoping to open in bodrum mid June but I think that’s going to be domestic only IF it happens at all But I am like you I am going to take a punt on late September and see how it goes.Edited: 5:29 am, May 02, 2020 "
Just been reading that sniffer dogs are now being trained to be Able to detect Coronavirus and if successful for them to be used at airports.That’s a interesting idea
"I have no problem with this topic, and good luck to anyone who books.Personally I'm going nowhere until things are back to normal...whenever that may be."
"I think late September going on the reports and projections from Turkey may be a good probability as long as the U.K. numbers are going the right way. The Turkish government will decide on the countries they allow in. Interesting line of research for sniffer dogs. Wonder what Covid 19 smells of?!Andy I have no problem with the topic it’s just it was done to death on other Turkey forums with no basis for the so called facts being given yet were appearing as though it had been made mandatory.Edited: 5:54 am, May 02, 2020 "
"Yes I know sept is still a very slim chance of going but if we are allowed to fly and turkey or Spain allow UK people in I would go for sureRe sniffer dogs I was amazed to learn they can sniff breast cancer. Apparently they are hoping they will be able to smell it in people’s sweat It would be good if it worksEdited: 6:00 am, May 02, 2020 "
"Stalking the forum I have contributed on the forums for many years ! It is second nature to check the Turkey forums and don’t need your comments as your far from perfect. Boyce thank you I know you have noticed that about VIP ! Hope you keeping safe which is what is our main concern !Edited: 10:53 am, May 02, 2020 "

I would refer to this article for the proposed 4-phase timetable:https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-mul…
Will they be expecting people not to eat and drink whilst wearing these masks on the planes?
">>Will they be expecting people not to eat and drink whilst wearing these masks on the planes?Only if travelling in the 'coffin compartment' - in which my Turkish dogs did when travelling back to the UK (alive). It is heated and pressurised and with a guaranteed lie-down place. Take your own coffin, sandwich and bottle of wine and it could be a good way to travel."
I asked the same question Asif. Surely you will keep having to remove your masks to have a drink or to eat anything.
"Well, the recent repatriation flights haven't served food, if that's anything to go by."
