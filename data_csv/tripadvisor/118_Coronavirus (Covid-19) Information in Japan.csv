"Hi! Thanks for setting up this pin! There is a lot of useful information and helpful stories amid the various threads here, and it will be really helpful to have a thread dedicated to Coronavirus in Japan.Today, March 10th, could be a big day. Those of us in Japan, and everyone wondering what the ""next stage"" are waiting to hear what the government will say during today's press announcement. I highly suggest people considering travel to Japan, and those of us already in-county, pay particular attention to today's announcement. And possible follow-ups on Friday, when the government is expected to pass new emergency powers to cope with the crisis.I will be updating Tokyo Coronavirus 2.0 https://medium.com/tokyo-coronavirus/tokyo-c… with information from the government announcements, and other developing stories, as I continue to follow the situation here in my adopted home of Tokyo."
"I have yet to find a single, definitive list of all closures and event cancellations across Japan (if such a list is even possible, given the number sites and attractions!).The Japan National Tourism Association) (JNTO) website https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/In order to contain the spread of infections, some festivals and events may have been canceled or postponed. Also, theme parks such as Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea, and Universal Studios Japan, museums and galleries have been temporarily closed.Temporary closure of attractions in Japan can be found in the [table below](https:/…anchor) https:/…anchor or **JNTO official TripAdvisor account @VisitJapan** .

"@tokyoaaron you are attempting to a good thing and should be given some respect for that but the issue remains that your repeated posts are obsessed, excessively long and rambling, spurious in science and technical factual content in several places, reposting of out of date media links that no longer have relevance and in themselves are factually skewed or incorrect, heavy reliance on random media headline catching articles that tend to sow an atmosphere of general fear and often sensationalist in nature, which are against what many government advisories are requesting not to happen and calm the public.There is also a lot of good information but it should really be trimmed and limited to official information.Edited: 7:26 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Hi Ali0211,thanks for the comments.One thing I've noticed about discussion boards such as these: people come here for different reasons. Some want data-based information; others first-and, subjective accounts.Of course, no-one wats false or misleading information.IBut it's also not fair to criticize without being specific.Can you explain, please, or provide specific examples for:obsessed?spurious in science and technical factual content?out of date media links that no longer have relevance and in themselves are factually skewed or incorrect?random?""sow an atmosphere of general fear and often sensationalist in nature"": first, this forum is a place of opinion a smuch as fact, which you should know if you have been following the debates/arguments which regularly occur in the threads""against what many government advisories are requesting not to happen and calm the public?"" First, specifically show where I am trying to cause panic in the public. Second, it is not anyone's duty to ""tow the government line,"" so to speak, iof they do not feel it represents the truth or is not in the best interest of others. Heck, in America you're allowed to disagree just because you want to! (I'm not saying it's always a good thing, but it is a right)."
"Quick point: I don't think this thread is appropriate dfor this discussion. If you - or others - would like to PM some constructive criticism or useful information re: my Coronovirs posts, I will be happy to receive them.However, this pin was started to share valuable information regarding a crisis which is unfolding around us almost faster than we can track.

"(Note: So far - this breaking news - no word on the new state of emergency bill having provisions which would specifically affect travelers. However, keep in mind that the government already has the power to quarantine travelers to Japan, as it is continuing to do to travelers from parts of China and Korea.Also please note: the bill which is expected to finish passage by Friday (the next two steps are approval by Abe's own LDP party) does NOT necessarily mean these policies will go into immediate effect. Word on the street here in Tokyo is, that people expect the current state of affairs, including b=venue and event closures, to continue for at least another week.The upshot: the government will have far more potential control over the daily lives of people in Japan than previously. No additional bans or quarantines of travelers tied directly to passage of the bill). As expected, the government has started the process of approving/extending (depending on who you ask) the power of prime Minister Abe to declare a state of emergency re: Coronavirus in Japan.If Abe were to declare a state of emergency, local governments would have the power to:- order people to remain indoors- mandatory closure of schools and event facilities (so far, such closures have been voluntary)- take control of food and medicine distribution- temporarily occupy private land without owner's permission (use a hospital as a hotel?)"

"Good one, Bargainhunter. Thank you for posting. When I seek accurate info re COVID-19, I go to reputable health organizations, well known medical/scientific journals, universities and cinnical trial sites, but never a travel forum where anybody can act like an expert and write whatever he pleases. I'm not saying tokyoaaron2's posts are inaccurate because I don't bother reading them, thus I don't know the contents of his posts. One thing I know is that I'm not at all about his credentials and qualifications. I advice everyone to seek info elsewhere but here."

"@Shinzoui MD,PhDYour post count suggests you are are recent visitor to this forum - sure the posts across the Japan TA forum from @Tokyoaaron02 might be long and/or repetitive, but aims to provide information about the information and situation locally.Having a MD and Phd does not make someone an expert on the local situation, nor does it make you qualified to dismiss the opinion of a contributor to this forum. I also live in west Tokyo - the situation is not as dramatic as the media would have people believe. The situation is much worse in other parts of the world.(and for credentials, yes, I am a published medical researcher in epidemiological - a long time ago, but it is there.)"
"@tokyoaaron from what I remember of your rambling post #4 now thankfully removed by moderators, here goes:“Obsessed” judging by the number of your own posts made in this thread so far is self explanatory. Your cheap shots over typos at others above who are highly respected are duly noted as further evidence of being obsessed.“Spurious and science ...” you don’t seem to have the ability to critique the validity of many media links provided. One media article on planes being relatively safe environments for Coronavirus is a second hand rehash of claims by doctors with no references or names of institutions assessing it. The issue in the subject is not virus being airborne as experts say it is not and aircraft ventilation filters being equal to hospitals that will not matter any way as the virus spreads in other ways for a sardine packed plane.“Out of date articles” many/several of your linked articles are dated around 5 March or earlier and things have moved very rapidly on from there simply less relevant.“random” you begin with two quotes from some author and an astronaut both saying it is better to be prepared for the worst so the tone is set to infer panic, when about every government around the globe is asking for calm. The rest of your links and paragraphs are all over the place, basically an unfiltered brain dump of sorts.You are also trying to second guess what the government is going to do with the new laws that havnt passed, it’s fruitless. Comments from a legal, policy or regulatory background person would be preferred.My background is in the area of environmental sanitation and health compliance in government and familiar with dealing with members of the public of your concerns and persuasion. There may be a need for governments to educate the public and consider legal controls against those spreading misleading information in order to manage the situation for the greater public. Don’t worry you are too small a fish to fry and notice on a foreign travel forum.Your best asset is in reporting what the entirely subjective mood or situation in your location appears to be and limiting it to that if you want to be taken seriously. There will be those gullible enough to read your “information” as useful."

Governments and organisations will now trigger their emergency and other plans to the next level, many already have such as Italy, while other countries remain relatively unaffected at this stage.

"tonytt, There's a link at the bottom of each reply, including the first thread starter, that says, ""Report Inappropriate Content."" You can click on that and scroll down to find something that fits your criteria. That's the only way TA ""moderators"" see anything. Yep. It gets old real fast when there's a newbie on the block who posts the same post thread after thread after thread. Today's big ""change"" is that if you live in Europe (in countries that don't have Trump resorts), you will not want to visit the US for a month. You can still come to Japan. Not much will be open, but the parks will be and the Somei Yoshino cherry blossoms will probably start budding the day after tomorrow. Tokyo should be blanketed in pink next week. No parties under the cherry trees. Just stroll and enjoy!"

"Yesterday, I ranted about ALL the people who were up and about in Tokyo on another thread. Japan hasn't seen a spike. Yet. So far, the bell curve is pretty flat, but constant. 30-40 new cases a day. Osaka and Hyogo prefectures are next to each other and have seen a significant rise in patients with 200+ when added together. The mayors/governors have asked people not to travel from one prefecture to the other during this holiday weekend. Hokkaido has seen a big decrease. Tokyo has 114. Yamanashi has 2. Every prefecture has a different sense of ""urgency."" The clusters were monitored. But NOW, they are starting to see patients with no contacts with people in the clusters. So... now is actually the time to be cautious.Here's a map tracker to see who and how many are in your area. …amazonaws.com/…It's a lovely day. Cherry blossoms are OUT!

"I'm sheltering in place in Osaka rather than returning to the US at this time. Japan's immigration site doesn't provide advice for obtaining an emergency visitor visa extension. They only provide advise regarding residency extensions. If anyone hears any advice on extending Japanese visitor visas for US citizens, please post. I would rather not go to the immigration centers and overwhelm their already overwhelmed system. Rather not go out, period. Thank you and stay safe, everyone."
"My son is in Japan. He had planned to attend a conference in Tokyo, but it was cancelled. Now that he is in Japan, he is wearing a mask, taking the necessary precautions, and considering staying. He lives in downtown New York, which was very hard hit. Is it unreasonable for him to stay ? The main issue seems to be that lack of data because limited testing is being done in Japan. Of course the other issue is with being able to return and being quarantined in the US. He has been to Japan many times and is a seasoned traveler. What are your thoughts?"

But as far as I can tell, the page does not link to or mention the US' new worldwide travel advisory.The table covers every country with a history of Coronavirus, from China (81,171) to Turks and Caicos (1).

"Thanks, Global, for the new link. Yet... If I found the ""old"" link and couldn't find the new one, then something is VERY wrong with their website, don't you think? The US should be Banned., not just ""quarantined."" It has over 100,000 cases! There is no way to monitor those who ""self-quarantine."" No one will actually stay in their house for 14 days. People have to eat. Once they go to the supermarket which is ""indoors"" and ""close proximity"" with other people, it defeats the purpose of the ""quarantine."""
The Asahi says Foreign Ministry is now studying for the ban zone (ban by states or whole 50 states). I believe it will be announced in a day or two.
"The US citizens are having their warnings.https:/…international-travel.htmlAnd as ETflyer, it will be updated soon.Once they ban the traffic, the Japanese coming back from the States will have trouble, so they needed time I guess., just like the Japanese Government will make a charter flight to get the Japanese back from Peru."
Lets hope that the US figures out how to flatten the curve quickly. I really am looking forward to traveling to Japan.
#86They already figure out: Shelter-in-place.Maybe not this year.
Thanks Global - maybe later this year or next. :-(
"Japanese Government have just decided to ban the entry of foreigners from China, Korea, and the U.S.A. in addition to those from European countries. The Government also does not allow Japanese to visit to those countries from March 30.Meanwhile, a popular Japanese comedian, Ken Shimura, have just died at 70 years old from the Covid-19 pneumonia yesterday night. I hope the death of popular celebrities like him can change the minds of many Japanese people to be more cautious to the virus, more than whatever our Prime Minister says."
"Maybe Shimura Ken's death will awaken those who were skeptic. Or healthy baseball players. Governor Koike gave a pep talk tonight, but didn't say ""lock down."" Rumors abound. Stocking up on wine and sake, just in case. :-) Wash your hands, gargle, take your shoes off at the entrance way, and close the lid when you flush the toilet!"

"FYI......Health Alert – U.S. Embassy Tokyo (April 1, 2020)   Location: Japan Effective from midnight on April 3, 2020, Japan will bar admission to travelers who have recently visited any country that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has designated ‘Level 3’ for infectious disease concerns, which includes the United States. Travelers from the United States are not permitted to enter Japan and should not board flights. For details and exemptions, please refer to the Japan National Tourism Organization's website. At this time, Japanese authorities advise that passengers transiting in Tokyo’s Narita or Haneda airports without clearing immigration will still be allowed to proceed to their onward destination. Passengers will not be permitted to transit between airports or from an international flight to a domestic flight.  U.S. citizens who are considering returning to the United States are urged to work with their airlines to make travel arrangements while limited commercial flights are still available. Due to a reduction in customer demand, commercial aviation route networks between the United States continue to diminish. Travelers currently in Japan seeking return fights to the United States should immediately consult with their air carrier(s) regarding possible flight rescheduling and/or cancellations.

"""Meaningless"" rules was meant for not letting RESIDENTS back into Japan. Other countries let Residents / Green Card holders back into their countries, even if they're returning from ""banned"" countries. Japan is using archaic rules from 1992. RESIDENTS who own or rent homes, have families, pay taxes, have national health insurance and do everything as the citizens (except vote) should be allowed to ""return.""

I thought the April 3 mattered about that. Everybody observing the law is supposed to quarantine after one enter Japan.

"This is my experience, which I am sharing to show how the Japanese authorities are behaving at this time.I was denied entry into Japan on March 21, after being told by both the Japanese Consulate and the airline that I was going to be able to enter. I am a Swiss citizen, married to Japanese, who visited Japan twice a year.At least another 10 people on the same flight were denied entry, including an unaccompanied minor child, who was therefore separated from his parents who were already in Japan, and a frail elderly couple. I was not sick, and there were no other reasons to deny me entry. I asked for a review of my case, but I was told that it was not posssible. The border authorities lied to me (a review is possible) and violated their own procedures.Japan has the right to decide whom to let in, but at least they should inform the Japanese Consulates and the airline in advance.As a consequence of that, I had to fly back (which took too days, as there was no connection) and a total of about 16 hours on planes, and I was sepated from my wife for more than two months.I tried to get an apology, but I got nothing..My conclusion is that on the surface Japanese authorities are nice. However, when it matters, they do not give a dam about foreigners.Edited: 7:39 am, June 12, 2020 "
"Too bad, Joe, but it's not the usual time. Did you get the valid VISA before your trip?https:/…page4e_001053.htmlI rather would like to know if there were people who were allowed entry on the same flight."
"Maybe if you got here two days or so earlier, you might be able to enter, Joe."
"Thanks for your question. I informed the Japanese Consulate of the arrival date and time of the flight and the Japanese Consulate confirmed to me that I was going to be able to enter with the same procedure as normal. At check in, the airline demanded a marriage certificate, which I produced. They then took about 20 minutes to call, and confirmed that it was OK for me to board.But upon arrival at Narita, I was denied entry, as were many other foreign looking people. It turns out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan made an abrupt change in admission policy, WITHOUT INFORMING the Japanese Consulates or the airlines. This shows disorganization,and complete disrespect for foreigners. They should compensate travellers who suffered because of that. I did not demand any compensation. I asked for an email of apology, but I did not get it. The Japanese authorities behaved in a disorganized and extremely disrespectful way, but do not want to lose face with an apology. In fact the true loss of face comes from their unwillingness to apologize.It takes decades to build trust, but one minute to destroy it. I will never trust Japanese authorities again.And I would like to warn others as well. If things go wrong in Japan, and you are a foreigner, do not expect any respect for your rights Most times things do not go wrong, but sometimes they do. . Take that into account when considering doing business in Japan. As far as I am concerned, I will not do business in Japan ever again.Edited: 11:48 am, June 12, 2020 "
"I wish you well. Of course the Japanese government's policy of denying entry by 'permanent' residents is a violation of human rights. Many countries, including to my knowledge France, Switzerland and the USA have extended the right of entry even to spouses of permanent residents, even if they have no residency papers.But Japan at a time of crisis shows its true nature, i.e. of being insular, not giving a damn about human rights, especially those of foreigners, and being most probably xenophobic as well. In normal times, Japan appears to be nice to foreigners. But the dark side comes out at a time of crisis, like now."
"Did you fly in from Switzerland? Didn't you make the inquiry to the Consulate quite early?I didn't remember exactly when they banned so I googled. They made the decision in March checking the number increase of the COVID-19 patients.https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/9…""Japan has already closed its doors to some regions in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Iran, in addition to the whole of Iceland and San Marino as well as parts of China and South Korea.""It doesn't say exactly when they banned."
"The government was slow in making decisions to deny entry and I'm sorry they haven't contacted the airlines earlier.We just don't want the virus coming in and the tourism time was over in March. Why don't you ask your wife to come to your place?Edited: 2:49 pm, June 12, 2020 "

"#168 JoeFirst, I'm sorry to hear about your traumatic experience on trying to re-enter Japan.

The only G7 nation to do so (and the only country I am aware of which makes such a distinction between citizens and such residents).I don't know oif this will help in your situation, but both the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice, and the Immigration Services Agency have come under a great deal of pressure regarding this draconian policy, and have been trying to backpedal on the policy: ""The reality is we've been allowing foreigners to return on humanitarian grounds regardless of their visa status all this time,"" maintains an official from the Immigration Services Agency, who asked for his name not to be disclosed, in a phone interview with The Japan Times on Thursday.""Clearly, such was not the practice in the case of your flight.I hate to ask, but do you happen to know at what time JAPAN time your flight arrived and you were at immigration? According to this document from the Swiss government the ban went into effect midnight, March 21st, Japan time. https:/…coronaAgain, sorry if that's your case. Though it would certainly put the lie to the ISA claim that ""The reality is we've been allowing foreigners to return on humanitarian grounds regardless of their visa status all this time,""On the plus side, with the increased pressure on the Ministries to do the right thing, it's entirely possible that Japan's normally rather liberal social policies and attitudes can re-surface. In other words, now might be a good time to try again.Japan’s Permanent Residents Stuck in Corona Purgatory: Japan the only G7 country to deny entry to long-term, permanent residents during coronavirus crisishttps://tinyurl.com/y7pgqr3oGood luck Joe! I hope you are re-united with your family soon...Edited: 7:41 pm, June 12, 2020 "
"Joe, so sorry to hear of your nightmare. Here's the latest from June 12. https:/…Were you trying to enter Japan on the visa waiver program? Or do you have Residency? Re-entry Permit? The visa waiver program has been suspended for all the ""banned"" countries, so you will need to contact the Embassy of Japan in Switzerland and apply. You will need a letter of ""invitation"" from your wife in Japan, a letter of guarantor saying she will pay for all of your expenses, including air, accommodation, food, etc.(even if YOU are actually paying for them), and a proper reason for your visit, ie to see family (or to see a spouse who had surgery for cancer, or something ""humanitarian."") She needs to send the papers via courier to the Japanese Embassy in Switzerland as no mail is going to the EU at this time. You will also need to submit all your bank transactions for the past 3 months, plus your passport. The Embassy will send all the paperwork to Japan, the Foreign Ministry will look at them, then will send them back to the Embassy with approval or not. If it's approved, you'll fill out more papers at the airport (beware of confusing English), get PCR test, wait 4 hours for positive or negative, and if negative, you'll need to have someone pick you up at the airport (NO public transportation) and take you to your designated place (your home) where you will be self-quarantined for 2 weeks. If you are well after 2 weeks, then you can go travel around.If you have Residency and a Re-entry Permit (or special re-entry of within a year), they've made exceptions. Then again, it's case by case, and nothing can be guaranteed. Good luck."
"#177 Thanks as always for the important update, mamajelli. The specific examples are extremely useful in demonstrating ""special exceptional circumstances."" Can't help but notice, however, on the MOJ pdf the qualifying line ""The following are specific examples of cases where re-entry may be permitted depending on individual situation.""I simply do not understand the reticence to treat long-term permanent residents with rights, rather than mere privileges, of re-entry. Mamajelli., I know you've said ti before but I'll say it again: if voluntary quarantine is good enough for citizens, it's good enough for long-term and permanent residents.I will update my post with your breaking news...

"I asked the Japanese Consulate and the airline, and did so just hours before flying, whether I could be admitted to Japan. They answered yes. Then I asked the airline again at boarding. I was told that I could fly into Japan. I had a business-related reason to be there.When I arrived at Narita, I was denied admission, but my Japanese wife had to go to Jpan for her business.Therefore we were separated. Then she could not fly back for 2 months.Again the Japanese authorities (ministry) were extremely disorganized (in not notifying their Consulates or airlines) and extremely disrespectul. Moreover, at Narita I was denied the opportunity to appeal the decision, which is a right, according to the immigration flowchart on the Japanese immigration services website immi-moj.go.jp/english/…nyukoku_flow.pdf.I wrote an official letter of complaint, but I did not receive even an apology via email.The Japanese say sorry all the time, but the Japanese administration never apologizes, even when they make mistakes with very seriosu consequences, as it was my case.After all, what should be expected from the Japanese state?Apparently, they never even apologized properly and fully for their second world war crimes. Woudl they bother apologizing for an administrative mistake?This is Japan: Japan does not give a damn about the human right of foreigners. But foreigners such as myself, shoud draw their conclusions. My conclusion is: DO NOT VISIT JAPAN, DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN JAPAN.Edited: 1:44 am, June 13, 2020 "
"By the way, I am not trying to visit Japan any more, or do business there, now, or even after the covid-19 crisis is over. I am too disgusted with the Japanese administration. I coudl change my mind only if I receive a letter of apology.But at the time I tried to enter Japan, the Japanese Conuslate stated that I could enter. But I was denied entry. Every country has the sovereign right to deny entry, but also the obligation to provide consistent information and to follow its administrative procedurs.Japan did not provide consistent information and did not follow its own administrative procedures in my case. This is a great shame, and there is no excuse. And Taro Aso (Japan deputy prime minister), states that covid-19 deaths in Japan are lower because of 'mindo' (Japanese cultural superiority). This is the frame of mind: gajin (foreigners) are deemed inferior, therefore the Japanese administration does not need to respect them.Edited: 1:54 am, June 13, 2020 "
"We do have Murayama danwa and even the former Emperor made apologies.Taro Aso is nothing but a cheap politician. He wanted to say that we didn't need lockdowns.The media criticized it as thoughtless.The visa waiver program was over. sorry for your tragedy but this is a travel forum.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 2:49 am, June 13, 2020 "
"If the visa waiver was over, why didn't the Japanese Consulate or the airline know? As mentioned, I asked them both.Japan has the right to cancel its visa waiver at any time, but it has also the duty to inform its Consulates and the airlines, and failed to do so in a timely manner. This is a serious mistake, that warrants at least an apology, but I received none.Concerning history: compare Germany and Japan. Both committed horrible war crimes, Germany even worse. But Germany really apologized and paid compensation. Not even Jews, who were unfortunately exterminated by Germany then, question Germany now, because Germany has made fully amends.Japan has not. Just ask China, Korea, or many other countries. Japan is a master in saying sorry, without meaning it, and that is not effective. This is why, by the way, Japan has no real allies, other than the USA (the country which unfortunately dropped nuclear bombs unto Japan) and now does not care much for Japan either."
I guess none of us works for the Japanese government. This is not a place for such discussion but for trip.I recommend you to sue the Japanese Consulate. They should have gotten the information and owe you a compensation for your flights.
"First, my story is relevant to this site, as it shows that Japan is not a country that travellers can trust.I do not need to post anything more about my story, unless somebody claims that it is not relevant to this forum, because it is relevant. Second, it is not legally possibly to sue a Consulate, as they have diplomatic immunity. Since you are a travel expert, please take note of my statement. Moreover the fault is with the Ministry in Japan, which did not inform the Consulate, not with the Consulate. I asked for an apology and did not get it. A Japanese lawyer told me that I will not have any chance of success if I sue the Japanese administration.Edited: 8:31 am, June 13, 2020 "

"Hello all. I was supposed to be in Japan again as recently as June 10th but Covid 19 cancelled that. I have made air res. and hotels in late Nov. to midJanuary Hopefully its a go. But if not, shoganai. I see Japan has restrictions and quarantine rules for citizens of 111 countries. USA being one of them. BUT does anyone know what country's citizens are allowed in without compulsory quarantine? It will be very tedious to get a list of the 195 countries of the world and check it against Japan's 'not allowed without quarantine"" rules. I would go to one of the countries, then go to Japan for my stay because IF you are from one of those countries or stay in one for 14 days before arriving in Japn you can enter Japan quarantine free. I have been to Japan 7 times in 4 years and this year woujld have been #'s 8 and 9. I like it there.  Hopefully this question is allowed here. If not, please tell me where it can be posted.

"Dns-Han,#221, Japan IS doing PCR testing on everyone who gets off a plane. If you test negative, you need to self quarantine for 2 weeks at a place you have designated (without taking public transportation) -- as in, someone needs to come pick you up and take you to wherever you said you would stay for 2 weeks (without going out). The ward or city office will actually CALL the phone number you have registered to check if you're really staying there. If you test positive for PCR, they will send you to a hospital or hotel designated for PCR positive patients, and watch you for 2 weeks. Either way, there's a 2 week quarantine before you can go out and travel around the country."
I don't quite understand why would a person with a negative PCR test need to go quarantine? Isn't that overkill for someone who doesn't have covid-19 in his/her body?

Citizenship has nothing to do with the quarantine border control. It is an infectious disease control. The region you stayed or lived in before arrival only matters.

"Two notes:1: The news about opening up travel for Singapore still has heavy restrictions including NO public transport and it is heavily slanted towards business travelers. However, my reading of the article/news report this morning suggested that it might provide a route back into Japan for some residents stranded overseas (and another ""however"" is if that is actually a loop-hole or bad reporting).2: The ""Go To"" campaign @Shot writes about in post #311 does have restrictions and despite being woefully ill-advised as a programme (against expert advice) and so many people not travelling across the bon holidays, some promotional efforts have very tight restrictions. I know some where you have to show you are resident in the local prefecture/city in order to qualify for the vouchers/discounts. I have not tested or investigated if an overseas visitor could get a local resident to arrange/book/obtain discounts under the Go To promotion as it would be a largely academic exercise with no inbound tourism for the foreseeable future."

"The agreement by Motegi and Balakrishnan comes from the request by Japanese government, and it is more beneficial for Japanese business travelers, namely relocations to Singapore."
"That must be true. A lot of Japanese corporations have branches in Singapore, for sure."
"@Global - in the JapanTimes article they talked about business travelers and others - so the talks/agreement/procedures would apply to more than just business travelers. There seem to be quite a few flights that transit Singapore, so if you can get to Singapore, then that seems to be a potential route back to Japan. I haven't bothered to check if you can actually get into Singapore or what their entry restrictions are. Elsewhere it appears there are still lots of restrictions on residents returning, but it is a complicated/messy topic/process. The relevant section from the JT is repeated below:""Expatriates and other long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to stay at home or a designated location for 14 days after arrival.Travelers entering Japan under both categories will be required to report their health condition to authorities via the Line messaging app for 14 days after arrival, install a COVID-19 contact tracing app designated by the health ministry and also agree to retain GPS data for two weeks."""

"Japan Custom Tours,I'm still not sure what you're worried about.https:/…The entry restrictions of Japan seems to make April 3 and July 24 mean so much. Anyway, it is still not the time to make non-essential travels abroad for the people living in Japan. I meet many Chinese and other Asian clerks at conveniece stores and restaurants in my neighborhood, so they must have remained in Japan all the time this year.The loophole used to exist in Okinawa, where many Californians were transferred to the bases without PCR tests but now all of them are supposed to be tested. I cannot imagine doing away with the 14 day quarantine in half a year or so. Hawaii is showing the risk of that."
@Global - I'm not worried. Simply staying put for the foreseeable future.I know other people are worried - I was thinking laterally if the Singapore route might prove an option for some of the many thousands of residents still stuck overseas.

"Latest news is that the JAL Honolulu Marathon will not be cancelled. JAL still hopes to sponsor it in December. Of course, there are many ""challenges"" still to overcome. Right now there are no flights on JAL or ANA to Hawaii. And Hawaii still has a 2 week quarantine before participating in the marathon, plus Japan's 2 week quarantine upon return. So the runner/traveler will need to have lots of TIME to spare. Don't know how a body that's used to running will be able to run after a 2 week ""stay in your hotel and don't leave the room"" BEFORE the marathon. Is that even doable? Anyway, for now, it's for Japanese nationals. Wonder if they will extend it to Residents???? (Not holding my breath.)"
