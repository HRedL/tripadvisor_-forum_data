Hi is it still worth going to Madrid or will it be going into lockdown?
"Madrid is most definitely not in lockdown at this point in time. As to the future, you could just as well ask if Newcastle will go into lockdown any time soon."
"No it is not in lockdown! Life has returned to a new normal. Bars, restaurants and shops are open and precautionary measures are in place. The U.K. government has imposed a blanket whole countrywide quarantine requirement on Spain, even though many parts of the country actually have much lower infection rates than the U.K. There has been a spike in some parts of the country, such as Catalonia, and authorities are taking the necessary steps to contain outbreaks. Nobody can predict if, or when, Madrid, or any other city in the world for that matter will back into lockdown because Covid19 is still an unknown and unpredictable virus."
"Feel so sad for what is happening and feel very frustrated and controlled.I do hope we can still visit Spain next month, our favourite country to visit. What a mess...good luck and let's just pray that all the madness will end soon.GoFingers crossed.Edited: 2:12 am, July 27, 2020 "
"Pat: The airbridge situation is reviewed every 3 weeks, I believe, by the U.K. govt so I guess it will just have to be a waiting game. Sad thing is that many people feel more reassured and safer in Spain than they do in the U.K., me included."
"it was in the news yesterday explaining the decision Uk cases are currently 16/100,000 and spain has risen to 39/100,000the air bridge cut of point is 16/100,000 government explained cases have risen all over spain and not just in the northern areashttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaEdited: 4:25 am, July 27, 2020 "
"I would love to see the figures that the UK government are working on. The figures for every region and autonomous community are published in the Spanish news and press every day (except weekends). Some areas are entirely COVID free. Others like my island of Menorca have precisely 10 active cases! I can only presume that we should believe our own government here in Spain is providing its population with incorrect data and that the UK government has much more reliable figures. I listened this morning on UK radio to a government spokesperson, asserting that cases were also rising fast across ‘the islands’, albeit from a low base. But they were unable to provide any figures. That says it all."
It's a disgrace. I feel we are not being honest with. All political imo.Sorry but that is how I feel.I have been looking for a gateway back to the UK without having to do the 14 day. I thought maybe France but it says if you come from a high risk place then you have to do the 14 on arrival.It is a joke.
Patsurely you must realise that this has been done for a reason? to prevent further restrictions in the UK and inconvenience to everyone? Holidays will be missed i'm sure but let's look at the bigger picture here. If we don't sort this out we will be wearing face masks for the next 2 years. The truth is travel bridges were created to allow us to visit places where we were exposed to the same or lesser risk. Data now shows this is no longer the case for Spain so the government is trying to protect you and the rest of us!
"Please explain to me why the FCO says it is safe to travel to all the Spanish islands, but you must quarantine on return to the UK? It is illogical. We are more at risk of imported cases here, so maybe we will be safer if people from the UK cancel their holidays. But, for small family businesses across all the islands it is a total disaster. People will literally close and never reopen. Young people will once again move to the mainland as there is no prospect of work here and poverty will be widespread like in ‘the crisis’ years"
The reason given for this is because there is still a high level of free movement between spanish tourists from mainland spain to the islands which isn't restricted and cant be UK controlled
Follow that logic and it is therefore unsafe to travel to the islands too!
Oh dear. The trouble is most people can't see the bigger picture and what is really happening.
"Being British but living in Madrid, and having first hand experience of both countries during these times I can 100% say that I feel safer and more reassured in Madrid. Safety and hygiene measures are not being as rigorously enforced in the U.K. and people seem confused or reluctant to embrace what they should be doing, which is little wonder given the continual backtracking and contradictions by the U.K govt. No govt is perfect, but I have much more confidence in the Spanish govt during this crisis and I am not generally their biggest fan."
"The 2 governments have difficult decisions to make. Spain does have a population that knows the law enforcement agencies do have the powers in strength to make people follow the rules. UK may try to persuade people rather than dictate orders because it seems that British people generally like to do ""The right thing"". In Spain we saw disinfectant personnel spraying all over the streets early on. I don't think we saw that so much in UK. I have thought for some weeks that as soon as the hot weather comes and people head to beaches and relax, a lot of the good work of ""lockdown"" may be hit. Also there is a real need for everybody who has been at home for so long to enjoy something that they always have done. However at this time it is necessary to be aware of the guidance of the health professionals and this latest article is worth reading.https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-07-2…"
"I agree totally with LivvyMad above,I spent the whole lockdown in a city not all that far from Madrid where I have a flat and although scared at times,I felt that everything was being done to keep everyone safe as possible.I recently returned to the UK and feel less secure than in Spain.I don't think anyone should put off their visit and I plan to return to my home in Spain again at the end of August."
"At#15, safer in madrid than the uk in respect to infection from covid 19?Do the statistics actually back that up or is it a subjective feeling?Atb steve"
"Steve: The number of infections across Spain have been on the increase since the original discussion on this thread took place. Some consider it to be a second wave, others do not. It is of little surprise that the infection rate has increased, as tourists have been allowed in and many locals have travelled to other parts of the country on holiday. The same is true in several other countries. The infection rate is also increasing in the U.K. The situation is fast changing world over! As for feeling safer and more reassured here in Madrid, I actually stand by that comment having recently spent time in my native U.K. This is based on first hand experience of spending time in both countries. Checks on entry to Madrid airport are more rigorous and hygienic (*hygiene in relation to how health declaration/locator forms are processed) than those at Heathrow. People in the U.K. are told to wear face masks in stores, but this is not enforced and most shop staff don’t even bother wearing them - complete opposite of what is happening here. We now have to wear face masks at all times, irrespective of social distance. Additionally, despite it being a requirement to wear face masks on public transport, many people in the U.K. still do not seem to be complying, and yet are still being allowed to board buses and trains unchallenged. It is by no means perfect here, and there will always be people who flout the rules, but rates of compliance and enforcement appear to be much higher here, and that is what is reassuring."
"Hello livvy, infections are indeed rising in the uk, spain across europe and beyond though some individual countries too have more success than others in limiting it.Spain has had some alarming growth in infection rates in areas in 100/200 even 300's per 100,000 people not just since this thread started but since the new normal.Spains condition from the end of phases into the new normal was nowhere near as good as presented, deaths going from the 100's to zero was an indication that the counting had stopped, and this continues still with dubious official statistics still being put out.I agree that the compliance to mask and safety protocols is very high in spain, higher than many places but all the hand sanitiser and masks cannot disguise that spain in general and its cities in particular have big problems, perhaps the worst in europe at the current time.Madrid recently setting up a ""field hospital"" in expectation of a creaking health system, whilst proclaiming spains safe ""come on in"" tells its own tale.For me feeling safer in one place or another is a state of mind rather than what the stats say.Atb steve"
"Hello Steve, I would say that Madrileños generally embraced the phased easing of lockdown and returned to shopping, dining out etc to support their economy more so than people in the U.K. have. Many places, London included, are still like ghost towns with people reticent (or scared?) to embrace any new kind of normal. Indeed, I read that two thirds of people in the U.K. are yet to return to work. I am no expert, but it stands to reason that as more people return to a near normal way of life, the more they travel around, and the more tourists return, then the more rates of infection are bound to rise - that is exactly what is happening in Spain just now. We cannot stay locked down indefinitely, and we need to learn to live with the virus, so peaks and troughs in infection rates are to be expected everywhere. The field hospital in Madrid was originally set up back in March and was mothballed when infection rates fell. It was always the understanding that it could be reutilised should it required again in future. That is prudent, given that Autumn will be approaching with flu season, and also due to the fact that thousands of people will return to Madrid from other parts of Spain at the end of August early September. I personally anticipate another increase then as people return to the city from all over Spain, but that is based purely on my own hunch! I am sure the UK will also reinstate Nightingale hospitals if rates continue to climb. I suspect we will see a lot more local lockdowns to keep on top of clusters of infections.With regards to the statistics, I take much of that with a pinch of salt. I suspect many countries, Spain and U.K. included, are guilty of dubious statistics, as many of these politicians are self serving and covering their own backsides! We will, one day, when the post mortem of this pandemic takes place, find out the true figures. Unfortunately, for now, I suspect we are being drip fed what they feel they can get away with! I agree that feeling safer in one place more than another is more of a state of mind thing, and additionally, it is based on personal experience and first hand observations and comparisons. As I said, from my own perspective, I still feel safer in Madrid than I do in my home city in the UK, irrespective of statistics. Stay safe and well Steve."
"Hello livvy, indeed the uk has been slower getting back to pubs and restaurants ect partly due to the protracted nature of the uk's less strict lockdown taking longer to pull stats down to a level at which time such places could reopen and the need at many hospitality places to pre book tables limiting to an extent drop in trade. Spain generally has by climate more outdoor hospitality which is less inviting much of the time in the uk.Think scepticism about risks is there too and probably existed in spain when they opened cafes bars ect, but that was way before the uk, who went into lockdown only a week after spain.My guess is the uk still has homeworkers and furloughed staff but not i imagine in the numbers you outline, the uk did have a more generous furlough and other schemes in place than spain which is no bad thing.So i agree to spain has to some degree been out and about longer whether this is the cause of generally higher rates i am not sure.For me spains biggest problems are borne from things we admire, in better times about spanish culture, such as their socialbility, family being central to life, inter generational contact within family groups from youngest to oldest, extended families living together, all things that maybe don't lend themselves to controlling a very transmissable virus.You too keep safe and well livvyAtb steve"
