Just a few questions about Sandals opening in Barbados on June 4th - 1 - Do they have government approval?2 - From what countries on what airlines will be bringing tourists?3 - Will the tourists have to stay in quarantine for 14 days before they can vacation at the Sandals resort?There' are of course more questions but my final one is:4 - Really?
"I think only one question actually applies Verona ----------------Really !!! However, when you think about it, staying at Sandals is pretty much like being in Quarantine any way, so as long as guests do not leave the property , I suppose it could work, although I do fear for the Staff .---------------?"
"You know, when it all boils down, we all know that Bajans need to work and will work, some of them in the most dangerous circumstances , but to bring visitors in at this stage, when one considers that Sandals main guests are from America and the UK which are the two worst affected countries in the World , how could the Government allow it ?  We still have a curfew from 8pm to 5am , we still have restricted shopping to 2 half days a week , we still can only use the beach from 6am to 9am ( Sandals ??? ) ,we have a Covid 19 Czar who last night said if Bajans didn't start taking Social distancing seriously and start abiding by the rules , he would reverse all the easements he had just made immediately. How the hell can Sandals be allowed to have guests in the next couple of weeks ?Edited: 6:58 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Ps, Tonight's News reveals we have yet another positive case today ------------someone who has no history of being in contact with any known case. That brings the total to 85."
"So people would have booked with Sandals many months ago. If Sandals open they will not have to refund bookings? People cant get here, not Sandals problem?"
"Vernoa. Hotels are allowed to be open.. (not the spa's etc.. associated with them.. ).. it's in the lasted curfew information. The borders of this island haven't ever closed. So.. there is really no need to ""ask permission of the government"".but the question remains. Unless Sandals is flying people in on private Jets.. who will they be using for Flights.. cause. .there aren't any. Airlines have said they are starting but I don't think they even know.and no.. I'm not really going to speak to what Sandals can, can't and will do for refunds.. No. .it's not their fault. .but i'd be highly pissed and make the world know, if Sandals DIDN'T give me a refund. full stop.. speaks volumes if they don't.. just saying.."
"Sunnie If Sandals does get guests, they would not be allowed on the beach apart from 6am to 9 am would they ?"
And what about the Restaurants ? Are hotels now allowed to let their guests eat in Restaurants all together or is it still Room Service only ?
"that's actually correct Westie.right now the rules would have to be followed just like every one else. beaches only open from 6 am to 9am. and restaurants at all except for delivery and I think hotels can do room service and that's it. These things are in effect for , I think, another week or so.. Things may change prior to 1 june, however.. remember ALL the beach in Barbados our PUBLIC.. so Sandals also can't section off their beach to suit their guests.. funny enough, I can't find the end date for Phase 2.. nor can I find what she said about hotels and their environs.. will keep searching, ,but it was basically hotels can be open, but.. with restrictions.. like spa's, salon's, gyms etc couldn't be open.. nor restaurants except for room service.."
"Post 3, so very appropriate Westie, as a certain Ignoramus has put America first, certainly in terms of numbers of infections and sadly,deaths.He now indicates his intentions to open up his country again for business in direct contradiction of medical advice who urge caution.Never mind,the electorate will have their say in November."
"How would hotels sanitize beach beds - furniture - bar stools - etc etc between use of one guest and another ? also how would they keep couples 6 ft /2 m/ social /physical distancing apart from other couples -not just in dining rooms - but on the beach eventually, and bars and restaurants and elsewhere in resort? - or don't they care? - in which case poor Bajan servers and population.... don;t think this is a good idea while C19 has no vaccine (and if/when the vaccine becomes available it is not made mandatory for travelers )"
"ASO, I think it will be a few months before any sun beds will be put on beaches , sanitised or not. As I said,rather than extend the easements, the Czar is threatening to withdraw them , especially regarding beaches and buses.  Yesterday, he said he had spend the day travelling around Barbados and seeing people blatantly breaking Curfew and Lockdown laws in all quarters. He said Bajans were Hard Eared and if they couldn't behave , he would withdraw his concessions immediately. The latest case is a 31 year old Bajan with no known contact to a traveller or known case, this is the second case of that type ( some are saying third ) Covid 19 is now being Community spread. However, Sandals is the perfect quarantine Hotel especially if they allow public pools to be open, which at the moment , they are not. Remember, when beaches eventually open, they all open and all beaches are public. As Sunnie points out, Sandals cannot keep locals from mixing with their guests."
"Westie ""However, Sandals is the perfect quarantine Hotel especially if they allow public pools to be open, which at the moment , they are not.""""But the real question in all of this is: Are you at a crowded beach or a crowded pool? If (you are) and there's people splashing around everywhere, there's more likely to be virus in the water. But you're also more likely just to get breathed on in that scenario."" . ""We may find outbreaks associated with pools and then again, we might not.""It's an evolving situation ... (because) this is a new virus. A lot of what we say is assumption based on the way other viruses behave. And we can't be all that certain."""
"ASO, if Sandals guests want to travel at this time to a massive AI Hotel, and then they surely know the possible consequences of being in a large group so it's up to them isn't it ?  As I said, it's the workers I feel sorry for. Room Service for that many people will be a challenge in itself, but at least they would be earning money."
"Chrisky, I wonder why the Ministry closed all Hotel and Public swimming Pools then ? They even tried to close ours, yet ours is listed as a private Pool That ban, as far as I know, has not yet been lifted."
"They may have closed pools because that was the thing to do 8 weeks ago. Since then some research has been done and as the article says the chance of catching covid from a pool, lake or the sea is low. If the pool is crowded the chance rises because you get the virus from another person not the water. As they learn more about this virus things and precautions change."
"Yes Chrisky - apparently virus Can live in water - and one should not ingest pool water ! - and most danger is from breaths from others using pool at the same time (I had sent article to Westie as I knew she was using our Private Pool as a reassurance that it was OK)https://ca.news.yahoo.com/beach-bummer-novel… found the linkEdited: 10:02 am, May 13, 2020 "
"Chrisky,the Town Hall Meeting is about the construction of Royalton . Nothing to do with opening pools or Sandals.  You posted the Sandals article, we commented -------------it's a forum, so thank you for the information."
"The important parts of the article IMO...""Living in water and being infectious in water are different things, though. And experts seem torn on what that means for COVID-19.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its website ""there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas.""and""Furness said an outdoor pool — provided it's not crowded — would be the safest swimming environment because chlorine used to treat water can kill the coronavirus ""after about 15 minutes."" Heat from the sun also acts to limit the virus's power, and it won't remain viable for long on concrete pool decks like it can on other softer surfaces."""
"Chrisky.. you posted the article. NON of us work for Sandals, so while we can't definitively give answers to questions, we can comment on what the current protocols are on the island. Sandals CANNOT circumvent the government and the government ISN'T going to allow them to do things others cannot. and that goes for any other hotel on the island. The beach is public, so only open from 6am to 9amRestaurants are not open except for deliveryNot all shops are open, nor salons or spas, no watersports etc.and a mandatory curfew from 8pm to 5am for everyone and in all honesty, the 5am to 6pm daylight hours, the public technically shouldn't be out except to shop on their Alphabet Day or be dealing with an essential service. These directives do not exclude anyone .. they govern anyone who is currently on the island..AND.. there currently is a mandatory 14day quarantine when they arrive.. still can't figure out how that's going to work.. and of course the biggie. .no planes to bring them in on.. Just saying."

"The Sandals page and then this topic is just like it was in the UK on 'Muddled Monday' after Boris's speech on Sunday ..... more questions that answers and then confusion""""""then they surely know the possible consequences of being in a large group so it's up to them isn't it ?""""""Not so sure this is true .... I guess many people - desperate to get away - will believe the Sandals blurb and assume it is 'safe' ...... not everyone questions what they are told by big organisations or a GovernmentSandals may be working on an assumption that things will ease ....maybe believing too many of the Trumpisms ...could get caught out - especially if the airlines do not fly through lack of customers willing to take the risk...or have they been 'talking' to Governments and know something we do notIn the end it will the Governments and the airlines that decide access to a country ...not SandalsInteresting times - Let's be careful out there"
"The Government bottom line is getting the tourist back,they will only practice social distancing on our people but not on their bread and butter the ""tourist"" no matter what ,like you said people flying in from hot spots should never enter our island until all is cleared."
"Not true, I hope, Stay. We already have numerous tourists still here, and they have to follow the rules as everyone else does. If you see them not social distancing, then tell the Police and help keep everyone safe."
