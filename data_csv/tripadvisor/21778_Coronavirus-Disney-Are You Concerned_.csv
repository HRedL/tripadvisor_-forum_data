We are headed to Disney on in 2 weeks. My son and DIL are worried about the children being in Disney with the Cornavirus spreading. I see no need for panic since there are so few cases here but do understand their concern. Is anyone changing plans for Disney due to Cornonavirus?
"I’m going in Aug from UK. It does concern me, but nothing can really be done from our side. It has to be a personal choice but if not many cases about then I’d still go, I would still go today."
"If I had a trip paid for already, I’d go. I just went to Vegas and really didn’t worry. But, I don’t know if I’d run out to book a trip to go now unless they were offering some great deals. Carry on with existing plans and just wash your hands. Bring some wipes and hand sanitizer. Just as likely to catch it at grocery store, school..."
We go tomorrow. I'm more worried about RSV and flu - THAT's widespread in US. Lots of hand washing and not touching handrails or faces.
"Nope. We had a case in Boston. Nothing happened here because of it. Just spent a week and a half travelling Alaska, Washington, and Canada. Nothing happened, and Washington and Canada have cases.Going to Disney next week with no concerns at all. There aren't cases anywhere in the southeast yet.I wouldn't be getting on a cruise ship at this point, but travel outside of that and China does not concern me yet. I do have a flight via South Korea in a couple months, that is the only travel plan I am currently watching."
"A little bit, we’re leaving for Orlando today. I went to Target yesterday and loaded up on wipes and hand sanitizer."
"I would not change plans at this stage.Edited: 11:01 am, February 27, 2020 "
Nope..
No flu viruses are present every year
JSMLA is correct. Think about your daily habits. Wash your hands often. Try not to touch your face. Don’t touch handrails.All this is hard for kids
Not going to change my plans.
"We're leaving for WDW tomorrow. I'm a little worried, but plan on using hand wipes/Purell quite a bit. We'll also be monitoring the news carefully, and change plans mid trip if necessary. Any news on those cast members who were asked to stay home after their trip to Italy?"
"Im worried myself... not about the virus itself since flu kill more people each year... imSuppose to go from 28 march to 17 april at the end of springbeeak and beginning of easter... since i paid everything... disney tickets, universal ticket...If they close parks because of more cases my vacation will ve totally f**cked up..."
The northern part yes Mike LOL
Since im from france if border are closed and flight canceled maybe insurance will work...But if my flight is ON but only all park are close... im not sure disney will refund...
"Im going in 8 weeks, my only fear is Disney closing or flights being cancelled. I admittedly suffer from severe anxiety so i know these are very unlikely events....but the fact even i'm not too worried about catching it speaks volumes!"
I was at MCO yeaterday for a flight back home. The airport was busy as usual. Out of all these people wandering about I seen only 2 wearing face masks .Now at Gatwick airport waiting on the Glasgow flight and haven't seen as yet anyone wearing masks
Just seen several people wearing them in the last hour.No idea when we'll get home Mike. Our Gatwick ...Glasgow plane is gubbed !!!
"I'm not concerned about dying from COVID-19 as I am not in a high-risk category. I am concerned about catching and spreading it, though. I am also concerned about park closures and/or international travel bans that may interrupt a vacation in mid-trip. If you haven't already booked your trip, I recommend deferring until this blows over.If you go, follow normal hand washing protocols, etc. However, avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing will be a challenge. WDW is a crowded place where you get squeezed into queues and crowded venues (e.g,, parades, fireworks). There is little respect for your personal space or maintaining a social barrier.My advice is to stay away if you haven't already committed to the vacation and to try to stay as safe as possible if you do go."
"We have a trip planned 8/3-8/12. No plans to cancel. Short of the CDC issuing domestic travel bans, we are going. There is a low number of cases in the US and none in Florida. Your chances of having a lot of other horrible things happen to you while traveling are higher than catching this virus."
"We go in May and the only thing I have done is contacted my insurance providers to find out if we are covered should there be a wider outbreak in the US and WHO or FCO advise against/ban travel there.Other then this and carrying extra disinfectant wipes in my park bag, I have no plans to change or cancel our holiday and am still excitedly counting down."
Just seen on Virgin’s website that if you are due to fly to US from UK and have been to China or other Asian countries in the last 14 days you will not be allowed to board.You can reschedule or get a refund but of course this only covers flight. On the other hand I doubt there are many who will be affected having visited Asia just before a trip to Florida.
We are going to Florida in 3 weeks and I am concerned that even if we get there the parks may close and then our trip will be ruined or we could get quarantined and not be able to get home! We will still go and take our chances though. Not sure where we stand on our park tickets though?
"Disney is not going to close the parks. There isn't even coronavirus in Florida. Seriously, people are overreacting."
"Hi MarionGubbed... what a cracking word, I've not heard that for a while I must try to get it into a conversation today.."
"anonymous9257 - Whilst I agree with what you are saying there are some of us who don't have a trip for many weeks and whilst there isn't a case of Coronavirus in Florida ""at the moment"" that doesn't mean there wont be. An awful lot can happen in just 1 week so for those of us who don't travel for another 3 or 4 (or in my case 11) weeks, it could be a problem should it become more widespread in the US and specifically, Florida.Just to point out the UK has only had 17 confirmed cases and today there is news/reports of potentially cancelling sporting events and festivals to contain further spreading of the virus. Should there be a significant number of people infected within Florida (Orlando specifically) who's to say the theme parks wont close for a day or 2 to try and prevent further infection?I agree that it is pointless worrying/panicking about it as you cant change it if it happens. Merely take precautions, make sure your insurance will cover you and keep everything crossed that you trip wont be affected but neither you nor I can say at this stage with complete confidence that park closures will or will not happen.Edited: 10:33 am, February 28, 2020 "
I spoke with my travel agent this morning. We get trip insurance directly through Disney. She said Disney's official word AS OF NOW is that they will not cover trips that people cancel due to fear of the disease. I have no idea how other insurance companies are handling this.
"My granddaughter is scheduled for a trip to WDW mid-March, but I really think her trip should be postponed. Her trip is via the Make-A-Wish Foundation as she has an incurable immune disorder since 2 months old, now age 6, and she lives on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The trip involves major air travel and huge crowds at WDW. I really think Make-A-Wish should step in and postpone until more information and testing is available in the U.S. Does anyone agree or what are your thoughts?"
"I gotta be honest, I am now concerned. It’s on 6 continents and now have California patient who had no known exposure.If Disney closes it won’t be for a day or two. How long has Hong Kong been closed now? Disney Tokyo is closed now too till mid March.I am not saying Orlando will close, how would anyone predict? But this is a nasty virus and we don’t know much about it. Don’t panic but don’t blow off concerns either."
"The Asian parks didn't close until there were many cases of on the ground transmission of the virus. Other than that random California case, the US does not have that yet. Our quarantines are working. Until the US becomes a place of community spread, Disney is not going to close the Orlando parks.Being afraid to travel to a place that is not currently in outbreak is mind boggling. You are in more danger every time you get in the car than you are going to Disney at this point."
not concerned. Flu is more common and have there even been any cases in Florida?
There have been no cases in Florida at all. There was a case in Boston at one point and I was there yesterday on a field trip. We weren't restricted from going or anything.
"If you want to be concerned about catching something, it should be the flu."
"Influenza is more common in the US, sureBut there is a vaccine for the flu, about 45% effective this year. And we have tamifluNo covid19 vaccine or antiviral yet.Also the flu kills about 0.5 % of infected. Coronavirus May be as high as 2.5%I hear what you are all saying, but no one knows what will happen in April or May in Florida."
I’m expecting that eventually WDW will close. Only question is when and how long.I think a lot of people are in denial about what’s happening.
I think alot of people believe anything the media say.
"What exactly is happening? Did Disney close during swine flu? That infected an estimated 1/5 of the world's population and killed over 500,000 people? I don't think so. And swine started in Mexico. Everyone needs to relax and see what happens, but the hysteria, especially for the United States (at this point) is WAY over board."
"Mike c, beats me. I’m referring to just acknowledging what’s happening in other countries and that inevitably same is going to happen eventually in the US; people will get sick, some will die, measures will be taken to slow it down including closing things like theme parks."
Unless there are hundreds of cases I cannot see the parks closing. So far the US seems to have avoided many cases and if they implement measures now ( as they are) they will avoid masses of people being infected. As of now if you want to fly from the UK to the USA if you have recently visited China or the other Asian countries affected they will not even let you board the plane. There is no need to panic about something that may never happen.
"None of the Asian parks are under Disney’s control either. The Chinese government is the majority owner in Shanghai and Hong Kong...want to bet who actually made the call to close those two?Disney has no ownership stake in Tokyo Disney at all (perhaps why those are the most well done parks of them all - no expense is spared there, unlike the penny pinching at WDW and Disneyland).Unless there is intense pressure from the US or French governments, I highly doubt that Disney closes the parks they actually control.Edited: 5:26 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"We have a trip planned for end of March that we are most likely canceling. One vacation isn’t worth the risk since they’re saying it’s not a matter of if, it’s when. We also have a toddler though, and I can’t trust him to wear a mask or wash his hands as well as he needs to before touching his face."
"Marilynandmick, has nothing to do with panic. I’m saying exactly what the CDC is saying.‘ The theme parks are closely monitoring the updates after top U.S. health officials warned the burgeoning coronavirus is certain to spread more widely in the United States at some point.“It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen — and how many people in this country will have severe illness,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a call with reporters.’And Mike C, this has nothing to do with zika. That’s like comparing apples to Buicks.And re the parks closing, WDW, Seaworld and Universal all have the same policy of following the lead of the Florida Dept of Health and the CDC. And those organizations policy would be to close the parks if a contagion vector is identified. The most likely option for them to not close the parks is if if becomes so widespread so quickly that closing would do nothing to stop the pandemic. This all comes back to my comment about denial. But it’s true there’s no point in panicking. This is gonna happen whether we panic or not.Edited: 12:04 am, February 29, 2020 "
Honestly I do not understand the panic.We have virus like illness every few years TBH there are so many people walking around with this that don't even know they have it!Unless you have a poor immune system no way would I cancel a trip anywhere if it was still open.You can catch this at home just as easily as in a theme park.
"So you go ahead and cancel when at the moment there is no need to. Okay. Then you find out the guy three doors down has just come back from a business trip to China. What are you gonna do, move? We are not going to Disney until Sept by which time I hope it’s all done and dusted but we are going to San Fransisco in May and unless I am officially told otherwise we are going. I even had someone tell me not to go to Chinatown in SF “in case you catch something”. Still if everyone cancels it will make the rides easier to access."
For the one who said he ll never cancel ....When u spend a bench of dollar for vacation to orlando where the only thing to do there are PARKS!Like i already said i dont care about the virus... but if they close park my vacation will be dead... and dont say we are in panic mode since in france it goes from 10 cases to 150 in 3days! Same happen in italy with some city in quarantine...My flight is 28march... so alot can happen....
"Chances are that if the parks are closed it’s because the area is on lockdown, in which case you won’t be able to go at all and your insurance should cover you."
"Influenza (flu) kills TENS OF THOUSANDS of people every year. We should be more concerned about flu. Wash your hands. More importantly, be mindful to NOT touch your face with your hands. And by the way, regular surgical-type masks are ineffective. They may even help someone catch covid-19 because it can cause someone to touch his/her face a lot because they're not accustomed to wearing it."
Angela - you are cancelling your holiday - have you been advised to cancel? Where do you stand regarding the money side of things at this late date?
"Mike C we go 28th March. These are exactly my feelings, two completely different 'expert' approaches, who do you trust? We are travelling with 3 x 18 month olds. Holiday of a lifetime to have the whole family together. It's our favourite place in the world. I'm keeping everything crossed xEdited: 11:38 am, February 29, 2020 "
According to CNN - 60 yes 60 people in the USA have been diagnosed with the virus I certainly wouldn’t be cancelling my holiday unless advised to do so It’s the elderly with respiratory issues who are most susceptible
"Ur more likely to die falling out your own bed than from coronavirus, i might sleep on the floor in my hotel wearing a bio hazard suit and gas mask"
I really don't get why anyone would cancel a trip to the USA over this virus. Less than 100 people have it that are known of. I'm sure others do have it that have no or very little symptoms.Here in Australia something like 20 people have it and we already have idiots not letting Asian Doctors touch their children because they think they are going to get the virus.This is media fear mongering at it's finest.
"I have a trip booked and paid for in late July...I don’t plan to cancel now, but if things get worse as the date draws near I might. For now I am not booking non refundable extras like After Hours. One thing to consider is that Disney might be ordered by the CDC to close right before your trip. All the non American parks have been forced to close right now"
"I can only speak for myself, but the issue isn’t traveling to the US or in my case another state, it’s that airports are full of people who have been god knows where that could spread the virus and the planes don’t get cleaned between flights if ever. The arms and trays are so gross! Then you have Disney itself which draws an international crowd and you are elbow to elbow with people while employees bellow at you there is no line shove in closer to keep things moving. Where was they guy sitting next to me wiping his nose on his hand last week? Was he in Italy? China? A state that has the virus? Thousands of hands touch everything in the Disney parks. I have gone 11 times and only once come home with a cold, but we don’t know a lot about this virus, it could be easier to catch. Then you have quarantine worries. I don’t want to be “jailed” in Florida if there is an outbreak, I am sure others feel the same."
"No need to cancel, the situation now is not that bad in the US. At least from what I read far from the current situation in northern parts of Italy and Iran.We’re flying to Malaysia half-term May. Booked on a Bahamas cruise & then WDW for Oct half-term. Already paid for flights & accommodation for Xmas & New Year in Phuket. All hotspots area - Malaysia, Cruise and Thailand. As all mostly been paid for and insurance won’t reimburse if there isn’t a government directive to advice people against travel to those areas, I don’t intend to cancel if the situation then is comparable to now. If it gets worse, then will reconsider based on latest info and advice. Obviously will take extra precautions especially with the kids. Just hoping for the best!"
I remain concerned. Today’s reports add to that.
"aerin-sol half of the things you mentioned can happen to you on a trip to your local grocery store or public transport.Like another poster said earlier, if your neighbor got it would you sell your house and move? I find it so absurd the level of panic that is going on."
I am supose to go in september. For now i will wait and see. I am not so scared of the virus but what i am scared is the lockdowns.... i would not want to be stuck in florida for an X period of time not be able to go home...
"Mike c, I understood what you meant. You were talking about the hype, media reaction, etc. It’s a typical knee jerk reaction to make that comparison. We get that in emergency services all the time.And it’s still baseless. If you are paying attention and are informed you should understand why. But on the surface I can understand how it’s relevant to you.The solution is just to read more and be more informed. Doesn’t change anything about what I said earlier execept again it underscores the denial part."
"More concerned about trip being cancelled- all booked as package with Disney... so covered by ATOL, but would be gutted if we could not go.I'm of the opinion that possibility fo me getting is normally (I work in retail were it feels like every second customer has a cold/flu) is the same as at disney... so may as well go to Disney."
"I am a retired GP and wouldn’t want to travel with children or be around other people’s children. All the precautions aside by adults, kids will be what they are and you just don’t know what nor where they have been. And personal hygiene isn’t what it used to be. Definitely cancel if possible. This outbreak is different to seasonal flu. Trust my expert opinion not armchair medics.."

"Michael Sorry but how does being a retired GP make you an expert on this virus?Edited: 5:17 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Let’s all just calm down and take a chill. Coronavirus will get to Florida and the vast majority of people will be fine. The demographics show that the highest rate of infection is amongst men over the age of 65 with underlying health worries. The also indicate that the younger you are the more resilient towards the infection you are. This is the norm with most infections. We live in a digital age with forums etc that give the naysayers and gloom mongers a platform to feel important by spreading truths and half truth. Keep calm and carry on.Edited: 5:57 am, March 01, 2020 "
"All events with more than 5k people are now FORBIDDEN in france... all concert canceled, marathon etc...."
"Personally I cannot understand the logic of some of the things other countries are doing to contain the virus. Take France. They have now banned all events with 5000 people or more. So does that mean that if you are at an event with 4999 people there you will be okay? Surely it should be all or nothing. As for cancelling your trip unless you are forced to by your government its a crazy thing to do. Cancelling will not protect you, you can stand next a carrier in the supermarket and pick it up so what do you gain by cancelling. You will probably lose a lot of money and have unhappy kids. Go, enjoy yourself and just take normal precautions."
"All events over 5000 in France are not cancelled. It’s only those taking place in indoor arenas. People being selective in their use of facts cause panicEdited: 6:40 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Mike, re the numbers, I don’t know. Are the existing Disney park closures reasonable? I don’t know. I defer to the experts at the responsible authorities. I do think some of it is cya on the part of the operators.Similar for who to listen to; in the States it would be the CDC. And I quoted them previously.We travel to Orlando in two weeks. We will be in Washington state prior to that, near what has just been identified as an outbreak. We will proceed with the trip but will be bringing hand sanitizer and being vigilant with our kids regarding hand washing and other basic precautions. And I’m not investing anything further into the vacation that is not refundable. Imho that is a reasonable response.Edited: 7:40 am, March 01, 2020 "
So the marathon of paris as far as i know isnt indoor.... and it got canceled
This thread is running better than a tipping thread. Also is spreading quicker than the virus LOL
"I imagine the vast majority of people on this thread, who feel qualified to advise others and make definitive statements about this virus are completely unqualified to do so. Do you have medical training? Are you virologists? Do you have access to all the research and data on this virus? Even if you claim to be qualified, how does anyone know that on an anonymous internet board?Even the experts are not certain of the path of this virus or even the death rate yet. There is not enough data. The OP asked if they should be “concerned.” The answer is yes. The Theme parks are a perfect breeding ground for a virus that seems to be highly contagious and has a long, symptom free incubation period. There is no cure and no vaccine. Due to the lack of access to healthcare many Americans face, it is likely that many cases exist right now that have not been diagnosed. The Bleak reality in this Country is that tens of millions of Americans can not afford to visit a doctor or take time off work for flu like symptoms.Will this virus quickly run its course, or could this grow into a pandemic like the Spanish Flu that killed more than 30 million people worldwide? No one knows. Only each person can decide what actions to take regarding travel in consultation with their doctors and their families. Not based on advise from an anonymous travel board.Like anyone else, I hope And this ends up not being a worst case scenario. However, it is spreading, it is killing people and only time will tell where this leads.Edited: 8:40 am, March 01, 2020 "
"And PSG played last night in front of over 45,000 people and Lyon will play St Ettiene with a crowd of over 60,000 tonight."
"I think it’s perfectly reasonable for people to be concerned, as the rate of spread is still unknown.Reports from the NYT suggest under - testing ( and faulty test kits) in the US.Don’t bother calling me a scaremonger, I too have 30 plus years as a healthcare professional. I have no idea how this is going to turn out and neither do all the so called ‘ experts’ on this forum. I have an Orlando holiday booked later in the year and hope to be going, but I’m certainly not going to trivialise this whole thing ."
"I still say where do you draw the line. France have decided on venues holding over 5000, be it indoor or outdoor, concert or sport, why is 5000 the magic number. If they are really trying to, prevent a spread surely it should be all venues regardless of number.Be interesting to see what Boris comes up with for the UK at the CORBA meeting tomorrow. Whst I would bet on though is that it he won’t say cancel all your holidays."
You can claim anything you want Mike. That’s the problem with the Internet. Did you know that I’m the grandson of the Crown Princess Anastasia who escaped the assassination making me next in line to the Russian Throne. TripAdvisor is not a place for medical discussions.
Agreed about the medical claim SDTOr should I call you your majesty..
"Anastasia, must be true , I’ve seen the movie.Edited: 9:47 am, March 01, 2020 "
i am concerned also. We plan to be in orlando on march 20 and visiting the parks . I am 71 and use an inhaler. we have our tickets to disney and one nights lodging on property.. we haven't made a decision of what to do yet.
BBC interviewed an official who said recently retired GP and RN MAY be called back into service.
The BBC irrelevant? They seem to have the same news as the ‘other’ news channels; I certainly haven’t noticed any differences!
"It was the Health Minister they interviewed about asking retired GP’s and Nurses to help out in the event of a Pandemic, I would say that’s directly from the horses mouth!"
What was said that if we end up with lots of doctors and nurses having to self quarantine then we might have to ask the retired to help out. I’m sure those elderly doctors and nurses will be delighted to be putting themselves right in the firing line!
"I’ m one of them but don’t class myself as ‘elderly’ thanks!( under 60, retired at 55!)And who are these ‘independent’ news outlets you speak of pray tell so that I can update myself!"

"Who is this Mike guy? Sounds like a Sunday down the pub has been ‘done’ considering these comments which are quite obnoxious and arrogant. Attention seeking on the penny of others with genuine concern over a real issue. That is sad.The concern about accessible healthcare sounds reasonable and with a big Italian and Chinese community in the US, I’d be worried. Not freaked but why take a risk you don’t have to."
"We are all going from Dublin for Easter week but am concerned too.The answers here seem to be a joke or treat it like some comedy, it worries me so people at Disneyland might not be serious either and this could be dangerous. We do not want to catch COVID because some idiot did not be careful.My family and yours are sacred. We bought masks with the little breathing thing in which I think is called a resperator. Do these work?"
"Reply to Traveller “Sorry but how does being a retired GP make you an expert on this virus?”Upon this particular strain, nowt. However thirty odd years of knowing behaviours and that non-specifically speaking the biggest concern isn’t the virus but the contagion by carrier(s), people. It will spread like any other before it but this time even intelligent people not knowing they are infected will accelerate reinfection rates, the R0 or R Nought is a major worry.Because of this infection risk criteria, the stealth characteristics and widespread ignorance of proper hygiene, and payload of the virus which apparently has mutated already. I am speaking from personal experience.I read a few comments and replies here tonight. There are some idiots online and these types, are a big part of the problem. Those with nothing to say should say nothing at all."

Can't wait to go to Coronado Springs on Thursday for 16 nights of Disney fun and absolutely no News or TV.
"mcjctcic, thank goodness for a sensible post. Go, enjoy yourself and of course follow any advise given but don’t let the panic mongers spoil your trip. I am not saying we should not be concerned but all this panic only makes for more panic and stress can be a killer too. This thread started with someone saying should they cancel their trip and it’s ended up a slanging match for those who think they know more than they do. Chill everyone. The parks are open for business, the planes are flying to the USA, When that changes that is the time to worry."
"Lived through SARS in Toronto, this seems a bit scarier. I think if it is like SARS it might burn out by the Summer, the problem is more air travel. We are hoping to go to Florida in November, decided against California.this May."
"This might be scarier but Corona is so much weaker and less life threatening that SARs. Because the majority of people just have a cold with this virus the transmission is much more wide spread compared to SARS. Some people don't even know they are sick. But it stops there, this is NOT SARS, SARS was much deadlier and serious virus. But it was also easier to contain because it was so obvious you were sick with something bad."
"This is me. We’re going in 8 weeks and I find myself checking the news at least every hour to see what’s happening. The anticipation I should be feeling, as we haven’t been for 13 years, has been superseded by worry and panic."
"Yes, very concerning. I don’t want to go to Orlando if Disney and universal studios are closed. I’m due to go in 4 weeks but not sure to try to postpone."
im going in 3 weeks and im really worried that they might close the parks x
"For me, we are going after Easter only planned to spend one day at Kennedy Space Center, but we are doing am 4000 Mile trip round the US also popping over to the Falls in Canada and Toronto. Also US Soccer game, and many other attractins. People should be concerned by this virus, mind you for me travelling on the Tube is more worrying. For me its the lack of info we are getting, what happens if you do get it, and how are hospitals treating it?I'm 57 and Suffer from Asthma :-(. Steph is 35 so i'm done for, she will be ok :-)Wearing masks is pointless, wea a hood, you are more protected.Its true about Americans who can't affford to get tested or go to the Doc's, they should offer Free Testing and maybe they will? But how do you test? A blood test or?I still plan to go on holiday, as for insurance, as its a ""act of God"" are we covered? If the flights are stopped then Yes we would get our money back on the flights. As for the Parks, Knowing Donald he could tell the parks to close, depends how bad the outbreak is in Florida?"
"Not trying to scare anyone, but I figured that this was relevant to this thread.Looks like some cases have appeared in Florida.https:/…ampart"
What is the population of Florida?
"The population is very large. over 20 million. Throw in a few million tourists from everywhere in the world, and you see why the spread will be hard to control. There are likely hundreds of cases with mild symptoms. Many people can’t or won’t see a doctor until they are very ill.Edited: 10:21 am, March 02, 2020 "
"If its ok for Ant & Dec in 6 weeks time, then i'm sure it will be fine :-)"
"Two cases in Florida outside of Orlando. 1 with known travel history to Italy. The 2nd with no travel history meaning they caught it locally. That part is worrisome.Governor has declared state of emergency but imho that’s more of a resource and funding move. But it also underscores the requirement for people to continue taking the basic precautions.Edited: 11:23 am, March 02, 2020 "
"What??? Watching the press conference today and FL Governor said they have tested 23 people for the virus. I read a little further and according to cdc 3 days ago across the US there have been under 500 total tests. That’s insane.For comparison in my province with a population of 5 million people there have been over 1300 tests.Edited: 11:51 am, March 02, 2020 "
I am more concerned about getting sun burnt than the coronavirus when i go.
"heh Warren, on a personal level that’s not unreasonable but problem is parks don’t close due to too much sun.Edited: 12:06 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"BA are BBC loving Tories, im not surprised they are involved in the scaremongering."
A lot of the flight cancellations are not directly due to the virus but to a huge drop in bookings as people are panicking and not booking trips.
"People are panicking because of watching news channels like the BBC, they fail to tell you the real facts."
"YarbogashvancouverI am hoping to go in the Fall, but I wont book anything unless I can get iron clad travel medical insurance. That is what the Canadian government is advising regarding travel anywhere right now. If I was an American and I could drive to Orlando in a day I would go, but until this blows over I don't want to be at an airport for a while.Getting my news from the CBC. If it does get worse the 6 will like Vancouver be in the thick of it."
"Hi WarrenSadly the BBC stopped reporting ""real facts"" years ago☹"
Yes Mike you are 100% correct.
"I would say if you would change your plans due to it being flu season, you should change your plans for the coronavirus. Otherwise, like every other communicable disease, practice safe hands.If it helps, there has been ZERO cases of a child below the age of 9 dying from coronavirus. I am also going in 2 weeks for spring break so if you stay home, less line wait for me!! :)"
"Wow, OP here (on my original name). Holy cow I figured Id just check to see if anyone else replied. I saw the first 5 replies then got busy. Over 100 replies!!!I am in Florida now. 2 cases here that I know of. One in Tampa, one in Sarasota. I just left RI on Saturday where there are 3 cases (all from a school trip to Italy). Seems many new cases popping up in the US are from Italy.I am not scared of catching this.I spoke with a friend who is an ER doctor. He said take vitamin C, echinacea, zinc and elderbery. These will greatly help you fight off getting the virus. Masks will not help. If going on a plane use Lysol wipes on seat, table, arm handles. Wash your hands frequently and do not touch your face.Children under 10 do not seem to get it.Elderly, more so men, and those with cardiac or respiratory disease are most likely to get this.Think about how many people live in China. In Wuhan alone, 11 million. 11 million and how many caught the virus? I agree more probably have it that didnt bother to see a doctor but it is still a low number considering how many live there. We cannot compare the US to China. Hygiene plays a huge part.To those trying to decide whether to go on your trip. If you feel uncomfortable going then cancel. If you think you'll be ok go.Everyone has to do what they feel is right for themselves or their family. I would never attempt to tell someone else what they should do. I can understand someone who is elderly or someone with respiratory illness worrying.We have decided to go. My family flies in on Saturday. We will keep an eye on things in the next 5 days. I do not see things changing greatly in that short a time.Lastly, panicking will not help anything. I pray this goes away as warmer weather comes and hopefully as few as possible die or get critically ill. Thank you to everyone who posted and to those arguing, please stop.Carry on...Edited: 9:40 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Nancyinri, your doctor friend is giving you terrible advice. Vitamin c is just necessary for good health regardless; you should be getting the necessary amount anyways. Zinc might help with recovery. None of those things will help you not catch the virus.And yes, kids under 10 can catch it. The effect has just proven to be minimal for children.I referenced the cdc before and am repeating it. Go to their website and get info directly."
"They help build your immune system. I am not saying taking those will absolutely keep you from getting it. If you feel this was implied by my post, my apologies. Noone can say who will get it and who will not.I have read multiple articles and also have read the CDC website.1% of children under 10 in China contracted Coronavirus. Most are elderly and for some reason more men than women. Hoping we can contain it better than China. Time will tell."
"WHO data is showing very few children under 10 even getting it, and all children who have had it have had mild symptoms. They are certainly going to look into that more, but it is not unheard of for children to be less affected by a virus. Even the more deadly, but much less wide spread, SARS in 2002-2003 hit children in a much lower degree of severity. We will see what happens. But nothing has changed in that most people, especially if you are under 50-years of age are mostly (vast majority) get a mild cold/flu and don't need any medical help. Everyone needs to stay health and wash their hands like they should every flu season. Though if I was in the demographic of higher risk it might be wise to keep an eye on the news and think about avoiding travel. Maybe. As for the flights, other than China, Italy and South Korea, flight are being cancelled due to lack of demand, not travel restrictions."
"Children under 10 are more likely to be infected than any other group for two reasons, they don't have personal space like older children and adults and they appear to be pretty much unaffected by the virus. My own (totally unscientific) opinion is smokers and even more so vapers will be hit the hardest. Vaping has been shown to be terrible when combined with viral infections of the lungs."
"As I said I am 57 and suffer from Asthma, This virus is bad, but a lot of it is guesswork and hope. We don't have a clue, how bad it will hit and where. The US could be one of the hardest, as people have to pay to see a doctor, to be tested. But we are going middle of April, and I ain't changing my plans. I will take my inhalers and the Emergency Rescue pack the Docs advise you to have, and please god, have am amazing holidayI thing I do wonder, as Asthma suffers get the Flu jab, does that help with avoiding this? A lot of people are cancelling their flights and holidays, and am surprised flights to New York have been cut back. All we can do is keep watching the news."
"According to the latest news in the UK a mass outbreak is now highly likely. Troops could be on the streets, towns and cities locked down, forceful detention .................. and people wonder why people are panicking! In the USA you have Donald telling everyone it's fine and it will go away in the Summer, think i prefer that option."
"That speech was IF it gets bad then what COULD happen. It's better to say the worst then you are better prepared. But as was said over and over again, ""we don't really know"" Yes Donald does seem to be talking it a bit to lightly That speech was meant to Calm people down, not stress us worrying the UK turning into am Episode of The Walking Dead. Cities could be locked down if it gets bad, and Sport could be stopped or played behind closed doors, but IF is a very small word with a massive meaning"
"Everyone should consult their doctor before taking any new vitamins or supplements. I choose to take Elderberry, Echinacea and Vit C to boost my immune system. I have no health issues.Those with autoimmune issues or high blood pressure shoukd not take echinacea so please consult your own physician about what you can do. We are all in this together!"
"I'm watching what major companies are doing in regards to cancelling conventions. If you google Google and Covid 19 you might think hmmmm there are a number of things getting cancelled here and there. We nixed California as it is a long flight and we don""t have enough time for everything. I don't plan on going to Orlando when the dance competitions, cheerleaders or grad parties are happening ( probably an even worse time for germs!) We were planning Universal, but you can't bring in your own food and that leaves you open to having to eat restaurant foods and let's face it lots of people will show up for work sick and pass it around to others before they know they are sick. So if you can't cancel and you will lose money you should go and probably sooner rather than later in this case is better. Safe Travels and have fun!"
"We leave for Florida Saturday. My thoughts are that my college aged girls are more at risk in their dorms or at a large indoor concert than at Disney. I’m bringing wipes and hand sanitizer, and knowing Disney, they will be taking precautions as well"
In our local Tesco the tinned food isle is al most bare. So either people will be well prepared or Tesco will see increase in profits! My guess is most who’ve bought will leave the tins in their cupboards to rot LOL

"Does anyone have any views or intel on whether Disney will keep parks open even if a cast member tests positive. I’m totally fine with the virus, I’m fit and healthy so will make a full recovery. I’m more anxious of paying a lot of money to sit in a villa with Disney on lock down!! Anyone able to help reduce my anxiety??? Please!"
Sorry but how on earth would any of us know that?
"There’s no way staff at the Operations level would be briefed or informed about any future decisions. That’s WAY too many people who could tell other people, then it gets into the press, then people make judgments (some apt, some not), then visits may decline, then the stock price tumbles, and so on. Not gonna happen. If Disney makes any substantial moves, they will send word down the chain of command on a Need To Know basis. No one will need to know until they need to start doing things differently."
"We have plans and reservations for WDW and Universal Studios among other activities in Orlando, five weeks from today. This includes air tickets, park tickets, accommodation, rental cars, shows and NBA tickets. Two parents and two kids 8 & 11 yo.I am not so concerned of getting sick, thank God we are all in good health and all. I am concerned about everything else though. Forget about parks closing, this sounds a remote possibility right now.What happens if someone in our group gets the virus and must stay at home while in Orlando? We will probably have to stick together. How will our hotel react? Can we stay in the hotel or not? What do we do for food?What happens if another passenger in our flight is diagnosed with the virus? There is a chance that those seated near him will be quarantined. Again, where will the quarantine be?So, replying to the OP yes, I am concerned. I am trying to find the ""point of no return"" date so I can minimize on cancellation costs.I have no idea if WDW, Universal, Delta, Hilton, Alamo and everybody else expecting to collect from our trip reads this, but I wish that the tourism industry relaxed its cancellation fees policies, so that we can choose to proceed or abort even last minute. So far only a few providers have demonstrated such sensitivities.If I lose a lot of money because of cancellation fees for such a reason, this will affect my decisions to schedule and pay in advance for leisure travel in the future.Let's hope that things cool down, and please keep such concerns away from our kids' ears."
"As someone else said, just wish the airlines and parks were giving people more flexibility with what they decide to do (relax change fees/cancellation policies for flights and tickets). I understand this is not best from a business perspective, but if airlines stated you could reschedule your flight for free and give you a credit for 2020 (right now most airlines are only letting you change your flight if you booked in March not earlier) or would let you use park tickets at a later date (not sure the policy on this), it would be very helpful.My husband was supposed to attend a conference in orlando in a few weeks. I personally don't think the conference should go on, but regardless his company announced they are not letting their employees do any non-essential travel (including conferences). Sure his company would have to pick up the brunt of the cost of the conference, but we were planning on making a vacation out of it, and I will end up losing my money on my flight ticket (and most likely the conference park tickets we had). He also had a conference rate at a disney hotel (and his company obviously wouldn't pick this up now).Personally, I think its safer to wait until this blows over to go to Disney, but I can't see this being an easy process with getting all my money back. It is very frustrating to even try to postpone your trip right now!"
"@Mike-CYes, we have already paid for travel insurance including trip cancellation or curtailment as they call it.Won't cover our expenses if we simply change our mind about travelling last minute.If we reach Orlando and our plans are smashed due to attractions closing, quarantine or whatever else, I have no idea what the insurance will cover, but I would prefer to have a choice on taking the risk or not. I work in the aviation industry and fully perceive the revenue loss headache if travelers are allowed to cancel with no cancellation fees. Nevertheless I strongly believe that the tourism industry should pick up whatever tab is required to provide travelers with a choice in such an extreme case."
"""Holiday Insurance?"" I mean sure, now that looks like a great idea now, but the only type that protects you is the ""cancel for no reason"" insurance and that can be extremely expensive (not worth it for a 250 flight). I didn't expect something like this to happen when booking about 7 months ago..."
“”Nevertheless I strongly believe that the tourism industry should pick up whatever tab is required to provide travelers with a choice in such an extreme case.””Do you honestly think they can afford to do that??I don’t..
"“”""Holiday Insurance?"" I mean sure, now that looks like a great idea now,””We have 12 month cover, in fact we just renewed it today. It’s gone up slightly, but nothing dramatic.."
"A lot of people in the US ""self insure"" for trips within the US. I have never taken out insurance on a trip to Disney. It doesn't make sense, the risk of loss is so small. (Many get something pretty basic with their credit card anyway).It's more common for us to buy insurance on overseas trips, or extremely expensive trips, not a cheap flight to Orlando. When you aren't relying on a ""package"" from one operator, it is pretty easy to mitigate hotel loss with refundable rates. Status can mitigate airline loss. Disney is pretty good about working with you on tickets. It's a completely different kind of trip when you can manage each piece like that."
Yes we are back up and running - I was getting withdrawal symptoms!Regarding insurance the trouble is the vast majority will only cover you if the government say ps do not travel the area you are going. They would not say cover you if just the parks were closed. So Disney could follow orders and close a park but keep their hotels open.
Given the transmission rate I wonder if they will provide more space in the line ups? Being trapped in a line with somebody coughing for whatever reason would be kind of nerve wracking maybe they will use the ropes in a way that there is a row between people.
"My grandkids have coughs but not Coronavirus. Kids always have runny noses or a cold. It doesn't seem to be spreading quickly in the US right now. I am really hoping it dies down with warmer weather but no telling what will happen. I just wish the media would stop causing panic and hysteria. Informing is one thing, sensationalizing is another.We leave for Disney tomorrow. I'll let you all know how it goes. :)"
"@nancyinRII am pretty sure your plans are early enough, before this turmoil reaches its peak so you'll be just fine.Have a good time!"
"“Warmer weather kills Coronavirus“.A lie. It slows transmission but does not kill the virus.Tenerife in the Canary Islands, current temperature 24’C, virus active and hotels are on lockdown. Infections, six."
91-DVOc 2 posts on the coronavirus posts only. So as an expert perhaps change your name to covid19?
Actually hotels aren’t in “lock down” in Tenerife- my friends came home yesterday - everyone is carrying on as normal out there
"Your friend is lucky they were not staying at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, since it is under quarantine.Sorry, but that’s not “normal.” Of course it’s also not “all hotels are on lockdown” either. Get your information about this elsewhere. TripAdvisor is great for hotel tips and fast pass questions, but NOT information on a virus.Edited: 8:16 am, March 05, 2020 "
If this is true it’s almost like the state of Florida does not want to know how many cases they have.https:/…amp
"We dont go for another 7 weeks, not worried at all will take hand sanitiser with us and wash hands regularly the only thing that worries me is if it does get far worse Disney or universal may have to shut the parks but we will deal with that if it happensEdited: 8:44 am, March 05, 2020 "
"91DIVOC I never said warm weather WOULD kill the virus, I said I HOPED it would. Nice way to misrepresent. SMHYarbogash I think Florida is afraid they will overwhelm their labs and there is also a worry of not enough test kits right now. I had a virus that was flu like in early January. Fever, bad cough. I had it for 3 weeks. There are so many flu's and viruses around. If they checked every person walking in the door with those symptoms it would be nuts.This is taken from the article you posted: ""Instead, Florida’s health leaders advised doctors to order tests only for people who fit a more narrow criteria: a history of travel to a high-risk area, or close contact with a confirmed coronavirus patient within 14 days of showing symptoms.Why? Florida officials are concerned the state’s three labs — in Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa — would be overwhelmed by the number of tests, slowing the entire process.Officials with the Florida Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment about not testing under the expanded guidelines. “We will work with CDC if we reach an overwhelming volume of tests,” said Alberto Moscoso, communications director with the Florida Department of Health.""So if we only read the title of the article you would believe Florida is trying to hide something . This is how rumors are spread and again how the media spreads panic and hysteria. Perfect example of misrepresentation or you get misinformation like above for Tenerife. You have to sift through and find the truth."
"Nancyinri, I understand their stated intent. That’s why I posted the link to the article, so people could read it for themselves.No matter how they try to spin it the end result is the same. Instead of ramping up testing they are continuing with the same regime. Instead of immediately adding lab capacity or sending work out of state. Are they really not doing that? Again, it’s mind boggling. If their system sucks that much then I guess so be it."
"Classed as "" Am act of God"" only change getting money back is, if the FCO say ""Don't fly to the US"" but hotels or the rental company don't have to give you your money back. A lot of our hotels are done by Booking.com, so can cancel for free. Don't think Travel Insurance will pay you back, maybe you can get money back on the credit card if you used it"
"And nancyinri, that rant is not aimed at you. I’m just frustrated. As I’ve noted before between where I live and FL where we are headed in a couple there seems to be very different resources and strategies in play to deal with this. Hoping it works out best for everyone."
Yarbogash I didn't take it as towards me. I am not one who gets offended easily and takes things personal lolI understand the frustration and absolutely agree that they were not ready nor equipped for this but then I worked in healthcare and understand they cannot be ready for everything. Their first mistake was allowing people in from Italy without quarantining them.Now everyone can self quarantine. That is not working out too well. A medical student (no less) decided to go out to a bar and show knowing he had it.  Others have to work to put food on the table and cannot go without. We can't control it unfortunately. This will not be the last virus that can kill. I am thankful it is not like Ebola or worse.I am also frustrated by the media always blowing everything up instead of being calm and giving precise directions. I head to Disney today and go to Epcot tomorrow. Will let everyone know how it is. I thought I read somewhere they were going to set up hand sanitizer stations around the parks?
"That is not working out too well. A medical student (no less) decided to go out to a bar and show knowing he had it. Bloke should be kicked out of the medical profession, and fined heavily"
Oh wow!
We changed lots of plans because of it.
"Can""t let that happen!! sorry."
"Travelyn what did you have to change?Edited: 5:06 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"nancyinRIEver since Covid 19 was announced we have been changing our plans, our first plans included going to Vancouver and then L.A. Then we changed partially because we were worried about the long flight and because we could not imagine going if Indiana Jones ride was going to be closed. Then we thought we would go to Orlando, but all the news got worse and airports were still a concern. It is a huge struggle to get away and we have a vulnerable family member and we can't risk being quarantined. So all this really has thrown a wrench in our long waited plans."
Im so sorry this has affected your plans. Better to be safe than sorry. Hooe you can reschedule.
"Yes, we are booked to go in April. Flying from Miami flights were always around US$110, went up some weeks ago and now all flights are US$50.When I called American airlines they said prices are always subject to change and is not related to the virus. hmmmEdited: 4:41 am, March 07, 2020 "
"We fly April 14th, if I cancel we lose 2k each, I think if we are sensible then we can avoid it, as the only really busy place we are going is Kennedy Space Center, can't see Graceland or things in New Orleans being affected to much. The worry for me is someone in a hotel being found to have it, but in the US you have to pay for the tests, and I can't see many people paying to be tested. I don't want to be quarantined for a week, but after speaking to a few US friends, they are not even checking people flying in from Italy, not even asking any questions. I see we are going, but in a few weeks who knows how bad it will be, or maybe as the US is so far away from Italy, it might not get much worse? At the moment we finish with 5 days in New York, now that is more of a worryA young girl who was in Rome, and who lives in Malta has just tested Pos, so young kids CAN get it. I suppose if I had kids I would cancel. What I can't understand is WHY Italy is the center of it all, and other countries who are on the border like Switzerland, Spain, are not as bad? There are so many unanswered questions, which I think is making people panic moreEdited: 5:41 am, March 07, 2020 "
"We head home tomorrow. Disney was packed from Saturday (2/29) until Wednesday (3/4) when there was a noticeable dip in the crowds.Universal (arrived 3/5) has been quieter, not dead, but not as busy as this time last year. I’m extremely happy that we opted out of a $$$$ Premier resort. Sapphire Falls is lovely and we really haven’t missed Express at all.We stocked up on hand sanitizer and are stopping off to wash hands a lot but otherwise have been carrying on as we usually do.I have a late May/early June trip booked and have no plans to cancel.Edited: 7:21 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I was wondering how it would work if the UK government cancelled flights to Orlando ( if they had a big outbreak which they don't yet) but the parks were still open. This would mean UK visitors could not get there even though if they did everything was business as usual;. Would Disney, being an American company and not obliged to follow UK rules, give refunds, allow holidays to be rebooked? We have booked direct with Disney but through the UK site so hopefully they have to abide by what the UK government does. On the other hand not going until Sept so hopefully it will all be over by then"
Lazza are you traveling from Italy? The CDC is asking all travelers from Italy to self quarantine for two weeks. My work and others are enforcing this. Your friends are wrong that the US is not doing anything about people traveling from Italy. Who knows what the rules will be next month. They may be more strict than a volunteer self quarantine.Please follow the CDC for accurate information.
What about the car rental companies? We fly into Orlando then start our trip finishing in New York
"That's good, but a lot of it is down to the person to be trusted to self isolate Nope i'm in London Town, flying from Gatwick Was just worried that people were flying in from Italy and zero was being done. But are you not tested at the Airport if you arrive from Italy?"
I phoned Disney Uk with my worries about the trip and they said they were currently dealing with a lot of calls because Flybe had collapsed and in cases like this of course they would allow flexibility in cancelling or rescheduling holidays.We have booked flights and Disney accommodation tickets etc separately. It says in terms and conditions we can cancel up to 7 days before with only cancellation feees of 50 pounds per person. So I think we all just have to wait and se what happens .
Very crowded on the ground In Hollywood Studios...only effect is long lines at the sinks and two ladies rooms with empty paper towel machines.
"I saw in the paper today that three major trade shows scheduled for Orlando have been cancelled. Also 2 large music festivals, one in Miami and one in Austin were cancelled. Only time will tell if this is an overreaction, but it sure is hitting the economy in these places."
"I hope the Parks are open early April otherwise, ""it won't be a Ticket to the Plane to Orlando"" on Takeaway, but instead a week in Blackpool :-(Last Year Ant was on the booze, this year this Virus, ITV must be cacking themselves if the Parks will be closed"
"A co-worker of mine returned from Italy 13 days ago, he’d been there for two weeks. He said he was screened for fever on Flight from Italy to Switzerland, but not upon entering the US. Maybe this has changed by now (hopefully). Was never asked to self quarantine."
"We are travelling next month internationally from a country with only a handful of cases, so my current plans are to still go but build up our overall immunity now, and take a lot of extra precautions around hygiene and hand washing until then and while away. I don’t want to be denied entry to flights, hotels or parks due to picking up a common cold or seasonal flu. My biggest concern is Disney closing or us being quarantined while away. I’m quite prepared for a company required self quarantine upon return as lots of businesses have introduced this."
"I have not heard of people being tested here upon arrival to the US from Italy.Right now they expect people to self isolate.I agree, this will not happen in all cases. Some will still be out and about while sick with mild symptoms while others may not even know they have it.I feel fairly safe being here at Disney and in airports/planes.I am scheduled to fly home the 18th and return to Florida late April (not Disney).Will see how things are then. Right now things are busy here at Disney.My son and family flew in yesterday. Only one person in entire airport had a mask on.No big worry here yet. Besides big companies canceling known conventions life seems to be going on as usual for the time being."
"Mike it would be peeps who have booked an indirect ticket, likely from regional airport, connecting to transatlantic flight. Could quite easily be via France as plenty of Air France indirect tickets actually used Flybe to get the passengers to France first."
"Marilyn - actually that way round is the best. Providing you have good travel insurance if government advice is not to travel then travel insurance would cover every part.However worse is parks closed but no travel advice ban. Then travel insurance would not cover you. So even if booked with Disney and they were told to close the parks they may say but you have a hotel booking and we’d be delighted still to see you. You may either be able to cancel your Disney stay. Another post says if done over 7 days ahead you’d just be charged £50 per person cancellation fee, so I’d hope this means they would refund other paid money. Another possibility is Disney might allow a booking to be deferred, for me this would need to be a year but you never know."
"lineandalan, I appriceate what you say but you unless you have the extra for travel disruption on your insurance they still won't pay out. Fortunately we did add it in case of hurricanes more than anything else. Might turn out to be the best £36 we spent if we need it."
"Yeah I agree Mike. Anyway surely somebody saw they’d be stung by the bee in the end!Marilyn I get money can be tight, but if you are spending the many thousands on a Florida trip but can not afford a real travel insurance policy you shouldn’t be going in the first place. Far too many people search for the cheapest policy (not just travel insurance) then when it comes to claim either find they do not have right insurance or are with an insurer that tries everything they can to avoid paying. Many a time people say to me thing like but £400 for house insurance is way more than I pay. But when something happens I get paid out and dealt with in a fair manner. At the moment the garage next to mine was set in fire 3 weeks ago for instance. Mine has been assessed and the roof tested for asbestos and to be removed and all contents replaced before next doors has even had assessor out yet. Needless to say I’m getting quotes for theirs to be sorted as no doubt their insurer will eventually agree. But you get my point."
"You will only get paid out if the FCO advise you not to travel to Orlando, and flights are stopped. I agree with what you said to a point, but my car insurance is around the same as the others, but when i needed them in the 1st year i was with them, they were brilliant"
"Sorry lineandalan, not sure what you are getting at.When I said I paid £36 that was an add on to cover for travel disruption.The actual insurance was over £300 and covers everything but they still won’t pay out unless the government says you cannot go. Having been taken ill 3 years ago in Orlando and the insurance having to settle a bill of around $40000 ( which they did with no problem) I would never go to the USA without proper cover."
"Indeed £300 is what I’d consider likely a proper policy. However there are lots that are a far lot cheaper than that. I took it to be an add on as said rather than the actual policy. Not ever suggesting yours was not right, but for others to make sure they have the right cover.When the ash cloud happened I know a family that were paid to stay and carry on enjoying their time. But anither family whose insurance said not covered. As for car insurance, if it’s a clear case you’d expect any insurer to pay out. There is not so many things to car insurance as opposed to travel and home."
"And update, British Columbia with its population of 5 mill, has now done over 2300 tests. Across all of the US there have been 2000 to 5000 tests done but it’s hard to know the exact total as the government is hiding that info. https:/…And in Florida the testing rate is well below the national average. 11 Florida residents have tested positive for COVID-19, along with five repatriated citizens and one non-resident in the state. 2 have died from the virus. Since the mortality rate is about 2-3 % on that math alone it means there’s likely at least 80 more people in Florida with the virus. Given the timelines and transmission ratios a conservative estimate would be 4 times, so about 350 to 400."
"Mortality is running generally at 2-3% of reported cases, you cannot take from that how many others may or may not have it."
"lineandalan, true you can’t get an exact number but it’s a strong indicator that the number of confirmed cases is underreported. Was the same with Iran reporting so many deaths initially and a corresponding low number of confirmed cases. Raised the fear they were under reporting and imho that’s been proven out.For Florida the sample size is so small that there will be irregularity in those odds but given what we know I think I made the best guess possible.There’s 70 or 80 tests pending right now when there should be thousands. So gonna be a while before we know for sure what the real numbers are."
I read that the actual number should be 5.7%. I am very worried about any airports or air travel. I am really sad about all this I love Orlando!I hate this virus it is really putting a kink in my plans.!I think some of the health agencies around the world have actually started discussions about food service workers. Until that risk is looked into I am really hesitant to travel. I will be watching how things go and hopefully it clears up in the near future.
"According to UK medical experts they expect the virus to peak around April / May, then die off in the warmer weather but could make a return around November when it gets cold again. We are due to visit Disney in Sept so hopefully we will be between the outbreaks and with a bit of luck they will have a vaccine ready by Nov so we can all get a shot like with the flu."
No vaccine for 12-18 months
"That’s not good news.. just FaceTimed our son who lives in Orlando and he says so far everything seems to be business as usual. There has been a bit of panic buying but the parks are as busy as ever ,everything is open and shows no sign of visitors staying away."
"As coaster fanatic says it is medically impossible to have a vaccine to a novel virus in less than a year.And who knows if it will “die off” in the summer. Actually it does not die off but some acquire immunity after silent infections and it’s less prevalent. But covid 19 is new, that may not happen."
"“... then die off in the warmer weather but could make a return around November when it gets cold again.”Fact Check: COVID-19 survives outside of the human body at temperatures below 60’C, the transmission rate is expected to be lower during warmer seasons but contrary to Mr Trump’s comment it will still be around and very much alive. Even in Devils Canyon, the Sahara Desert and more."
"I don't know about other airlines, but Jetblue is allowing folks to cancel reservations made starting 3/6 for travel through September for no penalty.Edited: 9:35 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Note that with Jet Blue, yes you can cancel with no penalty, but you don't get the money back. It goes into your ""travel bank"" to be used within the year. Of course I booked my Bahamas trip for May in late Jan. so mine is not covered."
Mike.Have you noticed their user name?Disgraceful.
"Delta just announced that they will waive change fees for tickets issued on or before March 9th for international/domestic travel between 3/1-4/30. Let’s hope other carriers will follow.https:/…1237087408618983424Doesn’t look like a lot of good news on the hotel front for those with advanced purchase non refundable reservations. So far only Hyatt offering 10k points for cancelled travel booked through June 30, 2020.https:/…"
Rosen Hyatt was nice enough to refund my friends non refundable rate in the east coast next week since we cancelled our spring break trip. Nice to see Hyatt has made this a policy.
"To my knowledge, full refund of cancelled non refundable reservations is not Hyatt’s policy, at least not currently. What they are saying in their statement is that they will give you a compensation of 10k points (not a full refund) if you cancel non refundable booking. It’s not much but they are under no obligation to give you anything so it’s what I would call a nice gesture. If your friend received full refund on a cancelled non refundable reservation then she/he was lucky and they went well above and beyond (which is nice!) but that is currently not their official policy."
Ok thanks!
"We're supposed to be going to Orlando in 8 weeks. DisneyWorld, LegolandWe're a family of 5. Kids are 5, 3 & 6 1/2 weeks old. We're considering cancelling. Coronavirus situation WILL NOT improve during that time, we all know that. It seems to be spreading at a rate of 10 fold every 3 weeks. I'm waiting to see what the situation is like about 2 weeks out. Will we even be able to fly?Will parks be closed?"
"Been reading reports from doctors in Italy. Cripes, what a mess. https:/…Not going to be posting here for a while. Too much going on at home. Preparing at work now (hoping authorities delay the cruise season because our officers will be front line with those passengers) and at home. Best wishes all."
Craig S-CanadaI would really consider canceling. What would happen to your kids if you and your wife got sick!
"Agree, Mike. We just booked an adults long weekend for early June!"
"We leave for Orlando in less than a week. Three cases just announced in my home state. Flying out of Cleveland Hopkins on Monday, and from what I can gather from the news article I read, all three people returned to Ohio through Cleveland Hopkins with the virus. Scary stuff. Praying that things start to improve and that we don't contract the virus and give it to anyone else. ☹️"
"I have just hung up the phone with Disney regarding our tickets for WDW five weeks from now.Just wanted to investigate our options changing our three day base tickets.It seems there are none. The lady said that since parks are open they stick to their terms, no cancellations or date changes.Changing our trip for September would involve 4.400 USD air tickets from Home to Orlando and back , 1.500 USD accommodation, 3.500 USD Park tickets and another 1.000 USD for additional booked tours.If we are not provided with the flexibility to reschedule our entire trip, the only thing we can do is proceed and hope for the best.I fear that this may be a total waste of money. And huge disappointment for kids and grown up alike."
Friends were there at the weekend and said it was as busy as ever.
Why will it be a waste of money and a disappointment? If you aren’t elderly or have a compromised immune system you will be fine. Even if you were to catch it you would most likely have mild symptoms. Disney parks are running as normal. No reason you can’t still have a good time. Just wash your hands often and don’t touch your face.
"Agree with Tenni..As I've already said ""The level of panic is quite amazing"""
It won't be a disappointment or waste of money . . . the parks are open and functioning like normal. You will all have a great time!
"Guys, too many things can go wrong. Our friends who have booked tickets with Alitalia using Milan Airport as a hub, were notified that all flights to Milan are being cancelled for the next three weeks. No ticket refunds , just rescheduling but this is not feasible for the rest of the bookings.Our flight is with Turkish Airlines, no idea if they will continue to fly into the US. I just wish all reservations for Orlando , parks, hotels, tours, air tickets were made more flexible so we could decide with ease of mind, instead of a leap of faith. Thank you for the positive energy, hope it helps."
"Waiting for the Magical a Express. The past 5 days were just as busy as my last trip in December. People are not staying away, nor should they. I’m excited that our next trip is only 6 weeks away. They were even doing the finger scans the past two days and would not accept IDs instead, despite what some of the blogs have been reporting."
You could get hit by a bus on your way to work tomorrow. Something could always go wrong. Disney isn’t going to shut down unless they absolutely have to. This is a good lesson in cancel for any reason insurance.
"We are due to fly on this Friday from Europe (Austria to Orlando), for a week long holiday. The only thing that worries me is not catching corona virus itself (we are healthy and have about the same chance of catching it at home than in FL), but if anybody else is infected then the whole hotel will be put on 14 days quarantine and will be forced to prolong our ""holiday"". One of the things I am really considering is to book instead of 7 night in one hotel, few different hotels throughout the week - just in case:)) As we are young couple with no health problems we should be fine, but its the others I am a bit worried about. But the excitement about holiday is stronger than worries about corona. I see the park going on full blast, hopefully everything will be ok and as long out flight are not canceled I'll be there in few days! :)"
"While I understand the perspective of those who aren’t concerned because they themselves don’t fall into one of the high risk categories, I feel it prudent to mention the following...This virus has shown to be contagious in those who do not exhibit symptoms. While Florida doesn’t have many cases right now, chances are you will come into contact with someone who has it either on the trip to Florida or while you’re in the parks. Suppose you contract the virus but don’t have symptoms? Or think you just have a cold? Do you have any elderly or immune-compromised people in your family? Your community? Your place of work?I’m not saying to stop living your life. But, at this point with community spread happening in the US, we need to think not only of ourselves, but our communities at large. I have elderly parents who we see quite often. I’ve made the decision at this point in time to avoid situations that could result in my putting them at risk. Still living life, but being more aware for now. We haven’t scheduled this summer’s vacation yet either. There’s plenty of time for vacations, but I feel we have to use what we know now to try to contain this rotten virus.Just another perspective to consider."
Craig SGetting sick in Canada where you and your family are citizens with 3 young children is one thing. Being in another country away from family who could care for them is another.
Different kind of situation. Already in Orlando @ a timeshare we rented for 1 month. Fall in the elderly immunocompromised high risk category. Would you try changing flight to sooner (now scheduled for 3/29) losing $ on timeshare & also flight charge. Possibility also trying to keep (or rent a new) car rental dropping off in our home state. Drive would take 3 night in different hotels along the way. Or....could find another place (cannot stay in this timeshare) in Florida to stay...not necessarily in Orlando. $ is not as big of an issue as safety. Any comments greatly appreciated.

"Julie I feel for you. I sent a pm. Travel is a personal decision but you were already traveling when this escalated. I would suggest practice social distancing and hand hygiene, and if you already have the car , disinfect it and drive home. I wish you the best."
Thank you Octoberitaly. Valuable advice!
"News from Greece. Last night the Greek Health Ministry announced that all educational facilities in the country are shut down for the next 14 days.The reason is that experience in our close neighbouring country Italy (Italy has been hammered by the virus) shows that children contract the virus without showing any signs at all. Furthermore younger kids cannot follow strict hygiene rules as well as older people. For those reasons they carry the virus undetected and give out significant doses to all others.(Pardon my English, I am no doctor)So, the Greek State shut down all educational and day care units for kids aged 3-18 years old, all universities and colleges, all vocational training schools and so on.I have no intention to cause panic, I am just relaying information we received last night from the Greek State, who claimed they had extensive discussions with the Italian State.The situation is still evolving and there are still unknown aspects on Covid 19."
"Marion.In a word...""no""!!!!"
"Well I’mBuzzing to go on 29th April!!! Unless the uk stops flights or us stops allowing flights I’ll be going , worse case my tour operator will just move it to later in the year :-)"
"Unfortunately or otherwise, I'm following this, probably more than any other research. We are a family of four, from India, and this may well be a once-in-a-lifetime-trip. More importantly, my daughter is to take a weekend high school workshop to help prepare for her College admissions later this year. Plus, cheap tickets means the least refund, plus the disappointment. But all this will pale in the face of a real threat to health, so following threads. But I find a saner and more balanced opinion here than other travel sites, and have alwways relied on TA to plan my trips, so please keep the updates coming."
"i have friends currently in orlando who have reported nothing seems to be a issue and no real concern at the moment , flight with BA was half full into tampa however there hotel has told them they have in the last couple of days had 350 cancellations so clearly people are concerned. i think the next few days /week will see it peak and then for places like the states more information can be gathered. clearly very different for people in Europe where it is on the news 24/7 so be patient with peoples posts as currently its all we are hearing in the uk/europe . hopefully new outbreaks will be quarantined properly to stem the infection from increasing . Keep safe and enjoy your travels."
"YESWhat is wrong with people posting in for advice and people replying trying to advise and help others?I am am Asthma suffer, I find it interesting that people who are rushed into hospital are given Ventolin, to open the airwaves. Also people who have never had Asthma to suddenly not be able to breath normally must be very scary. But for Asthma suffers we would be better prepared and have the Ventolin to hand. That is what a few fellow Asthma suffers feel?"
"For people who are sick of this topic-stop reading it then! There are plenty of people worried about traveling but also not wanting to cancel if they do not have to so try to be a little patient and compassionate. Scroll and roll whiners.I just returned from my five day stay at the Swan yesterday. People may be canceling later vacations but I can tell you the parks were packed this week. Many lines for rides and if there are many canceling it was not evident.Epcot and Animal Kingdom were full of employees seen cleaning benches, even garbage containers and more around in general to help vacationers. Magic Kingdom not so much. Barely an hand sanitizers there and what was some were empty. Magic kingdom was not so magical to us."
Mike is right!None of us on here are virology experts (I'm guessing)!!!
Some of us are in healthcare and it’s valuable to share what we are experiencing. You should see the restrictions they have at my work.
"Well I am interested in this thread. I was due to travel to Orlando on 18th April and have been completely put off going with what is going on in Italy and probably soon the UK. As an asthma sufferer, I frequently seem to catch flu when I travel and it flairs up my asthma and I am sick for weeks so I certainly don't want to risk getting this as I seem to catch anything going. Also, I am very concerned at the small number of tests that have been completed in the US vs Europe and the UK - I don't really have any faith in the numbers quoted as they have barely tested vs the size of the population. As for people saying they don't understand what the panic is for - have you actually read what it has been like in Italy in the hospitals, it sounds like the medical staff are overwhelmed and are literally having to pick who to try to save and who to let die. I am so shocked at the lack of concern that some people seem to have at what is going on."
"""""Some of us are in healthcare and it’s valuable to share what we are experiencing.""""Very true, but sorting out the wheat from the chaff is impossible..Now I'm not doubting you at all, though ""other"" posters who have popped up recently (especially the ones with stupid names) do we listen to those??I still say this is ""not"" the place for these sort of discussions.."
"I go in April, only started to get worried. Not about getting an extremely mild virus but incase the weirdos cancel my flight."
Being in healthcare doesn't mean anything. People need to stick with the WHO and the CDC for factual information and check with their doctors on their specific circumstances. https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirushttps:/…summary.html
I think this is a place for people to talk about this. People want to travel and are concerned too. We have family coming back from NYC this week and we are worried about them and if there are problems or restrictions at airports in NYC and here in Toronto. We are still hoping to travel but are postponing booking which in our case makes sense. I do hope that all the park goers give each other space in line.
"Poster 281.Please read post 280 and you will find links to all the official information!Thank you!Edited: 3:31 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We were going to Epcot, we cancelled. Stay out of crowds"
"I agree that the panic is rampant and IMHO, not called for, yet. I am more concerned now that Trump has cancelled European travel for 30 days short of UK. Not concerned about the virus, but for the likely snowball effect this will have on the panic stricken. Common sense would mandate we all postpone any unnecessary travel & group gatherings, but I am still on go for our May trip as long as the park is still open.I'm certainly rethinking my never ""wasting money"" on buying travel insurance policy. I hope most businesses will rethink their cancellation/refund policies and provide relief for folks caught in the middle. Businesses should realize that good will demonstrated now will hopefully be remembered later with this clears. I realize businesses are only responsible to abide by the rules stated at time of purchase, but it can be better in the long run to treat people better than expected/required. Surely those from Europe who cannot travel in to complete holidays will receive some relief from places like Disney and other big players."
I think a number of people are going to be in shock if they are leaving from the EU.
"We just left The Magic Kingdom a couple hours ago, what a disappointment in customer care. They are doing NOTHING to help stop the spread of Covid 19. I was expecting hand sanitizer at the exits of rides, but all I saw was one hand sanitizer station at the very exit of the park! The bathrooms were dirty, and I didn’t see any attempts being made to clean off seats, hand rails, etc. I honestly don’t see how much longer they can keep their gates open during this pandemic."
"Well, in spite of Marion's & Traveller's from UK dismay to my previous ""long post"" with their replies #267 & #268, exactly what I was concerned about has happened.The US Administration has banned travel from Continental Europe to the US for 30 days, so we cannot fly in with our tickets early April. Period. UK is still in the clear, but Marion is probably in better position to explain why there is no reason for Brits to be concerned.Besides airfares and tickets to WDW, we have non-refundable bookings to Universal, Blue Man, an Orlando Magics NBA game, the Hotel and other attractions. NBA games have also been cancelled until further notice.I am somehow concerned about my family and friends getting sick from the virus here at my hometown in Greece, but I am also concerned facing the denial af all business entities to refund our tickets and allow us to reschedule next year."
Blu...i asked if anyone had read these long posts. Some did...I didn't so I have no idea what you were posting
"Picotoller I agree 100%! We were very disappointed in Magic Kingdom this time! We saw one sanitizer stand and it was empty. There were no employees around to help with questions unless you wanted to wait in line at one of two little stands set in the park with one employee to answer your question. Magic Kingdom has gone greatly downhill and looked old and rundown. The only great part is their parade.As for the travel ban, US Citizens are still coming and going so not sure how this helps keep the virus contained as our citizens can still bring it back."
There are some on this forum that are just basically really awful people.  I would hope that the theme parks will be offering extensions on park tickets bought as the EU travellers are faultless in this.
Someone pointed out that if you are in mainland Europe and want to fly to the US you could fly to UK or Ireland and then get a flight from there. Would they know? They don't stamp a passport when you leave a country so if you went from Greece to UK and then a flight to Orlando would that work? It would cost more sure but at least you could still travel or would the fact that you had a Greek passport stop you from entering.
"PicotollerLouisville, ColoradoFrom what I am reading it sounds like the theme parks are not providing enough hand sanitizers, which is scary. I am also wondering if they are providing more space in lines llike alternating empty lines using the rope systems they have."

"Based on the wording of the order, having a Greek passport would not prevent entry into the US, being in Greece in the past 14 days would. The obvious workaround is to fly into the UK, stay there for 14 days and then on to the US...I will leave to others to decide how safe and sound (not to mention effective) this order really is."
"It will be interesting to see what further measures the parks take and also what sort of compassion they extend to guests from EU in regards to passes that may expire before being used. I am so glad that we did not buy passes and we nearly did as they had a Canadian deal and normally I buy that every year, but this year when we heard about this thing we decided against it...So many of us are huge Disney Fans and do so much to get there, I think I'm really going to wait and see what happens when it hits Florida and how it is handled before I go back. Might be the year to staycation."
My grandson's pediatrician said with his asthma and allergies he's probably better off in Florida than where we live in Oklahoma with so many allergens. She said go!

"Hi Everyone.We are in AZ on Spring Break & believe me DL was tempting. Supposedly never rains in Phoenix; well guess what. Sitting here watching the rain come down on my “Spring Break,” and doing some Disney Dreaming. My daughter’s University in Texas has extended the break by a week & after that online classes only thru the end of the month. What was all fun and games: saw the Grand Canyon for the first time! Made the rounds, Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Canyon, etc, is beginning to feel like an exile as we try to determine whether to stay put or fly back to TX.It is a feeling of impending doom and should I stay or should I go, while the going is a possibility. No surprise to me that anyplace that draws large crowds like Disney, would be a no go. Its everywhere now. Pretty alarming. And when our president announced no incoming flights from Europe, that was a jolt. I have family scattered all over. Near a hospital in AZ, but (no offense to Phoenix) I might feel more comfortable near the good old Texas Medical Center in Houston. I’ve stopped mail delivery back home. Now I need to resolve what to do with my sweet dog. She was left boarded at the vet. Flight on Sunday morning, if we choose to head back home. Worried that panic will begin to set in.Edited: 5:33 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We are heading to WDW tomorrow morning from Toronto as has been the plan since 7 months ago. Wish it were under more positive circumstances but at this point, it's a go for us."
"Disney in CA has just announced they are closing until the end of March. Disneyland Paris has shut down parades and all indoors attractions.WDW is the only Disney Park in the world still ignoring the plain truth and going on , business as usual.They should allow everybody to get a refund if we decide not to visit their parks, not put pressure on park visitors to visit the park or lose their money.After all, even ticket rescheduling until the end of the year may not be an option for many of us, especially for those flying in from across the ocean."
"Manish P,Have a good safe trip and by the way in case you don't know yet all Ontario public schools will be closed now from March 14 to April 5th in order to quarantine kids at home when they come back from their travels. I don't know if this affects you but I figure a heads up is good."
Disney world is closed!
Disney world is closed as of Sunday *
"WowEdited: 9:00 pm, March 12, 2020 "
We were deep into planning a quick Spaceship Earth trip this Spring. Doubtful that things could turn around so quickly by April. My guess is they are trying to handle March's cancellations before April starts to call.
"Adding Universal orlando to the list.Im surprised both companies are keeping citywalk and disney springs open for now.Edited: 9:13 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Both areas are mainly restaurants. Since people can still go out in public I can see why they have decided to stay open.
"The trouble is keeping the hotels open means that travel insurance will not pay out. Many do require government advice not to travel but some just if your holiday is not possible. If the hotel remains open and flights running then you are not covered. If they have not changed their stance on this by June when my final £7k payment is due I will admit defeat and accept the £3.5k already spent as lost. I would only wish to travel if I thought it was safe to do so. Yes Mike it might be panic, but this is clearly very easy to contract and we just do not know long term consequences of it. If you became ill would you prefer to be in your own country rather than another? I tend to think you look after your own first is what tends to happen. Look at how Trump has dealt with that cruise ship, only taking his own in and other nationals if they were going straight to a flight out of country. As for the crew well sent them back out to sea to fend for themselves."
"II don't think Disney give a toss about Coronavirus or the potential risk they are putting their staff in, If they did they would close it all.Saying that they will be paid is just to sweeten the pill.The fact that they haven't closed it all means they get to keep customers captive spending even more solely with them should a quarantine/lockdown situation occur and at the same time, they can as Lineandalan just said, refuse refunds.Very shady practice I think."
"""they can as Lineandalan just said, refuse refunds. Very shady practice I think. ""Not true, they are offering full refunds. This is taken from My Disney Experience:I have a future stay at a Disney Resort hotel while the park is closed. What does that mean for my vacation?  Guests who have not checked in for stays between March 16, 2020 through March 31, 2020 may modify or cancel their Disney Resort room reservation or Walt Disney Travel Company package up to their original check-in date. If no action is taken, Disney will automatically process a refund to the original form of payment within seven days of the original check-in date. If you did not book through Disney directly, please contact your travel professional.They are also offering refunds or amendments on tickets as per below:May I get a refund on my ticket?  Unexpired multi-day theme park tickets with unused days, or date-specific theme park tickets with a start date on or before March 31, 2020 will automatically be extended to use any date through December 15, 2020. If you are unable to visit by December 15, 2020 you may apply the value of a wholly unused ticket toward the purchase of a ticket for a future date.Florida Resident Discover Disney Tickets may be used through July 31, 2020.Guests who have purchased tickets for Disney After Hours, Disney Villains After Hours and Disney Early Morning Magic from March 16, 2020 through March 31, 2020 will be automatically refunded."
"Then I obviously stand corrected. Thank you for that information NLG, It will be very reassuring to a lot of people."
"Yep, Disney offering full refunds is a huge relief. We;re supposed to be going at the end of April, so knowing that Disney is taking this stance is very comforting tbh."
Moot point now but at least my reply was attempting to be helpful.
I wonder what this will mean for any future discounting packages.
They decided to close the parks. Coronavirus is ruining everything.
"Three years of saving, planning and preparing....stuck in limbo of hope and bitter disappointment.We are due to go in 42 days, where so much could happen for better or worst. It's tiring, stressful and making me feel unwell waiting for the next update. My husband broke the news to me this morning about Disney etc and it has just crushed me. I know there is so so much worst out there, people have died from this, but I am not going to be ok about it. I don't blame anyone for it, and yes I have insurance to hopefully gain back most of our money to hopefully rebook. But that doesn't help the bitter disappointment of waiting 3 very long years to get here. I was looking forward to immersing myself in a different environment and not having to hear about Covid-19 every 30 seconds I will got sit in the corner on my pity party, i will come out of it, but give me today at least."
"And about the booking, Trip Advisor will refund us? I have a trip for next week, but I won’t take my family out with this possibility to be lockup inside a house, with parks closed and no food in the supermarkets."
"Amy, I feel your pain. Hopefully this will all ease up in a few weeks. I know what it's like to save and plan and save and plan some more for a trip only to have something happen. Hang in there."
"Im still not concerned, roll on April 25th !!!!"
Warren...what happens if they suspend flights...will you just get into a hot air balloon point it towards Orlando and hope for the best Lol
I can only hope that the parks will be open come 1st April. As Amy said there’s worse off out there but not looking forward to having to explain to a 5 year old Disney princess that we are going but you can’t visit the parks. Stuck between rock and a hard place pray the parks open come April or government stops flights and rebook.Amy I’m going to remotely join your pity party.....
schadenfreude From Marion.....now there’s a surprise
"OHH that is so funny and true!""schadenfreude From (any of those mean snobby knob heads).....now there’s a surprise""I am really feeling the pain too, I planned then made alternate plans then planned again.

"Gee, whiz. Pluto!"
"FWIW, our travel agent informed us that both Disney and Universal have fully canceled our resorts & tickets. Our original plans were:WDW: March 13-17Universal Orlando: March 17-20I was afraid that somehow Disney will give hassle saying that their parks were only closed from March 15-onwards but, to their credit, our agent said it wasn't much of an issue. I haven't seen the actual refunds back yet on the credit cards but am feeling pretty good overall about the situation. TBH, I was NOT looking forward to spending time with 50000 people in either of the locations given the virus situation so am happy if it all works out the way it is seeming to.We kept our original flights to Orlando and are now on a spur of the moment vacation in South Beach, Miami followed by Key West. Grabbed a car from MCO with return at MIA. Hoping to salvage our original return leg and have it changed from MCO to MIA but getting nowhere. Our flights were booked through FlightHub on Air Transat and I can't get through to either of them. Air Transat most likely will say talk to the travel agent (FlightHub) who booked them and FlightHub is saying online that our flights cannot be changed for any reason. So rather than deal with all that hassle, I booked a new one-way from MIA-YYZ at dirt cheap prices.All in all, we are making the best lemonade possible. The 27-30 celsius glorious weather helps a lot!Edited: 9:04 am, March 14, 2020 "
"@Manish P.Disney and Universal refuse to tackle the problem of us Europeans who were planning to visit Orlando.The US Administration has banned us from reaching the US until April 13th at least, but both Disney and Universal refuse to refund us.Getting a raincheck for entry to the parks until December 2020 may solve the problem for a US resident who may even drive to Orlando by the end of the year, however it doesn't provide any comfort for Europeans.I have no idea if I can arrange a trip to the USA in year 2021.Disney and Universal's refund policies are outrageous. Why do we need to pay for services we cannot receive due to a decison by the US Administration?USA decided to keep us out of the country to protect the health of its citizens and this is totally acceptable. Why do these iconic US corporations insist on keeping our money?"

"Blu I’m so sorry. This is outrageous, I agree."
"We have canceled our trip for next week. Working today on getting refunds for everything. When I posted here back in Feb that WDW would close because of the virus I expected it would not happen until around June at the earliest. It's been crushing having to forego this vacation, my son was in tears yesterday when we told him.But I am incredibly proud of Disney for stepping up and doing what they think is right. Especially at a time when the state and federal government had so dramatically fumbled the ball by limiting testing so much. Disney could have just gone by the published case numbers, stuck their fingers in their ears and said no, no, all is good, business as usual.This sucks but am trusting it helps everyone.And side note, our trip was kind of complicated. Had lots of flights, activities, lodging booked thru different companies. Pretty much all of them (even airbnb) have modified or relaxed their change and cancellation policies except for vrbo. They have done nothing. We have full cancellation insurance that covers everything on this trip. I'm doing the work getting the refunds to do my part but yeah, was already leery of vrbo because of their fees. Now not likely to use them again ever.Edited: 12:00 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"#340 Thank you Mike, but my travel insurance would cover me only in case of a cancellation for reasons of us getting sick , a strike, missing the plane due to a car accident, and things like that.In this case the airline doesn't cancel our flights. If we were US citizens we could land in the States and get through customs just fine.There is no cover for not being accepted by the US Administration.Maybe after all this ends I need to get a lawyer on that, but I'm afraid legal counselling would probably cost more that the airfare and park tickets.After all, now that the US have expanded their travel ban to include UK and Ireland there will probably be more pressure to Disney and Universal to revise their refunds policy.Edited: 12:48 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"#343Coming back to partially correct my last post,Universal has just refunded my tickets with no hassle whatsoever. Our NBA tickets will also be refunded.It is only Disney who refuse refunds."
The travel ban has been extended to the UK and Ireland.https:/…world-us-canada-51891662
"Good to hear Blu, about Universal refund"
"I guess a lot of people are really concerned now. I think it is a good idea, wonder if Canada will follow suit."
This comment didn't age well...
"We had a trip planned for May 2nd, I just got off the phone with universal. We purchased from visitorlando.com, and ended up having to call them directly. I was told that it would take 72hrs but we would receive a full refund for our 3 day park to park tickets for four people. What a relief. We are happy to pay for the tickets again at a later time when this isn't an issue, but for now, we are happy to be able to get our money back."
"Well, our daughter just found out that she’s been exposed, tests on Monday. She’s a pediatrician so we were all expecting it. I’m high risk (age+asthma) and she wants me to stay in until things improve."
We had planned May 7th.
"Yes, me and wife will re-schedule, is not a good idea to go to Florida and have to find supermarkets how have food and higiene products, the parks are close, the problem is they will not Refund us."

"With great regret we have cancelled our April 19 to 24 trip. Once in a lifetime or not, we feel it’s not the time. Disney may or may not keep the parks closed till then, but it’s too risky to be sick far from home. Let’s hope things settle in a few months. Thanks to all fellow travellers for sharing and supporting."
I am not giving up hope roll on April 15th !!!!!!
25th****
Loving the optimism too Warren... I am due to fly 23rd April. I have until ~3rd then I need to make the call (or have it decided for me by Disney) due to other hotel/parking reservations etc. Time will tell...
"I am still planning until i get that email saying its cancelled, or the travel ban gets extended, until then as far as i am concerned i am still going"
US CDC recommendation: no groups over 50 for 8 weeks throughout the country.
I hope this thing doesn't hurt a lot us. I worry that travel insurance will make travel out of reach. I think if we mouse lovers can go back and everything is ok it will truly be the happiest place.

"My flight to Tampa just left. Would have been 3 days in Tampa/Busch gardens, week in Orlando, then 5 days at Indian Shores beach.Instead I’m home with my kids. Have received news that a conference that I worked outside of, I went inside a few times to use the bathroom, all 15000 attendees are being told by the health authority to home quarantine for 14 days because an attendee has been confirmed to have infected several people there. So me and the other officers that were there are trying to figure out if we need to quarantine as well. Was 11 days ago now so might be pointless.Edited: 5:02 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Good luck Yarbogash. Best wishes to you.
"octoberitaly2, thanks, means a lot.Learned it was a dental conference. Didn’t even know that when I was there. Pretty much every dentist in our province attended and they are all being advised to do the quarantine. Not the best time to get a toothache in British Columbia."
"Yarbogash a lot of talk about dentists and risk for their exposure and then can spread to patients. I cancelled my dental appointment yesterday and they seemed grateful. Lots of questions on the news. The CDC guidelines currently recommend mask and gloves and goggles ( and I think gown? ) for any healthcare provider examining the mouth or respiratory tract. So yeah I can guess a dental conference would easily have some asymptomatic and infected. Google CDC coronavirus infection control. But hey you are 11 days in out of 14!But sounds like most of your dentists are now in quarantine.Edited: 6:09 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Who could have ever envisioned the dramatic twists and turn since the OP. I must admit I felt cynicism at first but now I am scared. Here in Scotland our schools closed today and it looks like we might go into a total lockdown. Our planned holiday in July to Orlando just two days after our sons wedding looks like it won’t happen. However, I’m trying to be optimistic and keep telling myself it’s only postponed until 2021. IMHO Orlando is the greatest place in the world to holiday and I can’t wait to get back. I must admit we are all on information overload here with 24/7 news and social media. We are glued to our phones and sometimes I just pop on here to read a tipping or a buffet thread to cheer me up. So you colonial cousins of ours keep posting and keep us entertained.Edited: 5:59 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Fluffy us colonial cousins are having restaurants take out only, schoools closed, some cities on not quite lockdown but necessary activities only. But I can recommend some YouTube park videos you may like!"
"I am no longer concerned, I am beyond that.I just want a Dole Whip and a ride on Splash Mountain, that:s all....Things are sad here and it is still cold, I am sure if I had some nice palms trees and cute little lizards to watch everything would feel easier to take.I will see you again Mickey."

"#374,Advertising is not allowed on TA."
"Wow, how things have changed since then. Was there a canary in the coal mine? I miss those little birds in the tubes at Thunder Mountain."
"Mojomo, grats on the birth! Glad your people are safe, wherever they are."
"Mojomo, thanks for sharing happy news! A cousin for your grandson."
Yesterday marked fourteen day since our Orlando trip. Not sure if we’d have gone if I’d known then what I know now but I have to admit to sometimes hearing only what I want to hear when it comes to Disney. We were there at the same time as the poor man who died so I was a little concerned. Feels a tad inappropriate but I kinda feel like celebrating dodging that bullet.
smlaLouisianaI am glad you got to go! And I hope that you continue to stay well.
I doubt flights will be operating in August
Flights within the USA haven’t stopped.
"Flights haven’t stopped in the UK..Out on a cycle this morning a B747 flew over the bay.. Clear cloudless skies, showing up beautifully.."
"80% of flights have stopped in UK according to what I read yesterday. The remaining 20% are made up of cargo and internal flights for essential travel. Virgin did have three flights still going to NY, LA and Hong Kong but they have now stopped also. There are also one or two coming in from India and the Far East but that is all.As far as U.K. passengers are concerned it might as well be all flights stopped as you cannot get out of the country."
"Yes there are still flights in the US, but way down. I live very close to JFK, some days can be constant plane after plane. Now if you hear 2 or 3 a day it's a lot."
I can absolutely confirm plenty of flights leaving Heathrow. Normally we have maybe 1 or 2 an hour go over our house (we don’t live over the traditional main flight path) bit now for many daytime hours it’s sometimes nearer 10. They seem to be changing course earlier as nothing in their way.
"lineandalan, the flights you are seeing are probably cargo planes as there are a lot of them. I think they must have changed the flight paths as we usually get planes heading to Heathrow going overhead all the time but I have not seen or heard one for about a month."
Agreed Marykin. Some of them have no airline markings at all! They all seem to be doing quick banking.
just checked B.A. schedule and according to that flights to resume to orlando from the 22nd of may also saying this on flyertalk.
They might say that but if Trump does not lift ban on UK visitors there is little point getting on a plane
