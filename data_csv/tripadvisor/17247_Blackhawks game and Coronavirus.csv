"Hello, I plan on going to the Blackhawks game this Wednesday(March 11th). I am from the southern part of the state. How concerned should I be with going to the U.C? I plan on driving all the way to the stadium. Should I think about cancelling the trip because of the coronavirus, or do you all think it will be safe? Thanks"
"I’d go. I don’t take any disease as a joke, but I’d just follow the same lifestyle precautions that I normally do."
No one can tell you if it's safe. I'd still be going.
I wouldn't go. Why risk it until they have a handle on this thing. I would choose to do something else fun that didn't include a stadium.
"This is a personal decision based on your age, general health and risk tolerance. Also, I imagine, whether you have a job with health benefits. Officials are recommending that those over 60 or with chronic health conditions avoid ""mass gatherings""."
"Welcome to TA! This seems to be a fast moving story. In the past week I have been to 4 large events all involving theatre plus saw opening night of the Pixar movie. I honestly didn’t think twice about it. Now just a few days later I am rethinking all my movements. Is it worth it? Don’t think I will be going to any large events if I can help it for a while, but that is me."
"I was against the panic three weeks ago. Now I'm not putting myself in the midst of a large crowd. I've begun freezing meals and prepping for 14 days of cabin fever. However, all the rest of the 3 million Chicagolanders will have to self quarantine at the same time. That's not going to happen. We all need to be aware of the consequences of gathering in large crowds.Edited: 12:49 am, March 11, 2020 "
I see no reason to gather in a large crowd at this point. While some say it is panic many scientists say that staying ahead of this virus will shorten its lifespan. I am all for that.Hockey will be there when Covid19 is gone.B.

"NBA just announced the cancellation of the season. Perhaps the NHL will follow suit. You may have seen the last game of the season. Hopefully you’ll not suffer any after effects.Why don’t people pay attention?Edited: 10:27 pm, March 11, 2020 "
