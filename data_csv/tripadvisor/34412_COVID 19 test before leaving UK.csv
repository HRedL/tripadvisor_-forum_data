We have booked for Barbados for middle of August and still trying to find out if they will accept us having a negative NHS test within 72 hours of course on arrival at the airport?
Julie P....there are already a number of topics on this matter ...full of detail and information As of now you need a negative test ..... however there is detail that seems to be changing or clarifiedBy August it could be completely different
Thanks. I had seen the discussions on it on previous posts but it didn’t make clear if NHS test was acceptable or you have to pay for a private one. I am hoping by the time we travel it will have changed but wanting to prepare
julie p we are booked at end of Aug would be really interested to hear how you have got on with both the test and the flight if you have opportunity - good luck and safe travels
Julie ....indeed some things are still unclearIn one of the previous protocols it stipulated that a test should be from approved source / laboratory ...this was then clarified as ISO 15189 for the UK Not sure about the NHS test but guess they would use approved laboratories ....otherwise I suppose you have to ask !!!Even then ... not sure as yet whether the staff at GA are actually checking this aspect of the proof of test If it were me ...I would wait a couple of weeks and then have another look
"Prediction for Barbados by end of August, they will be back to a full lockdown again, as the number of US visitors bringing the virus will be huge.Any country who allows US tourists in, deserves what they get."
"NHS test is acceptable but I advise that you are careful what you say to get one! - In the UK you can only have a free test if you have symptoms...and if you say you have symptoms to get a free test, you could potentially invalidate your holiday insurance unless you tell your insurance company that you have told the NHS you have symptoms."
"Before you think of travel, as well, find out from a clinic if you are able to get a test before leaving that is guaranteed to come through. As I have said before, people on the Air Canada flight had their tests done but there is just not enough time for a test to come through (most clinics in the UK do not operate Sat and Sun - so 72 hours is not enough for a traveller on a Mon or Tues flight for example). That means you will almost certainly have paid for a test, not have the results and then have to have it done here."
"#15 The key to the USA situation is that that country has done record testing (more than double the amount of testing that Canada has done for example) so it's difficult to tell in truth what the situation is. Anti-Americans post a lot about this (not saying you are #15) but it is not really scientific or a reflection of stats. On a planeload of 150, you are just as likely to get positive tests from UK, Canada etc as USA. Look at the WHO stats and figs."
Thanks I will definitely wait till closer to the time and keep investigating. In the meantime if you hear of any updates would love to hear
Hi. Yes I will update if we manage to travel
"Joe, easy comparison is to convert number of positive cases as a percentage of tested. That will show the prevalence of cases. Trump is cutting funding for testing so the numbers drop but that is only the number that you know of not the true number of infected cases. If Ontario has 115/day positive cases out if 14 million (very few hospitalized) and Florida has 15300/day out of 21 million (hospitals full, ICUs full) where do you think your chance of infection is higher?"
"This explains positivity rate and what some states are reporting. The WHO suggests a rate of 5% ir less, FL, AZ and MS are well above that. Ontario's is 0.7%https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20200715/…"
"Hi Joe, thank you for your on the ground responses to numerous questions. I think the invalidation of your insurance if you have the NHS test is wrong, however I’m interested that you say this is accepted by the authorities. The NHS test is validated as negative by means of an email from the UK government so no actual certificate as such? Will this be accepted as proof of a negative test in your opinion."
"If you fib to get a NHS certificate and it comes back negative, why should it affect your insurance ? It’s negative , so that proves ( hopefully ) you don’t have Covid 19 ?"
"It is generally taken that if you lie in order to obtain something fraudulently in connection with the matter of your insurance, it is invalid. Similarly, it surely must be obvious that if, say, you claim on a Friday to have Covid19 symptoms (to obtain a test) and you do not inform your insurer that you have made this claim to the authorities just hours before leaving the UK, then not only are you committing a criminal offence (which you are) but you are not disclosing all relevant factors to your insurer: so if you go on to catch the virus on the plane or while travelling, then your insurance will be invalid.I have checked this with insurers on behalf of some of the people whose travel I deal with. The key to this is: will you get a free test by telling the NHS the real reason? ""We're a family of 4 and we fly to Barbados on holiday and need a test result in the next 48 hours please"". We know the answer is no, we know therefore that it is being done to defraud and is a criminal offence. In the present febrile times when people are being vilified for sitting on beaches in the Uk or going into pubs etc, my advice is like they used to say after dangerous stunts on tv: ""don't try this one at home"""
"Actually I would be interested to see what the NHS communication/certificate looks like. I was under the impression that there WAS something on it that said it had been done according to the UK process (the one referred to by the Barbados Government in its protocols). Interesting though and I will find out. Some people will take the risk and get such a test so it's worth finding out whether it is actually worthwhile!. I have to say I assume it is (but again, do not know for a fact)."
"Joe, the email confirmation I have seen is very basic, more or less as followsNHSDear xxxxxxxxYour recent COVID-19 test has been processed and has come back NEGATIVE etc etc There is also a gov.uk email confirmation of your actual appointment date and time so maybe these combined would be acceptable (if of course this is the route chosen)No doubt things will become much clearer after this weekend once the first BA flight arrives"
"You are correct Westie but... if you do get covid while in Barbados and you need care would your insurance cover you if you committed fraud? I don't know about the UK but in Canada the insurance has the right to speak with your doctor and to see your medical files. Not having had a covid test I don't know (Canby would) if they ask for your doctor, health card number, clinic etc. and if they (Public Health Lab) automatically send their reports to your doctor or clinic. I would think so just so the responsibility of that report becomes someone else's responsibility and not theirs.Would it not be better for the UK gov't to just offer the testing free?"
"I’m not sure why insurance is so relevant anyway. If you have the NHS test done and you’re negative, you travel. If the result comes back positive you don’t travel? Am I missing something?"
"NC if you get a negative test because you don’t have Covid , and then later on are unlucky enough to catch Covid then how have you defrauded anyone ?  Are you not allowed to catch it after a negative test ? That would be great if it was true but of course it isn’t ."
"On testing, the US has tested roughly 50% more per million that Canada has, and one can easily select parts of the country to prove different theses about likely infection rates. Alas, these are unscientific as a general rule in dealing with travel. In general (and taken the overall stats) then if flights come in from Canada and the US averaging say 150 people a time, at the levels which we are expecting over the next two months, then there will 'probably' be Covid cases on flights from both countries. No scientist will give you likely numbers because the base figures are too low - eg if we are using Florida as our example, then 1.4% of Florida's population has tested positive in four months, Canada's generally is a fifth to a quarter of that. But with less testing. Statistically it IS different and very much so, much lower even allowing for the lower testing - but those stats (and however much we like to preen ourselves over them) are not of much use when planes of 150 people are flying in. They do not make Canada immune from exporting people with Covid, alas. Just a very tiny bit less likely in real terms. Which is a start! But one person infected on the plane means, well, they could all be infected (whatever their little certificates say!). Whether they are from Mississauga or Manhattan"
"22 Westiegal - OK, say you tell them you have symptoms of Covid to get the test and do not report it to your insurer. The test is a snapshot in time and the virus can take time to develop. Not just when you have the symptoms. On the US flight a week or so ago, people who got in had been tested and almost all were fine. And then a week later 5 were re-tested and had the virus. So you lie to get a test, you are negative but do not tell your insurer you are saying to the state that you have detected symptoms of the virus. You then develop the symptoms after the results of the test and while you are here. You have invalidated your insurance because you have failed to tell your insurer of something that might affect your insurance. Telling your insurer ""Well you know, I mean, of course I didn't have symptoms, everyone lies on forms like this"" tends not to go down too well..."
"As they say, people can do what they like, but I am just telling you what two insurers have told me when I asked. Oh and Northern Canuck - spot on. Of course they should give the test to all in the UK, and specially in fact to people travelling - it is after all a public service to stop the spread of this virus if someone is legally moving about. I have already written to the UK department of health and social care to explain why this should happen and asked other colleagues to do the same. There is a real logic to it and it would actually reduce costs generally.Edited: 2:27 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"OK Joe but what if you told your Insurance Company what you had done and explained it was the only way you could get a test . ? And , it was Negative ."
"I found the figures for comparison of positivity rates between Canada and some US states.MS 15%, FL 18.7% AZ 24.7% all of Canada 0.74%. WHO recommends 5% or less. 15 of 50 states are less than 5%.I can't find the rate for the UK, just the incidence rate . Perhaps they don't report it."
I’ve looked into insurance in respect of COVID-19 and I’m not holding my breath it would be much use anyway. Mia has already stated that you will be looked after should you fall ill. I will only travel if confirmed negative before the plane takes off.
"Westie of course but you have already told the NHS that you have symptoms in order to get the test done in the first place. If they see those symptoms listed within 14 days of you becoming sick they will use that to get out of paying. I should think telling the insurance you have lied to get the test done would not go over well with them.Gary, Mia said *urgent/emergency* care will be free which is very admirable! Does that mean hospital but not ICU care and standard ward care is covered? I doubt it. Our insurance also covers trip cancellation and interrption due to covid. Mia is not offering to cover those losses."
"NC, think you’re wrong regards hospital care in relation to COVID. Pretty sure her words were along the lines of we would look after anyone that needed care regardless. As for cancellation costs / interruption Why would I be seeking them?"
Incidence rateUSA 0.95% of populationCanada 0.29% of populationPositivity result for US 9%https:/…testing-in-us.htmlFor Canada 3.1%https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/e…
"I remember her saying urgent care to keep you alive, that is who we are. I don't have access to the vid now so I can not confirm.You would need cancellation in case you or your travel partner gets covid just before flying. Right now there is the 72 hour testing so if pos you can't go. If that testing is dropped in the future then just getting sick before your flight should stop you from flying. Interruption is just part of it."
"Correction for #27found the figures for comparison of positivity rates between Canada and some US states.MS 15%, FL 18.7% AZ 24.7% all of Canada 3.1% the US approx. 9% WHO recommends 5% or less. 15 of 50 states are less than 5%.I can't find the rate for the UK, just the incidence rate . Perhaps they don't report it."
JoeVRe #17 .....again you are working to scenarios or making assumptions that are simple not valid Let's be clear .... you do not have to tell your insurer about something you do not have !!!If they ask you and you lie then it may invalidate a claim but I very much doubt it would result in criminal proceedingsEqually you do not have to tell them about ALL tests that you have ....unless the results are relevant to a change I have recent experience of discussing medical conditions and have confirmed the above with a GP and two insurance brokers
...JoeV ....You might also want to take a detailed look at the Fraud Act 2006 for a legal definition of 'fraud by misreprentation 'The only party interested in a test that is negative is the Barbados Government ....and maybe the NHS for data analysis ...not your insurance company
"Insurance. Irrespective of whether it's a new or old policy, you are advised to pro-actively declare anything that might affect any potential claim. The question of making a fraudulent statement about symptoms to obtain a free test is entirely separate to your insurance. The issue with insurance is if you fail to declare that you have stated to the NHS you have symptons of Covid19. If you claim to have symptoms and get tested as a result, then you have to declare that to your insurers if you want your insurance to be valid and for it not to potentially be invalidated. You are saying you believe that you potentially have a virus that you could spread to others on a plane in a day or two's time and for which you should absolutely not be travelling. Whether you are covid free at that precise moment is irrelevant to your insurers. We have just had 5 cases from re-testing a week later. Insurers will be concerned if you later have to make a covid-related claim. I act for a number of clients and have spoken to insurance companies in the UK and they all say exactly the same thing. Failure to declare something that could have an affect on your insurance potentially invalidates it. They might take no notice, they might charge you a tenner more. Now or next month. Who knows. They might not ask a thing.To avoid to much to and fro on this, do not listen to us arguing one way or another. We have had our say and have different experiences and thoughts. If you feel that there is no need to worry about declaring what you have done, then surely you should call your insurers, tell them ""we are having/have had an NHS Covid19 test"", leave it at that and see what they say!? Simple really. But do bear in mind that having a test for free and under false pretences is fraud - it's not just a little white lie as there is no such thing in law. ANd tell us here what they said when you called. I assure you it is important in any event to understand the implications.Edited: 7:47 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"#37 At the end of para 1 I should have added: ""Provided you tell your insurer what you are doing or have done"""
"JoeV ..... you keep saying it is fraud ...I ask again what is your basis for saying this . It is wrong to leave people thinking they are committing fraud ...which you have done more than once on this ForumIt is not a matter of opinion In this situation the key element of the Fraud Act 2006, as it was in the various acts that it replaced, is there any ""gain or loss"" of money ...used to be called ""obtaining pecuniary advantage""There is also the issue of 'legal duty ' to declareTake a look at Sections 2(1) and Section 5 FYI ... I have checked this with a QC friend and he says my interpretation is correct There is no financial gain or loss from the results of a Covid test ...so no fraud So ... I took up your suggestion and spoke to my insurer ...and I scoured the 25 pages of the policy documentsFraud is specifically dealt with in the policy BUT is is all about knowingly making a claim to be false or exaggerated or make a statement / submitting documents in support of of claimSo ...no claim no fraud and anyhow a negative Covid test is not likely to the basis of a claim I also called the insurers ...as I have ben told a number of times ... the is no need to record every test ... only those that change a given condition. The CS lady that took my call ...said ""that would be ridiculous - we would gave no time to deal with claims or start new policies ""She said that a negative Covid test is of no consequence as it changes nothing - so does not need reportingAs I have said a number of times ...if you are asked a specific question - you must answer it honestly.... and finally who is going to know whether you have a temperature or not ????Edited: 5:30 am, July 16, 2020 "
Maybe not fraud but gain by means of false pretences.Whichever way you look at it you told a lie.
gary b ...Re: #19 did you also get an Email ??? ...I did both times ..also from the NHS How long did your reply take ???Both mine were next day .... around 20 :00 approx 28 hours after the test
"UK Gov sets out testing under 4 pillars (pillars 1 + 2 apply in this instance) Definition of testing pillarpillar 1: swab (antigen) testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need and health and care workerspillar 2: swab (antigen) testing for the wider populationTesting capacityOverall lab capacity is important to ensure the programme is able to meet potential demand and deliver large numbers of tests.Pillar 1 Lab capacity 79,526Pillar 2 Lab capacity 132,000All tests in pillar 1 are counted when they are processed by a lab. Tests in pillar 2 are administered in 2 different ways:counted when they are sent outcounted when they are processed by a labNot all tests sent out will be returned to the labs.Daily Pillar 1 tests processed 53,820 Pillar 2 tests processed 50,357 Pillar 2 tests sent out 68,700 This information is accurate as of 12th JulyAs you can see there is more than enough spare capacity for NHS testing.You are not 'stealing a test' from those with a greater need.In fact the government actively encourage people to get a test without just saying it outright.Apologies for the long winded explanation but i feel some have lost their way on this"
"mdp...i haven't had the test yet but a relative has. Booked online, drive in appointment next day, email reply saying negative received in just over 24 hours. Very impressive service"
"gary b ... so just the same as me except my appointment was same day - within 2 hoursThe only unimpressive bit was that the fact that this massive Army staffed facility ( at LHR) was deserted on both occasions ...I simply did not believe what I saw""""""You are not 'stealing a test' from those with a greater need.In fact the government actively encourage people to get a test without just saying it outright.""""""...totally agree - especially the second point ..we simply are wasting the testing capacity that we have alreadyIn his press conference today Boris said """"An expansion in testing capacity to a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October would help identify positive coronavirus cases among people with symptoms of seasonal illnesses""""Surely IF this is possible it is time to follow the WHO advice and Test Test Test ...whether you have symptoms or not. By the autumn arrives it would appear that almost any symptoms will qualify for a test !!!"
At 500K tests per day we could test the whole population once in 132 day +/-Obviously many will need testing more than once but if we started with those over 35 it would be a start... or maybe the 18 > 30 group - so they could socialise with more confidence !!!
"Mdp, totally agree with every word. I would add that if the spare testing capacity isn't taken up there is a danger (albeit very slight) that they will start actually reducing test capacity."
I am also flying on the BA flight on 15th August - I am hoping now that the test for me and my family should be available on the NHS - given the huge ramp up - so far no community testing announced though. I am encouraged by the turn around times other have confirmed.
"joanlems ...here you go again ... more inaccuracies"""""" Maybe not fraud but gain by means of false pretences""""""...gain by false pretences IS fraud ...have a look at the 2006 Act ...and please explain (which I know you will not) ...what 'gain' there is in a Covid test??? .... other than the positive or negative result """"""Whichever way you look at it you told a lie""""""Please take the time to read my words on this particular matter ...

No apology mdp you stated you told a white lie in order to obtain a test.A lie is a lie.
I do not think so ...I was indeed suggesting that a 'white lie' ( yes a lie maybe) was a way of getting a free NHS testWhy would I state that I had told a lie when it was not necessary for me to do so .... please supply the topic in which you claim I said that
GreetingsFor good orders sake you can get a Covid in the U.K. thru the NHS without symptoms We have been taking on new employees at work and it’s part of her process that they get a test to confirm they are negative before they start workYou don’t need to tell any lies
"@ mdp,.We cant get these on the NHS""""""This is not strictly true ...all that is required is a small white lie .... lack of taste or smell is good enough from the list of symptoms that they give you"
"As I have said before elsewhere, you potentially invalidate your insurance if you tell a lie about your health and do not disclose it fully. Whether the policy is existing or new, you are obliged to disclose any information you thing may be relevant. If, to get a test, you have said you have symptoms of Covid, then if you think you have done nothing wrong, you have to tell the insurer. That is what I was told on behalf of my clients. If you think it's 'just a little white lie', thensurely there's no problem in telling your insurer that you lied, you do actually not think you had symptoms, you just lied to get a test for free and therefore do no think you might infect the whole plane? As I was reminded, insurance is based upon trust.It's now up for you guys to decide whether you are happy lying and hiding what you have done from your insurers. Some feel happy doing that, some do not. And above all, if you are worried about it, why not ask your insurance company if you need to declare it?If you do not do this and while away develop symptoms, failure to declare that you told the state you had symtpoms before you leftwould be a criminal offence. And sorry, but obtaining a test by lying is a fraudulent act.Edited: 6:54 am, July 18, 2020 "
"JoeV I totally agree, it is as always up to the individual as to whether they declare the test and method to their insurer ... probably without any recourse..BUT as I have said elsewhere ...I have been told by 2 broker friends and my insurers you do not have to tell them about a negative test"""""" And sorry, but obtaining a test by lying is a fraudulent act""""""... sorry ...no it is not ... if you are so convinced ...direct me to the sections of the Act that covers it. Lying is only fraud when there is gain ie financial benefit If you are going to make these statements ... provide the evidence"
DaveC ...interesting ... news to me ... but then I no longer hire staff. Does not cover everyone How do you book it ???
joanlems ...Apology not required ... I know you are wrongThe words you have quoted in #52 are a suggestion (as I said ) as to what could be done ... NOT what I actually did ...which was tick the high temperature box ..which was true and correct The more testing we do the more will understand this virus ... we now have surplus capacity not being used .... it is just such a shame we are getting around to it so late in the day
We are also travelling and considering NHS or private testing. A friend had a test recently and showed me her result email. The issue is that the NHS result email only says you are negative with your name and DOB. It has no test date or test type so will this even be accepted?
"@mdp I accept you were only advising people how to lie to obtain a test from the NHS.Edited: 8:03 am, July 18, 2020 "
"As I have said, I have been told by two insurers and my own agent now that ""if you are trying to get a Covid19 test when the rules say you can only obtain one free if you declare you have symptoms, then to declare symptoms falsely and knowing that you are doing so just to avoid paying 200 pounds to a private clinic is a fradulent act"". It is clearly so. You are defrauding the state. There are many crimes in which you can act to obtain something by deception and in a fraudulent manner, not all prosecuted in the same way.If there was enough capacity to test the entire country, the government would ask everyone to do so - the government has specifically said that it will NOT provide mass testing to anyone who wants it whenever. As I have said before, it is a lie, and all who say that they might do it admit that they would be lying. But much more importantly in many ways is the lie's impact on insurance. If it is not a problem, they surely you should declare to your insurer that you had a free test, you declared to the state that you lied and said you had symptoms when you did not, ""hope that's OK""? Otherwise not to do so, means you know you are doing wrong.As I have further said, and I was specifically told this: ""if you claim you had Covid symptoms, 3 days before you flew (to get a free test), failed to declare this to your insurer, then ended up with the virus, you potentially invalidate your insurance"" Surely anyone realises that to claim you had symptoms of Covid on Tuesday, then show symptoms a week or so later when re-tested or finding yourselves in hospital, then you have to lie again to your insurer if asked about your statement made about having symptoms? And hope you get away with it? What will you do if they say ""you went to the NHS to get a test. This means you said you had symptoms...what did you say and why?"""
"#57 Because of the first incoming flights, I suspect we might find out more later today or tomorrow if the NHS test has been accepted. I have an instinct it will be, but do not know. My one client on the flight does not actually have a test result with her (it did not come through - she may have had it in transit)"
Hi ! Can you confirm that NHS coved tests are acceptable for entry into Barbados. I can’t find this information anyway. Thanks!
justine....I have not seen it written down anywhere that the NHS tests are processed in an ISO 15189 rated laboratory but would be extremely surprised to find out that they are notWe may soon get reports on this forum or FB following the arrival of the first BA flight as to whether the NHS test is acceptableI believe it more likely that a 'private' test is processed in a lab that is not ISO rated but again I think the chances of that are slimAt least with a private test you can ask in advance of parting with your money
All NHS COVID tests are carried out by UKAS approved laboratories. This is 100% fact.The only grey area is that your proof of a negative NHS test is currently an email confirmation not a ‘certificate’ as such and therefore will Barbados immigration accept this. If they have been briefed correctly there should be no problem.
"MDP - sorry for the delay it’s been busy weekend, you can get a test two different ways - independently thru the website or thru an employer’s approved reference number, I do appreciate the grey area in all of thisThe poster rattling on about fraud and criminal acts is way way over the top , the intent here is to simplyget tested in time - maybe folks from other countries do not appreciate that we have free health care here in the U.K.?Stay safe"
"Hi, I can confirm that NHS will be accepted. I arrived yesterday on BA flight. However I would strongly advise that you bring every bit of paperwork you have connected to your test, including appointment card as the NHS results have no indication of time/date when test was taken. I also contacted my GP prior to leaving who was also able to email me a full copy of COVID results which listed time/date sample was tested in lab, lab code and results. Please be warned though getting this from GP is hit and miss. My GP had all this info, but my partners GP didn’t as they’d not been forwarded over by pathology lab"
"Sinclair Please could you tell us what the travel experience was like yesterday, departure, flight and arrival arrangements. Could you also confirm what the 7 day monitoring arrangements entail are you confined to your accommodation? I like many others on here we are very keen to here from someone who has just arrived."
That is good news as we are due to go mid August but not going If have to stay in room for 7 days. Can you please confirm if this is the case please?
Sinclair Can I kindly ask if your partner was still ok not having the extra NHS info please?If we do the postal test we won’t have that info available :(
DaniI have had the postal test and results were sent via email. Results have your name and date of birth but do not give a date when test was carried out. I was hoping that date and time received email would suffice?
"Before you ask Mdp... ""UKAS provides ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation to organisations performing various types of testing and calibration."" LolDave we have ""free"" health care in Canada as well but we don't have to lie to be tested. Covid tests are free here. Our gov't wants as many people tested as possible to try to undrstand what is really going on.Wouldn't the intent be to get tested and not have to pay? Private testing is availabke for a fee in the UK.Edited: 6:48 am, July 19, 2020 "
We are hoping the same ;-)Would be good to hear from someone who has used one at the airport. I will also call them tomorrow i think to ask the question.
"Hi Chris, I departed from Gatwick yesterday morning. Very swift check in etc.....due to lack of travelers airport was like a ghost town. Flight experience......to be honest wasn’t that great due to the fact of plenty of passengers NOT adhering to wearing face masks during flight, which really pxxxed me off. Had one guy and a separate lady(they was not traveling together might I add constantly walking up and down the plane ailed with their toddler even though protocols clearly state to remain in your seat unless to use the toilet. Now I can understand toddlers can get restless on flights, being a father of two and having travelled multiple times with them, but neither of them wore mask throughout the whole duration even though air stewards were handing them out for free. With some traveling without a COVID test I just found that a blatant disregard for the passengers on the plane and most importantly the citizens of Barbados. So if either of you or any one on the flight whom couldn’t be bothered to wear their mask think about the consequences your selfish, lack of regard for others could cause. Arrival- upon disembarking the plane all passengers are then ferried to terminal where you’ll be directed Left- if you’ve got PCR results. Right - if no PCR test results, meaning you’ll be tested at the airport.We then proceeded to have our results checked, please see my previous post regarding NHS results. Once your results check out you’ll then proceed to have your passport and ED form checked. Due to problems with the system I couldn’t complete ED form 24hrs prior to departing so was advised to do this upon arrival, kiosk are aplenty to do this and as everyone on the flight had their ED form the queue for this to be checked was long, whereas no one using kiosk so whole process for us took 10mins max whilst those with had a wait of about 30mins. 7 day monitoring - you’ll then need to fill out a form for the health ministry stating your detail, address for where you’ll be staying and contact telephone number. In return you’ll be given thermometers and a another form which you’ll need to record your temperature on every day. This is VERY important as you’ll be contacted everyday for 7 day and require to supply them with this information. You will NOT be required to quarantine at all providing you adhere to this which is more than reasonable. Let’s just hope those with a sheer lack of regards on flights don’t screw this up. Anything else you’d like to know please ask......oh and they are giving out welcome packs upon exiting the airport which include 4 small bottles of rum and nut cake which I thought was a very nice touch."
"Hi Dani, yes my partner was ok getting through, but like I said I’m my previous post make sure you produce everything you have relating to your test, appoint confirmation email, test appointment card, test results. Print them off also as they also like to see a hard copy along with emails etc.....postal PCR tests will not be accepted so I advise getting a NHS test at walk in/drive through. These can now be booked online without telling a white lie. We stated no symptoms prior to booking and got a test no problem"
Thanks Sinclair :)So what was the timing with your test please? Were you able to get the results in time to upload them.Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my many questions!
Hi this is great news about not quarantining for 7 days. Can cope with doing thermometer test each day. This means we don’t need to cancel our holiday x
"Thank you Sinclair for your detailed report. Not only are you helping future British travellers but Canadian ones as well. You have also put to rest some of this hyped up misinformation that is out there. To record and report your temperature etc. For 7 days does not seem much of a hardship to me. If the ministry of health could get the location form attached to the ED form online wouldn't that speed up the entire process in the airport?I agree, those not wearing a mask or face shield are selfish and inconsiderate. Why did the cabin crew not enforce the airline's rules?"
"Sinclair, thank you for taking the time to post. Have a great holiday"
Thank you SinclairP you've set a lot. of peoples minds at rest including mine ! - have a great trip and stay safe
"Hi Dani, we had our test Wednesday 11:30am this week, results sent back to us the following day. Allow an extra day for your GP to receive your results. Our flight was 11:20am Saturday."
"NC I am unsure why the flight attendant didn’t enforce this I guess they were overwhelmed with the whole new experience of air travel, in fairness the captain did make multiple announcements throughout the flight reminding passengers of protocols, but as we are currently in a global pandemic and things have been put in place to protect not just the people on the plane, but the Barbados citizens on a whole I just can’t seem to get my head around why educated adults can’t follow the very, very simple rules. I was really tempted to have a go at these travelers, but my partner feared it causing a scene. The ramifications for the Bajan people are HUGE so for anyone traveling soon please don’t be that inconsiderate tourist. They’ve welcomed us back to their beautiful island so people please don’t screw it up."
Hi SinclairGlad you got there ok. Have you a link to where it says that I can book an NHS test without having to lie? Both the NHS (https:/…) and Gov (https:/…who-can-be-tested) websites seem to be still saying that I can only book a test if I have symptoms or am an essential worker?Thanks
"That's TERRIBLE that passengers were allowed, if I read correctly, that they were allowed to roam the plane without a mask. I would be adressing this issue immediately with the airline. By phone or email. If by chance these people test positive and it effects others on the plane they are negligent and I would want them to be responsible for any expenses I should incur due to them not adressing the passengers behavior. Inexcusable they allowed that to happen. To those who cant occupy a child in their seat maybe it's not time to travel with them. I probably would not have been able to keep myself from addressing this with them or addressing my concern with an attendant. It's my understanding that it's very rare that people are exempt from wearing masks. If that is the case they definitely must be required to stay put in one place. Use a scarf or bandana. Or not be allowed to fly.The temperature monitoring for 7 days is appropriate and very reasonable.Edited: 8:33 am, July 19, 2020 "
"Hi Sinclair - thanks for taking the time, first thing on your holiday - you have really given so much more information, which is just not available anywhere else. We travel on 15th August, and were getting concerned about the ambiguity and misinformation being put out. I am still not clear on where to book the test stating no symptoms? Looks like we will be in Barbados for sure now though. Have a great holiday."
"Sinclair ... Thanks for some very useful information On the subject of test results...""""""I also contacted my GP prior to leaving who was also able to email me a full copy of COVID results which listed time/date sample was tested in lab, lab code and results. Please be warned though getting this from GP is hit and miss. My GP had all this info, but my partners GP didn’t as they’d not been forwarded over by pathology lab""""""This is most interesting ...as, when asked, my GP said that he did not have access to the NHS test results I will ask again !!!"
"Ah ok so they accepted it 72 hours from departure and not arrival. That’s where we were confused!Your replies are so helpful, I hope you are enjoying beautiful Barbados!"
"Sinclair....""""""so I advise getting a NHS test at walk in/drive through. These can now be booked online without telling a white lie. We stated no symptoms prior to booking and got a test no problem""""""Basically the same question as in #83 from Steve W and in #85.... did you simply not tick any of the listed symptoms and then proceed ???...or is there another way ???Edited: 9:27 am, July 19, 2020 "
Thank you Sinclair - really great of you to take the time to feedback so quickly. Disheartened to hear some people didn’t wear face masks & it wasn’t enforced by staff. Hopefully these issues will be ironed out & Barbados stays safe. Were people able to space out on the plane? I am assuming it wasn’t full...
"Thank you so much for putting some questionable information to bed Sinclair. Tomorrow I shall be reporting the woman on the Covid help line at the Ministry of Health for giving out total misinformation and causing people to think of cancelling their holidays.  I am horrified to hear that some idiots on the plane were not wearing masks, and more horrified to hear that nothing was done about it. --------------Uktrip , asthma is not an excuse, I have asthma but I still wear a mask."
Those with supposed breathing issues can wear a face shield instead. They do not impede breathing.Yes Westie I agree with you. That help line person should be reported and who ever told her to give out that information.Hard to believe the FAs did not enforce company policy especially since the pilots were making announcements. Could one of them have not come back and talked to the offenders? They would have if somone was smoking in the restroom.
Well that's cheered me up...looks like our holiday in November will be fine as long as things don't worsen either in Barbados or UK before then. Off for a G&T in the garden to celebrate.
"Sinclair,Thanks so much for this info. Did you hear anything about those that didn’t have test results come back in time? Or that had them on their phones but not hard copy? How long was the wait for the test in the airport? And did they tell you that you had to stay at your destination and not leave for 7 days? Could you take a walk for instance, observing 6 feet protocols?"
Nichole----------------I'm afraid Americans will be treated very differently from these BA Passengers at the moment . Blame your man in charge.
"Nicole, the States are in the high risk category so different rules than what applies for Canada and UK.I would follow Barbados GIS for the rules and subsequent changes. That is a gov't information site."

I believe I saw here that the first US flights have been pushed back from July 25th to September? Unless something changes things will be the same or worse come fall for the US. I predict the September arrival to be pushed out further. Non maskers have to be addressed. Maybe Barbados should automatically assume they are positive- test and quarantine them. No mask no entry.
"Jemma, I'm appalled to hear that the Captain didn't intervene regarding these mindless morons, but then the Airlines want no responsibilty when it comes to Covid.  I really hope these people tested negative or we could have massive trouble on our hands from just one flight. Seems to me some visitors need an IQ test before they set off to ensure they have more than half a brain and that they can use it sensibly ."
omg Westie....the flights would be more than half empty if that were the case!
"Just read that one of the passengers on yesterday's BA flight tested positive on arrival.He was a 76 year old Barbadian.Edited: 12:28 pm, July 19, 2020 "
LOL Naughty Clare B !
"Lets, the news this morning is now saying the crisis in the US is spiraling out if control. IMO it will be a while before Americans will be welcomed to Barbados. Yesterday there were 65,400 new cases in the US.Edited: 12:33 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"NC yes it's bad here. I need to do some investigative reading. I know that in some cases positive antibody test/numbers are added into the totals. Not sure if its everywhere or just some states. I also know that each time the same person is tested it gets counted as a new case if they test positive. So if someone was positive and they need test negative to return to work each time they repeat a test it counts as an additional new case. I am sure these factors dont make a dent or change much but I dont trust how they come up with the daily totalsEdited: 12:59 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"re#100- Oh ,NO! - I wonder if that passenger has infected those sitting around him.?.. - there will need to be a lot of contract tracing as apparently those other passengers are free to move around and interact with others!"
"This thread has made me feel much better about my potential holiday in December.One question I have, and apologies if this has been answered previously (I’ve read so much information and it changes all the time, that I get a bit lost), is why do you need the test 72 hours before, if you have to have one on arrival anyway??"
"You don't. It is either or, or if the neg test you bring is not acceptable, then re-tested at BGI."
"Oh no holidaybunny good grief wonder what that will mean for everyone, how can you possibly know who he's come into contact with, going to the toilet etc. This is exactly my concern."
"Yes, uktripfan, absolutely agree and the fact that the wearing of masks wasn't being enforced is outrageous."
"They are all being monitored (but not quarantined) so that is a start. They could be asked to limit the number of people they interact with and keep a log of those they do.. still not a big chore. Better than a 7 day qurantine!Edited: 2:31 pm, July 19, 2020 "
NC - if they went out for dinner - to a bar - etc etc - they won't be able to know who they have interacted/ bee in contact with them - who knows who is next to you in a public location...?
"NC it throws a whole different light on things when someone on the flight tests positive. I did read somewhere that the protocol was 2 rows in front, side and behind if this happenened to quarantine but honestly if people walk around on the flight, go to the toilet etc it is so hard to know who they have come into contact with, absolute nightmare really."
I agree ASO but you should have had a mask on and practiced social distancing while out. As far as the plane hopefully he wore his mask during the flight through the airport taxi and to his accommodation. If people follow the rules their chances of being infected or infecting someone else are much reduced.
It is this scenario that makes the whole testing/quarantine process almost unmanageable on any practical level.
It's hard to eat dinner with a mask on - or have a drink - and are all the restaurants and bars in Barbados now required to have the same literal 2.m/6' physical distance between tables etc as in Canada - and serving at 50% capacity Only? - if not - physical distancing wont work in restaurants or bars - will it?
69 people on that BA flight flew without taking a test. 69 people had to be tested in Barbados. The message isn’t getting through to people.The Government have to enforce testing before boarding.
"ASO all tables are well spaced apart in restaurants in Barbados and no one is allowed to drink at a bar , they can order a drink and take it away outside or to their table but they cannot lime by a bar ."
"Sinclair, It’s good of you to tell everyone of your experience getting to Barbados. I too find it unbelievable that some on the flight didn’t wear masks and weren’t told they must put them on. I find that scary. If so many didn’t have a test before flying it must be because they weren’t aware they needed it or couldn’t get one. It needs to be made clear to travellers. I don’t really think it’s up to the likes of BA to inform people but somewhere along the line travellers should be told what to expect."
I hope that is good enough Westie - and are the barmen and the waitstaff all masked too? (there have been various outbreaks and spikes since bars and restaurants opened here and not just outdoor patios - it is worrying)
"I hope the people with masks off on the plane were not the ones flying without testing.. No one should be allowed on a plane without a test. Period. If they didn't wear it on the plane, probably the most risky time to not wear it- why would the think its important to wear one before or after?"
ASO We sure do a lot of hoping dont we!
letsgo - Oh Yes!
"ASO we were out to a restaurant last night, first time since Barbados in March! The staff are all masked, tables at least twice as far apart as pre-covid. I saw everything from our table go to a certain place to be disinfected before going back to the kitchen. You are allowed to take your mask off while at your table but if you leave the table you must put it back on. No one allowed at the bar. Everyone we saw was following the rules. Obviously all this is new to the servers (our province only opened up Friday) so they were awkward and will have to get used to the ""new normal"".Jackiee Air Canada has the requirements of other island nations in the Caribbean that they fly to posted on their website but nothing for Barbados. I think they haven't receieved clear and concise regulations from Barbados yet. If they have I can't think of a reason why they would not post for their passengers. Does BA not post anything?I agree Lets. It should be mandatory to have a neg covid test before even checking in never mind boarding. A rapid covid antigen test has been approved for use in Canada now so they need to develop a system where passengers can be screened as they enter the airport. That is the only way so far to protect other passengers and crew on the planes. Tracking people after the fact is much more cumbersome, labour intensive and I really think not as safe."
"ASO, of course all the Barmen, Wait staff, Greeters, Managers ,everyone coming into contact with customers wear masks here, why would you think any different ? The only cases of Covid 19 we have had in Barbados have been brought in !!!"
I am in the same situation as Juli P. Booked to go to Bdos mid August. Just wondering the BA flight that just landed a day or so ago with one positive case - most of the passengers had done the 72hr tests - where did they get them done? Private? Or NHS? Wondering which test labs immigration authorities are accepting as there seems to be a lot of private london based options. But are they reputable? And the cost!
"Oh Good Westie - I saw those photos of Drake and wondered what the ""scene"" was really like!"
"Well ASO If you want to party outside in the Gap , then maybe that’s what it’s like , but in bars and restaurants it isn’t .  No one was wearing a mask on 1st Street last night which is mainly why I didn’t go . The trouble is we have all felt safe for some time now, causing us to relax a little , but I thought there may be some people off BA there so I want going to risk it .  Now I know about the Positive case , I’m jolly glad I didn’t ."
I'm glad too Westie - keep safe xx
"NC, this is all I can see on the BA website.‘Please visit the local government's website and complete any entry requirements before travelling.‘ Maybe someone else knows more but with the protocols constantly changing I don’t suppose BA can do otherwise."
Hi. We are going to get nhs test as drive in place by us. As Sinclair stated in previous post it is accepted but try get backed up by your GP if possible
Where did you hear that Bimfan? It doesn't surprise me sadly.
We had friends on the BA flight yesterday and they have been advised to stay in thier apartments for the next 7 days they had a negative test result which they got from our local NHS drive in centre and recieved it within 48 hours. However they where phone late evening to inform them that someone on the flight has tested positive and have now been asked to self isolate.Of course they had stopped at Emerald City to do some shopping on route to The Crane as they assumed they where safe to do so.Our friends sent me a photo of check in at Heathrow yesterday morning and after seeing that photo I have serious doubts about travelling anywhere for some time.there was no social distancing not everyone was wearing face coverage.I worry for Barbados and can not see our New Year trip going ahead I certainly would not of wanted to be in the crowd at Heathrow yesterday morning.
I have just change my profile photo to the scene at Heatrow yesterday morning not sure how else to attach the photo
"rkaty thanks for the updates and sorry for your friends, not how they wanted to start their holiday, I am sure. Wow that is scary seeing your Heathrow picture, I can't believe that. You'd think it would be mandatory to wear a mask before entering the airport! It makes you despair doesn't it, things are never going to get better whilst things like this are going on :o( I agree with you, I wouldn't want to be in that crowd either! and that is before a lot of flights have restarted, imagine what it will be like when it starts to get busier."
So what about the BA flight Crew. What happens to them now? Were they allowed to fly back to Heathrow with a new set of Passengers from here ?
"I thought it was mandatory to wear a face mask but she said loads of them where wearing them on thier chins,she was surprised how busy it was as she had expected it to be fairly quiet.On the positive side she said the arrival into Barbados was very well organised.We are now considering cancelling our trip as I dont want to be stressing about the trip for the next 6 months."
Westie I hadn't thought about the cabin crew not sure how that works out.Our friend recieved the phone call and thankfully hadn't gone out for dinner she said the guy they spoke to was very apologetic and said this is all still very fluid at the moment they have to take temperature twice a day and report the results daily.I suppose these things are going to change as thing develope.
"I hope your friends don’t end up with it rkaty.  Just when will the Government decide that no one must fly without a test ? Until then, this will keep happening over and over again . It’s utterly ridiculous ."
"I completely agree,you shouldn't be travelling without a test.It was very straightforward for our friends to get a test she didnt have to give a reason she booked one online just drove into Portsmouth and the turn around was quick so there seems no reason for not getting one if your coming from the UK.I was pleased when she told me as that seemed to be a deal breaker for me as we had managed to get insurance sorted as well .However now I am not sure how this is going to work out and I worry for the people of Barbados."
Westie .. and others .I so agree ... no negative test no boarding ...simples !!! Change the rules..... It is completely outrageous that they were allowed to put other passenger at risk and potentially ruin their holiday They may not have had any symptoms but that is not the point I suspect that with the difficulty (without a white lie) and cost of getting a test in the UK within 72 hours a number of people are not bothering - just taking a risk on the test at GABarbados can help by saying that there will be no admittance without a negative test at departure ...it will also save them time and money !!!I know this 72 hour test is not 100% safe due to the varying length of the infectious period but is will reduce the risk considerably We REALLY NEED the rapid test at departure to be approved .so that the risk is reduced further
IMO .....The airline T&Cs should also be amended - so that any passenger not wearing a mask can be arrested at the destination and then sent back to originating country ...with a massive fine...this is what they do with drunks ...and they are not so dangerous when compared with spreading the virusThis will not stop SOME trying to be irresponsible but may well make them think twice. Crew cannot physically force a passenger to wear a mask but a significant punishment will helpWalking around without permission should be handled in the same way ....unless they have a full medical exemption - they then should have a visor
"I assume the BA crew does not overnight in Barbados since there are no daily return flights yet. They must have brought a fresh crew on that plane for the return. That means both crews were as suseptable as the passengers to becoming infected from this person. So both sets of crew and both plane loads of passengers, cleaners plus who ever he was in contact with at both airports are all in the same boat. I wonder if Barbados has notified BA. Also the test result would not have been known until the next day. If people would just follow the rules and wear a mask or face shield life would be easier and safer.This should show the Barbados gov't and airlines that a neg test is required before boarding. They should start to realize that the 37 hour window is not always possible."
"sinclair ....I appreciate you have been asked many questions .... and huge thanks for your replies so farA couple of important questions have now been buried somewhat !!!... could I ask that you please have another look at posts # 83 ,85 and 88Thanks"
"I understand it's an airline and it might be for naught but EVERYONE on that plane, and everyone due to fly should be contacting them, by email and phone, ovewhelm them and ask why they are letting people remove masks and wander the plane. Demand answers and demand that no one flys or is allowed to step foot into the plane and destination without a mask AND a test. I am sure they know that a plane load of their customers are sitting in their rooms for 7 days,and more importantly exposed to a potentialy deadly virus. I understand that it is a risk when you choose to fly and ultimately we are responsible for ourselves but they need to have some accountability. Did any of these passengers know that this was a possibility should they have a positive case on board with them? As consumers we have to speak up. Truth to the saying ""the squeaky wheels get the grease"". I have gone by the name squeaky many times. How many people on that plane? What a shame."
"""""""and everyone due to fly should be contacting them, by email and phone, ovewhelm them and ask why they are letting people remove masks and wander the plane""""""Good idea ...could start here alex.cruz@ba.comCould someone please post Flight Number and departure date/time and airport"
Mdp I am sure in the fine print when you book your ticket one probably agrees that they the airlines are not responsible for any...inconvenience or hardship due to covid but still everyone speak up!! I hope everyone on the plane has travel insurance to cover any additional expenses to their trip due to Covid. I remember a thread about the Government having worries about possible litigation. I suspect these type of situations are exactly what they were concerned about. Who's fault would it be if someone does become dearly ill that was on the plane. This it itself is a whole other topic-or is it.
"I may have missed it but has anyone said that the return flight departed, if so where did the crew come from and if the existing crew or spare crew that travelled out on the plane was used that's potentially another plane load of infected people, and surely the plane would need a special deep clean."
I questioned that in #144.
"I was looking for an answer.Edited: 8:37 am, July 20, 2020 "
"Good question about the planes departure from Barbados. Couldn't have been many on it?arbados is on the later side of opening up to incoming flights. Looking at other forums- positive passengers have arrived in other locations. Not sure how those are/were being handled by the other islands/airlines. Its gonna happen. Best chance for it not to happen is to rapid test before your flight at the airport. Even still there are false negatives and those who dont have enough viral load to test positive yet. You cant stop the virus but minimize as much as possible. Long term I cant see each plane load of people being sent to their room for 7 days. It's going to happen a lot. What you do want to see is every precaution taken for it not to happen.I feel for the people having to figure this out. The airlines, the Governments...its messy and I understand in many ways its make the rules up as you go. Which I think is why its imperative that consumers speak up and maybe, just maybe their experiences might be taken into consideration when decisions are made as to how to deal with situations as they arrive."
British Airways crew are overnighting in Barbados. Virgin will do the same. The inbound flight will arrive on Saturday for example and return on SundayBA uses Hilton and Virgin uses Radisson.Regards
"So BGI-------------------the whole of the BA Crew are in Quarantine for 7 days then ? like all the passengers are having to be , following that Positive test on some idiot that thought he could fly without a test --------------in fact over 6o idiots in this case . This begs another question. If Airline Crews are staying in Hotels here as usual, are THEY flying with negative tests ??Edited: 9:44 am, July 20, 2020 "
You beat me to it Westie and all the return passengers are still in Barbados.
Flight Radar is showing BA 2154 left Barbados at 6.20 pm yesterday !!!
"They would have to fly out another plane with 2 crews wouldn't they? I am surprised they overnight. Did they always??Westie he may not be an idiot. Barbados offered him the choice, test in the UK (and probably pay) or test in Barbados free. He may also not have had time to get the test done. Are there 60 passengers that did not have a test done before leaving?"
"I give up, on BA website it says cancelled."

So they flew a contaminated plane and crew back to the UK?
"Don't know, as I say Flight Radar says it left and BA website says it 's cancelled."
"Flightstats also says it left and arrived at Gatwick at 06.54, maybe someone with a deeper access to these stats than me can have a look at it."
"It was announced months ago that BA and Virgin’ cabin crew would overnight in Barbados and fly back as crew a day later. The crew would be tested before each leg of the journey and the plane sanitised thoroughly.BA 21554 left BGI one hour late on its return to LGW yesterday it arrived in LGW 16 minutes late this morning.Edited: 11:18 am, July 20, 2020 "
BA 2154 not 21554
"Thanks, that's what I found, so it depends on whether the return crew were already in Barbados or flew out on the same plane."
N C THere were 218 passengers on the plane of which 69 people did not have validated tests and had to be tested on arrival. So nearly 1/3rd of passengers did not have tests !! Unacceptable !
The same crew flew on both the inbound and outbound plane.
Time for Boris to offer free testing with no restrictions. Also time for BA to enforce the rules and company policy and for Barbados to reconsider the 37 hour limit. What makes 37 hours so magical anyway? Maybe they should consider the rapid covid antigen test approved in Canada for testing at BGI. At least they would get the results faster and know if a plane and crew have been contaminated. Since they wouldn't know the passenger is pos I guess the crew were not in quarantine for the night.
Sorry I mean 72 hours not 37.
"Thanks Joanlems.Edited: 12:15 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Hi Steve, unfortunately I cannot currently access the link, due to being on Bajan WiFi NHS website will not let me access the test site as it’s for UK access only. There should be a part where it asks if you’ve returned to work within the last 2 week. That is what I selected and allowed me to book a test. I hope this helps"
Sinclair --------------I believe you arrived on BA on Saturday ? Are you now being made to quarantine in your accommodation because of that Positive test ?
"Unfortunately money talks.......so the idea of empty seats between passengers didn’t happen. zero spacing between passengers. I travelled in a party of four, all Covid tested and negative. Told a check in that we’d all be seated together, which would make logical sense to me, only to be told once we boarded that we’d be split.......I flat out refused to the steward that none of our party under any circumstances would be sitting next to anyone unless they could produce to me a negative test result there and then. After a couple of minutes stand off they relented and seated us together."
"No Sinclair,, please see the thread entitled Monitoring the real meaning. People are saying that everyone on your flight has been made to quarantine in your accommodation for 7 days because of the positive test.  If you are still free to enjoy your holiday please post on that thread, or even this one if you want. WE just need to know the truth about that flight"
"Why on earth would BA try to split the party of 4 makes no sense? I have already booked our seats for 15th August - obviously all together. It sounds to me that the talk of quarantine for 7 days is not factual - more so the monitoring, as per the protocals - the Situation Dashboard as of yesterday does not show 218 in Isolation / quarantine https:/…"
https:/…Westie seems like not all have been told to self isolate from this story but worryingly people near the positive person on the plane have been sent to the Government facility too. The lady with an apartment she rents out makes very good points. They need to be honest with people that this could be a possibility on their flight.
"Well all of this has convinced me that Barbados is not currently the place to travel to. We were booked to travel to Barbados in August but the holiday was cancelled, primarily because Southern Palms is closed and isn't reopening until 1st October. I was seriously considering booking to go out for a week in October and would happily have had a COVID 19 test prior to travelling, unfortunately it seems that others aren't getting tested beforehand and are testing positive for COVID 19 on arrival, the thought of being placed in mandatory quarantine for what could potentially be the entire duration of my holiday is too much of a risk and has convinced me to give it a miss this year, must be the first time in about 20 odd years that I won't be visiting, such a shame. Hopefully things will calm down and get easier next year, in the meantime I think I'll look for something a little closer to home in Europe."
"That's a scandal - no way would I accept being transported to a government facility in Barbados, after having taken the time and expense to have a test pre flight for myself and my family. All should be tested prior to the flight and either prove negative or be prevented from boarding."
"It should be so simple really. If you want to enter Barbados, you need proof of a negative test. It’s really not complicated. All this testing on arrival with the possibility of quarantine if someone on your flight tests positive is nonsense. There are Drive through testing areas in UK everywhere, no need to explain anything you just turn up and have your test done. If you’re worried about not getting the results on time, go private. If you can afford a holiday in Barbados you can afford a covid test. The current protocol is like playing Russian roulette, you could be allowed in but you could not, ridiculous"
"Sunflower ....""""""There are Drive through testing areas in UK everywhere, no need to explain anything you just turn up and have your test done""""""Myself and others have been trying to establish how you can get a NHS test in the UK without incorrectly stating that you have symptomsAre you saying that you can just arrive at a test station - without an appointment - and have a test with out stating that you have symptoms ????From evidence I have following 2 visits (with appointments ) .... they have an abundance of capacity!!"
"You can also just click the section that just says NO symptoms its that simple.Edited: 6:25 am, July 21, 2020 "
"Thanks - but to be clear at MDP queried, you can't just turn up at a testing station - you do need to book online and click 'no symptoms' from what you have said ?"
"Mdp...Yes that’s what I’ve heard. You turn up and have a test, no need to lie about symptoms. Last week a friend of mine needed a negative result as she had an antibody test at a chemist and it was positive. She suspected she’d had COVID a few months ago and just wanted to find out. Because she tested positive to the antigen test, her employer wanted her to have a Covid test so she went to the drive through, no questions asked and had a test. Another friend had one as she was desperate to visit her parents and wanted reassurance that she was clear so she had one too, no questions asked. In both cases, the testing facility was quiet, no queues.Edited: 6:40 am, July 21, 2020 "
"Hi Discerning joe, from what i can gather the yes/no symptoms section has been added to allow many more people to access a test for various reasons like return to work ect ect. In the last few wks testing capacity has increased by thousands & will continue to do so, opening it up to more of the population. This is my understanding will continue to happen, but yes you do need to book a test or apply for home testing"
I agree with Louise B ... just tested it 3 times .... on the 'new' websiteThis is so important that I intend to start a new topic on it
Sunflower .... Thanks for that So also my comments in 'new' Topic on this matter if need be sit out side test centre and book immediate test https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147…
thanks - very helpful to know
Hi dani did the uk postal test results get you in ok??
mellygry ....Welcome to the ForumThis topic has been inactive for over 3 weeks ...not sure who your question is aimed at ...???
"Just a comment from someone who just arrived in Barbados. Be careful about the 72 hours requirement. On arrival they are very strict about the fact that the test must have been TAKEN within 72 hours. If the results are within the 72 hours but the test date is not, they will not accept it and you will have to be retested and wait for results either at the airport or in an approved government facility."
"Just read the BA flight from the 13th had a positive covid test passenger on arrival at BGI and as a consequence have made the whole flight quarantine until they retest at 5-7 days. That seems different to the normal protocol of a few rows, just wondering why the change?"
"@uktripfan, could you expand on where you read that, as it would be bad news and confusing. However, we had exactly the same reports last time, and it turned out to have been wrongly reported and was only people sitting nearby. Still very annoying for those people of course."
"It was on the Barbados Traveladvisor Facebook page, a lady on the flight got called and asked to quarantine and the lady who rang said in that instance they'd quarantined the full flight, just made me wonder why if true? Be good if anyone knows any further information."
"I wonder if that's monitor vs. quarantine perhaps. Anyway, as you say, it would be good to know the actual situation - given the lack of reported person to person spread from previous flights, it would seem very odd if they'd actually done this."
She said she had to remain in her accommodation so not just monitoring. It seems bizarre the whole flight that's why I wondered if there was further information.
"... perhaps just yet more crossed wires and messed up comms, but will be very interesting to see."
"Hi! I know there are a million topics on this and I have tried to look through all. I am concerned to which test time to book can I clarify it is 72 hours prior to departure and not arrival to BGI? I travel at 13:30 on the virgin flight out of LHR on Saturday 22nd, so I am torn between getting the last test slot tonight or early AM tomorrow. I have already had two Covid tests done just over a week ago (one incon and one neg) and it took around 24/26 hours to come back.Sorry for repeated question - thank you!!"
Oleta .......that test time should be OK ...based on your previous timescale and that of many others ....being 20 > 28 hoursIt is now definitely 72 hours prior to departure Just remember to take a printout of your booking Email .......with date time etc and then a printout of the Email advising the result ...and if you get one ...a receipt from the test station
Juliet S ... you statement is contrary that has been reported by people arriving in Barbados from the UKFrom the UK the test should be within 72 hours of DEPARTURE ...and that is it. Reports (on this Forum) are saying that ........even if the flight is delayed in leaving the UK the authorities in Barbados have been understanding
Great thank you so much Mdp!
"What test did you have? You anyone recommend a laboratory please, I was told the NHS tests are not being accepted."
We were told at the airport that it was 72 hours prior to arrival. But I may well be wrong. I hope I am as I have someone travelling on the 22nd as well. Any recommendations on where to get the test in London?
"Hi Juliet S Sorry were you told this when arriving into BGI or before departing?I am getting tested this evening however this will be within 72 hours prior to departure and 74 hours prior to arrival. ThanksEdited: 12:50 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Juliet S …Re: #191“””Just a comment from someone who just arrived in Barbados.”””…. So not your own experience …or are you now in Barbados ???Where did this person depart from …the Barbados authorities may be more strict with some countriesAs I said in #200 … it is not the experience of those arriving from the UK and the protocol is now clearly 72 before DEPARTURE …not arrival Re: #203 “””We were told at the airport that it was 72 hours prior to arrival. But I may well be wrong.”””You are wrong as far as the UK is concernedOriginally it was 72 hours prior to arrival but that was impractical, and it was changedWhich airport was it ???PLEASE be careful about posting information without being very specific - you may cause some to worry about the protocols presently in placeThe latest version of the Barbados Protocols can be found here …. It should be read very carefully https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020There is chapter and verse in a number if Topics ( including this one ) on how to get a FREE NHS test in the UK I am not going to repeat it all here. The other topics you should read are https:/…107628849https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147…A print out of the Email confirming booking time and date …plus a printout of the Email giving a result is also requiredPrivate test are available in the UK ...at a price but the results may take longer - especially if it involves a weekend"
"Have booked to go to Barbados for two weeks in October, seems to be quite difficult to get a Covid test and results in the 72 hour window before arrival, thinking of cancelling. Fortunately we booked thorough BA and can cancel three weeks before departure with a full refund, perhaps go somewhere like the Canaries instead at half the cost. I am not bothered about the 14 day quarantine upon return as have been home for five months anyway ....Edited: 5:11 pm, August 19, 2020 "
ajp9000....I do not understand why you are finding it so difficult to get a test....what have you tried so far ???If you go to the Canaries ...at present it is against FCO advice and you may not have or be able to get insurance cover
"Thanks, I asked my GP who could offer no advice and checked some websites, one of the issues is certainty as my understanding is the test needs to be carried out 72 hours before ARRIVAL, so we would leave UK at 11am on a Tuesday and arrive UK time 8pm, so means the earliest we could do the test is 8pm on the Saturday (where is open at that time?) and then get the result late on the Monday evening - all assumes it goes to plan. The advantage of the Canaries is you are covered for health treatment under the E111.Edited: 2:50 am, August 20, 2020 "
"Yes but you’re not covered as comprehensively as with the NHS as far as I know. You’re also not covered for delays, being brought home if ill or lost luggage. The web site advise to get travel insurance too. We’d like to go to Southern Spain as we cancelled earlier but won’t go without insurance. I’d prefer Barbados but hopefully that’ll be next year.Edited: 4:14 am, August 20, 2020 "
"ajp9000 ....Seems as though you are keen to go to the Canaries !!! ..even with only basic medical cover and presently no travel insuranceThere is also the chance that Spain (and other countries) may introduce protocols that require a negative test prior to departure or testing on arrival, as the UK is consideringThe ""72 hours before arrival"" is old hat and was impracticable ...it is now 72 hours prior to departure -100%Some GPs are, as you have found out (and so did I) , not the best for advice on Covid testingPlease take a look at post #205 aboveIn that, I have given 3 key links - covering the Barbados Protocols and FREE NHS testing ...which is open 7 days a week and will normally send you the Email with your result in 20>28 hours Also read this topic ...backwardsPlease read every thing carefully .... perhaps starting with the OP and then the most recent Leaving the UK and getting into Barbados is not simple ...the protocols are there to protect the Bajan people but it is possible ...with self education and planning Good Luck"
"Thanks, and to be clear I would much rather go to Barbados, but I want to reduce the risk of some unintentional minor transgression of the rules as much as possible. I will look at the references you kindly provided. We have three weeks before we need to make a final decision, so here's hoping...."
Hi! Were you allowed in with the NHS test? Thank you for your help
".#206 #207The Canary Islands in partnership with AXA announced two weeks ago that all holidaymakers are automatically covered for coronavirus related incidents provided they are staying in tourist accommodation and not with friends or family - and also that they had no signs of the virus before travelling.The cover includes all health expenses, health repatriation and extended stays necessitated by quarantine for those testing positive for COVID-19 whilst staying on the island.Obviously the Islands are suffering from the lack of tourism and obviously hope this new free insurance cover will give people the confidence to travel there.Emirates also offer a similar interesting scheme to encourage travellers.I think that we might well see more of this kind of cover in the future..Edited: 5:33 am, August 20, 2020 "
BB ....Re: 213Very interesting info ...thanks .....we are with AXA via Lloyds BankDo you have a link for this info ???Is it just the Canaries so far ???Are villas/ condos/apartments classified as tourist accommodation ..or just hotels ??? .....and do you have to have a negative test before travelling ...to prove you have no signs ???
"Email from BA this afternoon, flight cancelled, so looks like holiday is off...."
ajp9000 What a shame ..so sad for youDid they say why ??? When were you due to fly ???
"Annoying as 4th holiday cancelled (not that we were going on four holidays and only booked this one a month ago...), just got an email yesterday saying cancelled, but not reason - Flight BA2155 6th Oct LGW/BGI - I see the one two days later is cancelled also. Could be lack of demand, when I look d the other day there were only 4 seats reserved in Club World. Have not contacted BA yet as undecided what to do, could go the next day or been looking at Antigua where the Covid test is 7 days prior, not 72 hours.Edited: 4:23 am, August 21, 2020 "
"travelling you can it done privately 7 days a week to fit in with the 72 hours. I would strongly say it is must for the test to safe guard (you will know either way) and being altruistic general wellbeing of all on the plane. Barbados now have a 14 days quaratine, so if your holiday is 14 days iam sure you would not want to spend it with men in white suits. Pay and take the test I heard quaratine is not nice"
"Following the cancellation of our trip to Barbados by BA, we are now booked for Antigua where the test requirement is seven days before travel.Edited: 5:40 pm, August 26, 2020 "
"jendev....another confirmation ...less than 24 hours !!!...???Great stuff ... Enjoy !!!Edited: 8:35 am, August 27, 2020 "
thanks MDP and yes Chris G think facebook page will be updated very soon :)))! x And yes hank's for all the advise and updates everyone over the last few months
When booking nhs test what reason did you give as travel is t listed. Did you put other? Thanks
"Sorry if I have missed this if the question has already asked , but the Protocol for medium risk countries mentions a 2nd test during your stay , is this for everyone even if you arrive with a negative test ?"
"Hi durie . You should read the latest Protocols set on 3rd August . Just go to visit barbados . .Org and look for them  When you arrive with a negative test you will be told to take and record your temperature twice a day and notify the Ministry each day for 14 days .  However , you can elect to take another test 5 to 7 days after the first one, and if that is negative you will be free to enjoy your holiday in peace .  At the moment , Immigration has run out of thermometers to give to visitors , so make sure you bring your own .  Have a great holiday .Edited: 6:08 pm, August 28, 2020 "
Coogie....Yes ... it is 'other'
hi Coogle we put reason away other and had no issues x
"Ok thank you , think I will give it’s miss ☹️"
