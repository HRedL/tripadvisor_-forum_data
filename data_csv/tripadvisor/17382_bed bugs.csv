What are comments of people who have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria? Clean? Any bed bugs?
doyou know of oyster.com?The Waldorf isnt what it was.
Have you read the reviews here on TA? Doing so will help you come to an informed decision:tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93618-R…
"Any bed bugs at the Waldorf? Well, it depends; for example, are you planning on bringing any with you?"
"bedbugregistry.com/hotel/…The-Waldorf-AstoriaI can't say how accurate this website is, but I use it as a quick reference point when I am looking at NY hotels. As suefee suggested, TA reviews is a good way to go, and a much more thorough way of checking out this issue."
I wouldnt bother with the registry tbh - any decent hotel will act fast when they are aware of a bedbug problem.
"On our previous 6 visits to NYC not one bed bug have we come across yet,don't expect to see any next year as wellEdited: 8 years ago "
"Have you heard about the beagles who inspect and detect bed bugs? I know people who moved and hired a company with beagles to not only go throughtheir new abode, but they also inspected the moving truck before they puttheir furniture in it. The point is that there is a lot of prevention available anda place like the Waldorf knows about these things, but for my buck there areother iconic places to stay that have more updated rooms."
No issues it seems with people who have recently stayed there and it seems to be a very busy hotel. Check the reviews.
Hiya I used bedbug registry.com 2 yrs ago when I visited NY as the bedbugs were an official epidemic then- not sure if it's still up to date ? But worth a try.
"I've been using the bed bug registry as well...but the reality is...a room is only as clean as it's last visitor. In other words, I'm not relying too heavily on it. I think inspecting the room upon arrival will be most helpful.That being said, there are some very popular hotels on that registry with many reports...some as recent as yesterday. I cross those off, immediately."
"Problem w/ the bedbug registry is that anybody who has a grudge with the hotel can post whether or not it is true. The reviews are different ....somebody can post a bad review, but others will offset it w/ good reviews if warranted, with the BbRegistry, you only post 'bad' stuff."
"^ agreed.And, a hotel room that had bed bugs a month ago or a year ago means nothing when the day before you arrive someone else stays in the room you stay in and brings them in."
"I hate the thought of bedbugs, but I hate the thought of not visiting Manhattan more. If you find the risk to be too much, by all means stay at home. But know that most Manhattan reputable hotels take care of such problems ASAP."
