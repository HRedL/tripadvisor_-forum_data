"Curious if this is basically unlucky tourists that read TA. The home owner we rented from appeared oblivious to this site and swore they had heard of none of the issues everyone is experiencing. I guess if I owned property and depended on people to return I’d be a little concerned that this place will die out. Reading alone the horror stories of weddings gone bad I foresee a shuttered Villa Amore that depended on all those guests spending thousands of dollars... really a shame that there is no ownership of what appears to be a growing issue. Hopefully San Pancho is not the next town to be ruined as we truly love coming down to both cities. If you own property, curious as to what measures you all are taking to drive change."
you can see what some property owners say in this thread going back to 2015... https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g44505…Edited: 1 year ago

"The answer is yes, many property owners do read the posts and are aware of the situation, are working very hard to clean the town and get Sayulita's infrastructure, waste treatment plant etc. up to par. You can read on other threads steps that the town, propelled primarily by property owners, has already taken and continues to take. I'm extremely surprised that your rental property owner appeared oblivious. But I just read another new post by William F who is an investor in a small hotel here who knew absolutely nothing about it so I guess he and your rental owner prove that not all owners here do read and not all do clean."
"The Norovirus is definately affecting this town , I as a home owner & rental unit do all my own cleaning of the apt. we rent out & thouroughly clean everything with a 99.9% germ free solution & have had only a couple of guests who have been under the weather for only 1 day & they were the ones who ate from vendors on the beach or went swimming in the water.I was shocked to read about all the people who have been really sick here & think something should be done about curbing all the new buildings that are going up as the water & sewage system seems unable to cope with such an excesisve amount of building. I am on the town sewage system & every now & again when the town flushes out their tanks we get the most horrible stench coming up through the pipes & permeates the whole house for about an hour & when this happens you are actually breathing in toxic gases. Until the town can deal with these issues I think all new bulding should be stopped."

"I agree with you 100% Jacqueline. There are far too many new hotels going in right now. I also think ""destination weddings"" should be stopped for a year or so. One person gets sick and then they end up infecting half the people in the group. As for the smell coming up through the pipes, we're also on the town system and thankfully don't have that issue. I wonder what the problem is."
"Chris, does the homeowner you rent from have a review site on TA? or do they rent using TA? That might answer your question."
"We stayed at Villa Amor March 24-30, 2019. 4/4 of us got violently ill. When we spoke to hotel representatives they denied there was a problem despite the smell of sewage and that we can clearly see the sewage pipe dumping into the public beach from our Pacifico Villa. After we returned to the US I contacted Villa Amor to ask them to warn their customers about the Norovirus epidemic. They questioned whether we truly had the Norovirus and asked for medical proof (my husband and I are both physicians). Villa Amor also denied knowledge of an epidemic which is criminal.Edited: 1 year ago "
