"Hi trippers,We are from Australia and would like some help from any local Orlando people to help us check out eCruisestore.com. They are located at:eCruiseStore.com7025 CR46ASuite 1071-502Heathrow, FL 32746The reason behind this request from any Orlando locals is that we are looking at booking a Caribbean cruise through them and would like any info from people who may have booked with them before.The info that we require is: are eCruisestore.com reliable, reputable and do they actually have an office or are they just an internet front for a dodgy travel service.If any one has any info on this company that would be truly fantastic for us, so we can book our cruise with the confidence that we are not going to get ripped off and have the trip of our lives.Thanks so much,Aussie travellers Jezkim"
"I haven't booked with this company or heard anything about it. We usually book directly with the cruise company the last few years. As a few years ago you were able to get better deals from a travel agent then direct with the cruiseline. But a few years ago the cruiselines cut out the discounts the travedl agents were able to give, so usually the cruiselines have the best deals. The only things travel agents can offer is little things usually like a bottle of champagne or if you are lucky a night at a hotel. But usually not much.So I would check out the prices directly with the cruiseline. If you haven't already do so."
I've had dealings with eCruiseStore before and they did a wonderful job for me. And they gave me a terrific discount off what the cruise line gave me directly. I live in the Orlando area and would highly recommend them to anyone. Very efficient and friendly.
"I have had the unfotunate experience of dealing with Ecruisestore.com.This ""AGENCY"" is as dodgy as it gets. I do not know if they have a store front but after doing some research into the company and the owner (after having one of the worst experiences with a travel agency in my life. ) I found out this company consistently has people complain about them. Apparently the owner's last ""AGENCY"" collapsed when 5 or 6 of the agents quit at the same time in protest of the owners business practices. I have used Cruisecompete.com 8 or 9 times and have never had a problem until now.To start with the ""Agent"" if you could call her that, quoted me about $600 per person too much. Then I was told that the flights I wanted could not be done for the price I had been quoted by Princess directly. She then convinced me that her in-house flight dept could make the reservations at approx the same cost. The only catch was I would have to pay for the flights in full up front. As I wanted to get things moving I gave my credit card number a told her to book the flights and cruise.The next day I get a call telling me that my card has been rejected when trying to book the deposit for the cruise. (I know full well there was 1000s of dollars of credit available.) But to get the process moving along I gave another card number.I then get another call late in the day telling me that their flight dept made a mistake and booked me on a return flight for a cruise that starts in one place and ends over 4000 kilometers away. At this point I now am booked on the cruise paid the deposit but no longer have flights.Ok so at this point I am ready to cancel. When I am told there is a 10% or $500 cancelation policy. My options are pay the money to the incompetent company for messing up or invest more of my time and make them work for any and every dollar of commission.I chose the later as there is nothing I hate more than rewarding someone for messing up. So after all was said and done my flights were booked through Princess for exactly the price I had been quoted the first day I spoke to the cruiseline. Sounds to me like the ""AGENT"" was trying to generate a little extra money for the company by booking the flights through themselves instead of through the cruiseline. Took them a full week to rebate my credit card for the bad flights they booked me on.I get an invoice earlier the following week and guess what? They are attempting to overcharge me AGAIN!! I quickly call and explain that the invoice is not for the correct amount and ask them to resend with the correct amounts. They send a new invoice and again it is incorrect. At this point you can imagine how frustrated I am getting, but it was my mistake for not cutting my losses and paying the cancelation fee. Anyway, after another heated exchange with the ""AGENT"" and the accounting department I am billed the correct amount and credited the right amount as originally agreed.Adding final insult to injury I made the mistake of giving them my work email address so they could forward the invoice to me and what do they do? They sell my email and I am now getting junk mail. I know it was them because I have never told this internal email to anyone prior to giving it to ecruisestore.com employees. Not even my family has access to this particular email addy.Anyway, Long story short (i guess it wasnt too short after all) DON'T USE ECRUIESTOR.COM unless you would like to be overcharged, treated with contempt, and spammed.WORST TRAVEL AGENCY EVER!!!!!!Happy Cruising!"
"I have to say that I am also extremely disappointed with ecruisestore in the handling of my reservation. I prepaid back in May for a cruise this upcoming December and find out today that my confirmation number is no good and that Celebrity charged my credit card another $5000 for a different confirmation number. Calling ecruisestore was fruitless as all I kept receiving was a busy signal. When they finally responded to my urgent email requests, the ""agent"" at ecruisestore said the new confirmation was correct (what happened to the confirmation number I had since May -- they still have not given me a response on that one???) and they would work on getting the 5K credited to my card. For some reason they will not call me although I have repeatedly requested that on all my corespondence and they will only respond with emails. So where am I at right now -- waiting for a response from Celebrity that my confirmation number is good and paid for; waiting for the 5K to get credited to my card; and waiting for updated paperwork from ecruisestore that this fiasco is taken care of. I will NEVER use this company again!!!!"
"I strongly disagree with doggiebus's post. The cruise line does not undercut the agencies, and in many cases the cruise line can not offer specials given to certain agencies. My information is from my friends at Carnival Cruise Line, which is headquartered here in Miami. An independent cruise agency is vitally important to match you with the proper line and ship. If you go directly to one line, you have no objective viewpoint on why to sail with that line. I suggest you find a cruise agency in Australia. I would do business in your own country with a firm that has a chance for repeat business from you. There are numerous lines out of Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Holland America, Costa, Crystal, Celebrity and more. Depending on your personalities and interests, you will feel quite out of place on some cruises and very comfortable and at home with others. Please do not rely on flashy advertising brochures to pick a line and ship. Get professional, independent assistance. I am retired and have no affiliation with any cruise line or agency. I have used agencies to sort through all the hype and find cruises which meet my needs and my temperament."
"Hi there Jezkim,We have used ecruise store to book a cruise booking went fine till they double charged us,they were very apolgetic said they would fix the problem they also said they would meet any costs that we had incurred [ie.currency conversion costs and the like]they did refund the double booked fare but despite many e-mails to this day almost 12 months later still no refund of costs involved the person we have been dealing with over this has been a Richard Tanner.Would suggest you use a different agent.orangelane.New Zealand."
"Never ever in your life use ecruisestore.com for anything. My parents and their friends are now in a bind for using them on a trip that will cost $80,000.00 for 29 people that includes cruise, airfare, land tour, and hotel stay. In January they used cruisecompete.com for a quote and my parents and their friends decided to use ecruisestore.com for the quote they gave. Well, without authorization they tacked on the full charge of everything and said the terms of it was to get the full onboard credit which is only worth $280. If anybody knows better, keeping that much money in bank accounts get more interest than paying full upfront. Now they are battling to fight them on paying an extra $95/person for a fuel charge that was supposed to be included in the price when they paid upfront. They even stated that agreement in the quote that they were given. They have spelled a lot of the groups names wrong on their plane and cruiseline tickets/reservations and I won't be surprised if someone gets left behind since this is a trip to Europe, which is far from the United States, but customs on both ends are not going to let them through if the name doesn't match. Use another travel agent and never look back to using Ecruise Store or Gate 1. Apparently they have other names they go by so watch yourself."
"Take at look at www.crucon.com They are a very large cruise consolidator, based in New Hampshire but they handle most cruise lines/cruises. We and another couple used then last May and found them very reputable and would definitely use them aagain. Since that time . we have met many others who use them too. You don't have to use an Orlando based agency to cruise from Pt. Canaveral- anyone can help you- I am not familiar with the site you mentioned , but based on these posts , I would not use them!You will do much better with a consolidator than booking with the cruise line directly, in my experience. We saved about $300 on a $1500 cruise to the Greek Isles through CruCon.com and had shopped around a lot before choosing them."
"Hi, I've booked 3 cruises all through eCruiseStore.com and have had a great experience. No hassles or problems of any kind. Agent is RC Tanner, he booked me on 2 Royal Caribbean Cruises and 1 Princess. I got terrific prices and amenities from him. He is incredibly knowledgeable, has been to many of the places I was traveling to so he gave me some very helpful information as to what to do when I got to each port. It saddens me to see these other posts on here about him and his agency as he has always been terrific to work with the past 2 years. Give him a chance - believe me you will have a great cruise!"
Gee... SO many reviews from posters with exactly ONE post to their name...
"Hello Everyone, We are from OZ - AND I AM FEELING SICK AFTER REaDING THE POSTS HERE. I posted the cruise I wanted on Cruise Compete for a quote. I chose eCruise and have paid $9500 on the 10th July 2008 for acruise which sails on the 21st August 2009. Ecruise overcharged me $1000 and after letting them know they refunded it straight away then took out a further $5000 without my authorization.  I have been battling to get the refund ever since. My friend has also booked a single cabin through Ecruise at $7500. I am just about to beg/ask again before taking steps through my Visa/Amex agency as advise by my bank/Visa.  I am hoping theat everything will be sorted out. I have to say that I am worried about the situation. Galaxy Cruise and Travel seems to be the booker.I will not post the names of the people I have dealt with they have been mentioned in earlier posts. I do have confirmation No's and will try to sort this out and pray that We are all sent out travel documents prior to our cruise ................. At present I am doing the softly, softly approach and hope the company is not going bust.  I feel foolish booking through this agency when we are in OZ however I thought I ahd done my homework. Cruise comptete was written up in the top 24 sites in the ""New York Times"" with eCruise being a recommended company. Any advice from other T/A members is appreciated.  Nervous!!........... Marnie "
PS This is an Amadaus Waterways Cruise on the Amalegro.
"Well I sure am glad I read TA because I just got a bunch of quotes from Cruise Compete- and guess whose is included...! I certainly won't be doing business with them and will make my feelings known about this issue directly to Cruise Compete. They should not be allowing an unscrupulous firm to participate in the bidding.Maybe some of you would like to fill out an on line complaint form to the FL Attorney general:myfloridalegal.com/Contact.nsf/Contact…Don't know if it will help- but if they get enough of them,, perhaps the AG will take action against them."
"Hi lulutoo,Unfortunately when I booked there was nothing on TA regarding the company. Cruise Compete has been written up many times in all the major papers in the US as a top site.On Cruise Compete eCruise.com are rated as a leading agency. I thought that perhaps they were part of the ownership of the company - is it worth complaining? At present I am just a bit shell shoked by the TA postings and working out my next move. "
"Hahaha sumi2007, true.My message is to the lady who posted just above yours: luv2trvl73; are you perhaps related to that guy who you said managed your bookings?? You seem to really sing his praises. Just a question!"
"Hi Bob Levinstein,CEO Cruise Compete,Thankyou for posting here, taking these issues seriously and looking into them. I realise that eCruise sells a lot of cruises and so mistakes can be made. In my case I have had emails from R.C. Tanner explaining the problem with their processors. He has assured me that the funds will be back in my account by the 3rd of October and has offered me a ships credit for the mistake. He has assured me that he takes complaints seriously and will resolve the problem. I am taking him at his word and believe he will put things right.It is the stress and worry that goes with these situations. The worry over the return of the funds and the hope that the company will deliver on the agreed cruise.To everyone who contacted me thanks. I hope you can have your situations resolved where possible.I will keep you all posted regarding this and the service that I receive from eCruise over the next 11 months to cruise time. I hope I can say here that the service from eCruise was great and that I would use CruiseCompete again.Best wishes to all and happy cruising.Marnie G"
"I also have booked with this agency for my AroundSouth America/Cape Horn cruise with RCCL next Jan.'09. I am taking copies of my invoices along that indicate the amount of OBC's I am entitled to. And they better be there or you will hear a lot of screaming from over 8000 miles away !!! I have some issues with my agent at this company - seems I am booked into ""group space""which leaves me NO options or bargaining tools to get my costs reduced as some of the cabin prices have been lowered since I booked and PAID formy trip. I used to work for a travel agency and wecertainly were more ""pleasent"" and ""accommodating""to our clients. After all, that's how travel agencies survive - repeat customers and recommendations."
"Hello Everyone.I am pleased to announce that I have received a full refund for the outstanding amount plus interest that was withdrawn from my account by mistake by eCruiseStore. Thankyou to RC Tanner and everyone concerned.I am confident that it will all be ""smooth sailing"" from now on until embarkation.Cheers,Marnie"
"Hi Bob Levinson, we've used CruiseCompete with great results for several years now. We want to thank you for your personal interest in the issues with ecruisestore and will e-mail you separately with the problems we've had with them since July.We gratefully appreciate any assistance you can provide."
"My friend booked two insides on a Princess and they (Tanner) has so far double billed her credit card twice, then told her two weeks ago a credit was applied, and so far none has been. She had to protest the unauthorized charges with the credit card company, they then told her to protest the original valid booking charge instead of the unauthorized ones. Stinks to high heavens. I told her to file a complaint with CLIA and the Florida Attorney General. She just wants her unauthorized charge reversed but now has to cancel and reissue the credit card so they don't screw up anymore or worse, she is afraid they will somehow sabbotage her booking on the cruise that departs in 11 days. They have succeeded in making the anticipation of this cruise rotton."
I also was double charged by ECruise Store but that has been resolved.My cruise leaves in two weeks (Jan. 4). Ecruise states they have made final payment on the first leg (but this cannot be verified by the cruise ship) and will make final payment on leg 2 and 3 next week. I am concered that they are getting ready to go out of business and will not make final payments.I used CruiseCompete to find this agency and believed that they were legitimate or would not be listed as a CruiseCompete agency.Question: Has anyone who booked with ECruise had experience where they paid the full amount to Ecruise but EcruiseStore did not make final payment to the cruise line. My credit card company says that since my payment to EcruiseStore was more than 60 days ago I have no recourse with them. My travel insurance also states they will not cover it. Any information or advice is appreciated. 
"Since I posted my inquiry I was informed that we can not solicit or advertise travel agencies on TA so I don't know how to find out the real inside on this agency, it is very frustrating."
"Jill, I would contact Cruise Compete.Marnie"
"Marnie, thanks for suggestion. In fact I just sent them an email.As an update have heard from cruise line that Leg 1 has been paid. Now just working on Leg 2 and 3."
"For what it is worth, I have used CruiseCompete for years, and have had wonderful success. Certainly I saved a great deal of money compared to purchasing directly from the cruise lines.However, I have just discovered two charges on my Amex from Ecruisestore, one for about $3000 on Jan 2 and one for about $1800 on Jan 26. What is weird is that the only future cruise I have at the moment was purchased from another agency (also found via CruiseCompete), so I can not imagine what these charges are for. I will give Ecruisestore 2 days to respond to my email about the charges, and then will contact Amex to block the payments. All I can figure at this point is that Ecruisestore must have me mixed up with another customer.In any case, I will let this thread know the outcome.Bill "
"Read my post here from October 2008. This agency billed my friend all over the board then told her it was the credit card company's fault. She took the cruise in early November and still has issues. It would seem this agency has a habit of double billing, I wonder if it is deliberate. Who knows. I know I'd never use them with that kind of record."
"In less than 48 hours I received an email from Ecruisestore, indicating they had traced down the mistake in their billing of my credit card and were already in contact with American Express. To me this is a perfectly professional response (and time frame). I assume the matter will now be routinely resolved. It may be that Ecruisestore has some issues in its billing department. Before this incident, however, I had not encountered errors by them."
"So glad they corrected the error once you pointed it out, but what if you hadn't pointed it out? Why did they make it in the first place and doesn't it seem wierd that they have made the same kind of ""error"" with other customers several times in the past? I wonder if there are customers out there who get double billed but don't point it out, which means somebody gets extra money. I wonder who. Just the fact that there seems to be a few people in this limited formum who have experienced the same ""error"" is enough for me to be a little suspicious and steer clear."
"I agree. It is a concern. On the other hand, I saved hundreds of dollars on an expensive Panama canal cruise, so it may be worth the risk.In the future, if I have a competing bid which is close, I would also avoid Ecruisestore. If theirs is still quite a bit less, I would purchase the cruise from them. It is hard to miss a multi-thousand dollar mistake on a credit card."
"Oh gosh, having seen first hand the incredible frustration and logistics involved in trying to fix my friends situation with them (unanswered phone calls,promises of fixes that never happen,blaming other for mistakes,excuses,excuses,excuses,etc), I would glady spend extra dollars to insure this sort of nonsense never happens to me. As such, I fortunately found an online agency (thru CCompete) and a sharp agent who answers all my questions, immediately responds to my phone calls and offers me competitive pricing without a glitch. So, I booked two cruises with her and will go with her again this fall.  I simply don't mind a few extra bucks to avoid all the C.R.A.P. my poor friend has had to endure over the past six months and still not totally resolved. Plus, if any bid of theirs came in substantially lower than all other agencies, I'd be even more suspicious."
"You ask if anyone has any experience with double billing by Ecruisestore? Well we do. We finally got our money back, but only by getting Visa to reverse the charge for ""services not rendered"". Ecruisestore are a bunch of criminals. No way around it. What company constantly double bills people by genuine mistake? This is no mistake, I'd be pretty confident that they have cash flow issues and this is their way of keeping the money flowing. Robbing Peter to pay Paul if you like.To the management at CruiseCompete if you are reading this. Please ditch this company before your reputation goes down the toilet with theirs. How much evidence do you need of this sort of unethical practise?Regards "
"Well, another customer screwed by them, and amen to the suggestion that CruiseCompete take some action, it is totally incumbent upon them to do something as these incidents can no longer be considered isolated or coincidental. It appears to be a deliberate practice on their part.  My friend who has been going thru hell with them for over six months has now filed a formal complaint with the Florida Attorney General, whatever good that may do, I dont know. Now that the travel industry and cruising is in the dumps it will be interesting how this shakes out."
"Hello Bob Levinson,Thank You for taking a moment to address my post even if it is a year later. I have never had any problems with cruisecompete.com up until the point I booked through ecruisestore. I think your company provides a valuable service and I do not hesitate to recommend it to many of my friends and family.""Hoopefloop: Yes, the agent, a new hire, flubbed this one by booking the wrong flights--no question about it. It was a definite screw-up. (The agent ""left"" eCruiseStore shortly after the incident.) The accounting manager recalls that an extra shipboard credit was issued with the agency's apologies to help make up for the error, but she's not 100% sure about it as it was quite a while ago (please correct me if that's wrong, Hoopefloop).""This incorrect. As part of the original package I booked there was supposed to be an on board credit issued. They did not issue an extra credit to make up for the problems. On top of that there was no on board credit at all when I arrived on the ship. As I state in my post after progressively less friendly emails I finally just requested they send the balance of the credit I should have received to my home. They agreed but never sent me anything and decided to ignore any further requests for status.Please do not be confused or be mislead as to the business practices of this ""agency"" I stand by my original statement that this is the SHADIEST ""agency"" I have ever dealt with. You of all people are aware of the previous incarnations of this business and the problems it had with customer service and satisfaction. After a few conversations with your own employees they let it slip some of the bad stories they had heard about this company and its owner.I have booked 14 cruises in the last 5 years and although I no longer use cruisecompete.com due to this experience I am still quick to recommend your service to others with the caveat not to use ecruisestore if they offer the best price.Finally, unless they have recently changed their policies they most certainly DO try to charge you cancellation fees. As I stated in my original post if I could have cxl'd without paying them a fee I WOULD HAVE!!! But why would I pay them 10% of my $5000+ trip for screwing up. They WOULD NOT I repeat WOULD NOT waive their cxl fees when I had my problems with them.All i can hope is my posts on the various sites have cost them more business than the obligation they did not live up to."
"Today by email I contacted Mr Levinson of CruiseCompete regarding my friends nightmare with this agency. He immediately contacted the agency and had them contact my friend immediately which they did however, again, their version of what has transpired was totally false.  They said Discover approved a credit when in fact we have written documentation that Discover denied it. This agency, thru it's reprentative, flat out lied when they needed to cover themselves. It is understandable that they act swiftly when CruiseCompete enters the picture however otherwise it is a horrible experience dealing with their double-talk, deception, dishonesty, sleezy business practices and outright lies. We can prove all of these allegations. I will continue to utilize CruiseCompete, I consider them honest and reputible and am impressed by Mr Levinsons genuine concern, but will never even consider a quote from this horrible agency. We will now proceed to file a formal complaint with C.L.I.A. as well."
"I too contacted Mr. Levinstein @ cruisecompete recently and have been pleasently surprised by his direct action on my behalf. I would like to commend Mr. Levinstein for standing behind his business and attempting to make things right so long after the incident. As terrible as it might sound to some, I am content to try and help other cruise lovers AVOID the unpleasant experience the ""unfortunate few"" have had with Ecruisestore.com. Happy cruising to allhooperfloop"
"Gee, I'm constantly amazed at what a coincidence it is that so many people have experienced the same unfortunate billing problems with this agency. One after another it seems. So glad its not an epidemic occurance. Thank goodness for Bob @ CC."
"Like many other posters here, I found that the ecruise agent was fantastic. But this company's accounting and billing department is either incompetent or a roomful of crooks. I booked several cruises through them, having found them through CruiseCompete. They offered an onboard credit that was very nice, and their agent was very communicative and knowledgeable. But like others, I found that they made repeated erroneous billings to my credit card. One was for $1,600 and bore no resemblance to any charge I'd made. Making ecruise.com reverse those errors was very difficult. In one case I literally threatened to take this case to the local state attorney's office for consideration of criminal complaints, after they promised to fix it repeatedly but the problem dragged on for more than 60 days after I discovered it. I honestly don't know if they are dolts, testing out my vigilance of my credit card charges, or just want the benefit of a short-term loan to cover a cash flow problem. Whatever it is, the motto of the agency should be Caveat Emptor.We finally gave up on them when in our last booking, they offered no benefit whatsoever. I booked with them foolishly assuming they would offer an on-board credit that was based on a portion of the total ticket for the cruise, as they had in the past. But the agent said that since I was using a coupon to reduce the price of the cabin, they would not be giving me any credit or benefit at all. I could have just as easily booked with the cruise company directly, or any other travel agent.Therefore, you could do well with this company, but you will have to scour your credit card bill for months to come after you give them your number. "
I want to fix my agency references and make that ecruisestore.com. I have no knowledge of an agency called ecruise.com
"Hi everyone,For what it's worth, we've had TWO problems with eCruiseStore. We found them from CruiseCompete, and seeing they were highly rated, decided to book.In March, 2008 we booked a Christmas cruise with them. We were charged correctly by Royal Caribbean for the cruise. However, in May, 2008 we were charged AGAIN by eCruiseStore. They claimed it was a ""problem due to a computer upgrade"" and would refund it, but we never received the refund and they would not return our phone calls. Finally, after disputing the charge, in July we received the actual refund.In November, they contacted us advising we could be upgraded for $200, we agreed. However, we were instead charged $2000 by Royal Caribbean. We contacted eCruiseStore immediately, they said it would be refunded shortly. We received two small refunds on our CC from Royal Caribbean, but there was still $1290 outstanding. In January, they said Royal Caribbean sent THEM a check, and they would forward it along... never received. In late January we filed a BBB complaint, and in February we received a response with a photocopy of a check they were sending us. Guess what... the check never made it. Based on my experience with them, I suspect they never sent it at all! It's March now and I still haven't received a refund, Royal Caribbean won't discuss the issue with me, and eCruiseStore won't return my phone calls. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card company, we'll see where that goes.By the way, regarding CruiseCompete, I would LOVE to post negative feedback about eCruiseStore, but at this point I can't figure out how! Maybe that's why they don't have any issues!The eCruiseStore agents are great. But their accounting and customer service departments seem to be a bunch of crooks and liars, and someone needs to hold them accountable.Needless to say, we won't be using eCruiseStore any more, or using CruiseCompete to book travel. Tim"
"Me again. My friend started being double/triple charged back in May 2008 and it's still unresolved, even with Bob Levenstein of CruiseCompete's interventions.  They also sent a ""copy"" of a check they cut and claim they sent her, but it was not made out to her but a passenger and supposidly mailed to the passengers address with the state typed as ""PA"" when the address is in ""CA"". Nobody ever received the check. Shock. ecruisestore says they are issuing a new check. Poor CruiseCompete is between a rock and a hard place with them and can only go so far (brief emails to them). My friend has filed a complaint with BBB (ecruise store does not belong) and the Fl. Attorney General but doesn't expect much from that. Next is CLIA. I am waiting any day now to hear they have folded. P.S. She was also promised a $50 cabin credit when this mess all began; needless to say that never happened either. Fraudulant activity all around."
"I wrote to this board back in late December when I had not received verification from RCCL that ECruiseStore had paid them although we paid them in full several months prior. To summarize our experience:1. We did not receive verification that they paid RCCL for all three legs of our cruise until about five days before we were due to sail. Others in our group that booked directly or used other agents had verification a month before the cruise date.2. We also were double charged early in the process. Took about three months to get it reversed and only when I asked my bank for assistance. My opinion is that they do it on purpose for cash flow.3. We were promised a $50 OBC for the double charge. We were told it would be on Leg 1. It was not - sorry. Will be on Leg 2. Not on Leg 2 - sorry we did not get it processed on time. We did get it on Leg 3. Again think they are holding on to cssh until last minute. Also because I kept emailing them about it.4. The RCCL fuel charge should have been subtracted from our final payment and given to us as OBC. No, ECruiseStore said they had paid it to RCCL in error and would have to wait for a check from RCCL before they sent it to us. Not sure if this is true or not. Again, I suspect that RCCL did remove it from final payment but ECruiseStore was holding on to the cash. They did send us a check for the amount and so far it has not bounced.Bottom line is that I did get the OBCs promised and did get back my fuel surcharge. But it took constant emailing on my part. Other thing to consider is that once you make payment they will not honor any cruise discounts unless you pay a penalty. Had I booked directly with RCCL I would have gotten the discounts and saved more money.So other than paying more for my cruise than if I had booked direct I did get what I was promised from ECruiseStore but it took a lot of follow-up on my part. We found them through CruiseCompete and I did write to Bob Levinson when I started having issues. He did respond to me saying he had contacted them. From another post here on TA found where he had responded on behalf of another client and got name of supervisor (which I think is co-owner) and started emailing directly to her. It was only then that I got some action. And to her credit she did deliver but took several emails and follow up on my part."
Bottom line: Even if they came in half the price of any other agency I wouldn't go near them. NOT FOR ANY AMOUNT PERIOD. What a total scam.
"My Ecruisestore Experience- Found Through Cruise Compete- I paid in full over a year in advance giving them  my money to invest, UGH!- I was double billed 2 successive months and had to resolve through Amex dispute department- Payment to Cruiseline more than 2 weeks past due  date and finally made 11th hour 59th minute after  I had to ask cruise line to extend.- Told by agent she has nothing to do with payment,  to call customer service. Many attempts made just  to call get voicemail. One time they had in the recording they were closed for a party ALL DAY!!!!- Told by agent they could not change cabin, they do no have time for things like that. Agent has a bad attitude and I felt like was I totally being brushed off if I asked questions. I guess  customers asking questions is not welcomed. So I started asking the cruise line directly. I got a very not so nice phone call that cruise line called them in regards to me calling them  and they she not appreciate that. - When I had asked agent about late payment, she  said ""don't worry, it will be made and you will have documents at least 14 days before sailing""-And guess what ... 6 days before I leave and NO DOCUMENTS! No surprise to me.- The cruise line says they had been mailed over a month ago to some other name ""uniglobe"" in CA, Ecruisestore claims to be in FL. - I will never book with them again and advise folks to avoid them and save themself the frustration and unpleasant experience    "
"And another name to the ecruisestore dot com horror list. Now that it is approaching 9 months since booking and cruise was over in Nov, finally got the double billing refund check it took forever to sqeeze out of them and would still not have gotten had it not been thru intervention of CruiseCompete. They finally send the check they said they had sent several weeks before that never came. Scam. Cashed the check for greenbacks at once. This agency is frightening."
"Dear Aussie Travellers,I booked a cruise with e-cruise store in 2008 and due to an emergency, I had to cancel the cruise that was set for December of 08. I was told it would take up to 12 weeks to get my refund. After 16 week and still no refund and battling with them daily, I went to Florida looking for the e-cruise store. I went to 3 listed addresses to find nothing more than a UPS Mail box and infomation that they had moved with no forwarding address. I can never get anyone in Customer Service to retur my calls and only get e-mails with no name attached with more lies about the check. As of today, I have a partial refund after being told lies for 4 months that a check was in the mail. JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. I would not recommed this company to anyone. It is a scam waiting to happen. Go Luck,"
"Glimpsed at my email messages just now and the word ""ecruisestore"" popped out at me.I screamed so loud my house shook.Looked closer and found it was just thisforum posting another horror story regardingthis horrible agency. Phew. Feel sorry forthe poor suckers out there booking as we speak only to find out later about the horror."
"I booked a cruise in Oct with them for 9 days out of Norfolk,I will not ever use them again. My TA booked me in a group without telling me and when the rate reduced I was stuck with the higher rate. The billing department double charged my cc, it was straighten fairly quickly. I just find it strange this is a common problem with them. I upgraded my room and the rate was so much higher than if I had booked with RC directly. "
"(Note: I felt it necessary to register a new screen name in order to post this information as my regular screen name would be recognizeable to this agency (same as my email address). They have my credit card number on file, so I'm exercising precaution here with a new screen name.) Like many others, I found eCruisestore.com via CruiseCompete.com. I booked a fairly high-priced cruise through them (I'm not talking a $399 sailing) about a month ago. Being an avid cruiser, everything clicked along normally and my credit card was properly charged by the cruise line, not eCruiseStore.com. A few weeks later I received an email from their Customer Service Dept (not the actual TA I had booked the cruise with) offering a 10% reduction in my fare, plus additional shipboard credits, if I could pay with MasterCard or Visa by the end of that week. According to an email, it was a special ""promotion"" they were running. At this point, my final payment due to the cruise line was several months in the future. I became suspicious of the offer for a number of reasons.1. The shipboard credits they were offering in addition to this additional 10% off represented approximately 30% of the total cruise fare. I doubted this agency gets paid 30% (or higher) commission from the cruise line. 2. The cruise line I was sailing offers their own discount for full payment 6 months in advance. When I replied to eCruiseStore's offer asking if their 10% discount would be combineable with the cruise line's discount, they answered ""no"". This is when I became suspicious that they would not be calling my credit card number into the cruise line for final payment, but rather running it through their own agency for ""cash flow"" purposes. At this point I searched the Internet for customer feedback on this agency and found this thread on TripAdvisor. Obviously, this thread confirmed my suspicions. In addition, I emailed CruiseCompete with my suspecions, and they quickly replied back, saying ""you have a clear picture of what's going on over there"". That was enough for me. I cancelled with eCruiseStore.com and booked with a reputable agent, one who processes all payments through the cruise lines. Thanks to this thread for opening my eyes and not going any further with eCruiseStore.com and becoming another victim of paying in full, yet only being in a ""on deposit"" status with the cruise line. To those who have had good luck with this agency, here is my assessment;If you book close to final payment time, your booking may be processed properly. In other words, they don't have that much time for a ""cash float"" of your money. Also, if you book a fairly inexpensive cruise with them, say under $1000 per person, there is probably not much incentive for them to offer you the ""deal"" I was offered. In my case, it was an expensive cruise, far off into the future, therefore a large chunk of money to be able to ""float"". Lastly, read your invoice very closely. It very clearly states that some charges to your credit card may appear as eCruiseStore.com (or Uniglobe, of which they are apparently an affiliate). That is a BIG RED FLAG that they may process your payment ""in house"" rather than through the cruise line. Never ever allow your cruise line payments to be processed by anyone but the cruise line. Good luck and be advised! "
"You are indeed one of the very lucky in that you caught on to these sleezy people before you really got taken and that they didn't run your credit card thru a few extra times with totally bogus charges obviously to keep their float going like they did to so many others. They continue to be a star performer on Cruise Complete so you will get platitudes and cheering on from CC but they can't afford to dump them either, so it's a game of the innocent getting stung and then people like you who do their homwork and become extremely suspicious when offered a free lunch. Again, you really lucked out because it obviouly could have been a lot, lot worse. If I were you, I would immediately cancel the credit card I used with them because as far as that goes....well, you can't be too sure...."
"I join with others who have made postings on this thread recommendating that eCruisestore be avoided no matter how much of a fare discount they may offer. I experienced improper charging of my credit card and failure of eCruisestore to pay the cruise line until very shortly before the departure date even though they had my money for many months. I became convinced that they had serious financial problems and I was doubtful that the cruise line was going to be paid. After innumerable emails and phone calls everything turned out OK, but the discount I receved was certainly not worth the agony of dealing with those people. "
"I recently booked a 8-day Eastern Caribbean cruise through ecruisestore.com and dealt with RC Tanner. He told me that he had 19 years experience in the business and I believe it. Mr. Tanner was exceptional in handling our booking which was fairly messy to begin with...that is, I had my wife, my baby daughter, and my two senior citizen in-laws. Mr. Tanner was able to identify my needs, concerns and actually took my fears around scheduling, logistics, etc. and provided me with a balcony room with a crib and he got my in-laws traded to a room 7 floors away to a room that was in the same section as ours. This made it a whole easier to have the in-laws stop by and take care of our baby on a regular basis. Further, it allowed us to completely relax and enjoy our vacation. It's difficult to find someone who has 19 years in any business and I am lucky to have found RC Tanner to help me with my vacation needs. I recommend you contact him as you cannot go wrong with your cruise vacation booking. The prices were on par with what others were offering and much lower than booking directly through the cruise line. His services were exceptional. "
"I am glad Chiltoni you had such a good experience with ecruisestore. I don't think Mr. Tanner is the trouble with this place, I think it's the management. Since there are 6 pages so far on this formun regarding their practices, It is obvious that many have indeed gone wrong booking with them. Their history of shady charges evidenced here is undeniable."
"My orginal experience with Ecruisestore was okay, but as I got closer to my cruise my cc was hit again, when I wanted to upgrade from an OV to balcony was overcharged by 450.00, so this is why we have an issue with them. When I called my TA and asked about the overcharge was told she was not going to deal with it. "
"My experience with the travel agent was great. She wasn't the problem. In fact, if she were to move to another agency I might follow her there.The problem, as everyone else has written, was that the business office repeatedly charged my credit card large sums and then was slow in correcting those mistakes. I stayed with eCruisestore.com way too long because of the travel agent.I'm surprised agents so good stay with a place so bad. Perhaps they're paid well above the standard in order to keep customers who will tolerate these ridiculous phony charges. "
"Avoid ecruise store !I've reserved with them a transat QM2 cruise (may 2009).I gave my AMEX credit card number and authorize them to charge it for a deposit reservation.One month later I noticed they had charged the full amount.One month later again, I noticed they had charged the full amount a second time.They apologized but declared they were unable to pay me back and advise me to dispute the payment.So did I and I got the refund from AMEX 3 months later only.I was given ""shipboard credit"" as a compensation for these inconveniencies.When I came aboard, Cunard didn' have got any information about this credit...I thought I was only ""unlucky"" till I noticed other customers comments showing that it's not at all a matter of chance but something ""systemic"" to get cash from the customer.So avoid them !Claude DEFAWE "
"What you have just posted is exactly the same thing that they have been doing to the countless suckers posted here and imagine how many have suffered from these crooks who don't see this forum. Go to Better Business Bureau: They get a ""D"" rating. "
Why do posters keep saying that the individual TA'a aren't the problem? They KNOW what the company is doing.They are a big part of the con. As is Cruisecompete.
"TA's can't bite the hand that feeds them and they have to self-promote. Even complaining to Cruise Critic is in vain as this agency still remains a big client of theirs too. Hand's tied all around when it all comes down to moolah. Only way you can protect yourself is search BBB and make sure the agency is accessible by phone or address on their web site. Lacking that, it's a total crap shoot."
i dont know why people dont just deal with company's website directly. its cheaper. unless its like part of a whole package deal like with air+hotel. if i wanted a cruise il just go to carnival's website or royal caribean's site etc...
"Well, what good is an address or phone number if their automated responses are ""always on"". Had a Heck of a time dealing with them from June '08 until weleft on our cruise on Jan. 4, 2009. They never paidfor our cruise until 4 days prior to departure whenit was due to RCCL back in Oct. and Nov. (we did a B2B). To add insult to injury, when we returned -- saw an additional payment of $ 900 on my cc statement. When I called RCCL about tHis --- was informed that ECrUiseStore had sent the chaRge through. WHen I called the agent about tnis --- wastold some crap that theIR accounting dept. made an error in fORwarding my payments to RCCL and that I still had a balance due the cruise line. I pointed out that I had PAID IN FULL per the agency's invoice on June 10, 2008 and it was NOT my responsibility to pay any additonal money. If they made the error -- they needed to make it good with THEIR money NOT MINE ! Went to my cc company todispute the payment only to find out 2 months later,that since I had paid for the trip 6 months prior todeparture ---- nothing could be done. Well, we willjust see about this ---- have just been reading about another poor victum on the CruiseCritic site and gotten some great suggestions on how to pursue thisAGAIN !!!! Bottom line ---- DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS AGENCY NO MATTER WHAT THEY OFFER YOU !!"
Because they are normally quite a bit more expensive!
"Well, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. I read about this travel agency on Cruise Critic's Holland America bulletin boards and I have to say, I am appalled these people are still allowed to operate. I tried Cruise Compete once a long while ago based upon a fellow cruiser's recommendation. While the price was ""decent""; the peace of mind I have booking through my regular TA is worth so much more.If ANY agency ever double billed me, ran my credit card as a direct payment to their agency, made ""mystery"" unauthorized charges, or did not have my official cruise documents IN MY HAND 30 days prior ro sailing; I would: 1. Complain each and every day - maybe every hour; 2. Never, ever use them (or the booking agent - in this case Cruise Compete); 3. Sue them.There is no excuse for this! In this day and age, and especially this econmy, it is FAR, FAR better to go with what you know than to take a chance on saving a few dollars and ultimately take a chance getting ripped off."
"You can complain til blue in the face and they just lie or put you thru to voice mail. Of course not doing business with them again is obvious. If you sue them, the legal fees would eat the both of you up, they would go under and you'd get zip, then they would move down the street and start up under another name and start the scam all over again and end up with another D or D+ with the BBB. Rotten, rotten, rotten."
"I am so sorry to hear of all the stories connected with ecruisestore. My story has a little different twist. My charge card was charged three times for the same cruise, once by ecruisestore, the second by Galaxy Cruise and Travel (which is the same entity by the way), and the third charge was by Princess (the legitimate charge). These charges occurred over a timespan of 5 months. The first overcharge was resolved by my charge card within four months. It took 9 months to resolve the second overcharge, finally in June 09. I have a VERY thick file with all the e-mails, correspondence, etc. I consider myself very lucky as each charge was over $3000.I was very trusting at first and believed the agency when they politely said they would fix everything. They did not. They promised me onboard credit, but when I boarded the ship, no credit had been applied. I phoned the agency from the ship before departure and indeed they did give me the onboard credit, but not do so until I called the day of our sailing.Contacting Mr. Levenstein at Cruise Compete is helpful. Working with my charge card company was very arduous, but eventually they pursued the situation. They could not understand that ecruisestore and Galaxy Cruise and Travel were the same entity.Also, be sure to document every date, time, name of person spoken to, supervisor badge number (I finally only talked to supervisors at the charge card company), etc. that you talked with your charge card and the angency.I wish you all good luck with resolving the situation. "
"What can I say WRITEFREE? Your horror story beats them all, even my friend who was only overcharged twice and took nearly 7 months to clear up. Why doesn't the Fla Attorney General shut these scam artists down?"
"I've spent a lot of time reading about this agent on CC (unnamed there of course) and here and it is unbelievable that this agent is still allowed to operate. So we, as wise consumers, have to take the wheel. In this age of Ponzi schemes and Bernie Madoffs the consumer is far more aware than we once were. This agency is playing with everyone's money, discounting if you pay up front so they can hold and use your money until final payment and hopefully have some other victim in line to pay that and so forth.Easy to fix on our end. Whatever agent we use, we insist that the transaction go thru the Cruise Line. I did this with another agent who likes to have the transaction go through them and then send the money to the cruise line for the ""whole group"" (even though I didn't think I had booked a group cruise). Watch your charges on the internet and make sure it shows the cruise line's name. If so, you're set ... no problem. If not, you don't pay the bill, challenge the charge, cancel the cruise with that agent and go from there.At the end of the day, all we have is ourselves. Clearly we can't trust anyone to watch out for us because these thieves are still doing business. Holland America told a CC member they were no longer working with them, but they evidently are.So ... ball's in our court."
"Good advice to deal with the scumbags, but shouldn't the Fla A.G. be doing something about them. My friend lodged a formal complaint but since it is a government agency, is it odd to see nothing happen? "
"RUN AWAY as fast as you can!Do not do business with this so called company.Cruiselines give you the best ""sleep at night service"". What I mean is that if you book directly with them...you know your money and your cruise will be safe.Believe me..you will be able to sleep much better at night...not worrying about if your money was paid ..or not.Join cruisecritic.com and read what others have gone through.Good luck."
"I have to pop over to CCritic, didn't know they had a e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-kcruisestore.con rant going over there too. Again, where are the authorities?"
"OMG, I am panicked! Just booked a Celebrity cruise and decided to ""pay in full"" for the additional OBC. My VISA has the deposit charged to the cruiseline, but the rest of the amount is to ECruise. I am going to call VISA today, and Ecruise store to tell them I decided against the extra OBC. I will see what happends.What really makes me feel badly is that 2 other couples, traveling with us, did the same based on my recommendation to book with ecruise."
Here is the Better Business report link:www.orlando.bbb.org/newsearch2.asp…
My EXTREMELY STONG ADVISE: CANCEL these reservationsIMMEDIATELY --- contact your credit cards and tellthem what you have learned. Book with another REPUTABLE agency --- It's NOT TOO late -- even ifyou lose a little $$$ now - it's NOTHING compared to the stress and aggravation you are in for with thisVERY disreputable agency. All the reports on thissite MUST tell you something !!
"This post if forBob Levinstein, CEO of CruiseCompete.comRichard Tanner, Ecruisestore.comand has been forwarded to their emails.Can both of you please comment on the systematic double billing of clients by ecruisestore.comas outlined in tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g34438-i92-k137435…"
"From eCruisestore itself you will receive excuses, promises, friendly lies and outright deception and fraud. From CruiseCompete you will receive courteous response and vague promises to look into the matter. Bottom line: Neither the cruise lines nor CruiseCompete will do anything to stop these people because ecruise continues to generate income for them. Where is the Attorney General of the State of Florida? For you who booked, GET OUT NOW, the headaches you will go thru if they pull their scam on you or your friends will drive you nuts."
"I called the cruiseline and, very interestingly, learned that our cruise was not booked by ecruise, but another travel agency. This agency will receive a phone call from me tomorrow re: the shady practices of ecruise. The ""agent of record's"" website indicates a reputable business since 1988. My suspicion is that the booking was done this way because the cruiseline has blackballed ecruise!"
"Follow this link to more complaints and their ""other"" travel agency:www.disboards.com/showthread.php?t=2245433and another:www.fodors.com/world/restaurant-reviews.htmlThese scheisters are all over the place with complaints now, I think they get a kick out of it."
"I think you are 100% right! That makes perfect sense since I know Holland America Line says they're no longer using ECruiseStore.Anyone who wants more info about this TA should visit the Cruise Critic HAL board and read the experience of one of our members there. The title of the thread is ""Agency Issue"" and it's on the Holland America forum."
"on what page of the CruiseCritic HA forum you mention is the name of the ""agency"" revealed. There are 24 pages. Also I notice that ecruisestore's web site still shows Holland America Line as one of their top providers. The plot thickens."
"The name of the agency isn't revealed on CC because that's against their policy guidelines. In fact, the thread has been closed. But it is the same agency and that was confirmed by the original poster (in a discreet way). I can't remember which page."
Here's a link to the thread on CruiseCritic:boards.cruisecritic.com/showthread.php…
We have used cruisecompete several times without problem until we bought a cruise through ecruisestore.com (R Tanner)It appears that they often double charge credit cards under their name or Galaxy Travel / Cruises instead of getting the cruise line to charge.The above is from a post on disboards.com in the forums there. There is a link in an above post directly to the entire post. 
"I am sorry to admit that I am another ""sucker"" who has been taken in by ECruise Store.I booked a cruise for July 2010 giving my credit card for the deposit. It was charged by the cruise line. No problems there. Then a month later the deposit was charged again by an organisation called Galaxy Cruises. I was on to them like a flash and received an e,mail to say that ""After some research we found that your credit card had been charged in error'.They indicated the credit would come through in around 7 days and offered to refund me any out of pocket costs,like interst etc. That was two weeks ago.I was on to them yesterday. They said the credit card was processed on the 4th August and as they have an independant processor they use, it usually takes around 14 days to reach the customers account.The bad news is that I agreed to take up their 10% discount offer and $250.00 worth of OBC.for prompt payment. I assumed that the early payment discount was in conjunction with the cruise company and assumed my card would be debited by the cruise line however as everyone knew except me the travel agent holds the cash and is meant to pay 75 days prior to travel.I only became suspicious about this organisation after the double charge so you can imagine my horror when I came to this site and found over 80 posts with only two being supportive.Now my dilemma is,Should I cancel or ride with it. According to my invoice it says ""No cancellation Penalties until 76 days Prior to Sailing "" Will they charge any cancellation fees. Then there is the problem of further charges to my card,etc,etc.Any thoughts.As a matter of interest this cruise did not show up on the Cruise Compete website but there is a spot where you can insert the cruise date and Cruise Compete indicates they will get back to you. The contact then was from Richard Tanner at Ecruise Store so Cruise Compete had given Ecruise my enquiry directly."
"Dear Kiwitraveler34,Since your cruise is one year away, I would cancel with eCruiseStore and rebook through the cruise line or a reputable Travel Agent. eCruisestore.com is notorious for making slick offers to people who book far in advance as you have. The problem of course is that they don't call in your credit card to the cruise line for processing, but rather run it through their own agency (for obvious cash flow reasons). When it comes final payment time, they often delay paying the cruise line, leaving you in jeopardy. Please read the link to the Cruise Critic thread in post #81 of this thread. It is a 30+ thread of a poor woman who paid a year in advance for her 64-day cruise. eCruisestore didn't not send her payment to Holland America and a nightmare ensued. Unless you cancel your cruise with eCruisestore.com and rebook with someone else, you could be victim of the same scam. You can only challenge a credit card payment for generally 60 days from the transaction date. If you wait until your final payment is due to the cruise line in 2010, it will be too late for your credit card company do to anything about it. Good luck and keep us posted.I have sent a message to Bob Levinstein, CEO of Cruise Compete for him to confirm or deny if Cruise Compete still does business with eCruisestore.com. Hopefully, they don't. At any rate, I believe Mr Levinstein owes this thread an update from his early post in Sept 2008. Take the high road, Mr Levinstein! "
Get the hell out now.  
A month ago I posted a cruise request on Cruise Compete and one of the bidders was ecruisecorruptstore.com so looks like they're still selling their junk on CC.
"That's too bad eCruisestore.com is still affiliated with CruiseCompete.com. While reading the 30+ page thread on Cruise Critic (link a few posts up), it was noted that Holland America will no longer deal with eCruisestore.com due to all the problems mentioned here on Tripadvisor. CruiseCompete.com should not allow eCruisestore.com to tarnish their otherwise good reputation. "
Thanks for input. I read the thread on Cruise Critic about the poor lady and did not realise it was the same T/A I am going to cancel and no doubt will have a long delay in getting refunded.I have booked two previous cruises through Cruise Compete and they have been OK however the T/A i dealt with has left the company so I decided to go with the contact Cruise Compete supplied.Will keep you up to date on progress.Seaalot has sent me personal message but I cannot seem to open it. Call me on 473 5396.
"I e,mailed my cancellation to Ecruise last night and received a reply saying they will refund me all of the amount I have paid them directly. They say that they will have it credited in 4 to 5 weeks.Hope that will be the case.My deposit is still with Princess. I still want to go on the cruise. Can you advise the cruise line that you have changed your travel agent or even deal direct."
"I have booked three totally flawless cruises with a large A+ BBB online agency and absolutely fantastic lady who treats me royally. Since I am not suppose to solicit or advertise here, email me and I'll be glad to introduce you.P.S. Despite posting here that Holland America no longer uses ecruisestore, the ecruisestore web site is still advertising and promoting their cruises."
"You can go over to Fodors.com, they even have forum rants about these scam artsist as well as Cruise Critic."
E-CRUISE STORE has changed their name to:CRUISE PLANNERS/ GREAT VACATIONS. The agent mentiones so much on cruise critic is using a similar name.BEWARE !! I would aslo be concerned with doing business with cruise compete. 
Cruise Compete is between a rock and a hard place since there is an entire population out there completely unaware of ECS. CC can not bite the hand that feeds them. Does the State of Florida have a mechanism to investigate businesses which seem to be constantly engaging in suspiciously mischevious if not fraudulant behavior?
I just foumd out that E_CRUISE STORE is still out there bidding on cruise compete. I was quoted the exact price from both agents. Seems they are working under at least 2 names.BEWARE!!!
"I am not sure how anyone would get overcharged by this TA if they were using cruisecompete.com since you get quotes from at least four or more agents. I have used Cruises-n-More now two times and have found them to be the lowest or equal to other agents that quote thru cruisecompete.com. C-N-M is also an American Express agent and they always have the deposit and final payment going thru the cruiseline and not to them. I guess you just have to be careful when you are doing things online because bad things can happen with any transaction, whether it be for a cruise or something you might purchase."
"I know that cruises-n-more is an excellent TA in Lake Mary, I have booked with them several times, the deposit and final payment is processed by the cruise line. I have no problem using them.I used cruisecompete several days ago, the the agent from cruise planner/great vacation also gave me a quote with big OBC! Their address list as 4044 W. Lake Mary Blvd, Lake mary, Florida."
"Convert, I am replying to you only since I am new to this site and have observed how diligently you are fighting these crooks.I am a long time Cruise Critic poster and followed the entire Kween Karen saga with this criminal. I am glad that it is allowed to name names here.boards.cruisecritic.com/showthread.php…(for those that want to read it)If anyone, in spite of all these posts still insists on using ecruisestore or any of the R.C. Tanner clones, there is a way they can protect themselves from the infamous and customary, habitual double charges:(this is also good for any online purchases where you might be suspicious of the seller)Most credit card companies have an option of ""Single Use"" Card Numbers called ""Shop Safe"" or some other plan name. Basically they issue a unique credit card number for a particular purchase and you set the limit as to how much $$$ can be charged to this number. You just contact or go online with your credit card company and let them know you are going to purchase something for XXX dollars and you get a unique credit card number that is only good for that amount.This is a VERY simple process online.If a corrupt TA (or any other merchant) tries to over charge or double charge they will get NOTHING ! And these criminals will never complain since it would uncover their attempt at fraud.Hope this is of some use to any of you."
"Mr. Levinson,IF you are the honest human being and responsible businessman that you profess to be; PAY CLOSE ATTENTION:1. You can't choose your family, but you can choose your associates. So, unless Mr. R.C. Tanner is your Brother-In-Law, you CAN choose to NOT continue in business with him.2. You ARE known by the company you keep.3. Simple math decrees that you WANT CruiseCompete.com to be linked and forever associated with the reputation of eCruiseStore.com.If you lie down with dogs you WILL get up with fleas.Surely you have read all these posts and while some customers do distinguish between the two sites, ever more and more the two are linked into ONE impression.Your CHOICE: succeed on your own terms, with your values intact OR be thrown out with the trash.You only get one chance to make a first impression.Just what amount of $$$ from Mr. Tanner is worth your reputation and honor ?"
Never heard of it. I have booked direct with cruiseline in the past.
"When I checked their website today, Ecruisestore has a direct link to HAL & Celebrity. I followed the Celebrity Link and it does go directly to that cruiseline but indicates that the TA of record will be Ecruisestore.com.Verrrry Interesting.BTW, we requested in writing that our prepay be transferred directly to Celebrity and were told the process takes 3 weeks. I keep checking my cc to insure that no suspicious charges have shown up. So far so good. And I have 30 days to dispute the charge w/ the cc to the TA if my monies haven't been transferred by 8/26."
I have booked 10 cruises in over 4 years with RC Tanner at eCruiseStore and have never had a problem. I've asked him about these threads and it seems that it would be competitors posting bad notes about them so that they look bad. RC has always given me great prices and have always had a great experience with him. I have recommended friends to him as well and they've never had a problem with him either.
Why is it that all of the positive reviews of this cruise website come from 1st time posters here on TA??
Why is there negative postings for 1 time users as well? 
crzgal-I will be very happy if I can report the same positive experience you have had with this agency!Time will tell.....
"crzrgal of Houston, I am pleased that you have had such a great experience with ecruisestore. As for me, a retired teacher and not a travel agent competitor, I had a horrendous experience with ecruisestore/galaxy cruise and travel. Almost 11 months of waiting for the resolution with my charge card and the agency was a challenging experience for me. Not everyone is physically, emotionally, and financially able to handle overcharges of over $7000.I am amazed that there have been over 50 posts since I stated the facts about my experience. I doubt that the lady who had the issue with ecruisestore and posted her trials on the Cruise Critic/Holland America thread is a travel agent either."
Dear WriteFree: AMEN!
"Please read about my experience with this agency --- I believe it should be in the first 10 or 20 postings. This is not the first time that I havewarned potential new customers to NOT do businesswith these people. Their business tactics of offering generous OBC's by paying in full at the initial time of booking with your credit card isvery attractive bait to lure customers into their web. (And don't think that your credit card company will protect you --- you only have 60 days from purchase to dispute a charge --- and as this agencyis convincing people to pay months in advance fortheir trips --- they know the credit card companiescan't touch them for reimbursement). They put me through over 6 months of stressand aggravation prior to departure --- made an unauthorized charge to my cc without my permission --never paid RCCL for the balance of my cruise until5 days PRIOR to sailing even though the due dateswere at least 2 months prior to that. They also overcharged another couple in our group --- twice --which took months to straighten out. This agencyis obviously ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" with your money. I will never do business with them again, no matter how attractive the offers. In addition, theowner, RC Tanner, has done business under severaldifferent names and has over 25 litigations pendingagainst him. Personally, I think all the ""positive""comments on this subject are completely false postings. JMO "
25 letigations? PLEASE - I highly doubt that. As stated previously I have booked with him quite a few times and never had a problem. 
"Well, then -- you are either a personal friend of Mr. Tanner or have been EXTREMELY LUCKY. I do wonderwhy there are more people having ""negative"" comments and experiences with this agency rather than ""positive"". As I have stated previously - ""once burned - twice shy !!""JMO"
"Found him on Cruise Compete 4 years ago, never met him face to face as he is in Florida and I am in Texas. I trust him and like him. He's very well traveled and knows the business and gets me good deals."
"Another 1st time poster -- Why, because I checked out eCruiseStore posings AFTER I'd already been mistreated by them. I had used them due to good recommendation by CruiseCompete. Paid in full for September cruise during April 2009.Learned due to July MasterCard Statement Celebrity credit of $900 that my cabin reservation had been cancelled by Celebrity in July for non-payment. Travel Agent had not sent to Celebrity approximately t $6000 that eCuiseStore had directed to themselves in April.August 14, 2009: eCruiseStores charged an ADDITIONAL #3.751.52 against our MasterCharge.August 17, 2009: Found out from Celebrity that eCruiseStores had 2 additional reservations in my name, but NO money had been paid for either.August 18, 2009: Requested that eCruiseStores cancel all additional reservations in my name that they had made following the July cancellation by Celebrity.Requested refund of all $$$ eCruiseStores had charged against our MasterCard. Richard Tanner refused cash refund even though they had been holding almost $6,000 of our money since APRIL! and recently had charged an additional $3751.52.He agreed to credit our MasterCard. To date, we have not been notified by MasterCard of that occurrence. Sept. 2, 2009Note: there are theads re eCruiseStores poor business practice on CruiseCritic - Holland America, Celebrity, and Cunard. I sure do wish I'd checked eCruiseStores personally before I trusted them with our money."
"We too booked & prepaid first and found threads after. We are very fortunate that our booking with ecruisestore had been brokered to another agency which was the agency of record with the cruiseline. I contacted the agency of record who recommended that we ask ecruisestore to transfer our prepay immediately to the cruiseline. This was done this week and hopefully we will not encounter any difficulty with credit card overcharges. As a matter of fact, once I submit this comment, I'm going to check my MC charges online.I recommend to anyone who has booked with ecruise to contact the cruiseline immediately and learn what you can as well as inform them of your concerns. Some cruiseline personnel are reluctant to talk directly to the customer who has booked thru a TA, but be persistent or call back til you get a rep who listens to your concerns and provides you information about YOUR booking. "
"I am a late comer to this thread and I learned about it from CC.I have dealt with ecruisestore and RC Tanner in the past and got lucky - just barely.I pre paid a very expensive cruise (on Silversea) receiving the 10% discount. However, I was sweating bullets until 2 weeks before the cruise as the money had not been paid to Silversea. It ended well, but I learned my lesson.I had several other cruises booked with ecruisestore & RC (one pre-paid). I eventually received all of my pre-payment (after 6 months) and now all the bookings are with another agency.Learned a valuable lesson - all CC payments need to go to the cruise line and not the TA.I hope a lot of people read this and hopefully it will save them trouble in the future"
"We got a phone call from Princes today...Unfortunately we were not home. I am waiting for 7 AM california time to call them.We had the double charging....had MUCH trouble getting it fixed.We are now thinking from doing research that our final payment has not been made- and are concerned we have a place on our Oct 25ht cruise.I am reading too, where people do not get the obc that they were promised either. Looking into the Chamber of Commerce BBB and other places to complain to - depending on the outcome of final payment and some how I am going to make SURE we get the OBC we were promised."
Regarding OBC: Lots of luck. My friend was also promised OBC (after triplicate charges and finally restitution after 7 months). It never materialized once they got onboard. It's a come-on and nothing you can really do if it doesn't happen. So very sorry. Let us know on this forum what your final outcome is.
"Wouldn't touch this agency again with a 10-foot pole! We've been double charged and given the same excuse as previous writers. We are now 5 weeks from cruising and have been called by Princess Cruises only to be told that the final payment of our cruise was never made....and it was due 30 days ago! We made that final payment 10 months ago!!!?! The same situation is true for our cruising companions as well as with about 30 other Princess Cruises customers! Sounds a little like a Bernie Madoff scheme! Hummmm....perhaps Bernie will be having a new cellmate! Stay away from this agency! And, HAPPY CRUISING!!"
"I wish you good luck and hope it will work out OK.Please let us know of the outcome.Have you posted this on the Princess CC forum (as many of the affeted customers are from Princess)?That is a very active forum, visited by many people and this needs to be known by as many people as possible."
"Unfortunately CruiseCritic does NOT allow travel agenies and names to be made public -- which I thinkis TERRIBLE !!!! --- this agency should be put out of business but for all the good that would do -- RC Tanner or whoever the owner is would just open up under another name and contine their unethical business practices. Thank goodness for TripAdvisor - unfortunately, for me, I found this site too late."
It makes you wonder when will ALL the cruise lines stop accepting down payments from this agency to save all of us the subsequent headaches and disappointments?Ditto for cruisecompete!
"It might be a litle harder (though not impossible) for RC to make bookings from his prison cell - don't you agree?As far as CC goes, you should post it anyway - most people will figure out what TA it is when you reference HAL, Crystal or this thread."
"RE: posting on CruiseCritic.com Well, when I read about Kween Karen and the issues she was having with her TA and the unpaid balance of over $ 8000 that ECruiseStore had NOT paid --- Ireplied with some of my experience with this agency.Of course, I could not list their name but did givemy email address for folks to contact me, if interested. I received over 60 inquiries and thenCruiseCritic basically, ""slapped my hand"" as I wasnot suppose to give out my email address for that purpose. (I have been banned (limited time) on two different occasions for posting specific info about CruiseCompete.com and some tour operators stuff ----- soI am very cautious about what I do and do not post.I enjoy CC very much, have learned tons of info, and do NOT want to be banned permanently.)"
"Well, I did it.I posted it on the Princess CC thread. People need to know about this scam; the more people know, the fewer victims there will be."
"Glad you posted on CC, Mr. Pepper! And to anyone who has a booking with ecruise, be vigilant. Be aware that their invoice # is NOT your cruiseline reservation # and it's important to obtain that # to be sure you really are booked!"
"Neither CruiseCompete nor Princess is going to do anything drastic about this situation (i.e. cut them off from doing business). Bottom line is they are (eventually)receiving revenue from doing business with eCruisestore so they are not going to bite the hand that feeds them. In the cruise industry today, every cent counts, so don't look to them for any action against these culprits. The unsuspecting consumer is going to pay the price and obviously continue to be screwed. I wonder why the Florida authorities don't do something. They have been reported to the state Attorney General, but alas, I am talking about a government entity here, so maybe in a few years they might take a cursory look at them. Whatever. As always, buyer beware. Thank goodness I found an A+ agency and agent to do all my business with."
"I was told by the Princess Customer Service person in charge of calling all of us (she said she went home Thursday feeling TERRIBLE)---that Princess is NO longer doing business with the agency.They are, however, trying to make right those of us who have upcoming cruises- we have been told that our money is being wired Monday-- of course it WAS due 33 days ago!--- I have been in contact with the CEO of cruisecompete...will post more of that later.I did post on The princess site too.I have TRIED to get ahold of LauraS on CC to say we NEED to have the names of places like this posted to save others from what I am going thru this weekend!"
"ecruisestore.com web site still shows logo of Princess as one of their suppliers so either Princess forgot to tell ECS they are not, or ECS forgot to remove them from their site. Hmm. I don't think CruiseCompete can post a list of places that do this sort of thing (legal issues). It would be nice if CC removed ECS as a bidder tho. The CEO of CC is a nice person who listens, understands and sympathizes. But.  So, the nightmare continues because of the vermin who prey on unsuspecting, trusting consumers.  There aught to be a law. Oh."
"To Crzgal,I posted back in March or April about my dealings with RC Tanner. Like you, I had no problems specifically with him. My problems instead were with the accounting end of this agency due to all their shenanigans. I will repeat my opinion of eCruisestore.com is that if you book a fairly inexpensive cruise where final payment is due soon (60-90 days?) after you place a deposit, the chances are your booking will be handled without problems. It is the expensive, booked far in advance cruises ($10,000 - 18 months prior in my case) that get you into trouble with eCruisestore.com. By offering you an additional discount for early payment, they are able to run large amounts of money through their agency as a cash float for well over a year before your final payment is due to the cruise line. So, again, if you're booking a $799 cruise 90 days in advance and the final payment is due in just 30 days, chances are your booking will likely be handled properly. There is simply not enough time for them to enjoy a cash float compared to cruises booked 1-2 years in advance. Make sense?"
" This agency is corrupt and personally I simply do not want to take any chances what-so-ever with anyone, regardless of how large or small the money involved. There are so many wonderful agencies and excellent choices out there that I can't imagine doing business with someone who has been the subject of so many horror stories here and elsewhere. So, even tho my cruise may be costing under a grand, I sure am not going to dive in, fingers crossed and hope I don't get screwed. I'll book with confidence and peace of mind rather than with paranoia."
"convert94,ditto"
"Hi again lcds1. I contacted you earlier today on CC about RCT and ecruisestore. I posted a new thread and that was how i found you. Now I can't find the thread. did CC remove it because i used specific names? If you can find it, please let me know."
"To Convert94,Just so there's no misunderstanding, my post #127 was not meant to suggest in any way people taking lower fare cruises should be encouraged to do business with eCrusiestore.com. I, too, would avoid them at all costs regardless of the cost of the cruise. My post was to hopefully give explanation why some people have absolutely no problems dealing with this company, while others do. As far as I'm concerned, it's all about the cash float that determins if they are going to screw with you, or that your booking will be handled normally, without incident. "
Our cruise is a 10 day ..not terribly expensive.And we STILL had double charging....SUPPOSEDLY ourmoney was wired today= however it hasnt hit Princess yet as we are not allowed to print our boarding passes.Something needs to be done about this __________fill in the blank.
"LCDS1,How far in advance did you book your cruise? And did eCruisestore offer you an discount for early payment? "
"Here is an update on my posts #82,88 amd 89.I cancelled the cruise through ecruise store and as i mentioned in my previous post they said they would refund me in full. I also disputed the charges through my credit card company.So far i have had my original deposit refunded from the cruise line but nothing so far for the double charge by Galaxy cruises or my final payment. I have been in touch regularly with ecruise store and they have now advised me that as I have disputed the amount through my credit card company they will now go through with that process.Another stalling strategy i think.My credit card company promised action within 30 days and that time is nearing so will keep you up to date as to the outcome."
"Kiwitraveler,I had a very similar situation (going through CC dispute process, etc).Stay with it and keep after it. It will come through - don't give up."
"We booked last October 23 for this year Oct 25.Yes, we were ""given"" a 5% discount for paying in full on our Discover card."
"lcds1,Then your situation is more or less ""textbook"" for eCruisestore. They've had your money to float for 11 months now, and yet they're over 30 days late paying the cruise line for YOUR vacation. Complete SLIME."
"I paid for our Jan.2009 cruise on June 10, 2008 in full to take advantage of the additional 5% OBC's this agency offered using my cc. My credit card co.told me that there was nothing they could do to getthe extra $ 900 this agency charged to my cc on Dec. 29th back as it was more than 60 days past the originaldate of PAYMENT --- so when you actually take possessionof the merchandise (in my case, a cruise) is a mootpoint. My argument was that ""why can't you get mymoney back --- I hadn't even left my home to travelto Florida to take the darn trip yet --- therefore,no delivery of goods promised."" So, are you now telling me that I should still bug my cc companiesfor this money ???? I am really discouraged --- this has been going on for almost 9 months now.Sometimes you just get really tired and frustratedwith all the hassle !!!"
What credit card company are you dealing with?
"Bank of America - Celebrity Visa  "" "" - RCCL Visa"
"I just diverted a complete disaster with this company. I booked a cruise to hawaii with them in what seemed like an incredible deal. a few days later, my credit card red flagged the transaction because they tried to pay the entire booking along with the deposit. I had to change and cancel the card, and immediately called eCruisestore. They explained that they thought I had requested a deal that was offered when the balance was paid in full. I took it at the time as a misunderstanding and told them I would pay the balance right before the due date. As the due date arrived, I called them to make the final payment. I had to leave messages, as no one was answering the phone. I got messages and emails that I could call them with the final payment or email it to them, which of course, I would never do. Again, no answers on their phone, each time I tried.Finally, I got a call from Princess. They said they were having trouble collecting payment from ecruisestore. and I told them the problems I was have. They reccommended that I try to work something out with them because of the difference in the cost of the cruise if I made the final payment through princess-- I would lose the onboard credit and the bottle of wine promise by ecruisestore, plus the $700 price difference. I tried to reach them to no avail and finally just made the final payment through Princess.I too, had checked out the reviews on the company and all seemed good, but I would never recommend them to anyone!"
"I have a more balanced view than most of the ones I have read in this forum.We booked our cruise with RC Tanner at eCruisetore.com because he was the only travel agent who got us the cabins that we wanted on the Queen Mary 2 and gave us a great price. I paid in full using mastercard at the time of the booking to get an extra 5% discount.We did not receive our travel documentation from Cunard because the travel agent did not transfer the money to them on time. However, in the end we did not need the documentation and our booking was not affected.Two days before leaving for the cruise I found that my credit card had been charged an extra 6,200 dollars and complained to Bob Levinstein, the CEO. His assistant told me that there had been confusion with another customer. We were given an extra on-board credit for 150 dollars plus four bottles of wine.I think the travel agent sorted the problems out to our satisfaction and I would use ecruisestore again. However, I would keep copies of all correspondence and documents, and regularly check my credit card account for any extra charges."
Hello Antsy5 Luxemberg. You mention Bob Levenstein was CEO. Is he CEO of e-cruisestore.com? I thought he ran Cruise Compete. Are they the same person?
"Very interesting!I just posted a cruise on Cruisecompete and have already received 3 offers. None so far from ecruisestore, who were usually the first to reply.To me it means one of 2 things:1 They recognized my ""name"" (as I have dealt with them before) and chose not to reply, knowing I would not book with them anyway.2 Cruisecompete finally listened to us and dropped them from their list (I'd like to believe this one)"
"My experience with cruise compete is that sometimes some agencies bid and sometimes they don't. I doubt if given agencies bid on every single CC request, so maybe this is one that eCs just didn't bother with, or maybe they will in a day or two. I would be stunned if CC dumped them, so let's hope they recognized your name and didn't bother. "
"DO NOT USE RC TANNER, ECRUISESTORE.COM, GALAXY TRAVEL AND/OR GREAT-VACATIONS!!!!!I THOUGHT I HAD DONE MY HOMEWORK BEFORE BOOKING BUT HE IS USING SEVERAL COMPANY NAMES!YET ANOTHER HORROR STORY:To: Bob Levinstein, CEO CruiseCompeteOMG! I feel sick. In late July, we booked with RC Tanner (ecruisestore.com) for a 14 Day March 2010 Costa cruise. Yes, we paid in full and were double billed the next month. We disputed the double billing several weeks ago but have not yet received credit. Of course, our calls have gone unanswered.Our paperwork says Galaxy Travel and Great Vacations so I had not stumbled into the growing rants about ecruisestore.com. UNTIL NOW! We cruise several times a year and this is a first for us! Our 14 day cruise is still so far away, we now doubt if Costa cruise will ever see our money. We are now also concerned about additional fraud charges on our credit card. Bob Levinstein, I beg of you...please get involved. We need our money sent directly to Costa NOW! Please help us.  "
B. Levenstein of CC will maybe show you a note he wrote to or called eCs but that's all you're gonna get. Mr. Levenstein and CC are in the business of making money and everytime someone books a cruise vis a vis CC he gets a commission. One does not entirely bite the hand that feeds him.

"Who is ""OK""---IndianTickets?"
"July 9-09 a month after paying in full we (2 couples) had to write to ecruisesore.com about our Azamara Journey reservation August 30- September 13.Azamara Journey veranda cabins were booked (with Mr. Tanner) paid in full by credit card June 10-09. Ecruisestore.com offered discounts for paying in FULL by credit card on top of onboard credits. By July 9 flights to Copenhagen and from Barcelona and hotel stays in both cities were booked and paid. Credit card payments went through but when we went on line we had NO cruise. Neither couple was contacted by Mr. Tanner. Though he is the senior person at the company he handed it off to a Ms. Walker who got Ocean View Level 4. We paid for verandah level 6. After contacting Azamara customer service directly we found out ecruisestore.com DIDN'T send our money to Azamara so the booking was cancelled. Ms Walker did manage to get ecruise store to finally send the money to Azamara and got what cabins were left! One couple had their credit card double billed and that took another month to solve. In the end each couple got a veranda but we know it’s because we got in touch with Azamara since we knew our cabin numbers before ecruise sent them to us. Ecruise store also sent our hard copies late arriving just days before we left and one couple received documents with wrong cabin number, tags etc. Ecruisestore offered flimsy e mail apologies. Then our on board credits weren’t there either. Armed with copies of our documents Azamara e mailed ecruisestore after we set sail. We finally got our credits. Flimsy apologies from everyone involved. SO: DO NOT USE ECRUISESTORE.COM !"
"Lets see, that makes how many complaints compared to compliments for eCs?"
"When is the Florida State Attorney General's office going to getinvolved with these disreputable people !!!!! You would think thatthe buying public's overall impression of Florida and its popularity as a vacation destination would have significant impact on thepotential loss of revenue and ""bad karma"" that this cruise agencyis responsible for !!! Wonder what the real story is and who is inwhose pockets ????"
"My friend reported them to the Fla AG over 9 months ago and has heard exactly nothing since. We are talking government agency here, they will get around to ""looking into it "" in a few years."
"Today I submitted a request via CruiseCompete for a 2010 voyage we are interested in. So far I have received two replies, neither of which are from eCruisestore. However, one of the quotes was from Agent Richard Dare from a Florida agency called Great Cruise Vacations. This agency is located Lake Mary while eCruisestore is in Heathrow. The coincidence of these two towns is that they have the same zip code (32746). The quote from Richard Dare of Great Cruise Vacations is very similar to those I have received in the past from eCruisestore. For example, Great Cruise offers 5% savings for early payment. Anyone following this thread knows the 5% early payment savings means the agency runs your credit card through their business rather than calling it into the cruise line, and, well, you know the rest of the story of double & triple ""accidental"" billings to your credit card, etc. Their price quote was also drastically lower than the other quote I received (which is something that lured me to eCruiesstore to begin with earlier this year). At this point, I was of course suspicious that Great Cruise Vacations and eCruisestore are one in the same. So I called each of their toll-free numbers as well as entered the extentions for both Richard Dare (Great Vacations) and Richard Tanner (eCruisestore). Although the phone numbers are different, the voice mail for both Richards is exactly the same voice. Not only that, but the pre-recorded music they play is exactly the same while the system dials the extention! Although Great Cruise Vacations claims to have been in business for 18 years, they've been a CruiseCompete member agency since only July of this year. No surprise there since Cruisecompete was getting so many compliants with eCruisestore.It's beyond obvious both agencies are one in the same. No doubt eCruisestore was getting so much negative publicity they had to create a second name in order to keep business coming in. Go ahead and call each agency if you wish. The general recording you will get at both numbers is practically the same. Same office hours, same departments to be transferred to (Reservations, Customer Service, Documentation) etc. Great Cruise Vacations 800-445-4177 (Richard Dare ext 2488)eCruisestore 866-620-0941 (Richard Tanner ext 2332)So beware of any quotes you might get from Great Cruise Vacations."
"Check page 10 here, a poster said eCs changed their name to Cruise Planners and or Great Vacations so with all the similarities I'm sure the scam continues under this name and I bet CruiseCompete knows it too."
"convert94,You BET CruiseCompete knows about it! I knew about the reference to Galaxy Cruises on this thread, but was not aware of Great Cruise Vacations. My fear is that a lot of people won't make the connection between Richard Tanner and Richard Dare and the two ""different"" agencies. I wouldn't count on CruiseCompete CEO Levenstein helping a distressed eCruisestore or Great Cruises customer since CC obviously condones their business practices."
"Attn: gwb2125---Kudos to you! CrCompete makes a living by commissions from cruises sold vis a vis it's web site (it's called making a business profitable) and therefore is not about to bite the hand that feeds it, especially some are listed on CC's web site as one of their top providers. I'm sure now and then CC contacts Slime Inc., and tells them to shape up and thanks for the profit but otherwise don't expect them to boot 'em.Anyone who buys an online cruise or an online anything without first doing an extensive background check is asking for it, and they do sometimes get it as witnessed this forum going on now for two plus years. I predict the unscrupulous will continue to swindle and con unsuspecting consumers forever, just as they have since time began. Remember P.T. Barnum!"
"I'm really glad I found this thread.How can this guy Richard Tanner/Dare/scumbag, and the complicit cruisecompete.com continue to get away with this?Isn't it an open and shut case of fraud to ""accidentally"" double or overcharge people dozens of times?"
"From what I can compile, this guy has gone by Richard Tanner, Richard Dare, and ""RC.""The business names or websites he uses or used:Galaxy Travelecruisestore.comGreat Cruise VacationsThe most recent quote I saw on CruiseCompare.com showed him as Richard Dare with Great Cruise Vacations."
"Some Good News. I posted a few months ago to say that I had been sucked in by Cruise Compete/e Cruise Store and had my credit card billed twice for the deposit. I also paid up front to get the ""Special 10% Discount.As soon as I realised the situation through this site and Cruise Critic I cancelled the Cruise I booked for next year and immediately disputed the charges through my credit card company.I have just returned from a 23 day Hal Cruise on the Ryndam and to my great pleasure I found that all of my payments to eCruise Store had been credited back to my card. Nothing had been deducted and even although I had a loss on the US Dollar exchange rate, that was also taken care of.I will never book again through Cruise Compete. I spoke to a number of people on our Ryndam Cruise and have picked up a few reputable travel agents names so will be looking at some of them to rebook my Princess Cruise for next year.Thanks to everyone for bringing to my notice the workings of this crooked organisation."
"Cruises N More is in Lake Mary, Florida too...are they affiliated? Is it all one big agency under different names?"
cruises-n-more is not ecruisecompete..its a different agency!
I've gotten quotes from Cruises N More on Cruise Compete though.
"It's the same agency people - just different names to trIp folksup -- if the address is Lake Mary, Florida -- then they are onein the same. DO NOT bOOK WITH THEM !!!"
I believe Cruises-N-More is somehow affiliated with American Express.They are definitely not the same as ecruisestore and they are reputable.I hope this helps.
"Please disregard my earlier postings about Cruises N More.I should have said "" Great Cruise Vacations"" out of Lake Mary, Florida.Some of the agents first names are the same for ex: Richard and Cathy but different last names. I even think the address isthe same as ECruiseStore."
"I just got an email from ""Galaxy Travel"" aka Great Vacations aka Ecruisestore.com. Galaxy Travel is the company my husband and I booked our cruise through. Thus, I did not find out about any of these problems during my upfront search. They have now declared bankruptcy and advised that we file a dispute with our credit card company in order to get a refund. I suppose this means that our money has been lost? We paid ""in full"" for a 2 week Costa Cruise back in July. When double-billed in August, we filed a dispute and changed our credit card number to protect ourselves from further charges. Fortunately, that money was credited to our account. In August, Costa refused to get involved - despite the fact that their sister company (Princess) had refused to accept bookings with this company. We knew this bankruptcy was inevitable but no one would help!Operating under various names, this man/company is a criminal. This was my first time using Cruisecompete. I will NEVER use them again. They allowed him to continue operating despite knowledge of his fraudulent activity. BEWARE - No doubt this man/company will turn up again with yet another name!"
"WOW !!! Was wondering how long it would take for ECruiseStore to go under --------- I feel really bad for all those who still havetravel booked with them -- hopefully, they have some protection either with their cc companies, or the Florida State Attorney General's office. I am sure this has been done before by thisman --- wonder how many times he can shut down one location and re-open with a new name but the same devious tactics. Perhaps with all the ""burnt"" clients who have postrd here --- the authoritieswill finally step in. Thanks for the info."
"Okay, now how can we go about criminally prosecuting the owners of this company?Those involved are like Bernie Madoff and should face jail time."
"What's upsetting is that cruisecritic.com deletes threads that mention these fraudulent companies.In fact, they delete threads that even ALLUDE to these companies, or hint at cruisecompete.com, or any of the scammers whatsoever. Even if you don't name them.It is no surprise that these people can continue to operate. Even if they are shut down, all they have to do is open up under a new name, as evidenced here."
I am very glad that this company has (hopefully) been shut down. I nearly booked through them last year. Phew.I just wanted to add that Cruises-n-more is definitely not associated with them. I have had three successful bookings through them.
"I should have read this forum about ecruisestore before we lost lots of money when it suddently went bankrupt and left us holding the bag for the balance of our Oceania cruise. Stupidly, we paid the full amount upfront and were advised of the insolvency on the date that our full amount was to be transferred to the cruise company. We booked along with our friends and both of us had money debited to our VISA account, a mistake, they said. The money was returned after a few phone calls. Unfortunately, eCruisestore is probably setting up under a new name and will continue to bilk travellers who think they are getting a good deal."
I do not know when people will learn if they offer you a big discount to pay upfront then the company is in trouble. So you got a big discount on what??????Nothing!! and a lot of people have nothing to show for their money Some Credit card companies will reverse the charges so contact them ASAP Hope you get your money back
"We live in Southeast Florida and always book cruises with Brigid Hastings. We cruise a lot. She works out of an internet site as well. We have used her the last three times. She has been prompt and reliable. I believe we used her for our Panama Canal cruise too. We went to Northern Europe and St. Pete as well with her.She gets us all the information and includes airfare if needed. I am pasting her information below. I do not get a commision or anything else for this. I just think she really does a good job. Right now we are using her for a Princess Cruise out of Singapore on Dec. 2. Her prices are about the best I found anywhere and she does try to get you an upgrade if u ask her. She does not always succeed, but at least she tries. Now, my disclaimer: Please dont blame me for anything because I really maybe just lucky with her..but so far not complaints. themayblums@yahoo.com. Also I never talk to anyone if she is not there I leave a message. Her email is: brigidh@cruiseweb.com240.487.0155 ext. 248 Local / InternationalThats all I know. Good Luck!!"
"Dear ""lht28"" -- Thanks for your compassionate response --- what makes you think thatall of these victums did NOT do their homework before booking with ECruiseStore ??After all, they come very highly recommended by www.cruisecompete.com which isSUPPOSED TO BE a no-biased site for informational purposes. It's not like going toyour local Walmart and buying a pair of jeans !. (I for one, was very surprised aboutthe ""kick-backs"" that www.cruisecompete.com receives from these represented agencies ). And. Yes, I also checked them out withthe Florida BBB but they are/were not members. That in itself is NOT to say thata particular company or store is dishonest or crooks --(many merchants chose not tobelong because of the membership fees). As far as paying in advance and using one's credit cards --- (thinking you are protected against fraud and inferior merchandise) --- that was a very expensive lesson learned. My cc compainies DID NOTHING for me as far as getting my money back. So, this was a very expensive""lesson learned"". There are other - reputible TA's that offer discounts, and other perksso why would an unsuspecting customer suspect that ECruiseStore would put them through all kinds of HELL, stess and aggravation in the end. I just hope that enoughof us can file compliants with the Florida State Attorney General and get some typeof satisfaction (if it's in the form of $$$ would be frosting on the cake). JMO."
"Well said, CruisinMama!If it hadn't have been for CruiseCompete, I never would have come across this agency.BTW cruises-n-more offered the same perks (less the prepay booking bonus) that eCruiseStore offered- the difference was that I had no response to my email from cruises-n-more and the response from eCruiseStore was immediate, friendly and knowledgeable. In hindsight, I was dealing with a female ""snake in the grass"" who has to be as good a con artist as the infamous RT.$$ compensation would be even sweeter if the perpetrators of this fraud got time in the Big House as well!"
If any TA offers you a big discount to pay upfront in advance RUN.If the payment goes to the agency & not the cruise line or tour operator RUNThere are so many red flags in the stories of people who used them.This thread was started over 2yrs ago so that tells you how many people do not do research on the companiesThey probably have been doing this for year but this time with the recession they are not getting more people to keep their pot full..in order to stay in business.Seems they may be still operating under other names Buyer beware
"Dear lht28: Just for the record, when I first learned about http://www.tripadvisor.com/ and checked into ECruiseStore there were only about 5 postings --- some good and othersnot great --- I know from personal experience that ""you can't please all people all of the time"" - so I gave the agency the ""benefit of the doubt"" about the negative comments.Yes, in retrospect, I certainly regret dealing with these ""schisters"" - only after they hadmy full payment in their grubby hands --- did my troubles begin. I also feel very quiltyfor the other couple that I had referred to the agency and who, also, had major billingissues with them. Once on our cruise, I even met another couple who have taken over100 cruiises and they also were ""burned"" --- so I guess even experienced travelers arenot exempt from fraud. Sure hope everytning in your life goes according to plan withno bumps in the road."
Cruisinmamasorry you lost out with ecruise but as stated you should NEVER pay the agent only the cruise line.If someone offered me a deal to save money if I paid in full long before final payment I would NOT take the offer. It would set my red flags upYou have learned a valuable life lesson...
"They are not reputable and filed for bankrupcy on 10/25. We prepaid a cruise in May, and just discovered that all they sent ot the cruise line was $900.00. We were promised a shipboard credit of $655 and 3% back on our credit card is we paid in full. Have checked with the cruise line and they only received $900 deposit. At this point, we have filed a dispute with the credit card company. I understand that they are doing business under different names."
what is the likelihood of getting money back from the credit card company for a prepaid cruise after this so-called TA went bankrupt. They ( credit card company ) refunded me the full amount for now pending an investigation but am concerned they may not allow it to stick . Like other I prepaid a Jan 2010 cruise in July 2009
"I was fortunate to see the red flags before it was too late. When they offered a nice discount off the cruise fare, plus generous shipboard credits, I didn't flinch and put down my deposit (which went to the cruise line). It was about two weeks after deposit when their accounting department (not Richard Tanner/Dare, etc) emailed a ""special offer"" of an additional 10% off and another $250 shipboard credit if paid in full now (roughly nine months prior to departure). At this point I sat down and started crunching the numbers and when you combined the fare discounts with the shipboard credits, this represented 30% of the total fare. I don't think there's an agency out there that makes 30% commission, no matter how high their sales volume with any particular cruise line. But also, the cruise line I was booked with (Crystal) offers 3.5% fare reduction when you pay 6 months in advance. So I replied to the ""special offer"" email asking if Crystal's 3.5% discount would also apply as I was paying 9 months in advance. The reply back was ""no"". At that moment, I knew this agency was NOT going to call Crystal with my credit card for final payment, because if they did, Crystal would automatically deduct the 3.5% off the fare on their books. It was that ""special offer"" email that got me to searching the Internet on this scam agency and I thankfully found this thread. I've used CruiseCompete a number of times over the years and never had any problems with other member Travel Agencies. Luckily I have these agency contacts and no longer need to go through CruiseCompete to find them. I don't want CruiseCompete to get another dime of referral commissions from their member agencies since they knowingly allowed eCruisestore to continue scamming their clients. CruiseCompete should have dumped eCruisestore the minute they learned how they do business. I hope everyone that has future cruises through eCruisestore is able to work with the cruise line and your credit card companies in order to be made whole."
"Beware of solicitations. Can you believe the following email I just opened?""I am contacting you regarding the cruise that you made through ecruisestore.com who went out of business on Oct 25th. You are reserved on _____________I have booked you personally before on an Asia Princess cruise tour back in 2005We are Cruise Vacation Outlet a Member agency of CruiseCompete.com and we have been asked to contact you in regards to taking over your current reservation in order to attempt to maintain your discounted cruise rates and amenities from the cruise lines. We are open 7 days a week from 9 am to 8 pm. Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss the details of your reservation.""Aside from the audacity of CruiseCompete's sharing my infomation with this agency, is the false statement from the agent that I had previously booked an Asian Princess cruise with her personally!!!"
TMLAalumDid you book a cruise with the other agency back in 2005?Or is this a scam for the ecruisestore to get you again?Ask them to turn the booking over to the cruiseline if you do not want to use their services.....then shop around
"NEVER booked a cruise with them or ever went to SE Asia. In fact, my booking this agency would love to have me transferred to them, was brokered by eCS to Millstream Travel the day I made it w/ Cathy Ireland @ eCS! At lease, Millstream is a legit agency that, unfortunately, has become the middleman for many of us eCS ""suckers"".CruiseCompete or eCS must have provided my info to this agency. As the old adage goes. ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me."" After CruiseCompete led me to eCS, why would this agency think that I would do business with another CruiseCompete agency?"
TMLAalumDid you get caught in the pay up front scam ?Hope it all works out for you with your cruise
"Yep, paid up front. And 3 other couples with us did too. 2 of them have had their payments minus deposits (which are with the cruiseline) credited by their cc companies. 2 of us are awaiting the dispute papers from our cc companies which we will then fill out and return."
My credit card company has already put the credit on my card (in dispute). This is a definate case of fraud. They took our money and never paid the cruise line. Contact your credit card company immediately. I had to provide paperwork and fill out dispute forms. I will never use and online agencey again.
"I can't believe the message! I would like very much to contact Cruise Compete. Does anyone have a phone number for them? Thanks for sharing. This whole situation is mind blowing. It just seems to get worse each day. Thanfully, our credit card company was able to credit the monies and put the charge in dispute. I was told that we would be okay. Our reservation was rebooked through the Cruise Line."
There are so many stories on Cruise Critic of people losing their money & the cruise they did not check until too late to realize the TA did not send their money some were fortunate to start questioning the TA /cruiseline after final payment but it took months to resolvedBe sure to fill out you online account with your cruise line & check often to make sure all is OK
"I forwarded that email from CruiseVacationOutlet to my rep at Millstream. She was glad I did because not a half hour later she emailed me back with this:""I just spoke with a reservation agent at Royal Caribbean who had a Richard on the line from “Cruise Vacation Outlet”, seeking to take over several bookings that were formerly eCruise bookings. We may have more pieces to this puzzle. I will keep you posted with what I learn. Feel free to share the information with your fellow travelers.""I sure have my suspicion about this Richard's last name."
"I have an email address for the CEO of CruiseCompete. If anyone would like to have it, send me a message. I'm not sure I can publish it on this forum."
TMLAalumI suspect you have something there They probably opened many online agencies & just bounce from one to another as they get found out. When it gets too hot they close
"Yes, I would like to have the address. I am also contact the State of Florida Fraud Division regarding this. I want to do more than jump on a bandwagon of individuals that were taken advantage of. Maybe we can make a difference."
"Well, I was one of the victums, also (read my earlier postings about Cathy Ireland and our RCCL Mariner trip this past Jan.'09.) Unfortunately when I called my cc companies(Bank of America and Discover) --- the final outcome was that no refunds could be madeback to me as the ORIGINAL PURCHASE DATE was 6 months and NOT 60 days (eventhough I would not leave on the cruise until 7 months after making full payment). So,if anyone has any other suggestions on how I can still file a ""dispute"" -- please let meknow. I also would like the addresses of the Florida State Attorney General, and the Florida State Fraud Division. Thanks."
I am very surprised to hear of your experience with your credit card companies. There are five couples who booked and paid in full. All of us either had a visa or mastercard. Not one of us had difficulty with our credit card companies. They immediately put the charge in dispute and credited our account. I did have to provide information and fill out paperwork.
"I just returned from my cruise to canada, booked thru ecruisestore.com. DO NOT USE THIS TRAVEL AGENT !!!!!I could go on and on about the problems associated with this agency.Double Billing, incorrect pricing, on board credits that were not credited to our account. etc. etc.I contacted them this morning after returning from my cruise, only to get a reply that they are no longer in business.I booked three cabins on this cruise and we are out about $3500 that should have been refunded to us.Take my advice and book directly with the cruise company about three months before you want to go. This is the best time to secure the best rates."
"I filed a brief complaint at the FL attorney general's website under the ""Economic Crimes"". I named 3 individuals who corresponded/talked to my husband or myself as well as the agency.Here is the link: myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/18A7753257…"
Have also filed a complaint - these crooks (including cruise compete) need to be stopped
"I wish I had found this site prior to using eCruisestore to book a cruise. I short, I was cheated out of $8,000.00 by them. My cruise bill was almost $23,000 and eCruisestore withheld the 8 thousand from the cruise line. They DID give the cruise line my credit card number, however. Then, the cruise line came back and charge me for the shortfall. I have received only 2 thousand back from Tanner and I doubt if I'll ever see the rest.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
"Thank you for posting the link to the Florida Attorney General. We have also filed a complaint. Thankfully, we were reimbursed by our credit card company for the money taken by Galaxy Travel (aka ecruisestore.com). This company has cost us such time and grief. So many phone calls and emails. We even canceled our credit card. I am very willing to participate in prosecution of this criminal! Now, we will rebook this cruise and try to forget the bad experience. Lesson learned: BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN CHOOSING YOUR TRAVEL PROVIDER AND NEVER PAY UPFRONT UNLESS IT IS A LAST MINUTE TRIP!"
"Has anyone been able to actually locate Richard C Tanner? I suspect this name is an alias because the matches that come up when I google him don't seem to actually be him! And the name Cathy Ireland certainly sounds like a fictitious one as well.BTW, I haven't had a response from the Florida AG."

"At Sea a Lot-Your research is phenomenal. Thank you. From reviewing my credit card statement online, it appears that my dispute w/ eCS is upheld, as the monies prepaid for my 2010 cruise have been credited. However, I will not relax until I receive written confirmation of the this from the cc bank.The information you provided will be helpful for anyone scammed by eCS who would like to pursue the matter further. I wonder if taking him to small claims court is a possibility, especially for anyone who lives in Florida...."
wow ...good detective work

"Thanks so much for all this new info --- I certainly will be filing my own compliants ASAP. May not get any money back but want to be as close to the head of the lineas possible. Thanks, again."
A travel agency has taken over my reservation which was book originally by ecruise. They informed me that they are doing business again under different names and that the names that travel agent working for them use are not their real names. Beware!
Unbelivable !!!!!!! Why am I NOT surprized !!
"This is what I received from Richard Dare (is that his real name?) ""It is with deep regret that we must inform you that due to recent financial problems, we have been forced to close the business effective October 25, 2009.Any current reservations have been turned over to the cruise line as a direct booking. From now on you will need to contact the cruise line direct regarding any questions about your cruise.Sincerely,Great VacationsThis was booked through richard@bestcabinsbestprices.com. The phone number is Galaxy Travel. The person helping him and emailing me was from ecruises. After reading Travel Advisor. I cancelled in Oct. and he moved our reservation to Celebrity, promising we would still get our gratuity credit of $280. That won't happen now of course but I feel fortunate that we got away with losing only that much after reading these stories. Of course these people still have our credit card and passport numbers. Thank you for your trip advisor posts! Probably saved us a lot. I hope all of you get every penny back and more."
"Consider your self very lucky. I lost $650 in shipboard credit plus a $10.00 processing fee. In addition, have spent considerable time on a dispute with my credit card company and rebooking of our trip."
"Wow. Richard Dare, Richard Tanner, Richard Turner- all one and the same scam artist! Now he is with Cruise Vacation Outlet, using who-knows-what alias.I cannot believe that the Florida AG isn't investigating his fraudulent practices of soliciting bookings with promises of great OBCs and even greater benefits thru prepayment. And, why aren't the credit card companies upset over all the disputed double and triple charges by Galaxy, eCruiseStore, etc.I am grateful that my prepayment was returned by my credit card company, but would like to know if they were reimbursed by eCS or just taking a loss. And where is all the thousand of $$ collected by eCS if they are ""bankrupt""?"
In response to your interest about the Florida Attorney General I have a letter from the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumers services which basically tells me there is nothing they can do to help.Galaxy Travel AKA eCruiseStore was a member of the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) which as a law passed by the Florida Legislature exempted them from having to register or post financial security with the state.I am in it for the tune of $6700+ and hoping that Discover Card will come through. I issued a complaint with them on Oct 26th and have heard nothing since except I have to wait and wait.I am in the process of putting a complaint to ARC. Maybe it might help stop this type of scam in the future.
I understand that you are also a victim of eCruiseStore AKA Galaxy Travel and several other names. I am in the process of filing complaints with several agencies and one of them Airline Reporting Corporation (ARC) asks if I can identify other victims. If you are interested you can reach me at artmc1@hotmail.com.I will explain further once we make contact.ThanksArtmc1
