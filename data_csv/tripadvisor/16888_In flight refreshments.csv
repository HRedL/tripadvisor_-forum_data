Flying from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg with South African Airways. Will any refreshments be served ? (Reason is I'm diabetic !)
"Check with the airline. As a diabetic, I would think that you would always carry a ""little something"" with you,just in case of a hypoglycemic episode, the way my late mother used to. She was a type 1 diabetic, on twice daily insulin shots, from 1953 until she died in 2001, of causes unrelated to her diabetes mellitus.Good luck."
"Thanks QOD1, I do carry something, a few sweets, but prefer to feed in gently, only type 2"
It’s just an hour+ flight. They might serve a drink and pretzels. What does “feed in gently” mean? There’s no such think as “only” type 2. It’s an epidemic.
"Thanks cbir, I feed in my carbohydrates slowly, Howvwer Type 2 Diabetes is NOT an Epidemic , a Epidemic is a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time."
