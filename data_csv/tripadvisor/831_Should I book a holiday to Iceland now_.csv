"Hi, I'm considering travelling from the UK to Iceland this May or June.I just wanted to check from Icelanders how operational the country was because the government seems to be OKing tourism (European tourists don't even need to quarantine upon arrival). Are national parks open? And other attractions like the Blue Lagoon? Are cafes/restaurants/bars open? And can you book accommodation and vehicle rental? And is travel within Iceland for tourism allowed?Is there any other reason I should book another time instead of now?Many thanks,Richard"
"This year?Stay home. Follow the advice of everyone.Nature is open, but hotels, shops and restaurants aren’t.Edited: 6:00 am, April 08, 2020 "
<< Is there any other reason I should book another time instead of now? >>Covid-19 and the advice of your own government.
">>And other attractions like the Blue Lagoon? Are cafes/restaurants/bars open?<<Blue Lagoon is currently CLOSED, including the associated hotels, retail and restaurants.https://www.bluelagoon.com/blue-lagoon-icela…They say that is through April 30, but as we know those deadlines can, and have been, extended (into May, or June? Who knows at this point?)."
"Great, thanks ArchAngel. Do you know about National Parks for instance?To the previous posters, thanks, I know some countries are taking a 'no non-essential travel' attitude to the crisis but others like Sweden and Iceland don't seem to be and I'm v interested in getting the view from Icelanders on what the situation really is like on the ground."
The message from our government is no ‘non essential travel’ Travelling to an airport is non essential so you can’t get to the airport. You can not travel.We are self isolating and social distancing in UK so why would you want to travel to another country? Let alone that you may take or bring back the virus. It doesn’t matter what is happening in Iceland it is our legislation you must follow.I’m sorry but I shake my head when people think the rules don’t apply to them.
Iceland has been urging any residents that are overseas to return home. The government is paying Icelandair to run some flights vfor now to repatriate citizens. But an article from yesterday says the availability of flights after Easter may be slim.https:/…
"The FCO UK government has said,2. Do not travel abroad unless it’s essentialThe FCO advised British people against all non-essential travel worldwide. This applies for an indefinite period due to unprecedented international border closures and other restrictions. All countries may restrict travel without notice. It’s the word indefinitely the OP needs to understand. There will be an end date no one knows when, I guess many months away."
"Richard, you're really considering traveling THIS May or June? Perhaps you need to spend some time reading up on what's going on in the world. This virus is not going to just go away anytime soon. I haven't canceled my planned trip to Iceland in August, but I'm also not holding out much hope that we'll be able to travel that soon."
"Easter is here, and many Icelanders like to head off to their ""summer"" homes in the countryside at this time of year, I believe (I´m a British immigrant). The Icelandic Govt has asked them not to do so this year. Iceland is a little less locked down than the UK, from what I can gather from my UK family and news. Gatherings of up to 20 are allowed here, as long as those from different households stay 2m apartMost bars/restaurants/shops are closed, though there are a few still open. The few still operating rigorously enforce a 20 person maximum at any one timeReykjavík is very quiet and there is not a lot going on. It´s not a good time to come. The 20 person gathering restriction is in force until early May at the earliestI would definitely not book anything now, if you really want to come in June, and it is safe to do so, I would leave it until a week or 2 before travelling to book, and see what is available. This is in addition to what the UK government advises on travel. For example, if I return to the UK in the next few days for some sort of emergency, when I come back to Iceland, I would have to quarantine for 14 days...maybe this could happen to you when you got back to the UK?leave it for now, and have a look at the local and worldwide situation in a few weeks"
"<< For example, if I return to the UK in the next few days for some sort of emergency, when I come back to Iceland, I would have to quarantine for 14 days...maybe this could happen to you when you got back to the UK? >>Not to mention that the OP, and other tourists, may soon be required to quarantine on arrival in Iceland as well, in which case they had better be planning a trip that lasts longer than 14 days!April 8, 2020 https:/…“In yesterday’s press briefing Þórólfur Guðnason [Iceland’s Chief Epidemiologist] expressed the view that the government’s policy regarding tourists arriving in Iceland should be reviewed, Frettabladid reports. There has been much criticism of the government’s decision to exempt tourists from mandatory quarantines for people entering Iceland. It’s highly likely that Þórólfur’s public recommendation that tourist restrictions be tightened will prompt a change in government policy in the coming days.”"
The OP is asking for reasoned opinions on when Iceland will reopen. It's a fair question. Obviously nobody knows for sure but telling people not to make plans until we have 100% certainty is not helpful or even good advice. At some point people will be allowed to travel and Iceland will welcome visitors. Will that be June? August? October? 2021? Personally I am betting on early summer as Iceland is not in the same boat as Italy. But it depends on whether a rapid test is available (to ensure visitors are healthy) and how much risk the government is willing to take. It would be smart not to book a reservation that is non-refundable or requires pre-payment. But otherwise why not roll the dice? What do you have to lose? Iceland is the safest country in the world and I would much rather be there now than most of the rest of the world.
Thanks everyone. really useful. Will wait and see how things pan out in either country.
