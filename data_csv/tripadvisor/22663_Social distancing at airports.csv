"The only safe thing is to prohibit air travel. How on earth can any reasonable measure of 'social distancing' be maintained at passport checks and luggage conveyors, as they mention by example.And for being 'triaged' at an airport terminal this might mean being told to arrive 4 or 5 hours before your flight to allow time for your possible health check.And what if they miss someone and a whole aircraft load has to be traced and later quarantined?Edited: 3:48 am, May 05, 2020 "
"It certainly isn't possible to 'social distance' either at airports or on aircraft.The only way is to test people before the flight. Probably within 48 hours before.Yes, there is a possibility that people could contact the virus in that 48 hours, but life is a risk and people will just have to decide whether that risk is worth taking or would rather stay locked in their house for the next year or so.Even if you get the virus, it isn't a death sentence.Reminder - in the UK we are currently dumping £2.4b per day from our economy and heading for the biggest recession ever - one that will certainly kill people - in order to tackle a virus with a mortality rate of 0.0013%"
"Total UK coronavirus cases as at 5th May - 190,584. Total UK deaths from coronavirus 28,734. My calculator says that is a death rate of 15.0768%. Not quite the insignificant figure Holidaymaker would have us believe and certainly not the kind of odds that appeal to me."
"Perhaps HO and Steve55 could give us the basis on which they made their calculations. Neither of their percentage figures make sense to me. If you calculate UK deaths against the UK population, the death rate is approx 0.048%"
"I concede to your percentage BF.But even so, less than half of one tenth of one percent chance of dying from the disease?As said, if people don't want to take that risk, the option will always be there to stay at home."
Source of figures here - https:/…2020-03-26 .
"Absolutely, HO, it's a question of individual choice. Stay at home or travel abroad (subject to the rules and regulations for the time being of the country you're leaving and the country you're going to)."
"Thanks, Steve, but it's difficult to find amongst all that data on the ONS site the figure you quote. I suspect your 15% figure is the percentage of deaths amongst those identified with Covid-19 by testing. But this is a spurious figure because the level of testing in the UK has been poor and most experts reckon that many more millions have been infected (and recovered) but haven't been tested."
"I can only go by the figures available, whether the true figure is higher or not is conjecture and will no doubt emerge in due course."
"Whatever the mortality rate is at present, surely it’s artificially low because of the measures taken by the Government. Without lockdown who knows what it would be. Whether to travel when we can will be up to individuals."
"There is an increasingly popular concept in the travel industry that the way to revive it again is to introduce some kind of meassures that will boost confidence to travel again. I think this is fundamentaly wrong. Mass business travel is not resuming anytime soon, companies just won't do it for variety of reasons. Probably for the first time in history, travel industry relies on leisure travellers. And they will only travel if it's more fun than staying at home.Here's the problem: Many in travel industry are going to spend a lot of effort on convincing people who are afraid to travel, that it's safe. We already see it happening with some airlines making face masks compulsory despite utter lack of scientific proof they are useful - it's only done for a show, to create a sense of safety. But it's never gonna work, people who are really scared of the virus and travelling will not change their mind just because people around them have that useless piece of cloth on their face.In the process, airlines and other travel industry businesses are losing customers who are actually fine with travelling, who are not scared of the virus, but who will ultimately put off by the miserable experience that is being offered with all these measures.At the end of the day, no one travels. Airlines won't manage to persuade those who are scared, while those who aren't won't have any reason to spend their money if they don't get a nice experience in return. The only sustainable strategy in my opinion is to give up on business from those who are currently scared, focus on providing streamlined experience to those who crave to travel again and let social media to the rest - once those currently-scared people see that their friends are having a good time and there are no negative consequences, they may change their mind as well. Personally, I'm ready to pump my money into travel industry once any place in the EU offers me to have a good experience (and some non-EU destinations would be acceptable too). But as long as I'm expected to wear a face mask and sit behind an acrylic glass in the restaurant (this has actually been proposed somewhere), I'm staying at home, drinking wine and sunbathing on my balcony. It's cheaper.Final note: When you guys carculate mortality of the disease, you should realize that not everyone is diagnosed. Most Covid-19 patients will never see a doctor and many will not even notice they are sick (after all, that's precisely what makes Covid so infectious). Dividing number of DETECTED cases with the number of deaths is gonna give you a number that has no statistical value."
"dividing number of detected cases with number of deaths is gonna give you a number that has no statistical value,very true.the percentage of deaths per population does have value and everybody should look at that.what is happening doesn't make sense to me unless it was pre-planned."
Talking percents is useless unless you also give the data subjects. Percent of deaths world wide based on total population is less than 0.001% Percent of deaths based on people tested is higher. Percent of deaths based on people diagnosed is higher still . So please clarify your stats .
"#12 - I don't think it's pre-planned. I think people are simply scared, so they panic. And when people panic, they usually make all the wrong choices. Unfortunatelly, we live in the age where political leadership is dead and replaced with populism. And serious media are replaced with social networks where fear gets far more exposure than analysis, rational thinking and any kind of positive news. We will have a lot to reflect on in two years or so...Edited: 9:11 am, May 07, 2020 "
"Although I’m in no great rush to get back on an aircraft, I will do one day in the future, that may may be when a vaccine has been found (and all flyers will have to provide proof of inoculation) or more inventive ways of seating arrangements can be found. I’m surprised no one has mentioned an ‘air hood’ type of face shield for travellers to wear whilst aboard. It will be uncomfortable for the duration but may be an worth putting up with for a couple of hours. I think some front line nurses already use them with the air supplied via its own power pack strapped around the waist."
Poster#15....I've also been thinking along those lines.How about something like this for wearing on the aircraft then pop on when out & about in Funchal https://photos.app.goo.gl/HmcnZ9yuSzKgf1Ba8Rob...Enjoy VE day folks
"We use air hoods at work (manufacturing industry using chlorine..), and they are excellent but supplied by a compressor. Maybe airlines could adapt their ventilation systems to enable air hoods to be ‘plugged in’ like some posh integral vacuum systems can do to avoid them trailing hoses around?"
"I read the other day that if 'social distancing' is to be forced upon airports that the check-in queue for a 747 could be 300 metres long if three abreast. Forcing people to stand in a queue for maybe an hour in the time before was bad enough. Will people really be happy with a queue snaking out across the airport car park in the rain?And what about the 2 metres rule on airport transfer buses and those big ones they use at some airports to take you from the terminal out to some remote stand? They would need five or six buses where one or two currently suffice.As for hoods, I can hardly breathe even in the flimsy disposable masks we now have to wear when shopping (after 6 weeks of not having to wear them!) and like many I suspect would be totally claustrophobic in anything more substantial. And taking a drink would be a problem while hooded.Not long ago wearing mask at an airport would be inviting a polite enquiry from the forces of law and order. If it's going to be compulsory how are they are going to identify those intent on evil?And all this over one virus. How many people have other undetected contagions that could kill and are somehow not being mentioned?"
"I really can't see people accepting air hoods. That's just not gonna happen. Even face masks will detter people from flying.Airlines need to stop thinking about how to make the experience even more miserable. Just keep the middle seat empty for a few months, the demand will be fairly low anyway."
"Post 18 - you make a good point.There has always been a risk on any flight (or anywhere else, for that matter) of coming into contact with someone with a contagious disease.The most likely way forward is that we will have to have a test for Covid within 48 hours of travel.Some will say - but what if you then catch it within that 48 hours?Well, that is a risk. But life is full of risks. We would never do anything if we tried to avoid all risks.If that's not a risk you wish to take, then don't go on holiday.Rob - love that suit! Imagine turning ups at the airport in that!Edited: 4:42 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Re plug-in airhoods mentioned earlier, I heard an aviation ""expert"" on TV the other day say that social distancing on planes is a complete waste of time as the air in the plane is re-circulated through the ventilation system so any virus present in the air will be distributed to all passengers.True or not, I know not."
"You would be highly unlikely to be infected by air recirculated on an aircraft, as it is passed through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters which can trap particles much smaller than the COVD-19 virus. Here is a link to the WHO report on the subject:https:/…You are more likely to catch it from a person seated near you."
"The810 at post #19 makes a very valid point. Who is going to undergo a miserable experience just to go somewhere for 2 weeks holiday? Air travel was unpleasant enough before this, what with the jobsworth little Hitlers in security and all the other inconveniences airports have developed. Then it’s on the plane, crammed in like sardines for an uncomfortable few hours with no attempt by the crew to alleviate the tedium other than trying to sell things you don’t want or would have bought beforehand at a fraction of the price if you did. Now it seems we may have to wear masks and who knows what other impositions dreamt up by some faceless goon somewhere and then, to top it all, when we arrive at our destination will be treated to a re-creation of Ellis Island, herded into long lines, subjected to questioning and who knows what health checks and then maybe forced into isolation somewhere. And all just for a couple of weeks elsewhere.Suddenly staying here begins to seem attractive."
"With the current fine weather my partner and I sit outside in our suntrap garden with a bottle of wine and pretend we're in Madeira but somehow, Steve55, it just doesn't seem the same.Can't wait to get back there - hopefully in early September, but who knows."
"Likewise, Bucksfizz... Happy Hour (now renamed 'Not quite as Unhappy Hour' started early today with the National Toast at 3 pm.Our visit in June will no doubt be cancelled, but still holding out hopes for December.Here's to future holidays in Madeira! (hic)Edited: 12:02 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"I think everyone on this forum can't wait to travel again :) But the question is what will travel look like.As I said before, I'll be very happy to pump my money into the travel industry on the same day the first country openly claims that it welcomes tourists (seriously, I'm willing to pack my stuff and leave tonight :)). But only as long as I can have a pleasant experience with as few restrictions at possible. If anyone expects me to wear a face mask, get at the hotel before curfew and eat McDonald's at the park bench, I'm staying home and saving my money for better days.Edited: 12:31 pm, May 08, 2020 "
Post 23..Steve you are so funny..I mean that in a good wayIf you weren't trying to be funny what can I say ? I'm in a lockdown stupour. I want to go back to Madeira sooner rather than later but only if there is a good degree of freedom as I'll be travelling on my own this timeBest Wishes to all forum users hope you all stay well
"I think this has been a salutary lesson for anyone who might believe that the likes of Madeira, with its heavy dependance on tourist revenue, has any genuine interest in the welfare of these self-same tourists when the chips are down. Evidence the tribulations, the evacuations from hotels the difficulties with flights but no assistance whatsoever by the local authority. Perhaps something to keep in mind for anyone considering future trips there.Edited: 4:43 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Referring to reply 20, ""If that's not a risk you wish to take, then don't go on holiday."" it's fairly well known that you are most likely to be injured or die in an accident in your own home, which even in 'normal' times is where you would be most of the day.Nothing is risk free. This near paranoia trying to reduce one particular risk to zero is, I think, starting to cause more problems than it is solving. The increasingly convoluted suggestions and preventative measures related to mass travel are examples. One example is is that, instead of the increased traumas of flying, people are more likely to drive to the Algarve for their holiday even though it would take longer. Tens of thousands of extra cars on the roads every day and trying to find somewhere to park are the last thing most resorts need. Not to mention the extra noise and pollution.Not an option for Madeira I grant you, so how much will the tourist industry on that island suffer in the long term?One can only hope that some level of common sense eventually prevails, for aspects everyday life if not holidays."
Very good point made by Steve
"""This near paranoia trying to reduce one particular risk to zero is, I think, starting to cause more problems than it is solving.""Amen to that."
"Unbelievable these guys at the top.They are well out of toch with reality.It would have given his company so much good publicity if he had gave that speech at the top of the aircraft steps before boarding the aircraft.Instead he gave it in a lovely cosy,social distancing enviromenthttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53049338Rob"
Note the bit at the end of the BBC report where it says Easyjet intends to open 50% of its routes and 75% later. That's not flights but ROUTES.
The Easyjet fare from Gatwick to Glasgow today - £175! 5 times the previous fare. Are they perhaps trying to make up for losses?
It's £160 return on Tuesday.
"This was never about a virus, its a textbook political power grab."
"There is some talk of passengers not being allowed to take hand luggage onto aircraft.I really don't see how this will work.Apart from all the paraphanalia that we carry these days (tickets, books, iPads etc) what about things bought at the airport? Might as well close all the shops if you aren't allowed to take anything with you.I wonder whether it will just be a ban on using the overhead lockers? The amount of time some people spend putting their massive bags up there always causes queues and people crowding.Can't see Mrs H being deprived of her handbag!"
"HOlidaymaker - Yes, I think it is just a ban on the use of overhead lockers. I read this somewhere else.Perhaps airlines consider that it is easier to be socially distanced at the airport carousel rather than have a plane load of passengers trying to retrieve luggage from lockers . One could also argue that it is 'penny pinching' on the part of the airlines."
