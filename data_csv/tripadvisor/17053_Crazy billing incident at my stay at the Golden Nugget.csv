"I had reservations for a comp room on Monday at the Nugget. On Sunday I called sometime after 1 to see if any comps had become available. I figured that would give me all day to relax by the pool and get a spa treatment before my friend arrived in early evening. This was last minute and not one person knew that I was heading down to AC on Sunday. When I went to check out today I noticed a 40 dollar charge from the Deck on my bill. I never went to the Deck! These things have happened before at hotels. Usually you go down there and they just strike it from your bill. Not at the Nugget. I had to wait for 15 minutes for them to get the receipt faxed over from the Deck. When it finally did the woman asked me if I knew someone named Rodney. I don't. Then she went to get the manager. I don't know why the woman brought up a Rodney. Somebody printed my name on the receipt! My name isn't unusual, but it's not typical. I told her that I had no idea why my name was on the check. She told me that maybe somebody I knew did it, but nobody knew I was coming to AC on Sunday. Plus there is NO one in my life that would do something like that. I said perhaps the system was compromised on their end and she immediately dismissed me. She demanded to see my ID even though I wasn't denying that my name was on that receipt. I just don't know how it got there! The manager told me because my name was on the check she was going to bill me for it. If that would of happened I would of called Amex and told them to stop the payment. Finally I looked at the time on the check. It was 1:20 PM on Sunday. I didn't check in until 7PM and I don't even know if I had made the reservation at that point! She must of looked at the time I checked in because she told the woman originally helping me to take it off the bill. Then the manager looked at me and said ""haven't we had this problem with you before?"" NO. They have not. I felt like I was being accused of something. I understand it was an unusual situation, but I've stayed at the hotel multiple times this summer and have racked up nearly 7000 tier points since July first. Why on earth would I lie over a 40 dollar bill? She was rude and I received no apology or anything. Customer service at GN is a nightmare. If you ever have a problem, watch out because they will handle it in the most inept and rudest manner possible. I was given a dirty room once, then the replacement was as downgrade, then they gave me a smoking room. I complained about that incident and got a Saturday room comp. I did visit them numerous times after that but I think after this I'm done. My family has a boat they bring to the Marina and sometimes I will stay while they are there. Summer is over and I think my time at GN is too. Permanently. I gave them another chance and they failed.I'm really concerned about how somebody knew I was staying at the Nugget and who used my name there. They refused to look into it on their end."
"No one should be able to charge something to your room without the little slip of paper with your name and room number they give you when you check in. (Really they shouldn't be able to charge to your room without that and your accompanying ID, but I have seen a lot of casinos be lax about the ID part.)I additionally find it very odd that in a mere 15 minutes they were able to find the receipt in question with your name printed on it. That would entail first getting and then reviewing all the previous day's receipts. Maybe that would be possible if the one in question was on the top of the stack by chance, but I still don't find it likely.Something is very very odd with what went down here. I don't think you need to worry that your identity has been compromised, it sounds more to me like internal people doing something weird because they didn't really want to deal with your situation.I would send an email to GN and ask for clarification about this incident. It sounds like their may be an employee (or employees) doing something dishonest.That being said, I have stayed at GN and been well treated by their bartenders and other staff. But just because some people are good doesn't mean that they all are."
According to your post your name is printed and its not a signature. More importantly its not your signature nor your handwriting either. Call credit card company immediately and file a dispute and chargebck. Explain you did not write your name on receipt and werent even on the premises at the time shown and Im sure after an investigation they will take your side and reverse the charge. You wonthave to pay the $40.
"You bring up some good points. Honestly I was just going to give up on them, but now I would like to know exactly what happened."
Chkndnrwnr-once they saw what time i checked in they struck it from my bill.
"Stayed at gn for the 1st time ever in august, had a lovely room, marina view suite, had a great time. Was issued the slip of paper you are supposed to present when charging anything to the room, had drinks at the pool, lovely. Had dinner at the chart house, excellent, charged both to the room, was not required to show the slip or provide Id, just told them the room number. Had no problems with my bill, had a lovely but losing time at gn, really like what they have done there, but did not have to offer any proof I was who I said I was, just gave the room number"
"If they are lax about the check in slip, then it may have been initially an honest mistake. I once charged a meal back to my room at Ballys aitchy was charged to a different room. (Say 1214 instead of 1414 - their fault not mine, I gave them my room slip). Once I noticed the mistake it took about 30 minutes to be corrected, and that was with me standing in the restaurant that made the error maybe 15 minutes after the error was made. But had I not noticed and the person in the wrongly charged room complained, they would have (eventually) seen a receipt with my signature on it.I still don't understand how the receipt could have been produced so quickly with OP's name printed on it if it were a legit error. Nor do I understand why the manager would have acted so intimidating and accusatory. I would definitely make further inquiries."
"I did email them just now. I don't have issues with them unless there is a problem and they are horrendous in dealing with it. If you read the reviews on their page they don't seem to know how to effectively deal with complaints. In the previous issue with them I was even treated rudely by the head of the hotel. My family spends a lot of time in the marina so I do end up there, but honestly it's not even worth it at this point. I do like GN and like all the improvements but I'm not expecting any great resolution to this."
I think if you sent the email to Tom P the general manager the bill will be resolved. I had a $32 bill for Michael Patrick on the tab last spring on check out and the desk called MP and withing minutes the charge was dropped.We stay there once a month or more in the fall through spring and our ID is checked at the Chairman Club and most other food places when using comps. Even though some of the managers and wait staff know us by name.Hope it works out for you.
"I've found that customer service is a ""nightmare"" all over AC. It seems like an epidemic to me."
casers doesnt give slip anymore
"Just be happy they are not taking you to court! They really have to get their head around dealing with people!We have had situations where we've checked in Harrahs and upon getting to the room there have been charges already on the TV account and a quick phone call was all it took to get them removed.Jim, I was going to say that Harrahs does not give the charge slips any more. Seems very strange to me and probably will lead to more issues. I really don;t understand the issue from the hotel's side, but the last 3 times we've been there, no slips. Of course, that was also the first 3 tyimes we haven't been LFB or RFB in years, so no reason to charge to room!Times they are a changing in AC!!!"
lfb you do
"At harrahs if you use vip checkin you still get a slip. If you go to the desk, they want you to use the bottom of the cardboard thing that hold your keys where it says your name and room number. Odd system"
Stupid in our minds and a system that WILL get abused!
