"Family friends, who will be traveling to WDW this weekend, say they have heard that a virus is going around at the resorts. They've gone so far as to request Rx's from their doctors for Phenergan to take on their trip.While I applaud their effort to ""be prepared"", I'm wondering if this is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to a rumor that may or may not be credible.I have searched the net, and other than a December 11, 2008 report on the disboards about a family who contracted the Norwalk Virus (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) at the Beach Club Resort, I do not see anything to confirm an outbreak at the resorts, though the cruises do seem to have more than their fair share of guests with the virus.We leave in 24 days for our trip and with 3 small children of my own and 2 young nephews (one is an infant), I'm wondering if my family should be worried. Anyone out there who have been to WDW recently and contracted the virus? Any locals who've heard something through the grapevine? Castmembers who've witnessed an outbreak firsthand?Any information, advice, or help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"We were there last of November/first of December; didn't experience any illness and heard nothing of anyone else experiencing any. There are quite a few forum members who have been more recently, some even who are just now returning. Maybe they'll know something. "
"In reality, given the number of people there, odds are that there are at least 5-10 cases per day every single day of the year, but most are probably written off as 'stomach flu' or 'something I ate'. The same would be true of almost any place where large numbers of people gather.Simply washing your hands (antibacterial gel does NOT work well against Norwalk) frequently, especially before eating, will reduce any chances of contagion. And again common sense, if you see someone handle food directly without gloves, take different food."
"If you go onto the DIS boards, they have a rumour section where you could see if anyone has mentioned this. If not, you could always start a new post....That site is run and frequented by Disney fanatics (I mean that in a nice way!) and is also frequented by cast members, so you will more than likely get your answer there. "
"Forgot to say.In the UK it is called the Norovirus, but essentially it's the same. There has been a quite a bit of it in the UK for the last month, although not quite epidemic levels."
"There has been nothing in the local news about this at all... and our local news is slimy, they jump on anything.I watch news every morning, and read the online version every day... have heard nothing.I'd say this is just a rumor.To put it in perspective... someone died after riding tower of terror once... does that mean you won't go on it? "
In the UK a simple way to avoid catching Norwalk is to use hand sanitising gel regularly and especially before you eat.
"I'd worry more about being on the plane and catching a bug than from the resorts. Also many bugs are picked up from pools. We got ill (very ill on one trip to disney and I am sure it was from a very hot pool). As I have a diabetic daughter, and a sickness bug is a nightmare for us to cope with, I now take pool stips with me and if after diping not enough chemical in water I buy and add more , and leave a note for managment company so they do not then add again. This is most important if you have heated the pool. The time we got ill the pool was the same temp as my hot tub in scotland, we were sitting in it over xmas with airtemps of near zero!!"
"I searched Norwalk virus Disney and there was a few claims at Disney for December and early January. They said it was more rampant at, the Beach Club or Yacht Club (Don't quote me as I can't remember exactly). They said in a few weeks it should have run its course and be mostly over. I looked last night after reading this post and now I can't remember the websites I found it on. I was looking mostly into the cruise because my brothers family is going in three weeks.I will look again and if I find them I will post them here."
"Here are the websites that I found the information at. There has been no offical confirmation but people are advised to follow simple precautions:- Frequently wash your hands, especially after toilet visits and changing diapers and before eating or preparing food. - Carefully wash fruits and vegetables, and steam oysters before eating them. - Thoroughly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately after an episode of illness by using a bleach-based household cleaner. - Immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be contaminated with virus after an episode of illness (use hot water and soap). disunplugged.com/2008/…wdwinfo.com/news/Theme_Parks_Attractions/Is_…Hope this helps. Like another said, you can't live your life trying to avoid it. Enjoy your vacation and do your best to follow the above precautions and hopefully, you'll be okay.Have fun and stay healthy!"
"For the person who suggest hand sanitizing gel, that does NOT protect against Norwalk almost at all. Norwalk is a non-lipid virus and alcohol and related based compounds do relatively little.Soap and hot water = best bet."
" I have never heard of this virus. However it sounds like the rhinovirus, which is the flu. This is the time of year for it to be around. I would make sure you all get plenty of rest, this will help your immune system be able to fight it or any other bug. Maybe a vacation is the best medicine:) Have a great trip and stay healthy!!"
" Make that rotavirus- who comes up with these names? Cant they just say sick as a dog, bring a bucket, or sleep in the bathroom?"
Well the hand sanitising gel as used by the UKs FREE NHS sure as hell works over here !
"As you can see this was posed back in December nothing reported now.Posted on Monday, 22nd December 2008 by Pete WernerNorwalk Virus - Two words that no traveler wants to hear. The virus is characterized by “nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur. Symptoms may persist for several days and may become life-threatening in the young, the elderly, and the immune-compromised if dehydration is ignored or not treated.”The most common outbreaks of Norwalk Virus have been reported on Cruise ships in recent years, but several reports on our discusion boards (DISBoards.com), seem to indicate that an outbreak might be happening at Walt Disney World. (CLICK Here for more info)DISBoards.com visitor ‘EpcotBeauty’ posted “It took my family out one by one during our 8 night stay. It came on viciously and violently. It started out with nausea and then forceful vomiting and diarrhea for about 8 hours. It was so bad that all of us had accidents and could not make it to the bathroom (to vomit) at least a few times. The staff at the YC (Yacht Club) and BC (Beach Club) were wonderful and told us that they and SSR (Saratoga Springs Resort) had been hit the hardest. There were literally guests puking outside of the resort, in the food courts and bathrooms!”Several other site visitors are reporting that while they were on vacation, or shortly after arriving home, they became ill with symptoms similar to those attributed to Norwalk.There have not been any official reports to confirm a Norwalk outbreak as of yet, but anyone traveling in the next few weeks is advised to take some simple precautions to help avoid catching the virus.The Center for Disease Control recommends the following:- Frequently wash your hands, especially after toilet visits and changing diapers and before eating or preparing food.- Carefully wash fruits and vegetables, and steam oysters before eating them.- Thoroughly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately after an episode of illness by using a bleach-based household cleaner.- Immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be contaminated with virus after an episode of illness (use hot water and soap)."

"brnzmag im really sorry to hear that ,we have a outbreak here on our Island its hit the junior schools ."
Just got back from WDW. My 3 yr old daughter and my 9 mos old twins girls all had it. For about 5 days. we spent 4 days of our vacation holed up in the hotel room. We were there 5/9 - 5/14 2009.
Did the Doctor say it was indeed The Norwalk Virus ?
"PS mrkeo, I am truely sorry the kids were ill. Been there, done that. Son spent all but 2 days in Bed one year. We were Lucky and could at least see the Magic Kingdom Fireworks every night :)"
"Our doctor called it a virus, but could not give it a name. But the symptoms were all there. Painfully so. At one point my wife and I just had to laugh because we were both on our 3rd wardrobe change for the day as were the kids. Just a messy messy affair. "
Hope you had at least some Fun Time before or afterHope the kids are loads better now It will be a Holiday you won't Forget :)
