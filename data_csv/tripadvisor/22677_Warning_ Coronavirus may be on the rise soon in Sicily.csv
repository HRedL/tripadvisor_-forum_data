"For anyone planning to travel Sicily in the following weeks and months, keep in mind that Sicily is currently struggling with a wave of illigal immigration from Africa.Many of them are infected and don't care about the quarantaine. ""Italy sends military to Sicily as hundreds of migrants flee quarantine""https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/28/coronavi…What I would do is flying to another part of Italy(Rome, Naples, Lamezia Terme) and have a plan B.If Sicily will be fine to travel go along with your original plan, if not cancel your accommodations and travel to another part of Italy.Edited: 4:37 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Omitted from this thread is that most were found, and all had tested negative for coronavirus.Really Tunisia's cornavirus rate is low, ranked 135 worldwide, and with rates far lower than countries permitted to travel to Italy now.As if tourists might not potentially bring coronavirus. Vagabonda"
"""most were found, and all had tested negative for coronavirus.""That's what I'd recommend to tell the public too if I were the public relations advisor for the Italian minister of Interior Affairs. ;-)""Tunisia's cornavirus rate is low""No testing, no virus. Simples.OK, Tunisia is a fairly developed country, but I doubt they can test illegal immigrants. And how much testing is done in Libya while there is a war raging?Not to mention that we do remember cases not that long ago when it was admitted that migrants had COVID.https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/25588/c…https://www.france24.com/en/20200702-migrant…With clandestine immigrants arriving to Sicily all the time each day may bring new surprises regarding COVID. It's like Russian roulette.Don't get me wrong! I don't want to discourage anyone from travelling to Sicily(in fact I'd love to travel there too), but in these times(and at all times) it is important to be well informed in case you have to suddenly amend your plan. It's better to be prapared and simply travel to another part of Italy instead of having to cancel your trip altogether."
Of course it's important to be informed.Just a reminder that Sicily had one of the lowest coronavirus rates in Italy.This thread is more about migrants than virus.Vagabonda
Let's hope it stays like that!
"Rather than spreading misinformation, its better to look at the facts. The actual figures are easily available: There are as of today 206 positive for Covid in the whole of Sicily, of which 2 people in intensive care, and 29 in hospital and 175 in quarantine. Some of these are migrants, most are Italians."

"I'm not spreading misinformation. You seem to speak English at least as well as me and you perfectly understand the meaning of ""may""(it's not Maggio).I suggest to put this discussion to the rest for a while and we'll come back on the 20th August and have a look at the new figures. I'll be more than happy to hear if my warning was over the top and infection remains low."

"The entire OP is misinformation and personal opinion. **For anyone planning to travel Sicily in the following weeks and months, keep in mind that Sicily is currently struggling with a wave of illigal immigration from Africa.Many of them are infected and don't care about the quarantaine.**As has been noted by Vagabonda, most of the immigrants have been detained and none tested positive. This is nothing but fear mongering at it's best.Donna"
Misinformation: all the migrants are obliged to make the covid test. Only a very few of them have been positive.
Thank you for the reply. We have a villa near Savoca from 11-25 Sep. Looking forward as we had a lovely stay last year.
Our OP has been banned multiple times on multiple forums for racist comments. His primary hang ups seem to be about stirring up fear about Non-western immigration. High time he got banned again. Just report him.
"Seems like Malta was a hotbed of Covid cases, with beach and party crowds, that were now brought back by the young Italians who took group trips there.https:/…"
"""Many of them are infected and don't care about the quarantaine.""I don't see any Maggio here. Is this more of a January statement?"

"By the way, what's the scaremongering about Tunisia? I have friends who spend half a year in Tunisia each year.https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…...from July 1, all restrictions on travel to Italy will be lifted with regard to the residents of the following Countries (unless they come from Countries travel from which to Italy is temporarily banned): Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay. In these cases the reasons for travelling will no longer have to be provided;Vagabonda"
