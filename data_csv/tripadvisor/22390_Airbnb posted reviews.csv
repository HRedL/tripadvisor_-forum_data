"Can anyone tell me about the Airbnb posted reviews? We trusted the reviews posted for a studio in Hawaii. We got there and the place was dirty. So much that we left after 2 days and lost $800. They had good reviews! Does the host edit reviews...or write them?Lovin Hawaii, but bummed re Airbnb."
"I've never used Airbnb but know there are many dozens of topics on them across many TripAdvisor forums. Some people have good experiences, some don't. Standards seem to vary a lot. Scroll up and use the search box just above your question, type in Airbnb, and from the drop-down menu choose to search ""All Forums"". Then you can read how other people felt about their Airbnb experience, and whether the online reviews about the property matched the reality."
Thank you!
"There are problems with reviews. Firstly they will be subjective anyway. Some people's ideas of cleanliness will be very different to mine, for example!Secondly, there will always be reviews that are not real. They could be positive reviews churned out by relatives and friends of the business, or even by people who are paid to write them.I don't know enough about AirBnB or the reviews for such places. I've never used them and have no intention of doing so. But as what I've written applies to all other types of reviews, I can't really see AirBnB reviews being better controlled or policed, really."
"IF you are talking about the reviews on the actual AirBnB site, yes, I expect them to be skewed. I would expect the reviewer to have to conform to posting guidelines and if not, the owner can request to have them removed - somewhat like the reviews here. In my opinion - it always pays to find reviews from multiple sources and websites. There are some here in TripAdvisor, as well."
"I'm an Airbnb host in Washington DC and have had great reviews. I work hard to provide a beautiful home and garden with lovely amenities, including a great continental breakfast. Reviews can only be left by paid guests and cannot be edited by hosts. As with Trip Advisor, the host can respond to reviews once they are left. The host forum indicates that reviews considered to be unfair are left as is (except in very rare occasions). The guests are also reviewed by the hosts."
"Appreciate the replies. We thought Airbnb to be a great, person to person service...like Uber and we trusted the reviews. We are not clean freaks :) and have stayed in many places in the US and abroad. I'm not sure what happened. We won't use Airbnb again and, as advised, will use a variety of sources for research."
"Rather than lose $800, I would hsve bought some cleaning stuff and done it myself!"
"We attempted to do that but realized it was going to take more than spray bleach cleaner and paper towels. Oh well, lesson learned."
"what an indictment of airbnb's protocols that allow hosts to cancel bookings at short notice. a travesty and failing that has cost this traveller a whole lot of money, time and wasted effort.90% of my confirmed bookings and/or requests have been declined rejected or cancelledairbnb obviously doesn’t work for meso frustrating the wasted time and effort!!all airbnb does besides the legal refund is offer a coupon for the next failed booking ????!!!surely these cancellations constitute breaches of contract?Edited: 4 years ago "
"Yes, but you agreed to their T&C's (excuse the caps, as this section of the T&C's on their site is all in caps)""YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT AIRBNB IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN HOSTS AND GUESTS, NOR IS AIRBNB A REAL ESTATE BROKER, AGENT OR INSURER. AIRBNB HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF HOSTS, GUESTS AND OTHER USERS OF THE SITE""And again here;""The Hosts, not Airbnb, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services""To be fair to AirBnB, their T&C's are no different from OTA platforms that offer hotel reservations. Hotels can do exactly the same things."
The good part about Air BnB compared to some other rental sites is that the money a guest pays is held by Air BnB until the guest is actually in the rental. No one gets paid beforehand so that if you get canceled you can get your money back or use it for another rental.I prefer hotels myself but my adult children use Air BnB a lot and seem very satisfied with their experiences.
"We have used AirBnB extensively in the past, but unfortunately they have ""dropped the ball"".They allow misleading advertisements and do not vet what hosts advertise.Parking on site means up to 2 kms away on street if you are lucky !!We are currently in Oristano Italy in a tiny cramped room, nothing like what was advertised !AirBnB are slack in not checking what is advertised on their site and you need to question in detail before booking."
">>>They allow misleading advertisements and do not vet what hosts advertise<<<I'm neither here nor there about AirBnB, but that issue isn't exclusive to just AirBnB. Even the largest online agents are caught out with those issues. They simply cannot go around verifying/vetting each listing with an inspection. It's unfortunate but also unrealistic, because they act as a listing agent, not a management group. And just like other OTA's, rely heavily on information provided by the supplierEdited: 4 years ago "
"Here what you are saying, having used them as a ""Booking Agent"" over a number of years, this trip we are seeing the flaws significantly in what they allow to be listed.There are a number of sites exposing the risks arising in using them as a booking agent without proper diligence in the pre booking phase.AirBnB is a classic example of ""Caveat Emptor"" !!How hard is it for AirBnB to get a lister to prove ""on site parking"" means on the property, not some distance away on the street if you can find a parking spot with all the residents in the neighbourhood looking for a spot also.A booking agent does have a responsibility to ensure what they are promoting is correct, and I'm more than happy to test that in a court."
"<and I'm more than happy to test that in a court.>Please do so and come back with your report. As an aside, be sure to carefully review the Terms & Conditions, which I'm thinking allow AirBnB (and many other 3rd party listing OTA's) to do this legally."
"I don't use AirBnB myself, but as an interested observer it seems to me as though they have grown so much that more people are aware of them and are now prepared to use the site in a less than honest manner. At the same time, as KVE has said, it becomes increasingly unrealistic for them to do any checks on the information that they are being provided with. This can result in a clear impression that their standards are declining or that they have dropped the ball.Like bk_t1, I look forward to hearing how your court case goes. I'd be amazed if they haven't covered themselves legally, and even if they haven't, it would probably have been discovered long before now."
"I am currently resolving a dispute at the moment, and in the end brand protection seems to be coming to the surface rather than a public stoush !You need to stand up and take on the challenge. Consumers are not mugs, and social media quickly and effectively brings a reality check to poor standards."
"We were the original post for this thread. When we arrived at our Airbnb in Hawaii, we found the posting photos and the previous reviews were not accurate (still don't know how/who posted the good reviews). We made the mistake of trying to stay. After 2 days and trying to do some cleaning, we left. We should have immediately notified Airbnb upon arrival. Lesson learned...we did get a partial refund, but lost about $800. Its unfortunate.Airbnb is such a great concept, but there is no or minimal quality control. We traveled a long distance for our vacation trusting the reviews and photos. We will not use this service again."
">>>As an aside, be sure to carefully review the Terms & Conditions, which I'm thinking allow AirBnB (and many other 3rd party listing OTA's) to do this legally<<<I agree BK.AirBnB Terms & Conditions;""AirBnB cannot and does not control the content contained in any listings and the condition, legality or suitability of any accommodations. AirBnB is not responsible for and disclaims any and all liability related to any and all listings and accommodations. Accordingly, any bookings will be made or accepted at the members own risk"""
"Too many misconceptions about what airBnB is and how it works - the fact someone called it a Booking Agency, even in inverted commas, says it all. It is not. It puts renters directly in contact with owners and offers a payment platform to stop owners disappearing with the money or renters not turning up and leaving the owner with a vacant property that is not now earning money. The quality control? User reviews! If you aren't happy with something score the property accordingly and say in the review what you didn't like!"
"Wirewiper....that was my original question starting this thread in January The place we booked had great, current reviews. When we arrived, we found the reviews were not at all accurate. My original question was...who writes the reviews?Can a host post/change reviews?"
Have you actually posted a review yet? Hosts don't change reviews (but they can ask for them to be removed if they contravene airBnB policy).Hosts do also have a right to reply.
"I know things can get complicated with many such policies, but here is the AirBnB review policy. I would expect anything which falls outside of these rules, would be tagged to delete - just like TA has similar rules for its reviews.https:/…what-are-airbnb-s-review-guidelines"
Yes we did post a review. It did not appear because the host withdrew their lodging.

Post #25 reported as advertising.
It's a scam the company has No credibility-They debited my account and cancelled the property next day(as I found out happened to heaps of people)Was fully scammed on the second property and loss $5000AUS and Airbnb wouldn't help.WAY TOO RISKY dealing with them and then you have to risk the property is as says.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Unfortunately your anger is causing you to rant and that is making your message incoherent.Take a deep breath, count to ten and tell us what actually happened with airBnB to cause you to lose $5000AUS."
"I am no fan of AirBnB myself, but wirewiper is right. Please try and explain what happened and what the issue or issues are. It could be very helpful to others if you do."
"I have used airbnb on and off over the past 2 years. Trips to Denmark Spain and also in the UK only had 1 bad experience when the listing was as not as it said meaning no window the bedroom. I called them up and after around an hour they agree with me and refunded my payment. I had not yet travelled to the destination. They are some horror storys with airbnb for sure but the same holds true for hotel booking sites etc ..its a personal choice for sure but for me getting to meet people in the heart of a city - can make all the difference. Sometimes I want the privacy of a hotel room sometimes not depends on my mood. Its not linked totally to my budget.With airbnb always read the reviews - sure these could be scammed but you can only leave a review after a paid booking has been complete. Make sure that the person on the listing has all verification - id-phone-facebook - address and so on.I never book with any of the verification missing. I personally also never book a place with a property / room that is newly listed. I look for a history.Then finally I do a google on the place which can throw up comments on various forums if something really bad as happened. Maybe i just got lucky I dont know but so far my experiences have all be positive. And like anything you get what you pay for! My last but 1 trip to Spain the place was incredible - own room, bathroom balcony ,wifi and tv whole place was spotless - the lady who owned the place totally accommodating and left me to use the entire place the whole time. Only one the messed up here was me - I took her tv remote control by mistake ;-) but did post it back out to her.I will continue to use them, but continue to be do as much back ground checks as I can before I make my choice."
"Not sure it's worth it. From here on out, I think I'll stick with hotels with high reviews on trip advisor. Air Bnb's are inconsistent, you pay cleaning fees but are expected to take out trash, you're chastised for having a small entertainment which is the whole point of having an apartment versus a hotel room to be able to socialize a little. There's no toiletries so you have to buy that yourself too. sometimes you're made to feel like an awkward guest in someone's primary residence. The final straw for me is a host that literally called us names and accosted our personality due to a mixup. Not worth it! I'll stick with plain old good customer service."
"For anyone curious about using Airbnb, consider this. I've tried a few times to stay at a hosts place and failed. I've had hosts not contact me or confirm within 24 hours....Do I make new plans? Beware before you fit confirm! I understand not all host are the same, some are great.....just like guests. Recently, Hurricane Mathew ruined my weekend in Charleston S.C., my host was being evacuated, so she had no problem refunding my money. She was actually great, she kept me informed every few hours about the storm, because I still wanted to go! I got most of my money back, but even under these circumstances Airbnb would not refund their cut! ($70) And the worst part, if you have a problem with Airbnb, you will not find a phone # or email to contact them any where on their site. Just try. So, after multiple tries to use this money saving, fantastic new service, I will go back to Kayak and travelocity for a hotel, that would refund all my money if there are Extenuating Circumstances, like Airbnb would say. No stars, F graded, zero in my book.Robert"

"Got to the place we had to stay in Black Forest in Germany and place was sold. No one had the decency to let us know. Couldnt reach AirBNB or host. Just no answer. On AirBnB website even less help.Here we are in the middle of nowhere with no place to stay. Thank God we got a place to sleep in town further on. Offcourse had to pay again, because we already paid AirBnB.Came home. Tried to get our money back. Many stories later. Still nothing. Not even replies on our emails.So, so, so unprofessional, devious, greedy, flawed, disappointing, unreliable and no integrity at all."
"Airbnb reviews are better than most because you are REQUIRED to have stayed in the rental to post a review. This said, the standards vary and one man's barn is another man's castle.I have had the same problems on Trip Advisor. Great reviews for an All Inclusive place in Puerto Vallarta and was very frustrated with room smells, basic fixtures not functioning, and general hotel dereliction."
I have used many VRBO places and (so far) every time it was exactly as described online.Sometimes slightly even better.
"I have had a very mixed experience with Airbnb. Airbnb cancelled one of my reservations in Hawaii abruptly, with little notice. The owner actually contacted me to explain (Oahu is in a battle to stop short-term rentals-- neighbors informed whoever it is responsible for 'policing'), but Airbnb did not. The replacement that I found was REALLY tiny (not well described, as in, you can't move in the bedroom, only hop on the bed) and had ants (mentioned in passing, but this was more than passing). I have tried to reserve several other places in several locations, with no response. That being said, sometimes you just have no alternative. I just got back from New Zealand and ALL hotels were booked (concert drawing large numbers of people and not enough hotel capacity). I found two absolutely beautiful places, water views and the whole experience was fantastic. Now for the original question-- can you believe the reviews? I review a lot on TripAdvisor and try to give details (honest--good and bad) to just forearm the next guest but I personally have felt intimidated by the Airbnb situation: the hosts get to review YOU. That means your chances of booking other places might be affected Hotels can't prevent you from staying in another hotel because they didn't like your review. However, hosts can black mark you if they want. It's a reasonable idea for the Airbnb hosts to protect themselves-- perfectly understandable--- but I believe this does affect the quality of the review. I think you have to read each review critically, as you would on any review site and make a considered judgement...."

"CArTRLVR,You have touched on another issue with airbnb. If it's not legal in Oahu as in the case in some other locations too, you took a lot of risk in booking. Many people report checking the local laws before booking to avoid last minute cancellations and other problems."

Very disappointed in the property we used. Airbnb did not seem interested in all that the property was misrepresented even though we had pictures to prove it. I am going back to VRBO
"I know exactly how you feel, I rented ""Sea La Vie"" in Cape Canaveral Florida hosted by Jan. I paid 450.00 dollars for 5 days. It wasn't actually as discribed but it was ok. I got back the second night late and exhausted having had several appointments that day. Went to bed got up in the middle of the night for water and what do I find in the kitchen.....yes your right Cockroaches!!!! I managed to get though until morning contacted my host and the response I got was well they come in because its hot in Florida. Really! I told her I was leaving immediately and she tried to tell me she would have someone come and spray. I just couldn't believe it. I packed up and left. Contacted her several times for half my fee to be refunded. I strayed two nights thought that was fair. I had no response. Contacted Corporate at Airbnb and their response is you need documentation. So for all my fellow travelers that want to use Airbnb make sure if the condo or home your staying in has Cockroaches that you follow them around with your phone and take pictures. Maybe Airbnb will support you. I will go back to the Hilton. Thank you for allowing me to speak my peace."
"I host on Airbnb. If I can give you guys any advice, I would say to ALWAYS pick properties under a SUPERHOST. In order to qualify for this badge as a host, you need to have 5 stars reviews 80% of the time and communicate back to guests within the hour and never cancel on anyone. Superhosts are also highly committed to their business so you get the highest service possible on Airbnb. I highly doubt you will get a dirty rental with a Superhost. Good luck ;)"
"Guess what? I did use that advice and she was listed as a super host, I thought all was good. I will not use Airbnb again, they have ignored the issues I have had with this host. I have had to dispute this charge with my credit card company because not either the host ( which admitted there were bugs) or the company will do anything to resolve this. The company thinks I should have chased the roaches around the house and taken pictures. So so sad..."
"I understand your disgust and I would have been freaked out myself. However, you should also know that my room at the Rosen Center in Orlando, FLA also had a couple of roaches passing on top of the TV. $150 / nite! I also saw quite a few on my walk to the convention center...It does not excuse you not getting helped, however it sounds like roaches are highly prevalent there."

I am so sorry you guests that thought it was appropriate to damage your property. How awful for you. I am happy to hear you are no longer hosting. Airbnb does not back up their hosts or guest. Not a company that should be in service of the public. I am saddened by all the stories I read about them. I am thankful I am out of it.
"There is a con to everything, I've had some wonderful experiences with Aribnb and it delivered as promised. I believe it's a little bit on luck as well. The percentage of Airbnb disappointing you would be negligible. Try it out one more time and let me know."
"I tried Airbnb three times the first was fabulous. The other two not so good. I have one more in May I could not cancel, strict cancellation policy and I would have lost a ton of money so I am stuck with it. That is another thing That bothers me I can cancel the Hilton a day before and get all my money back, if you have an Airbnb you are going to lose money and sometimes a lot of money. I am going to keep my fingers crossed and have an open mind for my last condo. But irregardless I am finished gambling with my money and the people at Airbnb. Good luck to you."
"I have had this same problem with several places and, when I wrote negative reviews myself about these places, they were not posted. This is one of several major issues I have had with this company and I will not be using them again. Airbnb is not a reputable company and I would not trust them."
">>> another thing That bothers me I can cancel the Hilton a day before and get all my money back, if you have an Airbnb you are going to lose money and sometimes a lot of money. <<<That's a Hilton! That's one bed out of the millions they sell every night, your payment is just a drop in the ocean.Somebody letting out an apartment on the other hand, has that let unavailable for someone else to rent out whilst you have a reservation hold on it, and if you turn round and cancel the day before that owner is left with a vacancy they are unlikely to fill, so THEY lose money - ALL the money.That is why - quite rightly - holiday lets operate under different terms and conditions. And if the owner wants to set a strict cancellation policy, that is their business. If you don;t agree with the cancellation policy - don't book.To be honest, I think this idea of booking several places and cancelling the ones you don't want the day before has gone too far, and it is not appropriate behaviour in the holiday letting sector.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I think you misunderstood...what I said was I have the option! I didn't say I use it. I realize the conditions that the host at Airbnb have to work with and I appreciate that, I also understand their right to strict cancellations. However that being said I do not understand being lied to about the area or condition the rental is in. What I meant by using the Hilton is its always consistent. I cannot and will not gamble with my money with Airbnb. Thanks for your comment."
I have a young family and we had a horrible experience they cancelled a reservation just prior to our vacation and then had us go to a similar townhome in san diego. The home had spiders and cob webs along with half naked pictures of women and homeless people sleeping outside. We were told by the customer service that we would be taken care of and we should leave and get a hotel. Well 3 weeks later and being overly friendly to them they just kept telling us they would call us tomorrow about 15 times and they would put you on hold and accidently hang up 10 times. They have a strong ignore you and maybe you'll go away policy. No way would I stay with them the renter in san diego was bad but AirBNB is 20 times worse.
"I have had a bad experience with Airbnb. Place I rented was misrepresented. Very far from center of town when listing said 5 minutes.We were going to stay 5 days, left after 1 night. Place also had ants, no soap or any paper towels, napkins or TPFurniture and mattress were awful. When I left early and complained,they blocked me from leaving a review. Ill never again book with them. Stay at a hotel, just as cheap and much better places to stay"
Thats exactly what they do. We had bad experience and were blocked from leaving a review
Airbnb charges a sizable fee for this service and they should see its fair if a host lies in there representation of place. I have stayed in many many hotels all over the world and never had a problem. If they honor agreement. I used airbnb 2 times and totally taken advantage of
"I feel your pain...I will never use again! Remember if you pay with a major credit card, the card company has a guarantee if not satisfied. After the host and Airbnb refused to speak with me I canceled the payment. All my money was refunded. Stay in a hotel it's a no brainer."
"I would advise you to be very careful before using airbnb . View cancellation policy , pictures , amenities and pricing . Pls check that with neighboring hotels - advantage with staying in hotels is - they are able to maintain standards , they have camera at from entrance ( at minimum ) to keep muggers and bad elements away . Also cancellation policy of hotels is more straightforward . I have had a wonderful experience and a terrible one where I overpaid for lousy accommodation by 200 dollars . The reviews are not that reliable , you have to go with your instinct by looking at pictures and doing comparative study . My advice is to not fall for cheap accommodation ..look for safety and reliability . I would look for the hotels around ( days inn / extended stay etc) provide better amenities and price and customer service and choose them over airbnb ."
My friend has been doing AirBnb for around 4 months in South of England - she is doing really well with it and has some great reviews. if its run properly it can really work out well. Personally I never had any real issues and have used it in a number of Countrys but each to there own. We have booked an entire apartment in Alicante for 2 weeks next month. Came highly recommended from a friend who used it ... but with careful planning it can work out really well.
"AirBnB is a giant scam. BEWARE. Their customer service sucks (both as a host and as a guest). But that is only the tip of their iceberg.Hosts (especially) should use VRBO or other vacation rental resources, and travelers/guests are advised to do likewise.AirBnB claims to verify their renting guests, and puts many hurdles in the way of hosts trying to require potential guests to fully identify themselves. Only owners/hosts who own flea bag properties would allow any damn schmoe to take possession of their property without providing full ID: SSN, Drivers License, DOB, full name, mailing address, etc., and permission to run a credit check. Maybe that is why so many AirBnB properties ARE flea bags.We have properties worth over $1 Million with valuable furnishings, artworks, etc. NO WAY are we going to give the keys to someone AirBnB will not let US verify. I am a Realtor and attorney, and I can tell you horror stories when owners do not fully vet guests themselves. HORROR STORIES!We recently tried to check on one ""verified"" guest, only to find that their cell phone was really someone else's (same first name, but different last name and no idea who the ""guest"" was), and no other info AirBnB gave us access to checked out either. We tried several ways of contacting the booking guest but only got one reply -- through AirBnB's anonymous contact email, which was written clearly by a non-native English speaker (even though their name was listed as ""John Smith"" -- I am using a pseudonym here, do not want to implicate anyone directly). I am guessing they were Eastern Bloc scammers who had cased our AirBnB listing through the pictures, booked for a weekend, and planned to simply rob the entire place during their stay. GET THIS: When I called AirBnB to report my reasons for thinking this was a scam and cancelling the reservation, they penalized ME (!) and said I was being unreasonable in the info I was requesting from the guest EVEN THOUGH MY LISTING CLEARLY STATED THAT I REQUIRE THAT INFO FROM ALL GUESTS! (VRBO has no problem with me getting full verification and ID from booking guests). AirBnB's claims they have a $1 million dollar insurance policy on each rental. GREAT! So, when the bandits steal all the valuables, I THEN get to argue with a third party insurer who has NO relationship or loyalty to me (only to AirBnB, their real client), PROVE my losses to THEIR satisfaction, and HOPE that I am ultimately made whole (of course, AFTER coming out of pocket for 6 to 12 months to re-furnish the property, not to mention trying to replace irreplaceable artworks -- which I enjoy sharing with my otherwise respectable, and fully vetted, guests). Any legitimate business model would give paramount importance to securing the person and property of the owners/hosts. Any hotel around the world will make you show positive ID (passport, credit card, etc.) for EVERY GUEST before renting you a room. Only AirBnB thinks it can bully owners (increasingly sleazy slumlords and fly-by-night ""re-renters"" who have NO real connection to the properties or neighborhoods they have on offer) into rolling the dice on any jackass who can present a credit card with a limit equal to a few nights rent (then stealing or damaging 5, 10 or 100 times that amount).As Disney's Pirates repeat: "" 'No fear of evil curses', says you? 'Properly warned', says I""."
"This is the problem with Airbnb reviews: the hosts get to review the guests too, so people are afraid of giving bad reviews. For our first Airbnb stay, we wanted a good review as guests so we gave an excellent review(although TBF, it was pretty great). Hosts look at guests' reviews too. Read the reviews; don't just look at the number of stars. There are often coded messages. Contact the host with a couple of quick questions before booking and see how quickly and thoroughly they reply. Airbnb takes a LOT more work than a hotel but totally worth it. We have stayed in them for the last year and have had generally great places. Research the sh!t out of it. If you get an iffy feeling don't go. If all this work bothers you, stay in a hotel."
"We had a terrible experience at the house we stayed at. The rental was $ 1800 for 2 days and a no smoking, no pets house. The owners are smokers and they had pets. The house was disgusting. I also have over $ 6800 in fraudulent charges that AIRBNB indicated that their system was hacked. Avoid AIRBNB"
I agree. We are having the same experience in Hamilton Ontario. The reviews were glowing. The house not so much.
"I'm in the process of using AirBNB for the first time and already I hate them! I was offered a ""special offer"" discount by the host. I accepted, entered my CC#, took screen shots of the transaction, only to have Air BnB do a bait & switch and charge me MORE for the reservation. I contact host and AirBNB. I speak to a guy named ""Arryon"" at Customer Service. He says that I changed the dates so the special offer didn't apply. I did not and could prove it. He asked me to send screen shots. I did and he said he didn't get them. I said that I have now spent hours on this - why can't he just look at the special offer, and look at what I booked and give me my money back instead of making my life hell? Nope. He said he would call me the next day. Right. I'm going to write on every site I can to warn people that Air BnB will over charge their credit cards after you accept a booking. Not cool."
"I do not advise using Airbnb. Twice this year I had owners tell me at the last minute I could not have the rental promised to me months before. In both cases Airbnb staff were non apologetic. I did receive a full refund, but I had to scramble and was able to to only find new places in less desirable locations for more money. After lots of communication back and forth Airbnb did give me a small amount of money back as a rebate, but I won't be using them again in the future."
"aweful #Airbnb stayFirst and last time I try Airbnb. I used this traveling and accomodation app to reserved an apartment in London. Fully paid in advance. Once we arrived at the flat we relized the place was different from the pictures: dust everywhere, broken and super old furniture, a dangerous upper window that seems close to fall off any time soon, dirty bed sheets. The linens for the sofa bed were stored inside a broken drawer, all balled up together with wet towels. We could not sit on the toilet cause it was broken and about to fall into pieces very soon.And this is just a summary, but there would be much more to tell.I called Airbnb help desk 5 times in 2 days, they just offered to help me find another apartment but of course there was not availability within the same day. The second day I managed to find another accomodation, paying a lot, for the last 2 nights (the total stay was 4 nights). I called the support team to ask for a refund of the last 2 nights and, after a hour on the phone and 10 emails, they told me they would let me know by the end of the day, never heard from them. Never use Airbnb, if you are not lucky with the accomodation you are lost, no way to get a refund. Basically Airbnb it's just a listing app, but they are not able to guarantee any further service or protection from rip offs. The owner of the apartment is Cornelio and the place is in Scoreditch, 1 Great Eastern Street, London."
"Airbnb is TERRIBLE for many reason, but here is a perfect example of how they make sure their reviews stay sparkly HIDING the truth: If you book a place for a week ANYWHERE, but imagine some place outside your resident country, and you arrive and find the place you paid good money for is roach infested and smells of overpowering urine, or even find chalk body outlines on the floor, and you tell the HOST these issues they can simply cancel your reservation, refund your money, and BOOM, their reputation stays intact because YOU CANNOT LEAVE A REVIEW! No reviews for cancelling on you after arrival if they refund your money.The only way to leave a review is IF YOU STAY IN THE ROACH INFESTED PLACE, indeed, not until your reservation is COMPLETE can you leave a review. If your host cancels on you and strands you in some strange city, NO REVIEW. Airbnb are a smart company, people do not think to check reviews on websites FOR the company, I didn't. I simply read the reviews on THEIR SITE. If you check reviews for AIRBNB, you'll see you should stay away.I stayed away from any PLACES/HOSTS that had reviews of uncleanliness, etc, but I trusted the reviews, NOT KNOWING the REVIEWS ARE NOT THE FULL PICTURE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LET YOU REVIEW A HOST THAT LEAVES YOU STRANDED IN A STRANGE CITY! Or forces you to leave by refusing to sleep somewhere that smells like a dumpster. Ridiculous, total scam, I hope someone files a class action lawsuit. THEY GET GOOD MONEY for SIMPLY acting as a classified ad service, doing NOTHING to ensure the safety or welfare of the renters. You'd be better off finding someone one-on-one online that rents their place and RELIES on yelp reviews or somesuch. AIRBNB is a scam! Oh, and they offer you HUGE incentives to sucker others into using their service. Anyone you dislike--Recommend airbnb to them!"
I have found the reviews to be useful but of course expectations play a large part. My own reviews on the site were not edited.
"This is such an interesting thread and I wonder if my situation is unique.The only thing I can review is the pre-booking and “Contact host” system which, for me, proved very frustrating.Recently I spent the better part of an afternoon going through the snakes and ladders registration process and after assistance from a very friendly, thorough Customer Service Rep. I was all set.I then spent some time learning about the listing format, maps, pricing etc.So being ready use Airbnb, I set out to find a nice suitable 4 day stay, at a specific location and time.4 requests, 4 failures.Request 1;Immediate reply was a bait and switch as the host was really looking for a month long pet sitter and wanted to meet “off airbnb.”Request 2;No reply and within a few hours the site showed “This listing is no longer available.”Request 3;Quick reply but stated they were changing to longer bookings than the 3 day minimum stated, would be changing their calendar and were denying my request unless I wanted to book longer. More bait and switch? A week later the calendar still shows 3 day min.Request 4;Very similar to 3 above; a quick response, with apologies, for not keeping their calendar up to date. Said current guest would be staying longer than originally planned. This is July and I was looking for time in October. Strange.I find it disturbing, the number of times guests have had bookings cancelled by hosts, sometimes only days before arrival, like alan0721 above. Imagine that chaos.Complaining on the Airbnb “Community Center” will only hurt because it is run by hosts.So, I will not give up yet but so far, I am not impressed."
"In February 2017, reserved an apartment in Puerto Vallarta for last week in December 2017. Reservation was confirmed, purchased airline tickets, made arrangements for all aspects of the trip. Reservation was paid in full at the time of booking and now it's July and we just received notice that our reservation has been cancelled. They will refund the room rent but now we are trying to find a room. Our first and last time to book through Airbnb."
"Personally, I've had great experiences with Airbnb and will continue to use them. My main objective in renting through Airbnb is value. I would be unable to travel as much if I paid for hotel rooms and had to go out to eat for all my meals. I try to be as careful as I can in my selection and keep my expectations moderate. I've stayed in some pretty awful hotel/motels. My recommendation is that if you can afford a nice hotel go for it! Unfortunately, financially I am not in that category.As far as reviews go, after the stay is completed both host and guest receive requests for a review I doubt if you can write a review without completing your reservation. Also, if a host cancels that is noted in the review section. I won't stay at a place that has cancelled.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I used airbnb several times, this past month we were robbed in a place w good reviews, the host wasn't surprised and I learned it's very common there, maybe they use airbnb to attract people, I asked for help( no answer) I left a review to prevent people to suffer the same, they didn't published it( who knows who else did the same), I don't trust airbnb, if they get their fee from a place they couldn't care less about you after that"
"I've been using airbnb for over a year, 11 nights in England, 20 in New Zealand, 1 in Iceland, 19 in Norway. First a hint about reviews. Just like any other reviews on google or yelp, read with a careful eye and weigh the preponderance of evidence. If there are 15 good reviews and one bad, see how the host replied to the complainer.If a ""seller"", and that's what the host is, suggests ""going offline"", disconnect and never go back! Let's face it the host is trying to cheat the company that is providing him with a million dollar website and advertising. If they're willing to cheat them they WILL cheat you.Since my first less than satisfying experience I've tried to always use airbnb SUPERHOSTS. That's a little ribbon posted next to the host's picture. People work hard to get that, I think they need 15 or so top reviews to get that and they go out of their way to get it.Other things being equal go with an OLDER host. Old people, like me expect things to be clean and tidy and will not tolerate dirt or bugs.One place I stayed in in New Zealand had the following problems: About a year's worth of dust and grime on the baseboards. Bathroom sink, and tub were dirty, not just unclean but DIRTY. I only used the shower which was passable. The shower door didn't close properly so water got on the floor with every use. The only electrical outlet in the room was tucked behind a bureau, I had to ask for a power strip, which I think they bought that day while I was out. This place is no longer listed on airbnb.Another place in NZ, near the water, had a lot of open food packages NOT in sealed containers so bugs showed up for breakfast. There were no towels in the bathroom and the shower drain had more than a tiny bit of hair across it. The wifi only worked if you sat on the porch, this was in an outbuilding.I wrote DETAILED bad reviews, like a 2 star, on each of those places. One is no longer listed, the other, with a now 3 star rating is listed at a price about 40% less than it was when I was there.NO host has ever asked me to change a review. The excuses that the one offered were pathetic enough that a child would have laughed at them.On the plus side: A host in NZ cooked steak, baked potato and mushrooms for me, we sat on her back deck and drank 2 1/2 bottles of wine while she did two loads of laundry for me.Another NZ host invited me to join her and some friends for dinner and pub night. We then went to one couple's house for more drinks and coffee. I prefer the company of people to sitting in a sterile hotel room watching TV. I spent my career in sales so I often spent up to 15 nights a month in hotels. Airbnb can save you money, I paid about $45/night in Norway versus about $140/night for hotels. Being able to do laundry while chatting with a host beats going to a coin place or paying outrageous fees for hotel laundry service.I do like saving money but I can well afford to stay anywhere I like. On the NZ and Norway trips I flew business class from the US which is quite a bit more than sitting in coach. I just prefer the ambiance of airbnb."
"MY PARTNER AND I MADE RESERVATION ON AIRBNB, THEY HAVE DEACTIVATED BOTH OUR ACCOUNTS. We both contacted them asking what the problem was. Customer Service could not give an answer and said our accts were being reviewed. This has been going on for 5 days now. TODAY I GOT A EMAIL SAYING (ACCT DEACTIVATED AND DECISION IS FINAL)We have booked more than 6 airbnb rentals with NO PROBLEMS and good reviews-So I am at a loss what is going on. If someone would call us and explain to us the problem, we would be more than HAPPY to answer any questions OR TRY TO FIX IT ON OUR ENDVERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICEANYONE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE, AND WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT"
I just tried airbnb for the first time. Due to a family issue we had to cancel our trip a month out. However we got only 50% back ..so it still costed us $800! As a comparison to cancel the round the world flights on the same trip was $150. So I truly wouldn't bother...book with a hotel or commercial apartments that don't have such ridiculous cancellation policies. They are the worst.
"Sunshine, what did the terms and conditions you signed up to say about cancellations? In my experience (inthe U.K.) it's made quite clear on the opening page of each property eg Moderate, Strict etc. Then it is explained in straightforward language how much is payable/retained in the event of a cancellation. Why not just claim on your travel insurance?"
"BIGGEST SCAM EVER!!! Today I have been scammed by thousands of pounds ! My hard earned cash and no one is accepting responsiblility or helping me. Dont go on the website or make any bookings via airbnb. Tomorrow I was meant to be celebrating my husbands 40th, along with 10 of my close family and friends. And now not only have I had to break it to my husband but I also had to tell my friends and family the money they paid for their accommodation can not be refunded and we have no accommodation. I went onto the air bnb website (which I thought was a well trustworthy site). Having made a couple of enquiries we found what we thought was a perfect villa at a good cost. There was correspondence to and from air bnb. I made payment as the air bnb email requested. And even received confirmation from air bnb. Today I had rang up air bnb to get confirmation of the address and now they are saying they have no record of my booking. They are not telling me what is going on and they haven't even got back to me. So now I'm left thousands out of pocket, no accomadation, and having to cancel my trip. The worst thing of it all is, air bnb have still got the link up for this villa. See below https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/20265536…Everyone please be warned - don't let this be you !! Don't use Air bnb for your travels"

"karankaur2017 @ post 78, if true, this is the most disturbing of all stories here. I say ""if true"" respectfully because we can only go by what you have said.So, in fairness to everyone, please report on results (or none) as this proceeds. I am sorry for your predicament."
"Karankaur,You wrote that you followed the directions in an email to make payment. Did you make payment directly on the airbnb website? There are clear instructions on airbnb to never make any payment except through their website.https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/199/wh…I noticed that the property owner only has one review. It is recent and negative. It is also recommended that you rent from a trusted host who has many positive reviews, not that you will ever use airbnb again, but those are a couple of the mistakes you may have made. It is truly awful to hear stories like this."
"""Did you make payment directly on the airbnb website?""That was my first thought as well."
"karankaur2017:You badly need tangible documentation from them that they have no record of the booking. They can't effectively fight a chargeback claim if they say they never sold you anything. Airbnb holds payment until 24 hours after check-in. They also allow cancellation with refund more than 24 hours before check-in time. And of course, you are now within that 24-hour period. It is not impossible that the host is still expecting you and that there is nothing wrong except whoever you talked to on the telephone couldn't find the booking. If that is the case, they can simply deny anyone told you that, in which case their position would be that you simply failed to show up or cancel in time. And so far, the only written evidence you have supports their position. And, as others have mentioned, if you made payment to any entity but Airbnb, it's more difficult, especially if it was in a poorly protected way, like bank transfer. Hopefully, it was properly made to Airbnb and by credit card, so that a chargeback claim will at least prompt the card issuer to demand proof from Airbnb, and you will see what that is. Start that process right now. Don't let the check-in plus 24-hour time of transfer of payment to the host pass without it. And tell the card issuer all of these things, so they can act before Airbnb losses control of the funds and hardens their position to avoid losing it. I'm not especially hopeful. Credit card issuers and other payment entities cannot simply decide to believe undocumented facts and pull back money. Their contracts with merchants require them to let charges stand if there is evidence the merchant did what they were supposed to do. You're depending on Airbnb to provide evidence that will harm them. I doubt very much they will do that.Edited: 2 years ago "

"Dear Itrustme, I think you need to change that user name. It's not working out for you. The theft is indeed suspicious. But you saw those things, and clearly you thought it notable that the van occupants you suspect of doing the deed saw you and went to the empty villa next door. There was also ample other indications that people were very interested in when you would be there. At the very least, once you told them when you would be out, you still left everything unprotected. You're lucky the insurer paid anything. There's a clearly worded ""reasonable care"" clause in the policy requiring you to behave with your valuables as if you were not insured. And you can't legitimately complain of technicalities and loopholes. I've read the policy language. It's actually reasonably clearly written. I've seen much more obtuse policy language. And the definition of ""excess"" and the amounts for each class of property is clearly stated, as is the cash insurance policy. You complain, ""Staysure wont pay for stolen cash as it wasnt in a safe or on our person."" That's right. That's exactly what the policy clearly states. Section 6c Personal Money & PassportWhat is covered:We will pay you up to £300 for Basic cover and£500 for Comprehensive cover, if during a trip, thePersonal Money you are carrying on your personor you have left in a safety deposit box is lost, stolen,damaged or destroyed,...And all the details of what's covered and for how much is clearly presented. Nothing is left to the imagination, but you managed to construct some imaginary coverage. How you did that, I can't imagine. I can't muster much sympathy. You left cash in an unattended room. Apparently didn't even hide it. And you walked out, leaving your money behind, after you had seen suspicious activity. And you didn't care enough about your goods and cash to even read the insurance policy. You either just assumed it was some sort of fantasy insurance, or you read the policy and thought they didn't mean it and would make it all better because they're such generous people. If you STILL haven't read your policy, let me enlighten you:https:/…policywording-20170531.pdfYour post actually amounts to a positive review for Surestay, because they seem to have paid off, within the limits of their clearly worded policy. And that's what we like insurance companies to do."
"I'm sorry, but I have to agree. I don't think you took care of your money or yoru valuables. You apepar to have known that there were things wrong, like no cctv, yet you didn't take this into consideration at all from what I can see. Nor did you seem to be overly concerned about telling people when you would be out, and the van arriving shortly after the time you were supposed to be leaving would be very suspicious ot me.We don't take a lot of valuables of cash with us when we go on a trip, but any money or valuables we do have go into a safe or are kept with us. Even safes can be broken into, but if that happens, we know we'll be covered."

">>>So how many people would stay in on holiday cos a van pulled up outside the next villa?<<<It's not that in isolation, though, is it? You were asked several times about your plans and movements. There was no funcitioning security devices. It's a cul de sac and when the van driver sawy you, he went to the next villa instead.Maybe I'm paranoid but all of that would add up to something funny going on for me.Anyway, your desire to warn others is good, and your informaiton on contacting AirBnB will undoubtedly be helpful to others.I just think it's even more helpful, if at all possible, to warn people to take good care of their possessions, and to be aware of limitations on any travel insurance you might have. I don't think you have any grounds at all to comnplain about your insurance not paying out, sorry."
"They certainly aren't going to pay you more than the policy limits just because you did not read the ""fine print"" as you call it. That fine print is the limits they will pay.Kudos to Texan for actually taking the time to read your policy for you and explain it to you. No insurance is unlimited. No insurance is going to pay you above the limits or for things not covered in the policy.I am sorry this happened to you."
"You're still on about the insured not ""explaining"" what was covered. But they did, and it's not ""fine print"" or hard to understand. You just couldn't open the document, so you ignored the issue. I bought medical trip insurance. I made sure I read the policy. I could have fantasized about what it covered, but that could have gotten me left holding an empty bag. Yes, lot's of people don't read their insurance policies or at least ask questions. But I got it easily from the web site, and it was perfectly clear what was covered and not covered. You apparently didn't even ask for the document to be resent. If they'd tried to ""explain"" it to you, you'd complain later that they forgot to tell you something. That's why it's in print. Face it. You messed up, and now you want to blame someone else for your foolishness. And while ""lots"" of people may not read their insurance policies, they still don't leave large sums of cash in their rented rooms. You didn't leave yours ""at home."" You left in a rented accommodation without knowing anything about the environment or who had access. You'll ask ""hundreds of questions""? Have you even now read the policy? It answers far more than hundreds of questions, including all those you won't know to ask. It's a common problem, people demanding that someone else be responsible for and pay them when they make mistakes. And pleading ""disability"" for behaving foolishly is an insult to people with disabilities."
Who leaves large sums of cash even in their house? And if you do and you have a break in good luck claiming it on your homeowners policy.
Can we get back on Gilkris' original topic of “Airbnb posted reviews?”
"Sure. Like all such online operations that mostly run on automatic, they've struggled to find ways to make reviews more accurate. I don't think they deliberately, as a company, try to manipulate reviews to bias them toward the positive. In the past, they've made changes in how they allow reviews to post, presumably toward that end of making them more accurate. In the beginning, like many new sites, they may have specifically tried for positive reviews to help start up. But today, if they're thinking straight, they want valid negatives to make to the site, because that helps prevent angry post in places like this and tends to discipline the hosts, over whom they have virtually no control. But hosts cannot edit a guest's review. Nor can they get it deleted unless it violates policy. But clearly from many posts, there are well reviewed hosts who still maintain dumps. On many such sites, one thing that's hard to defeat is trade in mutual positive reviews. Also posting of no worse than neutral reviews for fear of review retaliation. Airbnb's move to not publish reviews until both host and guest have submitted them doesn't cure that problem. Reviews can be edited. And hosts have been known to make it clear they insist on a positive review, sometimes a condition of getting a refund for a terrible place. But there's another weakness that also appears with many hotel web sites. You can't post a review unless you actually stay there. So if the hotel or bnb host loses your reservation, or the place is such an obvious crack house that you refuse to stay there, you can't review it. There's simply no ability to actually investigate venues or the accuracy of reviews. Same problem as third party travel sites. They depend on the suppliers to be accurate, and they don't inquire into complaints. And when a site makes it money by virtue of people letting out their places to guests, they aren't eager to reduce their number, and the benefit of a doubt goes to the host. In those situations, you often find a culture in which regular users learn to read through the positive reviews that contain veiled negatives. Coded language develops to accomplish it. Plus, these aren't hotels. They aren't established businesses with professional management and hard-won reputations. The hosts are not even committed to the long term. So they are far more likely than a hotel to have conflicts with their personal time and schedules or just plain bad days, and the otherwise well-reviewed place is a mess for that guest. It's the risk you take dealing with amateurs. And no doubt the hosts have the same review complaints. Many people are just swine and will wreck any room they occupy. And I'm sure hosts can tell of guests with good reviews who destroyed the place. And even in the best circumstances, Airbnb apparently suffers from the same disability of all online cheap whatever sites.When things go wrong, or something should be done that can only be done by a human above the level of simple phone bank customer service, they have no real mechanism to rescue the situation. The expense of that is not part of their structure. Or I could have it all wrong."
"Never trust Airbnb. I would love to share photos, but let's just say it was not close. I would like to share an experience today that goes completely against what Airbnb is marketing in this post. We had booked a property 2 months ago and upon arrival identified a gas leak, a smell of something dead, and a lack of cleanliness beyond what we paid for (our linens were laid out in the rain and we were suppose to clean them and put them away?) Yet Airbnb's response is they won't cancel and refund out reservation as we needed to give our Host time to repair the situation. 8 hours of worrying about where we were going to stay in a strange country wasn't enough??? I'm amazed and so will you be, once you see the pictures depicting a clear lack of honesty, but this is what Airbnb is supporting. Do NOT book with them. Response from Airbnb:Thanks for your response. I'm sorry to hear that you won't be continuing the reservation with you host. With the cleanliness issues presented in this case we're unable to compel a refund from your host, because they are issues that he should be able to remedy given time.Your host has also had a professional out to check the listing for the gas leak and confirm that there is no gas leak, so unfortunately I cannot force a refund in this instance either.If your concerns are regarding the state of the linens within the listing I'm happy to work with you and your host to come to a solution to fix this. Otherwise I can assist you with a cancellation and your host may be open to refunding you outside of his cancellation policy."
"First and last time on AIRBNB, the host (Tabitha ans Adam renting in Orlando) did not respond. I e -mailed them to find out why they did not respond. They replied that I did not write how many people were staying and that I did not say why we were staying in Orlando and then said that they do not respond to solicitations. The entire e mail was very strange. I filled out what dates needed, how many guests and why we were going to Orlando. I will never know why this host did not see that I filled out dates, guests and why we needed the condo. I will never understand why they said we were soliciting them. I can only guess that the AIRBNB wed site is a very poorly written web site. Poorly managed and full of a holes like Tabitha and Adam that are there to waste peoples time. Fortunately the next site I tried got us a better bigger cheaper condo in Orlando."
"I just booked 2 places in Switzerland. Now I'm really wondering why every place I looked at, and there were many, were all 5 star reviews. I thought that maybe Airbnb has high standards and only deals with clean places and good hosts. Now I'm wondering if I'm naive!"
"I've been trying to book a vacation home in Saugatuck, MI that uses Airbnb. Has anyone else ever had issues with Airbnb? This site is the most awkward, unattended site I've ever been on. I've tried several times to book the rental and have had nothing but trouble with their site. I finally gave up on booking the rental, so the owner just lost $2300 because of the incompetence of airbnb."
"I was a great fan of this service for about two-three years until I faced an ugly situation.I had a bad experience with the apartment in Tel Aviv in the high season in August. It was so bad that when I provided photos to Airbnb, they returned me back 50% of total cost.But later I understoond why there are so many good reviews (good scores) for awful apartments. It is just the policy of Airbnb. They do not want to spoil their reputation and image allowing to use the site bad hosts. That's why they do their best to hide negative reviews.After my experience I have left a true review for the apartment and they hid it. The explanation was that the host provided them with some evidence that I was bribing money from him for a good review. I have provided our sms-exchange and wattsapp messages. But they took his side. It was especially strange and disgusting taking into consideration that the guy cheated with apartment description and there were awful conditions and his ad was a fraud. And they themselves obliged him to pay me back 50%.I will never recommend to use it as you there you are buying pig in a poke."
"We rented an Airbnb and we left after the 1st night. We lost $1300.00. The home was not structurally sound . The electrical outlets did not work The deck attached to our room was detaching from the home and had yellow CAUTION tape across. It was grossly leaning to the left ( no where near being a level floor). They ran a daycare center out of the home which was NOT in the listing. It was dirty. It had a hodge podge of furniture, meaning it is clear it was all gathered from thrift stores and/or flea markets. No use of the kitchen even though the listing said otherwise..... And on top of that, the owner literally KICKED the tiny dog several time until he yelped into submission when he barked. On top of all of this when we contacted Airbnb they would not allow us to leave an honest review. They said our review would not be made public unless the owner approved it....DUHHHHHStay ANYWHERE BUT HERE:  https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19229069…Edited: 2 years ago "
"Follow up from Gilkris....the original post. Since we had a very small budget, we decided to try Airbnb again for an extended trip to Amsterdam. The first host we contacted in Amsterdam rejected us because we left our first (and only) Airbnb location early and posted a negative review. Ok...we tried another location. That host responded warmly and our experience was ok, not perfect, but for the price, ok. We responded with an honest review.I still don't quite understand how the Airbnb review process truly works. I got how its supposed to work, but I don't think that's the real story. Anyway, this TripAdvisor conversation offers good information and I thank all the contributors."
"If any process can be abused, eventually it will be abused. AirBnB has fallen victim to their own success. Once they became well known, people realized that there are pretty much no controls on how rentals are described, so owners can offer all sorts of hovels described as pleasant places. And once they then realized that the combination of AirBnB wanting badly to keep renters and incidence of people trying to claim refunds or extort hosts with exaggerated negative claims made AirBnB deliberately hesitant to publish bad reviews. One can feel for AirBnB management, but it will very difficult for them to establish any effective local inquiries into rentals. Their nightmare is similar to Uber's, someone getting killed while using a substandard offering. They're not alone. All of the third party booking sites that allow hosts to generate their own descriptions and photos are suffering more reports of false listings. They're seeing odd rooms and apartment clusters described as ""hotels."" Anyone using any of these sites just needs to use the Internet to do research, looking at neighborhood profiles and viewing with Streetview and doing review searches at other than the site in question. For that matter, setting up a travel site is relatively straightforward, especially for people who are experienced in e-commerce. It too easy to turn on the automatic software, scavenge reviews, photos and descriptions off other sites, hire a call center to deflect complaints and just let the users whose trips go to pieces deal with it themselves. The market pressures that lead people to assume that any business would have failed if they were no good at it, the way it works locally, just don't exist on the Internet. There's always plenty of new customers, and if it gets too bad, you just change the domain name and keep going. It's still the wild west, and there's no sheriff."
"I veyr much agree with you. When it began, AirBnB was a good idea and served a useful purpose wiht people renting out their spare rooms occasionally to travellers. Unfortunately, as you rightly say, it became too successful and attracted those who knew that he model could be abused and taken advantage of, both hosts and renters. Even worse, in my view, is that it's now become a big business, so we have commericla outfits involved who have realised that they cna make a lot more money from tourists than they can from renting out apartments in cities like London.It's a shame that things developed this way, but it's probably also inevitable."
"Yep, and as the business gets bigger, the decisions more and more are made by higher and higher level executives who tend to decide on the basis of revenue, not service. Not that there's anything AirBnB could have done. There's clearly not enough revenue in just taking a cut of rentals to vet all the offerings or investigate complaints. But even mrandmrssmith.com, where they claim to individually send in undercover guests to vet places, get's complaints of misrepresentation."
"Absolutely right. I'm not blaming AirBnB as such for what's happened, any more than I hold Uber responsible for anything that an individual driver or passenger does. The business model is what it is for each.I'm not a massive fan of either, but I can recognise that both started out as a good idea, at least in theory. And Uber can still work well in some places."
"Debbie B, you should claim the difference on your travel insurance. I have had nothing by success and good experiences from my airBnBs. I keep checking the reviews and being in touch with the host. I reconfirm ahead of time - just like I do with a hotel. If there aren't reviews, or if they say they are sold through other sites, ask for the details so you can read the reviews. There are certainly bad reviews on AirBnB, but there are also certainly scams as well.As stated, they are too big and can't vet every listing - and one should realize this before entering into the contract. It is unfortunate you were not able to get in touch with them within the 24 hour grace period, but that is also a responsibility of yours to try and reach them. Being 'busy or further committed' means you made a decision of your priorities. Boxer was definitely in the wrong for not having the place ready in time, but as further consideration - what if the renters before you trashed the place? Maybe Boxer was trying to replace damaged goods - on Christmas Eve - just for you.It is also your responsibility to keep track of all the details sent to you by the hosts so it is handy - not scrolling through emails on site and then complaining about it.In this day and age, every person has to expect to take some responsibility for the success of their travel. I get the feeling you weren't well prepared and expected high end hotel service for a 'pent house' when it is just some guy's place. Sure, he might run real estate rentals...or not....did you even ask him why the rooms didn't match the photos or give him any time to fix the problem?Any reading of the terms and conditions for AirBnB clearly outline your rights...and responsibilities. They will act as intermediary, but the host has 24 hours to try and fix the problem. If you didn't understand that, or didn't want to comply to the conditions and cancelled, then you have to accept the forfeiture agreements.No, I am not an AirBnB host, and no, I have no personal interests in AirBnB other than having success and taking responsibility for being an informed client."
"We did contact them quiltingmama & they did not answer. Not sure what else we could have done to reach them.There is no excuse for boxer to not have checked the condo after the other people checked out. I expected the place to be clean, have furniture & for the second bathroom to be available as advertised! Call me crazy, but seriously how can someone call themselves a host & not check the property prior to the next people checking in?Boxer was not clear with his instructions for getting into the condo. There just happened to be numbers in an email that my wife found. Are we supposed to have esp & guess that is the code?Is it so difficult for you to admit boxer was a terrible host & failed miserably with us? You do sound like an air bnb employee or apologist.Wow, blaming us for a host who dropped the ball on many accounts! We were in contact with him prior to going there & he never told us about the code to get in, that we would not be able to use the second bathroom, that parking was not free, that we would have to check in late, that the place would be a message, he had us in a different location than his advertised address & there would be minimal furniture in there. Now, how would we know? Unbelievable!"
"He/she didn't excuse the host. He/she merely pointed out what might have been going on and reaffirmed that no matter what, he was a poor host. And you were reminded of accurate information about AirBnB and your incorrect assumption of what to expect, which is, if you hang around here a while, a common situation and theme of many complaint about many booking site operations. And since you haven't been here long, you perhaps don't know that accusing someone who taken the time to make more than ten thousand posts answering questions and helping travelers of being a stooge for a travel site is plain boorish. Of course, if you had come here before and searched comments on AirBnB, you would have known the risks and some of the things you can do to avoid them. That's the answer to, ""How were we to know?"" And if you continue to travel and book blindly, you will have other bad experiences, no matter who you book with.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Debbie, the poitn is that the AirBnB system is always going to allow for terrible hosts. In my opinion there's a much higher risk of a poor experience with AirBnB than other rental companies, simply because of how it started and the way it works.Diligence is always required, but in my view, especially so when dealing with AirBnB."
"I would seriously recommend no one doing business with Airbnb!Make sure you read ALL of their policies, especially when it comes to cancellations! I just had a group that was supposed to stay at our cabin during one of our busiest Holiday weekends of the year and they cancelled a few hours before they were supposed to arrive. They blamed this on the cancelled flight of a couple of their guests. The rest could still make it! They classify this as an ""extenuating circumstance"" and you are therefore left high and dry with absolutely NO disbursement of your deposit or any way to recoup any of the rental amount at all! So they basically can make up ANY type of lame excuse to get out of a booking up until the last minute, which is pretty sad. No other Hotel, Bed and Breakfast or any other online vacation rental site we use has this policy! The renter would have to typically forgo at least half of the rental amount if it's cancelled less than 30 days prior to arrival. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
That sounds like it works out pretty well for the renter!
"409Ginger; I don't understand your situation.On the one hand, you sound like an Airbnb host, then say don't use them. I note that with many, many Airbnb's a cancelled booking could mean a substantial forfeiture of a guest's prepayment. 50% plus admin fees seems to be fairly standard. Does none of the deposit go to you?On the flip side, it seems like a host can cancel any time, with no penalty.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Yes, we are hosts. And they refunded the ENTIRE rental amount, deposit and all, back to the guests, nothing at all back to us. A totally lost weekend, when I had other people asking to reserve our place."
"I'm not trying to challenge you but rather trying to understand the system. Can't you, as host, specify certain terms related to cancellation? For example less than 24-48 hours = 1 night penalty; less than 7 days = 50% etc.I see terms like that frequently."
"You can classify your cancellation policy as either strict, moderate, etc. But they always have that caveat in ALL the policies about ""extenuating circumstances"" so they basically have the final say is what it boils down to. If you have a good enough excuse and I guess can plead your case well enough, they will side against the host, since I'm sure they want people to continue to use their site to look for housing."

"I just want to say that I find the process of leaving feedback unfair, especially if there is a problem which needs time to be resolved,, as you are encouraged to leave positive feedback to keep owners sweet,, who then drop you like a stone when they get your review and refuse to help or compensate you saying they didn't have adequate insurance. to cover you in their property.. Many owners are NOT buying adequate insurance in case of accidents or break ins in their properties,, out of the hundreds a week we are paying for the rentals.surely they could insure the places they rent out.. THAT should be a must for all who rent out property as we were left tricked into thinking the owner had adequate insurance but he did not... I would advise people to take a cctv camera away with them to watch who enters the property when your not there. We will be doing this year.."
"You're making two incorrect assumptions. One is that AirBnB can expend the resources to vet their hosts for things like insurance and remain in business without taking such a big bite of rentals that hosts raise prices significantly. Their business, like all bargain travel sites, must run almost entirely on automatic for the business model to work. Complaining about this is about like complaining that McDonald's doesn't have waiters and real china. And like all Internet travel businesses, they were created from a concept with a single goal of making money. It was never conceived of as a service to renters. It is simply a process idea in which a given property creates a given revenue from each rental, and it cost them almost nothing to list the property. And because relatively few users will do any research on the site or the property and will focus almost entirely on price, there is no practical limit on the number of customers. Sure, they could do some expensive things to get more customers, but that wouldn't make the profit envisioned in the business plan. And if you read the web site, including their Terms and Conditions, and pay attention to who they are addressing in their policies, you will see that they exist to serve the hosts. So it's no surprise that most every decision is aimed at keeping hosts happy. There's always another customer. It's the limited number of hosts you need to keep. This, of course, appeals to hosts who are there for only one reason. (And it's not because they like strangers staying with them and in their property.)"
"That's an excellent post by 5thGen whihc explains the AirBnB business model very clearly. It was a simple idea in the first place, and based on a very casual system where non professional renters let out their spare rooms and surplus space to those who were happy to use it. Things have changed a lot since those early days."
I am considering becoming a host. Can you tell me any pros and cons as you see them?
Can anyone tell me how to send an email to Airbnb Head Office? I made a booking - there was no place for me to cancel. So I replied to an Airbnb email and asked them to cancel the booking. When I look in my trips folder the booking does not show but the owner keeps writing to me and says he looks forward to seeing me etc. I can't reply to his email it keeps bouncing back. I have tried the 'hints'etc but need to speak to someone at Head Office. Can anyone help?Thank you
"Ishwa, you can find contact details of Airbnb corporate using this link: www.elliott.org/company-contacts/airbnb/ If you will be able to resolve your problem by contacting them is an interesting question."
"oF THE MANY SITES DEVOTED TO 'REVIEWS' ABOUT AIRBNB, IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST 80% OF ALL POSTS ARE NEGATIVE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE. My own experience is a nightmare the likes of which I have never heard before. I rented to a miserable woman from Sweden for 1 month - she gave me her arrival time, then showed up 3 hours early (I was at the doctor and while I was back well before her due time, I did keep her waiting for 20=30 mins.). She KNEW my location and that I have dogs, but she began to complain about them. Then she complained because she could smell a 'man' and she detested the smell of men - so I did extra washing of pillows etc and used scented candles to hide a manly smell. She was booked for 1 month. In 4-5 days I left the house for a doc appt and while gone she took it upon herself to throw out a huge amount of food from my fridge (making such a huge mess I could not sort through a large trashcan to salvage things, so I let it go. But then, 2 days later I went to another appt and once again she went to kitchen and emptied the fridge of everything but a few condiments - unopened pkgs of cheese and butter, fruit and veggies, meat, everything. She claimed it was because everything was spoiled (that is an outright lie). She also threw out medication for the dogs from a counter, cookies, crackers, nuts, even microwave popcorn! Clearly, the insane woman has huge emotional issues, aside from being a meddling vile b****. After the second time, I confronted her and she got huffy and announced she was leaving in the morning and wanted a full refund. I said NO WAY, that she owed me at least $400 for groceries. So the following morning she left, she contacted airbnb who in turn let her cancel her month-long booking, giving her a full refund and leaving me stranded! I then demanded reimbursement for the food I lost - which was merely a paperwork deal - they gave me a credit against the debt for rent, so as far as I am concerned, I got screwed twice and the wretch of a woman got off scott free with NO inconvenience. airbnb has made ARBITRARY rulings and changes that enable cancellation without cause, putting the host at risk which if for a long booking is a huge deal. Now this miserable insane woman was allowed to post a negative review referring to my home as a house of horrors - even though for 3 years I have had nothing but excellent reviews. But this one will stand out, loaded with lies - re a beautiful home, a private suite that is well furnished, CLEAN, well appointed etc. I am livid and furious and have no intention of ever doing business with this scam operation again.I should note that there are hundreds of complaints online about airbnb, if not thousands and a huge number are from hosts who resent the rule that enables cancellations without cause or notice. As for customer service - THERE IS NONE, ZIP, NADA - just platitudes, empty words and promises and placation! TO HELL WITH AIRBNB!"
the guest writes reviews and host can't alter or change them.
Kesweet...Wow!Do you cuss and SHOUT at your guests and call them a “meddling vile b**** “ to their faces ?Perhaps you aren’t cut out for the “ hospitality “ business......Good luck....Edited: 2 years ago 
"Airbnb will take the host's side no matter what the problem. The one time I needed them to be an honest referee Airbnb failed me in spite of providing evidence that the host failed to provide the services promised. You should check trustpilot, google reviews, and consumer affairs and read the horrid reviews of Airbnb."
"They apparently don't allow the negative reviews to be published. What a scam. I have tried writing a negative review, and am being ignored."
"I just had a terrible experience using Airbnb. I reserved from January two weeks to stay in Miami and later I changed it for only one week. They answer that everything was Ok. And yesterday, 6 days before my travel, they sent me a mail telling me that my reservation was cancelled and my payment would be send me back. Even though I was to stay only one week and the payment for this week was already debited they cancelled my reservation. I think, at least Airbnb could have written a mail to me before cancel it. I not only lost the reservation. I also lost, or rather, they unfairly take away from me $ 64 since they will repay me $ 428.63 and originally they debited me for $ 492.79. I feel cheated!!My recommendation is That if you are going to use Airbnb, you have to be very careful reviewing your reservation and confirming that everything is ok."
"Another very big issue that has come up globally is government intervention in Airbnb. All over Europe, Vancouver Canada and Ireland are being hit with licencing, fines and closures. This is particularly so where housing costs have escalated and permanent rentals are difficult to find.Anyone thinking of usinf Airbnb, should research the town/city for news and ask on the appropriate TA forum.Edited: 2 years ago "
I do not use Airbnb's.
Airbnb hosts have cancelled last 3 out 3 bookings.Not using airbnb again.
"My host decided to cancel my reservations 9 days prior to my stay in order to extend another customer's stay. What is airbnb doing to protect its users like me who are booking through them? Nothing. They offered me $15.00 extra on top of a full refund to help re-book another airbnb place (basically bribing me to continue to use their service) or just refund all my money back into my credit card. They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge the host a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits airbnb and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me, rather they let the host explain why they cancelled on the renter, which doesn't make sense because the host will obviously lie which is pretty much a one sided story being told.My host asked me to cancel twice so she can keep her super host status and not be charge with the cancellation fee. On top of it all, if i had agree, I wouldn't have got my refund. I feel like not being able to leave a honest review of the host and why the host cancelled on me leaves a questionable area in the whole business. Reviews are meant to be helpful in both ways, so Consumers can make a choice base on their opinions. But I guess after all, it is a business, so they only want the good reviews to be posted."
Airbnb is rubbish and we'll never use it again. Just got charged $70-97 for the privilege of cancelling a booking that we could not make because of the French train strike. Owner didn't get back to us after messaging to alter dates. We booked on iPhone but they only let you cancel by desktop computer. What a scam!
"My experience with AirBnB was not positive. We rented a place in DC. The picture shows a place on street level. We went there, and tried the door and a dog started barking inside the place. Finally I noticed there was a downstairs apartment. The owner never mentioned apt. B. It was dark down there, so I turned on my phone and still could not see a place to insert a code. We thought we had the wrong address, and called another Uber, who took us in a circle, and then to a hotel. We asked AirBnB to call us. The message is they will in 10 minutes. After an hour I called them. AirBnB short holds are at least 20 minutes. Wish us luck on a refund."
"The host can remove the listing, and relist it under a different name-getting rid of all the bad reviews. This happened to me during my first and only time at an airbnb. The host can only do this if there are no scheduled bookings for the house i.e. they will lose all their future listings."
"I recently had a very negative experience using AirBnB. It was my first time using them. Usually, we use VBRO. Since we were unable to get in the apartment, and it took the host an hour to call us back, and it was late we went to a hotel. The host did not only any level try to compromise, he just took our money. It has been over a day and my review has not posted to the site. I don't think it ever will. It also appears that some of the postings are not for the property you are looking at. They may be for other properties the owner has. So the answer is it does not look like airBnB posts negative reviews, and the positive ones may be planted,"
"I spent 6 nights at an Airbnb in Dublin near Pearse Station and it was probably as good as it gets at all levels.See, I'm not all negative."
"My recommendation is to NOT believe the reviews. What I will tell others who want to use AirBnB is that I highly recommend they do two things: 1) Read the AirBnB customer policy (you will find as a renter you have no rights, and little recourse). And 2) Call AirBnB customer support on a weekend night and see how long it takes for you to get through should you have an issue with your host. We had trouble getting into our accommodation, and our host didn't answer his phone. He took our money anyway. The address was 147 11 Street NE, Washington D.C. I recommend your avoid it,Edited: 2 years ago "
"""...as a renter you have no rights, and little recourse....."" How true! I just found that out the hard way:I planned a two-month stay in Europe. Booked long stays on AirBnB more than four months in advance. Communicated with all the owners, who accepted our bookings. Had to fork out big $$$$$ well in advance, to make advance payments. Total of three bookings in two different cities. AFTER the trip had started, TWO of them cancelled -- one cited a plumbing problem and the other said nothing whatsoever -- I just got a peremptory message from AirBnB saying the booking was canceled and I could have a small compensatory payment. After the cancellation by the owner, the apartment was shown as once again available!!!! Oh, and by the way, this owner was classed as a ""Superhost."" Hahaha.....No way was the payment offered enough to compensate me for the ruination of my relaxed vacation, having to spend full days trying to find alternate accommodation. (Surprise surprise, available prices are much higher two weeks in advance than four months in advance, when I had made the original bookings.) As far as I'm concerned, AirBnB is the pits, and from now on I am going to stick with traditional hotel/lodging booking sites.....the deck is stacked against customers on AirBnB. You have no protection against lousy landlords and I will not tolerate that kind of experience again. Hotels (which have a reputation to protect, and cannot hide behind the Silicon Valley mantra of ""oh we just make the software"") are going to get my business in the future."
The host can delete the entire site and relist it under a different name to avoid a bad review.I will never stay in one sgain.
This company lacks integrity and steals from it's customers.. If you cancel a reservation you lose fifty percent of the total cost. That is 50% . This company uses its ridiculous polices to steal from people. Why is this dirt bag business still operating.
"Scam Artists......will take half of total price paid for reservation , if you cancel.This is a legitimate company set up to scam and cheat it's customers. READ THE FINE PRINT... This is how they cheat people."
"They steal from you by enforcing the terms of their cancellation policy, which is in writing and which you agree to when you make a reservation?"
"If they are sticking to the T&C's you agreed to as part of the contract you were entering into, then how can they be cheating you?It's up to you to read and understand those terms before you proceed. If you don't bother, then you have to take the consequences."
"BewareAir bandb cancelled a six month advance reservation in London one week before we were set to goThere was no assistance and I was left high and dry with huge London hotel billsI have heard this often happens. The air B and B response did not even include an apology.People are in this to make money and Not to serve travellers,Edited: 2 years ago "
"Air BnB may always have been all about making money. It certainly is now. It has become big business for some, and far removed form the original idea of allowing people to rent out a spare room occasionally."
">>Air bandb cancelled a six month advance reservation in London one week before we were set to go<<Highly unlikely Air B&B canceled your booking unless there was some problem with your payment. It's more likely that the rental property owner themselves cancelled. Maybe the owner had a family emergency, broken sewer lines, found bedbugs or a myriad of other reasons other than just to ruin your holiday. You may never find out the reason but these things do happen on Air B&B.>>People are in this to make money and Not to serve travelers<<REally????. How terrible of them! (Sarcasm intended) I know my company does it for the money more than serving the public.How do I know this? Let's just say in know the owner reeeaaalllly well.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I think you're right. I doubt it was AirBnB that cancelled anything. I can't see what benefit it is to them to do such a thing. I can see how it could benefit the owner, though. And, to be fair, I can also think of many gneuine reasons why that property might no longer be available. Maybe one of the most likely reasons is that they were not allowed to rent out their property in the first place. I'm afraid that this is all too common in London."
"Issues around regulations, bylaws and licensing are becomming major problems everywhere. Dublin, and soon probably all of Ireland is cracking down big time because of suspected tax evasion; owners not claiming rental income. In Vancouver BC there are two problems; strata buildings where units have been rented, contrary to bylaws, occupied by travellers, strata finds out and disables the building electronic access to that unit.The City of Vancouver just introduced a licensing process that only permits short term rentals where the owner lives in the unit. No entire suites. 400 units immediately disappeared and 1500 are being investigated. That right there could account for up to 2,000 ""cancellations.""Because hosts cannot communicate directly with renters and because corporate Airbnb controls communications, a renter may never know why a booking was cancelled.A major overhaul of the entire Airbnb business model is needed."
"We recently spent 6 weeks driving in Northern Spain and used many AirBnB’s and had wonderful experiences from ALL of them. Our favorite one was in Zaragoza, Spain where our host, Ana Castel, was the sweetest young lady who had a perfect, little apartment for us in the center of town, one block from Plaza de Espana. Her place was spotless, so therefore, we left it spotless in return. She went over and beyond in helping us park our car in the center of town (underground), using her parking space for 3 days/nights free. She included her parents with us and was our personal guide (free) on our first full day in Zaragoza. I had read all the reviews on her place (#113497245) and every single one was “Outstanding”. We would highly recommend her place and loved every minute we spent with her."

"I had the same problem. Below is what happened to us. I posted my review on sitejabberWe rented a home for the Kentucky Derby. Spent over 3500 for three nights. The place was a dump. There was a cat in the house which we were highly allergic to. No ice and the fridge was broken. Hidden security camera was located. Loaded guns in the closet floor. One less bedroom that was on the description, a couch so dirty that is was black tar.With all of these problems, they did nothing to refund our money.We had to file in smalls claims court. Airbnb actually made the owners changed the description of the cat and the bedroom after we complained about, but we received no help. Airbnb is only concerned about renting these dumps out and making a profit rather than taking care of the customer."
">>>Airbnb is only concerned about renting these dumps out and making a profit rather than taking care of the customer.<<<I'm just wondering who AirBnB regard as their customer, the guest or the owner?"
"I wish I had read this forum before I reserved an Airbnb in Maple Grove, MN. We were excited about our first bnb stay as it was no more expensive than the motel room I was about to reserve for 3 weeks near family in this NW section of Minneapolis. Like other posters, we were about a week away but on the road when the e-mail from Airbnb came saying our reservation had been canceled, no explanation and no response to my e-mails. This will never happen again because I won't make the same mistake."
"Hi The same thing has also just happened to us in Toulouse. I wrote a very bad review and it has not shown up. The only reviews you ever see on Air bnb are the ones that they allow you to see which are only the good ones. I have never seen a bad review. I know that there have been some because some of the hosts have replied and it does say something about what the person is complaining about but that particular review is never there. I have just literally returned from Toulouse in an apartment that part of it was completely dirty and we couldn't stay there, it was Chaleureux T2 centre ville au calme + patio in Toulouse. The patio was absolutely disgusting, covered in mould and bowebs and hadn't been cleaned in months. The kitchen table had dirty sticky marks on it and there was some kitchen furniture fallen off in the kitchen which again was dirty, Not to mention that you only got 1 towel!! I waited for 2 hours then cancelled the reservation and left the property. It was a total cost of £225.00 for 3 nights. When we complained to Air BnB they were not too bothered and told me to go the the resolution centre and request a refund from the Host, well I knew that wasn't going to happen. What was even worse was they were only allowing me to ask for £173.00 back. WHY? I paid £225.00 for place that i could not stay in. Of course the host refused to refund me. So now I will not get my money back as air BnB are not bothered. The reply from the host was that all his reviews say that the place is perfect. Well of course they would wouldn't they because they do not put the bad reviews on the site. Also watch out for some of the photos are taken very crafty, they are making the places look bigger than they are and of course they are only taken when the place is spotless. BEWARE everybody, and STAY CLEAR of them, you could lose your money as I have and it looks like many other people too. I will never use Air Bnb again"
"Hi It is most definitely the owner and not the guest - they do not give a crap about the people who rent them. They do not help when there is a problem and we the people who rent them are out of pocket, BIG TIMEBEWARE EVERYBODY, STAY CLEAR OF THEM!!!Oh and just to let you know the place I stayed at was Chaleureux T2 centre ville au calme + patio in Toulouse!Edited: 2 years ago "
Howard M in fact we rented a place and was robbed on the last night. We know it was an inside job keys had been used to unlock the grill and door the locks were in the unlocked position the lock barrel missing it had been taken to replace it ready to con someone else as the police do not come out in fact they didn't seem surprised at all when we gave the address. It had been made to look as if it was a break in but by the reaction of the key holder and the fact they said they would check the place the next day and said they wont be back tonight. WELL they had taken all our money and valuables so why would they return.
Do NOT trust AirBnB reviews. They only post the ones that they like--especially if you are negative about your AirBnB experience.
"Guests pay AirBnB and they take a cut. Therefore guests contract is with AirBnB whatever their T&Cs say. Unlike eBay, for example, where you pay the seller directly AirBnB hold the money until the stay is complete (making more on interest). Ultimately they have to bear the responsibility and should cover additional costs when things go wrong and ensure better policies and penalties are in place to prevent things going wrong. I suspect it will all come to a big legal blow out at some point in the future."
"Stayed 13-16th July Apartemento Malagueta, Calle Pintor Martinez Virel.Fantastic location adjacent to a fabulous beach. Unfortunately we were robbed of approximately £1200 taken form a locked suitcase with no sign of breaking in , no forced entry very suspicious. Reported to police, Airbnb have no cover nor does the owner for other than damage . Company andHost reaction very poor, last time Airbnb, they needed to step up and didn't."
"Hi Simon F your information is not correct. I am an Airbnb host. We do not pay Airbnb anything up front other than they take a cut from each booking. They do not hold funds until the end of the stay and are usually released 24 hours after a guest has checked in. No matter if they check in for one night or 10 nights. So its not about interest at all. My guests are my responsibility , they use the Airbnb platform to find me and other hosts. Things can go wrong like any booking no matter if hotel or bed and breakfast. But over all Airbnb do a really good job of looking after both customer and host. I have used AirBnb all over the world numerous times and only one time had an issue where a booking was not what it was made out to be. I was given a refund and booked another place. And you may be surprised how many locations use both Airbnb and other companys to advertise there apartments / hotel rooms! I love being a host , have met some wonderful people , got great reviews and love being hosted. Just got back the other week from Alicante lovely sea front apartment for half the price of what I would have paid in a hotel. I know airbnb has its haters similar to Uber ;-) but its a great option for people who travel the world or travel often. We should be glad of the choice! my 10 cents ;-)Edited: 2 years ago "
"Airbnb Cancelling Nightmare- tried to book a place in Halifax with Monica. I never received booking confirmation so I moved on and booked a hotel. Four days after booking attempt I see a charge for $1476 on my account. Airbnb says I have two accounts and confirmation was emailed . The email they sent confirmation to had invalid address ending in.ccom. They probablyhave received undeliverable notice. Cancellation policy is 48 hours. Airbnb and host just kept pointing finger at each other to cancel handle cancellation. Finally got booking cancelled but 48 hour cancellation policy provides 50% refund. However, the host can refund 100%. I cancelled over 30 days before the booking to free up her property but she chose to keep my $735 anyway which is just wrong on soooo many levels. Done with Airbnb. This was my second booking with Airbnb and I will NEVER EVER book with them again. Did I mention they kept my $735. No apology just smiling all the way to the bank."
"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment ... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. The host replied that: (a) no provision of fans was listed in the apartment listing, and (b) that there was no one to pay for the fans since she was not the owner of the apartment. We didn't even find any help from Airbnb. We contacted Airbnb on the very first day of our stay and received an email about three days later saying that someone would contact us soon. But no one did till Thursday, two days before our departure! A representative of Airbnb called us to apologise for what had happened and offer to pay for the fan if we decide to buy one. We had already looked for a shop from where to buy a fan but couldn't find. We didn't need Airbnb's money or go ahead to buy a fan. But Airbnb let us alone. They simply didn't care less. You don't call someone two days before his/her departure. Airbnb and the host should have done their best to accommodate us. After all we were just asking for an extra fan. Not a big deal in reality but it would have helped make our holiday merrier. We won't be using Airbnb anymore. This small incident has ruined our holiday. You should be ashamed of your attitude."
"Since my wife and I arrived in Chiang Mai some 6 weeks ago to take up our first 3 weeks I have been asking questions --today while ion Phuket I finally got answers after talking to real people --can I suggest you leave trip advisor really alone if you need real answers or solutions --the site is dominated by people who seem to make very few posts themselves but ""poor it on"" those that do via honest reviews--like one party with one review on Dubai and multiple posts criticizing those that do review. Anyway after booking Airbnb in Chiang Mai for 3 weeks -a few weeks ago- we got concerned when we saw in the lift no stays under 30 days , if you use the pool etc and staying here less than 30 days you need to have the owner in attendance. Any way TODAY WE HAD OIT CONFIRMED THE GOVERNMENT IN THAILAND HAS BANNED AIRBNB! Cannot get it any clearer than that !!!"
So who is responsible for promoting AIRBNB locations in Thailand after earlier this year the Thai Government outlawed rentals of less than 30 days unless the properties involved are registered hotels. Not too many AIRBNB clients rent for more than 30 days consecutively. Summing up AIRBNB is basically outlawed in Thailand or do you have information that I do not
"airbnb if an online platform that only protects traveller.If you are a host, never do it"
I had a very bad experience with Airbnb reviews. The host lied about me and said I brought a dog into the condo and I was a bad customer for violating her rules. I called Airbnb to tell them I don't even own a dog and asked them to please remove the review. They refused and said they wouldn't remove the review based on my feelings. Unbelievable and bizarre experience. I would say you rent from them at your own risk. I don't think they have any standardized or regulated practices as say in the real estate or hotel industry. It's kinda the wild west with them so buyer beware.
"We read all the glowing reviews (there was not a negative one to be found) posted for Peaks Garden Condo in Chiang Mai and went ahead and booked for 3 weeks On arrival the sign in the lift said we were breaking Thai Law and yet not one reviewer had mentioned this --either they did not use the lift or they cannot read English. We would never have booked where we did if we had known the sign was there--it spoilt our holiday because over the 3 week period we were disinclined to use the pool , gym and sauna As I have mentioned elsewhere the reviews are not posted in date order which makes a mockery of accounting for legislative and other such changes over time. To the man without a dog--did you write a review first followed by the owners response--if so I see your problem--no right of comeback !!"
"Peter- for future reference, if you click on the host's profile pick you can see all the reviews, and from memory they seem to be in a more logical order. There were quite a few who mentioned the signs in the lift.https://www.airbnb.com.au/users/show/11293201Edited: 2 years ago "
"I opted to not write a review of my stay because while the condo was nice and had been remodeled a few months prior the host, Jill, was a nasty, difficult person. Her response to any complaint was to brag about her 92% approval rating. I thought it best to just move on until I saw her crazy review of me and bringing a dog into her place. I of course responded to her review and stated she was bold face lying. I offered to get a notorized affidavit from my attorney stating that I don’t own a dog and had no animals in the condo with me. They said the review was a matter of her feelings and my feelings and they weren’t going to get involved. They went on to say that was the end of the matter and told me to have a nice day. Absolute insanity. Never again with Airbnb. Don’t trust them"
"Post #179 --you continue to prove to ,me that you are a guru --or alternatively --not just a pretty face ==I opened those reviews that indicated the issue re the signs --it is interesting to note that when I booked many months ago those reviews weren't in place --proves that one should not book too early as it is the latest reviews that are of greatest relevance. So clearly the signs went up only a few months ago after the Thai Government apparently bought into the short term rental of apartments The other key point to note is that Nitiya owns 4 units in the block and the reviews that are shown are a combination of each of the units which is a tad misleading given we stayed in a one bedroom which could not be described as roomy compared to the 2 bedroom one she owns --so there needs to be separate reviews for each of the configurations she rents out"
post #180 --that is a disgrace --clearly they as in Airbnb and their hosts are a law unto themselves --there should be an ability to get an independent umpire to adjudicate issues like this. Was the owner an absentee owner ? If so more scope for making up untruths
"Airbnb was a great company a few years ago in my opinion. They have grown too big and don't care about the people that made them great now. Have a look at this website: https:/… This website is entitled AirBnb Hell, Uncensored Stories from Airbnb Hosts and Guests.I have used Airbnb as a guest about 35 times over the last few years. Always had legitimate exceptional reviews about being responsible and kind. There was never a host complaint. I suppose I was an exceptional AirBnb guest.A month ago I was renting in Hamburg and when I sat one time on a chair offered to me by the host it collapsed sending me to the floor (I'm 62). It hurt. I called the host and told him about his little chair. He immediately told me I would have to pay $550 for his favorite 45 yo chair. From my point of view he was trying to scam me. The chair was obviously in bad shape for it to fall apart just sitting down in proper fashiion. I explained to the host I would be happy to reimburse him if I did something wrong to the chair. I tried to find someone to repair the chair but was unable. After I left the property the host said the chair was irrepairable and I shold give him $550.I told him to speak with Airbnb because they might reimburse him. Airbnb sent an email to me asking if I intended to pay for the chair. I explained to them the chair was old and ready to fall apart when I sat on it. The next day I received an email from Airbnb stating I was no longer an Airbnb member. They cancelled several future bookings I had made in several countries and basically ruined my vacation. I was forced to take substandard more expensive bookings from other companies because of the short timeline to book at peak season. When I was finally able to make contact with an AirBnb rep weeks later I was told the decision was final. I can never use Airbnb again or stay at an Airbnb booking even on another member's booking."
post #182 --that is a very sad story and all I can say is I feel for you --the real problem is that AIRBNB is far too distant from the coal face--they appear to have no-one ensuring appropriate accountability on behalf of hosts where that becomes a requirement like it will from time to time like when we had no hot water in Dublin on one occasion. In that particular case the owner had young runners who were dispatched by push bike to handle matters which they appeared incapable of doing
My husband has been barred from trip advisor for probably being too perceptive in his reviews of Dubai so I am sending this message to Peter's long standing respondee in respect of AIRBNB and the rules that might apply in Thailand? --from memory CM was your code name--Query from Peter--Have you arrived at Peaks Garden ? Is the sign prohibiting rentals of less than 30 days still in the lift? Have you defied the rules as set down and used the facilities?f

"1120 S. Corning St. Los Angeles, CA 90035-2004 Kosher Rentals d/b/a David Leiner. A party of seven booked this property from August 8th to 13th in 2018. Upon arrival we found the property to be other than was depicted in the Airbnb webpage. We found where the proprietor indicated air conditioning there was only a low capacity air conditioner in the bedroom. It was insufficient to cool the whole apartment. The temperature never went below 80 degrees. The closets had a musty odor and although the apartment was clean there was an infestation in the kitchen preventing us from eating and using any part of the kitchen. He did indicate that he would send a housekeeper the next day. Four of the seven went to a hotel and the next day we joined them. 3 of us only stayed in the apartment 1 night. We were afraid to even sleep under the covers. This was a very bad experience especially since there 3 children in the party. 1 has Asthma."
"We usually use this web site. However it is not very reliable. The reason I mean here is the quality of the photos is very bad, not close to reality, the rooms are not close to what is advertised. The photos uploaded does not reflect the quality of rooms we actually see and get . Air bnb does not seem to scan those pictures , does not seem validate , does not seem screen them as a result customers do not get what is promised. Many times the phone number HOST provides is of a remote place and not reach able , which makes the customer feel unsafe and left out . the neighbourhoods that are dangerous is not screened, the customer is usually left on their own risk as most HOSTS do not give elaborate answers in terms of what is offered and what is not . Most times only super hosts are reliable and they are 4 times the regular price . Thus it is better to book a hotel rather than AIR BNB ."

"I have just had a terrible experience with an airbnb booking. I have used them extensively in the UK and Europe for a number of years and been very happy with the accommodation so had no hesitation in booking an apartment for a recent trip to New York. It was clear when we got there the photos used to promote the flat were some years out of date. The place was dirty with rags at the windows, stained upholstery, walls and ceilings. It was also not in a good neighbourhood. All completely contrary to the listing. We did as instructed and emailed the host and called airbnb. We uploaded pictures as evidence but were given no help to find alternative accommodation. We ended up having to book a not great hotel which was very expensive as we needed it that night. Despite calls and emails to airbnb they did nothing and although reimbursed us for the original accommodation we are left after 3 weeks of correspondence hundreds of pounds out of pocket. I won’t risk using them again as there is no customer support when you need it."
If you had cared to do any research at all you would have found that nearly all short term rentals in NYC are illegal.

"Well, I booked a place two days ago and went through and confirmed using my credit card. Two days later today when I tried to book another place, they asked for my government PHOTO ID for booking. I am not going to put my PHOTO ID online or on app. I just want to book a night to stay. In my opinion, this is a bit too much."
"I agree with you. It would be too much for me, too. I wouldn't provide my ID just to book, I'd look elsewhere."
"Not worth the bother or the money. I stayed in Copenhagen and was not at all satisfied with my room. I stayed in a basement where I couldn't look the front door. The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write at scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it (they said) but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all. Stay at a decent hotel or don't go at all is my suggestion.https://www.airbnb.se/rooms/6243862…"
"Unfortunately I also had a very bad experience and decided not to use that again. I have always have excellent experience just using booking.com, much more serious and responsable."
"I also had a very bad experience with them. I will not use that again. I preferred continue using Bookin.com, much more serious and responsable."
"Just had the worst experience with AirBnB....it's hit and miss with them. I've had good experiences also...but this last one just knocked my confidence with them out of the ball park. We arrived at the Manhattan apartment, only to find it had been ""delisted"" by Airbnb more than 3 weeks prior to our arrival date...SOMEONE FORGOT TO TELL US!!! They offered us a refund or to try to re accommodate us. I said ""refund please""....no confidence in their system at all. Oh, and they were happy to take our money well AFTER the delisting, AND to remind us 2 days before our arrival that we should enjoy our Airbnb trip to NY! Go figure. Use at your peril."
If you had bothered with the slightest bit of research you would have found that almost ALL short term rentals in NYC are illegal and that the authorities are gradually shutting them down.
Happily it's not just New York that is choosing to impose restrictions on Air BnB properties.
"I will never ever use AirBNB again. The previous time I tried to use them it went wrong with the host demanding a 50% price hike the day before we were due to travel. Airbnb were totally useless about sorting this, so we ended up staying in a horrible Days Inn in Baltimore, being the only hotel that had space in the conference season. Against my better judgement, my wife persuaded me to use them again for a trip to New York, leaving next Tuesday. The first booking was cancelled three weeks ago, as the host had forgotten that she was having the apartment refurbished. Wow, you would really forget that, wouldn't you? She also forgot to inform Airbnb, so I had to make a number of phone calls to arrange a refund, which takes up to two weeks.We found another apartment, albeit not as convenient for the relatives we are visiting, on the upper east side. Paid in full and thought: ""Well that's sorted"". Today I received a message from Airbnb saying that the booking does not mean their Terms of Service (whatever that means), so they are cancelling it and I will receive a refund in due course. We are leaving in two days and we have no accommodation in New York. Last time I will ever use these useless dorks. Wilson"
Short term rental in NYC is nearly all illegal.
"If that is the case, then AirBNB should not be offering NY short term rentals"
"Airbnb accept placements of properties for rent and do not vet them. Homeaway, VRBO, TripAdvisor and others do the same. You would do well to go to the NYC website and read the third Top Question down (on a computer not mobile device) to understand the problem.Similar situations are arising with many cities around the world clamping down on short term rentals. Enquires/research on the location destination forum is an absolute must if considering a short term rental."
"Just my own opinion, but I think that the rise of AirBnB has led other sites like TA, Homeaway and even Booking.com to enter the holiday rental market. Unfortunately, the lack of any vetting by all of these sites has just played into the hands of unscrupulous owners and criminals."
"Yes, sites like Airbnb, Agoda, Hotels.com and Booking,com have these illegal private Singapore apartment rentals listed/displayed and people are getting caught. I guess they (all the booking sites) make money from the bookings so will keep displaying them, even though Singapore has housing laws prohibiting short term rentals for periods of under 3 months. I think it’s wrong and the booking sites and owners should be adhering to local laws. They are aware of them but I guess it’s just business to them."

"I've used Airbnb many times and never once had a problem until now. BE AWARE of anything in the Host descriptions stating that ""additional information may be required"" means that Airbnb has allowed this Host to ask for private information to check for a criminal background, sex offenders and other private information that Airbnb has allowed the Host to profile, discriminate and DENY your stay in that Host property. Airbnb will not support the customer (renter) and refuses to refund the complete amount of money because apparently it is the customers (renter) responsibility to inquire what this ""additional information"" is before making a reservation. Airbnb is making a huge profit on our (the public) renting properties through them and do not stand behind us. Not sure how this makes you feel but to me this is completely wrong and should be illegal. I never once have had this happen in a hotel, resort, casino. No where in the US is this alright but for some reason Airbnb has allowed these policies to be ok for the Host to discriminate it's people. With all the equal rights we have in this country, a huge company like Airbnb is allowing a Host to discriminate. PLEASE BE AWARE of this. I have tons of correspondence between me and Airbnb, the Host managers company for proof. Like I said I have used Airbnb many, many times in the last 4 years and never ran into this until now. I'm sure they will reply with something on the lines of. Oh we are so sorry and it is the responsibility of us (the renters) to ask what ""additional information"" is before reserving a room and basically that it's not Airbnb responsibility to make sure that its users (renter) are protected and safe. I hope that someone out there reads this and has the money and time to slap them with a law suit. Discrimination and profiling of the public is not ok."
">>>Airbnb is making a huge profit on our (the public) renting properties through them and do not stand behind us.<<<You can easily turn that around and say that AirBnb is making a huge profit by owners renting out their properties through the company. It's all a matter of perspective, isn't it? I'm no fan of AirBnB, but I'm very much in favour of individuals and companies having the right to decide who they wish to do business with. If their decision is discriminatory and against the law in that part of the world, then that is something for the local courts.If it's not illegal then you're entitled to your opinion that it should be, but I don't see the problem, sorry."
We use VRBO and TripAdvisor. We've never had a problem. Would highly recommend them.
"Jeannette, vacation rentals don’t go through Tripadvisor, they go through companies like FlipKey and HolidayLettings. I’m surprised you have had good experiences with them as there are many complaints over on the Support forum about vacation rental bookings started from a Tripadvisor page."
"BUYER BEWARE!!!!! Airbnb is GREAT... until it's NOT. I was an avid Airbnb patron for many years - hosting and staying. But then I had my first problem... an owner who lied about their place and was unresponsive once I arrived. I had paid $780 for a monthly rental - I stayed overnight with no internet, stove and a malfunctioning heater (it was freezing in Malta). The owner refused to give a refund so the great Airbnb staff got involved and got me a whopping $500 refund! So I paid $250 for a fraudulent one night stay! HORRIBLE! Will never ever use them again - because when will that next problem occur???"
Recently made a booking with air bnb for a place in Albany West Australia. Web site wanted me to provide a picture of my drivers licence and update my profile picture. In order to do this I had to load their app onto my phone. Did all that and from then on the site would not work correctly and would lock me out periodically.They took my money in a flash but due to the faulty web site and hopeless lack of communication from the host I decided to cancel. After gaining access at last to the web site and looking at booking page it said $46 handling fee to cancel. Thought OK I am prepared to pay that to be free of the hassle. The second I hit cancel a window came up that said Zero refund !? Made a complaint to air bnb who said they could only refund if host approved. Host has still not replied to me or them. 7 days later after daily e mails to resolution centre they have offered a 50% refund. Still not happy. How can you have a host who takes your money then is not contactable ? Beware of the white house at Emu point.Don't waste your money with air bnb. Now that other booking sites are allowing people to host their apartments and houses use them instead.
Don't trust the reviews. Over 59 reviews said that https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/17613203… was a clean place to stay. Pillows with stains that smelled like vomit and all sheets soaking wet hung over heaters. Wi-Fi not funtioning.
Hi. Air BNB is losing track record my friend. Exact same happened with me in Montreal. They do not and can not fix it as of now. So please do not trust in my opinion.
Whatever you do don't book Air BnB. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. They couldn't get me rebooked and I have an entire work crew now without a place to stay.
Where was this?
"Agree totally. Airbnb is getting from bad to worse. Had a horrible experience in Tokyo recently, the host apparently double booked my apartment, a big group came knocking on the door at 9pm , and the host came later and tried to force herself into the apartment with her spare key. Totally rude and uncivilised. With the help of the police , we moved out to the hotel at midnight. What more with the cleaning charge and service fee , Airbnb is no more cheap . With dishonest hosts and double booking , it is really unreliable. Airbnb is just keen to profit from commission and forgo quality and reliability.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Stay away from Airbnb. AVOID AT ALL COSTI had to cancel and they agreed to 50% return of my money. Paid $496.68, refunded $149.31(missing $100). Minus their fee that I pay and NOT the host of $56(should have been $248-$56=$192). Still missing difference ($100) and they won't refund me, saying I received the whole refund. Complete scam and they are protected by their own cancellation rules and policies. There are better ways to do business and its not with them. Case managers dont have the decency to call you and discuss issue with you, only made their conclusions based on their notes. ***UPDATE***3 weeks have passed and still no refund. I worked with 8 case managers over a course of 3 weeks. NOTHING BUT A WASTE OF TIME. I have their emails that clearly states my refund!!!! Now, they have decided to close my account based on their privacy policy and with NO explanation. I never swore, or insulted or threatened anyone. The money is already in the host's pocket. They new they messed up and wanted to get rid of me. All hope is now lost for my remaining refund.Not professional at all and to be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS no matter if its cheaper!!!! Not worth the stress and headaches because you will NEVER win! Even if you report them, their policies protect them and you will just waste your time and hard earned money. They are NOT there to make your plans easier but simply to protect their hosts and fees. No remorse, even if you have a valid reason ""no passport"". STAY AWAY!!!"
"We stupidly chose a fantastic ""appearing"" apartment in Barcelona. We were a bit confused why there hadn't been any reviews for the previous 8 months. Once we arrived, we understood why. Not fully understanding the airbnb review posting policy, we didn't realize that many bad reviews were simply not posted. So disappointing. Since then, we've stayed at a few great places and other locations that were super disappointing (loud, no hot water, etc.) even though the reviews seemed very positive and - wait for it - these were all ""superhosts""! I think it's a crapshoot. Look for abodes with lots of positive reviews that are very current. Otherwise, you never know."

"I'm sure that the reviews are genuine, but if anything goes wrong such as AirBnb cancelling your booking (as happened with us, 2 days before travelling) then you can't actually leave a bad review (or any review in fact), so it's very likely that there would be a lot more reviews which would have been left by dissatisfied customers."
"We recently (December 2018) used AirBNB for our 3 week trip to Italy. We stayed at four different properties in three different cities. Three of them were excellent and lived up to the pictures and the reviews. One, in Rome, was dirtier than we liked. We notified the owner, he sent over a cleaning crew and we made do. It was fine for the most part. HOWEVER.....When we came home and posted our review we included praise for the responsiveness of the owner but acknowledged the cleanliness issue and the dated/cramped nature of the bathroom. The owner of that property has never posted a review of US as AirBNB renters and our review of his property has never appeared on his page. Obviously if the owner declines to review the renter they also can block a less than stellar review from posting on the property. We will continue to use AirBNB for travel, but it will be with a healthy dose of skepticism and a generalized plan for how we will deal with it should we get a truly bad situation."
No Responsibility!We recently rented our apartment through Airbnb. Their idiot guest heated a French press on the stove to red hot then placed it on the kitchen counter burning a hole and causing $1000.00 in damage. Airbnb would not pay for the damages. I guess it’s ok for their guests to damage your property. It’s not their money!
The guest should pay for damages. It is not AirBnB that burnt the counter.
That's not fair. The quest should pay. I don't like air BNB for the way they just flip you off as if they are some higher power.
"DO NOT USE airbnb. We rented a place in Venice, Italy. We were sent pictures prior to payment and arrival. Once we got there it was not the place we rented, they did a bait and switch. We were never compensated for the small dirty place.We just rented a home out of state for our son's college graduation for family. Just last week they cancelled, 3 weeks prior left us scurrying for a new rental. There are other college graduations in the area and it's Memorial Day weekend so we are having difficulty. They did not refund us our $1,500.00 deposit but they debited our credit card for the balance of the rental! We called customer service (out of the US) and we were told our rental was valid. We have the email stating it was cancelled. After going round and round we were told we could receive a credit toward a future rental. That is not acceptable, we will never use Airbnb again. We are waiting for our refund and if we do not receive it in a timely manner I will file fraud charges and call my bank. Bottom line is DO NOT USE AIRBNB."
"I stayed in miami beach with Seacoast for 7 days for $5000. The place looked nothing like the pictures. the building was run down, the elevators and hallways smelled. The appliances didnt work and I didnt get the 2 rooms rooms together as I requested for 10 people. I was very disappointed it was a terrible experience. I messaged the host of my concerns and she stopped her communicaiton to me. I then contacted Airbnb I sent them pictures of the place and my complaints...they did nothing about it and the guy case manager was a jerk and actually lied to me. The customer service sucked! do not book a place for this muhc money with airbnb. Really bad experience for me and my 10 guests who flew from south america. I was expecting an average place...this was a motel 8 experience for $5000. Never again with airbnb."
Airbnb is a scam. They are only to take people's money for poor service or no service rendered at all. My family and I will no longer be using Airbnb. I have to get a lawyer to recoup money that was stolen with not services given to my family at all. It is in your best interest to never conduct business with them again! My advice
"I have rented through AIRBNB about six times, most recently in Lucca. I rent exclusively now from Superhosts.The properties have all been as advertised.Hotel chains can have the same problems, with properties ranging greatly from city to city.I’ve booked through VRBO and several of the other sites without significant problems. When I do I dig deeply into the reviews on the site as well as TA and other review sites. Then I make a decision.One other observation, I see many of those complaining have just joined TA and have no other posts. This is common across other forums and makes me wonder at their motivation."
"Never ever will I use Air B and B again. I had a dreadful experience in Oslo where the toilet was leaking all over the floor, the apartment itself smelled of dog and the pillows, towels and bed linen looked as if it was for use on animals.When I complained the host left a counter claim where she lied and said I had left the flat in a ""huge mess"".I complained and had photographic evidence to show I hadn't , one Air B and B supervisor took that down and the following week it went back up again.................First and last time I will ever use Air B and B ....they side with the host, they only care about filling houses , they don't care about your experience..............."

I am never using airbnb again. I posted a true negative review. The host took down the listing snd reposted it under a slightly different name.She then trashed me as a guest.

I left a negative review for a host and they never posted it. All reviews for the host were positive. They censor your reviews. Beware
"I rented an apartment in Reykjavik, Iceland for 3 nights. The host had nothing but positive reviews and advertising a ""quiet residential neighborhood"". From the moment we unlocked the door, there was construction noise from a nearby street (jackhammering) all day. When that finally stopped, the upstairs neighbors started banging all night as if they had their own construction site going on upstairs. I tried to let it go the first night and didn't say anything. Then it happened again the second night until 3am. Then again the 3rd night when I finally said something at midnight. The host didn't take any responsibility and Airbnb asked me for ""documentation"". Then I wrote a negative review about the noise and they never posted it. It's rigged to make them money and avoid negative reviews. Beware! I'll never use Airbnb again."
This is my biggest gripe with airbnb. We are finding out that owners can cancel your reservation and email you offering a much higher rate. I have been wasting my time trying to book a unit for a few months from now. Turns out there are some owners putting lower prices on and then they cancel your reservation. It is a complete waste of time and airbnb has been allowing this since at least 2016. It is a scam and waste of time.
"Totally false wrong information from Shannon. As an Airbnb host myself i know the rules. If I cancel a booking I loose straight away any Super host status I have plus the booking charges. Repeated cancellations result in charges of up to £100 per booking. So no host in there right mind would ever do this it makes no sense and is financial lunacy. Yes hosts sometimes do have to cancel and will but its rare, and those that have a history of cancelling too often will very quickly find there accounts suspended. I have been a super host for over a year. Hosted for 100s of people and rare had any issues either as a host or as a guest. Allot of what is written in this thread is total mis information. I have used airbnb all over the world and only had 1 negative encounter/ stay. Airbnb not for everyone for sure but as a way to see the world on a budget its great with excellent support if things go wrong. I know as I have used it both as guest and host."
"Currently, my wife and I are staying in an illegally sublet unit. This is the second time this has happened to us through Airb&b. I don’t know how many illegal rentals are posted by people attempting to bypass their condo or rental rules, but it wouldn’t surprise me if there are many. So far, I’m batting 66% of my stays as illegal. Today, the management of this rental informed me that I was renting illegally. When I heard that, I had bad memories of the last time this happened to me. When I rent a unit, I fully expect my stay will be legal. I sent the following complaint to Airb&b: “You need to do something about this issue. I plan to put a warning on trip advisor to prospective renters that they should be sure to check with the building’s management before they sign a rental agreement. A good starting place is to ask the host whether the unit meets the legal requirements of the building. My guess is that the host will not tell the truth. Let me know what you intend to do about these illegal rentals.”I don’t mean to impugn owners of properties they wish to rent. My warning is intended to spare prospective renters the embarrassment of finding themselves charged with renting illegally, as I have now twice."
"Getaway,Private apartment rentals in Singapore listed on Airbnb are all illegal. Singapore has housing laws which prohibit owners from renting out their apartments for short stays of under 3 months. But these owners know the law and still list them on Airbnb (and other booking websites). There are quite a few cities around the world which prohibit short term rentals.On the Singapore forum on Tripadvisor we have warnings about these Airbnb illegal rentals as well as general warnings about booking private rentals. Some people see those warnings and decide to book a hotel. Some innocently come on our forum saying what they have booked and we need to tell them they have booked something illegal, and advise them they can and should contact Airbnb and demand a full refund. It’s unfortunate many tourists don’t check laws in various cities before making their bookings. People have faced lots of problems, like turning up and the owner has been reported so the guest is locked out and left on the street and have to immediately find other accommodation. Or the owner contacts them before their stay asking them to say they are a friend or cousin if anyone in the complex confronts them and asks why they are there. Owners don’t want to get caught, so try and get guests to tell lies.It’s an awful situation and these tourists who don’t know about the laws are being used by these owners. Airbnb is making money from these bookings, and they know about the laws in Singapore. I’d never ever book anything on Airbnb."
"I have tried to book a few properties on Airbnb for next summer recently, and have had similar replies. Either the rates are wrong, or the property isn’t available for some reason.However, when I look at the same place again the cost to book it has risen considerably.In the UK we have a law that says if you see something advertised, the price you see is the price you pay, or you can sue them. It appears this does not apply to Airbnb.This is my first experience of using Airbnb, and I am beginning to think there are a lot of crooks and con artists on it."
"weatherman, what law are you referring to? I don't know of one, but I'll be glad to learn."
"Some airbnb hosts will not accept certain bookings such as if the guest is new to airbnb without any reviews.Or the property getting booked while your looking would make the dates unavailable. Prices do not rise but only the base lowest price is shown on the initial listing. When you go to book any extras are then added such as the cleaning fee, or if you choose additional services that a host may offer. Also prices are always converted in your own currency on the booking page so there will be fluctuation in prices. So nothing underhand here Weatherman ...and what law do you refer to ? please let me know so I can check it. Airbnb is not for everyone but it is a very solid reliable platform for both hosts and guests. I have been a superhost for over a year now and love it as do the many 100s of guests I have had the pleasure of having in my home. And personally I have used airbnb all over the world without any issues."
"One of the people that did this was a superhost, the price almost doubled overnight. I am fully aware of the extras. If a UK based company advertised at holiday rental for say £200 including extras, that is what you would pay. They would not be allowed to make some excuse to not allow you book, and then increase the price for the same dates."

"In general a hotels or hostels or apartments description that does not reflect the true condition of a property seems to be one of the more common issues, if you read through the reviews of the relevant portals, although it can ruin an entire trip in cases where the discrepancies are substantial. Considering the total number of bookings in the industry it happens (btw, monitoring someones every move is not limited to Airbnb either). Although I have not been using Airbnb often in the past they recently applied what they published as their official policies and provided me with a refund."
Don't believe the posted prices. My latest was advertised at $200/day and ended up costing $700 after pst-booking price changes and fees. Be sure to double-check ALL fees and ensure the price is what was advertised.
"My daughter and I are jointly paying for a residence in Talkeetna, AK. My daughter has paid the first half. When I tried to pay the balance online, I set up my email and password with airbnb; but I was denied access to the reservation. I called them, and they told me that my daughter had to call airbnb and put me in their system as a contact. She did this. I once again logged in to airbnb, but could not accomplish final payment. The system just gave me a big DUH when I entered the reservation number. Once again I called airbnb, and after they gave me the third degree, they would not let me make the final payment. Now they are sending my daughter and email with a link to Airbnb, and she will give them my credit card information for the final payment.I will never again use or be a part of using airbnb."
"The place I booked at stellar reviews too. It was in Apple Valley, CA and there were no dog-friendly hotels near enough for me to get my dog to her nosework trial in time. So I used Bring Fido to find a place and AirBnB was listed. I found a home close that was dog friendly. The reviews were stellar. I booked on May 5. I contacted them on August 23 to confirm and ask if I could bring guests as it was a two room suite (for a total of $142.25) and I really only needed one bed. They said sure I could. I had the entire two room suite. When I showed up to check in the hostess was shocked. She thought I had canceled because another party had shown up the day before for a three day booking in the two room suite. She went online and no, I had not canceled. This other couple had booked through a different company. The hostess has double booked but she wouldn't admit it. I had no place to go. They had a small 10x10 room for me. Had to share the bathroom. The room was so small they had to remove a chair so i could set up the dog crate. They brought in a TV and plugged in a bar fridge. But I was still charged $142.25 for this closet with a bed. When I complained the hostess said I could have the two room suite for free for one night of a future booking. What good is that to me? I'll probably never return to this dinky town out in the middle of the desert. When I got home I saw that I had booked first and should have had priority AND that they had confirmed I could bring guests on August 23, six weeks AFTER they double booked it. They're just lucky I didn't bring my parents with me as I would have gone online, confirmed my May 5 reservation and then kicked that other family out of MY suite. In my opinion, never use AirBnB or any other similar agency. They take no responsibility and you have no recourse when you are swindled except to work it out with your hosts. Good luck with that. From now on I'll only stay in real hotels. You know what you're getting, what you're paying and you can always take them to court."
"To post a review on Airbnb, u must first have an account. And the account must be verified using your ID and photo. Then u must book a stay and paid for it using your credit card to Airbnb. After your stay date then you will be allowed to do the posting of review.As for the beautiful and fantastic pictures, Airbnb send their own photographer to go the owner place to snap them in professionally and post on your listing for the owner. Payment that you made will go to Airbnb, never direct to the owner. And transfer of your payment to the owner will alway be after your stay in case there are any fraud or discrepancy of the home when u arrived there and stayed.Period.Edited: 5:50 pm, October 27, 2019 "
"""As for the beautiful and fantastic pictures, Airbnb send their own photographer to go the owner place to snap them in professionally and post on your listing for the owner.""That must be one very busy and well travelled photographer then."
"@Frommy... Speaking from experience of a few Airbnb listings previously and they have someone or a group in each location. How big a spot one photographer covers I wouldn't know but each unit a different one came as my units were located in different cities. Appointment also depends on how busy the person is for how soon they can come to take the pics before posting it on your listing. Does that answer your doubt? :)Edited: 2:30 am, October 28, 2019 "
"I have stayed at ABnB's around the US, Cuba and Europe. Rarely do you see anything below 5 stars. It's a crap shoot. I found the Euro photos are professionally taken, often, and do not resemble the reality. For us, it's always been hit or miss."
"Do not use Airbnb. I went through the whole ID process and they gladly took my booking and deposit for NYC apartment and when I conducted research afetr learning at Airbnb was illegal in NYC, the host when challenged advised his apartment was illegal but not enforced. When I spoke to Airbnb re the cancellation and refund they advised it met their approval even though I advised them the host said different. Airbnb were able to view the email exchange between myself and the host and tried to distance themselves from the topic of NY accommodation."
"One Trouble with reviews is even when disasters happen to you on holiday in one of the properties AirBnB encourage you to leave a positive review, as you have to leave a review within a set time so issues are usually not resolved with renters so early, so your unaware if the renter is doing as promised, most once they get a descent review refuse to help you."
"Further to my last entry, last night I spoke to Airbnb and they were only going to refund part of my deposit due to cancellation terms and conditions,namely AU$1312.74 of the AU $1705.63 deposit. I wasn't overly happy about that but considered it a loss due to my ignorance that Airbnb was a world wide legitimate business. I advised both the host Alex and Airbnb that I was going to pass on all the information, including screenshots of the hosts admission to operation an illegal business to a number of NY government departments provided to me and left it at that. This morning (01/01/2020) I noted that Airbnb had also refund to my Paypal account the money they had previously said they would retain.It all starts to make sense now, why one particular host was advertising a nice apartment but no reviews since 2016 and still no response from my direct query to him for any recent reviews. And then there was the apartment the the hostess was described as a prison governor and requesting guests not talk to neighbours, which I gather would indicate short term rental occurring.I have just checked the Airbnb site and despite Alex @ Peaceful apt by the central park admitting to running an illegal rental apartment and Airbnb being fully aware of such, it's still business as usual. Doesn't really say much for the integrity of the whole process.Certainly a lesson learnt by me and hopefully sharing my experience will assist others.Regards,Bob"
"Bob,It is not just NYC where there are illegal short term rentals (STR) listed on Airbnb, VRBO, HomeStay or other listings, even Booking.com now. The best thing to do if considering a STR is research by using/asking on the city destination forum."
"Yes, Singapore also has laws prohibiting short term private rentals for periods of under 3 months. The problem used to mainly just be AirBnb, but they are also advertised on Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Agoda, Hotels.com etc.Tourists who didn’t think to check local laws or fully research the destination before booking can end up in a mess. So I agree about using the Tripadvisor destination forums to research all aspects of a trip. Bob, save or bookmark this forums homepage link below so you can check things out before you book anything, and the forums are usually full of warning topics about those rentals:- https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ForumHome"
"Thank you everyone for your input. We have been organising our holidays for many years without incident and it is only this occasion where we decided to get NYC off the bucket list and the hotel I've also booked is reasonably expensive so thought I would look at the cheap option of Airbnb. Fortunately I came out of the experience unscathed.Regards,Bob"
"We got a full refund from them including owners fees, as we were robbed but it was obvious it was set up to appear to be a break in, when the security grill and door had to have been opened from the inside prior to the barrels etc being taken out! Only our money valuables were taken, nothing of the owners despite expensive items which could have been taken easily! Its always in hindsight after the fact you hit yourself for being so gullible and trusting. Never trust any key holder etc unless you have been going for years to the same place without incident!"
"I'm using them right now.I used Airbnb to locate a room for a month in Hua Hin in Thailand.Through Airbnb I found a room in a Condo close to the Airport.When I arrived the host was welcoming and the room looked fine however, I soon realised things were not as they appeared. The room had obviously not been used for many years as the coffee and coffee mate provided was 4 and 5 years out of date respectively and the bed had apparently been left made up for the next customer for the same period.After a week of feeling uncomfortable in the bed at night I stripped the bed linens for washing and found to my horror that somebody in the past had left huge blood stains on the matrass topper and the duvet directly under the area of the pillows. I pointed this out to the host but he didn't see as it was a problem.Since then I've been trying to get Airbnb to help resolve the problem but they have ignored me completely.I would recommend you give Airbnb a wide birth and look elsewhere for accommodation."
"Our host at ""Dancing Turtle"" in Kihei on Maui canceled on us the night before we were to arrive. We had had the reservation for nine months. Looking at some reviews on Google that were posted right afterwards, pretty sure they got a better deal at the last minute on their own site and canceled our reservation. What kind of a miserable human being does that? No morals whatsoever. They should be kicked off Airbnb."
"Have you told AirBnB what happened, and if so what did they say?"
"Forget the reviews..it's a crap shoot. Look at photos, directly communicate asking questions..We stayed in some less than wonderful places that had glowing reviews. One even had NO WINDOWS and one door to exit..it was terrifying..crappy plastic flowers everywhere and the bottle of wine gifted to us was .99 Euros!! It was vinegar. The fees are adding up as well so a simple 150.00 a night place ends up being 250.00 with fees. Stick with small properties and locally owned..."
"I tend to agree. I haven't even tried AirBnB because I'm not confident that all will be as it seems from photo's, information and reviews."
Airbnb host myself and I agree that only guests are allowed to review and that cleanliness and perceptions differ
"I searched on Airbnb's website for hours for the right place to stay with my family of four at a decent price. After deciding, reserving, and paying through PayPal, I received an email at almost 3:00 in the morning. I was advised that a system error had caused the listing to show $115 a night plus applicable fees / taxes when in fact the cost was $275 a night, before the fees and taxes. Hey Airbnb, I'm not sure who is checking their emails at 3:00 a.m. but I have a 9-5 job, so I sleep at night. I saw the email later in the morning, after I had already told my family about the nice vacation that we would be taking. The reservation was automatically canceled and I was basically told ""oh well... tough on you."" Of course I was offered ""comparable places"" that I had already spent hours sifting through and passed up for the reservation that I made. ""Comparable""... I don't think so. There are other vacation rental sites out there and I will be using one of them from now on. TERRIBLE customer service and I have asked that my account be deleted and suggest you do the same. I will retire in 5 years and will be doing a lot of traveling at that point. Not only will I not book any of the trips through Airbnb, I will tell my story to anyone who will listen during my travels."
"First time using Airbnb. What a faff! They wanted, as well as our credit card details, a photo of my wife's passport. I foolishly went to the effort of complying with this odd performance after sending card details. Then grew paranoid enough to phone the bank and cancelled the credit card. It was probably kosher but felt very uncomfortable. Upshot is, no more Airbnb for me!"
Totally agree - don’t trust any reviews and never book long stays (30 plus days) unless you have viewed the Airbnb yourself. Walked away after one night as the property had just been flooded and lost all of my prepaid amount. AirBNB complaints were totally useless and my negative review of the property was never posted against the property. Very disappointing as I have had wonderful experiences with AirBNB before. Never again
"I do not trust Airbnb. I just booked a room from them for what I thought was a good deal, then I got a message from the renter that I owed him $357 more dollars. Like heck I'm paying any more than what was listed! Scam, bait and switch! No way would I trust this person once they did that, so I was able to get the charges reversed through my bank in time. Do not trust this site! If they would do this, I have no doubt that they would leave fake reviews. So many scammers out there these days! Beware!"
I’ve used Airbnb a lot with good results very much of the time. Take the time to read every single review about a place. Some may mention something important to you. I’ve always seen my reviews posted as I wrote them.

"Actually, that is what Airbnb is designed for. People to make money. Some hosts may choose to refund a portion, and that is generous. But a cancelled event is not something they have control over and you could still stay in their property, it is your choice not to."
Airbnb will not issue refund for coronavirus to Europe. What a run around and rip off!
"Not surprising. There are many places that are not refunding non-refundable rooms, flights, etc. T&C are important to know when booking."
Tried again today and just a complete runaround! Save yourself the trouble and use another site.
"Airbnb's accommodations are not cheaper than hotels. Most of the hosts from Airbnb do not change the bed sheet, linen like they do at hotels. They only change them if they are visibly dirty, and we think that these aren't changed between guests. We have dirty bed sheets and dirty linen every single time we stay in Airbnb accommodations. The reviews on the website are not accurate. I also posted a few honest reviews but I've never seen them on the listing.Edited: 8:49 am, March 22, 2020 "
"No refund for my trip arriving in Spain on April 17th. Spain has completely closed all borders and flights until at least April 22nd and Spain has more Coronavirus deaths than any other nation in the World. AIRBNB and Andrew in San Sebastian are trying to profit from Coronavirus. Andrew currently has five listings in San Sebastian, he advertises it is a ""perfect Coronavirus escape."" Do not fall for this evil type of profiting from a horrible disease."
"https://www.lcwlegal.com/news/vendor-contrac…If a business contract does not have a force majeure provision, courts excuse a breach of contract (and the corresponding obligations of the parties) when an unforeseeable event makes performance impracticable or impossible. The doctrine of impracticability excuses performance of a contract obligation when an unforeseeable event makes performance extremely difficult or expensive. The doctrine of impossibility excuses performance of a contract obligation when an unforeseeable event makes performance literally impossible."
Hotels don't keep your money for 5- 15 days. Your refund is given right back to get another hotel and a host that just cancels for no reason and advertises is discrimination. I am not tesding that in their fine print. Don't use airbnb not worth the hassel
"Due to covid, we had to recently cancel our two different locations we booked with Airbnb. They did not refund our deposits form either location. Tried calling airbnb and they were not helpful either trying to fight for the customer's rights. I mean it's not like we didnt want to travel, we had to cancel because of covid. Very upset about this whole thing between airbnb being uncommunicative and the host ofmthe properties not refunding. Will dispute it with my credit card company. Beware u will lose your deposit should you have to cancel."
"Mary S, I am having a similar problem with Air BnB. I had to cancel a reservation for May, and they are refusing to refund me. Over $500 lost. It is making me feel very reluctant to ever use Air BnB in the future. I feel like they are really damaging their reputation with the poor customer service they are giving during this pandemic."
"Customers rights according to the terms and conditions. I know you feel you deserve your money back, but that may not be what you agreed to. Upholding those terms is not poor customer service."
It is in the midst of a pandemic. The companies that go above and beyond are the ones that are going to survive.
Have you contacted your credit card company?
">>The companies that go above and beyond are the ones that are going to survive<<No. The companies that go above and beyond are the ones that will go broke. Especially if they give cash refunds.The virus pandemic is not the fault of the people renting apartments, but it is not the fault of the apartment owners either. They still have to meet the costs of mortgage, taxes, body corporate, and so on. They do not have the money to make cash refunds.If you pay for anything on a non-refundable basis, then you take the risk of being out of pocket is anything goes wrong."
Air BnB is giving money to it's hosts to keep them afloat. I read it on their website last night. $250 million. It is the companies with good customer service that I will support with my travel dollars after this is over. And Air Bnb is at the bottom of the list. Even if they would have offered a voucher for that amount for future stays I would have been OK with that.
"Airbnb capitalizes on covid-19 for profit! Our family had to cancel our trip from New York to France for obvious reasons, and our host in Paris was kind enough to refund our deposit in full. But Airbnb kept their service charge and will not refund it! These reviews are spot on, shame on you Airbnb for taking advantage of decent American families at a time like this."
I don't see keeping the service fee is taking advantage.
"sydneynick that may be consistent with consumer law in your jurisdictionit's not consumer law in minekeeping the money whilst not offering the service is called unjust enrichment, and is not generally legal"

">>>keeping the money whilst not offering the service is called unjust enrichment, and is not generally legal<<<It could be argued that an AirBnB owner is providing the service but the customer can't get to it. I'm not saying that such an argument would succeed, but I reckon it would make for a very interesting court case and judgement, whatever the outcome."
"Airbnb, the company provided their portion of the service."
"Update on my dispute with Air BnB in regards to a non-refundable reservation in May. Under their extenuating circumstances policy they wanted a government document or website stating that travel is not allowed. On Thursday our Alberta government rolled out their re-opening plan and it clearly states that travel is not recommend. I sent that to them, and lo and behold I got an email this morning saying I was getting a full refund! So they have redeemed themselves somewhat in my eyes. They did not make it easy, but I just kept plugging away figuring I had nothing to lose. They have extended the date that they will refund up to June 15 (from May 31)."

"Geoff, when was your trip booked for? Their extenuating circumstance policy currently covers reservations up to June 15. If yours was after that, keep watching their website for the dates to be extended, and then submit your documentation and it should be approved. I agree they are not making it easy."
Airbnb is a ripoff I would say to be honest and wouldn’t ever use them! The first place I ever rented off of Airbnb was a rv and paid 1300 dollars and got there and the place was basically falling apart my son got bit up by something and it smelt moldy. Learned my first time to never use them. They don’t go out to inspect these places so I don’t trust it and they are all so highly expensive!! Plus 12% tax is ridiculous
"I agreeAirbnb is a rip offI found this out when trying to book somewhere for 28 days that cost more than 1 month (by some considerable margin) but I couldn't book for the month because someone had already booked the extra days.Though 12% tax has nothing to do with them, that will be the charge levied by the jurisdiction that the accommodation is located in. In effect a tourist tax on such accommodation."
"Never book with Airbnb. This company is terrible and very difficult to deal with if you ever encounter any problems. I had a trip booked for June 3 to 7, 2020 for a National event/competition. Due to COVID19, the event was cancelled. As soon I found out, I cancelled my booking but was not fully refunded. Airbnb chose to keep the service fee since the booking was 3 days past their ""Extenuating Circumstances"" period. Few weeks after I cancelled my booking, Airbnb extended their ""Extenuating Circumstances"" to the end of June. I asked for my service fee refund and denied since at the time I cancelled my booking, their EC period ended by end of May. Also Airbnb only allow you 24 hrs to response to their response. If you unable to check your email, they automatically close your inquire and make it very, very, very difficult to reach out to them."
"Have to say, my first (and last) booking with AirB&B truly revealed where their priorities lie. I booked a vacation rental (house) for 30 days. Virtually all the reviews were reasonably good, but these were older reviews. There was one very recent review, however, and this one was horrific. Knowing that people in general like to complain - and the review seemed like an outlier - I just wrote it off as an exception. On line, the property as described looked perfectly OK. But I was wrong. The place was truly a nightmare. The guy who had written the bad review hit the nail solidly on the head. The place was filthy, with the whole house smelling strongly of mildew, no reliable running water, furniture that was broken or run-down. No working TV. I didn't even bother to check the WiFi (a must have for me), because I could tell by looking at the installation that it wouldn't work. And trash, trash, trash in every closet and cupboard imaginable. Imagine renting a house and arriving with no running water! Lots of fun. I quickly called AirB&B, provided them with description and many photos, as requested. I would have left the house immediately, but since we arrived very late in the day, we had to stay one night - no water to shower or even to flush the toilet. We left early the the next morning. Like me, the guy who had written the bad review had also refused to stay.I never met the host, only an employee of his. The AirB&B handlers I talked to initially seemed friendly and understanding, but in discussions that lasted over a couple days, they changed their tune. The handler finally assigned to my case repeatedly tried to deny my claim for a refund, ignoring the evidence I supplied and taking whatever the host said at face value, and forcing me to refute his claims, which I did. The host misled AirB&B repeatedly. Finally, AirB&B denied my claim - not because they thought I was lying, I suppose, but because the host promised to send someone in to clean the place and presumably fix all the problems, literally an impossible task to perform in a short period of time (if ever). The host had zero credibility with me by this time - I would not have trusted him to keep his promise. Very clear that for financial reasons, AirB&B chose to side with the host against a paying customer to protect their own financial interest. Again, by this time, I was long gone, having moved temporarily into a hotel. I like to tell people, when you rent a house, the time to clean your property and get it in shape is BEFORE the guest arrives, not after the guest has arrived and starts complaining. Apparently, AirB&B would not agree with that notion. We are not talking about just a few isolated problems here.So even though I lost my entire month's rent, I was not about to ruin my vacation living in some dirty hell-hole of a house. The behaviour of the host cannot be excused, but it is the behaviour of AirB&B customer service that will prevent me from using AirB&B again. Ever."
"We will not use Airbnb again. We are currently enduring our 4th bad experience with their properties. Its a great marketing tool but THEY CANNOT DELIVER QUALITY. They really don't have the resources to insure that you have a good stay and as long as they are booking thousands of rooms, they don't care. We have not had these bad experiences with VRBO."
"Worst customer service ever! I tried to update a reservation several times on the app and followed all the instructions and was never messaged back. I called several times and was placed on hold for several minutes. One time I was on hold for 54 minutes before hanging up to call back. When I would chat with customer service as soon as I asked for a refund for my service fee, my chat was closed. I had to call the third party vacation rentalcompany to update my reservation with no help from Airbnb"
"I just had a nightmare of an experience with AirBnb and their host. The house we rented was filthy! After reading the reviews of those who posted one immediately after our stay,I'd say that there's definitely something fishy going on! They all said how perfectly clean it was. One even said there was No dust under the beds. Lol, that's because it was all over the baseboards! The host even sent a message stating that they were giving us a five star review- after we complained about the condition of the house and on the day before we'd left. Definitely fishy, don't you think?"
