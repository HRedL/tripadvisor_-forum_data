"Hello,'Just wanted to share news that I got word from my manager (I work in a local hospital) I will not be allowed to return to work for 14 days upon my return if I decide to keep my plans. This is all due to the Level 3 status. It is looking like my dream 50th birthday trip to Italy is not going to happen unless the CDC miraculously drops the warning back to a Level 2. I have two weeks to wait and see. I did reach out to our hotel in Florence and they said they will not refund our money but will let us apply it to a future stay. That at least is helpful.Thanks for all your support!"
"Well there's nothing you can do about that. Did your manager also say you would be quarantined if you went to Seattle instead?Sorry about this. Happy Birthday!Edited: 7:17 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Wow — I am so sorry and bummed for you and the fact that this was a birthday celebration is even more heartbreaking. I will cross my fingers that Italy virus stats start to flatline in the next 2 weeks so that maybe they will lower to category 2. This is the textbook case of life being unfair. Best of luck.
"Since they are instructing you to stay away from work, are they paying you to be off work for two weeks?Will this time they have decided you can miss effect your retirement credits, sick leave accrual and vacation accrual, etc.?If you are not in a union, maybe ask the Fair Labor Standards Board about your rights.At a minimum, they should let you take sick leave that you have earned which will get you paid time off.The hysteria does not allow your rights to fair employment to be suspended.I don't know your work at your hospital, but are they considering you disabled or eligible for light duties from your home?It is time to ask questions."
"Very sorry to hear the very bad news, electricgirl. Because (many) other US employers may follow suit, this is going to KILL US tourism and travel to Italy for the near future, and cause a huge falloff in summer reservations. US airlines will cut service, even to Rome, and may postpone new routes, such as EWR-PMO scheduled for this May with United Airlines. Most travelers will be adversely affected, if this mandatory quarantine become the norm. Only retired persons and those routinely working from home would be spared (apart from a 14-day quarantine at home), and even they might be affected for miscellaneous personal reasons. I don't think we have ever seen this situation since the end of WWII.The ECONOMIC fallout is going to be much, much worse than the number of persons infected. Italy, Japan, China and South Korea are all MAJOR world economic players. World airlines are going to experience an economic depression, and there will be very significant layoffs. Some carriers will go bust. And let's not even talk about the cruise ship operators."
"Hey, GAC:Not so fast.See my post above I think we may have been writing at the same time."
"Hi,If I have to self quarantine at home I will need to use my own earned/banked time. Then I have to be screened by Employee Health before being allowed to return to work. I am sure many other people nationwide are hearing the same news since CDC announcement on Friday."
"I am sorry for the loss of your birthday fun but I congratulate your employer for taking such a strong protective stance on behalf of the vulnerable people that your job puts you and your work colleagues in contact with.Governments need to act to provide support to the travel industry. Public health, however, must be the priority in this global emergency."
I think this will be the norm at least for the next couple of months.
"Hello Electric:So, you are not self-quarantining if your employer is issuing the direction.Be sure to do your due diligence on what it is they are going to own as having required.I live and work in the USA and these are red-hot topics that are testing the labor laws and your right to a work place without discrimination.I implore those reading this (who are not retired) to consult with a legal authority you trust about your rights to work in and around any medical condition.Employee Health is in a tricky/risky situation until more is learned about what it is they are looking for.The employee unions are on top of this for good reasons and responsible and ethical employers are also being careful to follow the law and not create a situation where the fiscal liabilities leveled against them for unfair labor practices will eclipse the medical ones.That said, please make sure what they instruct you to code is right. Get everything they instruct you to do in writing.My company is not putting anything in writing because legally they can not. Their is not backing as this is uncharted territory.Enjoy your travels and protect your employment rights."
"Well my company sent a mass email today to approximately 40,000 emp!oyees located all over the country. We were told without exception, that if we chose to fly to the regions of Italy, South Korea, Etc.,upon return we would be mandated to self-quarantine using our benefit time. This would only be if working from home was not an option. They stated that they must look out for the welfare of all employees. They also discussed the current areas in the US. Employers need to mitigate risk on both sides."
"My fingers are crossed for you--and for everyone, in the US, Italy, China, and worldwide--that the worst of this virus is over soon. Happy Birthday."
And so it begins....right now most travel to/from Italy but if other countries have a massive outbreak more countries will follow...
"The thing that bothers me about this is if a coworker has someone in their household that has the flu they are not made to self quarantine even though the flu is extremely contagious. Or if their child has a stomach virus, they will still come to work, also very contagious. In both of these examples there is direct contact with someone carrying a virus whereas you may not have any direct contact with someone carrying coronavirus just by travelling."
My company just announced no travel to Italy but Seattle is ok??? Go figure
"My heart goes out to you electric, vacations especially special ones, are something many people look forward to well in advance. I have a trip planned in late May (fingers crossed) and the idea of cancelling is sad beyond belief. I hope once the virus starts plateauing in Italy; the Italian government will work with the US to lift the restrictions; as I have a feeling allowing flight in and out of Europe would be low on the US priority list. Fingers crossed for you!Edited: 6:20 pm, March 03, 2020 "
William from florida here. My trip os planned for may. Of american airlines are still flying I will not cancell. I work in a retirement community with 3 hospitals. I do beleive my company will enact the same policy. I will not let that stop me from my dream vacation. I will enjoy the 14 day furlough. Live life darling.
"I am in the same situation as a nurse in Ohio. Fortunately, I have time to spare as my trip is not until the end of August. I was informed, we would have to use our PTO or file for FMLA. I hope things work out for you."
"I am sorry to hear you are most likely going to miss out on your trip to Italy. I too made plans to be in Italy for my 50th birthday, Rome specificaly. We flew out on the morning they moved to level 3 threat and it was too late to make any changes but I'm glad we didnt. Now that we are here it looks like the greatest risk seems to be in the northern areas. I know things are fluid and could change at any moment but currently Rome seems to be operating as usual even though there are probably far less tourists than normal. Would your job reconsider letting you go if you shifted your Italy trip south? The last report I read had 0 current positive cases in Rome. Currently in the area where I live there are more positive cases than in Rome. And those originated from people who had traveled to Asia or had contact with people who had traveled to Asia.So i figured i was at as much risk staying in Seattle as in Rome. As you are on the East coast that line of thinking proably doesnt make sense. But whatever you end up doing I wish you a very happy birthday."
"Hi All,Here is my update from today. I called Lufthansa and they told me I am not eligible for a refund or a rebooking because there is no interruption of service at this time and our booking is in economy. We are flying Boston-Rome with a layover in Frankfurt and home from Florence with a layover in Munich. They would consider letting us drop the Italy portion of our trip. They hard part is that I don't really have a desire to go to Germany. Some of my friends are encouraging us to travel and just take the penalty of 2 extra weeks off. I work in a hospital and the entire hospital system is following the 14 day rule. The other pain to all of this is that we can cut our losses and re plan Italy for September when my parents are available again to stay with our daughters. The problem is that we chose March because the rates were more reasonable and the temperature was not hot. I looked at our hotel in Rome and it will cost an extra $100 a night in September. All I can do at this point is pray that the US Government reduces the travel restrictions. Until then my suitcase remains in the attic."
"My husband (in healthcare) got the same notice Monday and we are supposed to be in Rome 3/15-18 before heading to Munich. His also included that time off would be unpaid, without job protection, and PTO would not be advanced. I assume that means you only get paid for time you have left in the year (not a worry for him as he has plenty). The job protection piece gives me major pause. I work in education and no such notice yet but I wouldn’t be surprised! I hate you are also experiencing this disappointment!!"
I feel like I was in limbo this past week regarding my trip. We had booked non refundable connecting flights using Chase points. I called Chase last Friday and was told if we canceled we would lose our points. Yesterday I received an email from Brussels Airlines stating they changed our outbound flight leaving Rome. The new flight is 4 hours later than what we originally booked and we would miss our connection. I called Chase again and was able to cancel and they refunded all of my points. If the level does not drop back to 2 maybe one of your airlines will change the flight time so you can get refunded.
"Yes, this is a real bummer For you. I wouldn't give up on Lufthansa allowing a change of dates for your flights. Every day the picture changes. Governments, businesses and other organizations will have to adapt their policies to changing circumstances. Perhaps LH's policy will change if you keep trying...or another agent will be more ""flexible."" Best of luck, please report back here, and Happy Birthday."
"I am sorry for your dilemma as well ... and SO SORRY for the Italian economy (not to mention ours and all other countries)! We were in the process of planning trip end of Sept before all this virus scare ... we have lodging booked, but had not bought airline tickets yet ... wondering if flights will be harder to get as reduced flights AND pent up demand kicks in ..."
"We have the same problem. My boyfriend's company is requiring 14 day minimum mandatory self quarantine, and his position does not allow for telework, so we must cancel our trip next week. My problem is with Lufthansa (our guest house was kind enough to let us out without penalty-- I will make certain to rebook with them -- Gigli D'oro Suites!). Those at Lufthansa informed me that I must wait until next week, and perhaps their policy of reimbursement will change. I informed them that we are willing to rebook for a later date-- end of May- yet they refuse to budge. They stated that I could reschedule the trip at a cost of $300 per ticket. Has anyone on this forum had any such issues and if so, how are you handling it? I do have documentation from the company. I would appreciate any guidance from those who are in the same situation and are addressing it with the airlines (speculation or advice from others who do not have concrete recent experience and evidence isn't necessary, thank you! ). And if desired by others, I will be happy to share that which I learn directly from the company with you as well."
"Please read my previous post.Contact your Fair Labor Standards Board.You have rights, policies, procedures and laws vs anarchy on the part of employers who have always put the rights of the worker first.While every company is different, some things are basic. Just because they are loosing their minds does not mean you loose yours.Also, be very careful about sending your company policies to others. That may get you fired and all of this will be moot."
We have been warned at my hospital of the quarantine possibility for any international travel. We are going in August so fingers crossed it’s gone by then. We are being allowed to use sick or vacation time. Do you have that option??
"My sister also works in a hospital and her manager told her the same thing...if you go, you will have to self-quarantine for 14 days to protect co-workers and patients. It will be unpaid as she is using all of her PTO to take this trip. We are scheduled to fly to Rome on 4/22/2020 and travel to Naples, Venice, Florence and Tuscany. Her dream trip! All of our trains are booked, accommodations and tours. We have travel insurance but don't think it covers the trains. Airbnb will refund except service fees, tours can be refunded. We would really love to still travel. Italy can't afford the tremendous loss of tourism, but we can't afford to self-quarantine. Really hoping the travel ban level will be reduced and we can visit Italia as planned. ❤"
"In response to #13 MisbakeThe reason you are not quarantined from a stomach virus is because that usually lasts 24/48 hours- and the flu has a vaccine you can get as well as meds to treat (tami-flu, ect.). This virus Corona #19 has no vaccine no cure no meds they still are unsure where it came from how its transmitted, ect. So to compare the two is a moot point- yes its sad for tourism yes its sad for people unable to go on their dream trips/vacations/birthday celebrations, yes its sad for the Cruise Industry- but this is a GLOBAL problem and it needs GLOBAL cooperation . It is a serious health issue affecting many Countries , and we need to start thinking as a collective and not I. Goverments and employers are putting these procedures in place ie: quarantines, travel bans, ect. for the GOOD of its people, not to deliberately hurt them. Here is the latest link from the VDC for US citizens :https:/…index.htmlEdited: 5:39 am, March 05, 2020 "
Very helpful thread. Thanks for posting. Can’t imagine being able to afford two weeks in additional time off when we have so little paid days off already in the US.
This was just announced todayhttps:/…index.html
"This cdc mandated ""self quarantine"" is sort of a joke....reports from travelers returning to JFK who had traveled to the ""hot zones"" report not being asked any questions and just walk back into the US with no more formalities than usual. How can our government not ask any questions...??? Of course these people are coming via other European cities at this point but still questions need to be asked. There are so many cases in US now being reported with some real common themes....trip to Italy (not just north), nursing home or cruise ship. And no questions at JFK??? So disappointed. People need to at least be made aware of who to contact if symptoms develop."
"So, gene, you think everyone who is questioned is going to tell the truth? Please stop the unhelpful rants based upon anecdotal data."
@32 I ignore posts that I don't find helpful...yes asking questions should be done ..do I think everyone tells the truth of course not...but at least they could try. Just ignore me as I do you.
