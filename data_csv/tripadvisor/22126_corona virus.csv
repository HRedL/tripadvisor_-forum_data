booked holiday for june is corona virus affecting cala bona yet
"Hi - Can you define what you mean by affecting?At the moment there have been a total of 8 confirmed cases in Mallorca, and none of those have been in Cala Bona."
Its anyones guess the extent to which the virus will affect anywhere in the world by June - there is simply no way of knowing.
"Agree - just no way of knowing that far ahead. The situation is changing by the minute. Let's hope for the best.Edited: 10:14 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"hi were at the hotel levente 31,march were reading all sorts some are saying all hotels will close untill june post if you ere enything"
“ were reading all sorts some are saying all hotels will close untill june“Where are you reading or hearing that ALL hotels will close until June?
Trump has just announced a travel ban from Europe to the US for 30 days starting on Friday. Strangely doesn't include Ireland and the UK. So people could just travel to London and continue from there? Americans will apparently be allowed to return if they have passed appropriate screening. I have no idea what that means or how it would be put into practice.
Well isn’t that just great LL. Another corker from Trump. So we get everybody from Europe with their germs coming here so they can travel on to the US.
"He called it a ""foreign"" virus. Sheesh."
"hi i was reading info saying hotels closing till june, aswell,i am due too fly too majorca 4th april, staying in cala bona protur bonaire aparthotel,"
The Bonaire opened last week.The Mallorca bulletin report is scaremongering and is upsetting a lot of business owners who are going to find it hard enough this season without this type of ‘journalism’.
"thank you for your reply john, i appreciate it, that is good too know, kind regards x"
I am due to fly to Majorca on the 3rd of April.lets hope there won't be a travel ban x
If it is a package your tour operator with help resolve things. and if not and there is a ban your travel insurance should kick in. There is nothing to do but wait and see !
"News reports I heard suggest that holiday insurers will NOT step in, the whole thing is spiralling downwards the whole time ...."
"I agree. It's worth asking your travel provider (package or whatever) or travel insurance company if they are going to step in. However, they don't have to. A ""disinclination to travel"" is what they call cancelling before your government advise against non-essential travel. Makes it sound like you just don't fancy going - kind've ignores all the agonising that people go through when cancelling an expensive holiday. Whatever holidaymakers are going through is of course nothing compared to what people are suffering in parts of Italy and elsewhere."

"hi there, i have booked cala bona for 4th april this year, i honestly think it will still go ahead, earlier everyone was saying the schools in uk would be shutting but they are not, i hope you get your holiday. X"
"hi were booked at the hotel levante 31 march and 12,may at the alisa i hope all is well its been along wait no one is telling us enything"
I’m staying in the Protur Bonaire Aparthotel next week. I spoke to TUI who confirmed that they are currently open as normal and are not due to close. Only hotels with occupancy rates below 30% are closing and the guests scheduled to stay at affected resorts are going to be moved to another hotel
I'm going to Cala Millor next week (19/03/2020) but will be visiting Cala Bona. I'm from the UK and hoping the virus hasn't hit either places? Have there been reports of anyone with the virus there and what are the Spanish government doing about it?
"I’m in Palma at the moment. Apart from empty shelves in some supermarkets, hand sanitiser In various places and one person wearing a mask I’ve seen no signs of anything different from my previous visits. In fact, the city is buzzing."
They saying hotels with under 30 per cent occupancy will close and move tourists to other hotels... we going that day too.....we hope@
"hi were flying to majorca on the 6th april the unknown is driving me crazy i dont want to even talk about the holiday to my 2 kids we should be getting all excited to be going but i dont want to build them up to then knock them down..as we know a lot can happen in 3 weeks so who knows if we are going or not ☹Edited: 9:15 am, March 13, 2020 "
#22 “ They saying...”. Who is saying that please? Your hotel? Travel agent? Next door neighbour’s sister?
https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/lo… Hope everyone stays well and safe.
Just back from cala bona today!! Albeit a reluctant tourist!! Business as usual appeared to be the order of the day!! No issues. Thalassa cafe buzzing as was rope and anchor and cats whiskers. We were blessed with some amazing weather too!! The levante was amazing!! All geared up with hand sanitisers everywhere and clean as a whistle!! Aww i am wishing myself back there as we speak!!
"Hi have you heard from Protur, i am due to fly to protur alicia on 3rd April, I have messaged them with no response. app only hotels with less that 30% occupancy are staying closed"
"hi i have heard back from protur bonaire, cala bona and they said business as usual."
"We are at Santa Ponsa 1st week of April, I'm hoping this will all blow over, but at the same time don't want to endanger my family., there's nothing we can do but wait and see what happens, after all been healthy is far better than catching the virus."
"We're due to fly out on 3rd April and staying in the Gran Sol, think Spain will be closed before then. Just following the confirmed new cases over the last few days, 2100 in Spain since midnight last night. I've found a websi"
"Should be flying out 3rd April but I suspect Spain is going the same way as Italy. Found a website that shows data on the virus. Spain has recorded 2100 new cases since midnight last night, it awas showing only 76 at 10.00 this morning"
"hi there , also due too fly out 4th april, too cala bona protur bonaire heard from hotel this morning, its business as usual, as day has gone on it seems more has changed, im not sure what will happen X"
"Jet2 are turning around flights to Spain today. If travelling with jet2 please see their website for up to date info. Sorry to inform, unlikely anyone will be travelling now."
"Jet2 and Tui cancelled flights to Spain, the resort could be very quiet for the start of the season, very sad, we love the place and have been looking forward to our holiday"
"oh no so gutted , with tui , too xxxx"
So sad for anybody due to go now. The Thalassa is there in the sun. People sitting there. It is so sad and confusing for people. We came home yesterday and feel so thankful. I'm sure when flights are running there will be some bargains so hopefully people who have had their holiday cancelled will be able to book again.
"As per TUI websiteHolidays to Spain, Canary Islands, Balearics IslandsFollowing local measures put in place by the Spanish Authorities, including closing some hotel facilities and the local bars, restaurants and beaches we have made the difficult decision to cancel holidays due to travel between 14th and 29th March."
"TUI Tui would like to thank our customers for their understanding.Holidays to Spain, Canary Islands, Balearics IslandsFollowing local measures put in place by the Spanish Authorities, including closing some hotel facilities and the local bars, restaurants and beaches we have made the difficult decision to cancel holidays due to travel between 14th and 29th March.

Customers due to travel after 29th March, please bear with us as we prioritise customers due to travel in the next two weeks. We would like to thank our customers for their understanding"
"Me too but I’m travelling on the 6th, what do you think will happen hun."
"Call me a pessimist but I doubt you will be going anywhere Michele . You cannot do anything other than wait and see This epidemic is not going to resolve itself any time soon. Spain has another 1400 new cases reported overnight (and 96 new fatalities ) bringing the Spanish total to date to approx. 7,800 and over 290 deaths (see https:/…countries ) - they will not be in any hurry to welcome foreign holidaymakers any time soon I am afraid"
Latest figures for all countries are shown on this site: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/They do not make for happy reading. Although I live in Spain my heart goes out to the people of Italy who are suffering so much. The increase of 3500 case in just one day across their country puts this into perspective. A few weeks ago I thought this would not be this serious. Now I know how wrong I was.
Get your money back its on total lockdown here only 1 person allowed to go out for provisions
Really Angela is that at Cala bona. I’m due to go to protour Bonaire 6th April for 10 nights.
"The lockdown is nationwide. Absolutely everywhere across Spain and the islands. Breaking the restrictions carries a max fine of 600,000€. The police and civil guard are out patrolling the streets. It isn’t fun and isn’t going to change anytime soon."
"I’m not sure people are grasping the gravity of what’s going on, things are not going to miraculously return to normal in three weeks so I’m sorry, but there’s little to no chance of anyone going anywhere, let alone on holiday for several months."
I usually love looking at he Simply Majorca webcam. Now finding it really upsetting. All seems so unreal. I am wondering who it is who drives up to the left hand side of the harbour around 9 each morning and goes to a bar? Walks backwards and forwards from the vehicle.
"You are so right trinet. Many people are going to have to self-isolate for three months from this weekend, never mind three weeks!"
"BPT. Many people in the UK are going to get a wake up call when the Govt decide to take action like other European countries and reality strikes. Forget about travel , even locally, and no one knows when the peak of virus will be reached and then we can pick up the pieces trying to get back to normality. No wonder , even posts as recent a few days ago , show that many didn’t realise how serious it was going to be asking about travel here in a week or so. This is our 3rd day of lockdown and honestly people who don’t need to or can’t work are staying off the streets. IMO Sunday a ghost town , Monday more movement but perhaps more workers told to go home. Today very much like Sunday. Authorities and supermarkets immediately gave out advice how to minimise risk to staff and yourself to keep safe."
"Yep, it’s pretty grim Don. I think our garden will get lots of attention this summer."
Cala at eastern cape its got coronavirus??

I think that Post 52 is a troll !
Samantha G have you seen the latest from tui holidays. I don’t no how to add a thread but tui are saying they are cancelling all flights till the 16th April 2020
"Due to the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19, the Foreign Commonwealth Office have advised against all but essential travel. We will therefore no longer be offering TUI Airways flights and holidays departing between 17 March and 16 April 2020.We will proactively contact all customers due to travel up to and including 16 April 2020 to offer a range of flexible options, including moving their holiday to a later date.All customers overseas are being looked after by our resort and customer service teams, with customers in many of our destinations able to return home on their original scheduled return flight.Due to local restrictions, customers in Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritius and Spain will return home early and will be proactively contacted with details of their new airport transfer and flight times.The health and safety of our customers and crew remains of primary importance and we look forward to taking people on holiday again."
No one will be travelling anywhere for months.
looking at the current state of affairs bigron52 I believe you mat be right.
I have just looked on Cala Millor facebook page. It shows someone eating in Little stars in Cala Millor??? What is that all about? Or is someone's idea of 'fun' making out you can go out as places are open?
Quality spy1 Sick people indeed. So irresponsible to suggest it is ok to go out and about. Let#s hope the police track this person down! My thoughts are with the lovely inhabitants of Cala Bona and Cala Millor. To be shut inside under strict rules fills me with dread.
"Feel really sorry for all the businesses, it will be so hard for them with no tourism."
"Looked at the live webcam in the harbour yesterday, 1.15 in the afternoon, nobody in sight, not a single person. So sad"
"I wonder if this will have an effect on the anti tourist brigade in Palma etc , be care full what you wish for!!!"
Perhaps not the best thing to post at a time when people are desperately in need of kindness and understanding?
I agree - very tactless
"I just had a wee look at livecam which has multiple views of Mallorca and, as others have said, not a single soul in any of them. And SeeMajorca's PP view likewise, no-one to be seen. Tragic shame for the businesses, hotels, bars etc..."
"I hope its up and running soon, I need my daily fix although I can watch Tim Harris videos on YouTube. For anyone who loves Cala Bona like we do an have not followed his videos there worth checking out. Stay safe out there."
"Spain lockdown now extended to until April 12th. Only on our 9th day at the moment and sort of getting used to it as no option anyway. No food shortage , rationing or panic buying but will not venture out to shop until really have to- only once so far. Thank goodness we can look out onto roads and see the odd vehicle and dog walker pass. As many say the police are so strict as while we were doing the nightly applause at 8pm a person was walking along the street and the police grilled him for 10min then sent In his way. Police cars sit various times at junctions to check if you have a valid reason driving or walking also more so documents to prove you are having to work etc. I can only assume UK will lockdown soon and giving a heads up as what it’s like here. Only food places open so forget about any diy project as you can’t get supplies. Example a similar store here like Tesco ,which sells everything, the non food is taped off as only food can be purchased. Weather not even brilliant today. Stay safe and get used to not socialising for quite a while."
"It may we worth checking susan by giving them a call. It all depends when you were due to travel. Currently Jet2 intend to start package holidays from 17th June. I think personally being far too optimistic but hey ho. Be prepared to be waiting an awful long time though on the lines as due to these unprecedented times, they are absolutely mad busy dealing with cancellations and the likes. Let us know how you get on and good luck."
"We all try our best to be accurate but you need to check the information with Jet2 Holidays (the wording of you post suggests that it is a package with them not just flights)Here is a link to its website https:/…fee-free-amendmentsThey are currently offering charge free amendments to holidays departing before 17 June plus an allowance towards the cost of your new booking - it looks as though the rescheduling will include trips for next yearEdited: 3:33 am, April 16, 2020 "
"""plus an allowance towards the cost of your new booking"" ...which currently ( 16 April 2020 ) says may be removed,changed at any time...so triple check the TCs to see the wording...and of course the cost of your new dates may require additional funds ( no idea if refunds if your dates were priced lower )"
I am sure that nobody would expect to get more than the credit for the trip they are swapping Tom . I think that it is perfectly reasonable to expect trips later in the season or next year to be more costly than the early season booking that is a washout due to Covid19
"""I think that it is perfectly reasonable to expect trips later in the season or next year to be more costly than the early season booking that is a washout due to Covid19""You would think so but posters on some Majorca threads are on a different planet with their thinking so was just to remind people to keep feet on this planet ;-) etc. I think like for like prices will be higher 2021, but market demand will bring corrections. I also expect to read many more ""come on buy now prices ( regret it later? ) "" too I'm not in the financial category of ' I can take a punt at these prices'Edited: 6:06 am, April 16, 2020 "
hi i.ve just had ae.mail from the hotel alicia saying they will be closed all season we were going in sept 15.th does eny one know enything
"From what I've been reading from the Mallorca/Spanish press, it looks like this years tourism (in the Balearics) is going to open in stages. First to inter-island tourism only (Menorca, Ibiza, Mallorca) in mid-late Summer. Then maybe late Autumn for people living on mainland Spain to visit the islands. Then at the end of the year or early NEXT year for ""outsiders"". This is what I've heard but it is still being hashed out at the upper levels of government. Some politicians seem to believe that the Island businesses can survive on ONLY domestic tourism this year but most business owners don't agree with this,There has even been some pressure too from foreign property owners who can't get to their homes on Mallorca until these travel bans are lifted. But the President of the Balearics doesn't seem to care that much about the tourists or local businesses that rely on tourism, so these bans could easily carry on until well into next year. Then there is talk of some sort of medical check card (a bit like a pet passport) and screening at the airport(s)Guess we just have to sit tight until the world rights itself again...Edited: 12:34 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"@Ken B- interesting bc I was just reading they actually want to try to make it happen! I guess no one really knows yet, and Im sure different people have different interests/ opinions on what is best. The Majorca/ Spanish press probably is a better source vs their tourism leadershttps://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/12…"
"Hi Ken. Tbh I think that every minister from central government and those from our regional government are making it up as they go along. Like you I read the local daily papers, El Pais and look at the rtve live feed. One day they say one thing and the next something different. Until there is some easing of the lockdown for us peeps without children or a dog, I have no idea what will happen next! Cheers."
"KenB. Plenty typing but no real info but hearsay , what’s proposed etc etc. Anyone intending to travel Balearics / Spain should wait until the Spanish Government state the next stage of lockdown be it more /less restrictions and what travel is eventually permitted and then make your own decisions. Why cause stress again rearranging or booking flights until then. Very few , if any , Spanish people would post similar questions on a UK forum as they know first hand how serious the virus is. I have watched the Glasgow forum which up to the virus was very busy but now practically dried up but Mallorca plods on. IMO there is a false sense in Uk as shopping , exercise, no limits people in car , B&Q stores open , etc so practically couldn’t call it a lockdown. Can’t believe any time what I hear and see in the UK from friends and family. Don’t blame them thinking won’t happen to them or their family, just a hiccup and wanting to book holidays again soon. Personally can’t wait until the island returns to a bit of normality again. I also note that we all hope most of the local businesses in the resort survive. Saying that the first thing that would help ALL is stopping the AI which killed many traditional places in the resorts and return to choices of h/f board only. Until you manage to holiday again in Mallorca stay safe."
"#84 It is rather Spain which is the exception, with Italy. France to a lesser extent. Not only the UK, but all countries in the North of Europe opted for a much lighter lockdown. And most countries now organize starting the end of the lockdown in May. But even here in Northern Europe it is clear international tourism will not resume immediately.Edited: 2:31 pm, April 22, 2020 "
CalviaDon I do not think UK will be going on any holidays until at least 2021 or even 2022 unless there is a vaccine. In UK lock down if different for different groups of people. My husband and I have been told not to leave our home until end of June and may be longer. We are not to even shop unless we have no food. We are honestly expecting that we must stay in until a vaccine is found or some other miracle.
"Ken B #87 Agree that we all have to wait until each country state when safe to move about and travel. Chatted to g/son last night and he was saying some school classes in his area of France will soon be returning. Then message this morning he and his mum had been interviewed then watched them on French National tv at 1. Another thing I noticed people , in France , queuing up at vending machines for masks €4 each. I have tried our local chemist for a mask in the 3 occasions I have been shopping since lockdown. Ordered on Amazon 2 weeks ago and perhaps further 3 weeks before they arrive. Local Aldi’s got sanitiser on sale again. Stay safe."
"Such a worry when your family is far and wide Don. Masks- you can make your own to quite an effective level. Two or more layers of clean high density cloth (not a bandana) provide a protection level that is significantly better than nothing. Some people here say ""but it only protects other people"". And? If others wear them we are all more protected. As long as you don't ever touch the inside part before use and wash at 60° after every use, still keep 2m away and don't touch the front of your mask it has to be better than nothing. I use mine for grocery shopping because maddeningly some people are still not taking this seriously and get way too close."
"Hi Don,Yeah, they are even talking masks now in the UK. It's all changing. Someone really needs to formulate a plan soon because everyone's life is on hold at the moment. It would be nice to see some sort of global cooperation to allow international travel again. Our trips to Mallorca were about the only thing keeping us sane in our work. I have family in the US too so I am hoping I don't have to travel there whilst travel restrictions are in place.I know Spain has a really strict lockdown. It's bearable here in the UK and it's still a pain, so I do feel for you there.Good luck. And hope we get some ""normal"" back into the world order very soon..."
"I am just wondering who is expected to buy all these masks that UK citizens may be asked to use Ken B. Are are we going to get them free, at cost to the NHS prices or be prisoner to opportunist sellers on Ebay? It worried me that there are people already desperately short of money to feed their families - are THEY going to be forced to buy masks in order to be allowed outdoors - is so disorganised BTW Ken B - if you have family in the US are you aware of Mr Trump's latest medical idea? He has been spouting off with his usual flair suggesting that people be injected with disinfectant to kill of the infection from within !! Truly, I kid you not , it is not a late April Fools joke , he said it at a press conference and asked the medical experts present to look into it as he was sure it would work . It is all over the media with loys of footage! see https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/trump-sug… !Edited: 11:50 am, April 24, 2020 "
"Did our big shop alone today using the car. That will last us again for over a week as we don’t set foot over the door until then. Got for the first time a couple of masks today but again won’t use until next time out 98c each. Sad /weird as driving along front of PN , temp in 20’s , and not a soul to be seen on the sand. With more workers allowed to be out this week masks and gloves were being handed free , for immediate personal use , at various places including the intermodal. Council using disinfectant at entrance area and immediate car park of Aldi’s today. We see the larger tanker sprayed roads and pavements. They really are all out trying to keep us all safe so we do our part staying in as much as possible to help combat the virus."
I think the reality with masks and shear numbers required is some DIY designs. Believe is mostly about catching more of your own output rather than protection. With distancing there appears Good argument that they offer benefit in that respect?
@calviaDon. Have they said what the disinfection is for and does it get repeated?
"#95 No idea what disinfectant is used when using the pressure spray for example this morning around the entrance to Aldi but he was fully protected and you could smell it. I reckon done at least daily but i only go weekly. Roads and pavements are sprayed i am sure daily using a tanker with powerful jets spraying in front and to the sides as it drives along slowly. No idea what is in it as have seen it done even after been raining earlier. Unlike when they pressure wash the pavements every morning during the season. with water Also strange so many weeds growing along the pavements as very little foot traffic for six weeks. At times ,with what we see and do here , does Spain have a different virus or just ott. Perhaps we will know in time if the efforts here have been beneficial reducing local spread of the virus and sooner gradual easing off of our total lockdown."
"Nothing mentioned about masks in todays briefing. Hope we dont go down that route.Did see something in the British press today, further to what I mentioned about staggered easing of travel bans, that the tourist minister for the Balearics has been quoted as saying that the islands won't be open to UK tourism this year at all as (he says) Britain was late implementing lockdown.Personally I think that's rubbish as our lockdown wasn't that far behind Spain so why should we miss out months of potential visits.Don't think ANYTHING has been decided but I really don't like what I'm hearing from the Balearic officialdom. Wait and see I guess.Until then take care all."
"Hi Ken. Can appreciate your point of view. But, as a permanent resident of the islands I’m thinking that having lived with the most draconian lockdown in Europe, we wouldn't like it to have been in vain. Think about it like this.... Menorca resident population just 95,000 approx. One flight with just one infected person might screw it completely. I know holidays are so important, but the islands will be here and happy again soon, just not right now. Cheers, Ruth."
Hi Ken with many friends on Menorca as QS has said enduring very very difficult time things need to happen right re risk minmisation
"@CalviaDon. Thanks for that. Strange. Bit confused if Virus related as it cannot live on surfaces too long and what are chances of very restricted folks that move about in those areas ""re contamininating""I can see some reason around entrance areas to stores,particular buildings etcEdited: 2:19 am, April 25, 2020 "
Media is media but with photo stories of Brits gathering when the sun comes out who would not be questioning us being responsible tourists?
"Ruth I do understand and I too would not like to see a resurgence of the disease and subsequent restrictions. But I don't understand the minister singling out UK visitors. I would agree to a full health screening if it meant we could return sooner to the island.I worry that, as Brits account for 25-30% of the tourism (and in some businesses probably 90% of their income) the island economy is going to suffer too much. Tourism is the largest source of revenue in the Ballearics and most of that is INTERNATIONAL visitors. I would not like to finally get to return to Cala Bona and see every other business boarded up. I see enough of that on our high streets here in the UK.Take care Ruth and everyone. Keep safe."
"Hi Ken, I really feel for you. You were wise with money so saved enough so you could afford a little holiday home. You are not at all uncaring in being pretty upset that you can not visit. This is your life. In my opinion I think you will be able to get there July/August. There is a lot going on with regards the economy in Spain as is ours. They know they need tourists or they are dead in the water."
Yippee ! Put the cava on ice and stock up with sunscreen Ruth
"Congratulations to all the residents of the Balearics. Get out, enjoy the freedom.K."
That is such good news. It will make all the difference.
Yes we can only hope that if figures don’t rise this coming week we can all go out for some exercise from May 2nd. Poor dogs will get a rest as never seen the same dogs walked so much each day. My shirts and shorts have also shrunk in the last several weeks. Stay safe and hope not too long for holidays to return.
"Nice to see signs of life on the web cam, not a lot but it helps raise ones spirit"
"Every day, even if I don't feel like it - I go for my daily walk. I think of it as a privilege, knowing that friends and family elsewhere are not so lucky. Hopefully people won't go too mad; you could understand it a wee bit after being locked up for so long."
Me too. I don't know what we would have done if we had not been able to go out! It has really upset me knowing people in Spain could not go outside.
Likes...I just noticed your name!
"Its so good to hear that the rules have been relaxed slightly but people are still being sensible. We seem to have a problem with that in the UK at the moment, so many people thinking they are invincible. So looking forward to our first trip back to the island, stay safe everyone.Donna"
