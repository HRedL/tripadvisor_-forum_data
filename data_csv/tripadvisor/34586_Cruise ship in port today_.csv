Anyone aware of what’s going on with a ship in port? Looks like a Holland America ship. Just curious.
"Just re-fueling re-stocking with crew aboard but no tourists. They are supposed to be here four or five days,"
"OK, I have to ask, MarJ. Since I lost a Mexican cruise last year (10-days on Princess) and just lost another one to Alaska with COVID-19 ---- and being familar with the port and the ships that dock there (can't help myself....I was a cruiser in my younger years before the ships over 1500 passengers) --- if that is the case, did wherever you got your information on re-fueling mention why they are refueling and doing maintenance in PV? (Re-fueling doesn't take 4 or 5 days all by itself)I ask because most ships re-fuel in the their home ports or on an actual itinerary and PV is not the home port of any Holland America cruise ship.I'm curious as to whether the Port of Puerto Vallarta is the only place with berth room and authorization for a cruise ship to port for all that maintenance? Home ports are massive, but not big enough to contain all the ships not sailing now.Generally, it's just the Rotterdam and the Oosterdam that ever port in Puerto Vallarta, based on years of observation. Curious which one this is? There are many more ships on that line. It's an odd request but I got addicted to cruising in the good old days (80's to 90's) so would love to know. Others in PV who observe that ship might be curious also. Thanks."
"I read an article about it this morning. Of course, can't find it now. According to the marina web page it is Koningsdam (Netherlands) and is on it's way to Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Most ships that have sailed through, post-pandemic, have been docking for a few days and then moving on. I can't see this one, so it must be moored at the marina. If they are anchored in the bay, I can usually see them. Not too helpful, but that's all I got. LOL."

Carnival still has over 3000 crew members floating around the world with no place to go. Ships can not just park where they usually do to pick up people...the ports are full...so they move them around. Maybe this ship moved somewhere to let some members off in pangas to just move over to another ship. This is happening lots now.Some countries are not letting their own citizens enter...case in point India. Many workers on the ships are from india..and they just keep sailing around...got to india and were refused...2 times that I remember. The death by suicide rate is growing on the various ships as the workers just can not take it any longer...so very sad.
"Absolutely Judy. I only did 8 cruises total in my younger years but remember well how our wonderful crew members on every ship would look forward to the end of that assignment and then take a long trip home to rest up with their families for an extended period prior to starting their next several-month stint. They are cooped up very uncomfortably on those ships. Some, during the trip, would have port-leave in exotic locations. They work around the clock while on the ship. None of that routine or those breaks these days.Crew members do seem to enjoy interacting with friendly passengers (like we were) who engage them, listen to their stories and give them appreciative tips and attention. Some of my favorite cruising-pictures were with crew members, even the ones behind the scenes.I can't even imagine how grim it is when they are stuck out to sea with no happy, appreciative passengers to assist and entertain.That's why I asked. No home port has room for all their ships, so I was wondering if the news source MarJ heard from had additional information. Plus, I got addicted to cruising in the mid-80's on multiple Mexican Riviera cruises. Great for young kids too.Thanks so much for the extra information, Judy. From my reading over the months, I suspected it was a highly stressful and negative experience for those crews these days, virtually being ""homeless"" and "" no terra firma.Edited: 4:08 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Wow interesting topic. never thought about the workers not getting home.
"Here is an interesting chart...many many pages...From the CDC showing how many cruise workers were let off at various ports. So many on various ships are still just pleading to get off. Keep in mind people like the spa, beauty shops, photographers, entertainers, etc...plus the ship workers...makes a lot of people.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/tr…Another website I read often is this one. This is a TRUSTED lawfirm (yes there are some!!)...And the workers feel safe in sending photos, articles, death notices, etc. to this lawyer...so that he can publish and also tries to help the cruise ship workers. This is where you see the cruise worker deaths, and inside information.https://www.cruiselawnews.com/Working executive groups on ships for 10 years I got to know so many of the crew on various ships...and always enjoyed our times together talking about life and families, etc. Too many of these workers are away from home for the first time and have a hard time dealing with life...lonesome, no friends, on a ship where many can never get off as the country they are from IS NOT allowed in any of the ports. People never know that places like Mexico have a ban on many countries...who are not allowed to ever leave the ship. All we ever hear about are Mexicans not being allowed into countries...but it goes both ways. So many good but some sad memories of such a fun experience. Getting paid to sail was fun...but enjoy having both feet on land now...but thinking of a cruise now to a few places still on my bucket list. Too old to get to those any other way BUT a ship...so hope to still be able to see in a year or three so that I can attempt a cruise. Right now there is NO thought of getting on a ship...way too close quarters with the virus...and those vents that probably still have not...nor will ever be set up so they can filter out things from the next rooms! Smelling perfume from 5 rooms away through the venting system is NOT a safe thing now...the virus spreads that way too!"
"Ever since I saw the 1st Poseidon Adventure I'll, never take a cruise..."
"The cruise ships pulling into port in PV are not doing maintenance, they are refueling and re-stocking supplies. Crew has to remain onboard the ship. Some of the earlier ships have pulled into port to allow their crew to go directly to the airport for flights home, something other countries were not allowing them to do. This ship is only in for re-fueling and re-stocking supplies."
