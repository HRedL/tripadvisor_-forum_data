"Arrived at 2pm after making a quick stop at White House Subs for a good ole turkey sub. Able to drop luggage off with the bell desk before self-parking. Upon entering, you are directed to go through a check-in point where you are asked a few questions (I.e. - are you or have you experienced Covid symptoms in the last 14 days, been in contact with infected persons, been infected in the last 14 days, etc.). If you answer no to all questions, you are allowed in. No temperature check upon walking in. Three people on line at check in. Plexiglass has been placed at the front desk. No temperature check here either. Was given a bag with two masks, hand sanitizer and wipes. Got a room right away (Bayview tower with an awesome view). As I was approaching my room, the cleaning staff was just exiting so no sticker on my door but they assured me they cleaned it. Stickers on all the doors I had passed. Immediately disinfected the room just in case and settled in. The hotel is empty but all smoking rooms are already sold out. Was able to get a reservation at Gordon Ramsey Steak tonight (outdoor dining). About to head down and check out the casino floor but bell hop already confirmed it’s dead right now. But, so far, everyone we’ve encountered has been very welcoming and seemed happy to be back.Supposed to be here a few nights so if you have questions, I’ll do my best to give answers."
Thanks for the update. Where exactly is Gordon Ramsey's outdoor dining?
"I’d love to know what the table minimums are like over there for craps, blackjack and roulette if you get a chance to look. Thanks!"
"I can’t wait to hear how the outdoor dining at the pool with Gordon Ramsay’s menu is!!! If you head over to Ocean on the boardwalk I have an oddly specific question- are the bar top games on at William Hill? They have a few 10/6 DDB I like to think of as my personal ATM- I’ll be there the 9-12th, hoping they are on!"
"Sukie1220 - First & foremost, be safe. I wish you 'wellness' & good luck with anything you play.Regarding the questions at check-in: This is really nothing more than a gesture on the part of the casino to add to the image of ""being prepared"". After making the journey to get there, who, realistically, would admit to having been in contact with someone infected. And with what we know about asymptomatic spreaders (and the fact that a person can be infected & not know it) who can truly be sure. The other questions are irrelevant from a security standpoint. Nothing more than 'window dressing' - kinda like some aspects of TSA checks.Edited: 5:12 pm, July 03, 2020 "
I hope they did a better room cleaning than a few midtown Manhattan hotels did a few days ago. https:/…Good Luck & Stay Well
turn on room air conditioning!
"more younger people getting virus now,hope they have health insurance."
"But beware of air conditioning that only recirculates and does not supply clean outside air!https:/…Hard Rock seems to understand this and says they will increase ""the quality of air circulation and maximizing the exchange of fresh air with 100% outside air flow into the building."" —at least in common areas?https:/…safe-sound"
"Thanks everyone for the well wishes. We (husband and I) are being very careful. Not touching our masks, sanitizing our hands after touching any machines or chips. So far the slots have been tight. Lost $400 in 2 hours. Tables are lacking for the amount of people that have appeared since I first arrived. It looks like a regular night in the casino now. The room was cleaner than I’ve ever seen. When I went over everything again with my own wipes there was no dirt.Kwokpot - I believe they have a tent up on the outdoor patio (upstairs from the pool). But I’ll confirm after dinner.IIDxias - There were 3 6-deck blackjack tables (2 for $25, 1 for $10). I’ll double check the other games when I go back down.With regards to drinking in the casino, we’ve seen a few people with bottles of water, Pepsi, Sprite and no one is making them get rid of it. Also, they have set up a little pop up wine and beer for purchase bar right by the elevators. 4 beers in a bucket for $12, wine bottles for $25....and they include glasses and corkscrew.It’s definitely starting to fill up and I can see it being busier tomorrow.Edited: 6:48 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Is only outdoor dining allowed? IS anybody on the beach?
Yes and yes.
"Is it 3 to a table at BJ, LIR and 3card ? Also 6 per craps table ?"
Thanks for the report and for answering questions......are there coffee pots in the room?
Thanks for sharing. Hope you will be able to find time to make updates now and then. Info from AC is sparce.Thanks again. Be Safe . Have Fun and good luck.
"So things are starting to turn, maybe for the worst....To answer some questions, I haven’t been to the beach but it is open and outdoor dining is allowed but options are very limited.Yes re: number of players at the table but I have not seen much enforcement of the no congregating around tables. No coffee pots in the room, but they did leave the refrigerators in. FYI - if you’re a smoker, rooms are HARD to come by. Spoke to several people last night that were trying to switch to smoking rooms today. Guess people are sick of the tiny designated smoking area RIGHT next to the doggie relief area.So, as I said at the beginning, things are starting to turn. The ONLY thing Harrah’s got right so far was Gordon Ramsay Steak Under the Stars. What a wonderful set up it was on the outdoor (upstairs) deck. Lots of spacious tables (if I had to guess, 30 or so), each under a large umbrella or tent. The grilling was being done right on the deck on an outdoor grill. And, of course, one of the few bars where you could get a cocktail, however, they were unable to make any of their specialty cocktails because no ingredients (that made no sense). The weather at 9pm last night was perfect for dining out but if it rains at least half the tables would be unusable. Back to the casino after dinner and the line at check-in looked like a typical Friday night, long! A lot of families and people dressed as if they literally came from the beach. Played more conservatively for a couple hours before deciding the place was feeling too crowded and decided to stop at Tazza for a dessert for the room.....no go! Line for Tazza all the way down by the bell desk and only two people working. Then decided to stop by the gift shop for a sweet and THAT had a line (not as bad but still a wait). And that’s when we encountered our first “knuckleheads”. Three young men, clearly intoxicated, walking around yelling at each other with NO MASKS AND SMOKING! There was security everywhere yet NO ONE seemed to notice the 3 maskless drunks smoking away right in the middle of the lobby. Decided then and there that we’d be checking out Ocean tomorrow (today) to see if they are handling things better. So as of now Harrah’s seems very crowded with limited table games (a lot of closed tables), limited dining options (which I was prepared for but still disappointed more of the existing restaurants didn’t open), and the shenanigans have begun. Saw a lot more people on the casino floor with their own bottled beverages. Majority still wearing their masks but let’s see if that holds today.Our plan is to check out Ocean today. Will report back.Edited: 7:38 am, July 04, 2020 "
Just wanted to add that there was no rhyme or reason to how they “spaced out” the slot machines. They turned off all the Walking Dead machines and moved them to a corner but there are a million of the same damn Lightning Link machines everywhere. Ugh!
"Thanks for contiueing to share. Very Informative.Have Fun, Goood Luck, Stay Safe."
YES im glad smokers will not be giving doggies cancerous smoke.
"Thanks for your updates Stay safe and hopefully prosperous With the shortage of smoking rooms that you have pointed out, i could only imagine the probability of the smoking guests who could not get a smoking room, are smoking in their non smoking room......dispite the possible repercussionsEdited: 11:17 am, July 04, 2020 "
"yes i worked in medical field,x-ray,copd is a slowly suffocating of lungs caused by smoking."
"Sukie, was it a fairly full menu at Ramsey rooftop? Made reservations after your nice review! Look forward to your Ocean Resort report as staying there a few day. Thank you for all the insight!"
"ChristopherALL - it was a fairly full menu. The one thing notably missing was the street corn side dish which was disappointing but, honestly, no biggie. As for Ocean, our plans were thwarted by my hubby’s back pain flare up. Been hanging in the room and letting him rest so we can hit the casino tonight. We’re here till Tuesday so I’ll do my best to get over there!On another note, if they can sell beer and wine by the elevators, I don’t see why players can’t get comps for said beer/wine to be consumed in their rooms. Just something that crossed my mind. Here’s hoping we can get to a decent blackjack table that’s not auto-shuffle."
"Thank you for the update, I wanted that corn too lol. Hope his back is better and knock em out tonight!"
Tomorrow evening you will be treated to a beautiful full moon over the ocean. This comes after a partial lunar eclipse this evening . I hope the rest of your trip is nice and profitable.
"Thank you lesson4u63!i could really use the good vibes. Got beat in the casino last night while reading stories of others getting hand pays. Hopefully my luck turns tonight.For anyone interested, I have some pics and vids up on IG. Follow @sukie1220 Thanks!"
"I am sure if you went in the middle of the week, it would be a much nicer experience with less crowds. Regardless, it seems casinos are not following the 25% capacity rules, considering the large lines/crowds you mentioned. During normal times, I never go to AC on the weekends during the summer as a rule. I did it once and never again."
"Also, curious....did you take Greyhound bus there? If so, how full was the bus?"
"Ooooohhh that steak, you weren't kidding. Saw that and the check in line on your Instagram, ooofah"
You and your husband make a good looking and sharp couple. And i am sure everyone tells you that you have gorgeous hair! Very nice.
Mike - We drove down so can’t say about the bus.I have a view of the parking lot and it’s been a steady flow of cars in and out today.Thank you lesson4u63!ChristopherALL - I had the bone in ribeye and my husband had the beef Wellington. Both were excellent! Truly the highlight of the trip so far!
"July 4th was spent, mostly, in our room during the day because my husband’s back was killing him. Got lunch from Tazza around 1pm which seemed to be one of the few times the lines were short. Too scared to gamble after the beating I took the night before so just took advantage of the great view from our room. Eventually went to AC Burger for takeout dinner and it was pretty good (even got a strawberry lemonade vodka to take to the room which they seal when giving to you). Hit the casino and lost $200 quickly at the slots (not a bonus or anything even exciting to stretch the losing out). Tried $100 at a $25 blackjack table and actually was up $400 until someone had to join and take the great cards I been getting. Ended up cashing out at $175 so only down $25 last night!May be cutting early if hubby’s back doesn’t feel better."
Thanks for continuing update. Stay Safe. Hope you hit a winning streak today.
"Sukie your husbands back doesnt sound good,maybe ibuprofen,a chiropractor,or the worst,surgery,for a pinched nerve or something,not a dr. but worked in x-ray since 1968."
"jerry s - Yeah, it’s not good but this isn’t new. Poor guy has been dealing with this for 12 years. He’s tried everything just short of surgery which he doesn’t want. When it gets bad like this he just has to rest and take it easy on walking (hence why I’m not pushing to leave the casino as much as I’d like to let you guys know how other properties are doing). But thank you for the advice, he’s definitely looking for a chiropractor when we get back."
"I've had 3 lower back surgeries performed by a top neurosurgeon on the east coast.For me, I have learned that they only relieve breakthrough severe pain I have also learned that chiropractic adjustments are a big no no. Orthopedics advise to treat with heat, for me another no no.......Adding heat to inflammation is senseless to me, and worsens the conditionI do however agree that ice is the best for my condition. I always have/use those jell packs. It's a big chill at first, but usually relieves in 10 mins or so. Especially if i lay on a completely hard and flat surface........Staring at a ceiling for 20 minutes can have it's meritsAlso, in my case, remaining dormant or resting actually makes my situation worse.It's best if i move slowly, remain in motion and generally walk it off.You husband has to find what works for him.Good luckEdited: 11:23 am, July 05, 2020 "
"Petre D - One thing that has been helping is his inversion table (I forget what it’s called but you strap yourself onto it and hang upside down). That helps to open up the vertebrae and get those discs to slip back in. But it has to be done every day and being here he’s already missed 2. Agree re: ice v. heat. I’ve learned to go at his pace and not push him to do too much because it always ends up with him being in worse pain. But thanks for your advice, will make an ice pack for him now (got zip lock bags!)."
"yes different for every patient,a dr. studys symptoms to find out a help,my wife says look into laser,she worked in ct and me x-ray in a northern n.j. medical center until we retired.my wife has low immune system so putting off harrahs for awhile even though get free rooms during week,meals on her diamond.miss it though."
Remember to get a nice romantic picture taken outside tonight as a full moon will be over the ocean. Hopefully there isn't any fog. Good luck.
"IamNamcy - Hey! He’s definitely tried the acupuncture route and gotten some relief. The pool is still closed as of now. I have some video of it on my IG if you’re interested (@sukie1220).So just wanted to provide an update. Crowds seemed to have thinned out a bit today. We ventured out after 1:30 and were able to get sandwiches at Tazza with only 2 people ahead of us on line. Hung out on the area next to the AC Burger Baywalk yo enjoy some sun and maskless time outside of our room. Just had takeout from Martorano’s and it was well worth it! Shared the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigiana and Sicilian slice and it was hot and delicious. Got a glass of Pinot Grigio to enjoy out on that aforementioned outdoor while we waited for our order. While I wish there were more options, the ones available have been terrific. Gonna hit the casino after 11:00 pm. Hopefully tonight is our night! Wish us luck!"
Good Luck - Enjoy- Be Safe - Thanks for postings.
Thank you for your updates! It makes me miss AC and can't wait for visit in August. Hoping more restaurants will open up by then. Sending lots of good vibes to you and your hubby!
"Quick update - We have decided not to leave the casino this trip so I won’t be checking out Ocean (sorry). Last night after dinner the casino was busiest it’s been all weekend. Impossible to get on a blackjack table. Played slots for a bit (only lost $25) then decided to go back to the room and come back down around 3am. Well, we just slept right through the night. But, we so well rested we were up and out by 7:30 am and playing at a HOT blackjack table. I went in with $200 ($15 table) and walked away with $575. It would’ve been more but I was having too much fun to leave. It felt like old AC for a couple hours. The dealers are very strict, as they should be, about people wearing their masks correctly. The guy we were playing with couldn’t keep his over his nose and the dealer scolded him. Said he has a heart condition and needs everyone to wear a mask. Luckily, the guy was compliant. So as of now I’m only down $90 for the trip and I still have a whole day. Heading to Gordon Ramsay again tonight for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. Hitting the tables again between now and then and probably afterwards. Interesting side note, did you guys know there are tons of raccoons hanging out by that little walkway by the bus waiting area? Encountered a pack of 4 last night and witnessed a Jerry Springer style love triangle fight in the same area at the same time. Drama!"
thanks for the updates.glad to hear about your come from behind gambling recovery... and happy anniversary!
IamNancy - it’s the entrance/exit at the end of the walkway leading to AC Burger. The jitney does stop there I believe. And thanks to you and UK for the anniversary wishes. Looks like it may rain tonight so may be Martorano’s again lol.
"you might consider a virus test as you return home ,just to tell us you survived a casino?"
Can you confirm that the indoor pool and fitness center is closed?
"Email I received today from Harrah's lists""- No Spa, Pool or Gym"""
Definitely no pool or spa.Also wanted to mention that most of their hand sanitizing stations are not hands free. This is annoying and ineffective.
"Sukie1220, your husband sounds like mine with his back problems. He has tried everything but nothing really worked until he had a back ablation. They burn the nerve so he doesn't feel the pain when his back acts up. It works for about a year and when his back starts acting up, he had it done again."
Thank you for the informative updates! And happy anniversary!
"Hey everyone. Last night update.....some good news, I’m finally UP $187! This is after losing $600. I won it all back and then some on two awesome runs of blackjack this morning and this evening. As tempted as I am to put another hundred in a slot machine, they have not been kind to me this trip so I’m taking my humble winnings and backing away slowly.Some last thoughts.....Caesars failed with the hand sanitizing stations. Most of them were not touchless and, not only did you have to touch them, you had to hold onto them to make sure they didn’t tip over as you pumped. The hand sanitizer at the tables is literally soap! As in you pump it in6o your hand and a literal lather appears when you rub your hands together. Also, they failed big time re: food options. It is currently midnight and we’re ordering DOMINOS because there is nothing else to eat. Tazza has a line unto the casino and they’re already running out of food. Honestly, we’ve managed up to this point but this is ridiculous. Harrah’s has only ONE food option after 10pm during the week. Be aware of this if you plan on using those midweek comps.As far as outdoor dining, it’s great until it rains. Our reservation tonight was canceled and we were offered a takeout option. Considering steak is hard to cut with plastic cutlery, we passed. They definitely need to have more 24 hour options than Tazza. They are literally running out of food as I type this.Capacity - I’m having a hard time accepting this was 25% capacity. I’ve been here many times and they had as many tables open as they usually do (with less seats, of course). I, honestly, didn’t see a difference in capacity. This could be my perception because seats at tables were limited, etc. but, if you watch my IG videos, it was packed everywhere all the time. This morning was the first day it felt emptier but, by this evening, it was packed again.Table limits - Friday - Sunday was mostly $25 at blackjack, $15 roulette. Today I was able to get on a $15 table and made all the money I had loss back plus $187! I’ll take that as.a win, but it definitely sucked waiting for a seat and having people breathing on you waiting to vacate said seat (social distancing where?). Covid-related - I honestly can’t say I saw a single person cleaning a slot machine. However, the chips were constantly wet from being just disinfected. The table I played at had the plexiglass partition and we were all wearing masks and I felt relatively safe. But, definitely utilize all the hand sanitizing stations.Food - If you are willing to spend the money, Gordon Ramsay is a great option. However, the idea of eating out in the hot sun is not very appealing so I’m not sure how enjoyable Coastal Craft would be for their breakfast/lunch service. If you are looking to only eat where you’re staying, right now Harrah’s has very limited options. While they’re good in quality and flavor, they are limited in offerings and accessibility.Gambling - My experiences was that the slots were tight. I’m talking no bonuses, no fun hits, nothing to stretch the losing out. Only thing I did well with was blackjack and seats were hard to come by. Also, not having comped drinks made losing way more obvious. I think that rather than having pop-up bars by the elevators to sell wine and beer, they should have had a player rewards system so that players could get the wine and beer for sale comped. Overall, I’d say wait to come back until indoor dining resumes. Gambling was fun and all but, honestly, the lack of dining options made the experience negative. Shoutout to TiffaNYandNJ! It was awesome meeting you in person!"
Thanks for the continuing updates. Enjoyed reading them and appreciated you observations. Happy to hear about the turn around on Black Jack . Be Safe - Drive Carefully- Thanks again.
"Thanks for sharing all your observations Sukie, and happy anniversary. I think I will be cancelling the two reservations I had made for the summer and hold off until indoor dining and bars are open and running close to normal. If I don't go back until next year then it is what it is."
"Very good updates by all,thanks much.Yesterday Fauchi said virus is averaging 15 yrs younger now.Hope by September Harrahs has room service dining back.Stay safe all."
"Sukie - Thanks for sharing all the updates, glad you were able to end the trip on a winning note! I think your synopsis of wait till indoor dining is back is great advice, was thinking about heading down in a week or two but after hearing your experience I will probably wait till late August if at all this Summer."
"Thanks for the well wishes everyone! I’m doing a vlog for YouTube, will post again when it’s up.Quick happy way to end this trip....just threw a $50 in a Red Hot 7 machine and won $33.25. I’m now up $220.25 for what started as a losing trip!Edited: 10:55 am, July 07, 2020 "
Thanks for your great report. It cemented my decision to not go to Atlantic City at the moment.
"One important thing I forgot to mention, Harrah’s had NO ROOM SERVICE. If you’re going to AC, call the hotel and ask whether they will be doing room service."
""" Harrah’s had NO ROOM SERVICE. "" That would be one thing that I would expect all the hotels to be getting right. I assumed that in the case of Resorts, that Breadsticks was closed so that they could concentrate their efforts on room service."
"wow,they offer us an attrium suite but we dont spend enough time in room so we just get a regular room.i wonder if rooms are being cleaned now after weekend.Edited: 9:26 am, July 08, 2020 "
"Jerry, why would you think they aren't cleaning the rooms? Sukie, I'm surprised there's no room service. I assumed they would do it like takeout in a bag with plastic utensils and leaving it at the door, no coming in to the room with a tray like normal."
"lecc0221,i didnt assume but wondered as there is no room cleaning everyday as before.we have reservations in sept. but if covid19 gets worse as Fauchi says we would cancel again as wife has a low immune system after surgery for blood clot in a leg.this chat is more helpful then the pressplus newspaper,thank you."
"From my understanding, rooms aren't being cleaned during your stay but when you check out there will be a deep cleaning undertaken. If your wife is immunocompromised I personally would not take the risk. I am healthy but have some family members who are older and others with compromised immune systems and I do not want to risk coming into contact with someone and then being a asymptomatic carrier and putting them potentially in the line of fire. Its just not worth it. I've cancelled my August reservations and will wait until later in the fall or even next year, if need be."
"good advice,thank you."
"Housekeeping was available. They clean your room every day of your stay. Agreed that it was strange they didn’t offer room service. I assume they didn’t have enough staff to handle the orders. Otherwise, it made no sense."
Sukie 1220: Thanks so much for all your helpful information. We are planning a 1 night stay at Harrah's next Friday only because our host is coming a dinner at Gordon's for my husband's birthday. I'm still not quite sure where Gordon's setup is. Is it the same area where the large outdoorsundeck is on the 2nd floor of the Indoor pool? If not where exactly is it?
Going to Harrah's next Sunday
"Hi Iecc0221,We chatted a few years back.Anyway, I have to give you credit for your unselfish precautions. Be Well. .....115 degrees in Vegas this coming Saturday & Sunday - God I miss that place !Edited: 7:16 pm, July 08, 2020 "
"Kwokpot - That’s exactly where it is. You’ll get to walk through the pool area at night so maybe have your camera ready. All of the lounge chairs are gone and replaced with about 30 tables. If it’s a breezy night, you should be cool. Enjoy!"
"Just posted my very first vlog. If you’d like to see how my first day at Harrah’s went, check out https://youtu.be/D7JbPQ93zGc"
Great vlog! Thanks for doing that.
Regina J - Thank you! I actually just posted a few more. I did a full review but still not sure I should post. My lips look chapped from all the mask wearing. Lol!

"Johanna O - I did not see any buses stopping at Harrah’s. However, they could’ve been stopping at the main bus depot. My husband just mentioned that he didn’t recall seeing any buses on the way down either."
"Fast forward 5 days. Checked in with my brother who is a diamond, no masks or wipes given at check in,no food comps given for opting out of maid service next day. At elevators not every one working, so line to get on. No red sticker on door. We wiped down room with our own wipes. Playing in slots area near Diamond club,no one seen, 2 different days wiping down machines. A few people pulling down masks during play,no one said anything. Some people drinking on the sly. At both Ceasars and Harrarh's when we entered security no masks to give. Burger place had places to eat outside. Outside rooms at night many bags of trash and used towels and bed linen. Horrible sight."
"BTW no more in room coffee maker. Had to downstairs and pay nearly $6 for a large coffee. Will bring those bottled coffee drinks,if there is a next time."
"""BTW no more in room coffee maker. "" Can someone else report back on this, just to see how widespread this is!"
Definitely no coffee maker in the rooms at Harrah’s.
"no coffee,oh no,i'll need to take my wifes fathers truck driver dads 18 wheeler he drove thermos and stop t0 starbucks along way when we go.it only holds 5 cups,omg what will i do,i drink 3 cups a day!"

"Kwokpot - Thanks for the pool update. What sucks is their pool is always freezing. So now to get some relief from the mask outside of your room, you have to get into freezing water lol."
cool water means less algae in the pool!
Are they saying you cannot bring food or drinks or a cup of coffee into the pool area
Frank A - to answer your question (this is from Post #84 in this thread - part of the announcement sent out by Harrah's about the pool re-opening):*No Food & Beverage will be permitted or offered inside the pool area. No Smoking will be permitted

Thanks Sukie for all your information and insights.

"Ok thanks Sukie,we love dogs too but can be expensive to board out and vets. bills.we still dont know if AC will be safe for a weeks trip in september as my wife has the low immune system.Have fun!"
"DW and I seniors visited Harrahs midweek...Tuesday and Wednesday 7/28 & 9. Pretty much the same as 2 weeks ago. 1 Huge numbers of security were actively enforcing mask wearing. I saw very few people misbehaving. 2 Very few players in the am, 7 to 9am. Everybody was on the enormous line for coffee at Tazza. 3. The line for takeout at AC burger at dinner time was also humongous. We were forced to eat outside where it was quite hot. But we got seated promptly at an umbrella table. The food all came to us in a bag. 4 We brought our mini Keurig for the room. Thank goodness. Kept snacks and bevs in the room fridge.5 The pool was closed on Tue and Wed. WHY ???? 6 We did not see any sanitizing of machines. We think there may have been a crew early in the amWe would like to see Harrahs do better in many areas. Right now there are few if any amenities for players. But it sure would be nice to see the pool open all week, to see more coffee stations available, better dining options."
Do they have buffet open
There's no Indoor dining so no buffets.
"At Caesars, the buffet room is open as a pizzeria (take out only), so maybe the buffet room at Harrah's was converted to a take out restaurant."
"Here's a link to all of Caesars Entertainment AC Casino Restaurant offerings and their hours. Since there's a Pinup Pizza at the Harrah's Food Court the Buffet is NOT OPEN for any kind of Take Away Service.https://www.caesars.com/atlantic-city/openEdited: 4:51 pm, August 10, 2020 "
