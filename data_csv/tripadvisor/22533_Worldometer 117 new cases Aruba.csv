https:/…One day increase. Is this real?
Sounds about right for yesterday. Todays number was less.
54 today
Omg.How have they not shut it down yet?
"I don’t think they are planning another shutdown if it can be avoided. I’m still planning to head down there on Friday. Have my masks packed and ready to go.Edited: 11:16 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Thanks for the update. Considering the increase in testing, these are promising numbers. Aruba has done a great job in managing COVID during the transition back to open tourism. Does anyone have a link that documents COVID hospitalizations?"
"In no way shape or form are 117 new cases ""promising."" This is a disaster and the ""test when you get there"" protocol caused it. Hospitalizations generally lag new cases by 2-3 weeks, so for the love of god please don't start saying ""It's no big deal, there aren't a lot of hospitalizations"" to try and pretend this isn't an unmitigated disaster. We heard the same mularky in Florida and Arizona, at least until hospitalizations inevitably rose.Aruba needs to close right now."
"tedbaxter, you do realize this upsurge in cases was due to workers that came from Holland and didn't follow protocol. It has nothing to do with US tourists or taking the test there. The worker didn't follow protocol, worked at a nightclub, went to a gym and infected tons of people, all locals. For once, the tourists are not to blame for this. So even if Aruba closed, it wouldn't solve their problem as their problem now is homegrown."
Wally - here is the link with updated numbers. There are currently no hospitalizations. https://www.arubacovid19.org/
"Fair enough carolm, though there were several instances of US travelers being infected too, including the notable case of one ignoring the quarantine.Aruba has 2 choices. First is to limp along taking half measures that won't work, dragging this out for many weeks and months as it slowly gets worse. Or be decisive, close, lock down, and then in a month re-open with rigid protocols requiring ALL travelers in all states and Europe to be tested before they get on a plane. Allowing potentially infected people to be tested on the island after they may have infected others on the plane is simply a horrible decision."
"Ok. Thanks for the link Amy. Nice to see zero right now. It won't stay at zero, so now I am wondering how many serious COVID hospitalizations Aruba can handle at once. For some reason I thought someone on the island said (10) was the number."
"It was 11 ICU beds I believe but they have upped capacity to 33 in total because of Covid.Edited: 1:19 pm, August 10, 2020 "
The hospital has 33 ICU beds.
"Also note, the recent spread was isolated to a handful of locations frequented by younger populations, so hospitalization rates may stay low since the authorities were quick to contact trace and warn people of potential exposure. I dont think the island is taking half measures as per a comment above. They are following the lead of countries like South Korea and Germany who have the situation under control. Under control being, an understanding the virus is in the community, but taking measures to slow the spreading and trace potential cases. As a resident in a place that knows about governments taking half measures (our county just decided to let the public face covering mandate expire) I dont think calling Arubas measures half baked is an accurate portrayal. It looks like the number of positive cases has already begin to slow."
I agree with Ted 100%. I said it from day one testing on the island is a huge problem - 1) positive people could have been on your plane and 2) as strict as Aruba has been after people test there it’s a free for all. People are on the honor system and you know what that means. Also people are not hospitalized probably because they are young with mild cases. There are a lot of elderly tourists who go to Aruba who can be infected. I am watching every day. My husband and I are young for our age but in our 60s. Last thing we want is to get sick in a foreign country In a place with minimal ICU beds. We are scheduled to go on September 12th. Almost 100% we will cancel but waiting 2 weeks.
"Why won't they require a negative resulting test prior to arrival like some islands? Just curious what the reasoning is, if anyone knows. I was tested recently and it took less than 24 hours to get the results. I realize big cities may have more delay and my area has a lot of medical facilities and labs which makes it easier. I'm currently in Ohio."
"Aruba suggests testing before arriving but some states take many days to provide results. Aruba is giving 2 options, to test at home which is best or to test there which is an accident waiting to happen. Those in the UK and some others places say cannot get tests at home due to timeline. We are in the middle of a pandemic and it is not life or death to travel to Aruba now - although some of us think so lol. But we need to be smart sadly."
67 new cases reported today for yesterday with 513 total active cases.
Just spent a month on Sanibel Florida. Safe vacations can happen in hot spots. Not saying Aruba is a hotspot. The only wildcard are the airports. I drove 15 hours to avoid airports and I have a two year old. Airplanes seem safe though. Just use common sense.
According to an MIT study odds of catching it on a plane is slim.https:/…
"Hey I am in Aruba right now. I am at the Ritz. Hotel is enforcing mask more(outside) and sanitizing today before you sit. Everyone is wearing masks indoors. I checked the numbers for the first time since leaving after seeing change today. This change should have been in place already. Glad to see a drop in numbers. I got here Saturday and ate at a restaurant off site that took our temperature but the server put out forks on table after salad course with her bare hands. Not good. Most people are staying close to hotel, room service and take out. Lots of places are closed,reservations are a challenge. I cancelled a reservation at a more casual location because don't trust sanitizing and numbers. Do not plan on venturing to new places on this trip . Beach is why I came. You can get lulled into a false sense here at hotel. I stopped beach service, because there is too much handling-drinks, garbage and refilling guests personal water bottles. Yuck!! Palm Beach is empty, so upgrades are easy and as I walked this morning around 7:30am, no one was sitting under a palapa at any resort. Make an informed decision before coming. Bring what makes you comfotable. I have gloves, goggles, cloth filtered disposable mask and Clorox wipes. Wore N95 on plane and in taxi. Used gloves to go to bathroom and handle luggage in airport. Again make a decision that you are comfortable with."
We also have N95 masks that we clean using UVC light (got some lab tested/US made wands before they sold out. Was your N95 easier to breathe in than the cloth kind? I noticed some have a type of valve which helps get rid of the built up CO. Breathing is my main concern. Don't want to pass out. Hot locations mixed with hard to breath masks is asking for trouble too. Did you see anyone on the plane or airports in which they did not wear a mask (allowed due to medical reasons)?
"I only used N95 on plane and is airport. If I am not mistaken. I even switched to surgical mask to sleep on plane. I have cloth with filters that I use in evening for dinner and I have a supply of surgical masks that I use at resort. Masks with valves are banned on airline. I would suggest wearing N95 as a test at home. Do not wear mask for first time on trip. No one was really talking on flight, so I found the mask experience to be fine. I had multiple disposable gloves that I found useful in airport, bathroom on plane and when I got my luggage."
"Here we go again @Johnnytram0023 You literally post the same political garbage on every thread. If you hate your country so much move but stop talking about what Aruba is doing when you have no idea. All of the positive cases were not traced back yo the 3 contact spots. The government barely tested anyone for months, allowed locals to return from Colombia snd Europe w no test and its been slowly spreading there. You still cant get tested there unless you meet specific criteria. The govt flat out has stated testing for prevention does not work. People are on here trying to make decisions about their vacations and your misguided info isnt helping. Your vacation came and went so not sure why you are still on here trolling every day."
"Does anyone generally suspect that other islands may have similar hidden numbers, as few seem to have been testing locals much? We are still astonished at this outbreak after selecting Aruba as a (relatively) safe getaway several weeks ago. But perhaps it is as bad elsewhere in the Caribbean, in reality..?"
"I believe the same as oslo. Viruses are everywhere and this one is simply a new strain in which the world wasn't ready. Remember, it didn't come about naturally and has been traced to experiments in a lab which had already been reported to lack proper safety protocols and was even warned. What a mess.Edited: 12:47 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"<< Remember, it didn't come about naturally and has been traced to experiments in a lab >>Thanks for the chuckle !"
"While it is true that the exact origination is speculation, that lab had been warned previously about protocols. That's why some believe it was from there since it started in that city. It's been claimed that after much investigation it may not have originated (original mutation) from the wet market. Either way, somewhere someone may have handled the animals which had contact with bats. I'm not trying to be political at all. This is something we all are dealing with now on a daily basis. Bottomline... clean, clean, clean our hands as best we can and do what we can to protect others. Maybe we'll have less cases of the flu too."
"To move this back to the original post and try to ignore some of the rhetoric and ridiculous, Aruba has no reason to fabricate data. Their entire economy is based on tourists trusting the island to be a safe location for family vacations. If they are caught fabricating or telling people its safe when it is not, the long term negative effect will dwarf the small positive rewards of allowing a few visitors in now.Those who have been to the island will tell you and describe the extent to which the island is trying to prevent the spread of Covid 19. The rest of the people posting here, who have not witnessed the protocols in place, have only the experience from their homes to go on. If my only experience on how any place was trying to stop the spread of covid was based purely on what we are doing here in South Florida, I would be hesitant to travel as well. All I can say is, from the experience we had on the island, there is an effort being put forth by the government of Aruba, the businesses of Aruba and the citizens of Aruba to try and stop the spreading of this virus. Period.!"
"The problem is they had only tested 2000 people in 4 months so who knows how much it was spreading and even still are only testing locals if you have symptoms or had direct contact with a positive case. Locals, including my family, are not happy with this. They need to get this under control now because the island is broke and the govt isnt assisting."
"@Customer S - They had zero cases and closed borders. No need to have a national testing program in place. Once borders opened they expected cases to spring up and implemented the plan they had for such that situation. Is it the right plan, the best plan, a plan that will work, I dont have that answer, but they have a plan and if you trust their process then you should plan your travels accordingly. As I said, while I was on the island with my family we saw the plan and protocols at work. If you read my trip reports you know we were all over the island, including local barber shop, snack trucks, shacks, local bars, and even attempted to go to a local music concert. Even very local establishments had sanitizing stations set up., and various ways of diverting foot traffic to keep distancing in effect. My main point has always been, they have a national plan in place, and those looking to travel there need to realize this. For us, coming from Florida, it was both shocking (in a good way) and refreshing. Thats not a political statement, just an observation based on my experience at home."
"So they have now tested 8000-something people outside the airport, and almost 10% were positive. I wonder how high the rates would be if they tested everyone, including the asymptomatic?"
"Good Post. No-one knows for sure what is going on or is going on unless your in the government. The best of all the info that we have is that the Island did not test at all until two people came to work in the desalinization plant way back in April or March. They had it and were put in quarantine. From what we guess the government did not test and needed to get the island open because they were running out of money. They had to open and I doubt that they can shut down again. Speculation has it that the government will run out of money by September 1st without the normal tourist traffic. The government is paying 60% of the lost local salaries. Hopefully this is not true but the local cases at last count went up 18%. 81 and 87 positive on approximately 1,000 tests. God Bless our Island Family. If this gets really bad where people Start needing to be hospitalized then what. Holland should help them out even though they are a sovereign country."
"@Bobby - Holland has lent Aruba money, which Aruba used to support the community during the shut down. Conversations I had with Aruban residents seemed to suggest an internal political debate that is going on. Holland has threatened to stop providing assistance if Aruba doesnt meet certain requirements, including giving Holland more control over local politics. The current administration on the island does not want Aruba to go back to having to answer to Holland for local decisions, and hence is trying to find alternative ways to support the economy (bringing in US tourists for example). It was enlightening, speaking to residents, many have a desire to let Holland reassert some control on the island. While the vitriol is nothing like our politics here in that States, you can sense a very equal divide among those who want to stay on the path of autonomy and those willing to seed some controls back to Holland.Time will tell, but I think if things worsen, and Aruba has to shut its borders again, there may not be a choice in the matter."
"Johnnytram again...what plan and protocols? Masks were not required until recently locals were flying in untested, nightclubs and bars were open with no limit on occupancy? Still no testing if you dont meet certain criteria. Its the same situation everywhere, same govt mismanagement and corruption. The locals know they need tourism badly so they dont exactly bash the island to the tourists so you dont get the full story talking to your waiter or tour guide. Aruba is no different than other places and you just think so because you were here on vacation for a couple weeks your tourist goggles on."
Well said Customer...I lived in Aruba for 5 years and found out (the hard way in some cases) NEVER to say or write anything which could be seen to be detrimental to tourism there. They take keeping the unvarnished truth away from the tourist market VERY seriously.
"@Customer S - you talk about things you dont know. We dont stay at the Ritz or Hyatt and hang out with Americans during our vacation. We stay in a place that is a vacation spot for Aruban residents as well as people from Holland and the US. Our weeks in late July also coincide with Arubas last few weeks of summer vacation, so I am not just speaking with my waiter or tour guys. I also hang out at local bars in the middle of the island and talk to the people who work in the balashi plant, for WEB. Spend a minute or two reading my trip reports before you down play my experience.And by the way, I talked to many people who where critical of the governments response INCLUDING some who thought it was a bad idea to let anyone in."
"So ""only"" 19 new cases today but only 300 new tests done since yesterday...? This does not seem to be tapering off much..."
"@Liz - The update from Aruba today was extremely discouraging. You are correct that fewer than 300 tests were performed today but if you read further, only 60 were done on locals. The rest were done at the airport. All of the positives were locals so the positivity rate for locals today was about 30%!This is extremely disturbing because the government cannot adequately contact trace when they don’t know if people are positive. Much more testing needs to be done to identify every single positive person and get them quickly isolated and contact traced. I have a real bad feeling...."
"@brokedoc - Good grief that is terrifying :( Based on what others have said here it does sound like the government might be trying to put a spin on things to save tourism, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence..."
"And when people say it’s the locals getting infected not the tourists - that’s not good news for tourists - the locals work at the supermarkets, hotels, restaurants, activities etc. Also I did read that Aruba is running out of tests which is a concern as well."
"@Colette M - can I ask where you read that re the tests? I have been running offical statements through Google Translate which thinks Papiamento is Spanish, so the results are so-so, but this seems like an awfully rosy take:https://www.arubacovid19.org/post/grafico-no…"
@Liz T. I read it last week on one of the forums. I believe it was the Aruba.com forum. But there is a statement today On that website from someone who knows a doctor who lives in Aruba part if the year. He told her they are running out of tests. Not sure what’s true anymore. But they are sending doctors and nurses from Curacao to help.
