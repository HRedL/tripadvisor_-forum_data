Wanting to know if there is any information on Coronavirus in Mazatlan.Reading Canadian Government web site information as of today Feb 29 México not on the list of travel alert countries.Supposed to be flying from Winnipeg to Mazatlan March 13
2 cases confirmed in culiacan
I also saw a report there were cases in Mexico City.
"1 in Cullican, 2 in Mexico City, NONE in Mazatlan. (So far.)"
"National news here in Mexico says the two cases that were under observation (one in Mexico City and one in Culiacan) had both returned from a conference in Italy recently. They both have just been cleared after no longer showing symptoms. So that's very good news.Edited: 6:56 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Obviously most nations or countries will not be exempt from people being exposed to the virus, what matters is what is done once somebody is found to be infected. It's gonna take time to sort out, so keep calm & wash your hands. Safe travels  Life is good."
Thanks for this information.Interesting how it isn’t reported in the media!
Main thing is wash hands frequently and stay away from people coughing and/or sneezing. I saw a map of the world from Google yesterday and No marks in Mazatlan.
"Got here yesterday. While buying supplies seen two workers in walmart wearing masks (could be unrelated), otherwise not a peep about it"
Unrelated. We frequently see people wearing medical masks out in public. It is in the local news as to any new cases in Mexico. The few they have reported are linked to travel to Italy. None in Mazatlan at this point.
"""Interesting how it isn’t reported in the media!"" Not sure what 'media' you look at, but I see it in many places here in Mazatlan."
We USED to have a lot of orientals on the cruise ships and MANY wor masks. I have seen NONE since the virus has been in the news. Nor have my other volunteers.
"We were just in Mazatlán mid February and planning to visit PV in March, but have decided to stay put until the coronavirus runs its course. New cases are popping up here and there, so will avoid air travel for the time being. Will miss our annual PV fix, but there’s always next year!"
Remember...you have an airport and an airplane to worry about too!!!
Sorry but not understanding your answer !Does this mean Covid19 is in Mazatlan?
Waiting for Sunwing to cancel our trip.I’m sure it will be any day now.
I have not heard of anyone having coronavirus in Mazatlán
Thanks This eases my mind somewhat!
There are a couple dozen confirmed cases on a cruise ship that ported Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan in Mid Feb. Confirmed none. Is it there? Highly probable. We just returned from Mazatlan yesterday. Wash Hands.
Then why is it so hard to get accurate information on wether or not Covid19 is actually in Mazatlan????I’m really getting tired of this.....should I goOr cancel my trip It’s fine if one is retired I’m not! Frayed nerves!
"You have very very valid concerns. You should consider cancelling your trip and stay where you are. When a vaccine is available, come on down and have a great time."
"You are clearly spooked, and comments on here will not convince you. Don't go!"
"It makes no difference to me if there are cases confirmed here or not. As far as I'm concerned it's here and a lot of other places that it hasn't been confirmed.But you'll be traveling through airports, on planes, taxis, bathrooms, hand rails. food places....etc. I wouldn't be so focused Mazatlan's status."
"Actually, I just read a report from the Center for Disease Control stating the number of cases of Covid19 is very low and Mexico remains very low risk as of today’s date!The site also provided a map of Mexico which was very helpful to actually view the areas of concern.It pays to be persistent and to keep trying to seek out reliable information and reputable sites."
"I have my N95 Mask ( I’m an RN!) my hand sanitizers and my hospital grade disinfectant wipes Plan to wipe down everything in my immediate environment and wear the maskYes they do provide protection, that’s why I have to wear it at work!"
Why should I cancel?
"Nerve, Make sure your N95 mask is not expired like 55 million N95 masks in Ontario are."
Oh great...you will be at a crowded airport...and on a crowded plane...and then come back to work as an RN and be sick? I would think your employer would have an answer to your question about going or not??And wearing a mask when you are not sick...they are telling us all over and over and over again to not do that. Why would you as a nurse wear one then?
"What's the latest count in Mexico and where they? I heard it was up to four. Thanks all!Edited: 7:22 pm, March 09, 2020 "
I have made an informed carefully thought out decision and I am taking precautions and doing what I have to do to protect myself My employer has policies in place and I am well aware of them and I won’t necessarily be sickHowever this is getting beyond the topic so I respectfully decline to answer any other questions
"Neire154954 You asked, you were answered. What more can we tell you other than THERE ARE NONE CONFIRMED as yet."
"Not a Medical person. But IMO, the ""damage"" of Covid-19 seems to me to be more to our 401K caused by fear and irrational over-reactions. Overreaction to fear of the unknown rather than to getting actually :""sick"".. Just sayin..."
It's going to be an ugly quarter for international and domestic commerce. Hopefully the 2nd quarter will show some recovery. Mazatlan is doing very well we definitely don't need another 2008 to dry things up for 5+ years.
"Travel Judy, why are you so negative about everything Mazatlan. I will be getting on an airplane, flying to Mazatlan, staying at Las Flores, laughing at the banda bands and drinking a Pancho's Margarita to scare the germs away in 12 short days. I also did the unthinkable today, I went to lunch with friends. Is Corona serious, yes but the flu has killed thousands more."

Good advice thanks.Planning to stay away from the port where cruise ships dock and the city centre on those days.Plan to give everything extra cleaning with disinfectant wipes and of course good handwashing Cleaning my seat and surroundings on the plane
'In Mexico cleanliness is next to impossible .'huh?
"Drink a Pacifico, enjoy a Dirty Monkey, the food, and rejoice. You are probably significantly more likely to get it coming to a gas station door handle near you soon."
Stay safe everyone.
"Some Provinces in Canada have just advised against any travel anyplace outside of Canada.If you go, you must go into home Insulation for 2 weeks on return.Edited: 6:58 pm, March 12, 2020 "
We cancelled our Mazatlan trip today!I’m so sad!My Health Authority issued an edict to employees to avoid travel outside of Manitoba.We had already decided to cancel based on a number of factors but if we hadn’t decided the decision was already made for us.
Hopefully when this all blows over you can reschedule.
Next year definitely!Hasta luego Mazatlan!
Brooliyn….. had to go back to understand your recement. LOL.
"My daughter, a director of a child development center in Bremerton, WA called yesterday and advised us to remain in Mazatlan. I agree with her as we're safer in Mazatlan"
Just a guess but I think 'home Insulation' is probably pretty similar to 'home ISOLATION'.
"Canadians urged to return from abroad ASAP because flight options may be reduced in upcoming weeks. In Edmonton school classes cancelled, day cares closed city recreational facilities closed, libraries closed, senior centres closed, businesses shutting down, West Edmonton Mall pool closes...and so on. Upon return 2 weeks self-isolation"
"I got an alert a couple hours ago that here are now FOUR CONFIRMED cases in the STATE of Sinaloa. It did not break it down by city, and I am still waiting to hear about the two suspected cases here in Maz. (Today was a holiday and NOTHING interrupts a Mexican 3 day weekend!)"
"CDC U S A this morning says there are a total of 52 cases in all of Mexico,. same as yesterday I would have thought it would have been much higher since more tests have become available. I guess we are in a holding position for awhile, gotta wait & see how this shakes out. Stay calm, wash your hands often, & stay away from crowds Safe travels Life is good."
"Mexico now has 82 cases.Rather than go back to infectious Washington, my husband has requested I protect myself and continue my stay on Stone Island, so I am riding out the storm here.With the exception of a certain prescribed medication, I never have to go back into the city area. (Even that can be gotten thru the Isla pharmacy at a higher cost) There is a bank close to the Principal Embarcadero in Mazatlan, for money. I feel blessed to be here."
"Hi Pamela we've gotten ourselves back home but looking forward to hearing from you about how this is affecting folks on Isla in the next days. Stay safe.Edited: 6:27 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"I crossed the border last Sunday. Except for the line of cars to get to the crossing, it was a breeze. She asked a few questions, processed my passport, took a quick look in my car and sent me on my way. Got waved thru the inspection station and I was out a there. All that worry for nothing...."
