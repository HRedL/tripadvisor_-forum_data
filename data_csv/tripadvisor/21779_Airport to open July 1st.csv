Yep.
"Applies to the airport. Port is still closed to cruise shipsFrench side has to planes to/from US.Edited: 9:52 am, June 20, 2020 "
"Sorry, French side has NO planes from US"
"I'm glad that they are considering opening the airport, but most of the visitors will be coming from Europe, the USA and Canada, all places with continuing Covid-19 infections. Masks IN the airport are good, but what about OUTSIDE the airport?We would be looking for fairly consistent exercising of physical distancing and mask wearing in public places, as we have here. Without that, the danger of transmission is significantly increased once you introduce people from locations where Covid-19 is still circulating.While it is only ""recommended"", I find the requirement to have a Covid-19 test WITHIN 72 hours of flying to be problematic, at least here in Ontario. I wonder if they are referring to the time of the test or the date on the results? Right now, when you have a test you can expect your results within 4 to 7 days, not 3. Also you still need a reason to actually have a test. Non-essential vacation travel isn't one of the reasons.Lots of details to obviously still be worked out and lots of time to hopefully sort them out before we travel in January. It is a small first step. Let's hope it goes well, but I do have my concerns for the safety of island residents, let alone visitors."
"""We would be looking for fairly consistent exercising of physical distancing and mask wearing in public places, as we have here. Without that, the danger of transmission is significantly increased once you introduce people from locations where Covid-19 is still circulating.""We have that now.. You can't go inside anywhere without a mask and I think MOST are social distancing. At least during the daylight hours before the HH crowds arrive. I expect that will go by the wayside when tourists arrive."
"Yes, see post #1 where it says rules"
"The ""rules"" are written in a way to allow some flexibility on their side, but that doesn't mean there are no rules. It says you will be subjected to a health check and may be required to take a covid test. It also says showing up with results from a clean test is recommended. So, while the pre-test is optional, I would sure recommend showing up with one so that my health-check was relatively quick and easy, compared to someone else who is getting the full treatment and potential quarantining.St Barth has posted similar, rules, but more strictly phrased. You must show up with your pre-done test or you will be isolated on island until you take a test there. St Maartens rules allow them to do just that if they feel it is warranted."
"Flying from the UK to Amsterdam then on to SXM, I can't take a KLM as it takes 24-48 hours to get the results.We may be able to get tests in the UK soon....for £140 each, so thats a big sum for a family of 5.....and again how do I have a test within 72 hours of travel when it may take 72 hours to get the results from that test?However, the UK is not testing unless we display symptoms.Will probably have to wait and see what tests they are going to carry out upon arrival, and what they are going to do for people who haven't taken a test before arriving. Still just over 6 weeks until we travel anyway...things may be different by then,Edited: 3:34 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"Sorry, I'm missing your point Surf.Edited: 3:56 pm, June 20, 2020 "
I have no idea. The above is all that has been released.
"I tried to get a test last week. I had chest congestion, stuffy head and felt fatigued but no other symptoms. I was refused a test but got prescribed chest and head xrays instead. Tests are hard to get in WA State. All was clear and feel fine now but was hoping for the test"
Does this mean we can plan travel only for the dutch side or will we be able to head over to french st.martin as well for tourism?
The Dutch/French border is open.
"CVS offers 'free' testing in Mass, Conn, RI, Michigan and Georgia with 30 minute results. Many more states have results in 2-4 days, which might work. Unfortunately you must live in the state where testing is done (I suspect that is to allow CVS to get reimbursed by the state.)Also, you need to have self-reported symptoms. I myself am not good at lying, but it is just a box ticked off on an online form."
"Surf, just for you, I did a google search and found letsgetchecked dot com that offers 24 hour results from a home test. One would need to order the kit and be ready. Then take the test 2 days before the trip, fedex the sample to the lab, and then get the result within 24 hours. I not saying you or anyone else should be clowning around with all this just to take a vacation, but it does seem do-able if one really needed to go. No doubt the system will get refined in the next few weeks and I think erring on the side of safety rather than convenient was the right way to get things started."
"I think the goal is to get tourist money while not getting everyone sick. Also, it could be that by being careful they actually increase people's interest because it feels safe. I know I wouldn't want to go if it were just a free for all. On the other hand I'm not traveling anywhere so maybe I'm not a good survey point."
"It does say 72 hour COVID test is ""RECOMMENDED"" not ""required"""
It also says have to provide proof of test.
"In other words you can't just say you've had a test and have no proof.It does seem that if you can, you should take a test and turn up with your certificate. If you can't or haven't had a test and you turn up, you're going to have to undergo a rapid test (results within the hour) upon arrival whilst those with certificates are waved through and on their way."
"In other words, you don't have to have a test because it's just recommended, but you have to prove you had it."
They made it mandatory.https:/…
"Just saw the update that ""passengers are required to take a COVID-19 RT-PCR test, with proof of negative results no older than 72 hours prior to day of travel"". They changed recommended to required. However they may have created 2 additional questions. The first is they changed the Covid-19 test to the RT-PCR test. There is another rapid test ( 1hr) that is available called the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen that correlates well with the RT-PCR test. Sometimes getting a RT-PCR test result in under 72 hours is not guaranteed whereas the Quidel Sofia test takes 15 mins and results to the patient within 24 hours. The second is the ambiguity of ""results no older than 72 hours prior to day of travel"". Does that mean your sample was taken less than 72 hours before day of travel or that your sample was taken before 72 hours but the results were time stamped/ released / logged from the testing source less than 72 hours prior to day of travel. Hopefully, these two areas can be clarified as it could make the difference whether people can actually make it or not."
"We fly into SXM on July 4th....Has there been any talk about what happens if you don't have a test (like will they do a rapid test at the airpor, which I'm TOTALLy fine with)? I am scrambling to get them, but here they are NOT readily available, and I'm concerned the mail in ones won't get us our results in time......"
You won't be allowed on the plane. You must meet the requirements before the airline will board you.
Not entirely true as de Weever said that if anyone turned up without the proper certification they would be quarantined and they have a hotel set aside for this purpose.
I believe that was the rules for returning ex-pats. Not doing that now. Airlines are supposed to check requirements before boarding. You won't get on the plane if you don't have a return ticket either. It's the rules
Was only going by her interview on Island 92 this morning.....she said it would apply once the new rules kicked in on July 1st
"I'm listening to the recording now, and the example they used, is if you know it takes six days to get a test result, make sure you time it so you have the RESULTS 72 hours prior. We have until 6/27 to cancel our hotel, so I want to be sure we know if we can meet the requirements."
"And thats what I find strange, you could have the test 6,7,8 even 9 days before travel, but as long as the results are dated within three days you're ""good to go"".....a lot can happen in more than a week! It seems to me having followed this for a few weeks now, that originally they were going to carry out rapid tests on everyone on arrival. Then they found they didn't have the tests or resources to carry this out so they've ""passed the buck"" to the traveller to gain a test before arrival, even if it leaves loopholes like i've highlighted above.According to the interview it is still the Governments intention to get to a position where they can test everyone on arrival, they're just not ready for that yet, but need tourism to return to boost the economy."
"Yeah, I agree with you completely. I'm not entirely sure she is right to be honest. I expect clarification, because what if it turns out the lab I go to is really caught up all of a sudden, and while it normally takes 5 days, and I'm coming Saturday so I do it on Tuesday, and the results come back Wednesday. That's more than 72 hours. But had the results from the same test come back Thursday, I'd be good to go? Nonsensical. Just hoping for clarification before my seven day cancellation window closes;) I did find a company that can do an online test with results in 24 hours (and you overnite the sample), so that may be the route we go."
Just make sure it's a reliable testing lab. Check their stats on accuracy before you use them.
"What about the accuracy of the person doing the test. I can get a test sent to my house, take my own swabs and send them away...they come back negative and all is goodExcept what happens if i didn't do the swab test properly.....didn't stick the thing far enough up my nose, and now I could have a false negative.....but i've got a piece of paper which is good enough for St Maarten Immigration and Health Officers.!"
This is an FDA approved SALIVA PCR test that you have to have supervised via zoom while performing.:)
"My apologies Simon, I had not heard that yet. They change their minds so quickly here."
"They did say it was open to review on almost a daily basis!! @Rhonda K Unfortunately we do not have that option here in the UK, only just started the first trial of the saliva test in one town, that will take place over the next 4 weeks."
"""This is an FDA approved SALIVA PCR test that you have to have supervised via zoom while performing.:)""What is the accuracy?"
"Turn around time is 24-48 hours from them receiving it.....I won't go into the full study results, but it was developed at Rutgers. I pulled a quote from the study below. I'm a Masters Prepared Nurse, so I do have some medical experience.There was 100% positive and negative agreement between the results obtained from testingof saliva and those obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Overall mean Ctvalues were similar for saliva and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, there wasno correlation between Ct values from different samples from the same patient. Nevertheless,the results support the use of saliva as a specimen type for use with the Rutgers ClinicalGenomics Laboratory TaqPath SARS-CoV-2 Assay."
Really was looking forward to my trip in August. Looks like I will have to postpone or cancel all together. 72 hour requirement just isn't feasible. Good luck to everyone still trying to make the best out of this!
"The St. Maarten government is obviously trying to find a way to keep everyone on the island safe, while still reopening the island to tourism for the sake of the economy. Both are laudable goals, but they seem to have a less-than-accurate understanding of the state of testing in many locations.I suspect they found it would either be impractical, or too expensive, to do the testing upon arrival, or the testing equipment they need is not available. Much of it is back-ordered. So they pushed the testing off to the home countries of the travellers.Nothing wrong with that, but 72 hours before flight is a very narrow time-frame. It will be impractical for many of us, in terms of timing. If the test result is too early or too late, then it is of no use and it will usually be too late to cancel your flight and accommodation arrangements. That is a potentially expensive crap-shoot.Let me give you an example here in Ontario. My wife and her sister just had their first Covid-19 tests done. They needed the tests to be able to visit their father, who is almost 101, in his retirement home.It has been in lockdown since mid-March. The home fortunately remained Covid-19-free. Now that they have been approved to reopen to visitors, you need to have had a negative Covid-19 result. It must be redone every two weeks.The province is still ramping up its testing capacity as we slowly reopen. The hold-up is the lab processing, since that needs to be increased to handle the increased volume. The standard is to have the results to you within 4 days. Both of theirs took 7 days and it required a phone call on the 7th day to get the results. Those results are still not posted on the website! They are obviously short-staffed to even be able to post the results, once completed. So lots of kinks in the system at this point.The tests don't actually take long to process, but there is a shortage of equipment at the testing labs, so the test kits are backed up waiting to be processed. Plus, every jurisdiction and country is still competing to get their hands on more testing equipment, let alone the test kits themselves. I suspect many are having similar problems.Finally, I don't even know if the test we are having done here is the one required by the St. Maarten government. I have no control over it anyway. As to proof, they are not currently issuing a paper certification, so will a screenshot be sufficient? More things to check!Unless the process improves here, it will be problematic to time our tests to be assured of having the results within 72 hours of arriving. That window is actually more like 48 hours, since flights to SXM from Toronto leave early in the morning, so we will need them by the day before. Lots of issues and potential hassles. We will have to wait and see, but if nothing changes significantly we will have no choice but to push our 5-week reservation off until January 2022. We will need to make a decision by the middle of November, so we will have to wait and see."
"Seems a lot has changed in a couple of weeks....This was the original plan.....Panneflek said within 15 minutes, guests will receive a welcome drink and a St. Maarten-style reception while they get the rapid test. They can also go through immigration processing at the same time. “In this new normal, we believe that this approach will also help the visitors who are anxiously waiting to return to beautiful beaches and sun in the sea, to be comfortable choosing our destination,” he added.https://thedailyherald.sx/islands/panneflek-…"
"And if the EU goes that route, many islands will fall under the order. French St Martin????????"
"I don't know the answer to that one! They have already said they will do temperature checking of every passenger......again, what do they do if someone is exhibiting a fever having just come off a plane they may have been on for 10 hours?Whats the solution? After all we are talking about a relatively small number of people here...how many flights in a day? 6 from the US? Three or four a week from Europe?"
Some states in the US are imposing quarantine on other states......https:/…continuous-coronavirus-update
"Well, our plan was 7 people for the last week of July. We just decided to ""throw in the towel"" and find an alternative domestic location, for the following reasons.1. Mandatory RT-PCR testing results within 72 hours of departure ( Test turnaround times are too unpredictable)2. Requirements can change at the last minute (ie. recommended testing to mandatory testing change within a few days)3. They have a little over a week to get the portal up and running for all international travelers to enter health survey and upload test results to be validated that they aren't fake?4. TEATT was supposed to make an announcement on 6/15 but that didn't come out on time, the minister when interviewed mentioned that FAQ's would be posted on the insurance, etc... yesterday, still not available or I could not easily find today so far.5. Concerns that a restriction by EU members on US tourist could be adopted by overseas territories6. If there was surge in my State, would they then ban residents from that stateToo many unknowns"
"It is amusing that NY Gov. Cuomo threw a fit and threatened to sue Rhode Island for trying to require quarantine for visitors from NY back on March 28th, but Cuomo now calls it ""common sense"" to do the same to Florida visitors to NY. I personally think it is reasonable to block people to and from from hotspots. It is also no surprise that politicians are as fickle as the wind.Actually some think that Cuomo's shutting down all the NY universities in March and scattering a couple hundred thousand students out across the country (the exact opposite of his now ban on states with hotspots) played a significant role in spreading Covid around.So yes, the islands should do whatever they feel is reasonable, without regard to the convenience of the travelers. If you can't get a 24 hour test in your state, province or country, complain to your government, not to St Martin's."
The Sonesta just called and cancelled our reservation for July 4th...they are not going to open until 'at least August' she told me on the phone....
2020 Summer flight schedule posted by Princess Juliana Airport.https:/…
Im flying out Saturday July 4th and hoping for the best. Having covid test monday. Urgent care said results in 3-5 days so hoping to hit the 72 hour window. Fingers crossed!
Jen where are you staying? We are looking at Simpson Bay now.
"If I am flying into SXM from the US but staying on the French side, will I be able to cross the border? Couldn’t tell for sure by reading the posts on whether the French side is open. Trip planned for August 1st. Thank you."
Right now borders are open with no restrictions. Anything can happen between now and then.

This really saddens me and am embarrassed to be an American. The irresponsibility in the US is ridiculous. Why I wanted to get out of here and be in SXM to begin with.
A lot of people are having difficulties with getting quick COVID-19 test results.....Try My Concierge MD in Los Angeles for RT-PCR test as they are getting 24 hour results and allowing people to travel without issues .....highly recommend to all
Many travelers are using a facility in Los Angeles called My Concierge MD as they are providing 24 hour results for RT-PCR Covid test that meets all the requirements ...you should have no issues using them if flying out of L.A.
