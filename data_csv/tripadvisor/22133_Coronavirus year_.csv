"The Salzburg Festival have announced that there will be a festival this year, albeit reduced - which is great news, obvs!We’re hoping to get tickets for the last week (end of August) when booking opens on Monday. But it seems that at present U.K. nationals will need a Coronavirus certificate to enter the country. Trouble is, you can’t get such a thing in the U.K. unless you have symptoms or unless you are employed in certain occupations. Anyone know whether this is a temporary ban, or whether it might be lifted in the next few weeks? All advice gratefully received."
"Sorry, wrong title - I meant Coronavirus enquiry!"
"your doctor will advise you. he can arrange a test but at a price! according to news programmes, you should expect around 300£ for a doctors test. alternatively you could fly into vienna and have a test in the airport, but of course, if you fail, you will have to return to uk. and i dont think that there are any flights into salzburg.however if you read other relevant posts on this forum, you should see that the situation is totally fluid and the most notice that you could expect of any change would be t weeks at the most"
"""alternatively you could fly into vienna and have a test in the airport""I'm afraid this is not an option for OP. They won't be able to get tested at VIE because without the test they won't be admitted into Austria in the first place.This would only work for Austrian seeking to avoid quarantine.Edited: 5:41 pm, July 10, 2020 "
they CAN be tested at vienna airport!viennaairport.com/currentinformation
There are various private companies offering tests by post in UK---just google Covid 19 test for travel or you can book an appt at Vienna airport.
You also need a completed Medical Certificate that can be download from Austrian Embassy Websitehttps:/…COO_2026_100_2_1752893.pdfsig
"I re-post this from the 'Arrival by train' thread:----Update from the Austrian Embassy in London in reply to an email enquiry:Dear Mr. xxxx,All travellers coming from the UK must provide a health certificate with a negative COVID-19 test result. This rule has been extended until September 30, 2020.We hope this information is helpful.Kind regardsAustrian Embassy London+44 207 344 325018 Belgrave Mews WestLondon SW1X 8HU---And from https:/…coronavirus-information""Entry Requirements for UK CitizensNon-essential travel between the UK and Austria is currently strongly discouraged by both the Austrian and the UK government. Whilst we very much look forward to a time when we'll be able to welcome you back as usual, there is currently no specific date set by the Austrian government when this will be the case.If you have to travel (for instance, for medical reasons or for work), you can enter Austria as a UK citizen if:You can produce a health certificate in German or English, which is not older than four days and which confirms that the molecular biological test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative,ORYou agree to a self-monitored 14-day quarantine immediately upon arrival."""
It is odd that the UK government are no longer saying that you should not travel to Austria but the Austrian sites still say both governments are only allowing essential travel. No wonder everyone is confused. Spoke to hotel owners in Austria they think we need the test but not suggesting we cannot travel for leisure but maybe that is because they need tourists (as long as they do not have the virus).
"It appears that Austria tourist information website is stating that Austrian Government is only allowing essential travel for all visitors. However, I THINK that is for non EU visitors. This quote below is from Austrian Government website. ENTRY FROM WITHIN THE EU, THE SCHENGEN AREA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOMIndividuals wanting to enter Austria from a EU member state, the Schengen Area, or from Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican, or the United Kingdom must present a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular-biological SARS-CoV-2 test no older than four days at the time of entry (certificate in German / English).Individuals who cannot provide such a certificate will have to quarantine for 14 days at home (self-monitored) or at an appropriate accommodation which must not be left for the duration of the quarantine."
"Thanks all - lots of helpful stuff there, but not much that is positive. Looks like we may need to skip the festival this year and hope that the situation is better in 2021. Cheers."
I have emailed Austria Tourist Info office for clarification and will update with any reply
"some rather conflicting posts above. below is the current status and this states that those coming from the following countries within the eu or schengen, do not need to have a cert / test and do not need to quarantine. but, alas, for the op, that wont apply to them as they are from the uk and it is not included in the list. or am i misreading something?""Individuals who enter Austria coming from one of the following states and have their residence in Austria or one of the following states: Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, Germany (except Gütersloh County), Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania. Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprusdo not have to present the medical certificate and are not subject to a quarantine if they can credibly show that they were not present in any other state than Austria and the states listed above within the last 14 days."""
"#12 no, you are not misreading anything. It seems most EU nationals can enter Austria without a certificate - but not UK citizens. But I guess that's understandable, given the UK's relatively high level of infection (still)."
"You are right - there is no doubt that UK visitors will need the test. However, some sites (including Austria tourist website) suggest that even with negative test UK residents can only travel for essential purposes and that is what I am seeking to clarify. No issue entering if you are resident in most other EU countries."
that is not what you were saying in #9 ! that is why i made my post saying that there were conflicting views being posted !
Apologies just re-read #9. I should have typed that the Tourist Office states only essential travel for UK residents (not all visitors ?!).Still the same now - Tourist Office UK residents only for essential travel plus negative test. Austrian Government site seems to include the need for negative test but does not state only essential travel.Let us see Tourist Office response on my question.Last month Tourist Office website included Spanish residents when the Austrian Government still excluded them. Nothing is straightforward.
