"My family is thinking of staying in the Coachella Valley area between Xmas and New Years and are looking to do a vacation rental house. We have two young kids (age 8 and 5). We are driving down from the SF Bay Area and thought this would be a good choice as its within a day's drive and would likely be the warmest place in CA during that time. We want a place to socially distance during COVID, where we can enjoy the house and outdoor area (pool, hot tub, BBQ, firepit, etc.). We probably won't leave much during the week, except maybe a couple hikes during the day and takeout for dinner (would like some good choices nearby). We want a nice place, preferably under $1k/night. Hoping people can answer a few questions:-What city(ies) would be best to meet our needs? (looking at Palm Springs, Palm Desert and La Quinta but can look at others).-Are most pools heated year round?-Would it be warm enough to sit out by the pool during the daytime to sunbathe?-Is it safe to be in that area during COVID? I've heard cases in Riverside County are are pretty high."
"Palm Desert has some nice time share type units. You could socially distance in your unit, make your own food, or do take-out There will be some patio dining you could do that time of year too.For more on time shares in Palm Desert seehttps://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsList-Palm_â€¦We've stayed at the Marriott, Enclave, and Welk and enjoyed all three. It would make for a nice family vacation Of the three Enclave may be better due to the virus as they have a number of swimming pools - smaller, but not as large or as many people at each as at the other resorts."
"It gets very cold at night in the desert at the time of year. Keep in mind that the days are short then with sundown around 4:40 p.m. and sunrise around 6:40 a.m. expect cold mornings and cold evenings with very cold overnight temps.I live in Riverside County, in Beaumont, within about a half hour drive of PS. Some of the first Covid cases began in the desert area and the case count has been high. Actually, the first case was traced to a resident of San Diego who had traveled to the PS area to visit family. That contributed to cases in both areas. It was during a time when no one expected the U.S. cases to grow and before the Coachella Festival. One reason the Festival was cancelled was this case and more cases in the area right afterwards. Add to that fall and winter is prime flu season, so easier to catch any strain of flu including COVID-19.I don't know that it is actually possible to drive from Danville to PS in one day. And it is very possible you could hit a rain on your drive. Main places have restrooms closed, making pit stops very difficult.Edited: 10:20 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Many restaurants are not open and predicting who will be open/will survive is not possible. It is ""just"" warm enough to sit by a pool between about 11:30 and 1. December is a great time to be outside hiking, tennis, whatever.Until there is significant progress on controlling the virus, I am encouraging everyone (nicely) to stay home."
"Thanks everyone. It is possible to drive from the Bay Area to PS in a day. Its probably about an 8-9 hour drive each way, including stops. We'd probably time it to try to miss most of the LA traffic. Of course, if there is a snowstorm over the Grapevine and I-5 is closed, that could change our plans (we wouldn't know until a couple days beforehand). We do probably have to get creative with restroom stops, such as using rest areas. We actually are very vigilent about 1 - exposing our family to COVID and 2 - ensuring others don't catch it. As such, we wear masks religiously when out, do not go to large group settings and only do takeout for meals occasionally (first preference is DoorDash with curbside drop off). We do need to do a grocery run but try to stock up as much as we can the first time around. Honestly, I don't think my family is spreading the virus to others, but I can see why people are concerned about tourists in their communities in general."
Hypothetically let's say we finally get a grip on SARS-CoV-2 we will still need to SIP I would think to make sure thiS infectious agent is nowhere close to returning From the beginning they've stated Covid-19 during flu season is really going to rear it's ugly head( as if this bout isn't bad enough). If you must travel during a peak pandemic period I would look at homes near LA Quinta Resort. Great spot for never wanting to leave. Some rentals have access to the Resort. Gorgeous scenery. Modern homes are prevalent in PS and a great choice too. LA Quinta Resort under normal circumstances has holiday festivities.
"If you do this trip, watch the forecasts. We usually drive north to spend that week in SF and Marin, and snow on the Grapevine has caused us to reroute or go a day earlier or later than we had originally planned several times over the years. 101 to I-10 is an alternate route if I-5 closes, but it's a lot longer.If you rent a house, you'll need to ask about the pool heating. Some places will charge extra to heat it. Resort pools should be heated, but it doesn't hurt to ask them as well."
"Don't be surprised that there will be a nice fee to heat the pool also.Edited: 11:13 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Ah, I see we cross-posted and you're well aware of the snow issue. On restrooms, we drove back and forth last month, and all the rest stops were open as were the restrooms at the two gas stations we stopped at. We went to drive-thrus for food, so I can't speak to whether their bathrooms were available."
"Appreciate everyone's input and concern. I completely agree that people shouldn't be reckless about traveling and exposing others, in our efforts to control COVID. We have the same thing up here with people crowding Lake Tahoe en masse and creating significant COVID spread. I just know that here in the Bay Area during Xmas/New Years time, we're going to likely be mainly indoors as it tends to be cold/rainy. On other occasions, we'd do a staycation and visit museums and such, but not during COVID. So, trying to find the right balance of something to keep my family and young kids entertained, especially as we're struggling with the remote schooling environment. We actually did a house rental for a week up in Wine Country last month and it worked out great. We had a large, clean home with a pool and the kids loved it. We were able to SIP and not expose others/ourselves. So, we're looking for something similar but in an area where we can enjoy being outdoors more that time of the year. Seems like the desert cities are our best option, given that we don't want to get on an airplane or have a multi-day drive."
"I think you can totally do that drive in a full day, there is a way around the grapevine if weather is bad. It seems like a house rental would be a good and safe idea, at least as safe as you can be right now. I like the La Quinta or Palm Desert area. La Quinta might be a little quieter. The weather can be iffy, we went down a few years ago at New Years and it was freezing, snow on the mountains. I believe that was unusual though. Yes the nights and mornings will be cool.Enjoy your trip."
The La Quinta and Palm Desert communities have many gated golf communities. Most of these do not allow short term rentals. The country club I have a home in has a 30 day minimum and that is strictly enforced by us homeowners and the HOA.

">>Never had a month limit, however, once in Rancho Mirage we found that to be true. The owner at the last week emailed us about the key code, said if anyone asks, just say we are cousins to the owners.<<Wow."
