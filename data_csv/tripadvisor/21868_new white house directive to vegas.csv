"Paywall.Is this about the “ warning” that was posted last night?https:/…Edited: 9:36 am, July 23, 2020 "
"If so, it’s not a “ directive “. I’m not sure what it was..“ Dr. Deborah Birx, a leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, warned state and local leaders in a private phone call Wednesday that 11 major cities are seeing increases in the percentage of tests coming back positive for COVID-19 and should take “aggressive” steps to mitigate their outbreaks. The cities she identified were Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and St. Louis.The call was yet another private warning about the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreaks given to local officials but not the public at large. It came less than a week after the Center for Public Integrity revealed that the White House compiled a detailed report showing 18 states were in the “red zone” for coronavirus cases but did not release it publicly.“( article continues...)"
"Sounds just like more general blabber and BS from medical people that carries no weight. You really should not worry about getting there and having the casinos shut down.You should be worried about going and being around a bunch of your fellow citizens that can't seem to follow some simple rules to minimize spreading of the virus, and don't mind at all if you catch it. So, pay your money and take your chances ....."
“ Sounds just like more general blabber and BS from medical people that carries no weight.”Yup.I’m really not sure what the point was. They were telling the states that they had increasing levels. I’m pretty sure the states are already tracking this.
"And other medical ""blabbers"" are discussing why Las Vegas should stay open: https:/…"
"Fladoc, you do realize the ""Vegas mayor"" has no jurisdiction over the strip?Unless you are staying downtown. And if you are. Why?"
The way I read the article everybody seems to agree that the casinos are cesspools of COVID but nobody has the guts to shut them down.
"No, don't shut them down. They are contributing heavily to the herd immunity solution. They get the infection in that one place and then take it home and spread it liberally to the rest of the country.Only place better to do this is the many ""protesters"" in the major cities. They are actually helping to get this thing over with sooner."
"A Casino is an elective visit, no reason to shut it down, you don't have to go unless you want to! Keep them open as the cooks, servers, hotel workers, depend on our business to stay in business. Airplanes and casinos have state of the art HVAC systems with humidity settings and great air filtration! You have more of a chance catching Covid-19 at the grocery store or Home Depot! I've been on 5 trips including Cancun and haven't caught anything! And my summer home is Lake of the Ozarks! This virus is political!!!"
"I’m here now in Vegas and I must say, the casinos I’ are doing a great job. I see all the people complying as well. If your mask is down even if you’re smoking or drinking they tell you to pull it back up as soon as you take your swallow of your drink or cigarettes . It’s great to see them working so hard to try to keep this infection down and cleaning they are doing chips, chairs, etc.,just amazing.Edited: 6:50 pm, July 23, 2020 "
placebets - You are posting factually incorrect and dangerous information.
Oh I am ? Sorry...What is factually incorrect and dangerous ?
“ If your mask is down even if you’re smoking or drinking they tell you to pull it back up as soon as you take your swallow of your drink or cigarettes .”That’s not how cigarettes work!
"Regarding the concept of herd immunity, there is still more to be learned about how long the immunity lasts.https:/…NEJMc2025179"
"The really hard part in making this whole political stunt work is:How did they get 80,000 Brazilians to die to make the story sound realistic?Just wear your mask for the same reasons you use a proper septic system...Whether you believe in dysentery or not.Edited: 7:46 pm, July 23, 2020 "
