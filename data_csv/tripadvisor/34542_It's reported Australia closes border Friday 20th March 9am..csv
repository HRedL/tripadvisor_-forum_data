Just read this in the news.For a Non Australian Citizens.Ausralia will close Border.Friday 20th March 9am.Not sure as to when it will be lifted.Just a heads up to all thinking of heading this way.Regards Aussie Joh....!!
Its 9pm....
And about 24 hours after the announcement by the Prime Minister - things are slower over in Perth
"Aussie Joh- this was highlighted on this forum yesterday soon after the announcement by the PM:https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g25…And despite our isolation ( though some might argue not enough) I did read it yesterday on the news here in WA!Edited: 11:34 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Do you think is it possible to be lifted just before End of May?Edited: 12:44 am, March 20, 2020 "
"I doubt it Falentino. I would not be making any plans for before July, just me."
"No one can predict that. What I can say is that I have increasingly been hearing our politicians and journalists talking in terms of this lasting 6 months. So whilst a lifting by the end of May is not impossible, I would not be making any plans on that basis."
"Guys, regarding this barred matter.I have connecting flight via Sydney on 25th. I want to ask whether I can still board a plane to Syd and allowed to transfer to the 2nd plane without going through Syd immigration?I'm not a resident or citizen."
"Good Question Tom,Where are you flying in from and going to and who is the Airline ???. I am not sure , however it would need to be one PNR .Good Luck"
"Looking your other posts Tom- you are heading to NZ aren’t you? They are in lock down too with 14 day quarantine on arrival.Surely it’s time to postpone trip- seems you are travelling with elderly and kids. Not the time to be exposing family to risks.https:/…Edited: 2:39 am, March 20, 2020 "
"Sorry Tom you will have to stay home. You will not be allowed to enter NZ. Like so many of us whose travel plans are now cancelled, you will need to seek refunds or vouchers if possible."
"Tom, surely you cannot be serious about even thinking about going to NZ now.Even if you can make it there, you will spend all of your 2 weeks in isolation. Then how would you get back home? Just leave it for another time."
As Fedup stated Tom is staying home whether he likes it or not. NZ closed their borders before Aus.
Its amazing how many people still don't get it.But I suppose that is why governments must take such a hard stand.
"Hello all, While I understand how you guys are so forward and in front of us here in Perth WA.I beleive your smarter as well....apparently.It was for the reason that you were still fielding questions about coming to OZ that I put it up as I did not find a post heading that was direct enough.I thought this one may do it but then again the last enquiry has me wondering.Carry on with the message as best you can...sorry we're shut...!!Good luck to allWe're all in it together now wether we like it or not.Sneeze into your elbow....!!Scough......Oh I mean cough at No one....!!Regards Aussie Joh....!!Edited: 6:26 am, March 20, 2020 "
"Thanks guys for the concern,Actually I arrived in NZ on 12 ,the border was closed on 15 and I managed to avoid the quarantine order. Also just got information that ozy was closed today so that's why I try to find out how to sort this. My original flight was from chc-syd-jkt eith Qantas on 26.If I can't board the flight to sydney then I'll try to find another way.Edited: 6:44 am, March 20, 2020 "
"So you’re trying to get home Tom?I’d try to do that sooner than May, a lot sooner. It’s not just the travel bans you need to worry about. Some flights will run for a short while to get Australians and Kiwis home. After that there isn’t going to. E a demand for flights at all, so the airlines will stop flying.I don’t know if a sterile Airlie transfer who be excluded from the ban or not.If you wait until May 25th, I think hiull be staying in NZ indefinitely. Just you opinion."

"I am still holding onto the the rather-optimistic / naiive hope of the situation improving and enabling me to visit Australia in mid-July. I obviously would not book anything until things change but that could take some several long weeks at best. I am more than willing to travel spontaenously (and suffer the blow of the high costs..), but let's say the coast clears in July - I'm afraid that is not going to give me enough time to get a visitor's visa. Do you know if the current travel ban also applies to visa procedures?Until then, let us all stay safe at home!"
The advice is to always get your visa before booking flights - apply now and have it ready for travel when it starts again.https:/…visa-finder
Logic would suggest that why issue a visa when the border is closed or the visa holder might lay claim to some kind of legal rights. I'm pretty sure all current visa (if you are outside the country) are suspended for now and no new visas are being processed until a definitive end date of border closure is announced.
Good luck everyone. See you on the other side.
"Yes, good luck everyone. Take care. Especially those with age and health risk factors. :-)"
Any one with information and willing to help will be MOST appreciated. My wife and I have a two week trip paid for to Australia (Sydney) at the end of August 2020. Can't get a straight answer if we will be quarantined upon arrival or if our hotel (The IBis) will be open. Anyone that might enlighten us will be a hero. Thanks in advance.
Borders are still closed and won’t likely be opened by the end of August. Only citizens and residents are allowed entry. You might like to check your cancellation policies.
"We were planning to visit Australia and New Zealand for the month of October. Unfortunately, we are assuming that the border will remain closed, especially to those of us who live in the US. Right now, we have to play the game to wait for our flights to cancel-then we will move forward. We are crushed...as most tourists, we have planned this trip for years. We definitely will reschedule...but not sure when, and it is very frustrating.Stay safe everyone...look forward to seeing you someday!"
"KT, you won't get a straight answer here either because no-one on TA has a crystal ball that actually works.To put it another way, you are asking about a situation that is in 3 months' time in the circumstance where the Govt has not at any stage placed a time limit on the quarantine measure or, more importantly for you, the closure of the border to tourists from outside Australia, nor has it given any indication of when it might lift either or both those measures.As a matter of personal opinion, I would think it unlikely you will be allowed to set foot in Australia for quite some time given the experience of the USA with COVID."
"I also have an August 2020 trip planned to Sydney. Information is conflicting and I can get clear answers from anyone. I've been looking at the following websitehttps://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/coronavirus-australia-when-stage-one-restrictions-will-lift/news-story/9598ff0b72d73b68db1b532fbb33d323 and if anyone knows a better one, please help us. Basically, I need to know if my wife and I will be quarantined upon arrival for 14 days and will the hotel (the IBIS) be open for business? If anyone can help us, we would be most appreciative."
"Kom, pro tip. Don’t try and get your news from News Ltd or Fox. My understanding is that the borders are closed to anyone who is not Australian, and probably will be for some time. The chances that someone from the US will be allowed into Australia, will not happen for a long time."
"Until you see an official statement from the Australian government, assume that the borders will remain closed. Do not expect to travel here at any time this year."
"This is the ""official"" website with all the actual government information minus far right media spin ... there is no mention of when the borders will re-open and when the quarantine process will end. https:/…travel-to-australiaAs stated by Peter ... no one can answer these questions yet ... not even the government has a date. Most Australians assume the borders won't open until next year sometime ... although they may open to New Zealanders. The USA is one of the worlds hot spots ... I doubt US citizens will have access without some sort of testing for some time."
"The borders between some Australian states might still be closed until September. I would be very surprised if our external borders are open this year, except maybe between Australia and NZ."
You forgot to mention that we have a first class nut and coward for a president. It will be a long time before we live his mantra down for sure.
"Yes Post #36. It is very sad that the man is still in the job, it appears that sometime ago he has had mental break down. So show him some pity. At one time people thought George Bush Jr was a bit dumb. He now looks like a very smart man.Good Luck and we look forward to welcoming you one day"
"Now that was a truly kind response. It's hard to remember when he aggravates most Americans. Certainly hope for a change in the coming years. It's a shame that Joe Biden appears to be the alternative. It's hard for me to get fired up at such a weak choice. Not to say that I won't vote for him because it would be very difficult to do a worse job than Trump. I lived in another country in the late 80's and while there almost all of my friends were Australians. They seemed to take themselves a lot less seriously and had the ability to have fun in almost any situation. I would like to have trait in my own personality. I spend too much time thinking things like; ""I wonder what this person or that person might think of me."" The Australians that I met certainly did not share that trait."
"Oh and I need to mention that Trump is exactly 14 days older than me so take it easy on the mental breakdown comments. My wife, who is a lot younger than me, reminds me of my ""Pre-Alzheimer's"" all the time when she wants to win arguments. She likes to say that yes...""You are truly the head of our household. No doubts at all. But, I am the neck of the household and I can turn the head any way I want."" Unquote."
"People of any age can have mental melt down ,age has little to do with it. The office of the President is not easy to preform and my opinion is that he is now showing signs that the task is well above his current capacity.Good Luck"
"That's very clever KommandantTampa :-)#37 ""Good Luck and we look forward to welcoming you one day""+1"
"Hi,IME nearly all politicians have delusions of adequacy.But can you think of a worse job ? By definition the people attracted to politics are not the sort of people you would want running a chook raffle let alone a country.Cheers,"
"Being that the Donald is approximately the same age as myself, when he began his Presidential campaign I questioned why anyone at that stage in their life would be interested in such a position. You will have to trust me when I say that I would NEVER under any conditions give the slightest consideration to accepting a position such as the one the Donald finds himself in . I have been in relative positions of power over other people and to tell the truth, I did not like it. Think of the Donald's life prior to the Presidency...He had money, a growing family, interesting opportunities everywhere he looked, and no one to criticize his actions or non-actions. I like to think of myself as one with better than average capabilities, but also one that judges the output that I would have to put out versus the rewards I might receive from whatever the challenge was before me. I also have a younger and pretty wife, I have a better than average income, and I am free to come and go as I please. I have traveled to over 100 countries and counting with no signs of fatigue. Compare that to the Donald who other than a larger bank balance (so he says anyway) he hasn't done anything that interests me at all. I am also considerably thinner than the Donald on any given day:-). There should be a bailout clause whereby a cade such as the Donald could pull the veritable ripcord and eject himself back to his previous unencumbered life. As his life stands now if he doesn't get re-elected, he will be chased from one end of the country and the world to the other by people that want to get even with him for the rest of his life. I, instead might be daunted by my questionable upcoming Australia trip, but I will come out the other end unscathed. I will chase the Kangaroos, drink lots of Australian beer and yes, you may quote me on my life's goals. Nope; no envy on my part at all."
"KommandantTampa, you asked the same question at #30 as you did at #26. In between I sought to answer it, so let me express it another way. But first, in terms of protocol on TA it is not good form to tack on a question to someone else's. It is preferable to start your own post. That way nobody gets confused as to matching answers with questions.Right now, you are focusing on whether Australia will still be imposing 14-day quarantine on arrivals in late August. The question is irrelevant because it assumes you will be allowed to enter Australia, and right now, if your only reason for coming is for a holiday and you are not an Australian citizen, permanent resident, or a family member of such a person, you are not allowed to come here. There are exceptions but reasons such as you have a non-cancellable flight or that you have the required visa do not qualify.Some have commented you won't be allowed to enter Australia this year and some have commented you might be. Those are just personal opinions. To get the facts, monitor this Government site for updates on when you will be allowed to come to Australia: https:/…coming-australia"
Thank you. Tacky tacky me.
