"I’ve been researching everywhere and can’t find anyone who will get results within 72 hours for the flight requirements. Everywell has a home test that gives results within 72 hours of receiving it, but that would be over 72 hours from when it’s taken. So frustrating."
Are you looking for a place where you live? Are you going to be flying through SFO or LAX or stopping there for a few days to test? If you need it where you live where is it that you are flying out of? That may help us determine if we have any recommendations for you.
"Chris-I am in the same boat. I am being tested here in Abq on Suday. I hope to have the tests results back in 48 or before we leave ( I have a friend who got tested same facility and got them back in 48)In fact, we plan on going to LAX that Wednesday even if we dont have the results and if no results fly back home and redo all my trip plans for next summer.I am not getting too excited for my trip as we have to:1) all 3 of us test negative2)get the results within the timeframe to fly outI am actually in a sour mood as I have zero control over this. I hate it immensly."
"In LA there is definitely options. Even for the free tests most of my friends are getting results back in 48hrs. But there's a clinic connected to Air Tahiti Nui that they recommend on their website that seems to be working with the airline. I recently got Covid tested for a job I did and got results back in 24hrs, but had to pay to have expedited. But for sure if you're going through LA there are options. But i know it's stressful!"
"It’s a stressful time guys. No way to start a vacation! We got the test done and the results back in 3 hours which is great but I still don’t know if :1) if it matters that the results are in English when we are departing from France - I’m hoping air Tahiti Nui staff are bilingual!! 2) if we were even allowed to get the test done in London when we’re departing from France eventhough we did do it in the 72 hour time frame and with the UK/France time difference factored in. 3) if you non French nationals can go to French territories via France.Leave for France tomorrow and and Tahiti on Thursday and will just have to hope for the best but I’m feeling stressed, tired and sick! :-("
I hope all goes well for you. We live in Scotland and currently booked to fly to Tahiti from LA end of September. Thinking we might have to change to fly from Paris but getting stressed thinking about the test. Can’t find anywhere in Scotland you can get a test like you did in London. We can order one from London but will then have to post back .
Can I also ask do you need a certificate from a doctor as well as the test result ?
"I was told you can use the electronic version of showing you tested negative. Hopefully, if we get the test results back prior to us leaving, we are going to print them out.Good luck!"
"Is it even worth it to go? (For your stress levels and enjoyment alone, not even counting the virus).I'm not saying don't go, but I go over to the Hawaii forum and its just arguing and complaining. The Bahamas just closed their borders and people are scrambling and stuck. Hell you can't can even fly into NY/NJ/CT without a 14 day quarantine. This isn't what a vacation should be.Canceling both my France and Hawaii trip sucked initially, but lifted that cloud of anxiety. A couple a weekend local trips have helped."
"Even I, the eternal optimist, am getting a little crabby over this. I specifically booked my hotel RIGHT NEXT to the Urgent Clinic that ATN was partnered with, so I could just walk over and take my test upon landing. Now I may have to get a rental car to drive to the other location the next day since they're not open 24/7. Part of me is thinking to just go to the Rapid clinic anyways, try my luck there, then go to the new one first thing in the morning. What a kerfluckle this has been.....11 more days...."
Cupcake - have you booked your test at the Reliant Urgent care clinic at LAX yet? I was trying to book it online and there isnt any dates available for the air tahiti flight clearance option...
22kauai - did you do your kaiser test in LA or norcal?
"Hi Jyotsna!I was unable to. So I called them and they said I could do a walk in, no problem. This was last Thursday though. I think I'll call tomorrow and hear them out. If they say anything new/different, I'll report back. In the meantime, I'm going to stress the importance of this test and fast results to my doctor. Plan B is to find more test sites in LA that provide 48 hr results. Sigh."
This place is not close LAX at all... but I got my results back in less than 24hrs and they have plenty of appointment times available. Also cheaper than the place recommended by Tahiti Nui. So may be a backup option for some folks!https://www.genxlaboratories.com/
Ok thanks cupcake - I look forward to hearing from you. Good luck! Wanderlust thanks for that back up option - was it an RT PCR type test?
Adding to the list....Thanks Wanderlust!!
I got my test last week in Riverside. I got test because I was running a slight fever. I’m living vicariously though all of you. We’ve been many times but don’t have plans to return yet but hope it’s in our future. I’m looking forward to hearing all your adventures. Right now I’m hoping we get to Kaua’i at end of September. Wish me luck!
"What is an RT PCP type? It was definitely the one where a nurse shoves a giant cue-tip up BOTH nostrils... They do antibody testing as well... So I imagine it's the type that is needed for Tahiti, but if you find out otherwise please let me know!"
Yes I think the nasal swab is the RT PCR one ( that’s the one Tahiti accepts ) .
I am trying to stay positive. Bahamas shutting out Americans kind of freaked me out. Going to FP is the only thing I really have to look forward to this summer. Not to mention all the money that I have already paid since I first booked last September.I read on the Bora Bora FB page that the Reliant Clinic that ATN was working with is no longer working with them. I read ATN now has a new clinic people are supposed to go to.
"Cupcake-I hear you. Our dilemma is take the test here which is free and risk not getting it back within 3 days or go to LAX early, get the covid test and pay extra as well as a hotel stay etc.We are going to roll the dice with our testing here. In fact, we plan to fly to LA and will wait to get the results even if we dont have them when leaving Abq.Its out of our control which it is the most challenging thing about the trip.Staying optimistic....."
"Hey Andrew,Sounds like you have a plan in place. Good. At this point I'm done with stressing. Reliant has 15 min tests on their site now, and these tests are acceptable for travel purposes. The price has increased to almost $200 which is probably why they decided to break with ATN....they know folks (like me) want to travel and will pay the money to do so. I'm about to book it now and wash my hands of the whole situation until I fly to Tahiti. My plan still remains to get tested for free with Kaiser next Wednesday morning, fly to LA that afternoon, then go test at Reliant once I land. Between the 2 of them I should get a result back within 72 hrs. If I dont, then I guess it's not meant for me to go to Tahiti....which means I'll change my flight info and head on down to Mexico since I'll be in the area. At least I'll be packed appropriately....Semper Gumby LOL"
Where are you ? In SF we have 15 minute tests. Mine is scheduled day before I fly
Jessica - where in SF are you doing the rapid test ? Is it a PCR test and is it acceptable for travel ? I live in the Bay Area and leave in 2 weeks..Cupcake - if you do the reliant 15 min test please let us know how it goes!
I’m near San Francisco. Where are you able to get a test with results in 15 minutes here?
"OK I just spoke to Reliant and they are telling me that the 15 minute test is not going to be acceptable to Air Tahiti Nui. I wanted to pass this info on.I got a number for an Eve for more info and of course she doesnt answer her phone and her voicemail is full.With my travels, that includes bribing govnt officials to expedite visa extensions, I have never encountered such clusterf@#$% in my life. LMAO."
"Wow, they’re making it impossible to go to Tahiti. Do you know what kind of test they will accept? Sounds like you can get this one back in 72 hours. https:/…"
You nailed it.
"Jessica - Yes, where are you getting a 15 minute PCR Covid Test near San Francisco?Thanks, Sue"
"Hi Chris,Urgent care (dignity) has 15 minute tests. They are nasal swabs, but now I’m panicking that they may not be PCR. I did another test in SF and came back in 24 hours, but wasn’t PCR (I called them)."
Read the website info:https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/
"DGK, exactly.We were booked for Moorea, too,end of Aug, however, decided to postpone based on so many unknowns. Consider these prior to making a decision: 1) What if the 72 hr prior to departure test results are delayed? (If you don’t have any medical reason, can you even get one depending on where you live? There are already shortages due to increased testing from mainland spikes & reports of results coming back in 19-12 days)2) What if you get a positive self-test at 4 days into your stay? Health officials state that 40% of positive cases are asymptomatic so transmission is always a possibility regardless of the precautions that you take. It would be a nightmare (not to mention expensive) to be forced to quarantine there or even worse to become ill considering the extreme shortage of resources. I'm an RN, having medical staff that is experienced in caring for very sick covid patients is crucial, they have had so few cases and would lack that aspect. There’s a good video of the self-test procedure but no info on how quickly those results come back or precisely what they do next if positive, other than admission into a designated quarantine facility. 3) Have travel insurance that specifically covers Covid related expenses (most do not cover pandemics) or be able to assume all financial responsibility, including medical evacuation if need be.4) At any given time, the Tahiti govt could lockdown if they get a surge in cases, which would leave you in a real bind. 5) Depending on the situation in your home state, you might have to do quarantine upon your return."
"Chris E, it's on their website:https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/"
"Jessica - I think you are taking your Covid test at Stanford too, right? If so, I was just talking to them about getting our 16 year olds results (there are privacy issues with 16 year olds AND they are too young to have a MYHealth account so we are trying to work around it)But he just told me they are seeing quicker than expected turn around time on Negative tests. He was very excited about this. He said positives could take longer. He also said they are bringing in another big machine before I take our test in 8 days so it should be even quicker. So great news!!"
"@Suel3754, thanks for the update! This is great to hear. We're booked for testing at Stanford too :finger-crossed:"
Suel3754 It is great news for us too. I haven't made an appointment yet. I am going to make an appointment for my all family.
"@SueI3754 do let us know how it all works out for you. I am from San Jose also but not going until November. Lord knows what will happen between now and then but keeping fingers crossed. Already have had two cancelled trips this year (for good reason) but this one I will lose money on and really need the escape. Feel more comfortable knowing everyone heading there has to have a negative test, although no real guarantee, it helps with the concern. I was there late last year for my 50th and man am I glad I got that trip in before this all went down. Needless to say, we were were so enamored we booked again almost immediately."
"Yes Sue, in part thanks to you I’m getting it at Stanford. So happy and grateful. Thanks for the tip. Fingers crossed!"
Anyone on the forum leaving from Los Angeles on a Sunday evening flight? Just wondering how fast your test results came back. Did you go on Thursday and get them back on time? If so where in the Los Angeles area did you go. Thanks
Did your test to return in 72 hours?‘s I live in San Diego and I need to find a spot that is 720 hours
Same situation for me - testing in San Diego/LAX area is fine.
Briana - I definitely will report how testing goes. We are scheduled next Saturday at exactly 72 hours prior to our flight. I so need this get away. We canceled once already and I will lose some money this time on one of the prepaid hotels and it is a lot of money. Already lost the money on one Air Tahiti interisland flight that we don’t need now with our reworked trip itinerary. I am just going to keep thinking positive and keep moving forward as if it will all work out! I have been keeping up with the people who are already over there and they said it has been fantastic since arriving!
"@Suel3754 Could you say which Stanford health in the Bay Area you are going to? I am having mine with Kaiser in SF, and they are saying less than 4 days for results, but that's not really helpful. I also confirmed with Tahiti Tourism that if my flight is on a Thursday I can get my test done on Monday i.e. it's not strictly 72 hours but rather 3 days before, so that buys a little more time. Good luck in catching your flight!"
"WanderingWomble - You live in London? I think you have to get your test in your home country before they let you fly, don't you?"
"Suel3754 - thanks for the response - no, I am currently in San Francisco (I need to update my profile!). I had a booking with Color labs in SF which is free and fast but this isn't a PCR test, and Kaiser, which is a PCR. I don't think Kaiser are going to have the results in time so looking for other options and wondering which Stanford Healthcare is doing this (I would plan to join them just to get this done). Thanks again!"
"WanderingWomble - We are having ours done in Palo Alto. Call Stanford at 650-736-5211, Option #1Tell them you need a test for travel. Ours is booked for exactly 72 hours before our flight.My only worry now is what will the wording be on the Results we get back in our MyHealth portal? What if it doesn't say PCR-RT anywhere? I know that is the test that Stanford uses and can find articles that state that is what they use but what if results don't say it??I know we have to print our results out from our portal as well (even though I have heard ATN is accepting results shown right on people's phone at check in). I do not know how United will handle it (that is who I am flying) so I would rather be safe than sorry and have my results printed and on my phone App.Good luck to you!!Sue"
Thanks Sue. Is Stanford guaranteeing results in 72 hours?
"I just called Stanford and they said the paperwork you’ll get does state it’s a PCR test. Unfortunately for me, they only had one appt the day I need it, and I need two appts for me and my husband. So I guess I’ll be going with the home test and crossing my fingers."
"Does anybody have good suggestions for testing in Southern California. San Diego, LA, Orange county.thank you."
Anyone in Los Angeles go to Good Life Medical Services the place Air Tahiti Nui recommended? If so how fast did you get your results. I’m on a Sunday flight and concerned that the labs aren’t open on the weekend and need my results by Sunday. I’ll go and get the test on Thursday and pay for the expedited service. Crossing my fingers and toes!!
I’m going to try the Good Life medical services in West Hollywood. It’s the one Air Tahiti Nui recommended. What date do you leave?

Hi Chris - I just booked my appointment with Stanford in early September. They don’t guarantee anything unfortunately. Currently the estimate is 3-4 days due to recent spikes in cases. Can only hope things get better in the next month and their testing capacity goes up!
For Los Angeles passengers my going to look into this place https:/…
"Chris- Oh no, they only had one testing time left the day you need your test? That is a bummer. Thank you so much for asking if the results say PCR on them! That is reassuring that they do!! When do you need your test taken? I hope everything works out for you!Sue"
Ray - we take our tests at Stanford this Saturday. I will report back how quickly we get our results!!Fingerscrossed!Sue
Michelle W - Just a heads up on this website you linked. it says they offer Rapid PCR which a few people on this forum have said they got denied boarding for having the word “rapid” in their results. I Would double check they can give you results without that verbiage. Good luck!
"Is the COVID PCR test you perform acceptable prior to a flight?Yes! We are using a CLIA certified high complexity molecular lab that has been granted an EUA by the FDA and meets all the requirements to be able to travel at the airport. This is the same as nucleic acid test NAT test. Most airlines are requiring that you have your test performed within 72 hours of your flight. We are performing these services to those who require a clearance prior to travel on an airplane. Our lab will directly send you the result via email once released. You will usually receive your results within 24 to 48 hours of your test but we ask that you email us letting us know that you have a flight scheduled if you have not received it due to email errors so we make sure you have no issues with your travel.This is on the website. When I spoke to a ATN representative she said a passenger went to Beverly Hills and got the results in time. I’m assuming this is the place as on Yelp they posted the situation.Edited: 1:23 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"Michelle - You are right, they do not have the word ""rapid"" on their test results I did find out by calling and also speaking with a bunch of actual people who were tested here. IMO - I think Its just misworded on the website saying rapid cos they do give fast results but its the regular RT PCR test. I also got a copy of how their test results would look and it perfectly says Sars COV 2 Covid 19 RT PCR and no ""rapid"""" anywhere on the results. Several people have already used them for many international flights and have successfully boarded. I reached out to a couple of them who left this clinic reviews on yelp too and they were kind enough to tell me how fast they got their results and also share a screenshot of how their test results looked."
That's great news! I appreciate you guys doing all this additional leg-work. I will definitely add this clinic to my list! I just got concerned when I saw the word rapid on the website and didn't want anyone to be denied boarding!
Anybody did the Everlywell Covid-19 at-home test? It says results are provided within 72hrs so considering this as an option...
I’m feeling good about about the place in Beverly Hills. Thanks to those who researched it. I actually called them also and they seem legit. But did anyone use the place suggested by Tahiti Nui? Any feed back on them?
"If anyone uses the Beverly Hills clinic for results, please post your experience and if it is accepted. Thanks!"
Anybody got tested through Kaiser?
For future travelers who havent booked their tests yet FYI - Air Tahiti Nui just updated their website to say that they Abbott ID now molecular test (which gives results in 15 minutes) is now being accepted! https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/french-po…Im not sure about United though...I know that this test is being offered by Go Health by Dignity Health and they have several locations all over.
Yeah same here! I still think its safer to take the RT PCR test for now especially cos Tahiti Tourism hasnt updated anything yet. On their website it still says RT PCR only.Michelle - are you doing your test at the Bev Hills location?
"I know when I had asked a local clinic about their test, they claimed their Abbott ID NOW one was PCR, but not sure if that is true or not. I've seen mixed things online some saying it is and others just comparing it to PCR tests."
Yes I am
Me too! Sending you a PM ..
"Abbott ID NOW uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification, which is not PCR.Now I see ATN accepts tests labeled PCR and RT-PCR. As every SARS-CoV-2 PCR test is a RT-PCR test, this appears to be a step in the right direction."
"Suel3754 - thanks so much for all the info (and the moral support!) It looks like Stanford will put PCR on the test, so you will hopefully be good to go. I also emailed TahitiTourisme who are seem to be the official tourism body for French Polynesia. They actually told me there will probably be new guidance out on Friday for people leaving in the next two weeks. They didn't say what this was but keep an eye out. Best of luck to you and everyone on this forum!"
"So just got the Abbott rapid test (negative, yay!) but it says nothing about PCR. I know ATN says it is fine, but feel a bit better getting a PCR . Has anyone boarded with Abbott rapid test yet?"
Jessica call ATN and email it to them. My reliant test was similar. They cleared it day before we flew out.
"Hi Andrew, I’m flying United. They don’t say anything about the policy - and didn’t seem to know when I called"
"Hi, Where can you get the Abbott test, do you need to pre-book and how much does it cost.thank you."
"Hello pclark2,We live in the central valley and couldn't find anywhere that does the newer Abbott ID now test. What is the name and location of the clinic you called?Our flight leaves next Saturday and there is nothing that is quicker than three days return and that is too close. We need something fast.Thanks!Steve and StacyFresno, Ca"
Hi all. I did test with dignity go health and was covered by insurance
Thanks Jessica! They have the Abbott tests and so far they're the closest place to Fresno we've been able to find. My wife and I can breath easier now as we have some hope.
Of course. Hope that helps. Let me know how it goes :)
"Jessica, did you have to say you had symptoms or were exposed? Or do they accept to test for travel?Thanks!"
"YAAAAAYUUUUUSSSS I DID IT!!!! *Fist pump*I tested negative!!! I tested at Reliant Urgent Care, LAX location last night at 825 pm. Just received my test result (545 pm Thursday). SO EXCITED. Note, this test is painful, but would do it again 15 times over back to back if necessary."
Are they accepting oral swab tests? I have 2 kids nervous about have something stuck up their noses.
"Hi Jessica - please let us know if United accepts the Abbott rapid test. We are flying on United as well in a month — currently we have appointments with Stanford 3 days in advance, but they told us expected test result is 3-4 days which is cutting it too close for my comfort! Would definitely rather go with the rapid test option if United accepts it. Thanks!!"
"Sure Ray! But I’m doing BOTH the Stanford test and the rapid test :) if Stanford one comes in on time I’llUse that, since I am more confident with that one. Rapid test just wasn’t that descriptive"
Oh that’s a great idea! We will do the same :)Test me as many times as you want as long as I can get on the plane!! Haha
Travel for life couple- I was honest about why I wanted the test :) no symptoms needed
"Cupcake ~ YAY, wow, that was a quick turnaround. Less than 24 hours!! Did you test in LA? When do you fly?Hope we can grab that social distance drink in the pool on the 12th.Have a fantastic time!!!Sue"
Hey Suel!It really WAS quick. I was shocked that it came back in under 24 hours. I tested in LA at their LAX location. I fly tomorrow (Saturday); I've only left my room for food and to print my results/ ETIS paperwork. I'm excited! I will definitely let you know where I am so we can have a celebratory social distancing drink LOL
Please post some pictures on the Facebook Bora Bora page so I can live vicariously through you until we can get there on Tuesday!!!Have the time of your life! So happy for you!!!!Safe travels!!
"So excited for you Cupcake! Safe travels tomorrow and I second what Sue said, please post photos! More importantly, have an amazing time!"
"Sue and Elle, thanks soooo much. I legit teared up when both results came back. It's finally happening! The stress, the changes, the research and planning are about to become REAL. I am so happy. I will definitely post some pics in the group :-) Safe travels to you both, and every one who is making this journey. Cheers!!!!"
Does any one know the protocol with the test 4 days after arrival?
"""It’s a stressful time guys. No way to start a vacation!""If you need a test and need to find the hassle of getting one then no way would I take a vacation of this magnitude right now."
Here are the instructions posted on Tahiti Tourisme:https:/…A0_partir_du_15_juillet_2020_VF.pdfhttps:/…A0_partir_du_15_juillet_FR_ANG_VF.pdf
Thats not what Michael Jordan would say. He would find a way to overcome.
"An unrelated question to COVID testing, does anyone have a recommendation about the following1. Should we change currency in USA or at FAA airport? Which gives better rates?2. Change to XPF or euro?3. Any particular credit card recommended for use in Tahiti? for e.g., am ex, visa etc"
Hi! Did anyone use genxlabs in LA? My husband and I fly to Tahiti on August 14th and are looking for the best option as well. Thanks!
"Apmotel,I'm going to exchange a small amount at the airport. Enough to get me a taxi and some food. I'm headed to the kiosk now for XPF, if they have it.I heard Visa is the safest bet to use there, credit and debit cards.When I get to Papeete, I'll find an ATM and take out more money there; better rates at an ATM vs Currency Exchange.Edited: 11:35 pm, August 01, 2020 "
Hi everyone. Just found out United requires RT-PCR so the rapid tests won’t be valid. Hope we all get there safely and healthy
"It looks like ATN has removed mentions of ""rapid"" or ""abbott id now"" tests. So no more 15min tests?"
"Given there has been a case reported on the Paul Gauguin today, I am sure they will not be moving to the Rapid test anytime soon. I am really hoping FO does not shirt down again :-("
Sue- how did stanford test go. I’m doing it tomorrow. Please keep us updated about the results :)Also does anyone know if they are keeping the cruise ship people on it or letting them off? Can’t believe they allowed a cruise :( Those things are Petri dishes
Thanks for the information. I read that exchanging at USA banks get soy less. I read that exchanging $$ at FAA airport gives better rates. Is this true?Would you suggest FAA airport or at Papete ATM?Thanks
"For those in Southern California, we tested at Myconcierge. 225$ per test (RT PCR). We got results in 24 hrs."
Apmotel- I’m getting my test there on Tuesday ! Thanks for sharing ...
jyostna-great
Jyostna-how are you planning to deal with currency exchange? Obtain from USA bank or change in FAA or pappetee ATM?
"I plan to do it in PPT. Not sure if an ATM or at a money exchange, do you know if one or the other is recommended in terms of a better rate ?"
"Jessica - Hi, we took our test at Stanford Saturday at approximately 2pm. One of our daughters and I got our results last night at 7:15pm (29 hours after taking test). I was kind of shocked we got them back on a Sunday because so many people were saying the labs don't work on the weekend but obviously they do. My husband and other daughter did not get them last night. They are both still sleeping but I will ask them to check first thing.The only thing now is that the form does not use the term RT-PCR. It says: ""SARS-CoV-2 , the COVID-19 virus was NOT detected in your nasopharyngeal sample""Now I am worried about that but will be calling Stanford and United today. I am grateful that we received at least 2 results last night so I have enough time to make calls instead of receiving them all late tonight.Wish me luck!!!"
Sue - congrats!! Glad to hear you got 2 results back so quickly. Sounds like the other 2 should soon follow.Please do keep us posted on what United says. I can’t imagine them turning down test results from Stanford... that’s as legit as it gets and not like Stanford offers any other kind of tests.
"I am in San Francisco Bay Area. Does anyone know where I can get a test and get the results back within 72 hours? How much would it cost since it is not a medical issue and I presume Insurance won't cover? Tahiti, Dubai, even some US states require a test before you get on the plane."
Sue- juts did the Stanford one ten minutes ago. So nervous that if doesn’t say RT-PCR! Please let me know what you hear. I’ll try United too
"Hello All,I just made the trip we’ve all been planning and things went fairly smoothly. LAX to PPT on 8/2/2020.I tested at the Beverly Hills testing site mentioned in this forum. It is the accurate Covid test needed for flying to FP. Test results read: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RT-PCR/ SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) PCR.Results arrive in 24-48 hours via email.Test results were reviewed at LAX by ATN staff. They have a separate table set up to analyze your results to make sure they comply with the current testing requirements, then you proceed to the check in counter to check bags/etc. I did see a few people turned away for the wrong testing date or type of test.Feel free to message with any questions.Happy and Safe Travels:)"
Yay happy to hear that Missy ! Thanks for updating . I have my test at the same clinic tomorrow morning :). Glad to hear it all went well. Enjoy your trip.

"Hi everybody - I think we are finally all set for our flight tomorrow at 1:20pm. I will report back if we have any issues.So it took 29 hours to get out results for my youngest daughter and I and 34 hours for our other daughter and 40 hours for my husband (and this was all tested on the weekend.I called today about how our test read (not saying RT-PCR although that was definitely the test they gave us) and after a bit of being connected to different people at Stanford, they got a doctor to send us a letter to our MyHealth Portal that said that we took the RT-PCR test and our results were negative. So I have printed EVERYTHING out to bring. We did the ETIS forms and printed our scan code to bring too. I just need to finish/rework my suitcase in the morning. I am finally starting to feel confident that we will indeed get on the plane and have paid for our tours and private transportation in Bora Bora (I had told them I wanted to wait until our Covid test/results were settled.I will be ordering a champagne (if they are serving that tomorrow) to celebrate and finally calm down. This has been very stressful but I know it will be worth it!!Good luck to everyone!!Sue"
"Good luck and smooth travels tomorrow Sue! We also fly tomorrow, but will be flying Air Tahiti Nui out of LAX. Crossing my fingers that everything will go smoothly on our end as well, it's been a pretty stressful couple of weeks trying to figure out the testing options! I'll also report back on our end! Thank you to everyone who has been sharing information and cheering each other on."
Good luck Sue and to anyone else on the first UA flight tomorrow. I'll be watching the sky tomorrow night from PPT to see the plane lands. I'm excited for you guys!
We are on board waiting to depart. 31 min late. They keep announcing that there are problems with some hopeful passengers documents. Thankfully not us!! I ungraded to Polaris seats so it will be a comfy flight. I am exhausted. It has been quite the feat to get to this place! Ready to relax and enjoy!! They check your documents twice. They won’t let you get Boarding Docs at home. They check you at The United counter before security and again at the Gate. Hoping to take off soon
Yay!!!! I upgraded too :) and so happy it worked
"Sue,I hope that you are in the skies now and unable to answer this but sometime in the next while can you tell me if 1) you were able to specify/ask if they'd do the PCR test at Stanford? 2) My flight is also on a Tuesday. Any clue what the hours are on the weekend at Stanford?Ia orana and mauruuru."
"Hello everyone, Just wanted to let you know I got my Stanford test back (25 hours after the test). Negative, yay!Also, it DOES say RT-PCR on the print out. Also the process was easy and the people were super nice. So excited. Hope to celebrate and cheers some of you soon"
Congrats Sue!! So glad to hear and hope you have a great vacation!
Yay Jessica ! So glad you went to Stanford finally :) have a great trip .
So has anyone boarded a flight out of the US without the words RT-PCR on the test results?
Congrats Sue! the plane has landed yay! you must be so excited and ready to relax :D
"So, has anyone tried using the Abbott or other rapid test for boarding with United?"
"Hello:Can someone summarize where to get the RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 in either San Francisco or Los Angeles with results within 24/48 hours (if you can mention prices that's great)? There is so many messages on the thread, I'm lost. Any feedback from the official recommendation of ATN: Goodlife Medical Services?People mentioned Stanford, do you have the exact website by any chance?Good luck everyone in your travel plan.Best"
Hi there. I’m in Los Angeles and I’m going to this place in Beverly Hills https:/…It’s $225 for the test and other passengers that have been tested there have gotten their results in 24 hours and the paper work has the information ATN needs.
"Hi Jacob Paris,for the Stanford test, I just called them to make the appointment. Was pretty straightforward and the people were great. Results fast and definitely the correct test . I believe this is the number: (650) 588-9744"
"Awesome, I called the number but it does not seem to be a clinic, only medical supplies.Is it the right number?"
"Sorry Jacobparis. I can't remember which number I called. I just googled stanford health. 650-498-9000. I looked again, and I am sure this is the right number now!Here is the website: https:/…testing.html"
"Hi Andrea, My family was one of those ""hopeful"" passengers yesterday (Aug 4) booked on United 115, ready to board with our Abbott ID Now negative tests in hand. United scrambled, let us on the plane, and then... took us off. So the answer is NO, yesterday, they did NOT allow people on the plane with an Abbott rapid test. Since then, the Air Tahiti Nui website has been updated (several times) and as of 6:15 pm: ""RT-PCR Covid-19 test is mandatory for all passengers 6 years of age or older. The test has to be a molecular SARS-CoV-2 genome detection for Covid-19 by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction performed by a qualified professional. Please note that Antigen, Antibody, Self Testing or Rapid Tests of any kind, including rapid RT-PCR tests such as the Abbott ID* (ID Now Rapid tests accepted up to August 8th) are not accepted by the Health Authorities of French Polynesia and aircraft boarding will be denied."" So, basically, United denied us even though they should not have. We are beyond ourselves. Frantically trying to get another test done. We took a ""standard"" LabCorp test yesterday, hoping to get results by tomorrow - obviously a super long shot. But we don't know if the LabCorp test itself would be accepted. It does NOT say RT-PCR on it (it says ""Covid 19 test NAA"") - I emailed the Tahitian Department of Health to find out if they would accept such test. Another clinic we contacted said they do a test, but the results won't say ""RT-PCR"" - just PCR. This is such a mess. I cannot believe so many people were able to get this RT-PCR test done."
"I scheduled 4 tests at Arc Point Labs in Richmond. It is expensive but they guarantee the result in 48 hours. They also know what they are doing for. I confirmed with them on the call. Their test results includes ""RT-PCR"" on the paper.You can book online. https:/…"
"Oh. Is that correct? Latest update on Air Tahiti Nui webpage: ""RT-PCR Covid-19 test is mandatory for all passengers 6 years of age or older. The test has to be a molecular SARS-CoV-2 genome detection for Covid-19 by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction performed by a qualified professional.""So Under 6 years old kids don't have to do covid-test? Or it does not have to be RT-PCR?"
"Yeah, that's totally new. The Tahiti Tourism website also JUST got updated: ""A SARS-CoV-2 virus genome test (the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test) has to be carried out by all travelers from 6 years old in a health authority center (hospital, clinic, medical centre, Covid-19 testing Center, or medical analysis laboratory) within three days before the flight to Tahiti (at the passenger’s expense)."" We subjected our 2-year-old to the test twice already... for nothing. So mad. :("
"Flo-er That is really bad. So sorry to hear you did test for your little one two times.Edited: 9:55 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"Thanks GeziyozBiz. I wonder if anyone reading this has been able to get on a flight (United or ATN) with a LabCorp test result? Or with a test result that simply said ""PCR"" and was not a rapid test? We have appointments tomorrow at an SF clinic that has an option to rush results (MyDoctorSF) but they say their test result will only say PCR, not ""RT-PCR""."
"SO... I just got off the phone with someone from Tahiti Tourism (from their headquarters in Papeete; I speak French - I was actually born in Tahiti... anyway, I digress). He said unequivocally, all they want to see on the test result sheet is ""SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR"", so even if the test is not a rapid test and just says PCR (not RT-PCR) it will not be accepted."
"Hi all, Just wanted to update as I promised. Did my test at My Concierge MD in LA and my negative results came with 24 hours. I fly out this coming Friday Aug 7. They are pricey ($225 a test but you can get a superbill to submit to insurance), but totally worth it as they guarantee results within 24-48 hours. Highly recommend them if you are in the LA area; they are also super professional and very responsive via email and phone.The test results clearly says SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RT-PCR. Others in this forum (and on the French polynesia facebook group that I am a part of) have used this clinic before and have successfully boarded their flights to Tahiti. I also reached out to several yelp reviewers who had used this place and many had used this place for International travel."
We are planning on flying fromSFO tomorrow on United and have the ID Now results from Go Health Dignity Labs in San Bruno. Will United let us fly?
"Kristen K - It is an absolute unknown at this point. We were refused boarding yesterday (Aug. 4) on United out of SFO with this exact test (negative obviously); however Air Tahiti Nui website states that travelers with the ID Now test will be able to fly until Aug. 8, after which date the test won't be allowed anymore. So, if you were flying Air Tahiti Nui, I'd say you're probably good to go. With United... you'll have to go try your luck. I spoke with an official of Tahiti Tourism today and he said that the only website one should trust is theirs (https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/ which does not mention the rapid ID Now test) and he also said that they would not admit anyone with anything other than an RT-PCR test. Good luck tomorrow! I hope you do not have the same fate as us. If you cannot board, read more comments below - there are several options that seem to have worked, or should work (namely the Arc Point Labs in Richmond, or Stanford Health).Edited: 12:06 am, August 06, 2020 "
This all so ambiguous.When I got my test back from Reliant last week I was really concerned because it did not say RT PCR. It did say in green Air Tahiti cleared. I emailed to ATN and they finally called me back there was concernation about it not being acceptable (despite me calling Reliant and them assuring me all Tahiti travelers were using this) But the ATN rep called over to the gate reps and they said that it was fine. So the ATN rep noted my file and I had zero probs at the airport.I think you need to be assertive and dilligent like I did with clearing everything beforehand not wing it and show up at the checkin hoping you can pass thru.The poster who got turned away I would have been devestated. Good luck all. Its totally worth it if you can get here.
"Andrew F - the Air Tahiti Nui website changed several times over the course of the past 4 days (sometimes they made 2-3 changes in a day, like today). The Reliant test you got (Abbott's ID Now) has been called into question these past few days after Tahiti turned up 2 new imported cases of Covid-19 (including, hold your breath, an Air Tahiti Nui flight attendant). Hence the change in policy and Air Tahiti Nui changing their provider to a different clinic who does the RT-PCR test, now with 48h turnaround. Since Air Tahiti Nui has a direct line to the Tahitian authorities, they were able to clear this for their passengers - until Aug. 8 (sort of a grace period to allow all their future passengers to adjust). No such luck for United passengers. All passengers with the ID Now test on our United flight out of SFO yesterday were turned back. Yeah - French Polynesia is paradise.... Enjoy your stay. :)"
"Very informative reading all of this. I am booked on United out of SFO in early September.The Abbott ID NOW test was my ""plan A"".I am looking for other options now, but the Deep Nasal swabs freak me out. I saw some videos on these and I don't know if I can do that. I am trying to see if I can get a test that uses throat or shallow nose testing instead. Ugh. This is stressful.Edited: 8:51 am, August 06, 2020 "

The ATN site now states “rapid tests of any kind” are not accepted. The Beverly Hills site has the word rapid written all over it. That was going to be my go to site for when I fly out the 18th. Now I’m not so sure. Good thing I didn’t book an appointment yet as they are non refundable.
"Hi Flo-er, I am SO sorry that did not work out for you. I can't even imagine how disappointing that was. I appreciate you sharing that information. It's super helpful. I don't have much hope we are going to make it. We are not able to find a test that meets the requirements. Such a bummer all around, but my best of luck to you that you find one and make it to paradise!"
"Random Guy - the word rapid on their website is misleading as ""rapid” is just them saying that they’re able to process the test in about 24 -48 hours. The nasal swab test is a regular Sars COV 2 Covid 19 RT PCR test and the report clearly states the full name of the test with no mention of any ""rapid"" word anywhere. Several people have used this in the past week to board too. The antibody test they offer is a rapid test but thats anyways not allowed by ATN.Edited: 1:52 pm, August 06, 2020 "
Jyotsnq. I hope you are right. That’s what my gut tells me too. But they really don’t like the word “rapid”. I don’t think I will make any firm decisions about where I get tested until the day before. Guidelines keep changing and I will be sure to check if the testing meets all requirements.
Hello everyone . At airport for United flight. They updated accepted tests and now allow amplification test. It’s easy to get that one in San Francisco (use color) .
Is United posting online anywhere their guidelines?
"Hi Andrea F - thank you for the moral support. :) Were you flying out today? Or Saturday? If Saturday, it's still probably possible to get an appointment at the Arc Point Lab in Richmond if you are in the Bay Area (https:/…). Call them (don't book on website). They may still have available slots this afternoon, and some other people on other forums had their results from that lab in 25h. We just did this one this morning and crossing our fingers to get results in time for Saturday United flight (SFO, UA 115). Good luck!!!!! Really rooting for you, too. Jessicacarlin - if you're reading this, could you please clarify a few things for us hopeful SFO passengers? If you're still at the gate, would you be willing to ask the United gate personnel if they accept the LabCorp ""Covid-19 NAA"" test? (NAA stands for ""Nucleic Acid Amplification"", which is another term for PCR). Great to hear you got your Color test cleared. In principle I believe it is the same test that LabCorp does - but just making sure... Have a good flight, and enjoy your stay in paradise. :)"
"Hi , I didn’t do color. I did Stanford rt-PCR. But yes that NAA amplification test is valid now! It changes all the time, so young want to keep checking , but it’s allowed today"
Thank you so much Jessica! Fingers crossed they don't change the requirements yet again. Have a great trip!
Thanks so much! Good luck to you Flo-er (and everyone ). On the plane ✈️!!
Thanks for the info Jessica! Is there a place where United posts what tests they are accepting?What is the difference between an amplification test and the RT-PCR test?
"Hi Allie, As far as I know, United doesn't have this information anywhere. They just direct you to the Tahiti Tourism website (https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/) - which has itself changed several times in the past 5 days, and doesn't have any language about specific tests (other that stating ""the RT-PCR test""). My guess is that United folks just don't really know what they're doing. Aug. 4 was their very first flight from SFO to PPT after the July 15 reopening. In contrast with Air Tahiti Nui, they do not have a direct line of communication with Tahitian Health authorities, so my guess is that this is why they scrambled on Aug. 4 and didn't allow some passengers on board when they really should have. The difference between the NAA test and the RT-PCR test is subtle. I am a scientist and I am quite familiar with the terminology (I run PCRs in my lab all the time for my own research), and yet I cannot really tell exactly what the difference is (it's proprietary info that I don't have access to). Here is my educated guess though: Both tests are RT-PCR tests. Covid-19 is an RNA virus, which means that in order to perform PCR, one has to first ""reverse transcribe"" the RNA into DNA - that's the ""RT"" part - then, a PCR amplifies that DNA, specifically looking for viral sequences. The NAA test was developed by LabCorp, while most likely the RT-PCR test that is mentioned on the Tahiti Tourism website is the one the CDC developed. (this is where I gathered this last bit of information: https://ir.labcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/labcorp-launches-test-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19). Basically, any test that claims to detect the presence of the viral genome in someone's body pretty much HAS to be an RT-PCR test (or rather, it's the easiest way, so that's why all the labs do this). The issue comes from the fact that labs don't always have this language when they return the test results. We had appointments booked at an SF clinic (MyDoctorSF) that supposedly will return results within 24 hours. Initially they told us the results sheet would NOT say ""RT-PCR"" - just ""PCR"". The lab tech we spoke to actually did his research and called us back, saying that the test they perform is, in fact, an RT-PCR test (duh), and that they'd be willing to change their results sheet to reflect this. Turns out we had found another testing site through this wonderful community (Arc Point Labs) which states very clearly ""RT-PCR"" so we went with them instead (and lost $640 of cancellation fees with MyDoctorSF in the process, but hey...). Sorry if this was too much information. The bottom line is that almost all tests out there (outside of the rapid tests that give you results in 15 min.) are RT-PCR tests, but United just wants to see this spelled out (although now apparently they accept the NAA terminology as well)."
Floer-What a total disaster. The testing rules seem to change quicker than the virus mutates if you excuse the metaphor. Good luck!
Flo-er Thanks so much for the detailed reply! There is lots of confusion right now. This is complicated and not easy for planning. Hopefully the airlines and the government get the process smoothed out soon.
"FYI not a test specific post but in general about live gate updates.. UNITED at SFO is today (august 6) mandating that the TEST RESULTS be printed out on physical paper - not just on your mobile. While this was specified online I saw several passengers without print outs. they were subsequently directed to a travel agency located outside security to get their test results printed out and brought back to the gate. UA 115 is delayed 2 plus hours right now. the ETIS registration/QR code does NOT need to be printed on paper.Edited: 6:08 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Email received from GOODLIFE MEDICAL SERVICES:""Our current results turnaround is about 3-4 business days. We only offer 48 hour expedited results with Air Tahiti and the Tahiti Tourism board at the moment for an increased cost.The service is an out of pocket cost so no insurance or doctor referral is required. When pre-booking for our drive thru online the cost is $175."""
"Wow! Amerie63, thanks so much for this bit of information! Very useful. Do you happen to know exactly where they directed folks to print their results? We are hoping that we'll get our results before leaving our house on Saturday morning... but we were totally thinking that they'd accept it on the phone too. Right now seriously considering bringing our own printer to the airport, ha ha ha... :D What a mess. I hope you take off soon!!"
I also just spoke with Good Life Medical but they don't guarantee the 48hr expedited if you fly or test on a weekend. We fly late Tuesday night so now I don't know if we should risk it... Or go somewhere else that's more expensive.
"Hi Flo-er. no i do not know the name of the agency just know it is pre security. if i find out i’ll repost here. if u can print out everything beforehand do that to be safe. they made multiple announcements at the gate instructing people to print out their test results at this travel agency if they had not done so prior, since they would not be accepting mobile results. thankfully for those passengers there is plenty of time since we are still delayed."
"Amerie63, I couldn't find the place on United website where it says test results have to be printed. In fact, all it says is that the QR code from ETIS has to be printed. (from United website: ""Tahiti: French Polynesia travel restrictions: Travelers to French Polynesia are required to complete a coronavirus (COVID-19) RT-PCR test with proof of a negative result within three days before international departure and submit an ETIS application, with a printed receipt showing a QR code that must be presented upon arrival to the country."" I'm not trying to challenge your word, just pointing out that once more, it looks to me that they are totally improvising on the fly (pun intended... sorry), at the expense of poor passengers. Maddening."
Wow. confusing discrepancies and changes in posted information and what is being stated by united staff at the gate. again i would print everything as a precaution and be ready to present. we had an aircraft change due to a mechanical issue so we are still boarding. 4 hours delayed so far. document verification and boarding was chaotic at best. will post an update with more details once we get thru PPT airport.
"I fly out on Aug 8th with United. We were tested by GenX Laboratories in LA on Aug 5th in the mid- afternoon. They offer testing for $150 with a 24-48 hour turnaround. We received our results within 24 hours. The test results show ""SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR, UTM SWAB"". So this text looks like it will be acceptable by the airlines.One thing I'm a little concerned about is the results show the ""collected"" date time as ""08/05/2020 / NO TIME"". However, the time is printed for ""received"" and ""reported"" date times. I've heard that the Tahiti requirements now say the test must be performed within ""3 days"" before departure. Technically, depending on how the gate agent interprets ""3 days"" it could mean anytime after Aug 5th midnight or anytime after Aug 5th 1:20pm. Since my result only shows the collected date and not time, I wonder if the gate agent may have an issue with that.Does anyone have experience with gate agents looking at the time of the test and making sure it is within 72 hours before the departure?ThanksEdited: 11:49 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Just to clear the air for everyone. I flew out from LAX on Tuesday, Aug 4. There was a guy at a table next to the ticketing counter that checked the COVID test. Ours did not say PCR. But it wasn’t a rapid test. We took it at our local hospital in Tampa and their turn around was less than 48 hours. There were MULTIPLE places around LAX that were advertising 48 hour turnaround for PCR test . The flight was about 80 percent full and multiple families talked about how they flew to LA a few days early to take a test and ensure it would be back. They said the company that Air Tahiti recommended was a joke and not well run. There are multiple other places around LAX that I would do. Once the paper was check at the Air Tahiti check in counter, it was never looked at again. BTW someone was made to go to the office because theirs was on their phone. It has to be printed off. I had a letter from my doctor and other documentation trying to prove it was PCR, but he never looked at any of that. I guess they can tell it was PCR because of the turnaround time. We are 2 days into our trip and Tahiti is PERFECT. It is worth the stress."
"Hi gary65536, I am 99% certain that they do not check time of test taken. For 2 reasons: (1) I already went through test verification once with United, all they were looking at was the date (stated very clearly by the guy at check-in, and then by the personnel at the gate). (2) On both the Tahiti Tourism website, and the Air Tahiti Nui website, they give this example: ""If the flight departs on a Monday at 11pm, the passenger needs to take the test the preceding Friday."" No time specified, and obviously, one could not take a test on a Friday between 11 pm and midnight to make it fit within the 72 hour requirement. So... you should be okay with the timeline."
"Has anyone tried taking the test in a state other than CA? We are flying from Chicago, and id much rather not spend money on hotel and car rental just for a covid test. I am more worried about getting results within 72 hours."
"We are in the same boat as you here in Austin. Very worried about the turn around time on results, especially since we are such a hotspot for Covid testing right now in general. My travel agent is working on providing us with local options for testing. We are not able to spend extra time in LA to get it done there."
"So... if you need a test and want the results back in time for for your flight in Los Angeles area I highly recommend this place https:/…I know you will see the word “rapid” but it is not the 15 minute test. Read the website. They do the self oral swab, but do offer the nasal which I did to follow the guidelines for FP and ATN. We went yesterday at 1130am and received out results this morning. The paperwork STATES-SARS-COV-2(Covid-19) RT-PCR clearly on it. So if you are having issues in your state and need to come to LA to get tested this is the place."
"update as promised. arrival at PPT was simple and hassle free. Staff at a podium asked to see our ETIS bar code. mobile phone/screenshot was perfectly acceptable. not one question was asked re: covid testing, no documentation had to be presented other than a passport to breeze thru customs. FYI - we took a test in NJ on august 4. i want to detail the process in another post but short version is... i called about 20 different providers in our area to find out who would give us a test with such a quick turnaround of results. our insurance plan (BCBS) required us to get a teledoc appointment to get the referral/prescription for the test. we had a drive up test, nasal swab, no one out of the car. our test result sheet which was returned to us about 25 mins after getting swabbed says: covid molecular nasopharyngeal test negative. covid-19: negative. patient tested negative. there’s a sticker onit with a lot number, test id, user id, instrument serial number etc. NOWHERE does it say SARS or RT or rapid or PCR. this test was accepted without issue by united staff at SFO. any questions message me i can give more granular details."
Hi Depechetoi2-My husband and I are flying out tomorrow and also live in Chicago. We went to Vitality Urgent Care as the offer the RT-PCR test with results back in 48 hours. Hope this helps!
OnthewaysomewhereThanks!! That helps a lot!! I was really hoping to avoid staying three days in LA.
Did your test state rt-pcr on it?Any mention of the word RAPID on the test?
"Hi Amerie63, many thanks for updating us on your experience upon arrival at the airport in Faa'a. Glad to hear it is easier than at departure! Everyone must have been so exhausted because of the delay! Your description confirms that United wrongly refused to fly us on Tuesday as we had the exact same test as you (rapid ID NOW test sticker). Such bad luck as we clearly got caught in between the old requirements and the new, and someone, somewhere, did not have the correct information. We will definitely seek compensation from United as we have lost a lot of money because of their mistake (not to mention the stress, sleepless nights, trauma of being escorted out of the plane...). To folks reading this thread and not wanting to read all the way down for all the info: the ID Now test will no longer be accepted starting Aug. 8 (as stated on Air Tahiti Nui website) so find another provider from now on. Enjoy your stay in French Polynesia! And thanks again so much for all the information you shared."
"I'm so appreciative of this forum! I am now in Tahiti (by the hair of my chinny chin chin!). We were on the 4 hours delayed United flight from SFO yesterday (8/6). The check in agents initially tried to deny our Abbott ID Now test that we'd gotten at Dignity/GoHealth, (the printout was super basic and just said ""Your Rapid Covid-19 test is negative"") but luckily we had asked for extra documentation that specified it was the ID Now. My new husband had to argue with the first agent that the ID Now WAS an NAAT test and show the description that we had printed out. After being refused, we spoke to a different agent who was familiar with ID Now and the fact that it would only be accepted until the 8th (i.e., currently still accepted!!!). I'm so sorry for those of you who were wrongly refused! The plane was 4 hours late departing, but we were also upgraded to a larger plane so those of us in the back got whole rows to ourselves. United made a big deal about how the snacks would be pre-packed and waiting in our seats, but no, it was regular service. I was also horrified by the lack of hand sanitizer at SFO. In Tahiti they gave us our take-home test and a list of places to return it to. BTW, we had rented a car with EcoCar, but they were closed by the time we made it past customs at midnight. The Hertz was the only one still open. We had to pay $50 to take a taxi to our airbnb and then come back the next day for our car. But EcoCar was very friendly! Has anyone noticed that there are a lot of roosters in Papeete?"
"Wow - Opotamus, I see that even on Aug. 6 they were still scrambling... So glad you prevailed! (we also had additional documentation about our test printed out, but sadly that did not work on Aug. 4) We thankfully have our test results from Arc Point Labs (within 31 hours of taking it), the results sheet does state ""rt-PCR"" on it... So we're hoping to fly out of SFO tomorrow. Fingers crossed that they don't change the regulations on us once more. And yes... the roosters... not only in Papeete... they're everywhere in French Polynesia. A bit like the cats of Istanbul. :) I will be so happy to see them again."
"Just an update for everyone struggling to get here. It’s beyond worth it. And airport was so easy. Just have your QR code from ETIS on phone ready and test results. I landed and was in hotel in less than 15 minutes. People here are kind, it’s stunningly beautiful , and weather is great. Also, this group is great. I was speaking to someone in airport about trying to get test and writing on this forum. They asked me, “are you Sue”? Ha!"
"I didn't realize the French Polynesian islands had roosters everywhere! When I was planning this trip my husband asked ""are there roosters there like in Kauai?"" I told him no...wont he be surprised :o)"
"If you’re flying United, be sure to print your ETIS and test results at home, if possible. We just had to print our documents at the airport. It cost $5 to use the computer and $1 per page printed."
Can anyone tell me where to get the test in the SF bay area that's fast and says PCR? I live in Oregon and we are a backwards state when it comes to COVID testing. I've called everywhere in the state that does them (there are only 20) and not one will tell me if it's a PCR test! And my flight is on a Tuesday....no one's open on Sunday. I have to come down early to SF. Anyone????
"Randomguy - just wanted to update you and others considering my concierge MD. I just landed in PPT , this test is totally accepted by ATN. It’s the correct and regular type of RTPCR.Last night at LAX I also saw some ppl being pulled aside with rapid tests , even though ATN said it was allowed till the 8th! I didn’t see them near the boarding area or on the flight later at all. I hope they were able to go ! And I second Jessica - this forum has been so helpful! It’s been the most stressful trip to plan but it’s all so worth it once you are here . Good luck everyone and I’m happy to answer any questions.Edited: 3:17 pm, August 08, 2020 "
Petoonya - in SF Bay Area try Stanford testing center. I am from the Bay and I know many people on this forum that used Stanford and got their results on time.
Thank you VERY much!!!!! My flight is on a Tuesday. Fingers crossed they're open on Saturday/Sunday. Thanks again.
Has anyone done theirs through the Walgreens testing? Is it acceptable?
samiam721 and others outside of CA- GeziYozBiz mentioned Arcpoint Labs for SFO testing and I was excited to learn they have testing outside of SFO and CA. I am using them here in Houston. I also noticed they have a lab in Austin and other cities across the U.S. 24-48 hours PCR test results. Thank you GeziYozBiz for sharing Arcpoint and to everyone here for sharing your experiences — including at the gate. I had to scramble to find a new testing option since the Abbott test will no longer be accepted and this forum has been extremely helpful. Thanks again and safe travels!
My husband and I just got our test results through Walgreens. It took about an hour and the paper just says SARS CoV-2 negative and the date it was collected and the Walgreens Covid testing lab info. Will this be acceptable?
"I was able to get a PCR test through Providence at Bridgeport Village in Oregon. It says NAAT on the results, and I verified that NAAT is the same as PCR since we checked in without problems with ATN! (I verified this with ATN via email as well) The only downside is that they do not guarantee that you’ll get it within a certain time, but we took it on Sat at 9am and received our results at 2am on Sunday, what a relief since our flight was on Tuesday!"
Thank you Kim W!!! I just booked our appointments online for next month for testing. I was seriously thinking we were going to need to cancel our trip because we couldn't find a place. When are you getting tested for travel? Do you mind posting the turn around time for results? Really appreciate your post!!
"We just arrived in Tahiti from SFO yesterday (August 8th). We were worried about getting test results in time, but 2 tests came back within the 72 hour time frame even though they said 3-10 days. Stanford University was the fastest even though they said 3-5 days, it was about 24 hours. We booked our appointment online a few weeks before our trip. You don’t need to be a patient there, just create an online “My Health” account and then answer a short questionnaire and you can schedule an appointment. We also got results back in 36 hours from Color in SF. It’s free for any SF residents and requires an appointment. https://home.color.com/covid/sign-up/start…Good luck! It’s beautiful here, worth the hassle of trying to get a test."
Yep i hear one right outside my room now. Its the islands....
Hi Laura - thanks for the info! Which one did you end up using at the airport and did you have any issues?
"I arrived successfully in Tahiti yesterday. I’m happy to confirm the test from GenX Laboratories in LA were accepted by both United Airlines and on arrival in Tahiti. If you are in the LA area I recommend using them. The testing was smooth, their customer service were very helpful, the results were delivered within 24 hours, and of course the test/result format was suitable for the trip, stating “ SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR”. Be sure to tell them you are taking the test for a flight and that you need the RT-PCR test."
"I live in San Francisco and I have a trip at the end of the month, but they want a specific RT-PCR test. I will be in LA before my trip so I found this guy I think I'm going to go here. A bit pricey but worth the Avoiding the runaroundhttps://yelp.to/qTKq/blWqtSjPO8"
Sloan - I’m in Tahiti now and I am from the Bay Area. I went to the clinic that you mentioned ! Totally worth the price and effort. Also you can ask for a superbill to submit to insurance.
Hi Joystna! Thank you for the great news it gives me such a relief to hear that you are there in Tahiti and it went through perfectly fine! I just wanted to ask if they looked at the paper copy or were they okay looking on the phone as a screenshot. The airport and immigration also checks as well as that correct? And did the airport and immigration just take a glance at it?
Can you please let me know where you found a 15 min test site in SF? Thank you!!
I can't find a specific RT-PCR test in San Francisco but my neighbour did at the Forward clinic on Sutter St in Downtown but requires a 6mth commitment and he got his test within 48 hours.but I happened to be in LA a few days before my trip so I will go to the my concierge MD for my test Since there are great reviews and a confirmed quick turnaround before my flight
"Hi Gary65536I wanted to know your experience with the Gen X lab, It sounds like it was smooth sailing? i'm debating on going to my concierge MD and Beverly Hills or the one that you suggested for a cheaper price. Thank you and I hope you're enjoying Tahiti"
Are they NOW checking upon arrival to Tahiti too?This would be new from when I arrived July 21.
This doctor's office is offering a qRT-PCR test in SF with next business day turnaround.https:/…
Hello. Traveling in late September. Looking to take a late night flight out of LAX on ATN. Has anyone had success at a certain clinic on a Sunday for the 48 hour turnaround? Has any one tried the Good Times recommended by ATN? Thanks in advance!
"(Cross-posting from another thread)People on this thread had mentioned Tahiti Tourisme/ATN comms constantly changing but I hadn't realized FP had released a list of conforming/non-conforming tests:https:/…Listes-tests-FDA-et-CNR.pdf(Pulled from https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/)Would anyone know how airlines use this list? 'cause it obviously misses a lot.I'm booked for Stanford testing on Saturday. I read people did manage to board while being tested by Stanford, yet Stanford does not appear on this new list. Stanford does have FDA filings for covid testing but maybe they use a different provider/manufacturer?I'll try to call United and Tahiti Tourisme today..."
"Thanks Reginald. I am going to call ArcPoint Lab for same purpose. ArcPoint Lab website mentions clearly test is EUA registered. But I could not find the proof in that list. From ArcPoint Lab website:""The test measures the rNA content of the virus and provide positive results when the virus is present. The test is EUA registered and has 99% specificity and 95% reliability. The test is EUA registered and approved. This test is a lab based test with results usually available in 48 hours. Please complete the consent form before arriving to the laboratory days. To make sure you are able to make the 48 hours turn around time, please schedule the test before 3:00 pm or the 48 hrs are not guaranteed."""
We are in Bora Bora now. Have been in Tahiti since the 4th. Heading to Moorea later today. We tested at Stanford. Our results (4 of us) ranged from 29 hours to 40 something and we tested on a Saturday. I was shocked to get my results back at 7pm on a Sunday.We head to Moorea today. The weather has been great!!
We are on the same boat. We are from Texas and suppose to fly next month with UNITED and every place we have called has told us at least 3 to 5 days for PCR results. Its been stressful. If the abbott test is accepted that would be awesome.
"So I just called 2 different Tahiti Tourisme agencies, in Papeete and LA, and they both confirmed that tests must match one of the conforming tests listed here (watch out, there are 2 lists):https:/…Listes-tests-FDA-et-CNR.pdfThey confirmed that tests not on this list would not be accepted.I also called United but they're kind of clueless, and only asked for ""negative covid test"".Still trying to figure out which test site offers which test in the Bay Area..."
"I just checked the Tahitian tourism website that list is insane, they are located mostly on the East Coastand Are you just supposed to call the lab and get an appointment? Also are the United front desk agents going to study the results? I hope everyone can get to TahitiI think I will definitely go to the one in LA either GenX Labs or My Concierge MD.Edited: 1:52 am, August 12, 2020 "
"We just got to Tahiti from SFO via United. We took two Covid tests on Saturday. One at Arcpoint in Richmond (supposed to be 48hrs) and one at Stanford in Palo Alto (they said 72-96 hrs).Surprisingly, the Stanford results came within 48 hrs while the Arcpoint test took over 80. Both tests clearly stated the RT PCR method used.I would strongly suggest making sure the test results say SARS-CoV-2 RT- PCR and printing out both your test results and the ETIS QR code pages before coming to the airport.Edited: 2:44 am, August 12, 2020 "
We’ll get test at ArchPoint Richmond next Wednesday. I hope it won’t take 80 hours. We did not schedule two different centers.
"wesleyandrew We live in Fort Worth, flying out 8/23, and are testing at the Wellness Center in Fort Worth on 8/20. They have the approved PCR test (results sheet says ""SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by RT-PCR), take insurance, and have promised results emailed within 48 hours. Keeping our fingers crossed, but that's the one we're relying on."
"Hi samiam721 - We’re in French Polynesia now, arrived here yesterday (Tuesday). We took our tests Saturday morning and received the results late Monday evening. The director here at our ARCpoint location was extremely helpful in ensuring our tests were received and processed Monday bc the ARCpoint processing lab is closed on Sundays. Since we couldn’t take our tests any sooner than Saturday to comply with the 72-hr rule, we were definitely in a time crunch and he was awesome about getting it done. If you haven’t done so already, make sure you and ARCpoint are both on the same page on when you need your results by. :)"
"So this has nothing to do with the test, but since we have been on each other’s journeys, wanted for share. After all the craziness and Covid tests and registration, I made it to beautiful moorea. On first excursion here, I was getting back on a boat, and my leg got caught in boat propeller and it sliced it very badly in two places. Has to be rushed to hospital. And then transferred back to main Tahiti hospital. There they wouldn’t let me see surgeon until I took another covid test and waited for results (negative of course). 57 stitches later... I’m still here and it’s pretty but heartbroken. Can’t get in the water, hike, or even walk. Please be careful out there."
Oh my gosh Jessica ! I’m so sorry to hear that - I hope you recover soon !
"Reginald... When you say you called ""2 different Tahiti Tourisme agencies, in Papeete and LA"" , you mean you called 2 travel agents basically? Or did you call some official FP tourism Department? Another thread seems to imply that as long as its an RT-PCR test, then its fine. I am hoping to use My Concierge MD but now there is some doubt it will be excepted since they are not on the official list. I'm supposed to fly out on Tuesday so I have to test on Saturday. I don't want to use goodhealth as they cant guarantee results back in time if you test on the weekend."
"Jessica - holy cow! That sounds painful and heartbreaking. I am so sorry that happened to you. Thank you for sharing this story as a watch-out. I'm surprised that the excursion company would have the motor running when guests were getting back on the boat. I don't know much about boats, but that seems like a safety issue. I hope your leg heals fast and well! Random Guy - I think the ""approved list"" is the test manufacturer (not the clinic / health giver). You can ask My Concierge if the lab/test they use is on the list."
"Hi Kim! Thank you for your response. I scheduled with Arcpoint and am happy to hear you received your results in a timely manner. When I called and talked to the lab manager he was so friendly and helpful. He recommended I call the Friday before my scheduled test to see how the turn round times are looking. That way when we come in, he will make sure to send it to one of the local Austin labs with the current best resulting times. I hope that you and your family are having an amazing trip!!!Jessica....I am so sorry to hear of your unfortunate accident on your first day there. Please take care of yourself and use your time in that beautiful setting to relax and heal."
"@Random Guy, same here. I’ll be getting my test at Stanford on Saturday and they’re not on the list.Yes, Tahiti Tourisme is the official tourism department, pretty much like a visitor center here.I’m hoping that person on the other thread is right though, if results say “RT-PCR” we should be good.That’d be aligned with what United says.@Allie My Concierge MD uses Ultimate DX which does have an FDA EUA but isn’t yet on the list."
"Jessica, can I ask what tour you were on where you were injured? I'm so sorry that happened!"
"I looked at that list as well and it's insane. I saw a post from a person earlier who took the Stanford test and they got to PPT fine. I suspect that as long as it says RT-PCR they will let you enter. I took a test at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center last week just to check and the results came back within 27 hours. And the test page even says ""RT-PCR"" on it."
"AaronB, which hospital in Tampa did you visit? I am in Tampa, and I would love to get this done this weekend. Supposed to fly from SFO on United on 8/18."

Josh. When did you actually take the test and when did you fly out? The guidelines changed recently. I want to make sure my concierge md is still accepted.

"Was a private whale swimming tour, blue invitation. Apparently was on news here. Was a horrible accident and just praying I can walk again some day soon"
I booked at GenX in LA which also does RT-PCR testing with guaranteed 24-48 turnaround. A previous traveler on this forum went there and states he is currently in Tahiti. check it out. I leave on 8/27 w a test om 8/24 so ill keep you all postedhttps://www.genxlaboratories.com/
"OMG Jessica! I am so sorry to hear this!!! What island were you on? When we left Bora Bora on the 11th, they brought a woman on a medical boat to the airport and onto our flight."
"Hi Sue, that wasn’t me. I was on Moorea, taken by ambulance from boat to hospital. But was too deep for them to operate there so they transferred me by ferry (still bleeding!) to the main public hospital in Tahiti. After 4 hours finally saw surgeon. Still in a great deal of pain and can’t walk (or get wet, so no swimming in this perfect water). May be a year or so until I can walk normally , but hopefully I’ll be able to. So happy didn’t lose my leg, but it’s an awful situation and medial bills will be astronomical. The company doesn’t want to use their insurance from their boat. But Moorea is wonderful and I’m at the Sofitel. Everyone in a helpful here and kind."
Has anyone been approved with an oral swab?My dr says it’s the same test but you can do a mouth or nose swab. But they are both rt-pcr. Does Tahiti require it to be nasal?
"Jessica that has to be so frustrating! Did you purchase travel medical insurance before your trip, and if so, will they cover the costs? I am scheduled to go on a similar tour with a different company - any tips on how to avoid an accident like this (what to look for before approaching the boat)?Random Guy - I have been wondering the same thing. There is no language about swab type on the Tahiti Tourism site. It says ""RT-PCR"" and has a list of approved labs. So I would hope either nasal or oral is ok. But I would love to hear from someone who has done the oral to be sure."
"Allie S, no travel insurance (only credit card that provides trip cancellation), so won’t cover medical costs. As far as how to avoid, just be EXTREMELY careful near boat motor getting back on boat. Of course, the motor should have been off. So likelythat won’t be an issue, but they left the motor on"
I would imagine that an excursion operator is required to carry liability insurance.and is required to use it regardless of whether or not they want to. Clearly boating safety 101 requires motor to be off when passengers getting on board. Unless there is some quirk in French Law
"Anyone have experience flying United from SFO and getting aboard with test results from LabCorp? It is a PCR test, but not on the official approved list from Tahiti Tourism."
"Naxos, I agree- and asked them to use their insurance and they are refusing. No idea what my course of action is. Any lawyers on this thread?!"
Perhaps you need to contact a local attorney. What are the Sofitel folks recommending? Did they refer you the excursion.?
"Naxos, I’ll ask them again. They just said to tell the police. They didn’t refer me to the excursion, found on own :( but local attorney makes sense"
I know we all sign waivers before we go on excursions that include wild life and unpredictable and unforeseen events but I doubt we waive our rights if negligence is involved.So sorry that your vacation is spoiled and you are in pain. I spent a month in a house on the hill behind the Sofitel last May- I hope you can do some land drives - there are incredible vistas and sunsets around the island-
"Jessica, can the boat company really “refuse”? The fact that they kept the motor running while people were in the water is so beyond negligent! We went on a boat trip in Bora Bora and the motor was never on while people were in the water! Post on the “Off to Bora Bora” private Facebook page. Maybe someone can help you as there are people who live in FP on that page. There is also a French Polynesia Appreciation Facebook page where people ask all kinds of questions and get answers.I called my work medical insurance (Cigna) before we left and they told me that my coverage was the same no matter where we travelled so call your regular medical insurance! I am so sad this happened to you. Were you supposed to visit any other islands or stay in Moorea?"
"Great advice Sue, thank you! I’ll post to that. I was going to go to bora bora too, but had to cancel that. That’s great Cigna covers - unfortunately BCBS doesn’t"
"Another thought... although there is no US Embassy in Tahiti, there is contact for US Consular Agent https:/…french-polynesia.html"
"Hi JFenton1, i'm glad to hear they're open on a Saturday as well, yes please keep me posted! As I want to hear from current travelers that are in the same boat. And please let me know if they give you a bill and receipt so you can get reimbursed from your insurance. I think it'll work out fine because it is RT-PCR test and someone on this thread what he is in Tahiti and went to GENX."
"Hi Everyone! FYI, I got tested at GenX in LA and got my results in 23 hours. Their test is on the approved list of tests provided by ATN (called and triple checked.) $150 per person but worth not stressing about the 72 hour deadline. Got tested on a Saturday and since their lab works on Sundays, I got the results today."
"Great news JFenton1. I am assuming that GenX had all the requirements on the results you received (i.e. Covid-19-RT-PCR, etc.)? Let us know if it worked for you @ check-in :-). Enjoy your trip.Edited: 12:55 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Hi all! My family and I are going to Tahiti on the 18th and got tested at Stanford yesterday. We just got one person’s result back, expecting it to say RT-PCR as it did for most others here, but instead it said that the method was “Transcription Mediated Amplification.” I know someone reported that United had updated its policy to accept amplification tests — does anyone have insight into whether this remains true? Or, has anyone gotten tested at Stanford with this result? We were so confident in this test (and it was definitely the invasive one), but now we’re pretty nervous..."
"@Elyse, I’m in the same situation. I just called them asking for a letter that states it’s RT-PCR. I hope we’ll get it before our flight..."
"Reginald and Elyse P -- please keep us posted! I am flying on United out of SFO in a couple of weeks, and we are also scheduled to be tested at Stanford in Palo Alto. I know Sue on this forum was able to get on her flight with no issues with her Stanford test, but not sure how things have changed with the recent rise in cases and more strict test requirements on the Tahiti tourism website.How long did it take for both of you to get your test result back? Also, if upon boarding they require you to show this ""side letter"" saying it's a RT-PCR test, would you mind sharing who did you call to ask for this letter and what does it entails?Thanks so much!"
JFenton1 how were you able to get tested on a Saturday? Online they don't show any appointments for any Saturday?
"Hi, I am leaving in October for Tahiti. Had planned to have the LabCorp test, would you please share if you were allowed to fly with the test they used?"
"@Ray, I would not recommend stanford. I spoke to 3 different people to try to get the wording right (rt-pcr). The results say TMA, I’m not even sure it’s PCR anymore.We ended up driving to LA to take another test, with the hope to catch the next flight on Thursday.I don’t know if I should show up at the airport with that Stanford test tomorrow..."
"Claudia v I booked it a few weeks ago. Perhaps they don’t test over the weekend anymore but give them a call. Since everyone I know got their results within 24 hours, weekend or not, you will be able to get tested and get results in time for your flight."
"thanks JFenton1, i'll for sure call and since we leave Tuesday at 11:55pm if they aren't open on Saturday's i'm sure if we get it done Monday it won't be a problem!"
My wife and I just got our Nasal Swab done in the Dallas area at 9am today. They said we should get our results back in 48 hours. Our flight leaves from DFW at 7pm Friday. Hoping to get the results back in time. I'll report back when we get our results back for anyone leaving from Dallas in the near future.
"Does anyone have a suggestion on where to get tested near Irvine, Ca? I welcome any ideas."
Jessica that is horrific!I cant imagine the ordeal. What I think happened is maybe the operator thought it was in neutral (prop not running) but it was in gear. Not good safety protocol.I chatted with a couple when we left Tahiti and was told a story about a kid jumping off the end of a yacht and another boat hit him and killed him. It happened in Moorea. Its bad enought you got deal with Covid yet alone motorboat accidents

Hi everyone! Just got to LAX and wanted you to know that the GenX Lab test was accepted. No issues.
"We got our tests at Good Life Medical Services in LA which is the only linked place by the Tahiti tourism website. It’s a simple setup, drive up in a parking lot and get swabbed. We tested at 1:30pm on Monday and had results by 9:30am on Tuesday. Cost was $300 for expedited, didn’t use my insurance. Results state SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) by RT-PCR.Like for everyone there’s been a lot of stress for this trip so we wanted to go to the spot in LA that’s linked by the officials. If anyone wants to stress less, maybe just do a quick trip from S.F. to LA and get the test, my family did it and met friends and saw a little of LA while there. Adds to the trip budget but also gets results that should be smooth, we’ll see on Thursday’s United flight."
"I did the Covid test yesterday through the City of San Francisco (done by Color) and just got the results back today. I noticed that the test says ""SARS-CoV-2 amplification test"". It doesn't say RT-PCR and it's not on the list of approved tests from the Tahiti tourism site. Anyone know if this will be ok? We're scheduled for the United flight on Thursday 8/20 and I'm kind of freaking out!"
"The website states ""RT-PCR"" reverse transcriptase PCR. I dont think the list matters so much. I live in SF but will be in LA a few days before for a visit so Im taking the GenX test and a fellow traveler here posted GenX and is at the airport about to board to Tahiti. Theres a MD Abramson in SF on Sutter st a MD concierge service that has next day results I believe."
"tantan, there are two questions: 1) is the test you took an RT-PCR test? , and 2) will the gate agent accept your results and let you on the plane?Only #1 can be answered now, with a call to the testing facility. If the answer is “no”, you can either scramble to get an RT-PCR test done, or cancel or reschedule your trip.If the answer to #1 is “yes”, there’s still a significant risk that the agent won’t let you board. Others have reported success with getting and showing a companion letter from a doctor at the testing facility, on official letterhead, listing the date the test was taken and the negative result, and clarifying that the test was indeed an RT-PCR test.Best of luck, and let us know how it goes."
"The Color website states, “ Color is the only lab in the U.S. with FDA approval for LAMP technology, a COVID-19 testing method that is as accurate as RT-PCR, is about 50% faster and has different supply requirements.“ I’m guessing as accurate doesn’t count. Seems odd that if the testing is good enough for all of San Francisco’s essential workers, that it wouldn’t be good enough for this?"
Flight out of lax on Tuesday Took test at my concierge mdIn ppt now on the ferry to MooreaMy concierge md was really cool. I was being a total Karen asking for stuff I ended up not even needing like a letter from the Doc saying test was legit. I’m sure I was starting to get annoying but they got me everything ask for. But I was totally stressed out about being turned away. I actually got my test back in about 12 hour. There was a slight issue because the collection times were listed in a manner that made it seem like it might be a rapid test according to what an atn rep told me. I had them write a letter just in case but ended up not needing it. But they are highly recommended. And it was a mouth swab. My kids didn’t have to get freaked out by having something stuck up their nose.
"Today, We got our covid test at ArcPoint Lab Richmond. Fingers crossed."
"Did anyone use CVS minute clinic drive through test? It says SARS-COV-2 RNA, QL, RT PCR (COVID-19).My friend just took it and they posted her test results on a third day."
"@randomguy, that's a relief, concierge md is the place i'll be getting my testing done, are they still using the ultimateDx laboratory? and hope you have lots of fun on your trip!!"
Has anyone done the test at dodger stadium and been successful? They are getting results back in 48 hours.
"Hi Anna, The CVS test has the correct verbiage on the test result but that particular test is on the "" Not Approved Tests"" list of the Tahiti Tourism. I looked into it closely and the reason why it is not accepted by the Tahiti Tourism is because it is labeled as a "" home collection/ self administering"" test as the FDA since it is a self collected test rather than a trained health care professional collecting it."
Has anyone recently done Stanford test? And what is the actual turnaround time?
"Elena - I have finished my trip to Tahiti last week, but I went to Stanford this week to get tested after my trip just to be safe. I got my results in 36 hours, but the test says ""TMA"" and not RT PCR . These are 2 different type of Molecular assays! Even 2 other people on this forum said they had TMA on their test recently. So even calling Stanford and asking for a letterthat says RT PCR is futile cos its a different type of test. Seems to me that they do run both type of tests and you cant choose what they run with your sample. Although I have a friend flying out today (she took her test on Monday) and her test said RT PCR on it. SO weird, cos I took my test on Tuesday and it says TMA. So bottom line - I think they are unreliable cos you cannot guarantee what kind of molecular test they would run on your sample. I even asked them while getting tested and they said PCR lol! Luckily I didnt need this test for travel now but for the future I am going to use Arcpoint labs. My friend who I mentioned is flying out today had done 2 tests to be safe and her test from Arcpoint clearly says RT PCR on it."
"Was easy access with results from Good Life Medical Services upon check in at United. Print out results of test and also any other forms like the ETIS. Check in agent said he’s heard some people going to Dignity Health in San Bruno for tests, I don’t know specifics but anyone needing a test nearby could look into that."
Has anyone gotten tested at MyConcierge MD and flown United? I'm hopeful this will work because of positive reports of people who have tested there and flown ATN. Hoping for a similar smooth experience on United--can anyone confirm?
"Jyotsna - Yikes, that is not good. Thank God I was able to get Stanford to send me a separate note saying RT-PCR but it certainly created a lot more stress....."
"Elena - did you take your test in 1 of the 3 preceding days prior to your flight, but greater than 72 hours? My flight is late Friday night, and I have a test scheduled for early Tuesday morning. Will this be ok? What was your experience. Thanks so much!"
"Sue - so glad you were able to get that letter! My husbands results say RT PCR and mine said TMA . Luckily we didnt need it for travel! But when I called Stanford to find out they said that they are now approved to do COVID tests with both these methods and that there is no way of knowing in what way your sample will be tested - PCR or TMA!Glad I did this as a trial run, as I have another trip to another destination in the fall that needs testing before departure and I was banking on using Stanford, but might have to use another place now."
"I got result from ArcPoint Lab this evening.Test name was written ""SARS-CoV2 (Swab)"" When I talked with them, They said that ""RT-PCR"" was written.I am confused now. Did anyone get same test name?"
I have a friend who flew out today and she used arcpoint. Her results clearly said RT PCR. Does yours not say that On the result ?
No It writesSARS-CoV2 (Swab) Not Detected
"JyotsnaThere is another note at bottom.""The PCR test has been developed and its performance characteristics determined by Vibrant America LLC."""
"Happy to report we made it to Tahiti! To avoid any issues at the airport, United needs your test to say one of the following on your paperwork:-Sars-CoV2 Assay-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-Nucleic-acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-Sars-COV-2 RNA"
"@tantan220 I am glad to hear you arrive.We are going to fly from SFO with United. My test result has ""SARS-CoV2 (Swab)"" (from ArcPoint Lab Richmond) The lab that executed the test is Vibrant America. Their website tells they are doing ""Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR based test"" I need to call to get a proof this is RT-PCR test. I hope they run right test. It is so stresful."
"If you can get the doctor to write the name of the test using the verbiage of one of those four, you’ll have zero problems. When we flew out today the agents at the ticket counter in SFO had a print out of that verbiage to match to peoples paperwork. We did the Color amplification test through the city of SF and it didn’t match exactly, but after much back and forth they finally let us on. When we arrived in Tahiti no one even looked at our test results."
Thanks @tantan220. I am going to call them today. I hope I can fix it.
"Latest update.I sent an email to the lab that executed our test yesterday night. This morning, I got an email with updated test report from the lab Richmond lab collected samples. Vibrant America executed the test.Please be sure and let them know when you do test with ArcPoint Lab. They can take note on paper at least.Before fix: SARS-COV-2 SWAB TESTAfter fix : SARS-COV-2 SWAB RT-PCR TEST"
"It looks like the only people going to FP now all live in California. They seem to be able to get tested and get their results in time for their flights. Those of us in other parts of the country would not be able to go on Tuesday flights, which I have scheduled, due to no testing sites open on Saturdays. If I was going now and not in January, I would have to cancel due to inability to get tested."
"Susie, there are indeed a lot of people going from CA, but not exclusively. I know that several have gone from CO, for example. Fwiw, we scheduled our outbound flights (DEN-SFO-PPT) to take place on a Thursday, so that our “swabbing” would happen on a Monday."
Geziyozbiz - thanks for the update! Glad it worked out for you. Have a great trip.
@Geziyozbiz Thank you for the update on the ARC Point lab test. Glad to hear that you were able to get the test result name name corrected! Safe travels to you and your family!
I'm guessing that rapid Dignity Health test would not work?
"Thank you very much @Jyotsna @AmandaIt was so stressful. I could not even sleep. Now, we are closing our luggage :)"
"Do not do a home test. It will not be acceptable. Go to the Air Tahiti Nui website and you will find the most updated information. Right now, they are recommending a facility in Hollywood, CA. You can even get an acceptable test result for an extra fee within 24 hours."

"Hi All, I am at airport. United asked covid test for our kids that they are under 6 years old. I know there is exemption in Tahiti tourism webpage. When I tried to show them the proof. I could not see that exempt anymore in Tahiti webpage. But AirTahitiNui has this info. I took the screenshot. I passed check in at least. I will show it at the gate. I hope they will take us. Otherwise we screwed."
"emptnestco: I got my flight tickets months ago before any this covid c@#p was going on. I am flying UA on a Tuesday to coincide with the Wind Spirit cruise which departs every week on a Thursday. The day prior to Tuesdays for UA 115 SFO-PPT is Saturday, and I do not want to stay in Tahiti nor can afford to for 5 nights prior to the cruise. Arriving for 2 nights pre cruise is ideal. Unless I can find a way to get tested on a Saturday I will have to cancel the whole trip. But the way things are going there now, it may be cancelled anyways, not feeling optimistic."
"Gezi - were you able to board with your kids? I honestly thought everyone had to have a test, even babies, no? Our kids are older than 6 so we got them tested. I hope it all worked out!!"
"It's on the Tahiti Tourism site (click the green banner at the top of the page with the 8/12 update) that passengers ""from six years of age"" have to COVID test: https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/I would infer from that the kids under 6 years do not have to do so?"
I saw a specific question about United accepting My Concierge (LA) tests and I can confirm that they do. No questions asked. It was a very smooth process today. I think all problems have been ironed out for the most part. So happy to be in Tahiti!
"Yaaay. We safely arrived to Tahiti. United gate attendants did not know under 6 years olds does not need test. First, they thought everyone should have test result. I showed them Tahiti’s page. Then they let us to board."
Is it clear whether only PCR tests are accepted or NAAT would also be ok?
kpantslee - Glad you made it! Have a beautiful and safe trip!
I just took my test at GenX at 1000 in LA near AtWater Village. Guaranteed 24-48 hr turnaround with Cov-2 RT PCR nasal swab test. keep you posted I leave on Thurs fr SFO on United
Anyone know a place in NYC that can turn it around in this timeframe ahead of an ATN flight?
"Does the swab type matter? I found a place that can do the throat swab RT-PCR instead of the deep nasal one. I strongly prefer that, and it is the same test. I just don't want to get turned away on a technicality. Has anyone done a throat swab RT-PCR test?"
Did anyone get approved test donein Phoenix area?We are flying in 2 weeks.
"I got a not detected cov 2 rt pcr nasal test at Genx, I got my test at 1015AM and results almost 12 hours later at 930pm!! If you need a covid test before your trip go there! See you in Tahiti!"
Chris - what is the wording now on the Stanford results? Are they using the term RT-PCR?I had my test there on August 1st and it did not say that. Thankfully I was able to get them to add a separate letter in MyHealth that I could print and bring with me to the airport.
The heading at top of report says SARS-Cov-2 test. But in the details further down the report it says RT-PCR (which I highlighted for them :).
"Hi, All - For anyone planning to get tested at ARCpoint Labs in Richmond CA, I'd highly suggest calling them to confirm! I booked online with them last week for one of their 48-hour turnaround tests, and just today I felt the need to give them a call. Well, turns out they're randomly *CLOSED* the day I had booked, and their online system let me make an appointment all the same! The person I talked to in the office was neither friendly nor apologetic about what happened with their messed up online scheduling system. So, I made an appointment instead with MyDoctor in SF (that comes with an even more expensive price tag...), but I feel much more confident about them after the experience I had just attempting to book with ARCpoint. I'm just happy to have caught this in time without having to scramble, and I hope this saves anyone else the confusion with ARCpoint as well. Safe travels, all!"
Chris - glad that your Stanford test says RT PCR. Mine said TMA ( a different type of molecular test ) and my husbands said RT PCR. This was not for travel to Tahiti so luckily we were okay . But I want to share this out here to future travelers - Stanford isn’t a reliable option . I actually called the lab and 3 ppl at Stanford. From the past few weeks they have Been approved to use both RT PCR and TMA gets for testing. You Simply cannot choose one over the other since it’s a free test ( the lab will randomly choose which samples get tested one way or the other - explains why my husbands and my test were so different lol even when we got tested at the same day at the same time). So bottom line I think Stanford isn’t reliable going forward for travel. I think arcpoint labs or my doctor SF is way more reliable even though they are pricey.
"If anyone is traveling from Nashville, we were able to get RT PCR tests from Addiction Labs in Brentwood (on Wilson Pike) for our flight Friday! They guarantee next day results, but if you go before 10 am, they give you same day results.. it was very smooth. Their paperwork says ""assay is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 using nucleic acid amplification"", so not specifically RT PCR, but I got them to write an attached letter that states RT PCR and the type of test (which is on the approved list).. For those of you who had attached letters, do they require to say your name, date, etc too if the main test results says all that? Did y'all have a lot of scrutiny on the attached letter? Thank you!"
"Stanford isn’t free but they will bill your insurance. I also asked them when I checked in if it was an RT-PCR test. They confirmed that was what was in my record before I took it. So if someone does want to use them, I would clarify that with them before you even take it. We both got results in around 24 hours."
We're looking to get tested in mid October. Anyone know of a place that will have rapid results in San Francisco?
Chris - I also actually confirmed with them that it would be an RT PCR while getting the testdone. They did say yes and finally my test said TMA. This also happened to 2 other people on the forum (Reginald and another person). So I wouldnt trust them even if they say its RT PCR..
"Btw - not sure how relevant this is but even if you're doing a test and paying for it without an insurance (like RIchmond ArcPoint one), you should be able to submit a claim with your insurance company to cover the test amount as it appears that for Covid testing medical insurance covers 100% of test (without an expedited fee) regardless of whether it is in or out of network."
"Elena - you are absolutely correct. In fact, i just verified this with my insurance 10 minutes prior to reading your post. I have scheduled all 4 of us to get tests done at Arc Point Lab in Richmond, CA with a 2 day guaranteed test result for $270/ per person. I called MyDoctorSF.com ( who are recommended by the Tahiti Tourism follks) and they quoted for $430 that includes the "" special CDC"" version of the RT-PCR test along with the expedited fee. This is quite a big difference , especially if we add it up for all 4 of us. We will therefore we going to Arc Point Lab on September 2 at 10 am since we fly out on September 5 at 1PM. I did confirm with Tahiti tourism that it is OK to do the test 3 days prior and it does not exactly have to be 72 hours."
"Great information. Is this in print anywhere on the United website? We have a flight booked for late September, and we are in Sacramento, and scrambling to find a test that is fast enough and is on the crazy list that Tahiti tourism has posted. The Walgreens test (I had it done to see what it would say!) is from Lab Corp and says SARS-CoV-2, NAA, and the Project Baseline test is from Quest and says SARS CoV 2 RNA(COVID 19), QUALITATIVE NAAT. So, from what you posted, these would probably be accepted? Really hoping to make it to Tahiti, it's my 60th Bday trip, which was supposed to be a cruise out of Barcelona..HA!"
Chris - My Stanford results said TMA as well but they did write me a cover letter that said RT-PCR after I pointed out my results did not say RT-PCR.Sue
"Hi Minu and fellow French Polynesia travelers!We just got back from the most incredible two weeks in French Polynesia so can echo the sentiment that the stress of the tests is worth it!One thing to note regarding the ArcPoint tests from the Richmond, CA lab, we also did the 48 hour guarantee for $270 dollars and did NOT get our results within that window (tested Saturday AM received results Tuesday PM). Fortunately for us we also tested at Stanford which advised a 3-5 day turnaround but returned our results in roughly 30 hours. The test results we received from both labs read “RT-PCR” with date stamps reflecting when the test was administered. If we had just relied on the ArcPoint test we would have been out of luck as we received those results after we arrived in PPT. Do remember to print both your EIS barcode doc and test results as you need these to board and upon entry at PPT. Safe travels and enjoy the wonderful beauty that awaits in French Polynesia!!!"
Do you have to have your results on paper or is email on phone good enough? Flight is Thursday afternoon and being told results may not come until Thursday morning. I can imagine we may be at the airport hoping the email comes in.
"You do need to have paper print outs upon check-in, boarding and arrival in PPT. They unfortunately only accept paper print outs and will reject anything that is just shown on your phone. I don’t think they will even process your check-in without having the test results and the EIS barcode printed.Edited: 2:15 am, August 27, 2020 "
"Thanks for the update. That's great information. In that case, we will get another test at Stanford as well as Arc Point just to be on the safe side although I am not too excited about being poked around in my nose twice in one day !!! UUUUuggggghhhhh.....why does this whole thing have to be so stressful ?????Edited: 9:33 am, August 27, 2020 "
"Ok so I have a question. A test is required with a negative test result within 3 days of departure. Our flight leaves at 11:35pm on a Friday. We are going to get a test on the Tuesday before. What happens if the flight by, chance gets delayed by 30 minutes and the flight takes off after midnight (technically making the flight leave on Saturday). Are our results voided because test was technically taken 4 days prior? Or are they accepting results based on actual scheduled flight departure?"
Can anyone tell me where to call for the Stanford testing. I called the hospital lab and they told me no results guaranteed by 3 days. I'm assuming that the testing other posters are mentioning is at a satellite Stanford clinic. I have that Tuesday 1:30 flight out of SFO and would need the test done on a Sat or Sun.
OK. Got answer to my own question. Stanford clinic to schedule COVID testing is 650-736-5211. Openings through November.
Thanks for the info. Guess we won't be anxiously waiting at the airport then
"Sue - quick question how did you get that letter from Stanford? When I asked them they werent helpful.VL explores - Its good you did both. But I think arcpoint only guarantees 48 hrs if you test on Mon - thurs, when I called them thats what they said... I have also just finished my FP trip, but wanted to use Arc point for another trip to the Caribbean next month.."
"depechetoi2 - I don't think you have to worry about if the plane leaves after midnight. You check-in a couple hours before take off and that is when they look at all your forms. If you check-in at 8:30-9pm, you will be within your 3 day window.Sue"
"Jyotsna - I am kind of shocked that Stanford has not fixed the wording for the results to include RT-PCR. I know if was a pain for them to get a doctor to write the note and get it to us the night before our flight.What good is it for them to do the ""Travel tests"" if the wording is wrong??"
"Jyotsna - Great info! We asked as well as that was our primary concern given our 72 hour test window and the rep we talked to along with the person at checkin said that the 48 hour guarantee was in place as long as we tested before 4pm even on a Saturday (we informed them of our time restriction). We tested about 21 days ago so this may have changed and they may have tightened the timeframe. Either way for us it was good to have both tests going but hopefully our experience deviated from the norm :) Safe travels to the Caribbean!Edited: 12:43 pm, August 28, 2020 "
"Just to chime in on the Arcpoint discussion -- I called them two days ago (8/26) to try and confirm a test for two weeks from now. 72 hours before my flight is Labor Day, so I'm really limited in only having a 48-hour window to get tested. I told Arcpoint my time limitations, and asked how feasible it would be to get the results in *exactly* 48 hours (because that's all I'd have before needing to be at SFO). The person I talked to said that it ""might be possible, but we can't guarantee"" ... I'm not willing to risk my entire trip on their 48-hour ""guarantee,"" so I booked with MyDoctor in SF instead with their more expensive next-day turnaround. The peace of mind is worth the extra money for me at this point."
Thanks for sharing your experiences Teresa and VL explores. I agree Mydoctor is totally worth it for Tahiti cos the turnaround is so tight. My friend is in Bora Bora now and she did her test here.For other places that have a higher range of test window frame (for instance Turks and Caicos where I am headed next is a 5 day test before departure) I think arc point might work as it ll definitely come within 5 days.
"Stanford’s Covid tests for my husband and I both said RT-PCR test on them. It’s down in the smaller print under methodology. United took them without any issues, and I got my test back in under 24 hours. My husbands took about 30 hours."
Chris - mine under methodology said TMA. My husbands said RT PCR so weird . When I called them they said it’s 2 different things and I couldn’t get a letter .. as I mentioned since it was just a trial for me I didn’t bother too much ..
I am currently in Tahiti! The gate agent just glanced at my result. But said RT PCR and also PCR NAA is good. Hope you guys make it
"Hello, are you able to travel with Color Covid-19 test result?"
I believe the Color test is specifically NOT approved https://tahititourisme.com/wp-content/upload…
Has anyone had any luck with getting this test in the NYC/Westchester area?
"We leave in 4 weeks and we just went to get COVID tests to make sure we were not currently asymptotic and to check processing times. I started a new post about this, but it may get more attention here :) Tested at 8:30am yesterday, test results received at 2:30am today!Below is the information included in there results. Should I get my Dr. to right a more formal letter as this seems a bit weird and vague. :(COVID-19) SARS-COV-2 BY PCR, QUALITATIVE Collected on 08/31/2020 10:06 AM from Nasopharynx (Swab)Component: SARS-CoV-2 RNA Your Value: Not detected Standard Range: Not detected"
