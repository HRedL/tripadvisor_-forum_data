"Today I received an email from Lincoln Center saying all performances (including ""licensee"" performances, whatever that is) at Lincoln Center were canceled through May 17.However, when I went on the websites of LC's constituent companies (e.g., New York City Ballet, New York Phil, LC Theater), plus renters like American Ballet Theater, I could find no mention of that. NYCB isn't performing right now anyway, NYPhil still has notice from last week that are canceled through March 31, ABT's site mentions only cancelation of tour dates in other US cities and middle east, LC Theater mentions only cancelations through April 12, and even parent Lincoln Center still has old notice from last week.Maybe the various webmasters just haven't had a chance to do the updating from their new home offices. However, given that Met Opera has canceled rest of their season , plus what is generally going on and what we are being told about length of self isolation, it would make sense if everything was being canceled through at least May 17, in the event you have tickets for something before then.Edited: 1:20 am, March 21, 2020 "
Theaters have been closed by the state government. It will have the final say in the matter. This emergency may last longer than many think. The Met Museum is closed until July.
It is really dumb to use a term like “licensee” in a letter to the general public. It means non-Lincoln Center constituents who rent (license) the use of a hall or theater. That includes everything from massive television Upfronts to “vanity productions” (self-presented performances.)
"@Fox - where did you see that the MET Museum is closed until July, their website does not mention any date for the reopening."
"#3 - There was a report in the NY Times about the Mets planning options (some of which are possibly still TBD)""The Met, preparing for its own financial hardship, has developed a three-phase response: having all staff members work from home and continue to be paid through April 4 as the museum evaluates possible furloughs, layoffs and voluntary retirements; from April to July, evaluating how to control spending and reduce operating costs, including freezing discretionary expenditures and hiring; and from July to October, “reopening with a reduced program and lower cost structure that anticipates lower attendance for at least the next year due to reduced global and domestic tourism and spending,” according to the letter."" https:/…met-museum-coronavirus-closure.html #2 - People are often blind to the fact that their internal workplace shorthand vocabulary may differ and be possibly misunderstood. Not sure how much confusion that word may have generated"
"Websites take a while to be updated & no one knows when all of this will shake out. In addition, probably the web masters are on furlough & the rest are overloaded with cancellations. You need to have a bit of patience in all of this as everyone is getting overloaded."
"Thanks, ObsOperator, I assumed licensee would be something like that -- which would cover the renting by outfits as diverse as American Ballet Theater and Shuen Yuen (which I believe was in the middle of 3 or so weeks of performances at the Koch when they shut things down last week)."
"To #3, #4 answered your question. This is from the NYT. Of course, this is merely an estimate and the epidemic could drag on longer.Edited: 11:24 am, March 21, 2020 "
"https:/…#3 -- It's confusing because the Met made a public announcement canceling events and programs through May 15, then this story was in the Times. I guess they have a little leeway, but I believe the thinking now is that the virus will be around for a while and may not peak here until June or so. Though I think many were hoping this was going to be a couple weeks or so, it's obvious it's going to be much much longer, with no real end in sight yet. But these organizations have to do some financial planning and are using their best estimates on dates."
"And by the way, that term ""licensee"" would also include the colleges and universities that have their graduation ceremonies at Lincoln Center."
"Kudos to the Met Opera for streaming their Live in HD performances daily from the March 17th and the rest of the month free of charge. It is a nice gesture and hopefully will continue beyond March, if so many states are still in lock down.https://www.metopera.org/"
"Regarding New York City Ballet, I noticed last night they had a letter on their site saying they were monitoring situation, taking into account fact that CDC asked houses their size to close for 8 weeks and their 6 week spring season runs from late April through the end of May. So I guess they are waiting to see if that 8 week limit holds (it may not) and then, even if they can go ahead after 8 weeks, whether it would be worth it for only the few weeks of their season that would remain. I don't know if anyone is booked at Koch in June or whether, even if it were free, they would want to perform during that period."
"I don’t know how anyone else feels but I kind of wish abt would just cancel and would happily let them keep my money for a pair of subscriptions on hold for next year. I would prefer that than have to make the choice to go and risk everyone’s lives.And While in sure they are staying in practice somehow, rehearsals would be a crazy thing to do.Edited: 1:02 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"Yes, one other thing they have to consider is whether, even if they are performing, people will want to go, as I'm sure many won't.The last time I saw NYCB was at end of winter season, last week in Feb., and I recall that was the first time I thought seriously about whether I wanted to be in a crowded place. I went, but I paid attention to who was around me and had my hand sanitizer with me."
The New York Philharmonic has canceled its season as has the Met Opera.
"Many local arts organizations in Dallas are offering refunds for tickets and subscriptions regarding cancelled performances and seasons. At the same time they are asking patrons to consider donating their unused value rather than requesting a refund. The donation is tax deductible, and will help these organizations avoid a catastrophe. I am sure that New York organizations would prefer this solution, as well."
And I imagine they will do it when the time comes.
"I have tickets to three New York York City Ballet performances in April & May; it seems likely that the spring season will be canceled, and my intention is to donate my tickets.Took a look at the NYCB website and noticed in the menu under SEASON & TICKETS, ""Ticket Donation"" is now the first option, which was not the case previously."
