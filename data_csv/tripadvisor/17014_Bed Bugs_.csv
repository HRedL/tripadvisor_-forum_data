"Just got back from a week June22 - 29th at SWH. We stayed in the Dutch Village and had a fantastic time. However, we did experience some bug bites while there (nothing too terrible) but when we got home we both woke up a few days later with quite a few more bites. We were told the bites were from sand fleas, but I don't think sand fleas travel home in suitcases as bed bugs do. Also, from my research, sand fleas mostly bite around ankles and lower legs as they do not jump too far. Our bites are on our upper body as well as lower body. Can't call the exterminator since it is the 4th of July weekend but will call first thing in the am. Did anyone else experience this bug problem after returning home?"
"A total of three posts and all about bedbugs.....HmmmWhen I see a ton of other reviews all complaining about ""bed bugs"", then that would be something to consider as fact....until then, I'll take these ""three"" posts with a grain of salt."
"they may not travel home in suitcases, but it IS typical that sand flea bites don't show up right away -- you can be bitten and not notice it for a day or two..... so the bites you are seeing now doesn't necessarily mean you ""just"" received those bites, nor that they traveled home with you -- you could have been bitten before you left and just seeing the reaction show up on the skin now."
"did you check the mattresses at the hotel? if there were any bedbugs you would see their evidence around the seams and corners - this is one way to tell for sure if it is actually 'bedbugs', and not some other kind of pest. (I don't mean to imply that everyone should be obsessive about looking at their hotel mattresses - just saying that if someone has bites, that this is one way to conform - or rule out - bedbugs, before assuming any possible erroneous conclusions) -- cause there have been no bedbugs in jamaica so far -- heat is what kills them -- that's how exterminators get rid of them, they crank up the heat in a house to over 120-130 degrees...... scientifically speaking, since tropical locations are so hot it's usually NOT begbugs that are the culprits in hot locations.....Edited: 9 years ago "
"We have been to the WH four times and have never experienced a bug problem. Didn't know about the heat thing and bed bugs nevsgal, thanks for the info."
nevsgal - you should recheck your misinformation. The summer months in Las Vegas are warmer than Jamaica and they have had bedbugs.Florida has hot humid weather like Jamaica and has bedbugs. Cruise ships with a Caribbean itinerary have had cases of bedbugs.So you think Jamaica is exempt of bedbugs.You are right about using high heat to kill them or you can freeze them to kil them.
"ok fair enough. however i don't think ja is 'exempt'. - just that there have so far been no accurate incidences reported of them actually being there.... only people *thinking* it's bedbugs due to recent bedbug activity elsewhere, and assuming that's also what they got bit by in JA - when it's actually another biting pest.....also - according to the Science Channel, freezing does not work - only high heat kills them.....Edited: 9 years ago "
That sounds like sand fleas because they may show up a few days later. A friend of mine whom is a dermatologist had me mix benadryl cream and triple antibiotic ointment together and apply 3-4 times a day. It worked like a charm!
Sounds like Abby may have the right info.
"Sandfleas Can travel home with you! If you have a beach bag, beach towel, sand in your shoes etc. They are tiny little critters. We went to Roatan in April. I still have 2 bites I am dealing with! The buggers got into my area rug by my desk chair at home. YUP>>>>SAW them after I kept feeling something at my ankles and scratching. I had sat my beach bag/travel personal bag next to my chair when we got home."
There has been a several year epedimic in the States especially on the east coast of bedbugs.Several hotels in New York were sued about a year ago because of persons being bitten.I think it could be highly likely that the bed bugs are giting around.....just like roachs and rats they get around.I bring pyretherin based bug killer..I also hear that plastic mattress covers are good to
