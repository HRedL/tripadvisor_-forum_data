"Effective August 11, all visitors to Alaska must arrive with a negative COVID-19 test administered within 72 hours of departure. ""The state wants to conserve limited testing resources to address a rise in cases within local communities.""Reference: https:/…"
Would anyone know if travelers are still allowed to have a COVID test from 5 days before? That would be an important claification as most places the turnaround time for test is greater than 3 days.
"Per local news reports, there’s more to come on the actual wording, and other factors. That could take days, or up until Aug.11 when it is effective."
"Stan, from the article that Michael linked to, the 5 day turnaround won't be acceptable but who knows. Stay tuned."
COvid links for the State of Alaska that will get updated when the actual rules get 'written/finalized':https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/https://covid19.alaska.gov/travelers/A good visual as to why it is a concern to get this under control is the 'case chart' on the NY Times.If you look at this try and think about that we shut down schools here when the avg. daily new case count was about 10 a day. Since mid-July the state has been averaging almost 120 new cases a day. graph/chart: https:/…alaska-coronavirus-cases.html
"ScottCompletely understand where Alaska is coming from with the new pre travel test requirement. Just hope they allow 5 days before negative tests as well. that is all. :)Edited: 6:20 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Stan, I suggest you either find a testing site with a max turnaround of 72 hours, or delay your trip until next year when *hopefully* things will be more normal.I'm pretty sure the 5 day turnaround will NOT be accepted after Aug. 10, because such people also need to take an airport test upon arrival. No more airport tests for non-residents."
I am guessing that by saying everyone has to have a negative test within 72 hours that means 5 days is no longer an option. If you can find somewhere that offers the Abbot ID NOW test you can get results in less than 24 hours. We found them offered here at Walgreens (one location).
I too see the logic in the '5-day' thingy being gone because it too involved an airport test.An important aspect to all of this is realizing there's not an infinite and immediately available number of testing supplies. Alaska is in short supply of them and it is selfish/foolish for a recreational traveler to use up what is now a very valuable resource.
"It sounds like a good idea to me. Why should Alaska pay for testing for non-residents?That being said, I wonder if this kind of requirement violates a law. The US has laws that prohibit states from closing borders. What happens if someone shows up without a test? Will they get sent home?"
"I agree with other posters, I'm pretty sure its 72 hours or nothing. I am too curious how the state will enforce this, I doubt airlines will be checking prior to departure to Alaska. Are they going to not let people leave the airport? I agree with Alaska on this, and hope they can find a way to enforce this.I wonder..... will travelers still need to take a 2nd COVID test 7-14 days into their trip? In my opinion, this request always seemed silly to me and a waste of tests. I guess we will see in the next two-ish weeks."
"I am going to be critical here how is this going to help the state in this bad economy. Job data and GDP data isn't looking good. This ""72 hour negative or don't come here"" is just a ""constitutional"" way of denying citizens of their right to free travel."
"So I am leaving next week. I have set up to do an at home and they said 48 hours from when THEY get my swab back. So I will swab Monday, mail it overnight, they get it Tuesday and results back by Thursday (I leave Friday) I know I could technically swab Tuesday, they get it Wednesday and results back Friday and I would be in the 72 hour window but I doubt I would get them before I arrive at the airport on Friday at 6am.I want my results BEFORE I headed to the airport. So I will be a ""5 day person"" and restest at the airport since I will be there before the change on the 11thI wonder how many people will ""get their results while they are in transit"" and what if they land, turn on their phone and they are positive?What if they arrive without a test at all? what will they do?I don't know what the right answer it but I would think it would make more sense to not let them board their plane from their departure city without the results"
Governor is using this as a deterrence method to keep non-Alaskans from leaving their homes. He knows he can't violate the constitution. The airport staff will be befuddled by this too and won't be sure what to do.
"Lisa,- since you will be a '5-day' you do test again at the airport. You will fall under AK Health Mandate 10.1 section II a ii, ""ii. The traveler produces a molecular-based test for SARS-CoV2 result showing a negative result for COVID-19 from a test taken within five days before departure to Alaska and the traveler obtains a second molecular-based test for SARS-CoV2 upon arrival in Alaska, and minimizes interactions until the second test result is received and that test is also negative;""but you will also have to consider section II a iii:""iii. All travelers with negative results from a pre-travel test will need to minimize interactions until (1) they receive negative results from the final test for COVID-19, which is taken between 7-14 days after arrival; (2) for 14 days after arrival; or (3) they leave Alaska, whichever is soonest. If a second test is needed, they will receive a voucher.""NOTEs....It looks as if all travelers to AK need to 'minimize' activities until they:- get a negative test result from a test taken between days 7 & 14, or - they are here longer than 14 days, or- they leave the stateAll travelers should carefully review AK's COvid mandate #10 which was updated on July 14.see: https://covid19.alaska.gov/wp-content/upload…The FAQs may also help your understanding. Especially refer to:""Am I required to complete a second test, or is it optional? What does the Voucher mean?"" and""What does ""minimize interaction"" mean?""see: https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/"
"Lisa more...""I wonder how many people will ""get their results while they are in transit"" and what if they land, turn on their phone and they are positive?""- "" comes up positive, the traveler must isolate at their own expense, and will not be able to travel unless cleared by public health.""""What if they arrive without a test at all? what will they do?""- if before Aug 11, then they'll get tested at the airport- if after Aug. 11 that will b e interesting to see to what level the state goes to in that particular type of interaction. It does seem wise to check at the boarding/departing airport; but with 50 states it'd be very difficult for airlines to monitor/enforce all of this."
"Curious George,""I am going to be critical here how is this going to help the state in this bad economy.""- duhhh, it's going to keep people alive/healthierState to state travel can be 'restricted' as articulated by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the Supreme Court’s 1965 decision in Zemel v. Rusk.""Governor is using this as a deterrence method to keep non-Alaskans from leaving their homes. ""- our Governor has no way to keep a Floridian in their house, or in their state. Can he make it inconvenient to enter our state, yes.""The airport staff will be befuddled by this too and won't be sure what to do.""- our AK airports have handled Covid issues with great dignity, efficiency. Perfectly? Likely not; but very effectively.- I expect there will be a learning curve, but for the most part it will go well. The biggest issues will be with those people that are the '... but I want...' category."
"I understand they are trying to keep people safe, but this entire thing doesn't make much sense to me. Let's say I get tested 2 days before a flight, but I end up catching the virus on the flight (which is a much larger possibility than getting it at home). What does the testing accomplish in this case?Also, I wonder how the airport is managing this type of thing? Unless they have an area blocked off, I'm guessing you can probably just walk past the entire testing area.And there's still the question of what happens when someone shows up without a test. Are they going to send people back home? What if they are on the last flight of the evening?"
"""Let's say I get tested 2 days before a flight, but I end up catching the virus on the flight (which is a much larger possibility than getting it at home). What does the testing accomplish in this case?""Yep, by far the safest thing to do is go back to a 14 day quarantine for all arrivals. It's a balancing act between getting some of the economy back or returning to being virtually shut down. Just Google ""alaska new cases of covid"" to see a graph of how cases have risen....It would be interesting to know if anyone has done a survey of Alaska residents to see how they feel about what has happened. They were in really good shape virus-wise until opening up....""And there's still the question of what happens when someone shows up without a test.""We'll have to wait to see. Hopefully that person would be QUARANTINED in a hotel (at their own expense), with the choice of returning on the next available flight or staying for 14 days and then being able to travel in Alaska.Edited: 3:39 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Actually I think it all makes sense.They put in a rule/mandate; and they expect the public to follow it. What doesn’t make sense are the people that don’t follow it, or try to make up a loop-hole to get around it. I do understand the cheat/sneak/‘rules-don’t-apply-to-me’ thing is pretty much human nature; but, in your house do what you want. In my house follow my rules. In public follow the ‘social contract’ rules. Geez... stop driving in the left lane!!"
"Scott,I am hoping you do not represent the majority of the Alaskans. Your unwelcoming and rude behavior I can only hope is just yours and Alaska has nothing to do with it."
"If I’m rude & unwelcoming then what in the world do you call Canada & Europe?I call them right/smart/on-top-of-things.At this stage of the COvid game I’d be alright with a complete state border shutdown. We barely have the medical resources/facilities to deal with our own population let alone people that want to further burden it by trying to find loop-holes in the travel mandates.Notice that Florida is one the least successful states in handling this outbreak; and AK, even with its recent spike, is still one of the most successful at caring for its residents. Can’t stop shaking my head in astonishment."
"Curioustraveler, what do you think Scott is rude for wanting everyone to follow rules which WILL save lives?Personally I wish more people were like Scott. He's helpful and fun and has a really cute dog."
"While I agree with Alaska's decision, I disagree that tourists are to blame for the increase in cases, the data has been pretty clear with that. Outside of the fishing communities, I havent seen a large increase due to tourism. It does however seem that the lack of proper mask usage, and social distancing has been to blame, for both residents and tourists.I think the reason behind the changes is not becuase tourists are bringing COVID to the state (no doubt due to Alaksa's strict entrance rules), but becuase the state is running low on testing supplies and they want to ensure residents have access to them."
"Well, take Brooks Camp as an example - every single employee that is there was tested multiple times, and was quarantined in King Salmon prior to being allowed to go to the camp, and have been there without leaving. The camp had to be shut down this week because they now have employees testing positive ( a ranger that I know personally has contracted it). They didn't start allowing any visitors in until July 1, so where do you think those cases came from?And, I'm in agreement with Scott ..Edited: 5:11 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Travelers of all kinds. From returning snowbirds, to seasonal workers, in many types jobs, tourists, folks that travel for work, to and from Alaska, while living in AK, and not living in AK, etc.. Alaska went from the best numbers in the nation, to me, breathing a sigh of relief yesterday, we weren’t a TOP 21 HOT SPOT....like Florida is. Where two future visitors are from, now whining about Alaska wishing to keep her residents safe. Alaska could still get on that hot list any day frankly, and it is a mix of everything. But opening up, started our numbers going nuts, more testing capabilities helped increase numbers, and because we cannot stay closed forever, like Hawaii apparently wants to, here we are. We tried to be open for our visitors, and move our economy forward. Now because our resources are limited, we need to be careful, and put our residents first. A survey of Alaskans, and how we feel? All over the place. As much as I care about our economy, I care about our Alaskan people more, so closing us back up again would not break my heart. I’ve appreciated Canada’s strict adherence to safety because they saved us from much higher numbers, much sooner, by stopped cruise ships, and closing their border. I’m relieved none of it is my decision, because it’s an impossible position to be in. I support our governor, wish he flat said what will happen, if folks break the rules, cause there will be plenty, both tourist, seasonal worker and residents of any kind, that will. Folks are so interested in “what happens”? Leaves me feeling there will be plenty of rule breaking ahead. Already has been. Why we are in this position now, to some degree. Personal responsibility was lacking in way too many....I hoped that approach would work tho. Deb. P.S. Scott was about as nice as you get, responding to the posts he did. He WAS NOT rude. Sorry if you dislike honest answers CT.Edited: 5:31 pm, July 30, 2020 "

"I want to thank all the experts on this forum for helping me over the last two years plan my trip, you have helped me tremendously.Re Katmi, those people were likely all not all out of state tourists, so correlation does not equal causation.I want you all yo know that I work in healthcare and understand and care deeply about what is happening. However, I am over the ""blame tourists"" attitude becuase I do not think that is why the disease is being spread, and the data proves that. The disease is being spread becuase people are not taking proper precautions like wearing masks, social distancing, and washing their hands. Comparing Alaksa to my state, Colorado, Alaska is doing a much poorer job of controlling the virus over all. They have not mandated masks, bars are open, as are indoor restaurants. The governer even said that this new regulation was due to a shortage of testing supplies, not becuase tourists have been to blame for spreading the virus. For now, I am done with this forum, as I am tired of the ""them vs us"" attitude, we are all in this together.Again, thanks so much for all your help, I hope we can chat again in another 5 or so years when I plan my second Alaska trip."
"I am not Alaskan, but totally agree with Scott. I do not think he was rude at all, far from it actually. I wish our own state would adopt these same measures."
"Garfield, I agree, I think the data shows visitors to the state are not to blame for our increase in numbers. Hope everyone can stay healthy out there and enjoy what’s left of the summer & those that want to visit can find a test and have a great trip!"
"Reference Post #27:I opened this thread after reading the latest news. I do not recall reading anyone is banned from Alaska. Visitors are merely being asked to show up with proof of a clean bill of health which is a negative COVID test administered within 72 hours of arrival in the state. The quote I included explains exactly why Alaska was no longer going to provide testing for new arrivals. I have direct experience that people who follow the State’s testing requirements are not banned from visiting. Three members of my family on two different trips got tested at home without complaint, had negative results, and started their vacations as soon as their feet hit the ground in Anchorage and Sitka. They could do the exact same thing after August 10. Wannabe visitors who cannot get tested within the 72 hour window may want to question that if their home state’s resources are being stretched so thin the requirement cannot be met, why Alaska’s even more limited resources should be stretched to accommodate them. Besides, after my experience directing a gaggle from Indiana to the ANC COVID screening line after they missed all the signage directing them where to go, I have reason to doubt all folks who are directed to quarantine while awaiting results, do, in fact, quarantine during valuable vacation days. Alaska certainly has not gotten everything right. It took several spreader episodes in Seward bars for the town to get religion. The percentage of people wearing masks yesterday was orders of magnitude higher than observed during a visit about five weeks ago. As for Scott, the only issue I have with him is perhaps his dog’s name, which would be more fitting for some of the people who have chosen to attack one of the more helpful, positive contributors to the Alaska forum, simply for sharing his opinions. I think there is something in Constitutional Law about free speech that is MUCH better known than freedom to travel.Edited: 8:16 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Jugi, Which walgreens in Richmond did you find the abbott ID now test? Scott, I completely agree with the new rules. We as travelers are guests in your state and all local resources should be allocated as such. The burden should fall on us to be conscientious visitors."
"To Jaine T Post # 32. What country you are from?Here in America, every place within the 50 US States is home to the citizens. We are not guests in Alaska, Alaska is our country just like Florida is Alaskans' country."
"The US Constitution bars state borders from being closed both for commerce and personnel travel .To challenge this in court is very expensive, far beyond the means of the average person.Our court system only works for those who can afford itFor those who want Alaskan borders shut to tourists or their fellow Americans, say goodbye to the rugged Alaskan individual who wants independents from government on a sunny day and runs for regulation when the going gets tough Florida kept restrictions loose because tourists are the life blood of our state , sound familiar ?"
"""Florida kept restrictions loose because tourists are the life blood of our state""On July 7 Florida extended for another 60 days the order that travelers from the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut must quarantine for 14 days. Since it says it applies ""to all persons who have entered Florida after being in any area with substantial community spread within the previous 14 days"" it sounds as if it applies to many more states. https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/travelers/"
"That is political theater , blow back from their border legislation Three states with democratic governors, Florida with a republican governor.I would not be surprised if the White House was involved as it is an election year.The reality on the ground is well documented that many locals and tourists are not social distancing or wearing masks at bars and beaches as well as nursing homes being death traps.It is impossible to enforce except for a couple of YouTube videos.Two interstate highways , many ports large and small , five major airports countless smaller ones we would need nothing short of an iron curtain to make it work and 75 percent of the population would be out of a job and countless getting evicted.We have over 21 million people in this state and do you really think those college age adults are quarantining for 14 days before hitting the beach and bars .Alaska has limited ports of call , they could do it but it is a mistake."

"I am fully aware WHY those restrictions were put in place. I posted that info only to show that your statement about Florida was incorrect. In my opinion, in this time of pandemic, whatever measures a country/state/province implements to try to keep its people safer should be followed by all responsible citizens. People who refuse to honor such measures should not visit those places until the pandemic is over (treatments and vaccines). Unfortunately, a lot of people care only about themselves and don't give a hoot if their actions cause others to get sick, with many having lingering health issues and some not able to survive. If Alaska feels it does not have enough testing to provide to non-residents--and keep in mind that they HAVE done so up until now when they had a huge spike in cases so need to conserve limited testing resources for its own residents--then that should be respected. If vacationers can't arrange to have a negative test within the 72 hour time limit prior to leaving for Alaska, they need to change their plans...and maybe complain to their local officials about WHY they can't get results in 72 hours.... COVID-19 is NOT ""just the flu"". More and more studies are showing it attacks several organs including the heart, and is causing lingering and perhaps permanent damage.

"My statement was anything but incorrect.You don’t understand It was politically motivated. And unenforceable And you certainly do not understand the USA constitution.Most states have laws against spitting on the ground, .You can feel anyway you want , your panic does not change the rule of law .When Alaska became a state it was agreed the US Constitution was the supreme law over state law .Illegal drug use is a bigger cost to society and Alaska does not have the funding to deal with that so why not test all visitors to prove they don’t use illegal drugsKeep your big nanny state ideas in Canada"
"""My statement was anything but incorrect."" It is there in black and white for all to see. Florida does indeed have restrictions against some states. So what if it's politically motivated? It exists.As for ""panic"", we in Canada don't have to panic because we've managed to flatten the curve, though a couple of the provinces had a rougher time doing that. Take a look at the graph half-way down this page: https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/tw…And keeping our ""ideas"" in Canada and your ""ideas"" in the USA is the reason our common border is closed to all but essential traffic."
"Requiring a 72hr test is a defacto ""ban"" just like poll taxes were a ban on certain people from voting. What if someone needs to come to Alaska for family reasons and either can't find a 72hr test at home or doesn't have the money for the test?This is why we have to examine every restriction to ensure no rights are being violated. We need our rights even more during a pandemic."

"""Can the COVID test be the rapid test results?""...- being rapid or not-rapid does not determine whether or not the actual test is 'molecular' or not. It might be or it might not be. Ask what test they are using and if it is "" molecular-based test for SARS-CoV2"".From what I've read one of the more recent rapid tests in TX is a Quidel rapid antigen test. If this is the test, it is not a 'molecular' test. Antigen tests are very accurate when they produce a positive result; but the accuracy on a negative results are not as reliable."
Thanks for clarifying! I will Make sure to ask for the molecular test I believe results are coming back now in 24hrs in most places
