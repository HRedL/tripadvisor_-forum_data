"I’m interested in others’ perspectives on this. My family including kids are planned to go Oahu in March, and I’m struggling to decide whether Coronavirus is a big enough risk to cancel or postpone.I have been fairly comfortable even knowing that Oahu gets a fair share of tourists from more affected countries, but the recent case of the tourist who was diagnosed has caused some concern for me. This was reported to be a tourist who felt sick in Oahu but wasn’t diagnosed until he got back to Japan. Sounds like he stayed in Waikiki at HHV which is incidentally where we were planning on staying.It’s hard to decide - on the one hand the risk seems low compared to everyday risks like the flu, but there’s so much unknown in terms of uncounted numbers, severity, and where this is going.What decisions are others making around this?"
What about changing hotels? Would that put you more at ease?I'm hoping it can be more controlled but it's so hard to say.
"My girl friend and I are also going to Oahu in March and staying at the same hotel where he was at. I’m going to continue to monitor the situation. As long as it doesn’t continue to spread in Hawaii, we plan to go. I’m also going to consult my parent who are doctors to see their thoughts. I’m most worried on whether the military will still let me go. Pat"
We will be staying at HHV in 18 days. I have a medical background. We have no change in our plans at this time.
I will be honest and say that I have struggled with my trip to Hawaii. I was planning for April and I don't know what to do. I might end up in the Caribbean. I'm going to keep watching the news and see what happens.
Over 1600 people have been hospitalized and 43 have died from the flu in Minnesota so far this year. We need to get out of Minnesota. How many flu cases on Oahu? We won't be changing our plans to go in 23 days.
"The normal flu season begins Oct. 1. To date there have been 14,000 deaths from flu reported in the US. And you're worried about a new virus?"
"We're going late April: Oahu and Maui. I have no plans to cancel. I'm more worried about the flu especially since the recent wave seems to be affecting kids more (my kids are 8 and 11). But still, I wouldn't cancel travel plans for this."
The decision to travel is a personal one weighing the risks and the benefits. I’m here now and I’m surprised about how it all seems like business as usual. Even flying out of SFO all we saw were a handful of masks. I’m glad we didn’t cancel. I am more worried about the flu even though we are all vaccinated.
We will be there in 2 weeks. No plans to cancel. It’s a personal decision that you have to make.
My husband and I are having this same conversation. We are leaving on Tuesday and staying at the same hotel.
No. Could as easily get it at home given where I live and how I commute.
"The best way to avoid flu is to avoid people. Wherever you go you're exposed to the people present with you (and all the people they've been near recently). When you travel, *wherever* you travel, this pool of potential carriers expands. IMO avoiding Hawaii makes as little sense as avoiding Chinatown in your home city. What is your rationale?Edited: 10:41 am, February 15, 2020 "
"They might mean trips and plane travel in general. If I lived in some rural place maybe I would wonder about cancelling travel. But I live jammed up with people anyway so might as well travel somewhere.Living in DC? Virus city anyway. Metro, supermarkets, tourists...cherry blossoms coming up.Edited: 11:34 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Granted, we don't know enough about this 'new flu', but that's what it is...a variety of flu. It appears to be about half as deadly as our 'normal' flu, comparing the numbers of identified cases against the deaths. If you *think* you may have flu, talk to your doctor before presenting yourself (and your germs) in public.Word of Mouth near me has many cases of (mostly younger) people who've had and recovered from a flu that includes a high fever (over 102) and aches so strong that patients say their EYES hurt. Many have gotten some relief with Tamiflu.Edited: 11:54 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Actually, Sue--you have it reversed. The Corona virus is far more deadly than the ""normal"" flu.BTW, the man's wife (from Japan) was also confirmed to have the virus."
"Since this is a new virus, there is much yet to learn. But, yes, based on current data this virus is deadlier than influenza. The mortality rate of novel coronavirus is 20 times that of the flu."
"I see 1000 deaths v. 43,000 confirmed cases with the new strain. WHO says 14,000 deaths with 250,000 confirmed cases for 'regular' flu. More facts, please, if you have them."
"I have a trip scheduled for early March into early April. As of now I am not canceling but I am paying attention. My biggest concern is the 11 plus hours flying time on Hawaiian Airlines (JFK-HNL). Currently my itinerary is 6 nights on Oahu, 14 on the Big Island and then another 6 back on Oahu before heading home. Thank you for this thread, I will be reading with interest."
"Sw - it's actually looking like covid-19 is probably pretty similar to the mortality rate from flu, which in bad years is actually higher than most people think it is, for example as high as 2.5% for some of the flu pandemics of the past. According to recent studies, at a minimum 290,000-650,000 a year die directly from influenza. 2017-2018 was a bit of a bad year, CDC estimated 80,000 Americans alone died from influenza that one year. With covid they are estimating around 2%, but also saying that there are probably 10-20 undetected cases per diagnosed case, so that is throwing mortality figures way off. Probably this will be worse than the flu, but the level of panic is not proportionate to the threat, IMO.Edited: 12:50 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"As more people are diagnosed the mortality % should go down. At least early on many who had a mild case or no symptoms didn’t get diagnosed.Edited: 12:55 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"Teri and Kaeleku, very good points.Sue, I read the NY times and WHO and CDC.....I find the combination to be the best total picture.As they also change *how* they are diagnosing this, numbers will change, in many locations. Someday Hawaii might even get test kits.........."
I'm feeling the same way as you. Not sure if we should cancel our trip to Oahu on March22 and staying at HHV Rainbow tower.
"""More than 26 million Americans have gotten sick with the flu so far this season, leading to an estimated 14,000 deaths and 250,000 hospital stays, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""https://www.mlive.com/news/2020/02/us-flu-de…250,000 hospital stay does not mean that is the number of confirmed cases! There are 26,000,000 confirmed cases!"
Dusty -- Good point! And...it will be a while beofore we can know any equal comps for the new strain.
I would rather die because I went to Raja Ampat orvHawaii than because I rode Metro.
I'm booked in late April. Hanging in there.
Facebook just cancelled their annual Tech conference in San Francisco because of this virus.https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Facebook…
"Wow! Scary stuff. I just found out about this news by reading your posts. I'll surely do more reading on it. I don't blame you for thinking about canceling. And for those of you comparing it to the flu, while I understand what you are saying…. this is a totally different scare. People are beng quarantined and this is spreading very easily. I’ve been in the same room with people who have the flu and I don't catch it. And yes, we do get flu shots every year. I know I would not want to be in the same room with someone who has the Corona-virus, much less on the same plane. I’m keeping my eye on this since we are scheduled to go in May. And while I love, love, love Hawaii, I would also not have a problem with postponing our trip. I’ll have my eyes and ears open to see how this will turn out. I would be especially concerned about bringing it back home to my elderly mother and sister with respiratory problems."
"My husband, me, and my children aged 10 & 2 are all here right now. It’s business as usual. You see the odd person wearing a mask but otherwise everyone’s out having fun. We’ve taken public transit etc and all has been well. I mean, you could come in contact with it in your home city without knowing so I don’t see this as a huge issue IMO."
"""I see 1000 deaths v. 43,000 confirmed cases with the new strain."" That is one death per 43 cases! And this virus is spreading worldwide!""WHO says 14,000 deaths with 250,000 confirmed cases for 'regular' flu.""I like your comments! But I think you are wrong on this subject, only because of your error!And you already mentioned that you used hospital stays rather than actual flu cases. So I commend you for that!But already mentioned is that there are 26,000,000 confirmed flu cases in the country with 250,000 with a hospital stay with 14,000 deaths.With the flu, there is 1 death per every 1857 cases of the flu using the 26,000,000 figure of flu cases.1 death per every 43 cases for the coronavirus is far worse than the 1 death per every 1857 cases of the flu.One can get a flu shot every year to prevent the most prevalent flu virus. Many don't get this fairly inexpensive flu shot. They are the most susceptible to get the flu. And I do know that there are other strains of the flu that a flu shot does no good!As of now, there is no vaccination for the coronavirus!"
Yes we just cancelled our trip to Waikiki fortunately it was within the 24 hr grace period from the airline so full refund I am immune compromised so any risk is a serious risk We will wait this one out ....
"We have been planning our trip to Oahu for the past year and while watching the situation closely, don't plan to cancel as of yet. My son had flu three times in 2018 (Jan, Feb and Oct). He was extremely sick the first time (complications of pneumonia, sinus infection). At one point, the virus impacted his legs so badly that he could not walk for two days. So I have seen what a virus can do to an otherwise healthy person and it's terrifying - and as others have pointed out, we have vaccines and anti-virals for the flu. Believe me, we never missed the flu shot after that. And even with the shot, he got the flu in Oct when we flew from LA to NYC for a wedding. It was extremely upsetting and we actually haven't been on a plane since. There is always a risk of illness when traveling, especially on a plane. When my mother in law came out to LA from NYC for the December holidays, she was bedridden with the flu for 10 days. Scary stuff.We thought we would hopefully avoid flu by flying in April but like everyone else never expected Corona virus to be a risk. Right now, I'm willing to take the risk because I am so looking forward to this trip, but if the situation worsens (ie a huge outbreak in Hawaii) I would absolutely rethink."
"Scheduled to leave tomorrow and I decided to cancel. Lost every penny but I won’t need to have that regret. If I weren’t taking my kids and staying at the Hilton it might have been a different story.There are so many unknowns...does the virus stay in the mattress/carpet which I can’t wipe down, when we eat out did someone cough in our food, etc. there are too many unknowns and considering my daughter has asthma I decided against going. I’ve been in tears about it. Such a let down.Edited: 3:28 am, February 16, 2020 "
"Coronavirous gets weaker under warm climate like in hawaii. Even in case of infection, it might be just catching a cold for ordinary men in good health. I also plan to go to ohau next friday with my family including 4 year old kids. Wish me a good luck."
"Tsasas, Couldn't you just postpone the trip till later in the year or till the summer and not loose your money?"
"I'm sorry you decided to cancel.....esp since there was a case in Washington LONG before any in Hawaii. You have prob been exposed many times at home already.........and your chance of infection at the Hilton would have been very, very small. The virus doesn't live forever, and the couple left Hawaii on Feb. 7th. Surfaces carpet, etc wouldn't be infectious *now*----if they ever were. You also should know that the unit the couple was in was confirmed to have been **heavily** cleaned.......though there's no way to say you would have been assigned that condo.I would contact the Hilton and see if you can move your trip and save some of the money...ditto for air tickets. Maybe they'll take pity on you, though they don't have to as there are no known risks here.No one knows how this will go. Saying it dies in warm climates is not accurate though.Edited: 11:53 am, February 16, 2020 "
"I didn't want to add more bad news...but here goes. The passengers from the Westerdam cruise ship that were allowed to disembark in Cambodia earlier this week have now come under scrutiny--but too late.At least one person tested positive (twice) in Malaysia, after flying there from Cambodia. She is 83 and an American. Others are being tested.Why is this bad news? Because many other passengers already flew out of Malaysia to other countries..................including the US, Australia, the Netherlands....and others which are still being tracked down."
"I realize there’s no way to know if any virus lingered...but that’s the issue. I work in a hospital and the doctors I reached out to, that have been to special trainings, said the info changes from week to week. They don’t really know about this strain of the virus. If people (employees) were exposed and contracted it, this would be the week they come down with symptoms. I also know we have a case in WA and it’s impossible to be absolutely safe, but I can’t risk it. I purchased a package through Costco so working with the airlines and hotel wasn’t possible. However, I called Costco travel this morning at 6 when they opened and they were kind enough to refund me 75%, which goes against their cancellation policy. I’m so grateful."
I'm glad you were able to get a refund......Costco deserves kudos for doing that!
"Tsasas - glad Costco was gracious enough to give you a partial refund. We booked with them for our upcoming March trip - we'll keep an eye out on new developments but still planning on going (for now). Going to check my travel insurance to see what, if any, options we have available should things change."
"Costco was amazing and very kind about it. My travel insurance has a separate page which says the virus is not a reason for any type of refund, even if you cancel a trip to China. Only if you’ve been quarantined!! Next time I will purchase the cancel for any reason option."
"Tsasas, Hope you eventually go. Hawaii will be there waiting for you. Hope everyone stays safe."
"They have now confirmed that the couple flew back *******to Japan******** on Delta Flight 611, on February 7th.Still no word on where they stayed on Maui. https:/…"
The people that were on the plane after them... should be checked out. Would be telling how long it lasts to spread as well.
"Yeah. He wore a mask on the flight......but I don't think she did. Remember, she didn't have any symptoms until after landing in Japan. Oops."
Yep...and knowing anything will be weeks away...
We leave in 4 1/2 weeks - hopefully we get more info by then.
"I think we'll know before then, probably within 2 weeks, if not sooner."
"CANCEL. There are many Chinese HI residents that returned from China’s Lunar NY with symptoms and are on home quarantine. Additionally, 99% of the tourists come from China and Japan. We had plans in March and April to go outside of Oahu and cancelled both. You could not pay me enough to get on a plane right now with people coughing and sneezing."
"""Additionally, 99% of the tourists come from China and Japan""Wow.....talk about BAD info and spreading panic unjustly. The percentage of Chinese tourists to Hawaii is less than 2%. Japanese numbers are also quite low.There are less than 60 people on home quarantine, and ONE man in official quarantine.I believe there are more cases than we know--on each island---but I don't believe in spreading rumors either."
"I am struggling with this same question as we are travelling in March. I tend to believe the precautions will be huge in Waikiki, at this time we are still going, but I will monitor over the next week."
"If you are generally healthy and have no immune system issues, you will probably be fine. If you DO get sick, seek medical attention right away.I don't think Waikiki or anywhere in Hawaii will have ""huge"" precautions. They don't want to scare tourists. Some people and properties are def taking their own precautions but it's not like there is some organized mass effort. That's partially because they also don't think we have any cases......What concerns me is the growing evidence that this virus has a much longer period of infection than first thought--and that asymptomatic people are def capable of being contagious. Just today, 14 people thought to be negative weren't--from the cruise ship in Japan. They were segregated on the evacuation flight.We still have no test kits in Hawaii. All test have to be sent to the mainland and those are a four or five days turnaround. That's too long."
"Just some info I saw in our media today that might helpful. As we had the most Corona cases in Germany outside of China for a time, some learnings are available. The virus was spread by a Chinese colleague during a seminar. As the virus was detected only after the Chinese colleague had returned to China, several of the other seminar participants were not only infected, but passed the virus on to their families, including small children.The findings were that everybody can get the virus, but that the decease is not always showing severe effects. For most the virus felt like a cold with light fever and a bit of coughing. It spreads easily as the virus multiplies in the throat and not in the lungs (as previously assumed).It also seems that while children can spread the virus, they hardly show any symptoms (up to now they have no clue why).Special risk groups are elderly people, and especially man as well as people with a weak immune system (up to now also no clue why man are more at risk than women).Quit surprising for me, as I was deeply worried about the small children that were infected. In addition they mentioned that face masks will not help at all to avoid an infection, as the barrier is gone as soon as the face masks get wet/damp, which is according to the specialists after about 20 minutes wear time.Based on what I see I would not cancel anything if I did not have a previous medical situation that would put me at a higher risk, but in the end, everybody has to make his own decision."
"We are to leave Wednesday with my Mom, deciding now whether or not to cancel. (Having no test kits is a bit worrying!) Were it just me and husband, we'd probably still go but I'm concerned about Mom. Ugh this sucks."
"#50# 52Yes yes yes. There are not that many Chinese visitors! And if you are elderly, young, unhealthy think twice about flying. The FLU has been very bad this season. Corona virus isn’t the only concern. Thanks for posting SW."
plan on staying at the sheraton waikiki in june should i be worried

"This is getting scarier by the minute. 780 million people in China are currently under travel restriction. ""Restrictions include everything from self-quarantines to limits on who can come and go from neighborhoods."" That's more than double the population of the US."
"We are on the same boat!Our family (including kids 3 and 6 yrs old) are going to Maui and Oahu end of March. For now, we aren't canceling our plans and will just monitor the situation. I'm hoping there'll be more info and improvements in the next few weeks."
"""Coronavirous gets weaker under warm climate like in hawaii.""I don't think so! But perhaps! Can you provide some info to support your claim?I think any virus spreads the same regardless of any climate!"
"We canceled. We have put all cruises and plane travel on hold until a vaccine is available. It takes up to 14 days for symptoms of the coronavirus to show. A potential vaccine has been discovered, but will tentatively be available in 3 months after trial testing."
"Yes, we just canceled since we were going to stay at the Waikikian at the Hilton Hawaiian Village during spring break. The same hotel as the infected Japanese tourist. We love Hawaii so much and it is sad to not go, but, we cannot go and have fun with the thought of contracting it at the back of our mind. Let’s say if you can painfully afford to cancel your trip at a substantial financial loss of your paid airplane tickets and hotel cost, then do it. But then again, if you can accept the risk involved, then do it."
"Yes, my partner and I canceled our trip to Oahu this week. My father in law is an infectious disease doctor and believes that we would’ve been put at risk as people in Oahu may have been infected, are contagious, but aren’t yet quarantined as symptoms aren’t present yet and test kits are faulty. Even if we’d taken precautions, we would’ve been worried the entire time, and that defeats the purpose of a relaxing vacation in Hawaii."
Certainly everyone has to evaluate their own comfort level-or lack of.I think people need to realize the scope of this though; chances are so much greater for infection in your own *home* area than people seem to think........all those people who traveled and weren't checked or tested at all for months.They have finally confirmed a long running local rumor--the couple stayed at Kaanapali Beach Club on Maui. This is a timeshare property north of Kaanapali. Here's a news article:https:/…
Vancouver? Lol. You think nobody came back from China?
"I'm also going to Oahu soon, staying at the Grand Waikikian as well. I'm going to wait and see how things shake out over the next couple of weeks to make a decision. But unlike some of the others, I am much more concerned about Coronavirus than the normal flu. You don't get quarantined and treated like you have the plague when you get the flu. Regardless of how dangerous they are in comparison, the results of getting the new virus are much more extreme. Anyway, it's a personal decision like many stated and you need to be comfortable with you decision or you wont have any fun anyway and that's the entire point of going. Good luck (to both of us lol)."
"I disagree with this. Hawaii has more travelers coming from infected areas. I changed my plans. I'm most likely going to the Caribbean, but I'm going to keep watching there, too.I wish everyone well on their travels."
"Mmmmm...NO---Hawaii does NOT have more people coming from ""infected areas"". The visitor numbers from China are very low--always have been. Visitors from other Asian countries most affected by this are also low.The greatest number of tourists come from the US.Washington state, and Canada--both have had confirmed cases. Again, I urge people to do research about this before either canceling or changing plans....personally, I wouldn't want to go to the Caribbean given the iffy health care there."
"We cancelled our trip to Waikiki next week. We were going to live in Airbnb for 6 nights and 1 night in Hilton Hawaiian Village, a nearby hotel as the infected patient. I actually rly was looking forward to the hotel as it has great location and will have fireworks on Friday... It is a very difficult decision but again we don’t want to be worried for the entire time. Got all our money back, no loss. so should definitely book again after this virus thing all ends."
"We are leaving March 20th for Qahu and then to Maui. Planning on keeping an eye on things but since this couple left Oahu on 2/6, I would imagine that we wil know by then if more cases appear"
"I was studying in Mexico (Merida) during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Even being in the middle of a country affected by it, and having things shut down, I chose to stay and continue on with my experience. I found people were just as sick, if not sicker, back in Canada when I returned home. That said, I fly to Oahu in a few days and I have zero intentions of cancelling unless there are major changes in what is happening.I practice good hygiene and hope for the best.Edited: 12:40 pm, February 18, 2020 "

"The fireworks are about 4 minutes long, so no great loss, LOL.I wish people would stop and think rationally. The media skews reports and 'bulletins' to get ratings, not to inform. Numbers are tossed around like tennis balls and changed the next hour or day......like the 60% number above. 60% of what? Recent deaths? Deaths in China? Deaths in the US? Canada? Europe??Ages? Prior health conditions? Gender?Take some really deep breaths. Evaluate where you live, where you've been, where you are going. Ask yourself why you think Hawaii is ""more"" dangerous than your own home or nearby---cause chances are very good that you're wrong.Edited: 12:57 pm, February 18, 2020 "
My post was not meant to upset you. I was simply stating that 20% of tourism to Hawaii comes from an area where the sick couple came from. It is possible that more people could come to Hawaii not knowing they are sick from that country. That is something to think about.What you said about the Caribbean is true. It is a concern that medical attention will not be the best. I do believe the risk factors go down on a more secluded island.Have a super day.
"You didn't upset me......but your number is still off. What countries make up your 20% figure? 20% is a lot less than New York, Washington DC, and other mainland cities get from Asia/China/etc, too...........if your number is correct.No one can enter Hawaii (just like other states) from China without going into mandatory quarantine. No direct flights to Hawaii from China for nearly a month (and there were only 3 a week before that)."
"I got the swine flu in Sydney in early 2010. Nobody looked sick around me. I felt fine there, on plane to SFO. Got chills on second plane home, from SFO. Could have been sitting next to you. Death lurks everywhere."
"I didn't pull numbers out of the air. One tourism site from 2014, stated 18.3% of travelers come from Japan. A government site stated that the number was rising by over 2.5%.That's how I got 20%. Feel free to correct me. I love everything about Hawaii! I would just hate to book all my flights, rent a house, and need to cancel 2 months from now."
"Well, 6 year old stats and a ""guess"" sure don't make for good numbers, sorry.In 2019, visitors from Japan only totaled 136,998. I don't recall what the total from China was (or other Asian countries).Total visitors to Hawaii in 2019 were over 10 **million**. 137K to 10 million? Not 20%, LOL.You might want to google HTA and yearly tourists stats or HTA and tourists to Hawaii....the numbers are all public and there."
https:/…I'm pretty sure you meant 1.3 million.Take a look at the gov. site year 2018.This is fun. What else should I look up?
"Its just ironic for usWife and I were planning our big vacation for this March last year. Our choices came down to China or Hawaii (I'm Chinese/Hawaiian and hadn't been to either in decades - my wife has never been) - I was leaning for China, she was pushing for Hawaii. Of course, we chose Hawaii.When word broke about COVID19, my wife said she was glad we chose Hawaii. Now there's a possbility of not going. But in the absence of hearing anymore cases coming out of Hawaii, we have our fingers crossed"
"Another reason why we cancelled is because since all flights got suspended from mainland China to US, we have heard a lot of Chinese travelers enter US from Hawaii as the guard is loser, and travel there for 14 days, then go to the main US continent again. We feel Hawaii may have more foreigners and tourists who have a variety and unknown travel history. As compared to Vancouver, where most ppl are residents and low % of tourists."
Hawaii is US.
I will be on Maui in 3 weeks. I will also be on Maui in June... They will literally have to bar me from coming to stop me and my family LOL.
Vancouver is a pretty cosmopolitan and ethically diverse place. Hope nobodyb8went visiting relatives.Stay home.
"I have my two week trip to the paradise of Hawaii, I do not plan to change it."
"LOL--sorry for the typo, but it proves my point. Easy to post wrong numbers, huh?1.3 million out of 10.4 (almost 10.5) million tourists. Not even 10%........Mochi, you are sadly very, very wrong. I say sadly because you are operating under so many wrongs.If people do their research from RELIABLE sites and still feel uncomfortable, they shouldn't travel. Not to Hawaii, Vancouver, PA, NY, California.....or anywhere else."
"I still don't agree, but I will humbly move on to another topic. HeheHave a super afternoon!"
"Travel bug: barred from Maui.Lol!! I agree. It will take more than corona, flu, Zika, Ebola to keep me from my yearly trip. (But I do understand it’s a personal choice and some have pre-existing medical conditions they need to discuss with their physician)"
"I agree Hula..if there are special health reasons..but then you also have to be careful of the regular flu and other things too.However Hawaii is part of the US, not a secret way into the country. Maybe we could build a wall around Hawaii...as long as I am on the inside LOL"
"#81 confuses meHawaii is part of the US. It is a full fledged state, not a protectorate like Guam or Puerto Rico. Their guard will not be any looser than the mainland, especially now that this has happened"
"Traveling to HHV in April. If there is another case, then we are out. Does not seem possible that he did not spread it. It sounds like he was there for 3 days while sick. Does not look good. I just hope Hawaii does not try to hide information in order to get the travel dollars. They better be reporting the facts. Sorry, but 1 in 70 dying from this is no joke! Don't be comparing it to the flu."
"No one thinks this is a joke. But most of us also don't believe people should be panicking.You do realize that there are a number of cases in the mainland US, right? And that none of those people have died? Proper and prompt medical care is one huge, huge key to beating this--like most other illnesses. So far that's shown to work for all the US cases. The hospital in Omaha, Nebraska has an incredible setup--- and has some of the more seriously ill patients from the cruise ship...lucky they got taken there."
"I'm not joking about the flu and no, Hawaii authorities won't hide this for the almighty buck. It doesn't look good to make visitors sick or otherwise. They do want people to come in the future."
"Just an FYI, I am here on Oahu now, and it is difficult to get hand sanitizer. Many stores are sold out, and are not sure when they will get delivery. I suggest you bring some with you, and come enjoy yourselves."
"Good tip, DCrick! Thanks for posting that.Do remember that if you pack the liquid kind, you need to put it in checked luggage if it's over the TSA limit for carry on."
"Feel bad for those who have cancelled. These must have been difficult decisions. There seems to be aggression in some of the responses apropos of another thread ""Not a question - just an observance"" https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29220… This was probably not the intent, but that is how some comments here come across.However, anyone who thinks remaining in place guarantees they are not at risk is fooling themselves. At this point, anyone could be infected just about anywhere. And, concluding that traveling to point B rather than point A provides some sort of immunity does seem poorly thought out.A lot has been mishandled at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, but in the end, the dire situation is a matter of the health system having become overwhelmed by a highly infectious virus that leaves so many requiring intensive care. The US health system is incredible, but it is also fragile. Should COVID-19 break loose here, things will not play out much differently. As to Hawaii specifically, there were 227 licensed adult ICU beds in the state in 2017, 29 of these at MMMC. Most of these beds will already be occupied should an influx of patients present making providing appropriate care a serious challenge.There is no *right* answer. It is merely a matter of making the right choice for you and your family/loved ones. A decision to cancel travel plans does not constitute a rebuke of the destination. Travel to/from anywhere does increase the risk of contracting any infectious disease, so of course it is a primary consideration as to whether to cancel. Given the uncertainties, the choice to remain close to home where there is a support system, access to “in network” health care providers (for those fortunate to have *good* health insurance), and the ability to more easily avoid crowds and large gatherings seems reasonable.Wishing everyone happy trails and safe travels."
"Just left Oahu & Stayed at the Outrigger Reef. Hawaii is keeping very quiet about any coronavirus issues there. It's like business as usual. So yes, be weary. You will see cops escorting paramedics. That was my first clue that they are not being upfront. There were 39 people sick on the island as of 2/16."
"No. There are NOT 39 people sick. There are 39 people being monitored. There is one person in quarantine. Cops escort paramedics all over Hawaii, just like everywhere. It's normal and done all the time.Every news station and newspaper has multiple articles about it.Edited: 12:37 am, February 19, 2020 "
Follow this it gets updated talk to your doctorhttps:/…index.html
"My family will also be traveling to Oahu. We have considered the virus and made the decision to buy travel insurance and keep watching the situation. My suggestion would be to continue with your trip. Pack up some disinfectant wipes and spray to sanitize your room. Housekeeping is good, but it can't hurt to be a little over cautious right now. Also if you are planning to enjoy tour buses or the shuttles around the island you should think about renting a car for your trip instead. The island is really easy to navigate and you don't need a guide. Just do some reading up and use a map. There are so many things to do in Oahu you will have fun just exploring. This will help limit your contact with too many tourists."
"Leah - hopefully you purchased ""Cancel For Any Reason"" trip insurance. Costs more but it will cover you should you decide to cancel"
"Leah, did you purchase travel insurance at the time of buying your tickets?"

"Yes I did buy the insurance at the time of purchase, but you can add insurance at anytime prior to departure."
"It is not cancel for any reason insurance. I thought about that, but honestly we don't want to cancel unless absolutely necessary. And if it becomes ABSOLUTELY necessary I won't care it I loose a little money."
It is in many US places nowhttps://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-update-…See map
New data out yesterday. I look at how many people have recovered from coronavirus and the number who have died from it. The latest data says that 14k have recovered and 2k have died. That tells me that 1 in 7 die. That is not good. Any new cases in Oahu equals cancelled trips.
"One of the things we always pack are disinfectant cleaning wipes. We wipe down everything when we are seated on the plane: armrests, trays even air vents, same with our rental car. I also grab one when going to the bathroom on a plane. I use it to open the door, flush the toilet and turn on water faucet.And just so the you know how much of a germaphobe I am ....I never open doors at public places without doing it with my jacket, sleeve or any article of clothing so that I do too have to touch it. Another of my germaphobe tips is when you push an elevator button do it with your knuckle not with you finger tips. One more tip for the road... I always carry a pen so that i sign credit slips with my own pen and not the one everyone uses. I know this sounds extreme, but it works for me. I never get sick."
"Thanks Leah. We just came through a situation of not knowing if we would be able to go on our already planned trip. Airfare paid for, nonrefundable. Now the trip is a Go Ahead. And wouldn't it just figure, now the Coronavirus. I have never purchased travel ins. And never knew you could purchase it after buying airline tickets. Not saying we are canceling. Just wondering if we should consider getting the insurance now. For us, the air portion is the only part of the trip that we'd lose out on, but it's a considerable amount. So far I've only looked at one online site, plugged in info, but it didn't offer cancel for any reason insurance. Just trying to get info, to see if it's worth it. Did the company you used for ins,offer for any reason? Or do you know any that do offer it?"
"We go to Maui in less than 2 weeks and as of right now, we are still going. I have some respiratory issues so I am definitely nervous about the virus and plan on taking precautions while we are travelling. I'm keeping an eye on things but unless it spreads in Hawaii I don't see us cancelling, but wouldn't hesitate to if things get considerably worse. We lost a substantial amount on flights last year going to Hawaii due to the Max 8 situation. Ever since then we when we book flights we pay more for the ticket with free changes/cancellations. Whenever we book with a hotel/resort we always book directly and book with free cancellation (we're indecisive). We have booked a condo for the first half our of our Maui trip this year, which was 100% up front and has a 45 day cancellation policy, which we are now passed. So if we did cancel our trip financially we would only lose out on the condo.Edited: 11:39 am, February 19, 2020 "
"Happened across this article on travel insurance:https:/…Of note:Phil Sylvester, travel safety expert with travel insurance provider World Nomads, wrote in an email to us, “Be aware WHO declared a global health emergency on January 30 which makes this coronavirus outbreak a known event. You cannot purchase travel insurance coverage for a known event – the same way you can’t buy car insurance after you’ve crashed the vehicle. Meaning if you don’t have a policy that pre-dates that WHO announcement there may not be any cover for losses you incur related to the outbreak. Note I said ‘may’, and I urge anyone who has experienced a financial loss to submit a claim and let the insurance company judge the claim on its merits.”If you purchased travel insurance with a “cancel for any reason” option, you may be eligible to receive partial reimbursement from your travel insurance provider but check the fine print. Typically, a “cancel for any reason” travel insurance policy will only reimburse between 50 and 75 percent of the non-refundable trip costs, depending on the policy."
"Pattie - go to InsureMyTrip.com or SquareMouth.com and you should be able to find all kinds of policies from all kinds of porviders. Other than ""Cancel For Any Reason"" policies, travel insurance will not cover you if you just decide not to go."
We decided to cancel and I looked on our travel insurance website. There was a disclaimer that the virus was not a reason for reimbursement...even if your trip was to China! The only exception is if you are quarantined.
"Yes---as has been said many times.....only CFAR will cover this type of thing-and even that has limits and disclaimers.Pattie, I recced you buy trip insurance way back. I'm sorry you didn't. However, remember there are cases of COVID-19 right next to you in Michigan...........so your chances are greater of getting it there at home than months from now in Hawaii."
"I read that the Japanese couple stayed at the Grand Waikikian. We will be there in March with our 1 and 4 year olds. No plans to cancel our trip, but will keep watching. This was on Hilton’s website: https:/…travel-updates"
"There is now a TRAVEL ALERT for GW by HGV which is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort and shares all resort amenities. Would you take your family to stay at the same resort complex where there was a confirmed case of coronavirus? How would you feel if you were the cleaning crew who cleaned that unit and later found out the guests had the virus? How about the guests that checked into that unit after the infected guests left? Remember that the virus was not confirmed until the sick man got medical help back in Japan. I hope I am wrong, but I have a feeling HHV's problems are just beginning. We should know of any new Oahu cases linked to this couple in the coming week. I hope that there are none!"
"Please take a deep breath. Please.You are conflating and confusing a number of issues and facts with myths and hype.There have been NO indications of any cases at the Hilton. In fact, a resident who spent time with the couple in his own home is also fine........not a single issue.The number of people being monitored has fallen. The one person under official quarantine is also doing fine and should be released soon.THERE ARE NO CONFIRMED CASES ANYWHERE IN HAWAII."
"@AkamaiNick4SW You are correct that there are no ""confirmed"" cases in Hawaii.....yet. That does not mean that there are not cases in Hawaii. Hawaii has not received the correct testing kits yet. It is absolutely evident that the one or both of the Japanese couple had the virus while in Oahu. There is no questioning that. The timeline confirms it."
"As SW said, everyone breathe. The TRAVEL ALERT (sic) referenced in post #117 and linked in #116 is alerting travelers to the fact that Hilton will waive the cancellation/rebooking fees through 2/23 and will reassess if continuation of the policy is appropriate. It’s not an alert concerning travel dangers. It recommends consulting CDC or WHO for the latest information.(both reputable sites)."
"No one denied that the couple got the virus. In fact, I was the first person to post it--about him and later his wife.But you are still mixing facts and fiction. That causes panic and that makes for bad decisions by unknowledgeable people.While we don't have test kits---something else I posted a ling time ago---, we do have test capabilities and results have been obtained via the CDC.The incubation period has nearly run for both Maui and Oahu.....and still no reports of confirmed cases--or even suspected ones.Oh......more fodder for the panic loving folks--the man had some symptoms when on Maui, contrary to initial and long running reports. Quick, RUN, OMG."
"This is a very serious subject. Letting people know the facts of the case is absolutely necessary, even if those facts are ""scary"". Like most here, I will see what happens after the incubation period (I give it another week). If there are no new cases and everything goes back to normal, then my family and I will be there with bells on! I pray that Hawaii gets my ""all clear"" assessment!"
"Yes--it is a very serious subject. It is one that deserves truth and facts-not conjecture and hype.You do realize there are cases right near you, right? At home? I'd be much more concerned about those than anything here. Your chances are far greater there than here. Good luck!Each person has to do their own ""assessment"". I just want people to use facts for that process....not fiction. YMMV."
No cases within 500 miles of me.....yet
"Here's a post I put in Honu's thread about 'why so much on Hawaii"" about COVID-19. I think it's relevant here too:First reason we get more ""attention: Lack of comprehension about geography.Second: Lack of comprehension about Hawaii's status (as in we ARE A STATE).Third: Lack of comprehension about the list of 'approved airports' which includes HNL. No flights from China doesn't seem to sink in to people.Fourth: A misconception that Hawaii is some ""wild"" place, without medical care, people who speak, read, and write English, live in huts and eat coconuts and bugs, don't wear clothes, use coconuts for money........etc.Fifth: While some of the above is tongue in cheek--not all. You'd be amazed at the myths and bad info we see and hear every day. Add hype and media driven panic--BAM, you have a TA 'storm'.For those who doubt me, look back at Fukushima threads or threads about any earthquake or tropical storm.I try to strike a balance between understanding fears and concerns-and debunking the wild and illogical claims. It's hard sometimes, but I like to think that many people read more and realize how crazy some of the claims and hype really are.In the end, discussing things like this is good.......but there's also a need to provide solid and up to date info. That's not always easy in a moving situation."
"I stayed at the Waiikiki Beach Side Hostel on Feb 13th,2020-Feb 17th, 2020 ""approximately 500 feet from Waikiki Grand Hotel ""& saw an ambulance pick up a person from the near by hotel. The next day I seen on fox 6 news that a couple that had stayed at the Waikiki Grand was confirmed to have the Corona Virus for sure. I flew out on United within 6 hrs.Edited: 4:10 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"Peter.....did you know the man never took an ambulance or went to a doctor in Hawaii? Don't know who you saw, but it wasn't him........and it wasn't confirmed for several days that he had it--and more than that for his wife.Hope you didn't fly home just to have it closer to you! I am more than 2800 miles from any confirmed cases here in Hawaii---- and like it that way!"
"There's over 60,000 people in China alone confirmed with this virus. Waikiki ""Honolulu gets travelers from all over the world. It's very serious. I won't even go by my kids till after I show no signs of infection. When I left Honolulu less than 48 hrs ago, there was T.S.A workers wearing hospital masks, the threat is very real. Also when you're on the plane you have no choice but to breathe recirculated air with every passenger on the plane for at least a 4 hr flight. There was over 200 people on my flight."
"Many of us, including myself, have been to Hawaii many times and do not have any of those misconceptions about Hawaii. Hawaii is a state just like the rest. Although, the tourism industry is dominate for Hawaii which some could see as having a huge impact on official statements that are release about threats like coronavirus in Hawaii. News reports are saying that Japan is the next place for the virus to explode. Stopping any flights from Japan? NO!"
More space on the beach for the rest of us...
It was on Fox 6 news the next day that 2 people were confirmed to have corona virus that stayed at that hotel.
"True, TB4!!! And more room in restaurants, boats, condos, hotels, and trails!"
Perhaps folks are less experienced with air travel and long distance travel.Or less discerning wrt information sources.Public Service Announcement: get your medical and epidemic info from medical personnel or reputable news and information sources. TA is not one of those. Saying this is serious asking random people on a travel forum is plain ridiculous. Or do you just want to vent and get your hand held or your instincts supported? Fine ask for that. Be honest.Start here:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.htmlhttps:/…advice-for-public
"Thank you for posting this. My husband and our two children are also going to Oahu to visit my mother-in-law, in March. I'm worried about going and wondering whether we should cancel. My kids haven't seen Granny, though in 5 years, so I would be very sad to cancel. Don't know what to do.."
"There are precautions at Waikiki hotels, including the Hilton Hawaiian Village. That’s where the Grand Waikikian — the timeshare where the Japanese national stayed on Oahu — is located.I am flying in on Saturday, I'm not too concerned."
"Pattie, I doubt you could even *get* CFAR now. You can beg nicely, with the airlines, if it comes to that. They might have some mercy on fees.I hope people read reliable sources, factual sites, and make ***informed*** decisions---about travel to Hawaii or anywhere else."
"Just to clarify my thoughts about this, since I think myself and others might be misunderstood. It wouldn’t matter if we were planning a trip to Fla and the same thing occurred. I would cancel my trip. It’s not just because it’s Hawaii. A traveler has exposed people to the virus and we do not know how long the incubation period is (I’m reading as long as 24 days as reported by the cruise ship passengers that were sent home and then reported as positive) and we don’t entirely know how it spreads, they are learning more every day. The point that Hawaii was a concern for us was partly the long flight, and the potential for exposure on the plane, the fact that we would be sleeping somewhere outside of our home with no way to determine the type ventilation system, we would be eating out and since we were staying at the Hilton there’s a possibility of someone serving food that was exposed and doesn’t realize it. None of these have anything to do with blaming Hawaii or feeling differently about our trip there than anywhere else. Wa has a known infection here. From what I read he almost immediately went to the dr after returning sick so there is less chance of spreading it. I would also avoid any hotel he stayed at if that were the case and I was aware of it before travel. If I know the info, why not consider it?The main point of not traveling for us is the absolute possibility of many incubating the virus right now. So no, there are zero known cases, but that hardly means it’s not something to consider."
"I agree Tsasas. Does not matter if it is Hawaii or any where else. I think it is very naive for people to keep spouting that there are ""no cases in Hawaii"" without also stating that there is the possibility of many people incubating the virus right now. Time will tell, but the official statement should say that there are no known cases of the virus in Hawaii, but there is the possibility of people who may have contracted the virus from the infected Japanese couple and are not showing signs at this time. Giving the ""all clear"" at this point is ludicrous."
I will be in Waikiki in 2 weeks time and have no plan cancelling my trip.The risk is the same if I stay at home. I could catch the virus during my daily commute to work on a crowded train. But if the crowds are down when I visit that's even better.
"LOL....all along, I have said that there will prob be cases here-sooner or later. I've also said people could already be incubating it--from their homes or nearby. I've also said no one knows whether it's **anywhere**.....cause really, no one does.But freaking out and posting untrue things like some people have is also not helpful.Don't know what ""official"" statement people want.....I sure as hell don't work for HTA! They'd never want me-I'm too honest.Again--make **informed decisions**, whether you are traveling to Hawaii, Michigan, Australia, California, Colorado, New York, Russia, India........well, you get the idea :-)."
"Right, informed (evidence-based) decisions are a good idea. Unfortunately, evidence is scant at this point. The information we do have available right now indicates COVID19 is a highly infectious virus circulating worldwide that produces severe symptoms or even death in many people (~20%). Travel is a huge exposure point for any virus. Why is it such an offense that some folks choose to avoid travel in order to reduce their exposure? And why is that characterized as *panicking* or *freaking out*? Why can't it just be a reasoned decision that is best for that person?Agree that falsehoods and *fake news* are not helpful. Neither is shaming."
"I'm not shaming anyone. The mortality rate is about 2.5% not 20......that's a huge difference, yes?When people make a *reasoned* choice, fine--I believe I've said that 50 or 60 times. Let's not forget that I have also dinged the State many times in this and other threads for lack of info when it started. But claiming that cops are escorting paramedics due to this virus, that there's some conspiracy or huge coverup, that people are ""sneaking into Hawaii"" via some ""back door, that there are zillions of cases here, etc---no, I will step up and say that's not true. Because those things are NOT true.If it were your state that had this kind of rumors/stuff, I bet you would counter it too. Why is it hard to believe that some of us would do that here? Why is it ""shaming"" to call it fiction when it is fiction?"
"Well. He said she said!Fact is that a couple that stayed in Honolulu & Maui Hawaii within the last two weeks definitely have Coronavirus.Another fact is, I visually seen multiple T.S.A. workers at Daniel K. Airport along with many, I say many other people wearing hospital face masks.This virus is spreading...Also for those that laugh & say more room on the Hawaiian beaches & shops for you. Tushay... You can have it...The main concern for me is as soon as multiple cases are reported there. Good luck trying not to breathe the recirculating air on your flight with every passenger on your at least 4 hr flight. Like I said before. My flight was a Boeing 777 that seat's over 200 people."
"SW, I have always appreciated your honesty and integrity. Your advice and insights have helped countless TA participants. You have helped me personally, and for that I am grateful. You clearly have a fierce love for your home state. That is to be respected. It is absolutely appropriate to point out inaccuracies and falsehoods. It's just that statements like ""Hope you didn't fly home just to have it closer to you!"" and ""You do realize there are cases right near you, right? At home?"" sound like shaming from my point of view.We are all navigating this situation as best we can. Wishing everyone on this forum all the best."

"I am here now staying at the Hilton time share. I will say the Hawaiian tourist board has done an amazing job of “covering” up the confirmed Coronavirus cases here. Okay not covering it up, but they have not been forthcoming with info. There is a very good reason for this.... Can you imagine what would happen to the economy here if tourists didn’t come?? The impact would be felt greatly after a few days. You hear way more about it on the mainland. Based on what we have learned in China it would be extremely unlikely if the couple from Japan did not spread it to others. That being said... would I cancel? No, but if I was not traveling with a large group I would have had cancelled the Hilton and stayed elsewhere. Every cough, sneeze, headache, etc.., for the next 21 days I will ask myself could it be..."
"We are still planning on going on our March trip - to Oahu and Maui. And yes, we know the risk. However, we are confident that should any further confirmations of coronavirus appear, we believe that it would be announced - seriously doubt that anyone would try to hide that fact now. If that does happen, we will reassess our decision. Yes, coronavirus is spreading. Yes it has been fatal in ~2% of those that were infected. Not that I want to catch it, but the overwhelming majority of fatalities are 60 plus year of age. I am going to go by what we know rather than what we feel or thiink for now"
"People who are concerned about traveling should also read up about it in general. From reputable sources not random feel good you poor baby travel sites. It can be anywhere. If that's shaming, well, ignorance is not safety.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html"
"Auddy what type of info is the tourism board not being forthcoming with? First you say there is a cover up,then you say there's not. It's this kind of ambiguity (some would say fear mongering) that worries folks. What kind of info did you get on the mainland that we haven't received here? I am actually getting my info from the local news reports that include the state government (Lt governor is a doctor), the head of the Dept. of Health and local and national newspapers. Along with all the national news."
https://youtu.be/gojy7ChZ8h8I’ve been following Chris Martenson. It APPEARS that the CDC and WHO are leaving out some very critical info...You be the judge....
Just curious....Did Mayor Larry Vaughn from Amity Island become a board member for the Hawaii Tourism Authority?
"Really difficult decision that I cancelled my trip, which was supposed to be next week with my boyfriend... I feel very upset about it as I have had detailed planning and was really looking forward to it.I think it depends on individual's tolerance to risks.. I am a pretty risk-averse person and hate uncertainty. So after hearing the news about that couple getting the virus, I immediately feel uncomfortable and feel like I wont enjoy my trip anyway :(((. The airport & plane part is what I am mostly concerned about as I will be on a 6 hour flight in an enclosed space, as well as the Hotel - booked one night at Hilton Waikian Village, and 6 nights airbnb. My parents (Asian parents!!!) are also really really worried and anxious about this and warned me few weeks ago to just cancel it, largely because Chinese media has been posting nothing but the coronavirus as it is very serious in China. They feel if I get it I will spread to the family and I am very irresponsible... They think going to work make sense but other than that I should just stay at home - which is Vancouver... And this is very overly anxious to be honest. I feel so sad right now I couldn't go and just hope the coronavirus could end soon... it's like buying a stock and it's the uncertainty... Maybe if I went I could have a good time and no virus in Honolulu, even less busy due to the virus, but on the other hand if I got it, it would be a major threat to my health and my family's health as well."
"I am holding off booking my annual trip for a few weeks to see how the world wide Coronavirus crisis developments. I have caught influenza several times on long haul flights and it is always a concern for me when travellingI am looking forward to visiting Hawaii later this year..Edited: 2:01 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"Last I knew a few days ago, there were 4 confirmed cases in Vancouver. Any more since then?Still none in Hawaii.Your chances of being killed in a car accident or while snorkeling are far greater in Hawaii than getting this virus."

"Here's an article about the expected drop in tourists in Hawaii:https:/…BTW, ref the couple from Japan---the wife recovered and has been released as of Tuesday (from the hospital in Japan). The husband remains hospitalized (in Japan).The only person under quarantine in Hawaii is due to be released on 02-22. He had traveled to the Wuhan area. The number of people being ""monitored"" has fallen again, as more were cleared. They were also people who had close contact with, or traveled in China. If I recall correctly--the total is 40 or 41 people......none of whom have shown any signs."
"It has been confirmed that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted via aerosol transmission. The aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which can float for long distances and cause infection after inhalation. A standard mask will not prevent aerosol transmission. The (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirator. This explains the mass transmission on the Diamond Princess ship (air moving between rooms). Infected went from 10 to over 620 very quickly."
"Can you post a link to the study showing that...the aerosol part?It took weeks for the cruise ship problems, plus their procedures sucked. They didn't properly quarantine people from the start.Edited: 12:09 am, February 21, 2020 "
"Yes, I would like to see the source of your finding"
"Of course an N95 respirator will be recommended - it traps up 95% of particulates down to 0.3 microns. N95 respirators are the PPE most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route. It generally forms a better seal than most masks (used to work in cleanrooms up to class 10000 as well as tested and designed NBC masks for military, industrial and firefighting use) and is the most common, effective mask the general public has access to - you can buy them at Lowes and Home DepotEdited: 7:36 am, February 21, 2020 "

"People freaking out about stepping foot on Oahu yet at this very moment there are over a million people exposed on the ground there. Those poor souls!Edited: 12:58 pm, February 21, 2020 "
We are taking a cruise to Hawaii in April and then spending a week at the HHV (Rainbow tower) for a week post cruise. Ironically we booked this last week after our cruise to Japan for same time frame was cancelled as a result of the virus. Both Japan and Hawaii are on our bucket list and have never been to either. We booked HHV directly thru the hotel and to get best rate paid in full. We won't be cancelling unless things get much worse....or our cruise gets cancelled. For now we will just wait and see....that is what we did with our Japan cruise and the decision ended up being made for us.
"I'd like to clarify that I'm not concerned about being on Oahu. I'm concerned about the TRAVEL to get to & from there. On a plane you share RECIRCULATED AIR with lots of people that you don't know, almost same as inside a cruise-ship. It sucked for me to wear a face mask the whole way back to the mainland. I'm still waiting to see my kids that do not understand why I won't come by their house or see them for the next 2 weeks, while I out wait any POSSIBLE known incubation period. Yeah I understand that $$$$ is on the line for pre-planned trips. Is it worth your life, family or friends life for you to possibly spread it to them if you do become contaminated?"
"@ Peter C as its a worldwide virus, based on your concern, you would need to live in a bubble and stay home and not mix with anyone to eliminate the risk."
"True but, i was within a 25ft radius of the same Waikiki Grand Hotel reception counter as 2 people that have the virus were within the last 2 weeks. That's why I'm commenting, not just to be an ass."
"I'm wondering the same about my upcoming family vacation to Maui. That same couple was in Maui first and then Oahu. I really need a vacation, but it's not worth risking our lives. I asked the hotel where our reservation is, if they're seeing cancellations and they said they're not. I am going to decide by next week whether to cancel."
"HJH, where are you staying (on Maui)? The couple left Maui on February 3rd, and there have been NO cases here (or on Oahu).""Peter"", the wife recovered totally and was released from the hospital in Japan days ago. The husband is still in the hospital there. Their good friend who lives in Waikiki and spent time with the couple--CLOSE UP time----has not been infected and was cleared after 2 weeks of observation last weekend.People who actually had contact with the couple have all been cleared, and it's been weeks now...........on both Maui and Oahu.Again, at least right now----unless you are an elderly male with pre-existing health/immune system issues, your chances of being seriously ill or dying from this are low. Around 5% TOTAL of people who get it have a serious case. About 2 to 2.5% die. Most of those have been elderly men (with a few exceptions like doctors in China). And that assumes you would somehow *get* it in Hawaii.If people are uncomfortable traveling-fine. If they are scared of planes and airports-fine. I understand that. I don't understand perpetuating or creating fictions and panics, when the facts are very clear."
"HJHandRLH,Could you read all my 7 posts. I originally went to Waikiki 02/13/20. I'd like to mention that not one person did I see at the Honolulu airport wearing any type of facial masks. 02/16/20 I was about a block from the Waikiki Walls beach & seen an ambulance & fire truck w/ lights flashing. I asked bystanders what's going on. One of them said it's most likely a virus thing. I went back to my hotel & went to bed. I woke the next morning to watch Fox 6 news & they stated that a couple confirmed to have the virus stayed at Waikikian Grand Hotel within the last 2 weeks, they obviously been through the security check point at Daniel K. Airport.When I left Daniel K. Airport 02/17/20 there were T.S.A workers & many others wearing face masks.. It is my understanding of this virus that you just don't become sick immediately after you catch it.. There is an incubation period.. Then you get sick after you possibly spread it to others..I'm monitoring my health & taking precautions. I wish some one would have warned me that I'd be going through this scare."
The question that needs to be addressed is how many people have been tested to confirm that there are no cases in Hawaii. The answer may shock you.
"No, it wouldn't. There are no test kits----so no tests...just like much of the US.That doesn't mean they can't diagnose it. There are other ways, just like other states and countries are using. Again, don't travel if you don't feel comfortable. But don't post crazy stuff either....like some bystander knowing what the problem is, lol.Edited: 12:18 am, February 22, 2020 "
"So, you are saying that there is a highly populated area where people were confirmed to have COVID-19 and they have no test kits to confirm that there are no new cases? Sounds delightful."
"E-rock, Exactly!!! There are no over the counter test kits. If you believe you might have possibly been exposed... You have to do what I'm doing.... Hope & pray that you were not contaminated... The worst part for me is video conferencing with my kids via the internet for the next 2 weeks... So I don't possibly infect them...Also I stated what was stated to me by a by stander... They said it was most likely!!! I also stated that I didn't leave the island until after I read that it has been CONFIRMED that 2 people were there... What's crazy about that? Never mind... If you wanna travel to places where people are or were known to be infected.. That's on you... Remember you were warned..."
"Hello, I'm in Waikiki right now. Coronavirus is not a big threat. Use sanitizer, wash your hands and have an amazing time."
"Trena,Are you at Honolulu airport? No, because if you were... You would see Just about every T.S.A worker & Ticket counter people wearing face masks... Why would T.S.A. workers wear face-masks????Never mind... I'm done chatting about this...Edited: 2:12 am, February 22, 2020 "
Good lord the mentally ill are out in force.
Peter C - Am I understanding your story? You were staying 500 feet from the hotel that the two Japanese tourists were staying. Days after they left the island you see someone leave the hotel in an ambulance. A bystander says it is do to the virus and you decide to leave Hawaii the next day and isolate your self from everyone including your children for two weeks. Is that your correct story?
Sounds like we are better off with some people off the streets
"Thank you for sharing all the additional information. We are staying at the Hyatt Regency. I have a history of bronchitis and have had pneumonia previously. My understanding is that this Corona virus poses a high risk for respiratory distress which is why I'm concerned. My husband is worried about being quarantined so far from home, in case something does come up while we are there."
"HJH, lookAt cdc.govRead about coronavirus and influenza there. Influenza is very bad right now in the USA. That said my mom and I both did Maui last month.Talk to your doctor. He/she can best help you make a decision of wether or not to cancel."
"The number of cases in Italy is rising, as well as those in Korea and Iran. I would be more concerned about flights leaving Italy and take extra precautions there.....Yes, people create drama where it's not needed or justified. Some crave the attention, some just need to be drama queens. Facts-schmacks-who cares!!! It suits the narrative to be quoting fox and other inadequate/fake news sites."
"I'm sorry, are there not mandatory quarantines of towns in Italy, and multiple deaths and the virus is replicating on its own in your country? And you are worried because there has been one reported case two weeks ago in Hawaii? It sounds like your trip is still weeks in the future. I will bet you that by the time your trip rolls around, worldwide air travel will be discontinued and you would be praying to leave italy but cannot."
"I agree with Kaeleku.....I think chances are growing every day that we will see a massive cut in travel.Iran's numbers are like China---changing every day, and strongly suspicious. People from Iran already have been tracked to cases in Canada and France (people who left Iran before the govt. admitted the numbers and deaths). Korea's cult church is another huge 'spreader', and many people are hiding but not tested.....The first death in Egypt was confirmed; it's suspected many cases are there. Once this spreads more there, we will see huge increases in numbers.And of course--we can thank Cambodia and Japan for their bungled cruise ship fiascoes. More than 600 cases alone from the Diamond Princess.........and that doesn't count ones that have never been confirmed.So yeah, I'll happily stay in Hawaii. Esp in Maui, since the only ""international"" flights we have are from Canada--which should be checked immediately, IMO.Edited: 11:09 am, February 22, 2020 "
"So far we are still a go on our plan to Oahu, but cancelled our reservation with PCC Luau. Not a fan of buffet food in the place; people coughing, using same serving utensil.Edited: 12:16 pm, February 22, 2020 "

"# 184 ""By Vasanthi Vara ShareThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially named as Covid-19 by the WHO, has spread to 29 more countries apart from China alarming public health authorities across the world. A total of 77,891 (including ‭‭77,739 in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau) confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection including 2,360 deaths (including 2,349 in China, four in Iran, two in South Korea and one each in Italy, the Philippines, Japan, France, and Taiwan) have been reported across the world as of 22 February 2020."""
We decided not to go to NYC next month but it's not like that was important or that we can't go with a day's notice if we decide to.
"Alumnus, your cut and paste is old news....or rather, some old numbers.  Iran and Korea's are higher and I personally believe they should halt all visitors from Korea NOW, to any country. Israel already blocked them.Iran should likewise be put on the ""no allow in"" list IMO....but I bet it won't happen.Japan did a piss poor job, and Iran and Korea make Japan look good. I think we will now see this spread much more to the mainland US in the next couple of weeks......"
"Wow, SW. You should be complimented for trying to keep the panic down. Hopefully the test kits will come true in mid-March and Hawaii won't need them. Still can't believe that people seem less frightened of the Flu."
"Thanks, Shanty. I have less hope for this being contained in the mainland US than I did (as I indicated above). I believe there's been too little control and honesty from several countries....and that will work in the virus' favor. Even without test kits--just like EVERYWHERE, there are tests and ways to diagnose this. The test kits are nice-but they aren't the only way or the holy grail. So whether you are in Hawaii, New York, Illinois, etc., etc--all those defective test kits are pretty irrelevant. It is one reason I have emphasized getting medical attention ***promptly*** if you feel sick.The mortality numbers for COVID-19 scare people more than the flu, with some justification. However........those numbers are all from China, and subject to China's ever changing methods of counting cases and deaths. It should also be noted that most of the deaths are older males who either smoked and/or had other lung diseases besides the virus-caused pneumonia. Each person's risk tolerance is different. I feel quite safe here in Hawaii, partially because I have lived through many other health scares here. I have seen panic like Peter C's so many times, and for the same irrational reasons.Radiation poisoning, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, Dengue Fever, Rat Lungworm, Hepatitis, and Ebola are a few that come to mind. Each has real dangers-and some had cases in Hawaii---but my God, from the threads and media you'd think we had all died state wide with each of these.I read and research so I am aware and informed. If others took some time to do the same, they might feel better.......or worse about their risk at home. Frankly, you couldn't pay me to go to New York, DC, LA, Chicago, Quebec, Montreal, Vancouver, Houston, or Dallas right now. I'm sure people will post that I'm the crazy one now, LOL."
"SW.,Could & would you please explain why there are currently over 50 Hawaii residents currently self-quarantined? This is just the beginning. You seem to act as if there's no problem there, obviously there is. Check out this site that was posted by a Hawaii news outlet just last night.As far as I'm concerned , I'm taking proper steps not to possibly spread something I might have picked up while I was in Waikiki.https://www.kitv.com/story/41771019/hawaiis-…"
"Peter....how many times do we have to go over the same tired ground? Yes, there are people who are being ""monitored""--and I have said it many times. The number falls as people's time expires...and rises when people return from traveling. No mystery or secret plot.There is ONE man in mandatory quarantine, and he will be released shortly as he's almost done and has shown no symptoms.This is the case all over the US and the world. There are hundreds of people in Illinois being ""monitored"". Same for Massachusetts. Same for Florida. Same for California. Same for Texas. Same for Washington.Edited: 6:58 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"SW, I'm patiently awaiting your response! I'd love to see how you can try to down play your prior statement!When I left not to long ago. I took pictures of the T.S.A. workers & some of the many people that I seen wearing face-masks at Daniel K.I. Airport security check point line. My photos are date & time stamped, I wish I could post them here on this forum!Yes I was rationally panicking just like others, but for good reason!"
SW are you a small business owner there in Hawaii? Never mind!!
"LOL, Peter--I have answered you already. No, I do not own a business in Hawaii, I do not work for the HTA, I do not have any rental property, I do not work for any hotel, I do not work for any airline, I do not work for any restaurant........People all over the world were wearing masks by the 17th. Why do you think HNL was different? PS---there is no such thing as ""rationally panicking""."
SW. Irrational?Yeah right!!!Your states news source says there are more & more Hawaii residents INCREASING...Do you not read your own REPUTABLE state news sources & stay up to date on the fact that it's confirmed that 2 people w/ the virus were there? Do you think they just did not breathe or stay in their hotel while they were on vacation??https://www.kitv.com/story/41771019/hawaiis-…Here's a fact... Yes once again... Stop trying to act as if Honolulu doe not have a problem...
From Reuters out of China. A man had an incubation period of 27 days. That means he went 27 days until showing any symptoms. Remember that Hawaii is not testing anyone (with or without symptoms). That pushes the date for my decision on Hawaii out until March 7. I have seen multiple reports that the original 14 day period is not long enough. It moved to 24 days and now it seems that 27 may be needed.
"Peter:We aren't a Communist country here in Hawaii--there is no ""STATE NEWS SOURCE"". And the number varies........as you would know if you actually read the news.Maybe you need to step away, breathe deeply, and read slowly.If your irrational posts weren't scaring other people I would never bother posting facts for people to read. But your behavior is so crazy that maybe they will recognize that too.ERock: You are wrong. People are being tested in Hawaii just like all over. You need to read more too.Edited: 7:22 pm, February 22, 2020 "

"Watching this thread is like watching a social experiment. It’s interesting to see that adults default to the same bullying behavior that we condone teenagers for. Calling others crazy, from “special ed” and mentally ill because of their differing opinions. Last I checked this was an OPINION board. NONE of us have the facts because we can only research/read what has been released. This is a new virus, we don’t know all of the facts yet. Incubation period is changing, airborne/aerosol transmission status is changing, Information on transmission with/without symptoms is changing. None of us can claim to be more knowledgeable than the next. I didn’t think this board was meant to judge other’s opinions so harshly. I don’t believe anyone is intentionally down-playing or sensationalizing this virus. What we DO know is that everyone comes from a different background, has different reasoning and must make the choice to travel or not to travel. I have found that several TA boards have become grounds for mocking behavior and I think it now overrides the helpful aspect. I had to create a new account because someone from another board messaged me for MONTHS and finally began calling me a c***. I used to rely on coming here to research vacations but I think google is a better option now. Please consider being kind to each other and giving the grace you would want offered to you.Edited: 7:50 pm, February 22, 2020 "
Peter that is extremely rude! I have a family member who uses special education services. There is no need to make jokes about learning disabled people!
"Today, it was reported that South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases. How many flights are landing in Hawaii from Japan everyday? With sharp increases in Japan, it might be a good idea to get out of Japan and take a trip to Hawaii. These are people who feel fine and have not been tested just like the couple who traveled to Maui and Oahu. We all know what happened. The husband became sick in Honolulu and most likely introduced the virus to the islands. But we all know that Hawaii needs that Japanese tourist money and will wait until it is too late to block flights from Japan."
"Peter, re-posting the same link over and over and over and over doesn't mean anything. I read it early yesterday. And I agree that your name calling is rude and uncalled for.Yes--I can show frustration at people who won't slow down and read the whole news instead of the part they like. Yes, I can say that it's ""crazy"" to ignore the risk all over from this. And yes--I can be too harsh sometimes, perhaps.But again--CT scans, other tests and more can show or default this virus. I don't think people understand that very, very few places ANYWHERE have the infamous test kits. Yet somehow...gosh, cases have been diagnosed--a miracle!I tend to agree that the State will be stupid and not cut flights from Japan or more importantly-Korea---until it's too late. I said that ten or more posts ago, I think..........I still feel safer in Hawaii than the places I listed and many others. YMMV, and that's fine. But don't call me stupid, don't insult me or others---and stop freaking people out with quarter truths."
"I think we’ll see the truth about this terrible virus in a couple weeks time, if not sooner. Good or bad...things happen fast if it’s going too. I wish my beloved Hawaiian islands all the best. ❤️"
"Teresa, I agree and I wish *everyone*, wherever they are--the best.SW"
"Good grief Peter, that was way out of line! Could you please do us the courtesy of telling us where you live? It really does make a difference.Thanks SW for all your posts from the beginning. I'm bewildered by so many of the responses, especially the idea that there's a back way into Hawaii. My daughter's boss said it was caused by Fukushima - can't wait to tell that one to our friend who handles nuclear quality assurance for the Navy.My family works in tourism, but I don't. The virus hasn't affected tourism for them at all. The virus isn't a big topic of conversation among my friends, family, and over seventy co-workers. We know what the risks are but we're certainly not losing sleep over it yet. We'll just do our due diligence in trying to stay healthy and frequently wash our hands. I have a trip planned to California next month and I'm going unless an epidemic breaks out here or in California.I wish everyone the best with whatever your choice is and I realize everyone has their own level of comfort and anxiety."
"The growing number of new cases outside of China esp in South Korea and Iran, plus Japan and Italy too, are concerning. Current screening established by the CDC includes China travel history only. In the vast majority of cases, diagnostic testing (""test kit"") is only indicated for patients meeting the travel history criterion. Hopefully the CDC will soon update their risk criteria to include these countries."
"Peter C, here’s what I wonder about. You believe that you have possibly been exposed to the virus. Instead of contacting health authorities and isolating yourself in your hotel room, you hopped on a plane and flew back to the mainland, exposing 200 fellow passengers, the flight crew and your community to any contagions you are carrying.How do you justify your actions?"
"Hi there,I did not mean to offend any one because of my question which could have been perceived as rude. My apology to any one offended.As for where I live... It's here on planet Earth.We are all gonna feel the impact of this virus, well maybe the scare of it, definitely economic wise.I originally posted here because ""Cluckr"" asked if any one has any opinions about travelling to Oahu w/ children in the midst of a Coronavirus possible outbreak there.Well. It's pretty much every where by now in my OPINION.So "" Cluckr"", I recommend staying at home w/ your children so you do not have to breathe recirculated air on a big plane w/ others that you do not know or where they have been. Your children expect you to make good decisions for them.Take care."
What concerns me is one person spent a hour in a church in South Korea and now several hundred have tested positive. Meanwhile a couple spent a week (or greater) in Hawaii and “no one” has gotten it??? Based on everything we have learned thus far it would be extremely unlikely that no one else contracted the Virus in HI from that the couple. Too much at risk for Hawaii to admit or actually test ppl with 1 out of 4 ppl working in the tourist industry. My guess it’s wide spread everywhere at this point...
There is a lot of evidence that viruses of this type are transmitted less in warm climates. Just look it up on Google. Cold air keeps the virus active in the air and heat suppresses it to the ground.
"Now we know why Hawaii hasn’t reported any coronavirus infections even though numerous infected people seem to be identified after flying through the Honolulu airport: Hawaii hasn’t tested anyone yet.This admission is just stunning, considering that Hawaiian Airlines admitted several days ago that they flew an infected couple to Honolulu, and the husband was symptomatic before he took that flight.The strategy of health officials is quickly becoming abundantly obvious: Avoid reporting coronavirus infections by avoiding testing as many people as possible. After all, if no one is tested, no infections can be “confirmed.”"
"Your Wrong. No. you are wrong. No one in Hawai has have been tested! There are only 3 state that have test kit that work, samples where set to CDC no test results yet. You are too slow and out of date with your information Stop down playing the severity of this Global Crisis"
"Why are you shaming people who are using there brains to make a sensible decision with factualy information that's out, Not to Travel. Not travelling to a place that take 5 days to get results for CODIV-19. Is a sensible choice to madeAnd your wrong again the death rate is Not 2% the ""Current"" death is 10% has drop from 20% a week ago"
"Vacationer, nice first two posts. Who are you talking to? Every thing I have seen says the death rate is 2%. Where do you get 10-20? Do you live in Hawaii? Did you have plans on traveling to Hawaii in the future?"
"This may not relate .... but I just insured my Honolulu trip for late April/May. Almost no non-refundable costs. Bottom line was really low. Much, much lower than my other visits. Yet the bottom line insurance costs were a good 25% higher ... as I figure."
"Madison I had no clue about it, but that explains why there is such an outbreak in Northern Italy versus the south. The head of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Anthony Fauci) said: ""Coronaviruses are winter viruses. When the weather is warm and moist, these viruses don’t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry"".Inactivation of the virus is more rapid at warm climates and the whole process can be shorten from 28 to even 5 days. Hopefully that explains why there has been no new cases reported in Hawaii even though it's been over 2 weeks since the Japanese couple left the islands. Hopefully it stays that way as I really don't want to see more corona than the one I am currently sipping on my lanai.."
"Then how do you explain the cases and deaths in Singapore, Iran, and Korea, not to mention China?It's really sad to see the lack of critical thinking on this thread and in our world.Edited: 10:46 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Well Iran and Korea are both pretty cold in February. Can't say that about Singapore, that's for sure.. I guess warm weather can inhibit spreading of the virus but is not some bullet proof protection. Singapore being a major hub and fairly close to China obviously took a hit."
No idea where Vacationer is getting their numbers from - it’s right around 2.5%
"There is speculation that COVID19 is similar to influenza and some other viruses and could dissipate once temperatures rise and humidity increases. Perhaps, but at this point no one knows. Stephen Morse of Columbia University, an epidemiologist, influenza researcher and specialist on emerging infectious disease, says:“It’s possible, but it is wishful thinking, by analogy with flu and other winter respiratory viruses. I’d say wait until April, we’ll know then if it’s true.” [In the meantime, don't be] lulled by hopeful, but quite possibly wrong analogies.”"
"Herfnerd, the mortality rate has risen to 3.3%. Vacationer's rate is consistent with the proportion of patients with known outcomes...death vs. recovered... which is currently 9.5%."
"I’m travelling with 2 young kids to Oahu in late March. I’m monitoring the news but unless there’s some huge outbreak of cases. We are still going.I travel quite a bit so here’s a tip for everyone - Planes and Hotels are full of germs, bacteria and are not thoroughly cleaned. There’s lots of info on this if you google it. In case you are wondering what the dirtiest thing on the plane is.. it’s not the toilet seat. It’s usually the tray table or head rest!So when you travel, pack some anti-bacterial wipes:Plane - wipe down the seats, arm/head rests, tray table, screens.Hotel - wipe down everything you may touch and wear a pair of flip flops or slippers (dont go bare foot).Before eating - wash your hands!! Travel safe everyone!!"

"We are going to maui in may and have same concerns,especially since hawaii has no test kits yet, so there is no data on people that are volunteering to be quarantined. Are the infected?"

Good advice from John Y. We do the same Clorox wipes on the plane and in room. I also carry travel size Lysol spray for airplane bathrooms and spray the room. Good hand washing ( I worked in a hospital for 40yrs so it’s ingrained)hand sanitizers also. We often travel with our grandkids so I’m obsessive about this. We take zicam the 1st night and morning. Seems to work we haven’t been sick after traveling for quite a while. We just returned from Oahu everyone is healthy...can’t wait to return!
"We are going in March to Oahu, and this is mostly what concerns me now, as this virus evolves.. I am not so much worried about it being rampant on-island, but its the airports and traveling to and fro, which seem the most risky.Not sure how the CDC can upgrade the travel risk level to a 2 for Japan, Hong Kong & S. Korea, but the small airports of HI still have no flight restrictions from these areas that are rapidly becoming hotbeds for the virus?? I bet there are at least 100 flights a week from Asia still incoming.Lastly, with no test kits, and a notorious shortage of Dr.s, Hawaii seems ill-prepared to deal with a larger outbreak if that were to happen."
We are at HHV now and for the next 3 weeks. My sense it is probably the safest place in all of Oahu because of all the precautions being taken since the 2 infected visitors were here a couple weeks ago.
"I find it ""interesting"" that many of the most shrill posters on this thread created an account in February, and then have been exclusively posting conspiracies, inflammatory and fear-based content since then. Almost as if they work for a nation state troll farm.Then there are some posters who are ""real"" that are posting things that are not real, people like PracticeAloha808. I don't mean to be harsher than normal, but I'm not sure if it is mental illness, the need to be right, or just a low IQ coupled with no critical thinking skills, but NOBODY knows what the mortality rate is now, and people confidently proclaiming that it is 3.3% or whatever are full of it. While someone might have looked at the number of infections to the number of deaths, and calculated 3.3, every single scientist out there is saying that for every 1 case being counted there are likely 8-20 other unreported cases, so right there based on that metric you are looking at a mortality rate 8 to 20 times lower than 3.3% if that were even the ""right"" number. Typically the ""right"" number is published based on statistical analyses, surveys and other tools months or years after the outbreak passed as it is very time consuming and difficult to get that number.Edited: 2:50 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"I find it ""interesting"" that many of the most shrill posters on this thread have thousands of TA posts. Do you spend all of your time on TA? Whatever floats your boat I guess.

There are no reported anythings in MN. I feel they are lying. I am going to Maui...can't get there fast enough. I will be much safer there and hope that I can find a safe quiet spot on the beach.
"Kaeleku, this is a forum about traveling to Oahu, not Michigan. People like myself have plans to spend a lot of money to have a safe vacation in Oahu. I'm here to look for information on what's going on in Oahu (HHV) and also share information that I see is not here. Feel free to start a forum on Michigan if you would like to visit us. As you are in Maui and most likely not traveling to Oahu, I'm not sure why you are here. Why are you here?"
"Wait, you want to visit Hawaii? From Michigan, a place being devastated by COVID? Likely flying from Chicago, an international gateway with flights daily to Italy, Korea, and Japan?! I understand you reddies (""no collusion, no collusion!"") don't like blue states but resorting to biowarfare to kill us off is really underhanded.

I'm a bit nervous, but we really need a vacation, plus I would hate to walk away from $4k+ tickets and house rental costs.I'm not concerned with being on Oahu (San Diego isn't any safer), but am concerned about the flights. I almost always get sick when flying during the winter cold & flu season. (I originally thought I'd be better off flying to HNL than to Boston, lol.) I don't know if it will really help with Corona virus, since people will be breathing and coughing into the recirculated air, but I will wipe down our seat areas this time, and make sure everyone uses hand sanitizer or washes hands frequently. There is no way my 8 yo would tolerate a mask for 6 hours (or even 1)."
E-Rock...it was the FLU. Something we have been saying all along that people need to be worried over more at this point. Kay I wish you a wonderful trip. None of us know what will come with all of this. I intend to keep being careful..washing my hands etc... but I plan on continuing to live life and enjoy my March trip too.
"The hospitals on Oahu are busy now because of an unusually large flu prevalence, per this mornings paper."
"We are going in May. We've decided to wait and watch. Japan is called an ""ongoing"" outbreak by the state department (travel advisory level 2 now) and Hawaii gets 5,000 Japanese visitors a day, according to HNN report (2/24). So...if there is continued outbreak in Japan, then an outbreak in Hawaii is inevitable. We won't go if a significant outbreak develops."
Hawaii has a long way to go in terms of staffing to be ready for a large outbreak..just sayin.https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/hawa…
"Another tip on the hotel room - since I clean the room myself with antibaceterial wipes. I generally don't get the room cleaned (unless I am on an extended stay) since the cleaning lady will contaminate my room ( they wear gloves to clean which have touched other rooms).In the morning I give the cleaning lady my used towels, tip her a couple dollars and reload on towels and toiletries etc.."
"""Hawaii has a long way to go in terms of staffing to be ready for a large outbreak..just sayin."" But Hawaii also has a large military presence ... and medical specialties and staff that go with it.'And remember that just because folks go to the ER - does mean they are infected. Panic is bad on so many levels."
"I think BL meant just because people go to the ER ***DOESN'T **** mean they are infected.Yep, as Shanty and others have said, the flu season is a pretty big and bad one here. Add panic about COVID-19, no surprise that a small ER at a small hospital or two had trouble for a few hours.In the last week----More than 200 cases in Italy and 3 deaths; more than 60 cases in the mainland US; at least 12 deaths and who knows how many cases in Iran; over 800 cases and at least 7 deaths in S. Korea.Hawaii: O. No cases and no deaths. Stay home if you are worried. I'd rather people do that, than come here and be freaked out or obnoxious..........which yes, some already have been.If it weren't so darn far from me, I'd be booking a long trip to Italy in later March. Going to be some great bargains!Edited: 7:13 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"Typo above.......6 deaths in Italy, sorry!All the conspiracy folks need to go after Iran. There are multiple calls now for an investigation since their numbers don't ""add up""........maybe some of the posters here can go after that instead of Hawaii?"
"Iran is under embargo and can't get medical supplies or medication. It's been a problem for decades for the people there trying to get much-needed medicines and now in this crisis, it's just unbelievably cruel to witness."
"We arrived in Honolulu today. Our plane was completely full, and our hotel is full also. So it doesn’t appear that many travelers are staying home. There were some people at the Honolulu airport wearing face masks, though."
"Erock did you even read the article you posted? It says that people who have garden variety INFLUENZA but are worried about Coronavirus are straining hospital resources. “They have much more to be concerned about influenza than coronavirus,” according to the doc quoted.Me, I’m still headed to Big Island. As a precaution I plan to wear my mask and snorkel at all times both in and out of the water."
"We're going in March. I'm doing like most, monitoring it. And yes, I'm more worried about the 8.5 hour plane ride than actually being in Hawaii. But we will for sure do everything we can and know to do to stay safe. And most importantly, as we do with every trip, we'll ask the good Lord to keep his hand of protection upon us and keep us safe."
"The hand of god will not help you. Only a truly ignorant person would even say something like that. Washing your hands might help though, as would getting your information from a fact-based source."
Maybe if I go to Hawaii in a couple months I’ll be on a Covid-19 filled Max8 with snakes in the cargo hold.
"My family has a trip planned for Disney World in March. Considering it's high volumes of people and international tourists, we are a bit concerned. We haven't cancelled the trip yet, but considering it. Yes, so far it seems like a very low risk and we barely ever worry about the flu despite it being so dangerous. However, as you said, there is a lot we probably don't know about Coronavirus yet especially since much of the info is coming from China. It seems much worse (contagious / deadly) than the flu. When is the last time cities with millions of people were quarantined?"
"Yes but at the rate this is spreading, it is spreading much faster than the flu. Ask yourself when the last time, you have seen parts of Italy shut down? Or China shut down? Also, how do we know the "" Real numbers from this?""I guess it is the unknown that scares me.. It is uncharted territory. WE are also booked in late April, & have apprehensions. However, WE live near Orlando- & also see alot of tourist from all parts of the globe.. So it can happen here too. But neverthe less, the 13 hours on the Airplane is what nerves me the most about chances of getting sick. Most likely we are still going, but monitoring it daily."
OMG lovin'maui...my worst nightmare. The snakes that is LOL
"Hi guys, we just recently booked a vacation to Oahu (before we knew about the coronavirus), all the way from the Netherland, for late july (28th). Should we worry about our vacation?"
Worry about people from northern Italy now.
"are there penalties for canceling your ticket. You may consider booking a refundable hotel, if you are not sure.There are still a lot of unknowns with and if the virus will spread in the US. Currently, the test capability is limited. This is a link to a YouTube video on cnbc with the former fda commissioner talking about the coronavirus. https://youtu.be/Rel6TDmAnbE"
"Late July is too far out to say. If you haven't already, I would buy CFAR trip insurance now. It will be expensive but your only way to recoup nonrefundable expenses (if any of your plans are those).Italy, Iraq, S. Korea, and Japan are all fighting larger outbreaks--esp the first three countries. Some cases have also been noted in Spain, Austria, Croatia, and other previously unaffected areas."

"Yep, I agree, Kaeleku.Still glad I'm in Hawaii and not the mainland. I think my chances are better for NOT getting it here."
Had trip planned for next week at Sheraton Wikiii. Have decided tocancel trip. Not worth the risk.
We have a trip next week. Staying at Hilton Hawaiian Village. We are still going. We don’t see any risk.
Probably the riskiest thing about your trip was showing up in Hawaii and realizing there is no town of Wikiii.
Our trip is in three weeks - still planning on going

"My family of 3 have stayed at Aulani during Spring Break in March 3 times, and it’s hard not to notice that at least 1/3 of the patrons during that time of the year are Koreans. Since the Disney Resorts in China and Hong Kong are basically closed due to the threat of the virus, I’m wondering if that won’t increase the odds of someone from these areas to end up getting their Disney fix in Aulani ... anyone else feel like minded?"
"What if it does?Your post says, lots of Koreans before, could there be more?Put down the dog whistle and own what you’re saying."
"Considering the suspension of flights from China to Hawaii and with the increase of COVID-19 in Korea, I think you will see less people from China/HongKong/ROK and those that do come will be scrutinized pretty closely"
Here are some NEWS:Hawaii doctors flagged 8 for coronavirus symptoms; none tested https:/…Still no test kits in https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/schat…
"Hawaii is finally urging residents to take steps to prepare for the potential spread of the coronavirus, including by having a 14-day kit of emergency supplies at home. Do the resorts have 14-day stock of supplies for each and every guest? And there is also this....still no testing. https:/…"
"Family fun, the article says it turned out none of the patients met the criteria for testing. So what is your point?"
"No town of Wikiii. WHAAAAAT!!! Say it isnt so!! Just had to be a typo. But the reply made me LAUGH!! Thanks for that!Edited: 9:11 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Article also said that all states are sending their samples to the CDC for testing. That implies no states have their test kits at this time.Also, being prepared when you live in the most isolated island chain on the planet is a good idea. We have our ""hurricane"" kit ready to go year round. Earthquakes happen too.No hotels that I know of will be prepared to take care of guests for an extended amount of time."
"Herfnerd, There may be suspended flights from China, but they are still coming in from Japan. And anyone can connect thru Japan to go to Hawaii.And now a flight attendant has come down with the virus (Seoul to LAX). You have to wonder about how much they are in danger with having to serve and pick up after so many people. That is actually my biggest worry... flying for so many hours on a plane so cramped in with so many people. Still in holding pattern to see where this all goes.In the meantime, we have our N95 masks and will get our 14 day kits together."
"Hey, so I live on Oahu about 10 min. from Waikiki and have for all 28 years of my life. My mother works at the HHV front desk in Ali'i tower. The infected couple actually stayed at the Hiltons time share tower which is on the side of the HHV property. The couple definitely brought it here from Japan, as they began feeling symptoms shortly after arriving on Maui. They say the man wore a mask the entire time he was here. This man had not previously traveled to China, and this leads me to my 1st point in how flawed Hawaiis response to corona has been. As of today 2/26/20, NOT 1 PERSON HAS EVEN BEEN TESTED!! Several samples were submitted by Hawaii Drs. Who suspected cases of Corona, and health officials threw those samples out because ""they didnt meet the criteria for testing"" what was this criteria? None of the patients had traveled to China... now on top of this, The testing kits sent here from the CDC were somehow sent to the wrong state a few weeks ago, then after they were forwarded here they all arrived destroyed and unusable... so kits arent expected to arrive here until mid march... it is very clear to me that considering our heavy flow of Asian tourists and other travelers from all over the world, I can guarantee you that there are multiple cases of Corona here in Hawaii, and there are a lot of people who are controlling the narrative to avoid families from canceling or postponing their trips here. Most of my family relies on the tourism industry for our livelihood, but I would much rather have to deal with a recession than have beautiful families like yours be tricked into coming to a dangerous environment with an invisible enemy designed to harm us. POSTPONE THE TRIP!!! DONT LET THE GREED OF OTHERS CAUSE YOU TO PUT YOUR FAMILY AT RISK. THE SIMPLE FACT THAT CARRIERS ARE CONTAGIOUS BEFORE THEY EVEN HAVE SYMPTOMS, IS WHY THE WHOLE WORLD IS ADMITTING THAT THERE IS NO STOPPING THIS, SO WHAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF IS TO HOLD OFF ON TRAVEL, AND AVOID CROWDED PLACES UNTIL THINGS CALM DOWN. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST A MONTHS FOOD SUPPLY FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. THE FRUSTRATING PART IS THAT SIMPLE SELFLESSNESS WOULD HAVE CUT THIS VIRUS OFF. IF ANYONE WHO HAD EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF CONTRACTING IT (RECENT TRAVEL TO CHINA OR CONTACT W/SOMEONE WHO HAS) ACTED AS IF THEY MAY HAVE HAD IT AND DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO NOT SPREAD GERMS, THEN WE WOULD NOT BE FACING THIS. THE MOST FRUSTRATING OF CASES BEING THE WOMAN WHO GAVE IT TO 500+ MEMBERS OF HER CHURCH AFTER REFUSING TO BE TESTED TWICE."
"It has been reported that wearing just a mask (even the N95) is only helpful for those who are infected and want to ""limit"" transmission to others. If you wish to have protection from being infected in a confined space, then you should wear a N95 mask along with air tight goggles. Aerosol COVID-19 transmission though exposed mouth, nose and eyes. I heard a suggestion to wear your swim goggles with N95 mask if you must fly. I understand that this sounds crazy....just passing along the info."
"That is not my idea of how to start a vacation. If our trip to Hawaii was soon, wr would go. Since it's in June, I expect we won't because unless warm weather kills it off, it will be community based all over mainland by then."
"After the news reports my wife saw last nite, she is now on the fence about going in three weeks. Unless I see something drastically change, I'm still all for going. Her biggest concern is stopping stopping at LAX outbound and DFW inbound. I mentioned that Bradley Int'l at LAX is separate from the domestic terminials. DFW is a different story....."
"People are focusing waaaaaayyyyyy too much on China/Korea/Japan IMO.Folks--this is ALL OVER. Oh, not yet in Antarctica--so *almost* all over.Iran is a huge problem, as I've said many times. You don't really believe they are telling the truth, do you? And how about the people in Canada that were infected IN IRAN......and the growing number of cases there? Canada has pre-clearance for many US airports, and many people also drive over the border and fly domestically (within the US). People can fly to NY from Italy-or France, Switzerland, Spain, Russia, Croatia, Japan, Germany, Austria, etc., etc.--and then get on a domestic flight or two to Hawaii or anywhere else. So thinking being in ""domestic"" terminals is no cure or preventative measure, sorry.Again--this is def going to spread. If you are generally healthy and don't have an impaired immune system--and aren't an elderly (like 75 or more) male---you have a very low risk of death or serious illness, by ALL THE VALIDATED NUMBERS.Sorry to shout some. But people need to take some deep breaths and consider that they are very probably more likely to get the virus in the mainland than Hawaii."
"This is regularly updated showing where cases arehttps:/…So keep looking for Italians, Finns, etc. Or ask if anybwere on your plane or at near the person sitting near you on the connecting flight..."
"Or from Nassau County, New York........home of 83 people (down from 175) who are quarantined.Borders are a myth in today's world. They are lines drawn by man, signifying nothing to nature or disease. Thanks to travel and the long incubation period for some people with the virus, this was spreading well before most countries knew it, IMO.I wish our governor was less a muppet and more a man. Instead of asking for Federal money and/or declaring a state of emergency (like many states have today).....he's going to raid OUR accounts for the same things other states are getting aid for. Greaaaaaatttt."
"Exactly, it’s important to remember that those that died were elderly patients with significant pre-existing conditions. That does not diminish the tragedy, but for sure adds some context. The vast majority of infected people manifest only slight symptoms and recover at home.I personally think we should fully anticipate that in the next month or so every state will have some infected persons. But that does not necessarily create an insurmountable problem, as long as the numbers remain small. I live on Oahu, my husband works at HHV and walks few times a day in the building where the Japanese couple stayed. Although we monitor situation closely, we are not stressing out. At least not in a current situation. For the comparison, there is 100 people in the US alone that die in car accidents every day. Does it mean I should be panicking every time I am in the car? Or perhaps try to drive as rarely as possible. Well I sure don't. Even though the odds are way higher I die in a car crash than from the virus.. So at the end of a day people need to decide what their comfort level is. What is the point in spending thousands of $ just to give yourself anxiety ? If you know you will be that person, that by all means cancel your vacation and stay home. Just keep in mind that next year or so there might and probably will be some new strain of virus."
"No one in this thread can tell you what is going on. I understand that you have people that live in this region and they are proud, but they don't know either. Do your own research and come to an outcome on your risks. No one can tell you what is right for your family.I just wish some people would stop making the situation seem like a joke."
"None of us who live in Hawaii are joking about this......here or in any other thread. But most of us are also not going batshoot crazy and posting in all caps.Yes--like I and many, many others have said--each person's risk tolerance is different. Each person has to make the best decision for *them*. But that decision should be based on more than foil hats and faux news.If people would read more and understand the true scope of this, they'd see why I and a few others get frustrated at the harping on Hawaii. Many of them come from areas that have had and still do have more cases, and much higher risk. But for various reasons, Hawaii gets all the un-fun."
"Just to correct the statistics on #290, the odds dying if you get infected with the virus is exponentially (like a millon times) higher than the odds of dying in a car. Can you imagine if 2 or 3 percent of people died from riding in a car?"
"""Probably the riskiest thing about your trip was showing up in Hawaii and realizing there is no town of Wikiii.""Made Patti laugh! Not me and certainly not the person you replied to.Nothing wrong with a typo or someone cancelling their trip due to this virus!This virus is real! This virus is in many countries! This virus is on cruise ships where air is circulated.Air is circulated on planes!This is a virus that kills about 1 in every 50 that is affected with the virus.Travelers are quarantined for a couple of weeks if the virus is even suspected!I don't think a misspelling of Waikiki is risky or funny in this instance."
"Well, I'm curious as to where in Northern CA this person is from. It's a MASSIVE region ... cities, towns, mountains, valleys, high desert ... rugged coastline. Lots of super LOW population density (rural) areas - but metro areas, too. Or the Northern CA reference could well be the Bay Area. Hmmm ...And, because I know you are really interested in this - every county, and a handful of cities, has its own public health department ... as well as the big-mama State Department of Public Health.Edited: 10:34 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"""Just to correct the statistics on #290, the odds dying if you get infected with the virus is exponentially (like a millon times) higher than the odds of dying in a car.""Perhaps I am reading this wrong!But the odds of dying if one gets infected with this disease is 1 in 50!Odds of anyone dying in a car accident is about 1 in 6000 in a year and about 1 in 75 in a lifetime.www.asktheodds.com/death/car-crash-odds/I do agree that the odds if getting infected with coronavirus right now in the U.S. is perhaps way less than one getting killed in a car accident in the U.S. What about a week from now? What about a month from now?Flights to destinations and cruise ships to destinations are being canceled."
Hawaii also has Department of Health divisions on each island.
"#293. The chance of dying if you get Covid19 is 2-3% but my chance of getting Covid19 as I travel to Hawaii presently is extremely low. In fact I believe I have more of a chance of dying as I drive to the airport, fly to Hawaii, swim in the ocean, climb Koko head, or drive on H3 than I have a chance of getting Covid19. That may change in the next few weeks or months. So in 4 days I will be in Hawaii with no worries."
"Dusty, you read it correctly. The odds of dying if you have COVID-19 is much higher than dying in a car."
I suggest that people don't inject politics into this forum. Trump haters and supporters have plans to travel to Hawaii.
"But Dusty is right. It's just facts - right off the evening news. And it shouldn't make us feel any better.Edited: 10:55 pm, February 26, 2020 "
