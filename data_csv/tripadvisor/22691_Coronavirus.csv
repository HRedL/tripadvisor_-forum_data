What are you going to do? Live your life in fear or just enjoy your holiday. Nowhere is completely safe. Take general hygiene precautions and enjoy your holiday
What does your Government advise ?
"Darren P, Take general hygiene precautions That’ will be a big problem for some visiting from very unhygienic countries..Edited: 9:09 am, February 01, 2020 "
"Jasmeet, where are you coming from?Do you know how many people have died from this virus in Thailand.....that’s right, exactly ZERO."
"Zero is very deceptive.................remember, 1 person has contracted the virus, out of the 69+ million living here.Surely Thailand is very unsafe right now......better cancel.Edited: 10:40 am, February 01, 2020 "
"Why would you expect to get high quality accurate advice on whether it’s safe to travel from random unqualified strangers on the internet? If you’re concerned about coronavirus, you should make your travel decisions based on medical advice from a doctor, official government travel advisories and alerts from the World Health Organisation. If you get any advice other than “speak with your doctor” you should ignore that advice."
"WHO ... a jokeGov't ... yea, trust worthy ... 555Doc on traveling .... you need shots, lots of shots...$$$$$"
"Hi JasmeetThe only absolute fact is that nobody knows the answer to your question. You need to do all the research others are doing, then take that enormous leap of making up your own mind. I realise you’re not used to doing that, but in this situation, it would not be wise for anybody else to make your decision for you."
The Coronavirus death toll has now risen to 304 in China.
"Happy not to be in or going to China then.304 of 1.4 billion people of China, or the 7.7 trillion people on the planet..................not worried yet. Let me know when it gets to 1 mill"
"NotMe - the World Health Organisation is “a joke”. Ok then. You’d have to trawl TA far and wide to find a more risible comment than that. There’s something very dangerous about conspiracy theorist halfwits on here providing medical advice and being blissfully confident doing so. No doubt you’re an anti-vaxxer to boot.Edited: 11:50 am, February 04, 2020 "
NotMe - do you actually believe there’s 7.7 Trillion people on the planet??
oops....brain fartBillion....as you already know....555
"WHO is a joke. Just another self serving organization. People with titles, living the high life on tax money and Big Pharma donations..........it's a joke.Besides an arm for Big Pharm pushing FTA that hurt those that need healthcare and meds the most.Here's a fine example, before Chan left the WHO: ""The World Health Organization (WHO) may be spending more on staff travel than on major public health initiatives such as AIDS or malaria, according to internal documents.The documents, obtained by the Associated Press, revealed that the strapped U.N. health agency spends about $200 million annually on travel than what is allotted individually for primary health issues. In 2016, for instance, WHO spent around $71 million on AIDS and hepatitis, and $61 million on malariaWHO director-general Margaret Chan was criticized for staying in the largest presidential suite at the Palm Camayenne, a hotel located in Conakry. The suite is advertised to cost travelers $1,008 per night.WHO was quick to say that Chan’s overnight stays cost the same as those of other WHO travelers — 212 euros, or about $240. Yet they declined to comment on who or what office paid for the suite, and said that host countries sometimes pay for accommodations.Chan spent more than $370,000 in travel in one year, as outlined in a classified 25-page analysis of WHO expenses identifying the agency’s top 50 spenders.""Edited: 7:02 am, February 02, 2020 "

"#17...Corona is certainly a convenient distraction for Thailand in that it has kept dangerous air quality off the front pages for the last couple of weeks. More will die in Thailand as a result of bad air quality this year than from Coronavirus I'll bet you.Edited: 7:27 am, February 02, 2020 "

The Coronavirus death toll has now risen to 425 and is accelerating.
"13 minutes later...........+ 2 moreWhen it hits 50 a day...in Thailand, matching road deaths, I'll start to be concerned.Until then, seems to be a China problem. Which they always seem to have."
It’s a Global problem because of the amount of Aircraft and other means of transport that are travelling around the World everyday moving the virus around the planet on infected people.
"Not really, it's a China problem. Number of cases outside of China, haven't increased much in the last few days.Far from 'global problem'.....unless something drastically changes. Not really expected IMOEdited: 7:44 am, February 04, 2020 "
"Just looked, less than 200 cases outside of China, and 90 % or more, are from China.More people died in scooter accidents here last week, is that a Global problem.Few new cases, anywhere worth mentioning. It appears to have been contained outside of China.A lot of drama for nothing. And all of 1 person has died outside of China............STOP THE PRESSES."
"Based on your figures, Loki, surely there might be a few people out there who would begin to agree with me that this is a media driven storm in a teacup."
"#26, media driven storm in a teacup ! The Death Toll is now 490 and the virus is spreading globally ! No Tourist Destinations around the World will want to admit that the virus is in the resort or city, they will all try to keep Quiet and Cover it up !Edited: 6:19 am, February 05, 2020 "
"Apparently they are reporting, and far from a Global problem.When death count outside of China, matches at least the number of people killed by lightning a year, I might start to pay attention.That's 2000 - 6000 a year ... as apparently nobody cares about accurate numbers.""About 240,000 incidents regarding lightning strikes happen each year. Annual fatality tolls vary greatly. One estimate is that the annual global death toll is 6,000. On the other hand, according to National Geographic, annually about 2,000 people are killed worldwide by lightning.""One thing for sure, seems a good time to go out and about and explore Thailand, as the crowds of tourist, are non existent.Richard Barrow twitter showing easy strolling through Ratchad RR market, along with 300 buses parked in Phuket for weeks already, and speedboats lining the coast idle."
The Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 killed an estimated 20 Million People all around the World in one year then it totally disappeared ! The virus may have landed on planet Earth on a meteorite ? and SARs and Coronavirus may have done so too ? NASA knows numerous types of bacteria are growing in space on the outside of International Space Station.

"Don’t want to worry anyone but there is an article in the Daily Mail on 6th Feb - Have 'real' coronavirus death figures been leaked? China's second-biggest company momentarily list death toll at 24,589 but quickly changes to official numbers, sparking wild conspiracy theories !!!"
Quoting the DailyMail........nobody will be alarmed.
Ostriches bury their Heads in the Sand and hope the problem goes away !
Basic hygiene Wash hands You can also carry antibacterial hand wash its cheap. In Pattaya at the moment antibacterial handwashing is in the mauls even in McDonald's. Also in crowded places face masks should be worn. Doesn't matter if people are from unhygienic countries. No excuse not to take precautions here
Jasmeet S.Check your temperature lately?
The Coronavirus death toll has now risen to 722 and an American has died from the virus who was working in China.
"Does anyone care that doesn't know them.4+ million will die this month somewhere, I don't care about them either."
"Just wet back from Pattaya, been there from 5 to 7th Feb 2020.AFAIK no case reported at Pattaya yet. No China tourist and all flight from China has been banned and China passport holder will be extra scan and denied from enter Thailand.All good, Less people except at Walking Street."
‘ and all flight from China has been banned ’Wrong !!!
"Ok, Maybe not all flight.But did not see any China passport holder. For me it should be safe..For me, Pattaya is not the issue. Being long time in flight and transit between airport is a big deal. To many people there. And stuck in flight with few hundred people within few hours. It will be bad if 1 of the passenger affected. but thermal screen will detect them while boarding and arriving."
"‘ Ok, Maybe not all flight.’Wrong again. Thailand has not banned any Chinese flights !!"
"There are over 100,000 Chinese tourists in Thailand. Thailand has 615 suspected cases awaiting results. So what happens to all the ones who have a temperature? With the long incubation period it will not catch everyone. Of course having a temperature does not mean you have this virus."
Isn't it amazing how the Chinese started this virus. A Thai minister has stated they are not stopping flights from China but said western visitors who are not waring face masks should be kicked out of Thailand. If that's not racist then what is. Lots of thai people are not wearing masks and lots of Chinese but farangs should be kicked out. What a joke
"@DarrenP, I’m still in Koh Chang and not seen anyone wearing masks and only seen about 10 Chinese.. it’s lovely here. I’m back in Pattaya on 22nd.. are many wearing masks there? When I left a week ago I’d say about 30% were wearing them."
"I have been in Pattaya two weeks and must say feel safe and very healthy. Not many Chinese people here now. The weather has been beautiful nice breeze, sunshine all day. The people wearing masks are locals serving the public in shops, 7/11 and Big C etc. Not all people are wearing masks due to the Coronavirus. Some will wear due to existing health issues and normally Feb/March are the months when the air quality is not that great."
"Hi lisa yes a lot more are wearing them. Unfortunately I picked the wrong place to stay as I'm at the base and the majority of people staying here are Chinese. I have spent the last 3 days in bed I'll with a fever. Probably just a cold. Supposed to be going to kho larn today but have to cancel. Motalaw the place is full of Chinese dont know where you are looking.Edited: 3:14 am, February 11, 2020 "
"Cant say I have seen any but I am well away from the touristy parts and the beach. Heading for Vietnam on Friday so that mean going through Suvarnabhumi and the risks that involves. Might purchase a mask. I arrived here end of January full of cold, and the winter blues but it didn't take long here to lose it.Edited: 9:25 am, February 11, 2020 "
"Lisa M a lot more people wearing facemasks now so there is actually a shortage, Aksorn School where our daughter goes gave them out for the air pollution some weeks ago as did Bali Hi pier so can be used fir the Coronavirus. Still some doubts about have effective they are.."
