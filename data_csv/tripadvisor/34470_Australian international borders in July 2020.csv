"Good afternoon!I've have a flight already booked from Europe to Sydney, departing on 25 July 2020 and returning to Europe in Mid-AugustDo you think is there any chance Australia will open up again to international tourists by July?Thanks!"
"Not likely in my opinion but if at all it would depend from where in Europe and also 14 day quarantine on arrival would most likely be required, but I think July would be not happening at this stage."
no
Here's the site setting out the restrictions on entry -https:/…coming-australia
"Maybe be to people from New Zealand, but otherwise no."
I wish I had a moire positive answer but I doubt borders will reopen for international tourists this year.
Highly unlikely
Not a chance.Have you checked the covid policy for the airline you’re booked with. You may have to wait a other o this or so before you can do anything about your flights. Don’t cancel though unless the airline is allowing that. It’s better to wait to see if they cancel.Hope you didn’t use one of the many cheap ticket floggers to book.
"""Do you think is there any chance Australia will open up again to international tourists by July?""You've got a snowball's chance in hell, mate. And I don't need my crystal ball for those odds."
"I also have a flight in July and I can easily get a full refund with Singapore Airlines. However, before cancelling, I wanted to be sure that chances to come in July in Australia were close to zeroHave you already read the below? Do you think it will include all passengers travelling through Singapore?https://www.executivetraveller.com/news/aust…Edited: 2:01 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"TravellerfromEurope, no, that wouldn’t include transit passengers from other countries, they’re talking about potential travel by Singaporeans, as their country has low Covid numbers that are getting under control. It’s all about your country of origin at the moment, as that’s where the risk lies. All these travel bubbles and air bridges are still entirely speculation though, the logistics of which will take months and months to implement. There is zero chance any travelers from Europe or the US will be allowed here within the next few months, most likely not even this year without a significant quarantine period also being required."

We are scheduled to fly to Australia for our holiday in late November and being from the USA I don't think there is a snowball's chance in hell that we will be visiting. Even if my Aussie friends would consider letting me in their country with no quarantine I'm sure that there will be some type of screening that takes place at immigration. I'm not flying for 15 hours across the Pacific Ocean only to risk that they gun my forehead at immigration and I have a fever. Then what do I do? They aren't going to let me back on a plane to go home so I'll likely spend the next 14 days quarantined at my own expense. I'm not doing any international travel until the Covid is basically gone.
"I think the chances of people from other Australian states being allowed to visit Queensland in July are slim. The chances of internationals being allowed in by then are zero, and being allowed in this year at all are close to zero.I know every country wants to get their tourist dollars happening again, and every country would be happy for Aussies and Kiwis to come visiting soonest given how low our covid figures are. But why would we want to encourage international visitors when we have 285 cases (most of which are from international travellers) and 4 deaths per million of population and some European countries have over 4000 cases and 500 deaths per million??Edited: 6:05 pm, May 31, 2020 "

"""Google Australia smart travel.""Hey leileis, I did, and there's no list."
"Leileis can you please post the link to your source for 2022 and the “list” you’re referring to?It’s fine if this is just your opinion.we all have different opinions on what governments may do down the line, we just shou,dnt e portraying opinions as facts. As I understand it there haven’t been any decisions at all yet on opening international borders."

It won’t do Australia’s international reputation much good long term if this outright ban on foreigners goes on for a prolonged period. I had been hoping to visit next year but understand it’s going to be 2022
"Every day arrivals into Sydney are identified as having Covoid (yesterday there were 6 cases) hence the borders are closed to overseas visitors. This is how it will be for this year and hopefully in 2021 borders are opened.PS Ireland has 1,600 deaths and 5,000 Covoid cases per million population - Australia has 100 total deaths and 280 cases per million. Locked down borders work."
"I agree. Our reputation will be enhanced rather than harmed because of the way we have handled the virus.BRNZ, can I come to Mt Cook with you? That is my favourite place in NZ. Amazing hiking/scenery."
"Just agreeing with others that the way Australia has handled covid will enhance our reputation and (in the long term) probably make Australia and NZ a more appealing holiday destination.Queensland has now opened up for travel within the state (we already have holidays being planned for upcoming school holidays across Queensland) but that can only be done safely at the moment as there is no international travel. As other countries get a hold of covid, I am sure borders will reopen."
