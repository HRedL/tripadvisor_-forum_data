"The Ha'penny Bridge is one of the most enduring symbols of Dublin City. It's nearly 200 years old (1816) and a protected structure. In the last two year Dublin City Council have had to remove hundreds of padlocks from the bridge on two separate occasions. They are unsightly and cause damage. On Saturday when I was walking over the bridge I heard two tourists complaining that someone had ""removed all the love locks from the love lock bridge"" I find it really upsetting that this beautiful structure has become nothing more that a hanging place for lumps of metal and that it's two hundred year history has been forgotten, it seems even it's name has been robbed! The two people in question were genuinely upset that the locks were removed and couldn't figure out why someone would have done such a thing! I'm appealing to all visitors to the city and locals alike not to partake in this destructive practice. There is nothing romantic about your lock being cut off by a bolt cutter, is there? I have some pictures of the locks and the damage done here: http://flic.kr/s/aHsjGxQrf5"
"Hear hear Lolly. Do you know when did all of this love lock stuff start and why ? I don't recall it happening a few years ago, its seems to be a recent enough thing."
"Sorry ma'lord, ....didn't they used to hang people from the bridge too..??"
As far as I can figure out dubfam it started around 2010/2011. I recall the locks being removed in January 2012 but there weren't as many that time as there were last week. thejournal.ie/wheres-the-love-council-remove… My understanding of it is that it's something you do when you are traveling abroad so hence why I am asking/begging here that tourists don't do it. I know it's become common place in cities like Paris and Prague. The local councils in these cities have even specially adapted the bridges to accommodate locks. I hope Dublin City Council can do something similar here but just not with the Ha'penny Bridge.
"Hi Cavan, I have no knowledge of anyone ever being hanged off the Ha'penny Bridge. (Doesn't mean it didn't happen but I honestly don't think so ... )"
"Perhaps it is not tourists, maybe it is people having to emigrate from this sad place just leaving something behind them as a token of their hope of returning some day.Didn't they do away with public hanging some time ago........pity!!Edited: 7 years ago "
"Well put, Lolly. @dubfam - I think the practice was imported from Paris, where several bridges on the Seine are festooned with thousands of rusting locks. I heard one just-wed English couple interviewed on radio, who said that they had come to Dublin especially to attach their lock, as the prcatice is ""not allowed in the UK"". Did it never occur to them to ask why it is not allowed? Interesting that the vast majority of those interviewd in the radio piece were foreign touristsEdited: 7 years ago "
"Hey soonas, I'm pretty sure it's one of those things you ""do when travelling"" I seriously worry about the mentality behind something like this ... I mean, it's 200 years old for fecks sake!!! I dunno, maybe I should initiate some public hangings from the bridge!!! :) Grrrrrrr .... I get soooooo mad when I think about it!"
Is it best to attach my lock before or after my sheep trail tour of Ireland? What are people wearing while attaching locks this year? Can I get here by public transport or do I need to hire a car?
"Ah, lightblue7, thanks for the laugh, you've lowered my blood pressure! You can para-glide in so long as you're not wearing white sneakers ..."
"I'd love to find ""Mertie"" (or maybe ""Bertie"") who felt the need to leave their name and the year carved into a wall on Dunluce Castle I saw last week. Maybe it's time to bring back the hangings..."
"Oh my god Irishfan, gobshites plain and simple! Who goes to an 800 year old monument with the intention of defacing it? Hanging's too good for them, bring back flogging! :)"
"as far as I am aware, the ""tradition"" started in china, where locks were attached to wire handrails on the great wall, to ensure your memory remained.but yes, it is a spreading eyesore. it was mentioned on radio the other day, that as the bridge is very old and made of cast iron, the locks being made of hardened steel are actually damage the ironwork. to preserve the bridge and its aesthetics, the locks are being removed, not that any of those who put them there will ever be back to check!"
"Thanks for sharing that bit about it's origin nakagoli, good to know!"
"Trying to deal with our indigenous vandals and litter louts is difficult enough without visitors deciding to have a go. Can't believe those people called it the love lock bridge either. Idiots! Good on ya Lolly for bringing this issue to the fore, I had no idea of the extent of it."
Look like it's an epidemic…wikipedia.org/wiki/…Ireland
"I suppose if people really do want to engage in this brainless activity, it would be a good idea to provide them with some sort of structure and a lot of sentimental guff surrounding it to fix their locks on. In fact if someone set up a little kiosk selling locks they could create a job for themself!Maybe a metal rainbow with curved bars, and a couple of leprechauns."
If you look on any of the other forums Paris has an on going problem The Ponte Veccio in Italy you can now be charged for putting locks on it Malta is the same now.In Russia they have metal trees where you hang your lock and it is scrapped every six months.I prefer hand cuffs and ropes and am not sure what you do when she dumps you do you go back to Italy with a hacksaw and cut the lock off and where do you store that stupid key yes Lolly you are correct a total eyesore.
"It's nothing new. I was ""locked"" on The Halfpenny Bridge many a time in my Dublin youth"
And by that he means drunk and going home by rail.
"""going home by rail"" - love it!"
"doneraile. the shops already sell these locks and also engrave them for you, both in Dublin and anywhere else in the world."
"Well said Lolly. The deliberate destruction of the emblem of the city by these knuckleheads is a disgrace. Whatever happened to ""take only photographs; leave only footprints""?Anyone know if the Ha'penny Bridge is a National Monument? If so the maximum penalty for defacing it is a fine of €10 million or 5 years in prison under Section 5 of the National Monuments Act 2004. Perhaps somebody should be made an example of....Edited: 7 years ago "
"It is in the care of the City Council, so maybe falls outside the scope of the 2004 Act"
"The city council refer to it as a ""protected structure"" rather than a national monument."

Maybe that's why they put the bridge in front of Merchants Arch.
Defacing a public structure is unacceptable.
"It's irrelevant whether the lock is attached to a protected structure or just a plain old common-or-garden fence. It is vandalism/littering and should be dealt with as such by the authorities (it probably is already)The only way to stop this practice, is for Dublin Corpo to remove any new locks on a daily basis. People will soon stop doing it when they realise that purchasing the lock is only a waste of time and money as it will not remain on the bridge for very long."
"unfortunately the people who do put these locks on the bridge are not repeat offenders. they are one-off offenders who will never be on the bridge again, so they cannot be deterred."
Dublin Corpo wont clean the streets on a daily basis never mind take locks off a bridge unless it is on Saturday or Sunday with overtime and double overtime that way they can be off sick the rest of the week and still get paid more.
"Think I'll invest in a set of bolt cutters and remove them meself. Would be fun to cut one as soon as someone has attached it.Lolly I think you'll need to set up some sort of Faceb**k ""campaign"" to get the message out there. Seems to be the only way the young people operate these days."
"It would be good if DCC would cut all locks off over the space a a few weeks so as to send the message that it isn't the love lock bridge but I really don't think they have the resources. Facebook is a good idea, hadn't thought of that!"
wow! I had not realised that this was a forum for slagging off Dublin corporation and criticising their workers!
One must take what opportunities one gets did you say workers or Employees.
Great to see so much humour displayed here at the expense of the locksmith or Dublin Corpo. The truth is what with all the metal being lifted around the country by opportunist thieves out looking to make a few bob from the scrap merchants. Putting a few locks on one of Dublin's most iconic bridges is not such a bad idea afterall as you never know who will lift them.Edited: 7 years ago 
"Brings a whole new meaning to when someone says ""you've stolen my heart..."" lol."
"thejournal.ie/hapenny-bridge-love-locks-hack…Great to see another source removing the locks. Please visitors, do not engage in this practice"
"Wonderful! Great to see people with such a sense of civic pride. How, though, to stop the idiots attaching the locks in the first place?"
a bean. we certainly don't want the ha'penny bridge turned into a forest!
"Bean, sounds like you have the plan down! Hmmm...I could really use a new job (as could DH) Maybe our calling has been found! :-)"
Puts a whole new meaning to gettin' locked!
"A load of new age hippy romanticism.Its basically defacing our city.Im going to Haiti next month,and will have no interest in leaving a stupid bleeding padlock attached to some local structure.Ridiculous.Sparky."
"And what have dublin city council done to address the beggars that sit on the bridge? It would take nothing but recognition, understanding and patience to deal with the city beggars. It's laughable that they whinge more about a bridge than recognise the lifestyles of the people who live around it. Old rusty monuments come before people.....nice!"
We have a decent social welfare system in this country. We also have professional beggars. We have some pretty bad people running the corridors of power. We also have some good caring people. A mixed bag like anywhere else really.
"Ok, I've changed the Wikipedia reference to try and deter the clowns who think this is a good idea. Perhaps similar threads on other travel forums might help too."
"I've seen this all over the world and it's clearly something that tourists will do. Rather than holding tourists accountable and writing about it on a forum why not write to DCC and ask them to create a tourist amenity. It could be an area in the city where the council want to attract tourists or better still create an area on the new Rosie Hackett Bridge for this activity. Stick a sign next to each side of The Hapenny Bridge warning that the locks damage the bridge and will be removed. Perhaps a warning of an on the spot fine and direct tourists to the area where this amenity is created. Personally I like these locks if they are put in the right place as they give a tourist an opportunity to leave a memory and perhaps return years later to see it, it's the modern version of carving your name in a tree! I do agree they are not suitable for the Hapenny Bridge but that doesn't mean that it cannot be facilitated. Removing them regularly creates an ongoing cost and is akin to brushing it under the carpet and hoping it will go away, having discussions on local radio and in national news papers will not influence tourists as they are not likely to access our media. With that in mind in the absence of signs on the bridge blaming the tourists who more than likely do not understand the damage they are causing is unfair.. You can stand around and talk about these things or you can do something about it :)"
"Hi Hungry! I, and many others, have broached the subject with DCC. No concrete decision has been made by them. I like your suggestion for the Rosie Hackett, I'll definitely suggest that at the next opportunity... though I do prefer Bean's idea more!!! :)"
"Surely the fact that some people use the bridge as something so special it makes it a beautiful sight, those locks could be something attracting tourists to Dublin- ever since the same bridge was seen in hollyoaks with ste and Brendan! I think it's a beautiful site with the locks, a sense of creating a new history with the bridge that will follow on with the old history and traditions!❤️"
"Sorry Emily, but I can't see the appeal of a ton of ironmongery cluttering the lines of the bridge, not to mention the damage the locks do to the old ironwork. And since I have no idea who Ste and Brendan are, and have only vaguely heard of Hollyoaks, that angle isn't going to convince me!"
"Emily. what on earth is special about putting a lock on a bridge? the bridge was designed to be without locks, so why can people not leave it without locks?I doubt that you would be happy to see locks on british heritage sites. would you like to see them on the railings of Buckingham palace?"
"These locks are vandalism, no more than that."

I am SERIOUSLY Not going to travel all the way to Dublin to look at a pile of rusty old padlocks disfiguring an architecturally beautiful bridge.Beautiful sight : noVandalism : yes!
"They should set up a ""railing"" somewhere where people could attach locks, perhaps a hardware shop or locksmith would sponsor this. This ""railing"" would be designed to be easily dismantled so the locks could be periodically removed."
Gaelflyer they did that in Singapore and it seem to work over there.... maybe it's more the fact that the penalties for leaving these locks anywhere else could be quite harsh....Never gonna happen here I'm afraid.
"'get your locks heeya, two for one the locks!'"
Just a quick update...The city council have now erected signs asking people not to attach the lovelocks to the bridge. A whopping 300kg of locks have been removed from the bridge in the last year! irishtimes.com/news/environment/council-sign…
Bit of a poor effort at a sign! Hopefully people will take heed.
"A poor effort is an understatement, it will be floating down the Liffey after the first strong gust of wind. Pathetic effort."
it is clearly identified as a TEMPORARY sign! presumably as they decide what is an appropriate and aesthetically proper sign is decided on. at least they are doing something and we should all be happy with that (except for the local lock sellers!)
"Temporary to the council tends to mean an unending period of time, look at all the temporary pothole repairs they carry out. This problem has existed for many months and it's taken them that long to come up with something a small child could knock up in a few minutes. Think I'll be holding on to my padlock.com shares for a while longer!"
Heading there this week to do mine with my seven dwalf girl friends :). Seven more locks to be taken off!!!!!!!can't wait why not come and stop me??? Hahahahaha get ya locks off honey!!!!
