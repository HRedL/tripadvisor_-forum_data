"Hi! I just read at the Moscowtimes: ""The 14 day self-isolation regime for people returning to Moscow from some of the worst-affected countries was extended. People entering the capital from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, U.K, Norway and the U.S are required to stay inside for two weeks."" So I have to cancel my trip to Russia? Does that mean that if I go to Russia, I will have to stay in my hotel for 14 days?"
So what country are you arriving from? This is a clue...
"We are supposed to go in mid April. We don't have visas yet and Aeroflot has not mentioned anything. I would say, unless otherwise noted at this point you should not go if you are entering from one of those countries. They may change it? If not.....you may get stuck in hotel or who knows where else....especially if your Visa expires while you are there. https://www.interfax.ru/moscow/698107"
USA. April 17th to Moscow
"""Does that mean that if I go to Russia, I will have to stay in my hotel for 14 days?""If you are from one of the listed countries then the statement is pretty self explanatory, it's what Self-Isolation is, and I am guessing the Hotel won't be over the moon having you there either, or maybe even refuse your reservation. So I would take the self-isolation restriction as the less than subtle message ""Don't come""."
"I am also booked a Russia tour for mid-April, leaving from NY and worried about the 14 day quarantine for travelers from the US. Please keep me posted. Any advices would be welcome."
">""The 14 day self-isolation regime for people returning to Moscow from some of the worst-affected countries ----it says ""people returning to Moscow"" : this applies to people living in Moskow, who return home"
"“USA. April 17th to Moscow..The U.S is NOT on the list of worst-affected counties, travelers coming from which must be self isolated. As of March 9, People entering the capital from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain are required to stay inside for two weeks. All previous press report misinterpreted the official statement, as of today the U.S, UK, Norway and Switzerland are not on the list.https://m.interfax.ru/698219Edited: 4:08 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"“USA. April 17th to Moscow..The U.S is NOT on the list of worst-affected counties,I would seriously be reconsidering my travel plans. I myself booked a trip almost a year ago to take my mother to Tokyo in early April, but canceled when case number hit 50 and large gathering were being cancel, the Marathon limited to elite runner only, Japan is now at over 500 cases and schools are closed.In terms of the US, cases were at 209 on the 6th of March, now barely 3 days later the number is approaching 500 at 484, so more than doubling in 3 days, and factor in opinion that the numbers are actually much higher due to the low testing rate in the US.Cases in Switzerland have trebled in the last 3 days from 118 to 337, so expect almost all western Europe countries to be on the list with Germany and France now over 1,000 and Italy overtaking South Korea with cases doubling in 3 days to 7,375. In the last 3 days there have been 11,600 new cases and only 273 were in China.Edited: 4:44 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"To give you an idea of the speed at which the situation in the US is worsening, today in the space of 5 hours the US has passed 500, now sitting at 538 recorded cases with 3 new deaths taking total deaths in the US to 22. That's 54 new recorded cases in just over 5 hours.Now this could include figures from the Grand Princess quarantined in San Francisco as unlike the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess does not have a separate classification, although at last count there were 21 cases on the Grand Princess.All US MSM are reporting US Cases have exceeded 500 with 22 deaths."
"Hi, On the 3rd of april I'm flying Bogota-Barcelona-Moscow (just layover in BCN). Do you think I will be affected by the quarantine guidelines? Where can I get more information? absolutely nothing on Aeroflot."
> Do you think I will be affected by the quarantine guidelines?Maybe yes or maybe not.> Where can I get more information?Right now for April? Nowhere.

"Now the moscowtimes changed its aricle. It says: ""Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced a “high alert regime,” ordering self-isolation for Russians returning from China, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Italy and Spain."" So the restriction seems to be only for russians."
"I am from Greece. From now there is no problem for Greece, but experts say that we will reach the peak of the epidemic in about a month. And I have booked everything to go to Moscow and St Petersburg on the 14th of April (Visas, Air tickets, train tickets). So I am very concerned :( . At least russian embassies should let us revise our visas to a different date with no extra costs. It's so unfair to have to pay again for the visa :("
"panos s....please read the original document instead of spreading false media reports. The March 5 order introducing the high alert regime remains the same...its wording has not changed. The office of the Moscow Mayor clarified the self quarantine requirement covers both Russian citizens and foreign nationals arriving from high risk countries. https:/…12-YM.pdfhttps:/…5e62c2a49a79478054481f50Edited: 3:30 am, March 09, 2020 "
Sorry for spreading false media reports. The original its in russian and i cannot read it. So I have to rely on the english russian newspaper. Thanks for the clarification!
">”the US has passed 500..According to CNN. The CDC has provided a smaller number.Vlad, please read the site carefully, the CDC only update their figures daily, and only on week days, if you checked you would have seen the CDC figures were from last Friday.The figures on all monitoring sites were all over 500, as reported by every US News Agency.Even worse, if you check today, there have been 85 new cases and in the space of 12 hours the US has gone from 534 to passing 600 and now stands as 624.Everyone needs to ignore the idiot in charge of the US who called the virus a hoax and that by April it will have just gone away, and that when the US was 14 cases he was telling the world those numbers would come down to nothing. 624 is not nothing and world stock markets are crashing. Time to wake up and take this seriously as Italy closes in on 10,000 cases."
"According to CDC, the total number of cases in the US is 423 as of March 9, including both, confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. But you are right, they seem to be lagging behind ...https:/…cases-in-us.htmlEdited: 3:55 pm, March 09, 2020 "
