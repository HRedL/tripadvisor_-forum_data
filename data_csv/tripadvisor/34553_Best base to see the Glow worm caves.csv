After having to reschedule our cruise we find there are different ports and no longer are going to Bay of Islands and have only a 6 hour stop in Tauranga. We planned to see the glow worm caves and do the Maori war canoe trip. I see that from Auckland we can do a full day trip (12) hrs to the caves and the Hobbit location. I fear we have no other way to see the caves. It looks like it’s rather far from Auckland! Is there any hope to do these things?
"Check to see if Bush and Beach tours are one of the shore excursions. They run mini-coaches to both locations, and would be worth any extra cost for their tour.Waitomo is a little over 3 hours drive from Auckland. Hobbiton is about 2 hours drive from Waitomo, and it is about 2.40 hours from the movie set back to Auckland. If you accept a tour with an independent operator not affiliated with the cruises, be sure to know that these are driving times only, and dont include the additional times spent at the caves (50 minutes tour) or at Hobbiton (2 hours tour)."
Thank you. We will decide if we want that long a day trip from Auckland. I'm disappointed that the cruise is not staying long enough in Tauranga.
"Hi,Is the cruise still going ahead ?https:/…With the Wuhu flu ramping up many are cancelled or denied shore leave.https:/…https:/….Xl7eoT8zZhEA cruise is the worst way to see NZ as you are discovering. To see and experience a little of what NZ has to offer a self drive road trip is by far the best and most flexible way to go.Cheers,"
