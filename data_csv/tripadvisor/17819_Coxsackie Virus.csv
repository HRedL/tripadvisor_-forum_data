"Hello ,Could someone advise what situation with Coxsackie virus at the moment? In some forums tourists reviews really bad. Loads of people sick. Our trip in Antalya next month, going with young age kids. Any advice?Thanks"
I can see no news about this. Where do you get your info?
From facebook. In Eftalia Ocean hotel and Utopia. I even seen article in foreign media.
"Still can't find any info.What I do know is this: coxsackie is not endemic to Turkey. Much like malaria, it is brought into the country by foreign visitors. In a place like Antalya, with millions of tourists visiting each month, I imagine it is not impossible to encounter - though I still have seen no news.You are, however, lucky. Coxsackie is quite contagious and if it should crop up, we will hear about it well before you are due to arrive."
There was an outbreak at a hotel but it was some time ago.Please post links to the recent information you have found. We can then maybe search locally for more information.
https:/…That’s a foreign media
"There is a virus alert at the link… Anyhow, strangely Coxsackie virus mostly effected Russian tourists last year… Have not heard anything since than…. If there is an epidemic, it should be published in several places… I don’t trust a facebook page and its content…"
"Last information about this virus in Antalya, in turkish, I found from january this year...It can happen in every resort..."
"It can happen anywhere at anytime like in schools, kindergartens etc. Often outbreaks in UK schools. I'm not actually sure what all the panic is about. OK yes it's not pleasant and really something you don't want on holiday but not terrifying either.My personal thoughts are that the last outbreak probably came with the plane and its circulated air."
"Agree completely with vipfamily. It’s a common disease easily spread amongst young children, and not uncommon in schools and nursery’s in the UK. My young niece caught it at her nursery last year. It was not pleasant but no worse than any other childhood illness and she was only poorly for a couple of days.Here’s the link to the NHS advice pagehttps:/…"
"We (4 families with 1 child each, under 2) returned from Side, Sentido Turan Prince Hotel, on Friday, 21th.Three of the kids got sick with hfm on the 3th day of our stay."
Well as the incubation period is 3-5 days this would suggest they were in contact before travelling or on the plane.
