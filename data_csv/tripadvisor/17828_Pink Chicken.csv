"Headed to Paris in August. I just finished reading a chapter of a book on Paris restuarants. One point that jumped off that page was that, according to the book, chicken is typically served only lightly cooked and pink in the center. Is this true? Are French chicken not subject to the salmonella threat that we have in the U.S.?I am really looking forward to eating well in Paris. And I am an adventurous eater. But lightly cooked chicken is just something I can't fathom... what am I missing?"
"Hi, Not fluo pink but certainly still juicy and fleshy. Especially for duck.You need not worry about salmonella in France.If you insist that your poultry is well cooked, specify ""à point"" ( tricky to pronounce,In IPA: /a pwɛ/ )Cheers,S."
"The ɛ vowel is nasalised, it should have a tilde over it, but for some reason it doesn't go through Firefox..."
Pink Chicken?they can keep that! they also eat their duck that way because they say it's red meat.I think i will be a vegetarian for the 4 days i am there if thats the way they prepare their poultry.Crazy French people !
 I eat chicken all of the time in France and have never had it pink or under cooked. My French husband refuses to eat it if it is pink. Now steak is another story.
I've never seen 'pink' chicken In France. If the juices don't run clear than it's not cooked and therefore dangerous.Duck is different and you'll be asked how well you like it cooked.
"""Pink chicken"" is certainly not something acceptable here!! I suggest you change of book then, obviously written by someone who has never been here.A chicken not cooked enough should be sent back immediately to the kitchen."
"You are right, such is the prevalence of the pink chicken epidemic, that there are whole wards reserved to salmonella sufferers in Paris hospitals. They are as large as the ones dedicated to paranoid American tourists. But French doctors are doing a good job in both cases."

These preconceived notions are getting hilarious!! I have eaten chicken at least 15 times while in Paris and have never seen any rare chicken. This forum nearly always comes through with my daily chuckle...
"Wasn't your book about Paris USA ?Because in France, chicken is typically deep cookedThe only pink chicken i ever saw in France (except at my aunt Odile's who is the worst cook in the universe and surroundings) was smoked chicken "
"Believe you me, Norween, in Paris USA (at least the one in Texas), chicken is cooked and cooked and cooked at infinitum. When it's barbecued it is hardly recognizable as chicken anymore. But to echo others, we've eaten lots of chicken in Paris, and have no complaints about the way it has been cooked."
Pink Chicken ? ! Yeurk ! 
"I have had chicken bought at Boston Chicken pink and sometimes blood closer to the bone,i dont't buy it anymore,might as well bake my own if have to finish cooking it at home.Cocque a vin is safe i guess since it's cooked for a long time in the oven."
"Never had pink chicken in Paris, had pink duck though, yummy. "
I bet Paris HIlton would eat pink chicken. It would suit her wardrobe.
"This is right up there with the notion , the other day, that French people have raw bacon for breakfast . "
I can't imagine where the author of this book got their information. I've eaten chicken in Paris on numerous occasions and never was it served undercooked. I would have sent it back if it had.
"Bacon is never raw..it's always smoked,i have eaten bacon that was not cooked or heated up when i was a kid.Prosciotto is raw..it's not even smoked,just all the liquid is out of it.It's our carneverous behavior that has us eating raw meat,maybe we are heading back to the cave man days and don't realise it."
"What book were you reading? Good grief, pink chicken. I've eaten a lot of chicken in France, but never pink.Les"
"BTW, Anne - Is ""yeurk"" French for ""yuck""?"

"The book is acclaimed travel writer Sandra Gustafson's ""Great Eats Paris"". Otherwise, the book seems to be a valuable source of information on Paris restaurants and French dining.... I am not sure where she comes up with this pink chicken comment, but this is a person who has eaten thousands of restaurant meals in Paris. "
"I've eaten a lot of pink things, but never chicken..................As for ""raw "" bacon - love it. No - I mean REALLY love it. Uncooked wild boar bacon. Mrs Wiz despairs of me.And then I start eating her ingredients"
"Shoesy,Actually I mixed french and english.In French, we say ""Beurk"" , and as I am blonde sometimes, I mixed it all and created a new word : Yeurck !"
"Shoesy, ""beurk"" is the French for ""yuck"".And indeed, i have lived 32 years in France without ever seeing pink chicken, i would send it back if i saw any!"
"Jhouston: I've never heard of this person, but I can tell you that she obviously go in very special places if she's used to have pink chicken here ! Maybe it's a cult, ""those who eat everything pink including chicken"" :-)"
This page lists reasons why chicken can be pink yet still fully cooked and safe to eat :…usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/…index.asp
"Anne and Raphy - I've just learned a new French word - ""beurk"". Thanks. I feel so bi-lingual now."
"Chouz: there is also ""pouah"". Marks less an urge to go to ride the giant china bus than ""beurk"", but more the ""put that away from me at once"" side."
"Thank you, Denys. I like that word too. I feel so enlightened, which beats my feeling of total jet-lag any day."
"To call Sandra Gustafson a writer is to be kind, to call her a travel writer is to insult the genre, to call her an acclaimed travel writer is to exaggerate beyond the point even an Irishman would regard as tolerable..."
no - go on - tell us what you really think..........
"I'm actually quite shocked to read that no one on this board has ever been served undercooked chicken in Paris. Just because it's Paris doesn't mean they're immune to an accidental undercooking of a hind quarter. I order poulet frites all the time, and I've had one or two come out on the questionable side. But I've had undercooked chicken here, there and everywhere. Every now and then, people just don't cook it enough. To say it's supposed to be like that is one thing, but to suggest somehow that it never happens in Paris is a bit of a stretch to me. If it comes to the table undercooked, send it back and have them throw it on the fire a while longer. Sandra Gufstafsen eats at cheap restos in Paris. I think the likelyhood of chicken arriving underdone at a place that's charging 12euros for a complete meal is also more likely than some of the restos oft recommended on this board. "
"Excellent point ArrowCapet...only that no one has seen it as a normal thing in Paris, I think, is the point. "
"Cheap places to eat should not mean undercook of bad food,I have had bad food at very expensive restaurants and you better not hurt the chef's feelings and send it back !Once ordered paella for 4(50 minutes wait) at the most expensive Spanish in NYC and was the worst i have ever had,the rice was actually raw and the chef refused to replace it,we paid the bill and walked out."
"I eat at cheap restos. 99% of the time. I have never had pink chicken. There are, however, 2 good reasons for this;If I want antibiotics I go to the Doctor, not a restaurant. Anywhere doing chicken at 12Euro in a menu will be using the cheapest of cheap ingredients. So I dont order chicken.Chicken is boring compared with other fowl, so I dont order chicken. Pineau is good, Oie is good. Capon is good. Chicken is dull.As for ""typically"" what does this mean? is she ordering ""a point"" because she doesnt know what it means? Chicken should be well done. (in fact, burned to a crisp and then microwaved. Then thrown out with the other rubbish.)"
I'm one of the people who said that I've never been served undercooked Chicken in Paris. I was not implying that it's not possible to get undercooked chicken in Paris. The point is that I only visit. There is no comparing being in Paris a week or two and having chicken a couple of times with living there. The odds would certainly go up as with any dish that you will at some point receive a poorly cooked meal. The worse Croque Monsieur I've ever eaten was in Paris.
" Just to clarify - the reference to raw bacon for breakfast came from a person who posted about having it offered by her host family when she was an exchange student in Germany. I thought she was referring to prosciutto also but no, she said it really was raw bacon and part of the German breakfast. So, in Paris, if they offer you bacon at breakfast (I never saw it and assume it would be offered with an American-style breakfast), it's safe to consume! And acccording to the poster's German host family, the bacon they offered also was (...OK, if you say so...) I have also eaten pink smoked things (pink pork chops in a mountain restaurant in Colorado years ago) - they do taste very good."
"This thread was just too funny, all the lighthearted responses to the questions were something to smile about.NO, chicken is always cooked until done, and I might add, the best chicken I have eaten anywhere in the world is in France...we should string up the person who wrote the silly book...who was it anyway?.That is right up there with with raw bacon. But I do love that steak tartare."
Found this photo on the web of roast chicken as served in a bistro there- www.slowtrav.com/photos/showphoto.php…
"All, I don't know what the author of that book was smoking. I had chicken three times in Paris and none of it was pink. In fact, one time it was overcooked and a little dry. So you can all rest a little easier tonight and start making plans to order chicken during your next visit to the French capital."
I am with you most of the roast chicken I had in France was over cooked and dry!Only time I have seen pink chicken is when it has been smoked or whenit has not been fully cooked.
"You can actually get pink chicken by pot roasting it very slowly for a couple of hours. It maintains it colour, but it's certainly cooked. I recently had chicken like this in Amboise."
"Discover, you need to get some recommendations on where to get good chicken!I'm another on the list who's never had undercooked chicken in France -- once again -- that doesn't mean it doesn't ever happen, but it hasn't happened to me.Some of the greatest chicken I've ever had anywhere comes from the open-air markets -- the butchers often have rotisserie trucks that have a rotisserie built into the side of the truck -- they then roast chickens, guinea hens, quail, etc., on the rotisserie, basting them in butter, salt, and pepper. It's about 6-10 Euros for one of these, depending on size and type of bird, and an extra euro or two for the new potatoes that have been roasting at the bottom in all those drippings (yum....) That, some fruit, a bottle of wine, and a loaf of crusty bread to sop all the drippings, makes one of the finest pique-niques you'll ever have.Every one of them has been done perfectly, moist and tender and fully cooked -- and I've been eating them every year for over ten years now (two weeks vacation)."
Semi-raw chicken - pfuiiii - - - Another reason to skip chicken and go for confit de canard. It has been fried first for 2 hours in duck fat and then grilled/fried once again when served. You won't get salmonella infection - but it seriously harms your waistline.....
"Never had under cooked chicken in France either! Only dry and over cooked even from the markets and also from Champion grocery!! ( Just spend 90 days in France! not two weeks!)""G... "" I will only get ""confit"" from now on! It is fantastic! Meelt in my mouth!!!! But I think very fatting ---would not know about how much because I did come home 14 lbs lighter!I did get ""Basque chicken"" twice but the last time ( St. Jean de Luz) I got a neck, a wing and a little piece of some unrecognizable bone! Not good!The best roast chicken I got was again at Le Pre Grill in the 5 th. I do not eat beef so I have chicken alot! Found most to be very dry and over cooked!Bring those recommendations on!!!"
"When our children were very young we served pink chicken all the time. Of course, the rest of us would call it salmon, but for some reason they had a harder time with the idea of eating something with gills than something with wings.BTW I HATE CHICKEN. Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. "
"I love chicken, phread, especially grilled chicken."

"I am afraid I did have undercooked chicken in France at a nice bistrot on Rue des Ecoles. I am glad to see this post, because I was not sure what to think. I had chicken more than once and the other times it was cooked through.However, I want to point out that I was not sure what to think because in general the French undercook many meats in comparison to the cooking scale in the States. For example, if you order your steak medium, you will get rare by American standards. If you want it medium (by US standards) , then best to order ""bien cuit"" which means well done !PS- I even ordered liver once well-done and it was too pink for my taste and I had to send it back to be cooked longer. "
"Phread,How can you hate chicken. Whatever did one of the poor little peckers do to you to deserve such wrath?"
I hate chicken - it's FOWL!
JC - That was a good one.waytogogirl - Hi there! I spoke to my son and he said it's very rainy in your area. Can't you arrange for him to have nicer weather?
"I my gosh shoesy, I thought of you yesterday (and your son) when this weather rolled in ! Tell him to give it a day and surely the sun (amd the heat) will be back, as it does not stay overcast long here !"
"Thank you for your reassuring words, waytogogirl. We only have rain in the winter here, so it's hard to suddenly get used to such wet weather."
