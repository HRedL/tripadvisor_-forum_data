"Good news for all Scots - the First Minister has just announced that from July 10, if you are travelling to Scotland from the 39 'green' countries deemed by the UK Government, you will NOT have to quarantine. This includes Turkey."
"Great news.Many's the heart that would have broke in twa, had ye ne'er have come back again."
"GG Great reply, fingers crossed for end of August.Davie"
"Hi,Where do you find out which countries are in the green category?Thanks"
VIPFamily those links are for England not Scotland.Spain & Serbia are not on Scotlands yet as she rates them to high a risk.Stevie
"Well as the announcement was:“ Good news for all Scots - the First Minister has just announced that from July 10, if you are travelling to Scotland from the 39 'green' countries deemed by the UK Government, you will NOT have to quarantine. This includes Turkey.”So I linked to the U.K. government “green” lists as asked....."
"Yeah, i can't seem to find what countries are in the green and amber categories"
It was said that a full list of countries will be published this week.This is from the Daily Record. A Scottish Newspaper.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/…
"Very strange - I posted this on the Icmeler forum too and it's been closed (presumably because someone complained, although I'm at a loss to understand why?)"
"Good to see things maybe getting back to some kind of normality, just a heads up to anyone flying from Aberdeen with Tui this year, all flights have now been cancelled and departures are being changed to Glasgow, we managed to get ours changed today for 21st September, the Tui woman was saying that there will be no flights from either Aberdeen or Edinburgh to Turkey for the rest of 2020.Ian"
@Julie W you can get the information on the Scottish Government web site . www.gov.scotRena
First minister reminds me of see Jimmy Krankie lol
"Yes thank you, does anyone know if you get tested on arrival at Dalaman airport? And also do you have to wear face masks when you are out and about?Due to come at the end of September and trying to weigh up if to still come, balance due in a couple of weeksThanks"
"""does anyone know if you get tested on arrival at Dalaman airport?"" Not as a matter of course. You'll have to fill in forms on the flight, you'll certainly be overtly or covertly scanned at the airport; there's a lower possibility you may be asked a few questions, and an even lower one that you may get tested.""And also do you have to wear face masks when you are out and about?"" Yes but compliance seems to vary from place to place, and even there, hour by hour."
"Thanks for the information , I’ve 2 weeks to decide what to do"
