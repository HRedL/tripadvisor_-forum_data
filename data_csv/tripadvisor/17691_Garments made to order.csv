"Thinking of having some garments made up when we go in April, where do you think is the best place to have a garment made in the Gambia? Do you have a favourite tailor who has a variety of fabrics to choose from.l have seen some of the roughly sewn items that are made and the seams are coming away. l had a bag made up and had to take it back twice for repair, the maker was lovely though and we hugged each time we met hahaa"
"There's a tailor at Luigis, personally I have never had anything made by him but he was making garments for guests last year when we were there, so I would imagine he would be good, as many are repeat guests.I do know the guests went to the market to buy material for him to make up so not sure if he has plenty of stock on site."
"Hi AngelaThere are Tailors in the indoor market in Serrekunda on the second floor, the market looks a seedy place but they look professional with pattern books etc!! I didn't see any material so I think that they just offered a clothes making service!! I think things fall apart because the don't use the right thread, there are differing threads for different clothes, they don't allow enough seam, and they don't check the tension on their machine, so the sewing is looped, which means it is weak, so ""yes"" then it falls apart!Happy tailor hunting!!Breeze"
"Apologies for hijacking the post Angela but Hassan the tailor at Luigis is the president of The Gambia Southampton Supporters Association and as you can imagine he is fighting a bit of a losing battle as most Gambians seem to support Man Utd so I will have to take some shirts out next month to try to up our profile in the future.I have had some good reports about his work and may have some ""beach"" shirts made.Paul"
"Perhaps he can run me up a couple of Man Utd shirts for me and her indoors as payeing £140 is a joke and a rip off ,How much are S/Hampton shirts,"
Hello JeffMy home and away ones cost me £42 each this year and thats for the short sleeved ones.Will bring a couple of child's Gambia shirts back this time for my grandsons.Paul
"pdjik i bought a couple of gambia footi shirts on the market ,well i paid for them my gambian friend got them for a lot lot less than what he offered them yo me for and id got him down to a third off ,and the walking away bitt didnt work either ,i kept waiting for him to yell OK haha but he never ,finished up getting them for D150 because she got me two ,"
"The amount of people asking for me to bring them united shirts has hit epidemic status so im now supporting Bristol rovers bottom of div 2,so dont think id get many requests for their shirts ,but knowing my luck !!!!!!!!"
"Angela,Whilst staying in and around the Wullingkamma area last March and April, I walked the 'back road' God know's where, but ended up in Brufut Village. I was amazed at the number of tailors along the main road that the buses pick up from (before getting to the main beach side road). There were loads of them although they didnt seem to have much material in stock! Perhaps a visit to Serrakunda Market or into Banjul where you'll be spoilt for choice?Let us know how you get on."
"Ange, granny had a lovely dress made a little while ago. Think it was local to where she is staying.Edited: 7 years ago "
"Oh of course Stardust l know where you mean. Thanks Lynn l'll try Brufut too and will let you know how l get on. Thanks again to everyone, if anyone has any recommendations from experience that would be useful too"
"I don't know any tailors who keep fabrics or even thread in sock. You would be amazed at the number of shops selling cottons, trimmings etc by tailors shops! You have to go and buy your own fabric and take it to them, then either explain what you want or choose from the books they have. They will then give you a price, haggle of course, and he will sew it for you. He gets the thread, trimmings etc himself for you. Its been a bit hit and miss for me finding a good tailor but I have an excellent one in Tanji now, his finishing is brilliant, There was also a good one in London Corner but you would have to go with a local as he spoke no English!If you want help to find the tailor in Tanji let me know, he really is very good!"
