"Nice to have only 1 active case in S. Miguel, but regarding the entry rules already posted on other posts (after the end of the mandatory quarantine), nothing has changed... still the 4 not so tourist friendly options. Now available in english https:/…AAs_20200528.pdfAnd now also the declaration that needs to be fill up at arrival https:/…AAs_20200528.pdf"
"Well, my post was more about the update on flights availability, not on the COVID procedures"
"I was planning to visit the Azores in late September after first spending a week in continental Portugal. Certainly, the entrance requirements may change by then, but I am curious whether I, as a non-EU citizen could have an elective covid test done in Portugal during the 72 hrs leading up to the Azores part of the trip. Any thoughts?"
I dont see why not you dont need a doctor prescription just a certified lab and pay for the test.
"So, if I choose Option 1 - to get a COVID test within 72 hours of when I depart from home - and the test is negative, and I bring appropriate proof...on a two week visit, I will still need to be re-tested on day 5 and day 13. Of course, I have to pay for the test I take before leaving home. But what about the follow-up tests on Day 5 and Day 13? Who pays for those (and if that's me, how much are they)? While waiting for the Day 5 and Day 13 test results (up to 24 hours), am I quarantined or self-isolated? Thanks."
"as a non-EU citizen could have an elective covid test done in Portugal during the 72 hrs leading up to the Azores part of the trip - Yes, just go to a private lab and ask how to do it, a COVID-19 serology test is possible without prescription."
"Who pays? I would say the azores government based on this ""on the 5th and 13th days, from the date of the SARS CoV 2 screening test, in case it is extended to this or for more days, contact the Health Authority of the municipality where I reside or am staying, with a view to conducting a new SARS CoV 2 screening test, to be promoted by the local Health Authority, the result of which will be communicated to me within 24 hours."" and because they pay for those arriving without the test...While waiting for the Day 5 and Day 13 test results (up to 24 hours), am I quarantined or self-isolated? I would say self-isolate, because mandatory quarantine is no longer legal."
"Good answers, ptnov64. Thank you."
Until what date will these measures be implemented?We flew into Lisbon from Amsterdam with no test or quarantine needed - would love to visit Azores in a week or 2 but won't if we have to spend our time there getting tested or isolating.
Until what date will these measures be implemented - How knows?? We'll probably have to wait till the end of June to see if it's going to change in July...
"Since June 15th the entry rules have suffered a slight change:Option 1 - to get a COVID test within 72 hours of when I depart from home - and the test is negative, and bring appropriate proof.Option 2 - to get a COVID test at arrival and remain in prophylactic isolation at your home or place where you are staying until you are informed of the outcome of the same.Option 3 - which is to return to the place of origin of your flightIf on 7 days or plus visit, will still need to be re-tested on day 6 from the date of the SARS-CoV-2 screening test.Official info available only in portuguese https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl…"
I understand the new restrictions about entering with a Covid test but it seems that Portugal is now limiting entry and currently North Americans are not welcome in Portugal for nonessential travel. My question is- is this also true for the Azores or are they welcoming nonessential American tourists as long as they have the negative covid test. I’m reading conflicting things on the Azores site v embassy.
"DeletedEdited: 9:42 am, June 21, 2020 "
"@freelanceWith everything I read in the past week, they all indicated that immigration policy is same in all of Portugal. Azores just implement additional health screening policy on top of the immigration policy. I know what you are hoping for, but I’m afraid that’s just wishful thinking...If you look at the travel restrictions on IATA, the four bullets are1. Immigration entry policy2. Flight restriction policy3. Madeira health screening policy4. Azores health screening policyEdited: 9:53 am, June 21, 2020 "
"I think any American who's expecting to hop a plane to the Azores soon is engaged in wishful thinking.Given the high virus spread currently occurring in many parts of the USA (and the shocking lack of measures to control it) I'm afraid that it's perfectly understandable why EU countries including Portugal would say ""no, thanks"" to tourists from the USA who want to visit. I'll be surprised if the Azores opened their doors to Americans any earlier than the rest of Portugal or the EU as a whole.I live in the USA and am hoping to visit the Azores in 2021 if that's possible (I'm hoping for fall 2021 but that still seems somewhat optimistic to me). Alas, I have to admit that if I were an EU resident (or leader of an EU country) I wouldn't want to allow Americans in either, until America gets the virus under control. It's depressing (as an American) but perfectly understandable why other countries that have taken the painful steps necessary to gain control of the pandemic would be reluctant to risk another outbreak by letting in tourists from countries that never did.For me, 2021 (or maybe 2022) can't come soon enough."
"I totally agree but as it stands my July 6 flight has not been canceled, my inter island flights have not been canceled (Which means I cant get a refund “yet”), my cars are paid for, and my AirBnb Is non refundable. At this point I have nothing to lose by trying. Everything is paid for. I’ll get the Covid test on the 4th and call on the 6th to see if I’m allowed in. Just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat."
"I feel for you. My trip is planned for late Aug - early September. I have a lot of eyes and ears on the ground so if there are any developments I will post it here. As of now air tickets are being sold for your departure date by both TAP and Azores Airlines and I know that the flights between islands are going. Before even boat trips were prohibited.Edited: 10:13 am, June 22, 2020 "
"A really basic truth that everyone should understand:Just because an airline is selling tickets, that does not mean that YOU (or any random person) can enter a country (or, if they manage to enter, will not be held by authorities and put on the first flight out). This is really basic, yet so many people seem to think it gives them a magic power to skip the rules."
As of now these are the regulations:https://www.azoresairlines.pt/en/mandatory-p…There is nothing newer.
New info. Not sure how it reflects on Azores.https://www.axios.com/eu-american-travelers-…
"I just thought I'd post my question here instead of opening yet another topic. I am from The Netherlands and since Portugal is open for us to travel to I was considering the Azores. I read that you have to take a test as soon as you land, but nowhere does it say how long you have to wait for the results.Does anyone know? I know in Greece you get it within 24 hours after arrival. After that no need to do a new test on every new island you visit right?And are hotels and smaller B&B's open? I know no one will know exactly but hope to find some people here who live there/ been there recently/ have ears and eyes on the ground :)Edited: 9:58 am, June 25, 2020 "

"@americagirl22Not official site, but..https:/…covid-19-updateEdited: 10:20 am, June 25, 2020 "
@americagirl22Sorry for multiple posts... here's the official link. I noticed they changed it in the past few days. No mention of how long the test takes..https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?page_id=5532
"The news (broadcast on TV) in the mainland (portuguese going from Lisbon or Porto also have to have a valid negative test or will be tested like any other tourist) is that it's taking more than 48h. The info from the local government was that it would take less the 24h, but that's not the reality."
Hmmmm ... thanks! That doesn’t make it any easier. I can deal with 24 hours in a hotel room but if it can be 3 days or is uncertain than I am not sure I want to take that risk
"Omg, i read it would be within 12 hours on terceira and sao miguel. These are the only islands with test labs."
"And in Holland you can only get a test with certificate from commercial labs, 135-175 pp"
"The regional government announced today that ""it will extend the network of COVID-19 screening analysis laboratories to the mainland, as of July 1, through conventions with private laboratories, thus streamlining procedures for those wishing to travel to the Region."" So maybe this way there will be less people doing it at arrival. I think that it's only in portuguese for now https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/…"
"Thank you for sharing this. I’m confused though since the US really only has private labs to carry out tests and I assume they will not be on this list. I had assumed any private PCR test from a reputable US lab would suffice. Of course this all might be moot if US visitors are not allowed into the Azores. Follow up question... If Portugal goes along with the EU and bans US travelers, as an autonomous region is there any chance the Azores will allow it- especially with these Covid testing requirements?"
"I don’t know if anyone knows until it’s announced. But from what I’ve read, Azores and mainland Portugal appear to have the same immigration policy today"
Thank you. I hope they decide sooner rather than later.
"I had assumed any private PCR test from a reputable US lab would suffice - you are correct. But remember that Portugal is a country with a public national health system (social security, not insurances, is the backbone) which is the main provider of health care, not privates. Tests done on the public system (or at private labs with a contract with the state) are either free or you pay just a few euros to do it, you just need a prescription. So for portuguese it's important to have this info, if you have to go to the SNS (which is equivalent to the british NHS) labs or not. And portuguese from the mainland also have to do the test to ""enter"" Azores.Edited: 2:41 am, June 27, 2020 "
"Test results taking longer than 48 hours, does that refer to the first test that has to be conducted in combination with isolation when you don't already have a negative test result from a test taken in your home country 72 hours before flight takeoff?I'm looking into testing at home, so that would leave the extra tests on the Azores on day 5 and 13. Does anybody know if you can conduct this test and, while already presented a negative test result on arrival, await the test result (by e-mail?) while continuing to travel? In other words, is isolation also required with the day 5 and 13 tests?Also, the moment of when my '72 hours before takeoff' in my home country will be conducted will determine on which island I will be on day 5 and 13. It's possible it will be on other islands than Terceira and São Miguel. I'm confused how the testing works on the other islands. Any information about that would be appreciated.Any recent experiences at all with testing on the Azores would be very useful.""If your stay in the Azores lasts for seven or more days, you must, on the 5th and 13th days, from the date of the SARS CoV 2 screening test, in case it is extended to this or for more days, contact the Health Authority of the municipality where I reside or am staying, with a view to conducting a new SARS CoV 2 screening test, to be promoted by the local Health Authority, the result of which will be communicated to me within 24 hours."""
"Test results taking longer than 48 hours - tests done at arrival, for those that arrive without a negative test.It's possible it will be on other islands than Terceira and São Miguel. I'm confused how the testing works on the other islands- the other islands don't have lab facilities for this kind of test. So if you have to do a test there, the sample has to be sent to Terceira or S. Miguel, that alone will take more than 24h to reach the lab... extra tests on the Azores on day 5 and 13 - since June 15th, it's only at day 6, ""Extending the stay for seven or more days, the passenger must, on the 6th day, counting from the date of the SARS-CoV-2 screening test, contact the health authority of the municipality where he resides or is housed, with a view to conducting a new SARS-CoV-2 screening test, to be promoted by the local health authority, the result of which will be communicated to you."" Take all that in consideration if you really don't want to stay stranded in some remote island due to this..."
How much would it cost me to get a test done in Lisbon?I have been here the past few weeks and would like to visit Azores.
"ptnov64, thank you for your quick response. I didn't know it was limited to 'just' a Day 6 test now. Where can I find the most recent policy in English?""Take all that in consideration if you really don't want to stay stranded in some remote island due to this..."" Does this mean you also have to stay in isolation while waiting for the test results of the Day 6 test? Or do you mean that in case the test is positive, you must go in isolation at the island you are staying at that time, and you wouldn't want that to be a remote small island? Because it's still not clear to me if isolation is required for the Day 6 test or if you can just wait for the results while continuing your trip. In the latter case, it wouldn't matter that the sample has to be brought to another island."
"Where can I find the most recent policy in English? Not available at the official website... here's in portuguese https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl…Because it's still not clear to me if isolation is required for the Day 6 test - after any test it's supposed to do self-isolation at your place of accommodation until the result comes. if you are for instance at Flores, the sample for test will take at least 24h to reach Terceira/S. Miguel and then at least 24/48h to be processed, meaning that for at least 4 days (maybe longer) you are supposed to be on self-isolation... if there's any delay on flights out of that island then it will be longer.in case the test is positive, you must go in isolation at the island - that also! the local health authorities will immediately be notified and they will have to secure that you are isolated (after a positive test it will become a crime not be isolated) and all that were in contact with you will be tested..."
How much would it cost me to get a test done in Lisbon? around the 120€. But it has to be a PCR test and I have no idea if you can do one without a prescription. Till now i haven't seen the list of the labs with whom the Azores government is going to have contract to do these tests in the mainland. Once that list exists/is public you just have to go there with your plane ticket and do it.
"""after any test it's supposed to do self-isolation at your place of accommodation until the result comes."" Thanks again for your reply. I can't seem to find this in the policy. Not in the English (old) version, nor in the most recent Portuguese version (thank you for the link!). Only for the test you have to take on arrival when you don't already carry a non-covid declaration (max 72 hours before flight), it is stated explicitly that you have to wait for the results while in isolation. That makes sense - it's uncertain whether you're infected or not.However, from the time between either flight arrival (with non-covid declaration from back home) or first test result (negative - carried out by Azores Health Authority) and day 6, you are allowed to travel the islands without being in isolation. On day 6, you would have to return in isolation until the results of you day 6 tests are provided? That doesn't make sense to me.""in case the test is positive, you must go in isolation at the island - that also!"" Of course the situation changes entirely when testing positive. I am aware of that."
"On day 6, you would have to return in isolation until the results of you day 6 tests are provided? That doesn't make sense to me - you are doing a test on day 6, because it's not impossible that a contamination will occur once in the island or that at the time of the 1st negative test you had been very recently contaminated and the virus was not yet detectable... so, in fact not that different from the conditions for the ""original"" test. Only for the test you have to take on arrival... it is stated explicitly that you have to wait for the results while in isolation - yes, but knowing how the health authorities have been acting in azores I very much doubt that they will not tell you that you have to wait in isolation... it's also true that if you are infected you have been spreading the virus for at least 3/4 days... so it's one of those things that makes living with the virus a pain, Because the only effective solution is to stay closed indoors which is not a ""real"" option. Life has move forward, taking as much caution as possible."
"If I'm not mistaken, the current policy was valid until last midnight. The website https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/ still links to the June 15 policy. Any news on changes in policy?""14 - A presente resolução produz efeitos a partir das 00:00 horas do dia 15 de junho até às 00:00 horas de dia 1 de julho."""
"This is the general for the Portuguese territory ""After the EU recommendations this is a summary of what's going to be the rules in Portugal from ""00 hours on 1 July 2020 and until 11:59 pm on 15 July 2020 - Authorizes flights originating in countries with a positive epidemiological assessment, observing the recommendation of the EU Council regarding direct air connections with Portugal, and subject to confirmation of reciprocity: Algeria; Canada; South Korea; Morocco; Tunisia; China.It prohibits air traffic to and from Portugal on all flights to and from countries that are not part of the European Union or that are not countries associated with the Schengen Area. Except, exclusively for essential trips. Flights originating in the United States of America, given the presence of important Portuguese communities. ""Passengers on flights from Portuguese-speaking countries and the USA must present, at the time of departure, proof of test to COVID-19, with a negative result, carried out in the last 72 hours before departure, under penalty of being refused entry into national territory""BUT both Azores and Madeira can add/adapt to their reality - so let's see if they will issue something different from what was decided on June 15 today or the next days."
"Hmmm. The infamous “reciprocity” condition. I wonder if that only applies to China, as it’s worded in the EU recommendation. This is so much uncertainty. How am I suppose to plan for travel?"
@ptnovDo you have link to that article/summary?
Never mind. Found it. https:/…

"Hey all,I'm planing to go diving in the Azores (Santa Maria) from July 14 to July 26. The dives shops there keep telling me that the pre-testing/testing requirements would be lifted on July 1st but so far, no announcements yet on the official page https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/ All the info is in English by the way, just select the correct language here https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?page_id=5509My understanding from reading it is also that for the re-rest on Day 6, there is no isolation required... I want to get tested at home here in Switzerland but not sure it will be accepted. The published list of labs is only for the Portuguese mainland labs https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl… Pre-testing at home would save me the isolation period on Santa Maria... Testing on arrival is not a preferred option as you guys stated here that it could take more than 48H to get the results.And the Day 6 re-testing is a bit blurry as well for people who are on Santa Maria. It's tiny, no labs. If I have to pay a plane or ferry ticket to get back to Sao Miguel and back, I'd rather just give up.... Was so looking forward to this dive trip."
"According to this document:https:/…AAs_20200615_VF.pdfThere is a County Health Authority on Santa Maria: Vila do Porto:Dr. Carlos Pinto -sres-dsvp@azores.gov.pt - 296 820 100Working days from 09h to12h and from 14h to16hSo you can get tested on Santa Maria on the 6th day. Corvo, Flores, Sao Jorge and Graciosa apparently do not have testing facilities. All other islands doEdited: 10:37 am, July 02, 2020 "
"The dives shops there keep telling me that the pre-testing/testing requirements would be lifted on July 1st - there was never such an indication... on the contrary the pressure is to extend that practice to the airports at the mainland. I want to get tested at home here in Switzerland but not sure it will be accepted - yes, as long as it is a PCR test not a serology test. The published list of labs is only for the Portuguese mainland labs - that's because the local government wants all the portuguese from the mainland that will go to azores (on vacations or visiting family) to do the test at the mainland, not at the arrival. So that the pressure on the local labs will be lower.And the Day 6 re-testing is a bit blurry as well for people who are on Santa Maria. It's tiny, no labs - true, no lab, but the collection of the sample can be done at the facility mentioned above. Then it will be sent to Ponta Delgada to be processed, the cost of this test is paid by the local government.My understanding from reading it is also that for the re-rest on Day 6, there is no isolation required...time (next weeks) will tell which is the procedure that the authorities are in reality recommending."
Thanks for the input. Yeah I'll just wait until the very last minute to book anything. Safer. :)
"""The dives shops there keep telling me that the pre-testing/testing requirements would be lifted on July 1st"" That would be ideal!Has anyone on the ground heard this also?"
Absolutely not! As of now you must be tested prior and retest on Azores after 6 days. there are plenty of links to the relevant documents in this thread.
"Forget any chance of ""pre-testing/testing requirements would be lifted on July 1st"" or all along the summer! The Azores government has even made agreements with labs in the mainland so that portuguese from the mainland would do the tests before flying to the islands. The end of that is simply not going to happen. In June due to this system they've found at least 4 people positive at arrival and that shows the risk of new spreading to the community in the islands."
"Hi all,Is there any information known yet about island hopping and the covid test that needs to be done on the 6th day? My girlfriend and me are (normally) arriving in Sao Miguel 21/07, and 25/07 we're flying from Sao Miguel to Faial and on 27/07 to Pico, 30/07 back to Sao Miguel.

That's the local contact (a local GP at the local health center for sure)which will direct you to the lab for the day6 test. But probably at arrival either you'll receive an info and contact equal to this one or already a direction on where to go.
"I've just received the following confirmation from the general e-mail account EsclarecimentoCovid19@azores.gov.pt:""You don´t have to stay in isolation until you get de result of the second test."""
Great!! Good news.
Does anyone have any information on what the average waiting time is to get results back from testing undertaken on arrival? We are travelling from the UK so there are limited facilities whereby a paper test result can be provided (health service test results are received back via text message only). Can anyone advise on their experience?
"the average waiting time is to get results back from testing undertaken on arrival? Minimum 48h, but 3 days is not uncommon. Here you can find info about people that are or were there https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18912…"
Do the results have to be on paper (rather than a text or email)? Also I read on another thread that the NHS test doesn;t specify it's the PCR test.
