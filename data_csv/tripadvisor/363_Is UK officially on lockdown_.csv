"Have flight+hotel booked for April but it is not safe to travel anymore, there is no ban for US nationals to travel into UK but if UK is now officially on lockdown, will flight & hotel cancel easier on no refund reservations? Thanks."
"Officially we are not in lockdown, the Government is “advising” people not to travel or go out to Pubs/Restaurants."

"OP,Where are you planning on traveling from.The “World” is a pretty broad location, and there might be travel restrictions to/from the UK.What Passport do you hold?Such answers might be able to help others direct you better.Good luck,Hunt"
"Still not on lockdown. Keep checking official, ie, government, sources for information."
No. But the situation is changing quickly as H15-steria is taking effect. I guess more people will die from it than Covid-19.
"""I guess more people will die from it than Covid-19.""The previous advice that the Government were giving was predicted to result in 260000 deaths.It is re-assuring that Boris is so on the ball."
"The UK is not officially on lockdown, but the advice is to pretend it is and act accordingly. Enforcement will be through social shaming."
Tate is due to close for a month. I was looking forward to seeing Warhol and Kusama this year. H15-steria strikes again.
Looks as though the King Tut exhibition is still going.
"Although we are not officially on lockdown at the moment it's highly possible we will be in the next few weeks or even days, many places are closing now as a precaution anywayI would advise contacting flight and hotel companies direct to cancel your visitEdited: 7:31 am, March 17, 2020 "
"From the US, with US passport."
"I am but until UK goes officially on lockdown or US bans travel from the US, they are considering any cancellations voluntary. It would make it easier on travellers if UK officially had a lockdown. First and foremost to protect UK citizens. I plan to visit it as soon as this madness has passed."
"Officially lockdowned London ...Please explain that ...Little is open and operating anywhere near normally, eg - hour long queues to get into a local supermarket, many empty shelves and I hour + waiting to pay.Closures of all, that I know, includes Theatres, Museums, Cinemas, some Pubs and Restaurants and London is Ghost-like...CheersAnthony"
"Yes but until government makes it official, the airlines and hotels only go by that. They keep saying it is voluntary."
"""They keep saying it is voluntary.""Currently it is. Although many places are closed or closing the UK is not on lockdown."
UK government today advised against all but essential international travel for Brits. Has the US not done the same? I'd be surprised if your flight isn't cancelled. In the UK many events are cancelled and venues closing as we have all been advised to cut back on social contact. There may be little to do if you get here.https:/…domestic
"Depends on the airline and hotel. I cancelled a trip to London for this weekend. Hotel was non refundable but I’m getting a full refund (IHG property). Flight was no. RefundBle but BA is allowing me to apply for a voucher to be used for future travelHotel in Jersey won’t allow me a refund of a non refundable booking but will allow me a credit against a future booking, so that seems very fair to me."
British Library is closed from tonight.
"Dottie - Regarding Delta. ""Flights from Atlanta (ATL) and New York (JFK) to London will remain on the schedule operating once per day."" Which Delta has already one, as there are usually 3 flights a day from ATL-LHR. Fortunately, I'm on one of the flights they eliminated. Unfortunately, Delta hasn't told me, and they won't talk to me either since my flight is still 10 days away. I believe they are trying to get customers to cancel, so they can give credit towards a new flight instead of telling the customer flights are cancelled so they avoid giving full refunds.Edited: 5:29 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Royal Academy of Arts, National Portrait Gallery, National Gallery, Hayward Gallery ... sadly (but probably wisely) all closing with immediate effect."
"Per the OP, ""stay In place"" with travel restrictions will occur, hopefully soon, given current COVID-19 transmissions in the U.K. and around the globe."

Who cares when something closed. The information is that it is not open.Art Galleries were specifically being mentioned.Anthony K
No harm in explaining why things are closed. Not everything is shut because of COVID-19

"No, the US is still allowing US citizens to travel anywhere they want. The ban is only FROM EU and UK. So, unless UK issues an official lockdown or US bans all travel from the US, they won't cancel flights. My flight is still scheduled. And hotel hasn't issued any flexibility not even in light of what is happening on a world scale."
OK daft question if they are banning all flights FROM the UK how do you plan to get back to the USA?
"Grounding all planes, Worldwide, has not happened. Could you ground them all, at their hubs, if flights stop.

"I think an official lockdown can't be far off. I know of at least 2 Hotels in NW London have been cleared to act as quarantine ""hospitals""."
They haven't banned all flights from the UK. UK citizens cannot fly but US citizens can. There are still lots of ghost flights in the air even if the tickets for those flights have been cancelled.
We are probably fast approaching it middle of next week would be my guess
"Suggest a lot of these posts are missing the point;Is UK in lock down mode? No, at least not yet. Isn't the bigger question whether right now we should be travelling for pleasure at all? The fact is that we are at the front end of a pandemic. A few posters can deny this if they choose but it is a fact..check John Hopkins University website if you want the global data and how it is ramping up day by day). It will get worse - not my opinion, US Fed govt is saying that, CDC is saying that -- choose your own (reliable) national website to validate if you want. The only way to turn around the rate of increase in transmission is for people to minimize social contact - again not my opinion, check relevant websites in US, UK or wherever.Most TA forums fully recognize this and are actively encouraging participants not to travel there right now (eg Hawaii sites, Washington State site). Seems to me we have a civic duty to do support this effort and that surely means not travelling for pleasure right now because that is what we are being asked to do and the request - in fact in many jurisdictions the demand - makes sense.That all said everyone has the right to disagree and if so, I would suggest to OP - even though UK is not ""locked down"" that he/she checks with his/her travel insurance (interruption, cancellation and medical) provider that the insurance covers Covid-19 related issues now that it is a known risk. Many companies have now explicitly excluded it."
"Davidf I do not want to travel at all as we are on lockdown here in US with all schools off and restaurants closed. I just would like a refund on my trip which the airline and hotel are not automatically issuing in light of a world pandemic.But so far because UK has not followed suit, allows these businesses to consider any type of cancellation as voluntary and therefore one loses all money."
"Schools in the UK are now closed, except for a few exceptions in some areas. Could last until September. Exams postponed but may go ahead at some time during the summer. The situation may change as things deteriorate or get better ... SK19I hope you resolve things quickly and to your satisfaction; refunds or useful vouchers. Please keep us informed, when you have exhausted all avenues.Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 10:32 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Re post 36 ""In West London, my home area, for the foreseeable future""The same is true of East London -yesterday. But at the moment ""the foreseeable future"" is no more than until the next government press conference at 5pm each day. Moreover, being able to maintain the semblance of basic necessities of daily life is not what people travel thousands of miles and pay oodles of money for."
I understand ... but nothing in the TA rules says that Londoners cannot talk to Londoners...Keep wellAnthony K
"The only way to turn around the rate of increase in transmission is for people to minimize social contact - again not my opinion, check relevant websites in US, UK or wherever.'That isn't strictly true which adds to confusion,in an article I read on Tuesday an 'expert' said that closing bars for 12 weeks would likely result in an explosion(the very word used) of cases when they reopen in July,the claim was that by leaving them open people will build up a natural immunity to the virus.The whole thing is a leap of faith IMO,nobody really knows,it seems very much like fingers crossed!"
40 non-interchange Underground stations will close as from tomorrow ...Transport Commissioner Mike Brown said: 'The advice from Government is clear – people should now only be making journeys that are absolutely essential. We and our staff are doing everything we can to ensure that people who need to make essential journeys can continue to do so.'Anthony K
"OP:Hang in there if you can. We were slated to fly out Mar 25 and return on April 5 from Philadelphia. Just yesterday, British Airways finally cancelled the return leg of the flight, allowing us to cancel and get our money back.We called last night and are getting a full refund on flight, taxes, money we spent to upgrade seats and even the cost of selecting our seats (since we are only bronze level we had to pay to do so.) Plus, we are getting back the Avios points we used to pay for some of it as well. Now, the refund hasn't come through yet (they asked for 24 hours), so I'm still a bit twitchy, but this will be a major portion of what we paid for our trip. If you have the nerves to hold out up until the day you fly, you might be able to get a refund instead of a voucher. Good luck!!"
"apologies for my misunderstanding. Several have posted that airlines are being cooperative..I cancelled trip to Seattle about 3 weeks ago due to emerging issue and experienced same thing both with airline (Delta code-share with Westjet) and the hotel in Seattle even though we had paid to get a discount so hotel was well within its ""rights"" to keep the money - and this was well before states of emergency, border closings and so forth.So think your chances are good of getting the money. Good luck."
">>Now, the refund hasn't come through yet (they asked for 24 hours), so I'm still a bit twitchy, but this will be a major portion of what we paid for our trip. <<Unless the airline collapses, you'll get your money back. But be prepared to wait up to three months as some airlines are seriously struggling with credit and cash flow issues at the moment."
"3 months? Are you kidding? With all the resources they have? They are multibillion dollar companies, they should issue refunds electronically immediately to travellers.Edited: 8:43 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"SK19... I'm sorry to sound blunt, but what is your priority? Not transmitting a potentially fatal disease to UK residents?Not transmitting a potentially fatal disease on your return to the USA?Going to the pub? Claiming off your travel insurance?We are not in lockdown here, but that could change tomorrow.Currently the US gov't says you can leave the USA, but will have limited airports to return to & may be subject to some form of health screening on return to the USA.Currently the UK govt is permitting US citizens/resident to enter the UK. That may well change as the UK braces itself to an upward demand on our national health system.Currently trans Atlantic airlines are still flying over the pond. Again, this may change if the airlines decide to cancel flights due to low demand or the risk to the health & safety of their staff. As for refunds for flights, hotels, car hire etc....if your own govt issues a travel ban/ advisory, you may be able to claim a refund from your airline or travel insurance company.If the UK gov't mandates a travel ban , you may be able to register a claim with your travel insurance company or get a credit/refund from your airline for your fares.I appreciate you are hugely disappointed at not being able to visit the UK, but fingers crossed, you'll be able to travel here in the winter or even next year.BTW... although we are not currently in full lock down mode, many people, companies & cultural sites here have been deeply affected by tragic events in Italy, & have opted to close or self isolate."
"We had a package deal due to depart for Malta on Sunday (March 22nd),on the day the flights were cancelled refund was mentioned,that word seems to have gone from their communications just leaving future booking,watch this space!"
So you reckon that Travel Companies will issue “vouchers” or IOU’s for re-scheduling at a later date?
I think the travel companies are hoping customers will cancel then they can get away with issuing vouchersIf they cancel they will have to give refunds
"Example ...British Airways ...Will only liaise with you if you are due to travel within the next 72 hours ... you can use the cancellation, online, form, but it may take a week for them to answer and maybe act on your cancellation and, on the form, it does not mention re-bookings, vouchers or refunds.They are offering vouchers,if you want them, for some cancellations, dependent on the reason for the cancellation, and it depends on whether you or they are the ones that have cancelled the flights.Refunds have been offered and accepted where BA has made the cancellation.How quickly you get a refund, into your Bank, is unknown.Anthony K"
"Mcpinder... If you read my posts, I don't want to travel because there is a pandemic. Just want tourism businesses to acknowledge the sameand canel and issue a refund. I don't want a voucher. I want a refund. I checked the fb page for my airline and everybody wants the refund but they are ignoring all customers, there is only 1-2 planes in the air but they keep listing a large number of flights on schedule to retain money."
"""there is only 1-2 planes in the air but they keep listing a large number of flights ""At 12-45pm there was 9706 planes in the air."
Ian S is a plane spotter.
"Ok so we have now received an email detailing the refund amount,no mention of how long so watch this space!"
"Yikes, I almost booked my flight with British Airways, I went with United. They have been allowing rescheduling and cancellation for weeks all the way through April. People are going to remember this."
"Ian. i meant for the airline I booked with, which is Virgin Atlantic"
Do you think the lock in is due a come back?
"Now watch the Drinks aisle at your nearest Supermarket empty!I started tonight just as the shutdown was announced and most of the Pubs In Glasgow City Centre and the “Finnieston Strip” are Closed!End times indeed when a Glasgow Boozer is shut!If the Virus doesn’t get me I reckon I’ll have Liver failure by the end of this, this really is enough to drive you to drink!Edited: 4:05 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Hi, Just wondering whether Hotels are technically included in the announcement made this evening by the Government? They didn't in particular mention Hotels?Thanks"
"Hotel's and their immediate future ...Some are housing guests quarantined from family homes and others from their home countries. Also, most are not taking new guests or non-residents into their restaurants and cafes, if open.Finally, some, when emptied or empty, will be grabbed, at the taxpayers expense, to be used by the NHS.C'est la vieAnthony K"
"Anthony,It's already happened - I know of two hotels in NW London that have been prepared for use as quarantine centres."
The Heathrow Ariel hotel was taken over weeks ago.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/1…
"I believe there is a lot of spare space, currently, in Buckingham Palace ... whilst the freebie-scroungers are at their country cottage in Windsor...Anthony K"
So that's why the Ariel Hotel was had hoardings around it last Saturday when I walk past it. https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/6419169
"Jet2 are certainly making hard work of our refund,the first payment was the last amount paid for the seat reservations & meals,today they have refunded the deposit payment,at least we are getting there!"
At 20.30 Boris made it official. we are on lockdown
"I’m not sure it can be called a lockdown if we can go out for a walk, run or bike ride every day. Now that’s been made clear I fear there’ll be even more people on the streets."
"Agree, it’s to vague!Hopefully by morning we will have the specifics!"
"How is it vague? You can go out, alone or with people from your household once per day for exercise provided you don't interact with any others. It couldn't be simpler. If you need clarification I suggest you may also consider some comprehension lessons (online only, obviously!)"
You can also leave the house to buy simple food items. Nothing extravagant.
What I dont understand is how come the airports are still open?
Details here. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…
What if you have a dog? :o Can you take the dog out more than once a day...?
I'm just wondering how the dogs are supposed to go to the toilet. ☹
"They go where you have house-trained them to go ... and you clean it away, properly afterwards ... Keep wellAnthony K"
But it's not officially a lockdown - or when you look at it anything like a lockdown.It boils down to some shops being closed.
"There are already countless ""can I..."" posts on Facebook from people who can't be bothered to read or are too stupid (NFN).For anyone else, it's quite clear.New instructions:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…List of places that must close or can stay open:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…"
"Airports are open so we can get people home. I suspect some may close in the coming days.As for dogs, if there are two or more people in the household then the dog can go out more than once as long as it's with different people but goodness knows how they can police that."
"It’s about being reasonable and sensible Boris Johnson was not in prescriptive mood If you have a dog then do what you need to do but don’t take the mickey - I can’t see the police challenging dog owners Let’s remember that we have been allowed our freedom and liberty In France where liberté is enshrined in their constitution that they have to have written permission to be out and about We don’t need permission to go out Let’s keep to sensible and we will be ok Getting out into fresh air and exercising is important and we still have that opportunityWe as a nation don’t like the nanny state and neither does Boris We are being treated as adultsEdited: 3:56 am, March 24, 2020 "
"#77, Ed H.“Why is it vague”.Don’t be so F*cking patronising with your alleged comments on taking further education!I have read all the links!Here is a personal example of “vagueness”As most of you know I drive a Black Hack Taxi here in Glasgow.Question is, am I considered a “Key Worker”?After all, not all NHS Staff, or indeed any others regarded as Key Workers all have their own Transport, what about a Shelf Stacker who works overnight in a Supermarket, or a Worker in the Food Manufacturing sector.These people still have to get to work, at awkward hours, however, now the Trains and Buses are working to reduced timetables, often with no early morning nor evening services, how do they get about?Also Glasgow Taxis Ltd (whose auspices I drive under) have School and Social Work Contracts to honour, they also have the Blood Bank Contract (transporting Blood and Platelets to Hospitals in an emergency!So, the question is, am I allowed to continue working? Or am I like the majority of us, housebound!Simple question that I for one cannot find a definitive answer to!So once again, I do not need re-educated!"
"Respect to taxi drivers Taking taxi drivers off the road will lead to increased isolation.You might have an elderly relative across town and might be awkward to use public transport.You might have to care for them or at least get them some shopping or medicine The taxi will be there for youYou might have an urgent / important medical appointment and that is stressful at the best of times How are you going to get to the hospital / dentist ?You might need to get to A&E quickly yourself or with a child Most accidents happen at home and we are going to be home more No ambulance , and the taxi will be there for you I think you get my drift Taxi drivers never refuse a fare They often do a lot of charity runs Taxi drivers could have said they were not going to take the risk and stay home They didn’t Many are self employed and as business dries up they are going to feel real hardship Taxi repayments and no income ????Respect to everyone helping us out And let’s be kind to each otherLet’s have less of these throwaway remarks that aren’t helpful or smart"
"""Travelling to and from work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home"" ""Businesses and other venues not on this list may remain open""A taxi driver clearly can't work from home and it is not listed as a business which must close. So yes, obvious conclusion to me that you can continue."
"Bus drivers are working, wearing masks, not handling cash and will try to keep to timetables where possible ... why not Taxi drivers ... if passenger seats are a decent distance behind the driver and they, also, perform emergency services.Keep well allAnthony K"
"I emailed our Secretary this morning with my concerns.He got back to me saying that he has contacted the Office of the First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon) and is awaiting a response.He also contacted our colleagues at Central Taxis in Edinburgh and they have actually took legal advice.Their advice was you could still work and provide a service, they linked in a Government website, but on reading it it still didn’t mention Taxis specifically, besides, the advice in the link was dated 19th March, so already that had been surpassed by first the announcement of Pub Closures, and now, by the PM’s Lockdown statement!"
