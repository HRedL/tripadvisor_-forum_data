Booked my holiday with balkan in December to go pomorie sun on arrival was told I've been upgrade to globus now I'm not being funny but I've planned my holiday for the last 9 month with all my family only for balkan to totally spoil everything put in a hotel that I don't want in an area I don't want will be visiting the main office ironically located next to the globus on Monday I won't let this rest if not sorted it wil be my last visit with balkan
"I’ve heard that a few people have been moved to Globus and Fenix. I can’t see how they can overbook, I really hope you get sorted"
I'm really not happy booked the last 5 years with balkan no problem this year I've paid to take the whole family away promised my grandaughter that we will go swimming together shown her photos of the pool and it's all been turned on its head
That brings the epidemic of good reports about Balkan to an end for now.Tigerti
I’d never agree to take the Globus. Insist on a different hotel!! If you’ve booked a package with them you have strong legal rights and one of them is receiving the holiday you booked in specific detail.Jules
I don’t see how they can “upgrade” you from a hotel which has had a full refurb. Not really fair especially to spring that on you on arrival. I wouldn’t accept it either
"Seems to be happening quite a bit. Not exactly sure how they manage to overbook rooms! For Balkan its a zero cost option as they own both hotels, as HLD said its not really an upgrade. Good luck with dealing with them. Hope you get it sorted."
"By star rating its an upgrade which probably satisfies elements in terms and conditions, though whether it is a better hotel overall is questionable, and of course does not mean such changes are fair or acceptable.Atb steve"
"Greg, here are your rights set out by the Package Travel Regulations 2018. Print a copy and present it asking them how they intend to supply what you contractually booked and how much compensation they intend to pay!https:/…package-travel-regulationsJules"
IT could be a problem with the hotel I saw this a few years ago a lot of people were tranfers to a different hotels and not the one they had books As I was near I went and took a look at the hotel I saw a massive crack in the hotel and could see it was unsafe But would say that and sometimes if there was a out brake of something no one will say  Best thing would be if someone was near they could go take a look  The other thing could be the hotel has cancelled its contract with Balkan  I would think as it was given to you on arrival that it's something beyond Balkans control After all they don't own the hotels
"The hotel has recently undergone a major refurbishment and has been busy all season. This is one of 3 hotels owned by Balkan, pomerie sun, Fenix and Globus, therefore would not have lost its contract with Balkan. Its purely a case of overbooking at lower price hotels to fill the aircraft seats and dealing with the customer once they have paid! Clearly Jet 2 entering the Bulgarian market is putting pressure on Balkan to fill places, this is very evident by the quantity of double/triple touch flights right through until late July this year."
have they spit your family up was it on one booking
"Just got back from pomerie and was very disappointed- they might be doing you a favour , only really good thing about pomerie was location"
A refurb TUI were doing a refurb on a hotel started two years a go then problems Only opend this June they sold all the rooms last year but on start of season only one third of the rooms could be used I stayed in the globus heel was ok
"The difference is Shannon, you booked the Globus so got what you paid for. The poster Greg booked the specific hotel and area he wanted 9 months ago and shouldn’t have been shunted elsewhere.Jules"
Same as what TUI did to there customers  The builders said it would be ready  And it was not remember the holidays are sold a year in advance So you take the word of the builders that it will be ready  And then it's not what do you do tell the customers you can't have a holiday or try and get them another hotel  It would be more helpful if you were told the reson as to what was wrong  Same thing happened to me in Spain. I got a different hotel different resort  It was still fine yes I could have jumped up and down and said I'm not have it and stayed home  Go just gone to a different hotel which I did and had a good time If as said this is happening to a lot of people it's not over booking
The Pomorie is ready and people have been using it for months. This isn’t the same situation as the one you’re describing. Nothing to do with building work. It’s simply a matter of over booking and bad management whether it’s Balkan or any other company.Jules
"Maybe Greg could update the forum as to any developments, the office would have been open this morning, maybe he is enjoying staying at the Globus hotel."
"He really hope he is. My brother has stayed at the Globus twice and it’s a decent hotel but noisy on the front, poor food and very few sun beds. The ones they have were mainly broken.Jules"
People were using the TUI hotel but it was not ready How do you know it's just a matter of over booking or bad management Or are you just assuming it is
"Well it may be unlikely but if we get moved in September I wouldn’t just accept it. People like hotels for different reasons and pick each one based on that. Everyone raves about royal sun and yes it’s a really nice complex but the road outside is the reason I wouldn’t stay there again or any other hotel across the road. The companies must know in advance that there isn’t enough rooms, if it was a legitimate reason, like a safety issue then I think the customer would be told anyway as it’s unavoidable. The fact that no reason was given indicates it was human error. Maybe at this particular hotel they overbook because people book then read reviews and panic, and pull out. If they overbook they would always have the rooms filled and if this had been going on years then it would have been almost predictable. However this year if they have done the same, less or no people have cancelled due to the anticipated refurb. That’s one theory anyway"
"Recent reviews for both hotels indicate greater satisfaction at the Globus Hotel, from what i can see.Atb steve"
"I do know it’s not for the reasons you’ve cited Shannon because the Pomorie has been open all this season.If it’s not due to overbooking or poor management of bed spaces, why do you assume the booked hotel can’t take people? It’s a common problem in hotel management and the expression I believe is ‘walking people’ where companies overbook and then just shunt them elsewhere hoping they won’t complain. Usually happens with companies who have links or ownership of several hotels.https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/92…JulesEdited: 1 year ago "
so you don't know why it could be for many reasons
"What reasons exactly and why weren’t they told? They are not getting the specific service they booked and were looking forward which is the issue here. I’m more interested in the right of people to receive the holiday they worked for and were looking forward to than trying to defend companies at any expense. If there’s something other than overbooking involved, why didn’t the company tell them?You wouldn’t have been happy being moved from the area you like to somewhere that didn’t suit your family at the last minute.Jules"
Sorry I've not posted back earlier but the wife was taken ill yesterday all OK now family not split up got 3 rooms together the globus is a lovely hotel in a fantastic spot. Because the wife was taken ill I've agreed with her not to raise the issue with balkan till we get home. Even though I still feel I've been let down I'm bitting my lip and just trying too enjoy the holiday.
Have to say if there was such a big change as a hotel move I’d be expected to be given a reason. I don’t see why there wouldn’t be one?
Aw Greg what a horrible position to be in. I hope your wife gets well soon.
"Greg it might be a good thing to forget it for now and not let it ruin your holiday,,, just have a great holiday and sort it when you get home....."
"Yes make the most of it now Greg and sorry to have your wife ill on top of all this upset. It isn’t right to have caused you this angst but hope the rest of the holiday can go smoothly. However, register your protest because there needs to be a formal record.Jules"
Shannon its not acceptable to move people without giving them a choice. We have previously stayed in the Globus and yes its a decent hotel but the Hotel we book is because its in the area we want to be in and The Globus is too far to walk from there. So if we had to be moved for whatever reason I would like to be consulted and move to a hotel in the same area. For me this is just common curtesy when we have spent a lot of money booking the hotel we would like.
Lin you have the choice to say no get your money back and go home if that's what you want then fine do it I am sure you would not be saying this if the move was for safety reasons you would be happy with it We don't know the reson for the move but it no different than any other company They never say why All company's work the same way
"I would not want to go home after looking forward to my hols why should I take that option. You miss the point wether its for safety or any other reason I would expect to be given a choice of Hotel in the area we had booked, as a matter of curtesy rather than be moved anywhere else without choice. My opinion."
You may not have noticed but this is August. High season There will be llittel to nothing to choose fromSo what would you like them to do throw someone out to give you a choice  The refurb only started in November. I have worked in Bulgaria And no one ever rushes It's ready when it's ready  Balkan could have cancelled the holiday they did not  A holiday was still to be had
"Mostly I value your opinions on certain questions, but sometimes I think you are blinkered in your opinions and don't consider other people at all your way or no way. I will say no more. Maybe not a right or wrong answer."
Jules I am not defending anything. I am saying what could be I find this forum to be a very anti Balkan site and I don't like it  So I stand up and say may be its not what you think it is that's all Lin there must always be a different view to think about or why post at all  Some one posts something you post a different view and another person come in with yet another view  That's how we learn You are right in a way I follow the fox molder way trust no one belive nothing
"Hello, I'm just back from the fenix and whilst we were there we met two ladies who had also been transferred on arrival from the pomorie to the fenix. They were only told once they arrived at the hotel. They were not pleased and were blocked by the rep from leaving the coach. Once they got off the coach, it drove away with their luggage which was then dumped outside the front door of the fenix. I felt sorry for them, not the greatest start to their holiday and they deserved better.I have to say though, we went with balkan, my 16th time and my mums 48th and we had no problems at all. Smooth sailing from the flight in to the flight back. As far as I could see the pomorie seemed to be in perfect working order with people in all the different rooms, our balcony looked onto the back of the pomorie."
This is not just about Balkan Shannon. We should feel the same about all companies who do this so you can drop off your Balkan crusader role on this one.Jules
"The forum isn't anti Balkan Holidays. I support them, they have never given me a reason to complain but I would in this instance."
not anti Balkan but this a problem that shouldn't happen and any company that has problems causing upset paying guest needs people know
there are a few people here that are anti Balkan we don't know what has happened that's why I said go up and find out first hand just what's going on  as I said all holiday company's are the same they all do it yet you only get this response when its Balkan tell me I am wrong then read back through all the posts I know tui do it saw it myself there hotel looked full from the front but it just was not ready  so they put people in where ever they could they were not happy don't blame them as they paid twice as much as I did to stay in the same hotel but hey that's the way it go's I took the time to go and look at that hotel myself and close up it was the right thing to do not to put people in there yet tui did not tell the people why and yes it was Bulgaria the point being things are not always what you think they are so just jumping on its been over booked we don't know that and people say Balkan holidays own the hotels its a different part of Balkan not Balkan holidays I believe its the same director but different company so yes something has gone wrong but I don't know what nor do any of us small scale overbooking could be large scale don't think so maybe some people are not leavening staying for a extra week not right but possible a lot of people drive so unlike us don't have a aircraft take off time
"Its not just Balkan at all. The same happened when Aqua Nevis was being built, Palace, Aqua Paradise, Wave resort. People were moved and weren't happy. They weren't told how progress was and people had to rely on people living over there for info and pictures. Yes other companies do it but its not just Balkan getting slated. I remember the Aqua Nevis thread being huge! That's the reason I would never go to a hotel that is just being built or having its first season. Balkan features heavily on here because they are the main tour operator for Bulgaria, look on any other social media and Thomas Cook and TUI have hundreds of dissatisfied customers commenting on their posts. As I said I support Balkan but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Also yes, Balkan Holidays have recently confirmed that they do not own Fenix, Globus or Pomorie Sun hotels."
Where’s the Balkan representative that has been answering people’s queries on other forum posts.??? He/She could mabie answer why this is happening.Tigerti
It isn’t just a sole Balkan problem the reason this thread has gone on is this family have had their holiday booked for 9 months and surely they should have their reservations.....Balkan might still make a response and put this right....Mel.....
They might but their social media team is off this week and they may not see this by the time it gets bumped down. Anyone wanting answers should go into their office directly or contact them via email/FB messenger.
Hi folks having a fantastic holiday Sat in bacardi bar waiting for the boro game. Im not anti balkan having booked with them the last 4 years just thing I deserve answers so will be asking the questions next week. Only major problem is this god damn weather hot hot hot. If I get the answers I'll repost on here
You are not making a great case for a future complaint by posting what a fantastic time you are having on here though greg☺.Atb steve
"Totally understand the frustration but to me the main thing is having a fabulous holiday. So pleased you are doing OP. Who knows the reason for the “bumping”. Personally I think ENJOY, forget the fact you are in another hotel. You have other options besides Balkan when you book again. It is their loss. Have fun and stop complaining about the heat bahaha. Just making us jealous."
"Hi Greg,We are deeply sorry for the late change to your acommodation but are glad to hear that you are enjoying your stay at the Hotel Globus. While rare, some hoteliers will unfortunately deliberately overbook their rooms because they take into consideration that a small percentage of bookings will cancel or not show up. This avoids them having empty rooms.However we do not condone this practice but there is very little that we can do about how bookings are managed by hotels, especially if they are not exclusive to Balkan Holidays. Please be assured that we take up instances of overbooking with hotels' management in the strongest possible terms.Kind regardsBalkan Holidays"
Isn't the Pomerie Sun and Globus owned by the Balkan Group of companies?
Shannon we were booked to the amaris from 26th Aug to the 6th sept 2wks before travel was told they were changing us to pomorie so how can they say double booked to a family that booked 9 mnts ago
"Hi Alfie, nice to see you again!Each company operates independently of each other and have no parent company. Even though the individual companies share similar names and/or branding we are not subsidaries of any Balkan Holidays Group. In our case, we are an independent UK Tour Operator that has contracts with the BH Hotels as we do with the other hotels and apartments we feature.Kind regardsBalkan Holidays"
