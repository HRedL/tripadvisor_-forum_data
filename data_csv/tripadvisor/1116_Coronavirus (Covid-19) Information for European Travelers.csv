Sorry to say but if you have not already taken out an insurance policy you will be unable to make a claim on a policy you buy today after knowing the issue pre-existed. Having said that if you already have travel insurance before the issue commenced you need to check your policy wording as some do and some don't cover epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases. Another better option is that airlines are in the process of changing schedules due to reduced passenger numbers so a possibility of an involuntary refund due to a changed flight schedule may allow you to get a full refund.

In my case it would be Air Rarotonga or Air Tahiti, as I will be taking the flight from Rarotonga to Tahiti, the one which only goes on Saturdays. I will need to get it in Rarotonga, because I will be spending the week before in the Cook Islands, and the note may only be 5 days old.I am posting my coronavirus question here, because I live in Europe (Germany). Still it could need the help of Cook Islands or French Polynesia regional experts."

jet2 has stopped all flights to Spain from the UK with flights turning around half-way to return to the UK - so no flights in from jet2 = no flights out.

>>> jet2 has stopped all flights to Spain from the UK with flights turning around half-way to return to the UK - so no flights in from jet2 = no flights out. <<<Not quite true; Jet2 is sending empty planes to repatriate UK travellers. They turned back the flights because they did not want to deposit several planeloads of extra people into a country that was going into a state of emergency.

"I could not believe that when my flight to travel from Rome to Melbourne was cancelled by the airline, I could not get a refund from the travel insurance because they say it was 14 days after the purchase. Not to say that having purchased an insurance called cover 'complete' did not include any support in case of issues due to epidemics in the country I was travelling to.So how many travel insurances have pocketed moneys on contracts that will never be?"
"Re Post 28 (you don't say when the flights were booked BTW), if you buy insurance after the virus pandemic has become public knowledge and after you bought your flights then of course it won't cover cancellations due to it - it is a pre-existing and material risk and they don't pay out for those . Are you saying that you bought the insurance more than 14 days AFTER booking the flights CMH ? If so that was rather foolish IMHO - for any expensive trip you always need to have travel insurance cover in place from day one or within 14 days if that is what the company specify .Most insurers are making it clear that no new policies include Cvirus issues for obvious reasons - you cannot expect to buy a relatively cheap policy and then be able to claim thousands on it for a known risk at the time you bought it - insurance doesn't work that way! If your flight was cancelled (as opposed to you simply not being able to travel on it) then you ought to be able to get a refund or option to rebook later from the airline but if you do find that you are entitled to that but bought your tickets through a third party you are going to have to go through them and they probably WILL charge fees for the admin time and effort they put in to do it for you ( the amounts payable will have been set out in the T&Cs of any ticket flogger you used)Edited: 7:32 am, March 16, 2020 "

"I have tickets to tour Highclere Castle in mid-April. I have tried to contact them via phone & Facebook but to no avail. Have only seen other posts on TripAdviser and Facebook relaying the Castle not rescheduling or refunding tours. Any suggestions? Obviously, this is an unprecedented situation in which travel is restricted and social distancing is strongly advised. Why won’t they make adjustments? How can I get in contact with them? Would be glad to reschedule if possible."
"I do not think that your post is relevant to the ""Air Travel Forum"" 546lovetotravel.

Have you tried emailing them ?Edited: 4:54 pm, March 17, 2020 "
I couldn’t find any other forum which seemed more “relevant.” Just was hoping for some advice. Obviously none will be given here. Won’t burden you further with such irrelevant questions.

"Post 33 - please do not get snarky 546lovetotravel. Your post isn't relevant on this thread (an Air Travel forum is hardly a good fit for any question about guided tours of a stately home in the middle of the British countryside) and I told you in Post 32 where you would have more chance of getting relevant replies so please do not say you have not had ""some advice"" . In fact I even took the trouble to search for and post a link to the attractions website so you had easy access to their phone number, email address etc. Unless the attraction is cancelling tours for the dates you mention (and things here are changing day to day so that still might happen closer to the date you mention) you need to take it up with them direct to ask whether you can reschedule for a later date or not - nobody on here can help.If you have simply cancelled your trip to the UK itself (I am thinking for a reason that effectively amounts to a ""disinclination to travel"" rather than not being able to travel for reasons outside your control such as a travel ban or insured medical emergency) then unless your insurance covers the cost of this booking you will quite probably lose your money .Edited: 10:26 am, March 18, 2020 "
They've offered to rebook within 6 months. Borders closed! 11/2 hours on phone but no reply! They haven't replied to whatsapp either. They say they have 24/7 contact but not the case I'm sorry to say.

"My husband and I had a reservation to go from JFK to Barcelona in April on Iberia and another reservation to go from Rome to Baltimore (through London) in May on British Air. I cancelled the flights due to the virus and received evouchers for the cost of both trips from Iberia. (The flights were booked through a third party site and both airlines used the same confirmation number.) Anyway, does anyone know if the evouchers can be used with partner airlines American or British Air or are they only good on Iberia? Also, I paid extra for seat assignments on these flights. Can those be carried over to any new flights we book?"
"I think that this is the sort of question you need to take up with the airline(s) . Obviously it isn't screaming urgent as you aren't likely to want to travel any time soon so if I were you I would enquire by email (useful too as you will have a record of the ""conversation"" )Good luck"

"You will not get the information you are seeking by posting on this thread First off - you CANNOT have a trip ""booked through TripAdvisor"" . Trip Advisor is NOT an online travel agent - yes, it is a platform whereby people can find holidays through their ""partners"" ie suppliers who advertise on the TA website, but your booking itself will not itself be with TA . You need to examine your booking paperwork carefully and see WHO your booking was actually contracted with and contact them direct"

"I have a multi county trip booked for the month of June, 2020. The plans are to travel to France and then by train to parts of Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Portugal. With all the restrictions because of the Covid-19 virus, I'm wondering if this is a trip that needs to be postponed or canceled. If airlines are having troubles, what about the tourist sites in these countries? If I'm spending the money, I certainly want to feel safe and enjoy the sites.Any suggestions?"
"I doubt you’ll be travelling. Where are you coming from, and how will you get to France? Many tourist attractions are closed, as are hotels and restaurants. Apart from the risk of picking up the virus, no -one knows how long lockdowns will continue and it’s only just over eight weeks to the beginning of June."
"I have a flight with easyJet going out Liverpool - Venice out 25th April, back 28th April, it’s not showing as cancelled and I’m being prompted to add API and check in, there’s no point calling or emailing, I kind of assumed I’d have had a flight cancelled notice, anyone in a similar position or can guide, do we have charge back rights on credit card in event of cancellation, I don’t want a credit as won’t be good for 2021 summer as not released yet"
"we have April 14th flights just cancelled today with Easyjet. SO you need to wait for that email. However since our last cancellation email, two weeks ago, this email says you much call to get a refund, there is no longer a refund link on the website. Very sneaky of them."
"We're due to travel to Croatia (June) & Spain (September), My husband has received a letter from the government telling him he is a high risk case for coronavirous , & not to leave the house for three months. Could this information be used by us to cancel our flights & get a refund?"
#50Possibly through your travel insurers but not a valid reason for a refund on that basis only from an airline.
"I agree - that would be the only option and whether it would pay out will possibly all hang on what the underlying condition requiring the travel ban for so long is , whether it has been declared to the travel insurers as a pre existing condition and if they have agreed to cover anything related to it or it is excluded . In any case the three months mentioned would include the September booking anyway.You could try contacting the airline (or tour operator) and ask if the June booking could be credited against something else much later on but that would be at their discretion - I doubt they would agree to cancel it and just give a refund as that is what your insurance is for really Another option if it is a package holiday through the likes of Tui etc with full ABTA/ATOL protection you could just wait and see if the holiday is cancelled by them anyway due to flights being cancelled by the airline - that would be my move (or lack of) at the moment because if your travel insurer would not cover you if you cancel the June trip completely you could lose a lot of moneyEdited: 8:55 am, April 11, 2020 "
"Thanks for your replies, I have declared all my conditions to the insurance, just didn't expect to be declared a risk case by the doctors surgery, I will check with the airline & insurance.i have to isolate myself for three months? Thanks again"
"I would definitely speak to the insurance company and find out where you stand and if it would be OK to wait and see if by the time you get closer to the June trip it hasn't cancelled itself as then you might not need to pay the insurance excess for nothing. The September trip is more tricky because the three months isolation period will be over before then and you never know, travel restrictions might be eased by then Good luck with it (and the self isolation)"

"Hi, Anyone else only had a refund from Easyjet for their outbound flights for whole group but as individual flights not how you paid for the entire group.But not refunded any inbound flights for any of the group! On the one occasion you manage to get through, they tell you you have had your refund, when you say check the inbound flight they then admit you only received your outbound refunds and not any of the inbound refunds they said I will contact the finance team to sort it and get back to you!  But never get back to you by phone or email, and still don't receive any refunds for the inbound flights!ANYONE got any way to contact them other than the usual means? its a lot of money to be ripped off for!"
"Les N if the airports are closed the airline wont be able to fly so should cancel the flight they should offer a refund or chance to alter your dates or vouchers for the price! if you want refund do not accept vouchers etc.Re any Hotel or Villa you booked go to their website contact the Hotel or villa renter which I did! Ask them to agree that if your flights are cancelled due to Covid that they will issue you a full refund or at least an agreed sum, if its in a written message and you paid by visa you then have a backup option to contact the visa company to sort it out, if the hotel or renter do not refund you the agreed amount! My Middle and youngest son had their mates double stag do's cancelled despite the date of refund policy having passed, the Hotel did agree to refund them the whole amount saying if they re book later to go direct to them for a better deal! Easyjet on the other hand cancelled the flights but so far refunded my middle son who paid for all flights on his card, only received outbound flight refunds and as individual flights, he totted up them, as their didn't seem enough flights refunded, and not one inbound flight had been refunded, so he s having to keep trying to get them to sort it out but you cant get through very often, and they are all mouth and no trousers saying they will sort it but so far have not. I found the CEO email and customer care so he emailed them so lets see if they respond! Its all about letting the airline cancel, Not you, and getting hotels villa rental managers to agree in a written message to refund you all or part of the money you paid even after the normal cut of refund date !"

"Portland to BostonBoston to BarcelonaBarcelona to Kiev (Ukraine)I have a U.S. passport. Leaving June 1st (hopefully).My question:I don't have any luggage to check all the way. But all these flights are on separate tickets. When I arrive in Barcelona will I HAVE to leave the international transit zone and go to the check-in counter and clear customs and all that? Ukraine doesn't require a visa for me so I'm good on that. My concern is that with the Covid-19 restrictions that because I am a Non-EU resident and thus can't leave the international transit zone and enter Schengen, that I wouldn't be able to leave the transit zone to go through check-in and customs if that is what's required to continue onto my separate flight to Ukraine.

Hi folks re refunds from airlines if you are having no joy 1st on facebook there is a page called not so easyjet join that for info emails to use on getting refunds asap! there are virgin refund forums on as well and must be others set up by people to help each other swap info etc. 2nd BUT if you paid by credit card or Debit card you can contact the card provider and ask for a charge back to visa card or your bank account if you used a debit card! many people have done this so I read on the forums
"""if you paid by credit card or Debit card you can contact the card provider and ask for a charge back to visa card or your bank account if you used a debit card! many people have done this so I read on the forums""Yes and there have been several accounts on here about companies challenging those chargebacks and then the charge getting reapplied. The defence they provided was, essentially ""no, we haven't refunded yet, but we will"" and the Credit Card issuer is accepting that. SO you may get the charge removed when you challenge it, but it may reappear.I mean it's worth a try, but not a 100% certainty."
I booked flights with Easyjet for a return trip to Malaga from the Uk in January for June. The outbound flight has been cancelled and I have submitted an line form for a refund.The return flight from Malaga for 18th June has not been cancelled. As both flights were booked at the same time on a single booking am I entitled to a refund for both flights.I have tried various sites but cannot find an answer to this.
"I am in the same position with a trip to Menorca with EJ 2-10 June. Oddly when I checked the manage my booking page on the EJ website this morning it offered me the refund option for both flights even though the 10 June one is not cancelled yet! As I am one of life's cautious creatures I have only clicked on ""request refund"" for my cancelled outgoing flight and am holding fire on the other one until that flight is definitely showing as ""cancelled"" rather than sold out as I know that my tickets were definitely not normally refundable and I do not want to prejudice getting all of my money back!"

Who knows? My crystal ball is in the shop
"Hi AnthonyAs you make the assumption that there will be no second wave and you have no issues with any quarantine requirement that may still be in force when you return, I would say the prospects are good. Spain is looking to open up shortly so I would say Barcelona in October shouldn't be a problem. On the face of it I would say the same about Paris in September, but France has threatened to reciprocate any quarantine regulations imposed by other countries so it may depend on whether the UK quarantine has been lifted by then."

"Where are you travelling from Kandis? Different countries have different rules, and the situation is changing from week to week."
I am traveling from the US to Uk.
Travelling on 5th June will mean you will arrive before the 14 day self isolation instruction comes in on 8th. But to stay in England you would have to have somewhere to stay and sleep there every night under lockdown rules. You can go out during the day but must return each evening. You can’t use public transport as it’s reserved for essential trips. You must socially distance at all times when out. If your children will be staying with their mother they will only be able to see you outside I.e not wherever you are staying.You may be able to travel elsewhere in Europe but at the moment there are lots of restrictions in each country and you would need to check if a US citizen travelling within the U.K. is allowed into that country.Point 3 depends on the rules in whichever country you plan to meet up.It all looks a very problematic plan to me.
">>>It all looks a very problematic plan to me.<<<I agree. I would keep it all as simple as possible and forget about travelling about.FInd a place to stay for two weeks and then see what the situation is like. Maybe hotels will have reopened then. Or maybe some of the restrictions which have been eased will be reimposed.If it were me, I'd challenge the custody order as I don't think it's possible to comply at this time."
The other option would be to say that you're Dominic Cummings and your reason for travelling is childcare issues. It's been proven to be unchallengable.
We are UK citizens and in September are flying to Tunisia with Air France from London via Paris CDG airport an dare totally confused about whether we can travel or not. I have messaged Air France an the airline can't even answer my question. The information I have read on the AF website suggests that we would currently not be able to fly to Tunisia and would be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival at CDG airport and would not be able to transfer onto the Tunis flight. There is also a declaration form to complete to present to customs but the document does not contain ANY section which relates to passengers transiting through CGD airport and seems to just relate to people who reside in France or other nationalities who own a second home in France. There is NO option for anyone travelling to a holiday destination transiting through CDG airport. it seems our best option is for Air France to not operate our flights so that we can get a refund. Has anyone else had similar issues or is confused about transiting through Paris airports and French quarantine rules??
"croatiafan9I too are due to travel in September to Spain, i think its just a case of wait and see what happens through the July period. If everything starts to return to something more normal then more countries will reduce restrictions.Obviously if the opposite happens and we have a second wave then everything will remain in place.All we can do is wait unfortunately."
To be honest your flights are a tad into the future so would keep watching what happens with June July and August to give a better idea of what September will bring! our flights to Tenerife are last week of July we have now no accommodation no insurance so hope they cancel the flights! but if they go ahead and we feel its unsafe or impossible to go due to quarantine or restrictions etc to go we will have to look at what options are available to us! We just hope the airline are not purely concerned with ripping off customers AS IF EH
"Hello everyone!I was wondering if anyone can help me understand the regulations around international travel.My partner is currently working abroad in Turkey, I was due to visit her in March when everything took a down turn, so I changed my flight to 20th of June thinking it should be ok.The information on the gov website states: Whether travel is essential or not is a personal decision and circumstances differ from person to person. It is for individuals themselves to make an informed decision based on the risks and FCO advice. Anyone still planning to travel should check the validity of their travel insurance.But at the same time it also says that it's advised against travel for all but non-essential travel.So therefore i am confused about what should i do. I was planning to still go taking all the necessary precautions and then some.Does anyone know if this applies only to the fact that the health insurances are not valid due to the gvmnt advice, or i am just plain and simple not allowed any international travel?Has anyone traveled recently (i.e. after mid may notice)? What was your experience?Does anyone know a number i can contact where i can get some clarification?Full disclosure, i am not trying to bend the rules or find a loophole to be inconsiderate considering the current global situation. Have self-isolated consciously and always wore a mask, and avoided any people. I just wanna see my partner who i haven't seen in 6 months, and want to know if i am allowed or not.Also i am aware that upon return i need to quarantine for 2 weeks, and i am in a position to do so.Thank you!"
"It would help so much if you included your location with your avatar, or at least in your comments."
"You have to make up your mind based on all of the information you can get hold of. You are correct that your insurance won't be valid whilst the government advice not to travel unless it's an essential journey. It may feel very essential to you to go and see your partner, but you need to check what things are going to be like for you at your destination. Is Turkey open for UK visitors? Will you have to quarantine on arrival? What sort of facilities will be open there? What about quarantine on your return?These are all the things I'd be thinking about and trying to find out before making my decision."

"@Ruby, as stated on your thread asking the same question, this would not currently be allowed. You must clear immigration and customs in the US. There is no transit area. Hope you are going to British VI."
Does anyone know if you are allowed to transit through the US going to the Caribbean or does the travel restrictions apply to that as well. I will be coming from Europe Germany to Caribbean transiting in the US
"There is no “transit” in the US. If you land here you are here, and if you are not allowed you can’t do that kind of connection"
"""I will be coming from Europe Germany to Caribbean transiting in the US.""From which city in Germany are you going to depart and to which city in the Caribbean are you heading?"
"We have a holiday booked at end of July. This is to a low infection rate area (Greece), and we live in an area now with low infection rates. However we will be flying from an airport in England. What are people's thoughts about risk of catching/spreading Covid19? Would we be better staying at home? We have not travelled anywhere other than the supermarket and local exercise since mid-March, so looking forward to being able to safely travel again."
"Staying at home is obviously safer than going to public places like airports and planes . Odds are not calculable, all depends on your adversity to risk. Will the person in the next row have Covid and cough on you?"
"Would you be aware of the Transit rules for the USA for European travellers during the current corona crisis? Appreciate USA is closed to all travellers but what if just flying through?I'm coming from London, looking to transit through Newark ONLY, may be a 1 night stop over, before flying on to the Bahamas.It's impossible to get direct flights at the moment. Any help would be appreciated! :)"

The page linked at #106 advises that the page could not be found. Silly idea anyway.
It's advertising...so not appropriate and silly anyway

"So in their updated list of countries that can enter EU(for July 16)- they did not add new countries. In fact, they removed Serbia and Montenergo. Serbia got 19k cases, Montenegro - 1.2k cases. Yet they have China in the list that can enter?What gives?"
For the last few weeks I have been checking www.covidtravel.world for travel restrictions. I think it is very accurate about Europe. I guess this could be helpful for some people here!
"I am flying to Cyprus on the 3rd august from Manchester, the UK are meant be moving into category B with Cyprus on the 1st, which will mean that myself and my son need a negative Covid result to fly, can I use an NHS email ? if not what do I do, I don't know how else to get a test result where I am(near Preston)."

"Being from a mentally-challenged country like the USA, I'm obviously uncertain as to when I will be able to travel to Europe without restictions. I would, however, like to travel to Europe for an extended period of time and respect the restictions. My question is how do I quarantine? Is it stay in place in my hotel except for essentials like goceries and medical assistance, but not to include outdoor dining, a walk in the park or a museum visit. Or stay in place but I can go out so long as I mask up and social distance whenever I do? Or, am I carted off to an airport hotel after Customs where my comings and goings are monitored? Please say, no. Also, if I have a connecting flight, can I take that flight immediately and quarantine at my final destination or do I need to quarantine before I can travel onward. Specifically, US to Paris to Calvi. Thanks for whatever guidance anyoner can offer."
https:/…has the required info as it relates to France. Is different for every country in Europe (and depending on where you are coming from AND your specific circumstances.At the moment looks like entry is basically not possible for travellers from the US (unless your circumstance is specific). For the travellers who are allowed in and are required to quarantine looks to be that you can quarantine in your own residence (i.e. you don't get locked away unless you have no where to go). ALso looks likes it is possible to transit if < 24 hours.
Thank you. Very helpful
"anyone know about easyjet, they announced could change flights to tenerife on monday for no charge if you cant go because of having to self isolating on return, my flight for Saturday is still saying I have to pay"
"suggest you start a new thread or find one of the Easyjet threads and add to it, Ruth. This is sort of a ""catch-all"" thread without much advice."
"Hi All,I've searched and searched but am having trouble finding the answer so any advice would be greatly appreciated. My girlfriend is American and I'd really like to go visit her, but being English, it's not been possible (she is allowed to visit me with 2 weeks quarantine) Looking at the proclamation wording, it seems I'm not banned from the US because of my passport, but because I'm in Europe.There are a number of countries (such as Jamaica) I'm allowed to, and they're allowed into the USA, so I'm wondering if I could technically fly to Jamaica, spend 2 weeks there, then fly onto the USA on my ESTA.I appreciate this is a sensitive subject and I'm sure many of you will recommend to just not travel while covid is a thing which I understand, I'm just looking at long term options if things don't open up.Thanks in advance, sorry if my searching has missed this question before."
"Hiya - so the good news is, LOTS of people seem to be trying this option.I’m part of two Facebook Groups “Couples Separated by Travel Bans” and “Love is Not Tourism”.Heaps of advice and experiences on there. A lot of people are going via Mexico for example, staying for 2 weeks there then entering the US.FB groups are private but you can request to join given you are in the impacted group (I’m the same - I’m in UK, boyfriend is in USA)"
">>>I'm wondering if I could technically fly to Jamaica, spend 2 weeks there, then fly onto the USA on my ESTA.<<<Technically you could do that. My understanding is, however that all ESTA's have been cancelled. But maybe I'm wrong or out of date. If I'm not, it may work against you."
"Thank you Amanda, I'll check out those groups.Roj, estas haven't been cancelled, but I've read if border think you're trying to side step the ban they CAN cancel your esta and deny entry, which would make for a very expensive 2 week time waste :(Also, I didn't think Mexico was an allowed route, but I'll double check as that would be great."
"Johnnnnn If you are worried that going to Jamaica for 2 weeks then trying to get to the US via back door might be seen as being devious. Then why not ring the US embassy and ask them if it would be possible, then you would know the factual information from the horses mouth so as to speak, rather than risk the money and time only to be turned away and maybe unable to enter US for a set period of time!"
"Jonnnnnnnn, it's always the case the border officials have the final say on whether you can enter with an ESTA, so it seems like a good idea to ask the US authorities what their official position is on what you are thinking of doing.The worst that can happen is that they say no, but if they say it's OK it might well help to have that in writing.If they won't commit either way, then you're no worse off than you are at the moment."
"Thank you for this! I am in the same predicament, my boyfriend is in the USA and im stuck here in the uk. I want to get out there and im looking at Barbados as an option for a 15 day holiday and then hoping to get into the USA, im just petrified of getting there and getting sent back. I will ask to join the groups. thanks fo your help!!!!"
"No probs aishaksmart!You've probably seen, but worth checking:https:/…covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020We ruled out Barbados as people from High Risk countries have to go into a mandatory 14 day quarantine. UK is classified as a Medium Risk (at the moment!) but this made me too nervous in case it changed - and my boyfriend would anyway be High Risk.Worth looking at if you're on your own but it all just sounded a bit too compicated! :) Wasn't sure where to get a test in the UK either without symptoms, unless you wanted to pay £££Playa Del Carmen for us!"
"Hi, can anyone answer this question for me ... I am due to travel back to the UK from France and if we go into quarantine in the UK I have an internal flight the next day once I land in UK to get me home to my destination ....how does that work ??? thankyou ...my thought is to cancel the hotel and stay overnight in the airport but I don't know where I would stand !!!!"
Suggest you post this on the UK forum as your question is more locally specific than this more broad Air Travel Forum. There you will get the local knowledge you seek
If you check the UK gov website below it talks about how to isolate etc. I think you’re ok to stop/stay overnight on the way to your final destination if it is far from your entry point into the UK so you could stay at the hotel as plannedhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…
As far as I know there is no requirement for self isolation for a UK passport holder arriving from France.
Add to my post above....no requirement until today.
Can you travel to Mexico and stay for 14 days then go the USA at the minute if your from U.K.? I noticed flights are allowed from Mexico to USA and have read others have done this
"I believe that is an option for those who have plenty of time, yes."

"I booked a flight through Tripadvisor with the airline being Icelander. Our flight is most likely going to have to be cancelled. TA site states to go through the airline for voucher/refund, however, Icelander site states if you booked through a 3rd party you have to go through them. Where do I go to request a refund/voucher?"
You need to contact the agent you used for the purchase of the ticket...note it is NOT Tripadvisor. And I would wait until the flight is actually cancelled.
"Tilly is right, TripAdvisor doesn't sell air tickets. You can find ADVERTISEMENTS for ticket sellers on TripAdvisor, just like you can find ads on Google or SkyScanner or on late night TV. You should check your billing info or receipt you got when you bought this ticket -- that will show you the name of the company you bought from.And do wait for the airline to cancel. Your rights to refunds are much stronger if they do the canceling."
