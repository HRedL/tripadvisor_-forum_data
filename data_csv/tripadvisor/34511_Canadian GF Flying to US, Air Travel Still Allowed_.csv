"Question about US/Canada Air Travel Concerning Partner Across BorderI apologize for the structure of this question as I realize as it goes against CDC suggestions, but this is concerning air travel between US and Canada right now. I am an American citizen and my GF of several years is a grad student in Ontario. Her uni has effectively cancelled all in person classes and she has been self quarantining for several days, almost a week -- just out of her own choice. She has shown zero symptoms of being sick. After her university announced this change, we talked about the possibility of her flying here to stay with me while her school undergoes this change. Last week's early announcement of the travel ban obviously put off plans to look for flights. Today, however, I was reading this article ([https://globalnews.ca/news/6708564/non-essential-canada-us-travel-explained/?fbclid=IwAR2j7ApoMKm7QyFmEPJAKtRqQwqhFv98KLzo9-jjytSNTiFvzLyJ1zCFWVU](https:/…)) and noticed that it said this only effects land ports of entry. She has a problematic home life and cannot stay with her family, and her university apartment has some irresponsible roommates who are not obeying the suggested social distancing. She has remained mostly isolated. I realize this is not suggested by the US and Canada, but hypothetically, if we purchased a flight for her, would she be stopped at her destination port of entry, or even with US customs inside the YYZ airport (for example)? Any help would be appreciated. I apologize for this question as I know most everyone here is responsible and we are all trying to practice social distancing, but considering her circumstances, we were hoping to get through this together. Thanks for any and all help."
"What nationality is your girlfriend? I am assuming Canadian from the thread's subject. You don't mention it again.If she is Canadian you need an official answer - try the embassy? You don't want her flying to be stopped on entry based on our say so. You need a real answer.Edited: 8:17 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"""You don't want her flying to be stopped on entry based on our say so""Flying from Canada to the US you clear US Immigration in Canada - so she wouldn't be flying anywhere. Her journey would end at US pre-clearance at YYZ."
"So even if we purchased the ticket, she would likely be denied entry at US pre clearance because it’s non essential travel? This is what I expected, but I just hadn’t seen it reported anywhere.Also, to answer someone else — she is Canadian"
Here's the information from the Canadian government:https:/…united-statesThey're pretty clear than non-essential travel is not allowed.
Yes she will not be allowed to enter the US. She will be stopped at the US preclearance at the airport.
"Thank you for your reply.According to the CDC website (https:/…from-other-countries.html), entry will only not be permitted by foreign nationals who have visited the countries listed there, and Canada seems exempt.Is it up to the discretion of the US pre-clearance agent? Or is there an official source confirming that Canadians won’t be allowed?I appreciate your help, and everyone’s thus far"
"No, all non-essential travel cross the US-Can border is now banned. That applies to both US and Canadian travellers."

"Commercial trucking is considered essential travel. If you are really desperate, maybe she could hitch a ride with a Canadian beer truck or the like heading south. If she is wearing a Molson cap and shirt, she probably wouldn’t be stopped at the border."
My understanding is the restriction on non-essential border crossing pertains to the land border crossings. Assuming you can find a flight I think she'd be allowed to travel here subject to the US pre-clearance immigration agent in Toronto.
"Or she could just jog over the border, although I wouldn't recommend that:https:/…index.htmlSeriously though, I'm afraid the time has passed for your girlfriend to make the journey. I feel for her given what you've said about her situation, but hopefully you can keep contact via Skype or Facetime for the meanwhile."
"#11 - it certainly isn't 100% clear. This is the media release from the Canadian government:https:/…pm-covid19-eng.htmlPerhaps for the OP's girlfriend, she could just turn up and the airport and try to buy a ticket. That might offer the answer."
"The page you referenced, as of now (March 22), was last updated March 18, 2020. The non-essential travel ban between Canada and the USA became into effect March 21.https:/…united-states"
"My understanding is the restriction on non-essential border crossing pertains to the land border crossings---------Does not matter mode of entry or location of entry. Non-essential travelers will be turned back.Additionally, any Canadian would be foolish to to to USA. No health insurer in Canada offers out of country health insurance that will cover COVID issues. Further, the Canadian government has advised ""no out of country travel at all"" should be undertaken.No offence but a University grad student should know what the proper thing to do is, and that is to stay put in Canada.Edited: 9:44 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Commercial trucking is considered essential travel. If you are really desperate, maybe she could hitch a ride with a Canadian beer truck or the like heading south. If she is wearing a Molson cap and shirt, she probably wouldn’t be stopped at the border.What an idiotic response to this situation."
"The comment about health care is a really valid one. Combine that with the idea that, even if she is not symptomatic, the reason that travel is being restricted right now is to slow down the spread so that the health care authorities do not get overwhelmed in yet more places.My advice would be for her not to try illegal or semi-legal methods, because it's the right thing to do."
"Hi David,Just wondering if your GF ended up trying to fly to the US? I have the same question as all of the statements specify ""LAND"" border and US CBP's statement specifically states the border closure ""does not apply to air"". Thanks!"
"It seems that many flights from Toronto headed to the US have been suspended or cancelled. The border - whether on land or by air - is closed to non-essential travel. If the border opens after May 22, she might have some opportunity. Have you considered whether she can get to Buffalo NY and fly from there?"
The border is closed can’t get from Canada to Buffalo
