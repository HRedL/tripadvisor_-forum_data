Hello! Heading up to big sur first week in August and staying in carmel by the sea. Plan to drive down coast and would love to stay a little further south a cute coastal town with restaurants and something where I can stay with a nice view. Any ideas? Thank you!!
"Cambria or Avila BeachDo note that dine in is currently not allowed. Some restaurants have outdoor seating. Some are offering ""to go"" only."
"Yes thanks. I live in San Diego and we are outside dining only. I wouldn't dine inside even if it is allowed right now. :). Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it!!"
I did have a trip planned for Avila but decided to cancel. In my research all the restaurants I looked at were take out only.
Castle Inn Cambria or Shoreline Inn Cayucos
"From what I have read and heard there are too many people from heavily populated areas of SoCal and NorCal heading to the central coast small towns (as well as other rural parts were of CA). And causing their virus infections to increase. Frankly, I would not travel this August for the sake of public health."
"San Diego has so many attractions, why add to the possible spread of virus elsewhere or be exposed to those risks?Stay home. Enjoy home."
"The Central Coast is being swarmed by visitors, especially on the weekends. I wouldn't go near the coast on a weekend. Most of the visitors have also not heard of masks or social distancing."
I would say maybe one of the hotels along Moonstone beach in Cambria. There are also some hotels along the beach in Pismo. Think I would choose one of them as there are more eateries in those towns then Avila or San Simeon.
"Yes, 3chichuahua, they are absolute pigs. It's just awful. Do they act like this at home I wonder??"
"“And they're pigs. I've been seeing photos from Cayucos after weekends - there is trash left everywhere ~ on the street, the beach...food & drink containers, diapers, beer cans, masks and human crap. It's sickening.”I drove 20 minutes out of my way to a “quiet” beach today. I forgot it was Friday. Not quiet. Sometimes we’re Northern California, sometimes we’re the Central Coast but this summer we are always crowded ! I saw that diaper today along with the leftovers from some family’s lunch. Luckily I had gloves in car and could clean it before it washed out to the ocean. Of course it could be a local but it’s so ingrained in everyone around here to not litter I doubt it. Plus not ever visitor is like that. Most are wonderful. The bad apples always stand out. Remember “ Pack Your Trash”!"
"""Remember: """"Pack your trash""""Better yet: STAY HOME!!!Edited: 7:34 pm, July 24, 2020 "
Fortunately I hike where we see maybe 2-3 groups over 3-4 hours. Starting within 30 minutes of SF. But you have to be willing to do 7+ miles and the equivalent of 15+ flights. That’s the solution.
"Madeline the beach I went to on today in July at 1ish would have normally seen maybe ten people on a 3 miles walk. I saw about 50. It wasn’t packed like Huntington Beach packed at all but so be beyond normal. Our local politicians are basically closing everything, small stores, restaurants, salons, etc but leaving our beaches open. So our community can go bankrupt but San Jose can have a beach picnic. But all the restrooms are closing again so they better work on their Kegels.Edited: 11:01 pm, July 24, 2020 "
Santa Barbara.Pismo Beach
"If have to come up can you want until late August or after Labor Day when the kids are in school in one form or another? Everything is getting ready for a 3 week shut down of more services and there will be less crowds, better prices and better weather."
"SC I have been wondering about the bathroom situation for people taking road trips. Municipal rest rooms are closed in many places, Starbucks bathrooms are closed, stores like groceries & Targets have signs up saying that restrooms are temporarily closed? I can see why somebody mentioned poop in the street."
"Tom yes when we were on full shut down it was a problem. Now most restaurants are takeout only or have a patio. If they have a patio it’s for customers. The State Beaches just opened one upper lot so they opened one bathroom since you have to pay to park there. Ugh those bathrooms are disgusting. Most places like cvs and RiteAid won’t let people use their bathrooms anymore. It’s much worse Big Sur Village south and has been for years. I’ve mentioned this before but Memorial Day weekend my friend came home to family showering off in her carport for the ride back to the valley mom and dad were still in bathing suits. Thank goodness but not the kids. They asked her “ what are we supposed to do with the showers closed?”. Gee idk, maybe don’t come because that’s a hint that you shouldn’t or sit in your sand for two hours. There is no end to the weird stuff people think is perfectly normal.Edited: 3:08 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Thanks to those who provided actual feedback. Just a couple thoughts: not all tourists are pigs. Yes traveling isn't essential right now - but taking a drivable getaway following safe protocols with masks, sanitizer, and social distancing is good for mental health and also supports businesses in your area that need it right now. Thanks!!"
"Newsflash JaimeWe all want to travel for some fresh air .All your 2 k trip does is spread the wealth of Covid-19. And shut down business. We who are analytical and read know this.But keep on being you.Edited: 10:23 am, July 26, 2020 "
"I'm actually getting tested today - if I happen to be positive, my trip will be canceled. So no, I will not be spreading covid."
"And even if you test negative, what guarantees do you have about folks you come into contact with?And what if you or anybody in your party become infected far from home? Do you have the resources to quarantine far from home?"
"Let's say you came into contact with a Covid-19 carrier unknowingly after they touched a surface and it adheres to you. You touch it. Your immune system can fight the disease, however where you touched, someone whos immune system that's been on overdrive to not become infected now is too weak because of one asymptomatic carrier.It takes 2 weeks for symptoms to appear..See why we still have increases of Covid-19.Lucky you if you're just a carrier"
"We decided to camp over by June Lake, then drive over and stay in Carmel by the Sea, stopping in Avila on the way back south. Thanks for the advice!"
"This. This is the reason I feel more at risk now than I did in mid-May. Well, at least wear a mask. And, don’t be too surprised if you don’t get a warm welcome. Small towns are bearing the brunt of your stupidity."
"My niece was admitted into the hospital late last night with COVID pneumonia. She's also fighting Lymphoma. Her family is scared for her.How do she get it? A co-worker of her brother's went to a casino, caught the virus and brought it to work with her before symptoms hit and he, in turn, took it home with him. Now everyone in my sister's home is sick!!This is WHY people should stay close to home and avoid traveling and partying with family and friends.Stuff gets real when it hits close to home and heart.Please think about the impact your moving around might have on others."
"An irony is the apparently large number of non-local folks clamoring to get to San Diego, where we happen to be staying at home. Lots of places to see safely for San Diego residents. So why go elsewhere? The grass is pretty green here, with many more resources at home should one get infected."
"Sorry to hear that Kibbles. How did she know she got sick from her casino visit, are they doing contact tracing in SB county now? Fingers crossed for that whole family, what a nightmare. Folks who are opposed to covid-era-travel may want to make your voice heard by contacting the SLO Chamber of Commerce/Visitors Bureau. They are inundating facebook and latimes.com with ads encouraging traveling to the Central Coast."
"'We decided to camp over by June Lake, then drive over and stay in Carmel by the Sea, stopping in Avila on the way back south. Thanks for the advice!""Oh that is wonderful! I hope you experience everything possible in June Lake, Carmel, and Avila. You really deserve it seeing how you have been so deprived for these long months. Your sacrifice has not gone unnoticed.Edited: 2:53 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"TomMy niece lives in Kern County where COVID numbers are really high.I don't know all the details about my nephew's co-worker, but you'd think someone who worked in a senior care facility would have more sense than putting themselves into a very public setting during a pandemic."
"If you get tested today, will your results be back before your trip the first week in August? Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are stating that results are taking two weeks to come back. If you do get your result in time, and it is negative, that means that at the time you took the test you happened to be negative. The possibility is very real that you could contract the virus in the days right after taking the test, depending on who you come in contact with, as others have said."

"Jziol, thank you for trying to explain something that should be self evident."
"Shutdown should beNo one comes in.No one goes outside of a county.Groceries kiddos. Laundromat if you don't have W&D.I believe other countries the Government brought food to its citizens. Any state or National Park and beach close it.You think this is hard? Yeah it's hard having Government pay you to stay at home while the geniuses took a much deserved break.They're supposed to Serve the Public! during a pandemic for gawd sake.The LA Times said about 400+ LAPD officers had Covid19 cases with approximately 275 recovered . Around that.Do you know what this means¿?A valid reason why they don't want to enforce mask. Too bad that's what the big bucks all this time were for..Just bring the National Guards to the Nanny state please.Edited: 5:30 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"This is a travel forum - not a shaming site. Instead of insulting my intelligence and saying I'm entitled - why don't you nicely make suggestions. Covid sure is making some of you low class people mean.Edited: 6:39 pm, July 26, 2020 "
So you shame people by calling them low class.
"I wouldn't blame people who are traveling now for the spread. Blame the mayors and the governors and the public health advisors. In May when places like Los Angeles and San Francisco still had everyone staying-at-home, full flights were flying into the city from Chicago, New York, Massachusetts. Some were people coming back home from being stranded in hotspots, some were people coming to work, some were just idiots taking advantage of $89 flights. There was no screening on arrival, no tracking, not even a recommendation to be tested. It has been a real shitshow and many people can't even keep up with the current guidelines anymore. They don't even watch local tv news, they just have Hulu and Netflix. . And we've long been a culture of ""the rules are for other people"". I imagine that lots of people who are doing the ""shaming"" have also broken some rules lately. ""No gathering with family members who are not living in the same household""? ""Maintain 6 feet of distance in the supermarket""? ""Don't reuse your mask?"""
You must have been looking in the mirror when you made that low class remark. Karen.
"From now on when I hear the news say it's OUR fault now that Covid19 is rampant in California I'll think of classy San Diego Jaime.Of course I have the manpower to make sure everything works out. With one day it's this the next it's that. Which is all way behind what's really happening in real time.Just read North Kore announced a National Emergency Crisis withONE case.Edited: 7:29 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"I think many regulars are getting tired of a certain poster retelling about finger pointing, shaming etc. and another talking politics and big ""gubment"".Edited: 7:40 pm, July 26, 2020 "
Low class people? Who sits in middle seat in economy?
"Low class people chose to spread Covid around California. I had two trips that required flying to other states with my low class points that I canceled. I had hoped California was smart enough that we could take a low class in state vacation instead . Nope canceled it all. Some Californians couldn’t Walt 15 minutes for that extra marshmallow, and if you don’t know what that means: google, so we are buying a low class hot tub instead. Unfortunately since we have low class trade policies it will take months to build said low class hot tub because the supply chain is screwed up. You want help? Spend a weekend in your own county. Go to Temecula or Ocean Beach. If you must get away Californians have zero excuses to drive 6 hours to be entertained. Our friend’s businesses are shutting down yet again and you want a suggestion on where to “ tear it up” on the Central Coast?! Besides there is no such thing to be had right now in this area. Don’t bring San Diego into the Central Coast please."

"scincalifornia- I'm a fellow Aptosian, totally agree. I haven't been to the beach in months. Thanks goodness I have a home in the redwoods to hide in!"
"An update to this thread, we have decided to cancel our trip and stay in San Diego. This is a much more enjoyable site when all (including me) play nice, so I appreciate the travel feedback and hope everyone stays safe and well."
"An excellent decision. We who are in San Diego are relatively fortunate in having a greater range of possible local destinations. Obviously, not as great as in normal times, but as I remarked before, the grass is pretty green in SD even with the spectre of the virus."
"Kazmir, yes nothing like being a shut in while the rest of the world loves your town to death. I can’t wait until Labor Day. More businesses close tomorrow but the state in all its wisdom opens Seacliff to campers. I don’t get it."
"Thank you for your wise decision.Travel to other parts of our fabulous State will be so much more enjoyable when we can go to attractions restauran ts, interact with people, and do the things that we once took for granted.When this ia over I hope we won't lose sight of what we went though and we can reflect how blessed we are to once again enjoy the freedoms that we had to temporarily put on hold."
"Great decision.Just wanted to say that all lf the Eastern Sierra counties had no CoVid until we reopened a little and people started traveling. People in Inyo and Mono Counties are very seriously unhappy about this and are doing all they can to keep visitors out. They lobbied to get all campgrounds closed (I believe they were successful). Their medical services are not the best and the hotels/motels are struggling to stay open and to stay sanitized. We wanted to go up there too, as we do every year, but after reading local reports and news, realized just what an imposition that would be (at the time, my own county was decided not a hotspot - but once CoVid gets going, we all know how bad it gets).Dreaming about travel is fun - doing it right now, a very bad idea."
Looking back They opened ALOT.I'd rather be in another country facing this. Somewhere competent and safe. Had we known this..was coming ugh
"JaimieSmith324, I join those who thank you for your decision to stay within your area for now. My little town on the central coast had only 5 cases for the longest time But since July 4th and so many visitors here (lots from hot spots elsewhere in the State) we're at 23. The county numbers keep rising. https:/…positive-case-details.aspx I did a drive by along a stretch of beach this morning that has motels lining the other side of the street and a narrow boardwalk along the bluffs that's popular with tourists and locals alike. Out of about 40 people, I saw two wearing masks. Most of the locals I know who walk it have avoided it because of that. Not to say you would have been one of them, but even to be among others who could have COVID, it doesn't care where you're from. Enjoy what you have where you live and here's hoping you'll be able to get up to this area sometime next year."
"Wanderluster , I saw those numbers jump in Cambria. I was really shocked. We go there 3 or 4 times a year and I’m really missing it. Of course this week we get sent an Escape package from the lodge that I have to pass up, it sure was hard to.Did Cambria still have their fireworks display? Our numbers went from 180 to over 1,000 since the 4th for Santa Cruz County. The 4th really didn’t do the coastal towns any favors.Edited: 4:56 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Hi scincalifornia. Yeah, just so happened that on the 4th weekend, there was a heat wave in the central valley so there were lots of people who came from there since our beaches remained open while others in CA were closed. Personally, I wish they'd closed all the beaches to discourage such travel, but it is what it is, and now we're all paying a price for it. The fireworks show was cancelled in Cambria and in Cayucos. Pinederado (Labor Day weekend Lions Club fundraiser and parade) has also been cancelled. I feel for all the nonprofits suffering through not being able to hold their annual fund raisers.Maybe the powers that be will take heed of the seemingly necessary national ""reset"" being recommended by the medical experts where it's tough for all for another month or two, but maybe that kind of consistency and control is what it will take to rid of us this lingering, seemingly endless, situation."

"Wanderluster, same with Santa Cruz County. Monterey closed their beaches so it probably upped our visitors by at least 30% and we were already full. Hotels were literally hiring anyone they could get to clean rooms. They had ads on Nextdoor for $ 500 a condo or $500 a day at hotels . People with minimal training on proper cleaning. Our beaches were closed from 11 to 5 early on and it was helping. It gave locals time to still get walks in but discouraged out-of-towners from coming, until about mid June and then they just didn’t care about our ordinance and came anyway. Our county just gave up enforcement and stupidly opened right before the 4th. 180 to over a 1,000 in 3 weeks. No on will convince that tourists have nothing to do with that surge.Oh my daughter’s fiancé was part of the organization that put in the lighthouse glass on Main Street. The Lions maybe?Edited: 9:08 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Yep, you guys in Santa Cruz County are in the same situation. nextdestination, don't know if you can blame all this on just government decisions. A lot has to do with individuals taking the responsibility. No point to ordinances, signs etc if people think it doesn't apply to them.Here's some background on the Piedras Blancas fresnel lens on display Cambria's Main Street:https:/…fresnel-lens-cambria.html"
Thanks for the link on the Piedras Blancas lighthouse lens. I left out it’s my daughters fiancé’s grandfather that was part of the installation! As interesting as it is he’s 29 so not in his wheelhouse : )
WanderThere's approx 18 million people down here. That doesn't include the inlanders. It is impossible to social distance here with that many people. If there was a time government should use a heavy hand was right from the beginning. The flame has been lit and will keep burning. SARS-COV-2 is airborne too. To think this toxin is at our Beaches & National Parks like a wild fire. Humans should be no where near it. This is a worldwide Pandemic. The US should have taken examples from others who already we're hit hard.Had the State mandated laws they'd be making revenue. A steep fine should make most alert of the severity of a mask. But nooo we have a flake for a Governor that vacillates all over the place that I can't even listen to him anymore. That only with Bush before. I can't stand incompetency. Anyway it looks like a 3rd world in LA. But it's easy to see why.Stay safe and enjoy your sanctuary.I can't believe they'd accommodate prisoners during a pandemic over the homeless down here. Lawbreakers are rewarded over and over in California.
