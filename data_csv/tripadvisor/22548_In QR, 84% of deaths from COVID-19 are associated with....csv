"Source (translation from Spanish): https://translate.google.com/translate…In Quintana Roo, 84% of deaths from COVID-19 are associated with diabetes , 74% of fatalities had hypertension and 47%, obesity , state health secretary Alejandra revealed in a video this afternoon Aguirre Crespo.Through social networks, the head of the Ministry of Health of Quintana Roo (SESA), detailing why the entity faces ""two epidemics"" at this time , explained that the virus thrives easily when there are high levels of glucose in blood, which is why obese and overweight people rank first in deaths from COVID-19.""According to the most recent national health and nutrition survey, Q. Roo is the second entity with the highest percentage of people with obesity 8 out of 10 deaths are caused by diseases related to obesity and overweight,"" said the official.He added that every year 2.8 million people die in the world from causes related to obesity , this panorama has worsened with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease COVID-19, which caused the death of 146 thousand people in everyone during the first three months of involvement.After explaining the way in which the disease caused by this new coronavirus affects the population with chronic diseases, he invited the community to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which includes a good diet, in order to prevent medical complications.""Throughout the recent history of humanity, a situation of such great challenge as we are facing today has not been documented,"" he warned.Edited: 8:07 pm, April 23, 2020 "
That seems to be a very common trend. Hypertension diabetes and Obesity are really contributing To the death rate from what I’m reading in healthcare industry publications. I’ve been using this as motivation to quit comfort eating during my shelter at home :)
"I actually know 4 people who had Covid.1 person had 3 comorbidities and was very very sick. One family member had ZERO underlying conditions and was running 101 to 105 fever for 2 weeks. Not sure if this post is trying to minimize COVID and wants to say it’s ok to jump on an airplane but I won’t for a few months at best. I don’t think our economies need to come to a halt but distancing, mask wearing and avoiding an airplane is best for a few months until we get a handle on this. I for one don’t want to spend my vacation in my hotel room or hospital in Cancun. Why spend few thousand dollars to even risk it."
I have recently read an article about these three things being a concern as well in other areas of the world. Statistics do show they are of serious concern but as partygirl40 mentions there are many many people that have died and have been very sick with no prior health issues.
"SeeSea99, fellow Haligonian here!Yes, I read an article that can affect your kidneys and heart as well."
I don’t think this post is trying to minimize Covid 19. I think it is pointing out that the risk is much higher for those of us with other health conditions. But that’s true of any illness. If you have the flu and you have underlying health conditions it can be much more difficult. I thought it was just more information then minimization. I think some people are trying to read motives into things that don’t exist
"I don't think this article is trying to minimize the issue, just trying to put it into perspective. The reality is that there have not been many people dying without underlying conditions. There is absolutely zero data to support that concept. While it is sad that Partygirl has lost people she knows, it doesn't change the data. There are people at risk and they should be protected, but that doesn't mean that someone in good health should be afraid."
Hi ilovetotravel1977 from here in Halifax!!! Stressful and sad times indeed everywhere and even more so now here in Nova Scotia. Stay well and stay safe!!!
"The certainty and hubris with which the pseudo-experts here continue to push a specific agenda while the understanding of the medical experts on this virus continues to emerge as they see more cases over time is astounding.https:/…Edited: 10:10 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Reviewer, The facts are the facts. Sorry your fears are not supported by the data. There is the possibility the data is flawed, but it seems the more data is compiled, the more it looks like an over reaction."
"Excellent baseless post, including any knowledge on your part about my feelings...except probably the ones for your ridiculous posts.Edited: 9:26 am, April 26, 2020 "
"1. A new study of thousands of hospitalized coronavirus patients in the New York City area, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has found that nearly all of them had at least one major chronic health condition, and most — 88 percent — had at least two.Though earlier research has shown chronic conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are common risk factors for severe Covid-19, the ubiquity of serious medical conditions in these patients was striking: Only 6 percent of them had no underlying health conditions.Source: https:/…coronavirus-patients-risk.html2.

The following site shows a distinct correlation of lethality with increasing age and major underlying medical conditions:https:/…4. The article below discusses one approach to what I called a risk-based strategy:Dr. David L. Katz, in an op-ed in the New York Times on March 20 just as the number of deaths began to ramp up, proposed a plan that he called, “vertical risk based interdiction.” The idea was that resources should be targeted to vulnerable populations, including the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions, while allowing healthier populations to continue more “normal” lives.Source: https:/…"
"this is ridiculous. People, oh say my husband, are in good health. He is t1 diabetic, but that does NOT mean he is NOT in good health. He is. So 84% are associated with diabetes? Why? We have a home in Cozumel, but it is unlikely we can get there for at least 1.5 years now. Because he is diabetic. He isn't gonna be a guinea pig to travel when he can live decades MORE with diabetes, but NOT with COVID. It'd be cool if this announcement understood that people with comorbidities can be perfectly healthy regardless of having these issues. At least, regardless of being T1 diabetic. All that means is your pancreas doesn't work. With healthy diet and minimal use of insulin, you can maintain an A1C that places you in a non diabetic level. We've been doing that diet since he was diagnosed 5 years ago. ALSO, IMO that does not mean you should have to die (no matter what comorbidities you may have, the camp saying you should die so the economy can open up is disgusting) so ya, no air travel, no socializing at all really. NOT before treatment is readily available. AND someone can figure out how to apply said treatment to those with T1 diabetes, immuno challenged people, etc. Not hopeful this will come from anywhere in the US, but am hopeful it will happen. Also, there've been plenty of people dying with NO underlying conditions at all. Including strokes in perfectly healthy 30 to 40 year olds. For now, we stay here and wait until we can safely go to our home in Cozumel. That isn't anywhere close to happening."
"Of course it’s ridiculous. Approximately half of Americans have a chronic disease:https:/…AboutChronicDisease.pdfI didn’t bother reading the NYT op-Ed from 6 weeks ago because 6 weeks is ages ago in terms of the evolution of this crisis and I don’t doubt that poster also would have quoted it out of context to support his unchanging, fringe views."
"From copil.’s op Ed: “ We have, to date, fewer than 200 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States — a small data set from which to draw big conclusions.“6 weeks later, we have 64 thousand dead in the USA. Indeed...it was a small data set. The data are still emerging so models and mindsets need to be flexible and change as needed. Everyone wants to open back up as safely as possible, informed by science."
"""The idea was that resources should be targeted to vulnerable populations, including the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions, while allowing healthier populations to continue more “normal” lives.""This is also a naive understanding of how people live in most countries. What are multigenerational households or households where the grandparents are the caregivers for the young and school age kids while the parents work to do? Where are the children of those with health conditions supposed to live while they attend school, but their parents remain isolated? How is a spouse, roommate, or domestic partner with no underlying health condition supposed to go about ""normal life"" while living with someone vulnerable. The idea that it's possible to target resources and protect one (large) portion of any population, as this member keeps claiming, while allowing the rest of folks to go about their lives is based on a seeming lack of understanding of how the populous interacts and contagion. Resources need to go the way public health experts recommend: PPE for those who interact with the public, needed medical equipment, mass testing, antibody testing, contact tracing, possible treatments, food for those in need, and vaccines.Edited: 10:41 am, May 01, 2020 "
"Winco, it’s very possible to be healthy with an underlying condition. The point we are all making is Type 1 diabetes no matter what angle you look at it it is still an underlying condition. I am diabetic type 2, not overweight, no high blood pressure, everything is perfect except for the diabetes and being 50 years old now. Not enough is known about Corona for me to feel sure I would be ok. I for one wouldn’t want to get sick with this in Mexico even with the best insurance plan I can buy. We will know more in the months to come. I sure wish you and your husband good health! I tested negative for the antibodies but it actually made me be even more paranoid. I finally ditched my mask yesterday."
