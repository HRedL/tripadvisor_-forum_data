"Hi all, has the virus had any impact on numbers of people visiting Nerja are the bars and restaurants quieter than usual or is it business as normal.Due to travel next week hoping it will not be like a Ghost town ."
"business as usual, no impact so far on restaurants, cafes & bars."
"Hi Pollytours, I was beginning to feel sorry for poor ole Nerja not having any virus posts ;-)Everything appears on the surface as normal. The only thing I've noticed was this afternoon at Mercadona - it seems that the panic buying has just begun as they had no fresh chicken, no fresh beef, no toilet rolls nor hand wipes & no liquid soap. An old Spanish guy in front of me at the check out had a trolley full of large packs of rice, pasta, tomato paste stuff & 6 big bags of frozen chicken. So if you are self catering be aware?"
"The administrators for my apartment block have just emailed to say they are closing their office and will delay any AGM. I'm over in 3 weeks, hope it will all have calmed down by then."
"Hello KevAccording to the health experts, they say that the peak will be around May time based on projections etc, not sure how accurate it is but a lot of what they said made perfect sense, so there's a long way to go yet I fear."
"Town is normal interms of the amount of people around. But good luck getting any alcohol gel in mercadona!empty shelfsMost cases are up in madrid etc. A few in the south but nothing majorEdited: 3:55 pm, March 12, 2020 "
".Andalucia is the fifth most affected region overall nationally, but within Andalucia, I believe that the province of Malaga has about 2/3rds of the cases, the other 7 provinces having one third between them all.Schools, colleges and universities are being closed, fiestas, carnivals and weekly markets are being suspended, as well as football matches.It is bleak.."
"Schools are now closed for at least 14 days, senior centres are closed, sports events and social events for seniors are banned...that I believe is it so far in Nerja."
"Thanks to all for the updates so pleased to hear currently Nerja is still thriving.Violette thanks for the tip on the Supermarkets always bring basics eg Coffee,cereal etc with me will probably add a few more bits in my luggage but food shopping is the least of my worries as long as I can get a good G & T and a nice meal I am a happy woman ."
"Pollytours, as it stands at the moment you won't have any problem getting a nice meal & a G & T;-) The weather is glorious but like the virus nobody knows what next week holds. If you are self catering I would maybe consider a few extra items perhaps?"
"I would postpone any trip to Spain until the coronavirus crisis is over.As of this day, 3000 people have been infected, with 84 deaths."
"Out of 46 Million, that;s 0.006 % #perspectiveIt seems like business as usual in Nerja at the moment, maybe wait until after the weekend to decide as it's still a very fluid situation.Edited: 5:31 am, March 13, 2020 "
Frigiliana is business as usual - the kids are still going to school. it may change i suppose. I’m still glad i came. I’m from London so just as likely to catch it there.
"Everything is as usuel here in Nerja, but I have seen that busdrivers use gloves!"
"A state of emergency had been called for the next 2 weeks. Deaths around 150 and 4,300 have it. Wonder what the flue death rate was at this time last year to compair"
"Yes same here, was wondering the same that’s if it’s not a no go zone"
Yesterday I was 100% sure about making the trip but today another dramatic increase in Spain albeit Malaga Province in not on the “danger” list of areas.What concerns me more as the days go by Spain may introduce a quarantine period for arriving visitors so what would be the point I am a realist and can see this being a strong possibility.So now I am only 50/50 about making the trip.
Hello I’m writing this response whilst I’m staying in Nerja. The weather remains to be very warm and sunny round about 23°. There are less people about my advice would be to contact the hotel you’re staying in or whoever you’re renting from also keep in mind government advice.The supermarket and her having the usual panic buying but there is still toilet rolls to be had! This
"Uk goverment only says to avoid the areas with high counts of the virus. Ie around madrid and some northern areas. No point cancelling anything unless its taken out of your hands ie goverment warnings/shut downs. You have prob got far more chance catching it in the uk in such a crowded overpopulated countryEdited: 3:36 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Winchmore is correct, if you check the FCO advice, it's only certain areas of Spain at the moment. What might be of concern to some people, either ex pat residents or frequent visitors is that if they don't have a good grasp of the language and do run into difficulties, with the panic and potential overwhelming influx of patients the last thing you want to be doing is flicking through a phrase book :(Edited: 3:58 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"A bit dramatic GS2017. And where the heck is winchmoren on this thread?All is currently normal in Nerja apart from a bit of panic buying, but as I said yesterday the smaller shops are keeping up pretty well:-)"
"Valencia region which includes benidorm, Ibiza, Alicante, Murcia has shut all bars, restaurants etc from. Midnight for 15 days. Madrid was first and other regions will follow soon"
"Chris and Jacki, you may well be right there! ;-("
"I was looking on another site earlier & someone claimed that bars & restaurants in Nerja & Torrox had been asked to close. Obviously this may happen at some stage but for now is fake news. So before it is posted here.....Potters bar has ""chosen"" to close & that is their choice. Nothing has been imposed as yet."
"International Club of Nerja closing for 2 weeks. Good decision as many of their clients are close to the ""at risk"" age range.Good call."
Lots of people from madrid etc running off to their holiday homes in murcia/valencia amd taking the virus with them!
Are there any people in Nerja with the virus that's been confirmed.
"Not as far as I know, but it's surely only a matter of time as people travel about through or via Malaga going East - then I would think the lockdown will happen as it's such a small tight place, it would spread so quickly :( Hopefully it can be contained though before that happens."
"Post 27, thankfully a post I can agree with! ;-)"
"We are still in Nerja--been here 8 weeks but leaving Monday. There has been a subtle change over the past 2-3 days. More spaces in evening (inside) restaurants, staff wearing latex gloves, some shops erecting 1m barrier at sales counters. Some people we have spoken to are returning early, concerned that flights may be cancelled. It won't be a ghost town but Spain is suffering. Keep safe."
"Hostal Dona Carmen is closing for a couple of weeks and I’ve just seen the second hand book shop on c/Granada is also closing. My family in Nerja tell me there is a lot of talk of bars and terraces closing. I expect the situation to develop over the weekend. Shame, I’m due over on Thursday. Worse, of course, for businesses there and those directly impacted."
Update - I’ve just been told that Ayo’s is closed for two weeks.
""" I expect the situation to develop over the weekend""PedaloGirl I agree! ;-( ."
"I'm not far away right now, in Malaga. Things have been very calm for the last couple of weeks. Then a day or so ago things started to change. Sites are closing down. We toured Caminita del Rey today and were told it was closing tomorrow. Old town is unusually quiet and we heard the restaurants will be closed tomorrow for the foreseeable future.We're supposed to fly out to Barcelona on Sunday and now that's in question too. We can't get our flights home moved up either. It's getting bad in a hurry."
Do not come. Spain going in lock down
"Went out for tapas tonight Asador de Castillo shut Gloria shut went to the round bar and as from tomorrow they are both shutting for 14 days all others are waiting to hear what the governent says,love Nerja."
"As Costa del Sol is a popular destination for Madrilenos and many have second homes, local authorities are alarmed at their influx following Madrid lockdown, fearing they will bring virus with them and spread it among locals. Some beaches have been closed in Torre del Mar and further steps to restrict movement are likely, and closure of places people gather such as restaurants, cafes and bars. This will affect foreign tourists already here and those coming soon."
Do not travel this weekend
"A consideration for all traveling to Spain.The flights may well be available now , but if a lock down occurs how do we get home?We have booked for a large family group X 14 to Nerja for two weeks at the beginning of May. Flights are booked as is car hire and accommodation. I believe in the UK the peak of the illness is expected in the next few weeks.I am hoping for more advice in the next week.The main priority is to try to keep the virus from spreading. I am praying for all the people affected now, by this virus."
"I think you should stay at home and follow the recommendations of your local authority to prevent the spread of this nasty virus.If you survive it, you'll get chance later to travel and enjoy life."
Nearest cases i believe are in almunecar. Two health workers.
.Plus 2 deaths just announced in Malaga Keep safe.
Do you still intend to go to Nerja ? We were due to go Wednesday.
"I have just read something on Facebook re Nerja closing chiringuitos, bars and public buildings to stop the spread of Coronavirus. Can't find the post now,it was on one of the Nerja pages.Edited: 5:29 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Some shops and bars had already taken the decision to close voluntarily. The Caves are closed, naturally, and the Council has now banned the use of local parks, gardens and the beaches."
I live here for winter and the bars and restaurants are quiet it’s seems like people are staying away from people. Most of the food from the supermarkets are selling out because of panic buyers. The media are scare mongering people
https:/… Just found it.There is also a post asking people not to panic buy.
The beaches in Nerja are being taped off now.
"I am due to come out 26th March, not sure what's going to happen now, with all the closures."
"The UK FCO will probably issue a ‘no travel’ advisory before then. Whatever you do, don’t cancel yourself as this invalidates any claim in your travel insurance."
"Nothing will change for the better until at least the 30th march as the state of emergency has been called until then.The fCO has given no non urgent travel warnings to the areas around mardrid and areas in the north where there have been many cases.You think the goverments would give older people the pneumonia vaccine to help prevent more deaths. $£€Edited: 6:22 am, March 14, 2020 "
Does anyone know why the beaches are being taped off?
"Post 52, because when Madrid closed down all the stioopid inhabitants got in the cars & came south....bringing the virus with them!Now they / all will not be allowed to gather in places such as the beach"
"Our party have decided to cancel our holiday to Nerja , due to take place at the end of April. I am just waiting for further government advice due to our insurance criteria.I think / hope the villa owner will be sympathetic ?We are hoping to bank the holiday until later in the year, when hopefully, everything is back to normal. I hope that many more take the decision not to travel to help in the fight of reducing the infection.Life is very precious. Keep Smiling!"
At least the people from Madrid aren’t stupid enough to fly to another country during a pandemic.
"Quite, Inspire26778. It's rather churlish to call others stupid when you've done a similar thing yourself. It's that age-old Spanish = 'stupid', me = 'clever' bigotry."
Usual attackers out in force!How sad they are....

Hi Lorrel 28Can you check the booking terms and conditions and see what they say regarding cancellations or check with your travel insurance? I hope you manage to either rebook or get your money back (or at least some of it) - it's all rather a big mess :( Let us know how you get on.
"I'm sorry, Violette-58 but if you are going to start hurling insults around about others while doing EXACTLY the same yourself then you are going to called out for hypocrisy. My tip: Don't call others 'stupid', it reflects very badly on oneself."
"karl4thewhites, I'm afraid it's a very fast-moving situation and so things are going to be happening at very short notice. It looks like Malaga Province is going to ask all bars and restaurants to close for 15 days so please be prepared for this outcome too.Stay safe."
"It's not surprising really, they're obviously trying to get ahead of it due to the spike in cases in Spain. This makes for interesting reading etchttps:/…Karl, I can imagine that things will get much worse there before they get better with regards to precautions etc, places closing, and potential self isolations imposed, Spain is the 2nd highest case rate in Europe behind Italy, albeit not concentrated in the Nerja area, but it can spread so very quickly, especially when some show now signs of infection until they've possibly infected a dozen more. The domino effect in these kinds of situations can have devastating effects."
"Ah, NMB has a bit more information, I didn't realise they were considering that level of closure so quickly - thanks for the update, it will be useful to others."
"Yesterday Sachez declared a state of emergency.Today Spain is waiting for the next speech @ 2.30 to find out exactly what will be imposed. It has been widely suggested that bars, restaurants & shops (except chemist, food shops, tabacs & petrol stations) will be told to close.It was all over the news yesterday."
Burriana beach and bars closed god knows why as zero cases in Nerja going upto balcon later in the hope it’s still open talk about over reaction
"Karl it’s important that you keep up with the news now. The concern is over spreading the virus, whether there are currently actually any known cases isn’t really relevant as all experience so far is that asymptomatic carriers can spread it for seven days before realising they may have it."
"Karl4, nobody can tell how the virus will travel especially with so many folk from Madrid heading south after being told to stay at home! Very inconsiderate!!"
"@karl post 67. It's not over reaction. The Spanish authorities are simply trying to control a fast moving situation with a potentially deadly virus in which we have no immunity and no vaccine. It's been made clear to me through family contacts how serious the situation is with this virus. Sadly, a significant number of people are going to die. Try and take the current situation more seriously than you appear to be taking at the moment."
Could you please update on that once you’ve been up to the Balcon.. we are wondering if our holiday next week will get cancelled?. It’s good to have eyes on the ground info.. thank you!
"ruth, you'll also need to check any updates with your Airline as they will ultimately decide whether you travel or not (presuming you are flying of course). If the others follow Jet2's stance then they will also cancel all flights to Spain possibly by the time you go. However, if they don't but then decide to cancel whilst you are there then you could end up being stranded or have difficulties in getting back."
"ruth c, the Balcon & environs are open.We will know more after 2.30pm."
Agree ~ we are due to visit next Sunday .. we are hoping the travel company will cancel our break and we can go another time .. hugely disappointing but think it will cause more problems but people if aren’t stopped from moving About and spreading ..
Is that still the case this weekend or has that changed now?..
"Burriana Beach and bars are closed today.Edited: 8:58 am, March 14, 2020 "
Just seen this - major impact to say the least:https:/…5e6cb1fefdddff13918b463f.html
Frigiliana is pretty quiet. Not many tourists walking about now although this morning the standard coach trippers arrived.restaurants in the plaza are open with a decent amount of people but some others are shut. Typical british immigrants still sat in the same bars drinking as they always do. So no change there!
I wouldnt canel any holiday if its a month or more from now. The virus is now dieing out in china so it will probably pass through in a similar fashion
"It’s flu! 30,000 people die every year from flu there is no panic about that each winter, if the elderly and those with underlying health issues are protected and areas with the virus can’t travel to clean areas like Nerja it should be contained. We are currently on the balcon with many other people the bars and restaurants are open, it seems it’s only the beaches and beach bars are closed so being in close proximity to many people on the balcon is not a risk but lying on a huge half empty beach is? You are entitled to your opinion as am I"
"Karl we have a flu vaccine to protect, as with most other diseases. Nerja is not a clean area as impossible to detect a carrier, Nerja weekly receives visitors from many areas, who maybe have infected many residents."
"Closing beaches is to incourage peole not to be congregating and going out. Its probably more a mental thing rather than really helping in a practical sense as at this time of year they are pretty quiet anyway.The whole country is expected to go into lockowwn like italy.just waiting on a statement from sanchez after the meeting which is happening now i believeEdited: 10:54 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Karl 4, you are correct that Nerja has, so far, no known cases. However the town wishes to maintain this situation, as Turismo Nerja explains here....https://www.facebook.com/TurismodeNerja/?__tn__=kCH-R&eid=ARD8yPC4n-dAOOOXqAKY6_pOO9ocC2uB8vdohJWKEqGC0OCKn2jYYjz5uHmSxFsmLVDyoiUcNN8CZV1L&hc_ref=ART45PprR1tPhU-MhH43P6Ia6zNkHh29XoEhjgWwAfL8-Xw-5bkrUz33dFeYaMLMva0&fref=nf&__xts__[0]=68.ARBCmTD5uKPOtfyHS1UmLYg4_8Kw4Cre6Lw9p9PouYzdAD7gB8vLAqLjUmCDlJlb1u3-FP4GEpSarr_dJOInXUBMbI98crPJaozXhVtqpOfbE_w2zabnpinpHOiXoKvCSSEGgJdO-rf_hYFx_O2IGMe8bGDEmOIMXEowjdxabfboiD2p1Obyvab_6vyS1Kq6u73mO_YK08lp6xac5RYDGUifCaegd7SSmHO47vdtZCG7iSo-GFedalwcwbH2TBUN6CXbYCm_KDs-hAOa3lqeuT3dI4fHrWq1hi9icG75Xn33n8k-b6DtN-5VctIRVrVSOOVhjWeOx7H2J05nUh3fGUhQlik70R8TusiIhp5Qoy2rJA1mOvKKigEEdit, sorry about that ridiculously long link!

"@karl post 80. What do you mean ""it's flu"". The Covid-19 virus isn't flu. It's a completely new strain of virus belonging to the coronavirus family of viruses which specifically attack the respiratory system. It has nothing to do with flu whatsoever. Currently there is no vaccine for Covid-19 and there is no recorded immunity within the human population since it is a new virus.For more information on coronavirus see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoronavirusEdited: 11:34 am, March 14, 2020 "
Karl it's a flu like illness but it's not flu and flu jabs and pneumonia jabs will offer no protection to the virus.
"The bars and restaurants are currently only still open due to a legal technicality. The Government has issued a draft decree closing everything except food shops, pharmacies and other essential services. It cannot come into full legal effect immediately as they first have to gain the constitutional powers to overrule the 17 Autonomous Regions.Many responsible bar and restaurant owners have already closed but of course there are always those who’ll wait until the absolute letter of the law is imposed to close.Nothing else will be open by Monday. If I were you I’d be getting up to Mercadona to get some shopping in rather than sitting in a bar - possibly next to an asymptomatic carrier.Edited: 11:54 am, March 14, 2020 "
From what I gather this all comes into effect at 8am on Monday.
"Post 86 ""If I were you I’d be getting up to Mercadona to get some shopping in rather than sitting in a bar - possibly next to an asymptomatic carrier""I very much doubt that at 5pm Mercadona will have much on their shelves...the panic buying started there days ago!!I suggest going to the smaller supermarkets as they seem to be keeping up stock levels much better."
I think you'll find a lot closed. Pubs/Cafés etc
The shutdown is still been debated by goverment. No offical word yet
Thewanding….I think Nerja council are taking it into their own hands - I understand that they are closing everything now.
"Excellent advice! I'm due to bring a party out on the same day. Neither UK Govt nor Ryanair have yet stated not to travel, which negates any travel insurance claim.What useful thread this is!"
"Mayor orders temporary closure of Nerja hospitality establishmentsIn view of the incomprehensible delay of the appearance of the President of the Government, to announce the measures arising from the statement of the State of Alarm, and in the evidence that part of the population is not responding to the preventive recommendations announced by the Junta de Andalusia, the Mayor of Nerja, José Alberto Armijo, has instructed the local police to proceed with the temporary closure of bars, cafes, restaurants and other hotel establishments.The Mayor welcomes Organic Law 3/1986 of 14 April 14 on Special Measures in Public Health, which provides for in article 1 that public administrations, within the scope of their competence, for the purpose to protect public health and prevent its loss or deterioration, they may take the measures provided for in that Act where they require health reasons of urgency or necessity, resulting in art. 21 m, which attributes the Mayor the competence to take personally, and under his responsibility, the necessary and appropriate measures, in the event of disaster or public misfortune or serious risk thereof."
"Nous avons des nouvelles de Nerja ! Tout est fermé... magasins, bars, restos, écoles ! Pas de voitures...Ville morte Confinement total !"
"thewonderingloiner, what a knob head, post 90"
"C'est une vraiment dommage , Laurance, mais absolument necessaire.Restez en sécurité"

"Wanderingloiner would be from Leeds i had assumed previously, and therefore take some of his comments as i assume he meant them, a little tongue in cheek, https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/wh…"
Don't let one persons views put you off.(Post 90) . Nerja is a beautiful place. We were due to fly out two weeks today for my birthday but doesn't look like it is going to happen. So disappointed. Hope to rebook for later in the year. I've always found people very friendly in Nerja and hope everyone stays safe and well during this difficult time.
All the bars and restaurants are closed it’s like a ghost town. All the schools are closed and beaches. Last night we drove down to Nerja and Torrox everything’s in darkness all closed. We are asked to not travel and I live here for winter. There are no cases of Coronavirus here so not sure why all’s closed.
"The 15 day lockdown came into law last night.hairdressers,dry cleaners chemists supermarkets tabacs can open. Trips to such places are allowed or going to and from work.otherwise people are required to stay off the streets"
"I must admit that I took WLs post as a joke.It had a smiley face AND a winky face!! Its very hard sometimes to get irony and light hearted banter over in a post? Re Coronavirus, are they testing people in Spain? Both my daughter and grandson have what is obviously the virus, but 111 told her that she wont be tested.She is a teacher and the school needs to know? How will we ever have a true picture?"
"The 15 day lockdown came into law last night.hairdressers,dry cleaners chemists supermarkets tabacs can open. Trips to such places are allowed or going to and from work.otherwise people are required to stay off the streetsIts for the whole country tracey. There have been cases in almunecar and those in madrid decided to go towards murcia and and into andalucia and no doubt have brought the virus with them.so this is preventative.abit after the horse has bolted but better than nothing.not great for the last winter stay before the brexit transition period ends but it is what it is.hopefully it will help to slow/stop the spread"
Not sure keeping the hairdressers open is a good idea - an asymptomatic hairdresser is going to be a superspreader - but the Señoras must have their hair done!
"@Sheila post 110 They need to self isolate for 7 days Your daughter needs to go online to the NHS advice She does not need to call 111 but use the online tool If she requires a sick note , not necessary if she only needs to stay off for 7 days as she can self cert then 111 service can provide , she does not need to go to the GP or call the GP Does that help/ answer the queries I do work in the NHS so feel confident in providing info . However things are fast changing and therefore using the online service is best"
The peluquerias are allowed to stay open so that those unable to wash their own hair - the elderly or disabled - can go and get it done for them. I'm sure they'll do you a quick perm while you're there though.
"Post #18 what about a Shampoo and set?Edited: 6:40 am, March 15, 2020 "
Yeah I find keeping hairdressers the tobaconist and dry cleaners open an odd one. I would imagine some other businesses might be aggrieved by this.
"The unwritten (but generally observed) rule about not using emojis on TA forums is a welcome thing, it does help those of us with optical issues greatly. Please continue to observe it, thanks."
What about dental practice? More so for emergency than basic work.

Gib is shut too.There will be some great hairdo`s if the hairdressers are observing the keep 1m apart rule lol.
"Post 127 sheilamary3, I'm sorry to hear that. If the NHS aren't wanting to hear from people with the virus how on earth can they gauge the number of cases?Stay safe & well."
"@Sheila Good news on your Grandson . Sure your daughter will be lots better soon . Not sure why 111 gave that message as , yes we expect protocols to change , however they have clear word patterns and pathways to follow which get updated . Should anyone start to feel Shortness of Breath and worsening they should call 111 not the GP , 111 will then arrange Care Wishing them all the best We can’t get over ourselves and pleased not confirmed flights . Will see what things look like in 2 months One thing for sure it’s going to be more difficult in the UK very soon"
"Edward sissorhands will come in handy at the hairdressers mantalk!So Gib has closed shops aswell? Wonder if they will shut the border or is ££ too important there.The uk doesnt want offical numbers as it thinks its in some sort of comp with the rest of europe and can pretend the problem isnt as bad there.the westminster goverment is obsessed with the economy and £££. The U.K is built on money and will leave it till the last minute to protect the economy rather than the public. In reality they just want to delay as much ad possible as the NHS cant handle a ""normal"" winter let alone mass illness. Hancock at last admits they dont have enough ventilators etc and will buy them off anyone!"
The streets of Nerja are being disinfected.Well done Nerja limpia!!!
Probably very strong stuff wanderingloiner. (hipoclorito)

"Hi there, as a resident here in Nerja, I am so sorry to say that as from Monday 16th March a total lock down has been ordered by the authorities for 15 days. That said, the police went around 2 days ago and closed down all the cafes, bars & restaurants etc."
"Posts 137 & 138, have you been living in bubbles? LOLIt was yesterday, not 2 days ago, that the bars & restaurants were closed down (approx. 5pm). Also the lockdown doesn't begin tomorrow (Monday) it has already begun!"
"To LDRML and Nick G - fortunately, even in the most dire of situations such as this, most other forums don't greet you in such a hostile and unfriendly manner.Thank you for your information.

Just travelled back from there today after a lovely week there. The entire town went on lockdown from yesterday. Beaches are closed and the police are on full force.
"Surprised at the amount of people and cars out in nerja today while on the way to the supermarket. No poilce checkpoints.saw very few police about. Very difficult to inforce on a weekdayEdited: 8:02 am, March 16, 2020 "
"I've just flicked through all the Spanish webcams on Skyline and Earthcam and it's like a zombie movie without the zombies. There are cars and vans moving... and buses, but streets and beaches are pretty much empty. It's a very eerie thing to see. I watched the seafront cam in Fuengirola for 5 minutes and only 2 pedestrians walked by."
"Sudaft, I think it's very difficult for people to understand lockdown unless you are actually part of it. People are not allowed out of their homes unless to visit the supermarket or walk the dog etc, and then it must be just one person.Tonight the land borders will be closed too!"
Seen many cars with 2 people in today.lots of people walking about not carrying shopping etc! very discriminatory to those who dont drive.they are expected not to leave their house for at least two weeks.they cant even do their own shopping? its Probably going to be three going by what members of the goverment say aswell.Saw someone with an almost full on style world war one type gas mask on today. Had to stop myself from laughing. Well i guess it offers more protection than abit of cotton over your mouth thats prob full of germs and as said by the experts will do nothing at all to stop you getting infected. We certainly are living in strange times.
"Just read in the Olive Press (sorry I haven't got the link) that up to 12,000 people could lose their jobs in the hotel sector in Spain. Thats devistating!"
I would think it will be a lot more than 12000 people
You're correct. That was the figure for the Costa Del Sol.
And all the bars and restaurants/shop.the goverment is meeting today to discuss plans to help workers and business.
"I hope they do Loiner. Same with all other countries including UK, otherwise there's going to be hardship and a huge knock on effect."
"All bars and restaurants, beaches, shops and sport facilities are closed, open are only pharmacies and food shops. People must stay at home but may go shopping, to the bank or doctor. It is a ghost town, but no panic is seen. It is said that the closing will be at least until 16 April."
"Thought lock down was (15days) until 29th March, then a review is to be made :-(( x"
Thats correct 15 days until the 30th at the mo. By law they cant do more than 15. But a minister said yesterday that theres a chance it could go on for another week or so. It all depends on whether theres any drop in the numbers.what effect the lockdown has the amount diagnosed etc
"Although it effectively started earlier, the 15-day period runs from 08:00 Monday 16th March, and almost certainly will be extended. The figures coming out of Italy after 8 days are not encouraging."
"https:/…The Government warns that the state of alarm will have to be extended beyond 15 daysThe closing of the country's borders becomes one of the following measures to adoptCoronavirus live, latest newsQuim Torra tests positive for coronavirusVictor Ruiz de AlmirónVíctor Ruiz de AlmirónFOLLOWMADRID Updated:03/16/2020 22: 02hSAVE188RELATED NEWSDefense will also have the Army as Military Police and to build military campsDoubts and gaps about the 15 days of confinementThe Government recognizes that the state of alarm will have to be extended beyond the initial 15 days allowed by law and that are contemplated in the Royal Decree.

But he anticipated more forceful initiatives: ""It is clear that if we do not take particularly harsh measures, slowing down the spread of the virus and the impact it is having on people's health and lives would have no effect.""In this idea of ​​taking tougher measures, the Interior Minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska , another of these four delegated authorities, has clearly pointed out what one of these new measures would be: ""It is a real possibility that Spain closes its borders to fight against the spread of the virus, ""he said in an interview on Cadena Ser.In another interview on Spanish Television, the government spokesperson, María Jesús Montero , preferred to be more cautious about prolonging the state of alarm and said that there is no need to make hypotheses."
"Thanks for the info mantalkEdited: 1:49 pm, March 18, 2020 "
You`re welcome (courtesy of Google translate too lol)
We just returned to Nerja on March 15 and it was a ghost town. Do not go if you want to be confined to your hotel room. Police are roaming the streets.
All spanish hotels are been closed next week. The land border is closed to non nationals/residents and theres very few flights.so i doubt anyone has any intrest in coming here unless you are trying to get home
"The Spanish government has confirmed it has NOT given an order to close hotels in Spain from Tuesday 24 March.The BOE decree states ""in a constant and progressive"" way hotels and all type of accomodation should ""limit their activity"".Spanish Government confirmed that ""hotels are no longer accepting reservations and will attend to guests until their departure, doing everything possible to keep an orderly situation, without ultimatums or sudden closures"""

Your post just came up in a search I did. I imagine you know by now the situation in Spain and have cancelled your holiday. Just wanted to say sorry and hope you'll come when this is all over. Cause we will get through it and Nerja will need you. Nerja is going to do it really tough with its reliance on tourism. So sad for such a beautiful town.
Lots of conflicting information around as you know. I'm reading that they have signalled their intention to publish a ministerial order in the next days to close by the 24th March giving businesses a weeks notice to do so. https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-… The UK travel advisory also said this when I looked earlier but now seems to have changed. Is the BOE you refer to from today ie dated 19/3? Not meaning to imply you're wrong. It's just so hard to keep up as things are constantly changing.
"apart from whether the details of the closure of hotels and campings is correct I just noticed that noone has actually told you the state of things here. Hotels are being commissioned in other parts of Spain for hospitalization of non serious cases. Govt can do so if they are needed in any zone. In all parts of Spain noone can leave their home/accommodation except to go to supermarket/food shops, pharmacy, medical/vet etc, ie only essential services. and can only go out alone. no couples unless one is disabled/cannot go out without help (there are some exceptions but tourists aren't among them), no groups no families. no going for a walk or run, nothing for recreation.no general shops bars or restaurants. can take dog out to pee but not to walk them far. (specific distance and time restrictions depend on the town). parks beaches and public spaces closed and patrolled by police and guardia. conditions dynamic and subject to change. apart from all that cases are growing at 25% and there are cases confirmed (I believe) in frigiliana, algarroba (1) and velez malaga. there are shortages of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. not the place for a holiday right now."
"Also just saw this on a group https:/…The FCO advises all British travellers in Spain to contact their tour operator or airline as soon as possible, to arrange their return journey before 24 March."
"There are no confirmed or possible cases been reported in frigiliana or nerja. The last updated info from 4 days ago was 13 in cases the axarquia. 7 in velez,5 in rincon and one in algarrobo. There was also a few in almunecar who were health workers. Touch wood the east of malaga is doing far better than malaga and the west with a lesser population."
"Hope it stays that way for you, keep doing what you're doing to keep yourselves safe."
"Goverment just announced in a ""boletin"" that all hotels etc should close by the 26th"
"Post 170, wanderingloiner, a tough ask but fingers crossed that these measures work & we can stay clear of it. A bit of warmth / heat would help but that's not looking likely for the foreseeable future."
stay where you are
Looks like another 15 days of lockdownhttps://english.elpais.com/politics/2020-03-…
"Total lockdown, stay at home"
Surprised italy took so long. Day eight here.Ports and airports shut. Over 460 deaths in one day in spain today.a sad record
"All shops and businesses (except supermarkets, tobacconists and pharmacies) are closed - including bars, restaurants etc. The beaches are cordoned off and the police and army are patrolling the streets - fining anyone outdoors for no legitimate reason."
"Some businesses re opened on monday.construction, industry, gestors etc. As the economy was taken out of hibernation mode. there is more traffic on the roads now as infection rates continue to drop.the goverment is thinking about allowing kids outside before the 26th deadline.The legion based at ronda have been helping with roadblocks in nerja and the surrounding towns and helping at velez hospital. Only a handful of them."
Hi I’m a big fan of Nerja it is such a beautiful place. We have been there 5 times now. We had thought about moving there but after reading something on one of these forums I’m not so sure now. The person was saying that he lives in Nerja but was desperate to get back to the uk because he has been a victim of burglaries by the Nigerians that sell things on the beach and that he has been terrorised by them and having their property broken into!! Have you heard of such things happening? Thanks.
"Post 180""Have you heard of such things happening"" Nope. And the looky looky people (beach sellers) are from Senegal not Nigeria."
"Post #180It's well known that Nerja has had issues with drugs and robberies etc, and also late last year problems with the vagrants blighting the area, but I've not heard of the issue you're referring to. That doesn't mean to say that it's not happened - if you trust the source then one has to presume it's reliable.Many places are not the quiet idyllic resorts they once were unfortunately. Having said that, Nerja does have a lot to offer."
"I have not heard of any similar incidents to be fair but that doesn’t mean it’s not happened, At the moment there aren’t any sellers around as there are hardly any people around full stop so his problem may cease. I have never been subject to any crime in fact I haven’t even seen as much as a fight. In the summer I have heard of tourists having their bags snatched and then there are opportunistic thefts as people leave their phones and bags lying on tables outside. For me it certainly feels very safe and apart from some very bad driving in town it’s great! Try reading some of the local press online and you will be able to ascertain the crime levels and whats happening in Nerja and if it’s somewhere you could live or not."
Home breakins are issues at times. they will be when theres a huge amount of empty houses and holiday homes which are easy pickings for electronic goods and cash.Normally involves gangs who travel from one area to another.you get a cluster and then nothing.but they tend to be groups from morocco and eastern europe aswell as home grown.never heard of involvment by the lookie guys.The CDS still has its rep especially on the west coast but unless you are an irish or swedish etc etc gangster or highend drug lord then you should be ok!
"I think this old post from a year or 2 ago sums it up, https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g315… Most places have some crime elements, mostly petty stuff like pickpocketing/bag snatch etc. Keep your wits about you and take the same precautions you would at home."
"Post 185. It certainly does sum it up! The man of infinite names ;-)) As for the ""Impact of Coronavirus"", Malaga province is now in Phase 1 (of 4) & some bars & restaurants are slowly reopening, also people are getting a little more freedom - but we'll have to wait a bit longer to see if that has had any impact on the virus."
"I do hope this doesnt refer to me Violette ""The man of infinite names ;-))"" semi friendly wink or not I can assure you since joining TA in 2008 as Mantalk it remains the ONLY name/profile or whatever else you wish to call it, that i have used."
"Post 187, not at all - you were not even on the page you referenced in your post..I assumed that you would be astute enough to understand the poster with infinite names."
