Will be in St. John's for 5 days. Should we rent a car or moped to go to the beaches? And what rental company is best recommendation?
There's no way I would rent a moped! I've never ever seen anyone rent a moped either. A car is the best way to go and there's plenty of companies on island to choose from. We've been happy with St. John Car Rental and Courtesy Car Rental. Good luck!
thanks!
Car!
They do rent them now but doing this is close to suicidal.
"They do have scooters on St John. I saw several pulled over by the Caneel overlook in April. After a light shower, the road was probably slick and one of the scooters was down and the two passengers were pretty scaped up. A great way to ruin your vacation in my opinion. Get a Jeep."

"We rent on St. Thomas and take the car ferry over. That gives us the opportunity to shop on STT and get around on STJ. If you rent on STJ, be mindful of the ""extra hour"" rate. I had a friend rent and decide to keep the car for an extra day. Instead of charging them for one more day, they charged them $20 per hour...for the full 24 hours."
"Although I would recommend a car, I think I would be interested in renting a scooter next time I visit. It is definitely not a place for inexperienced riders. All the horror stories about scooters seem overblown to me. A careful, experienced rider should be able to navigate the island quite nicely on a scooter.The problem doesn't seem to be the mode of transportation, but the capability of the operator. Also, doubling up on a scooter is just plain stupid in my opinion. Riding on wet roads, again, stupid. At the end of the day, renting 2 scooters would probably cost as much as a car, so there's your answer, unless you are really into scooters."

"""All the horror stories about scooters seem overblown to me. A careful, experienced rider should be able to navigate the island quite nicely on a scooter.""Is that so? With all due respect you are so wrong in your estimation. St Thomas is WAY more navigable than St John and, frankly, I wish the government would ban the use of these wretched rental scooters as they're a total menace. The reporting of the numerous accidents that tourists have with them fall by the wayside and very few of the incidents (some quite serious) reach the newspaper, A chat with any of the hospital's ER nurses on the subject turns up a ton of stories to make your hair curl.I (a 28 year resident) and many of my friends and acquaintances can attest to personal experiences involving clipping them, near misses and witnessing many an accident involving them skidding and falling over on even dry and straight roads. When you drive an SUV or similar you can't even see the things, they're so close to the ground and appear out of nowhere. Come around one of our many blind corners and there they are right in the middle of the lane going 10MPH and you're on them before you know it. I see one of them and take a WIDE berth as I don't need any more heart rushes and white knuckles from so many such close encounters.If you think you can handle driving a scooter on STJ during your vacation, do be sure to have all your insurance premiums paid up, get your affairs in order and sign up for emergency medical airlift to a stateside hospital (MASA has an office here). Better safe than sorry."
"I would definitely recommend a Jeep or something similar. We rented a Suzuki Vitara from C&C. The biggest advantage, beyond the safety aspect, is the ability to load the vehicle with beach chairs, coolers, snorkel gear, etc."
"Did you not read my post? I said EXPERIENCED riders. Furthermore, I didn't recommend them renting one.Just because inexperienced people can't handle a moped, that is no reason to ban them. It's operator error, and simply people who have no business being on a bike.Any EXPERIENCED motorcycle rider will tell you that you are on your own out there and you should just assume that no one sees you. You are the one responsible for your safety. I think Saint John would be an AWESOME place to ride for an EXPERIENCED rider!Just because some people can't walk and chew gum at the same time is no reason to ban hubba bubba!"
"Furthermore, Saint Thomas is not WAY more navigable than Saint John. You said it yourself, Traffic is the problem. There isn't nearly as much traffic on Saint John.Dbags driving way too fast in their SUV's on Saint Thomas are an epidemic!"
You have lost your mind if you rent a scooter St. John.
"I can read and did. I still beg to disagree with you and my disagreement is based, with all due respect, on way more knowledge and experience of island driving, drivers and accidents than the very little you've been exposed to. Do what you will. No point killing the messenger ...Interesting that you think St John is as easily navigable as St Thomas. In that case it's hard to imagine why the rental car agencies on STJ only carry 4WD vehicles, and rental car agencies on STT who carry both 2WD and 4WD vehicles will only rent the latter to people whose vacation destination is STJ. I suppose the reason for that is just to make more money and nothing to do with safety.And by the way, the fast-driving ""dbags"" you refer to are more likely to be driving souped-up Hondas with parts scavenged from stolen vehicles than SUVs."
"Jeep! I've driven all over the carribean, it was the craziest of them all. The roads are up and down and constantly winding and the locals drive like maniacs and drive over center line all the time. Buses and safari taxis are the worst. That being said, I had a great time driving it. C&C treated us fine, the jeep was good too."
"STT, as usual, is very wise in these matters.While living on STJ, my boyfriend had a motorcycle AND a jeep. The motorcycle was only for sunny days from home, just outside of Cruz Bay, to Cruz Bay.NEVER in the rain, NEVER on the North Shore Road and NEVER to Coral Bay.Scooters are not a safe choice, experienced rider or not."
"Anyone who would want to rent a scooter on STJ, no matter how experienced is a bit misguided and anyone who has been there and still thinks it is a good idea is a bit crazy (IMO)! To me it is like riding a bike in Boston traffic (CRAZY!!!)"

"The main reason people are saying it is a bad idea has nothing to do with the experience of the scooter driver, it has more to do with the person in the bigger car. Guess who loses."
"Scooters would be a blast to drive and far better for the environment on STJ than Jeeps. Jeeps are fun, but way overkill."
"I don't even know why I am beating this dead horse! Of course other vehicles are bigger, and win in accidents! That happens everywhere! Wouldn't it be easier to avoid someone riding the middle line if you were able to hug the left side of the road?By your rationale, people should also be scared to death to walk anywhere on the island, at least without full body armor!Once again, any EXPERIENCED rider knows that their safety is in their own hands. Your head should be on a swivel looking for bad drivers, and your ears should be wide open listening for other vehicles! You are MUCH more aware of your surroundings on a scoot!I agree that a scooter accident would ruin your vacation. So would stepping on a sea urchin, so you better stay out of the water. Sun poisoning would also be horrible, better stay off the beach. Can't go hiking, you might get dehydrated. And God forbid you go on a boat and get Seasick! While we are at it, Many of the restaurants could potentially give you food poisoning, so you better not eat. And scorpions, My God the Scorpions! Don't forget Death Apples and falling coconuts. Wow! I can't imagine why anyone would tread on such a dangerous island. If you go diving you could get decompression sickness, or eaten by a barracuda. And Fishing Hooks wow is that a dangerous implement! I guess the best advice is to just stay away. SNARK!Don't ride in the rain. One person per scoot. More power the better. Take it easy and you'll be fine on a scoot, or maybe you won't! Such is life!"
"Questions about bikes or scooters are usually asked by people who haven't been to STJ. If someone has been on the island, it's pretty obvious to them if they want to ride there or not. Posters may not realize it, but the question that they need to ask is about the terrain and road conditions. This may be the clearest way to answer the question:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PITOhT4n5R0"
"In recent years, I have noticed more younger locals with crotch rockets and even saw a chopper out on the East End. Scootering to the beach is just not what most of us would find fun or even practicle. There is a market on STJ since I have seen them more frequently in the past few years."
