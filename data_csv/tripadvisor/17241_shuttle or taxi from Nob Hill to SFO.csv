I was going to hoof it down to the Powell BART station Sunday (tomorrow) morning and catch it from there to SFO but the first one doesn't get to Powell until 8:30 am according to their schedule. My plane leaves at 8:30 so I have to find an alternate way to go. Can anyone recommend some other form of transportation that won't break my back account? I'm going to reserve about $60 (this includes tip).
"With the Bay Bridge closure (and it being Halloween), it looks like BART will be having overnight service: bart.gov/news/â€¦news20091030a.aspxHowever, you can do SF->SFO in a cab for under $60 including tip. Especially that early in the morning. Likely about $40-45 on the meter."
"Even if the trains were running, it's a long walk from where you are staying to Powell St. BART. I don't know how much luggage you have, but you don't really want to 1) carry it by hand or 2) fight to control your wheeled luggage down those steep hills.Your cab fare will be $45 or less, including tip, going by this handy chart.http://www.taxifarefinder.com/rates.phpP.S. It is almost 11:00 a.m. and the fog is still as thick as mustard up here. I can't see anything beyond about 100 yards."
"P.S. Airport shuttles will be less than $29, including tip."
"FRR .. the fog is still thick ""down here"" too ... and fog horns going like crazy. I use Lorrie's shuttle which is $15 (or $17, I'm having a senior moment) if you book in advance: http://www.gosfovan.com/ They generally schedule to pick up about 2.5 hours before your flight."
"* ""P.S. Airport shuttles will be less than $29, including tip."" *I meant to say less than $20. There must be an epidemic of seniormomentitis going around."
Hi - we only paid $20 plus tip for airport shuttle from our hotel.
"Well, I think I'm doing okay. I walked two blocks over to the Fairmont Hotel and pleasantly asked the nice gentlemen at the concierge desk if they knew of any shuttles to the airport. They said they use a shuttle for their guests. I asked if non-guests are able to use this service and they said yes but that I'd have to walk to their hotel to get their shuttle. I didn't mind that I was going to walk since it's just a carryon I'm rolling there. So I paid my $4 to reserve a spot and will pay the driver the balance. Thank you Mr. Wolfe at the Fairmont!I'll be sad to leave this wonderful city by the bay but I made sure I had great memories. Will be back next year, for sure! Thanks for all your help and quick responses."
I take it you didn't keep the rental car for the last day of your stay? When and where did you turn it in?
"I've used cityrentacar.com for the past three years and they've been really good. This time I rented one for two days. I picked it up at 10:00 Thursday and dropped it off around noon Friday (I intended to bring it back at 5 but had to come back earlier). The car I reserved online was in the shop which was one that had unlimited miles on it. Since it wasn't available they gave me this Mini Cooper Clubman for the same rate with unlimited miles (it's usually 50 miles max per day). When I returned it the next day they only charged me for one day, so it all totalled under $55 for the whole rental. Sweet deal for me, yeah?"
