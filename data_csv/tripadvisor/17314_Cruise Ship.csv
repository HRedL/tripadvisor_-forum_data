"I am a young female from California, and I am planning to go on a cruise in the Carribean, with Royal Carribean. We will go through San Juan, Barbados, and some other islands around there that I don't currently recall. I am going with my father (in his early 70s). He has Emphysema, and he grew up with athsma, so his immune system is weak. However, he is pretty healthy in the sense that he takes walks to exercise. I was wondering, I have heard about diseases that you could get on cruise ships, and in the Carribean (typhoid, rubella, etc). For those who have been on Royal Carribean, do they have clean practices?Does it seem like a bad idea for my father to go? Or am I just being paranoid?Are there any diseases that are common on ships or the Carribean that I have not mentioned?Thank you."
"I think your father will be fine. I haven't heard of anyone getting sick, except for sea sickness. I understand how you feel though.We cannot have dad getting sick. Check with his doctor and maybe the doctor can give him an immune efficiency shot or meds. AlsoBring disinfective wipes, hand sant, and only drink bottle water. Pray and you and dad will be fine. God bless you!!!!"
"We have had an on-going Dengue epidemic here in Puerto Rico since October of 2012, that shows no signs of letting up. Insect repellent with DEET will fend off mosquitoes."
"There are no major diseases to worry about in the Caribbean. Dengue is always a concern, but the SJ tourist area is not as affected by mosquitos as other areas more inland. So don't worry about it.Influenza season is here, but due to your father's history he has probably been vaccinated already. If not, he should do so. Same for you. Talk w his/your doctor about this.Every once in a while there are GI outbreaks in cruises, but I've never heard of one from RC. Make sure to Wash your hands before eating.Cruises have a doctor on board and even an operating room. I once got an allergic reaction and was treated promptly. So if anything happens there will be someone to help you. Consider purchasing travel insurance just in case.With the info you are giving I see no reason why your father should not go, but if you are worried you should talk to his doctor. Maybe they will recommend other vaccinations or give you different medication for the trip."
"I've been on a royal carribean cruise, though not in the caribbean. The boat was very clean and we did not get sick at all. Just use common sense like washing your hands. Your dad should also talk to his doctor about the cruise to make sure it's okay. Have a great time."
"I suggest you ask this question again on a Royal Caribbean forum in Cruise Critic (that you should join). Saying that the only ""outbreaks"" on RC is sea sickness, is not a wise comment! A typical problem that can effect ANY ship is norovirus, which is a common winter-frequent outbreak. Common procedures onboard include being given hand sanitizer everytime you go near a buffet venue and often limiting passengers self-service for the first 3 days of a cruise. The prominent sympton is GI and people who become sick may be quaranteened to their cabins (not fun, but a balcony improves the situation). Last winter we were on Holland America out of Ft. Lauderdale for 14 nights and the captain was careful. In addition, we were warned that two of the ships at port in St. Thomas with us were very involved with norovirus, and we were told to avoid passengers from others ships during our day! All said, we are careful and have never had any problem. The focused issue is that people who get on a ship with a GI virus can easily spread it on the close environment of a cruise ship. My best."
"Cruise lines in general are very good at keeping things clean in order to avoid viruses. However, some are unavoidable (as are taxes). During the time I worked with Royal Caribbean (onboard, and directly with the Captain), and I never heard of anyone getting sick on any of the ships with anything out of the ordinary: motion sickness, stomach virus, or any other minor virus that can spread if proper measures aren't taken. As mentioned above, viruses can spread on ANY cruise liner, not just Royal Caribbean's. You may also catch viruses on aircrafts, malls, restaurants, offices, and other public spaces. Cruise ships are no different.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I would say that a cruise ship is more like a class of preschoolers up north during February. Unlike the other settings you mention, people do not eat in close quarters, attend social events daily in close settings, and, I would say, its not in general the specific ship or cruise line, but who is getting on at any time. For example, during the winter or in a cruise setting where the ship fills in New Jersey and for three nights is at sea before releasing folks onto an island? We often hear of troubled ships (just seems they are likely to be Carnival here at Galveston, but there is nothing unique about the virus being cruise ship-related, just setting related. Sort of like some medical phenomenon is a residential school?Still suggest if the lady in question is concerned that she ask her questions on a Cruise Critic forum as many people are in her situation (i.e. taking a parent on a cruise). It is obviously good to get both information and reassurance -- although I guess you are familiar with the elderly that do not give up cruising and the need for a mortician to meet a vessel at the home port is not so unusual."
We do have many of People with Asthma and Allergies in Puerto Rico. When it's rains we have a lot of fungi in the Air. Just in case I would use a face mask if it rains while he is here. Better save then sorry.
