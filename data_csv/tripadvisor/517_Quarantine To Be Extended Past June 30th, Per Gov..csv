Ige announced today that he will be extending the 14 days quarantine for all arrivals beyond June 30th.He did not give specifics (please see linked article).https:/…
"Here's specific info:""The governor says a mandatory, 14-day quarantine for mainland and international travelers will be extended beyond June 30."" and""Gov. David Ige made the announcement Thursday in a virtual gathering with Hawaii’s four mayors.""You can watch the virtual meeting if you'd like, via the link I posted.SW"
So no way many bars and restaurants will open before August - the ones that derive most revenue from visitors.
"Nope. I'd heard many weren't even trying to open until fall already. Ige has been saying September for ""opening"" for weeks already.......but this is the first official statement."
SWWe agree. The bars and restaurants that derive most of their revenue from tourists will not open until tourist visitation returns in substantial numbers - who knows when that will happen
"Why pick a date? As if the calendar has any relevance to a Virus, It's not on a timer is it?Needs to list specific conditions he is looking for were he feels it is safe. Will it be a vaccine? An effective treatment? Otherwise conditions remain now as they did 2 months ago.Edited: 9:34 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"Yep, Ducks :-). In addition to lack of customers, there are the huge expenses involved with running a greatly reduced operation (due to new capacity limits, etc.). The thing people keep forgetting (or maybe don't know) is that travel ***everywhere*** is expected to be much reduced for the rest of 2020. Many people don't want to fly, no matter where. They don't even want to drive long distances (like over 500 miles each way). There have been numerous polls and media blurbs about it. Millions of people wouldn't come even if the quarantine was lifted. And the airlines aren't going to add back a bunch of flights until they make more economic sense to fly (as in more passengers). Opening hotels, shops, restaurants, etc., etc.---HUGE operating costs for ???? income. Not near enough, folks--and it's NOT because of the quarantine.Hawaii isn't the source of the 'slowdown'. The virus is. Until people feel more safe and more comfortable, travel will stay depressed, at least through most of 2020. Given the rise in cases and deaths in the states that opened early, I can't see that changing.........Edited: 9:39 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"Mahalo for your posts, SW. September has, I think, a reasonable expectation of being the time that the 14-day quarantine may be lifted, which is why I have been recommending that people not plan trips here in July or August. But the actual timing will, of course, be dictated by the virus and observing the effects of ""opening"" in other places."
"Mahalos in return, Wahine :-).Yep, I think many of us have expected September for a while now.....and tried to say so. I get that people have ""cabin fever"" or whatever--but they also don't understand that the Hawaii of their minds or memories is NOT what they would experience now. Quarantine or not, most tourists wouldn't be very happy with how things are. I don;t think most would be until at least November (as I've also said)...when more things are open and maybe calmer.They just finished a study in France that showed 1 in 10 people with diabetes (Type 1 or 2) died within a week of getting COVID-19. Given our very high rate of diabetes (esp among Native Hawaiians), that is horrible news and a big red flag. Opening too soon could wreak mortal havoc on a very vulnerable and large population here. In addition to Wisconsin, cases are increasing in North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, California, and many international places. Washington is seeing more and more cases among younger people (they are almost 50% of new cases now); Virginia, Arizona, and some other areas are trending upward too.......and we won't even talk about what's ahead possibly from the Lake of the Ozarks fiasco. This isn't even the famous ""second wave"". We've never finished the first wave, worldwide.Edited: 10:09 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"Hey SWI agree, it's definitely not the second wave, and maybe there will never be one in the US because containment is/was so poorly done. But if there is one, or at least a large increase in cases, Hawaii would be opening at exactly the wrong time.I agree with the early Hawaii government's policies, but I think they are beginning to make wrong choices..."

Hey Dayton you know you don't have to read any of this right? Just checking to see if you know how forums work...
"Thank you, Dayton, JG. That is an awesome post. I can quit writing my own material and just repost yours whenever I feel the urge to respond!>>>However, why do I get the feeling that those who are the most upset about this will still return to Hawaii later...<<<That is the powerful draw Hawaii has on the rest of the world. As we've traveled from Australia to France to Japan, we've constantly met people who've told us it's their ""Life's Dream"" to visit Hawaii. Ain't that something?Lucky we live Hawaii, brah. Hope to see you soon!"
You do know that cases are increasing because testing is increasing. Many of the people are asymptomatic or have had very minor symptoms.
"LoL. I have to admit, Dayton's post made me laugh. Of course it may just be the DC region finally went into Phase I reopening today and I'm giddy. And on my way to celebrate with food. Even if it is just a cheeseburger at a local place that was allowed to open today. Well, sort of open. They're allowed to open only 4 of their 8 outside tables and no inside tables. It's hard to imagine restaurants recovering and surviving this indefinitely, when open isn't really ""open"". But I'll do my part to help the local guys around the corner fill one of their four tables and have a cheeseburger and fries.No, I think Dayton's post really did just make me laugh!!"
"Personally, I think it's good for the the governor to continue setting ""no earlier than..."" dates. By doing this, people can make definitive plans and move on. We have a trip booked for mid-July. Booked it last fall. Now I know that we do not want to pay the next installment on the condo and we'll wait for Hawaiian to officially cancel our flights, so we can get money back or credit. Now the decision is off the table and I don't have to have the ""how lucky do I feel"" discussion about safety on long plane flights and ""will we get to enjoy anything there"". Decision is made for us and we can get on with it.And I hope we get to go in 2021, where I'm suddenly thinking our room and dining budgets will go up. :)"
"Dang, I missed the fun again. What did Dayton say and why was it clicked out???"
Yes please . Do tell .
"I missed it tooDo tell,,,,, we all need a laugh/chuckle now"
"Slim version: Essentially, Dayton suggested that all the folks/would-be vacationers who are complaining about decisions made by Maui, about Maui (i.e. quarantine requirements, etc.) should, how do I put this... STFU. :-)"
"Reau, you always have such well thought out and sincere responses, that made me truly laugh out loud! Thanks for my morning chuckle!"
"Glad to have contributed to your morning chuckle, Wagges, though the credit really goes to Dayton. That post put a smile on my face too."
"I didn't get to see it, but I am glad you were able to eloquently relay his sentiment. ;)"
"From my post #12 >>>Thank you, Dayton, JG. That is an awesome post. I can quit writing my own material and just repost yours whenever I feel the urge to respond!<<<Dayton's post did not violate any TA terms and should be reinstated."
"yes, I think I agree with Dayton :) I've been avoiding these discussions mostly because IMO 95% is just speculation. Lately though the complainers and protesters are bugging me. I don't live on Maui so I would not think to criticize their decisions and I support the Governor. I think the protesters do more harm than good. By good, I mean don't they know that we all hope Maui, and everywhere else, get back to normal asap? But following the safety guidelines is what will get us there. We see the wild scenes at Lake Ozark, and elsewhere and then wonder why Maui is reluctant to let mainlanders in?Grandeau - Ige has not given ""no sooner than"" dates. He merely said the quarantine will be extended past June 30. No one in authority has said this will extend to the fall or beyond till 2021 despite it being said all the time on social media. Me, I just hang in there and long for the day this is but a memory, But you know what? Many residents seem to hope for less tourism and maybe most of the Gov. Ige haters, and protesters will decide not to vacation on Maui anymore as they are threatening. Could be a win-win."
"Peacenik, a win/win? Well said, thank you."
"Man, I honestly didn't post anything remotely hostile, but for those that missed it, Reau summed it up. In the meantime, I asked TA to reinstate the post (never had to do that before).Just for reference...since the Covid, I've had a serious hankering for Lou Malnati's and Portillos. And I've never had the chance to go on the First Lady Architecture Tour. But what good does it do to question the policies of a city and a state that I don't live in? IMO, only the constituents should have a say. Whether they say keep it closed all summer or protest to open up ASAP, that's on them, not some schmuck who lives in a nearby state who craves a pie and an Italian beef."
"I think the quarantine is fine but the state should consider marketing it as a benefit. Some visitors may appreciate being in a COVID-free location in exchange for staying for two weeks plus however much time they want for touring. For people that are on lock-down elsewhere, being on lockdown for 14 days in a Hawaiian hotel or condo with a view would be a huge upgrade. So they spend two weeks enjoying the view with food delivered, then they are free to roam with far fewer tourists than normal. Pretty much every visitor to the islands says at some point ""I'd love to spend a month or more here sometime"", well, for those that can afford it, now might be the time. The state could keep the quarantine and continue to open sites and services as appropriate. The marketing campaign practically writes itself."
"YYZ, the guv and others are ahead of you. They've been suggesting Hawaii market itself as ""safer"" than other destinations already."
"LOL, JG--you've always been so polite--and I bet your post will get reinstated. Too bad you injured some snowflake's feelings!People who don't like Hawaii's laws, rules, and concerns have every right to that opinion. They don't have a right to tell us to do what they want, though. Like I said recently to one very negative poster, if he wants to make rules and laws for Hawaii, he should move to Oahu and run for office.Edited: 3:02 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"Considering that some visitors are not even aware of the quarantine requirements, I'm not so sure how far ahead they are."
I said suggesting ...as in discussing the idea.How could visitors not be aware of the quarantine????
"How can people be unaware of the quarantine? As I've said before, it isn't news here. The Seattle Times had an article a couple of weeks ago ~ reprinted from elsewhere; can't recall the original source. Aside from that, if I didn't hang out on this forum, or wasn't a researcher by nature, I wouldn't be aware. I could hop online, book a flight, and reserve a car, and come across no mention of the quarantine. Booking a place to stay would be a different matter, but hey, there are people who hit the road (so to speak) without lodging lined up.~ Colleen"
"Alaska has just announced that all people visiting will have to have a negative test or be quarantined for 2 weeks:https:/…8882421c737cc5928daeebd6858193f4There have been plenty of articles all over the country about Hawaii's quarantine. AP, NYT, WAPO, NBC, MSN, CNN, and more.Before booking a ticket on United, there's a nice pop-up about restrictions for travelers going to HI (I did a dummy booking for SEA-HNL just now). When you click on it, it leads you to very specific info:https:/…notices.html"
"Just for fun, I checked American, Delta, and Hawaiian too. American's notice isn't very good. The other two are totally clear.Expedia also has a couple of nice clear notices."
"I'm giving you an answer, SW, as a well-informed person on the mainland. I don't watch any televised news, though. I rely most often on the NY TImes, NPR, and Reuters, as well the Seattle Times for regional news. Your perspective differs in part because you're particularly looking for Hawaii-related articles. It's akin to buying a vehicle and suddenly seeing ""more"" of the same cars on the road. When I log in to my Alaska & Delta accounts, I'm able to book flights without being alerted to the quarantine. Interesting that you're seeing something different!~ Colleen"
"Since I use Alaska Airlines and currently have been monitoring the situation for my own flight planning, from the mainland, here is exactly (cut and pasted from) what I see when trying to book a ticket to...anywhere. This is the first thing I see at the very top of the page when using the alaskair.com website;View all the latest coronavirus travel updates. <<<<<<<<<<No change/cancellation fees for travel through December 31, 2020. View details.Mask and face covering requirements. View details.Travel restrictions are in effect for multiple regions. View regional advisories.Was your flight changed or canceled? View your optionsThe hyperlink used above, then takes you to a list of areas of travel advisories, Hawaii's is C&P'd as follows:Travel to HawaiiThe State of Hawaii is requiring all arriving guests to self-quarantine for a period of up to 14 days (or the duration of your stay, whichever is shorter). This mandatory self-quarantine applies to both visitors and returning residents, and is in effect for all islands served by Alaska Airlines.All travelers are required to stay in your place of residence or in your hotel room/rented lodging for the duration of the self-quarantine. You can only leave your designated quarantine location for medical emergencies or to seek medical care. Food must be delivered at your own expense. All vacation rentals are officially closed and are not permitted as a quarantine location. Upon arrival, non-residents of Hawaii will be required to provide your intended length of stay and return flight confirmation.Failure to follow this order is a misdemeanor and punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000 and/or 1-year imprisonment.The State of Hawaii has launched a web application to collect traveler information. Prior to arrival, guests can now enter their information directly on the State’s Safe travels website.This indicates a link to an external site that may not follow the same accessibility or privacy policies as Alaska Airlines. By selecting a partner link you agree to share your data with these sites. For more information, including the enhanced verification process for all arriving passengers, please visit the Hawaii State Department of Transportation COVID-19 website.This indicates a link to an external site that may not follow the same accessibility or privacy policies as Alaska Airlines. By selecting a partner link you agree to share your data with these sites. However, maybe Coleen is using the Alaska Air mobile application (not my personal preferred preference)...I tried using that as well and it is certainly NOT as clear nor as informative as Alaska's actual website."
"Thanks, Craig. That's really detailed. I didn't look at Alaska.3 more new cases today--one on Maui for the first time in a while :-(.Like I said, I have seen headline articles in many news sources.........not Hawaii based ones."
"While catching up on other news....I clicked on the Travel News button for CNN. This article from a few weeks ago is still on the first page:https:/…index.htmlI'm curious to see how Alaska's (the State, not the airline) new policy goes. It's basically what our govt. wants to do here........a positive test, no fly unless you agree to quarantine for 2 weeks. Thing with that idea is *how strict* will the quarantine checks be? Given that we just deported another quarantourist from Maui last night, and how tired people are of them--I think the reporting and calling them in will increase, not drop."
"Thinking out loud...........all the protests and riots across the mainland are very likely to cause some increases in CV-19 cases. Washington DC, Washington state, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, New York, Georgia, Kentucky, Utah, Illinois, and Texas are just *some* of the states with protests or riots happening. Most of these district/states already have pretty high CV-19 rates, even if they have plateaued. After all this???? Well, I would guess there will be spikes in at least some of them. And it won't all be the ""bad guys"" getting sick.........it'll be the cops, civilians, Ntl. Guard, fire, and medic responders too. Some of those people who might have been able to afford or want a trip to Hawaii this summer, in other words."
"On the plus side, anyone marching into a protest zone will likely be masked given the tear gas and all. Peace be with you."
"SW, The various articles refer to the requirement that visitors provide the location of their hotel. Are there many hotels operational at this point?"
"If you watch many of the videos in different cities...not really. Many weren't masked (and those don't do a thing against tear gas or pepper spray).Re the hotels--several are still open on each island. Condos through Outrigger and Aston are also open, since they are hotel operations."
"Hawaiian airlines have not cancelled July flights yet. The government needs to be transparent so people who cannot travel to Hawaii can start getting refunds. The government claims that they want to maintain their relationship with Hawaiian airlines but are choosing to prioritize a relationship with the prosperous (wealthy) of the international market. Meanwhile, fellow middle class (not all are poor or cheap!) US mainland travelers have their money at the mercy of the airlines, who are at risk for failure and do not want to issue refunds. Decent people have agreed to be tested to protect the Hawaiian people but it seems that is not good enough for the politicians (and the locals that have allowed fear and hatred in their heart). Sad to see this."
What do you mean about International travelers?  They are subject to the exact same quarantine.
"One time poster EA. With issues, and such a descriptive name EA. :)"
And what happens if in 2 weeks there is no spike in Covid cases? Will people be able to admit that for the average person Covid-19 is not that contagious?
"Will people in all those places get tested in 2 weeks?Or should Hawaii just trust them? Cause you know, they might not die---even if they infect others.Edited: 1:25 am, May 31, 2020 "
"""Will people be able to admit that for the average person Covid-19 is not that contagious?""I am not aware of any conclusive evidence that this statement is true."
"Lynn, I’m also wondering what leads you to say this. Viruses are, by their very nature, contagious. Maybe you were implying something else...?~ Colleen"
"@lynn - not contagious? What? Maybe not as deadly as once thought, but definitely contagious. What is there, like six million cases around the world right now?"
"Like I posted in another thread...the protests and riots are an issue *to me*, now. Why? Because I have seen so many photos, videos, comments, etc--with people unmasked, crowded together, hugging, on and on. Every day they have grown more, and so have the exposures.There are protests in more than 75 cities right now-with no signs of slowing down. National Guard troops have been called up and brought in (more people to get infected and spread it when they go home). Many of the people rioting or protesting live in active areas (as I said yesterday). The possible explosion of cases from these events is huge. Mayors and Governors are saying the same thing-it's not just crazy SW.Another thing--I find it interesting that no one has countered a post I did about how few people want to get on a plane or travel far from home until at least the end of 2020. People are talking about short road trips (500 miles each way), camping near home, visiting places around them. No one wants to comment on the study that shows 1 in 10 diabetes patients die within the first week of CV-19......even though I pointed out that Hawaii and esp. Native Hawaiians have a very high rate of diabetes.Stop demonizing Hawaii for wanting to try and protect its vulnerable population and limited medical resources. Demonize the virus and other things/people that could actually stop some of the tragedy, deaths, destruction, and bloodshed.Edited: 6:58 am, June 01, 2020 "
I know the news seems terrible especially early on. My small office of 250 has had 40 cases and all recovered without any hospitalizations. Yes most under 50 and all healthy. Just paid to stay home for 2 weeks. I think Hawaii's lack of experience is causing the current measures.
Weren't you lucky!You didn't address my points. What you have is not what we have.
SW everything you say is correct. I just don't think a lock down and quarantine at the expense of those healthy and not at risk is the only way to protect the vulnerable . As a visitor I am looking forward to the benefits. Not sure how the flights will turn out. Again you are correct . Not sure the percentage of people wanting to fly before a vaccine. But they already have plans to promote Hawaii as the safest place. I think the tourism board is the best run dept in the state.
"“(T)he protests and riots are an issue *to me*, now.”I hope/assume the protests/riots are an issue to everyone, everywhere, for obvious reasons. Insofar as the crowding & exposure, you can imagine that if it’s a concern to you, so distanced, it’s even more worrisome to those of us here. The reason I (and others?) didn’t respond to your conjecture about what people are willing to do wrt travel is because it’s just that: conjecture. Polls relayed in CNN (or whatever) are guessing games as much as anything else. A quick perusal of these forums points up the fact that plenty of posters here are ready & willing to travel, and not just by car or RV. ~ Colleen"
"Are they, really? Or are they talking about it? Many are people who are retired and could do the quarantine....but they don't want to.And sorry, but I read far more than CNN...and the topic has been quite interesting.Edited: 6:43 pm, June 02, 2020 "
Maybe not that deadly to the average under 75 healthy person.
The crap hasn’t hit the fan in states that opened up weeks ago which is the exact opposite of what everybody said would happen. In 2 weeks we will see what happens after all of the exposure. Although the exposure of the mass protests is not the kind of exposure one would get going on a vacation and sitting on a beach
"Hawaii’s Lieutenant Governor and emergency room doctor Josh Green ranked a list of 12 common activities from low to high risk with regards to COVID-19.Of the 12 activities listen, Green said ""water activities"" are the lowest-risk.""You're more likely to get attacked by a shark than catch COVID-19 underwater,"" Green said.12. Water activities11. Hiking10. Small backyard BBQ/Potluck9. Haircut8. Light contact sports (basketball, flag football)7. Restaurant diningGreen said dining can be done with low risk ""If you socially distance and if restaurants do a good job like I expect like they’re going to do masks and gloves and keeping parties separate.""6. Controlled indoor gathering (movie theater, religious service)5. Playgrounds""It will be difficult to make children aware of what we’re trying to do and it hurts a little to tell kids not to play like they’re used to,"" Green explained.4. Large outdoor gathering (graduation, wedding reception)""High risk, it's a celebration, people will tend to be forgetful about the six feet social distancing. We really are not encouraging anything over 10 people,"" Green said.3. Flying to the mainland2. Nightclub1. Visiting relatives in a nursing home""Not high risk for the visitor, it's very high risk for the individual in the nursing home. Even though the rate of transmission is low the mortality rate is very high,"" Green added."
"Re: dine-in restaurants - Dine-in in our state opened up a couple of weeks ago. We have dined in at a couple of restaurants near us since then. The restaurants handle it quite well. Menus are only used by 1 customer OR they are sanitized between uses (i.e., sprayed with alcohol and wiped down). Servers all wear masks and gloves. Tables are far apart from each other and are fully disinfected before the next set of customers are seated at that table...the entire table, the seat you sit on, the back of the chair, etc.Hawaii has made it pretty clear that ""outsiders"" are not welcome at all. Keep it up long enough, and everyone really WILL stay away for a very long time and the economic recovery will be devastating. It's easy for one to sit there in one's home and speak endlessly about keeping the islands in their own little bubble if you have no problems paying your bills. But when the lack of employment continues for long enough, Hawaii residents will end up moving to the mainland. It's very unfortunate situation.How can people NOT know? Well, Hawaii travel news is NOT widely broadcast on the mainland. Right now, it's hardly talked about at all. It shows up occasionally on the news for west coast cities, but not as much elsewhere. The only reason I know about what's going on is from coming here and from seeking out and reading local Hawaii news on Hawaiian news websites.I think that having to get a blood test in order to travel to Hawaii is ridiculous. There will eventually be a lawsuit over it if that stupid idea comes to fruition...it'll end up in the federal court system.The travel industry worldwide has basically been decimated over the last couple of months. Any area whose economy primarily relies on tourism is going to be reeling for a long time. Consider Arizona, where I live. Many people in the Phoenix area apparently own 2nd homes that they rent out through VRBO and AirBNB during baseball spring training. Well, guess what? As of a month ago, they are all trying to unload and sell those properties because now they can't pay their mortgage and they rely on being totally booked through spring training season in order to pay the mortgage through the rest of the calendar year.As a result, real estate prices in certain areas has seen an uptick in available properties for sale. On top of that, many people are out of work so there's fewer people looking to buy a home.Or consider places like Sedona, AZ, which totally relies on tourism. The entire town is built around it. No tourists since everybody is staying home? All of those hundreds of locally owned small businesses (restaurants, boutiques, shops, therapists who will realign your chakras with you out in the wilderness) have lost a LOT of business. Just like everybody in Hawaii has.Once the federal bail out money ends, THAT is when Hawaii's state government will open the state up for interstate and international commerce. Until then, Hawaii will continue to act as if it can live forever in a bubble protected from the outside world."
"Ok, I'm going to try again since my prior post got removed due to 'off topic chat' even though other posts in this thread are of the same nature and discuss off-topic items.The quarantine is ridiculous. Hawaii has made it clear that it doesn't want visitors of any kind. Locals have made that clear as well. Best of luck to the state in pulling itself out of financial ruin."
"Thanks for reinstating my post, TA!SE, much of what you say has happened in Hawaii before-and will this time too. Dropping the quarantine today wouldn't change that....because the people who would travel aren't going to be enough to ""make up"" the difference, so to speak. Airlines are still flying and still offering cheap tickets. And while tourist numbers are increasing, the planes sure ain't full. And that's the case for MOST destinations, not just Hawaii. So like I said--demonize someone/something else.............because like you pointed out, Hawaii isn't unique."
"What I find heartbreaking in this thread that include posts about the protest/riots is no mention of George Floyd. Yes, there is one that mentioned it in a round about way. That's it. What these past days have really showed me, as someone who grew up in the 60's/70's, is that as a nation we haven't made much progress in equality over the span of more than 50 years. We're too caught up in our own agenda and arguing whether we should keep out folks who want to vacation in Hawaii. How sad is that?"
Didn’t all the protesters this weekend violate the stay at home orders? Did they all get arrested? Or are arrests only for visitors?
"Well, my post was clicked out in #51---where yes, I mentioned ""in a roundabout way"" the issues and problems. TA reinstated it almost immediately, though.But to take this thread to comments about Mr. Floyd won't solve anything either. That's clearly off topic, and could get the thread closed. Maybe that's what some people want?The protests in Hawaii have been calm, respectful, and poignant-like the paddle out yesterday in Maui. The stay at home order had been loosened several weeks ago. People get arrested for violating **quarantine**.Edited: 12:36 pm, June 01, 2020 "
But don’t the current orders prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people and still require social distancing of 6 feet?
"Yeah.....so would you have had our police departments start a riot? Sorry--not happening, thank goodness.Let's stick to the topic--the quarantine."
"The quarantine is exactly the point of my comments. The orders are being ignored by the community and law enforcement. Yet, visitors are vilified, shamed, and arrested for not honoring the ‘quarantine.’"
"Let me repost what the quarantine is and does:The quarantine is absolute. You cannot leave your lodgings to shop, pick up food, walk the beach, play in the ocean, drive around, etc. You can only leave to depart the island or for medical care. Some Quarantourists who have flouted the rule and emergency order have been arrested and sent home; some have been cited after agreeing to more frequent checks by the authorities. The quarantine is 2 weeks, or 14 days long. It applies to all arrivals in the State---residents as well as tourists."
The language in the quarantine order is clear. I understand that. We have postponed our May trip this year and plan to visit as soon as the quarantine is lifted. My comments are aimed at the need for the orders. The community and government officials are not concerned about enforcing the orders that apply to local residents. Maybe they should revisit whether visitor restrictions are even necessary any more.
"""The orders are being ignored by the community and law enforcement. Yet, visitors are vilified, shamed, and arrested for not honoring the ‘quarantine'.""I cannot speak for the other islands, but I will say that here on Hawaii Island, the community is very much following the orders. I see everyone in stores wearing masks and keeping social distancing, and when beaches were off limits for sitting and sunbathing, people complied with that. Of course there are scofflaws in every community, and law enforcement was out there citing those scofflaws.To make a blanket statement that ""the community and law enforcement"" are ignoring the state and county level orders is completely erroneous. On the other hand, the people who choose to fly here right now seem to include a very high percentage of folks who only came because of the cheap airfares and have no consideration whatsoever for our communities. Those that come here and break the 14-day quarantine deserve every ounce of vilification and shaming that has been heaped on them."
"""The community and government officials are not concerned about enforcing the orders that apply to local residents.""How do you know this? Do enforcement agencies have the resources to know which residents are required to be under a 14-day self quarantine vs. those who aren't?"
"Since Lt. Governor Josh Green lists ""Flying to the mainland"" as one of the highest risk activities to engage in, with regard to Covid-19, I expect the quarantine to be extended until something is put in place to mitigate the risk.His full list of 12 activities, ranked from least to most riskiest with regard to Covid-19 is in post #59 of this thread."
"Did you see the protesters on the big island this weekend? They weren’t following orders. Government officials didn’t intervene, discourage, or arrest. So my statements are not completely erroneous. Btw it’s laughable that ‘completely erroneous’ blanket statement allegations are being made by somebody who labeled all visitors as inconsiderate cheapskates. The hypocrisy is real.Edited: 2:22 pm, June 01, 2020 "
A simple google search of Hawaii protests shows this.
"Folks here on Kauai are also living according to what orders are in affect from the gov and our mayor. Post #51 was there before I posted. I was actually referencing Colleen's post #55. No, I have no intention on posting things to get your thread pulled SW, with near automatic reinstatement what would be the point?If we can post about beloved musicians passing away and give condolences to family's of visitors that die on island there is no reason why I can't post my opinion about the reason we are having these protests and riots that have already been brought to our attention in this thread."
"""They weren’t following orders."" Which ""orders""? They may not have been at appropriate social distances, but I did note that a lot of folks were wearing masks. Didn't see any rioters though, which as far as I know, were the only times law enforcement agencies intervened during protests across the country. Despite ""orders"" restricting sizes of gatherings and to maintain social distancing."
"<< Do enforcement agencies have the resources to know which residents are required to be under a 14-day self quarantine vs. those who aren't? >>Apparently they do, at least here on Kauaʻi. DH has been in self-quarantine since coming back from the mainland last week, and we had a visit from two police officers yesterday to check on him."
Are we coming onto a full moon or something? People sure want to argue and quarrel.
"I don't mean to be rude but I sincerely doubt that anyone outside of Hawaii has any idea what's really going on here just by watching the news and reading social media (or even reading this forum). People are just struggling to make it through the day and to pay their bills and to feed their children. I've lived in Kailua Kona for 27 years and no one that I know is perseverating about tourists. Our conversations are about unemployment and how to help the families who have nothing and how grateful we are to be here with low COVID numbers and no riots. My sister and brother in law just moved back to the mainland after my brother in law was laid off from an executive position at one of the hotels here. Fortunately, he is at the age he can retire. Nobody I know hates tourists, we're are all just trying to figure out what the new normal may be just like everyone else."
Many people left Maui as well. Most were people with lower end jobs and newer transplants.
"#66 of 81 ·But don’t the current orders prohibit gatherings of more than 10 people and still require social distancing of 6 feet?#68 of 81 ·The quarantine is exactly the point of my comments. The orders are being ignored by the community and law enforcement. Yet, visitors are vilified, shamed, and arrested for not honoring the ‘quarantine.’#51 of 81 ·Like I posted in another thread...the protests and riots are an issue *to me*, now. Why? Because I have seen so many photos, videos, comments, etc--with people unmasked, crowded together, hugging, on and on. Every day they have grown more, and so have the exposures.So I’m lost. @SW, it seems like you think it’s better to not enforce Hawaii’s quarantine rules (re: the paddle out). But are concerned about the covid spreading happening as a result of mainland protests? Doesn’t breaking quarantine (to attend a protest) in Hawaii carry the same risks as anywhere else?It does sound like a double standard. Can you clarify?"
">>>It does sound like a double standard. Can you clarify?<<<Good morning bellyqueen. I'll take a chance at it:The extremely low incidence of Covid-19 on Maui among our population is a known factor: Days with no new cases; occasionally 1 new case. The health status of travelers arriving from the mainland to the Islands is an unknown factor.The quarantine for inter-island travel will be history in two weeks. The quarantine for travelers arriving from the mainland will remain in effect.Concern about we who live here spreading it among ourselves is less than concern about travelers bringing it in.BTW, paddling out in the ocean is the absolute lowest risk for Covid-19 according to Lt.Gov. Josh Green's ranking of activities and their risks, per the list I posted in post #59.And while I always say that complaining on Trip Advisor about how we handle our issues on Maui, which is of course permissible, is just so much chirping of so many Mynah birds, I strongly encourage those with legitimate concerns to contact the Mayor's office to express those views to our elected officials. They are there to listen, and welcome input from residents and visitors alike.County Of Maui Office Of The Mayor: (808) 270-7855Aloha! Pau for now!"
"Folks who live in Hawaii aren't quarantined as long as we have been on island for 15 days. Ocean activities are permitted. Stores and restaurants are either open or are opening. Parks and playgrounds, open. Churches open. All according to guidelines set forth by the CDC and local government. Swimming pools and gyms, open. Barber shops and salons, open."
"Not just people live in HI., but tourists who have served their time are able to do the same things (#84).Ref and protests: the paddle out was the better ""vehicle"" IMO...people are farther apart and touching or passing anything.The protests in Honolulu and on Maui by roadways were not ""perfect"". Then again...........nobody got arrested, beaten, choked out, gassed, or killed. So I think they were perfect. Discretion is the better part of valor in many, many incidents.And while *could be a bump* in cases from our homegrown protests, it sure won't be anything like all the mainland ones."
"@kaukau >>>>BTW, paddling out in the ocean is the absolute lowest risk for Covid-19<<<>>>And while I always say that complaining on Trip Advisor about how we handle our issues on Maui,<<<I wasn't speaking about the specific activity I was more asking about gathering for a protest in general, as in there are usually bystanders, curious onlookers, etc. at said events. Are you saying I'm complaining? or just posters in general? Nowhere in my post was I complaining, I was asking for clarification"
Just posters in general.
"I think people are just bored and it manifests as frustration. Humanity doesn't like the unknown. Look at all of us posting on these threads with recycled talking points, and other junk that has little to do w/ travel plans. The hard reality is that whether you're a traveller or a resident, your lives are different now. The stress of that comes out in unexpected ways. Some take it in stride better than others. I'm tired of all of it too, but this stuff is beyond all control."

"Scott, perhaps reading some threads and the Constitution will help you.By the way, his name is Ige. I'm not a fan, but you are really not well versed in this issue.SWEdited: 12:43 am, June 03, 2020 "
"The governor can talk all he wants about releasing 2-week quarantine restrictions for visitors from Alaska and Montana, but the 2019 numbers in terms of visitors from those 2 states aren't going to do anything to help bring Hawaii back from the brink of financial ruin.Opening travel to visitors from Japan will help, but the fact of the matter is that visitors from the rest of the US last year was 3x the total of visitors from Japan. Just Japanese and visitors from other Asian countries won't be sufficient."

Has the Gov. made a specific date to extend past June 30? I haven’t seen anything online or on TA.
"I have to disagree with the statement, ""have you seen how few people want to fly anywhere? How few people think they want to be more than a few hours away from home?"" I've heard from numerous friends, family members, and coworkers who have flown over the last few weeks and all said that planes were full and many airports were packed. Some were even bumped off their flights due to overbooking. We have two flights planned for next month, and based on the seating charts, they are nearly full as well. I think there is a pent-up demand to travel, and if the destination does not have onerous quarantine requirements, many people are choosing to go."
"I agree with Arlo. While I've read articles referring to a lack of interest in air travel, that's not the reality I'm hearing around me. Even these TA forums point up the fact that plenty of people intend to fly to destinations this summer. Curious that Ige mentioned 5-6 days ago extending the quarantine, and yet still hasn't made it official (that I know of).~ Colleen"
One more data point about flights. I currently have one booked for 2 weeks from now. I just found out I may need to take a quick work trip next week. The flights are completely sold out for what I need on Monday and only 2 seats left for Tuesday. We also are looking at our plan B vacation when we end up canceling Hawaii. Some of the dates I am looking at to the Destin area are sold out on some airlines and nearly full on others.
"Post #97, Same for Marathon, FL! Flights are booking up to FLL, and hotels booking up for the Key's.... which is my plan C, after cancelling 2 Maui trips, and finally throwing in the towel....I'm not afraid to fly, nor are my friends and family booking trips to North Carolina, the Caribbean and Florida! --Lori"
our flights in and out of Maui in August on Alaksa are just about full less the middle seats
"Re: ""SE, have you seen how few people want to fly anywhere? How few people think they want to be more than a few hours away from home?Those numbers aren't good either.....for Hawaii or other places.""Re: post # 92 - I think that there's a lot more demand to travel to Hawaii than people might realize. The reason why most are staying away right now is because of the state restrictions. The 2-week quarantine requirements for all visitors achieved the intended purpose.Many people would have been quite happy to have a calm, low key, relaxed vacation in Hawaii right now if you didn't have to stay indoors for 14 days upon arrival for fear of arrest, jail time, and hefty fines."
I have to agree with Arlo as well. So many people I have spoken to are dying to get back out on vacation. I’ve seen more people express an interest traveling than those who are not.
Most compromised and high risk types are not the majority of air travelers. Everyone I know (40+) recovered with no hospitalizations. I understand the greater fear in Hawaii as the resident population is older and many do not/didn't lead a healthy diet/lifestyle.
"HSA: ""Arriving visitors on Monday hit highest mark since tourism lockdowns began""https:/…"
"I agree with SW. Some flights may be full but the number of flights is greatly reduced so it is hard to judge from that how many feel comfortable flying. I had to take a flight from D.C. to Seattle and it was mostly empty. I know a high percentage of people in Michigan are reluctant to travel by car let alone get on a plane. I am optimistic that this pandemic will pass and we will get back to normal when we have a good treatment or vaccine. But with a 5 to 10% death rate I think the Governor had to make some hard decisions. Frankly I am more concerned about the future of Hawaii because of global warming raising the ocean levels and taking out the beaches and the warm water destroying the coral reefs. To solve that problem is going to take a world wide effort for many years. But again, I am optimist."
"Did I miss anything fun in #93? Airlines have reduced their routes ALL over....so yes, *some* flights are full, as Lew said. But people are not looking at the famous ""big picture"", IMO. If you doubt me, look at how many people the airlines have already retired/furloughed/bought out-and their plans to make more cuts come September-in the 30 to 40% range. Look at the plans that airlines have for ""retiring"" entire sets of equipment. They aren't doing these things because ""everyone"" wants to travel.I get that many people posting *here* want to travel, even to Hawaii :-). But my comment(s) about this are broader than the very small number here.Ige indicated he would make some official statement next week.....sometime.Edited: 9:49 pm, June 03, 2020 "
Here's some more info from the Muppet:https:/…
"“(M)y comment(s) about this are broader than the very small number here.”And my comments are broader as well. I live on the mainland, interact daily with people on the mainland, and am relaying what people here are saying and doing - first person, not merely read online. Is there still no definite extension of the quarantine from the governor? (Please stop referring to him as “the Muppet”, SW. I realize it’s not just your label, but the immature name calling serves to discredit your voice.) ~ Colleen"
"Since nobody polled me, I'd be curious to the exact questions asked about travel. As for me, I'm willing to travel, but what's the point if wherever I want to go has restrictions in place. So maybe unwillingness of travel isn't necessarily health-related.I notice my post #10 was never reinstated. Oh well."
"The State reported one new case yesterday. It is a visitor who traveled to Oahu and got sick while self quarantining.@DaytonJG: Go ahead and resubmit your post #10 from memory. I especially enjoyed it, didn't think it violated any TA T&Cs: It just infuriated the nice tourists who post on this thread about what they can do with their criticism of how we residents of Hawaii handle our affairs. : - )"
"JG, please do!Here's a link to a story I posted last night on another thread,about the ""when"" q:https:/…JG, I've seen various articles in the AP newswire, NYT, CNN, WAPO, Chicago Trib, and some other media sites/sources. The questions were all pretty much the same--whether people planned vacations this summer or fall, would they fly or drive, camp, hotel, RV, etc. RV and driving were making HUGE comebacks.I've also spoken with many friends all over the mainland and most of them don't want to fly, esp long flights. I have some friends in Colorado who are driving to FLA. next week, and others in CA who are driving to Colorado in July. Some other friends in other states are camping within a few hours or driving to East coast beaches, at times during the summer. Some have also said they want to avoid renting a car, hence another reason to drive."
"I'm with you, JG. Less and/or altered travel may well be more a reflection of practicalities than health concerns. ~ Colleen"
"I guess we are the ""others"".For our Kauai vacations that we rescheduled to Idaho (August) and Florida (November) we are flying (family of 4).Not worried one bit and can't wait.But everybody is different."
"""American Airlines Group Inc. surged the most on record after the carrier said it would boost July flights 74% compared with this month, signaling that U.S. travelers freed from shelter-in-place orders are returning more quickly than expected.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-spar…"
"""The July figure is equivalent to 40% of capacity a year earlier, compared with 30% in June""So a total of 40% compared to 30%. Not what I would call a resounding affirmation, LOL. That says 10% more people are willing to travel in July than in June.............at least, right now. And that's still 60% LESS than the same month a year ago."
"Guess I'm more of a glass-half-full kind of person -- I think it's good news that American is adding flights. It also underscores my original post, which is that there seems to be pent-up demand to travel. And as more people travel, more flights will be added.Also noted in the article, ""While traffic is still weak by historical standards, the airline’s trends suggest that the worst has passed -- and that the rebound in demand has a chance of outpacing the dire expectations the industry was outlining as recently as last month.""I'm sorry that you don't see that as anything but good news, LOL!"
"And Southwest just cut its neighbor island schedule to zero from the mainland, effective October.I get that people want things to ""go back"" to ""normal"". Really, I do. And I would LOVE to be a chirpy little wahine, only posting happy fluffy thoughts. But I've always been a realist. If news is good, I say so; when it's not, I say so!"
"Post #100 is 100% spot on. If Hawaii's quarantine were lifted flights would fill quickly. Or if folks were allowed to select their quarantine accommodations flights would fill up quickly. People are opting for destinations without quarantine restrictions or with reasonable quarantine restrictions. Ige's continued messaging about foreign tourists before Americans from the mainland, and the many comments by elected officials about Americans as ""undesirable tourists"" certainly play a part for those whose monies aren't tied up in a Hawaii rental they can't get back. They still want to travel and are willing and eager to go to other places, but mainly to places where they feel dates won't be changed, and the rug yanked from under them if they book, and they aren't being called ""mainland undesirables"" by the elected officials of places they'd be spending their money.Not every flight to every destination is full, far from it. But flights to high demand beach destinations pretty much are or are getting there. USVI reopened June 1. Once it became apparent the re-opening was actually ""real"", flights filled quickly for June and July. I'm probably going in a few weeks and flights have filled up so much I can't even easily change to a different week than the one I'm holding. Flights into Miami and south beach locations are generally full. Much of what remains available for warm beach destinations are really cruddy flights & schedules. The non-stops are mostly filled and much of what is left is 2+ connections spending many hours in airports. As much as they want to travel, people don't want to do that, and will wait until more flights come back. Airlines are adding more flights for July to meet increased demand.Of course that is a chicken-egg thing, at least for Hawaii. The majority of travelers aren't coming until the quarantine is lifted, or until they aren't forced into one of Ige's ""blessed"" hotel properties. The airlines hence won't add more flights until the quarantine is lifted.  I agree with Colleen about the driving. Although a perception of being safer driving rather than the flying is certainly a factor, I don't think it's the main one. One has much more control over what happens when driving and practicalities are easier to manage. So is adaptation to real time changes when driving rather than flying. Destinations are reflecting this also. The past two weekends, Ocean City and Virginia Beach hotels were mostly sold out. People are still wanting to travel that I see."
"It’s not a matter of being a chirpy little wahine versus being a realist. It’s not factual “news” that few people want to be more than a few hours away from home. That’s a perception, and some of us don’t share it. Doesn’t make us any less realistic or prone to fluffy posts. ~ Colleen"

"Didn’t most people at the paddle out park in a parking lot and commune of the beach before the paddle out? You all didn’t helicopter in. JK That being said, I think beaches being closed has been pretty dumb. I have been going to the beach here in Orange County for over a month. People can easily socially distance. I actually think We haven’t gotten the green for beaches to be fully open but we can loot and riot. Somehow that is a safe practice."
Beaches have been open for exercise and ocean access for months.They were opened for lounging a couple of weeks ago.

Ha! Sounds like I missed something fun. ~ Colleen
I always miss the action....
Words from the Mayor........ will it take a year or two for tourism to open? Read the very last paragraph. https:/…
"Lori, if you read most of the UHERO reports, they estimate anywhere between 1 and 5 years.....with their optimistic view being 1-2. That's for the state, not just Maui.I think the mayor kind of misstated what he meant though; people (and studies) speak in terms of tourism being back up to previous levels. So does he, normally.Again--people need to stop attacking the quarantine as the issue. It's the VIRUS. It's the economy, people worried about flying, airlines cutting waaaaaaay back, etc. etc. Those things are because of the virus-not Hawaii or anyone else's quarantine."
Yeah- I think he mis-stated what he meant....... when is the mayor and Gov up for re-election?--Lori
"Two more new cases today, on Oahu. The guv is term limited.......he is in office until 2022, heaven help us. Our mayor is up for reelection (if he runs) in 2022. This is his first term. I think he's done a very good job overall-and the new County Council (whose terms are all ending *this* November) have finally gotten some good things done too. Less infighting and posturing, IMO. Mayor Victorino has said that if we start seeing 5-7 cases often-like nearly every day-he will try to shut interisland travel back down. I'm very interested to see how this week's number go, because so far the last few days are NOT a good sign. Today's number is low, but it's Sunday and many labs don't report."
The demonstrating on Oahu yesterday won't help..... they were not social distancing....--Lori
"And as I've mentioned before, the incubation period means many cases could now come up right as or after the interisland travel starts up again :-(((((.They estimated 10,000 people rallied in Waikiki alone, yesterday."
"If you mean the rallies in Hawaii--many ""old people"" were in them, on Maui and Oahu, at least :-)."
"Ten days now since this topic was started, based on Ige’s comment that he’d extend the quarantine past June 30. Is there still no actual extension?~ Colleen"
Not yet. He said he would announce something this coming week. I'm guessing it will be Friday.....his usual drag feet thing. I'd love to be wrong and see an announcement tomorrow.
"So true, Tiki. When I was young we didn't trust anyone over 30!! Even this old bird is ready to fly!!"
"Number of cases not as important as much as to how they are affected. Any hospitalizations? Maui doesn't have the ,military spending so reliance on tourism much greater.Edited: 12:20 am, June 08, 2020 "

No one really cares.
"Post #164-- then I guess Hawaii's plan to reduce tourism will work.... if more people feel the same!--LoriEdited: 10:28 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"Yep, the trend in many places is not good. Screening is nothing more than a feel good measure to bolster the appearance of safety.The intent of testing 72 hours prior to arrival is an indirect method of reducing numbers of visitors. They are counting on many people not willing to put in that level of effort in the first place. And a negative test is not that meaningful. A lot can happen between hours 0 to 71.9.Then there is the question of those testing positive post arrival. Putting them on a plane back to where they came from does not seem like an option. The destination location will be left to care for them."
"Post #163.... I'd do this in a heartbeat, (if test is proven to be effective)...it would only make me feel more secure knowing that everyone has been tested before being allowed in, until hopefully a vaccine can be discovered...staystronghawaii...ogo"
"Basically, his plan is the same as Alaska's and many countries'. It's really not ""his"". And there are sooooo many pitfalls and issues...some like Practice mentioned.3 more people arrested:https:/…Edited: 10:52 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"we've been watching Hawaii closely, and thinking of you all. Hawaii is our favorite vacation spot, and we're still hoping to return again next summer. But it isn't about the quarantine, it absolutely is about the virus. If we still don't feel it is safe to fly 9 hours, we won't. Right now, sitting in Chicago, I can't imagine sitting on a plane for 9 hours. We even canceled our vacation for all 23 of our immediate family (and we would have traveled there in CARS), because we felt staying with so many people under one roof was too risky, even though it was a giant beach house. The local officials are doing what they think it right. we have people mocking our Governor and mayor, but we see our numbers trending downward, while they trend up across the south. Our rental house is in Michigan, people were downright violent against the Governor there, she stood her ground, and they have probably one of the sharpest declines in the county. SW thank you for being a voice of reason. you are right - it is the virus, not the quarantine. People won't return until they feel it is safe. This makes me said, but we're hoping to be back next summer."
"#170. ""it isn't about the quarantine, it absolutely is about the virus"" Right? DH and I went to Home Depot yesterday evening to purchase plants for our yard so thought being in the outdoor nursery would be all good. Unfortunately we spent most of our time dodging unmasked shoppers with zero regard for six foot distancing. Airplane travel must be a white knuckle job right now."
"Dawn, good to see you! Sorry to hear about your canceled plans, but probably a wise decision.Edited: 12:46 am, June 10, 2020 "
"Looks like HI government is still fumbling in the dark and looking for ways to minimize cases instead of manage cases. At some point, the current state of health system robustness, tax revenue losses, and increased social services costs won't be sustainable.It's clear there is neither the appetite for as rigorous a lockdown as New Zealand had in place to eliminate the virus within the community nor a desire to open things back up to the world of 2019. Something is going to have to give.I have a financial interest in seeing a way to allow tourism to resume at least at some levels; hopefully at some point the mortgage forebearance letter from First Hawaiian will finally arrive to get some relief and Maui county will treat licensed short term rentals the same as hotels (for those not attuned, there is a real possibility that your favorite hotels will be allowed to open before your favorite rental condo can), but I have to expect the multiple pressures hitting the state government are getting worse and worse. At some point there will need to be a more granular way of managing this balance than just a binary on/off for quarantines."
"Michigan Gov was ridiculous. She was just protesting the other day so shame on her. This after her husband was up at their lake house. Hawai’i is a unique situation. They do not have the medical infrastructure at the ready that we do here. That said, I hope Gov Ige opens up to tourists by Sept. My son has his honeymoon planned after being cancelled in March. They were crushed. They just want to go hang at the beach and maybe go to a few restaurants and buy some fish to grill at Star Market. We will keep our finger crossed."
"Hyatt is showing openings from July 16th--but since many rooms are cut off (the renovations), they may just be doing that more for interisland Holo Holo trips.Lynn, I did a double take at ""Star Market""........I still call it that sometimes too, even though it's been the Times for how many years, LOL!I do prefer the fish at The Fish Market to Times , too.Edited: 9:00 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"#175. We still call it Star Market, too. Heck, we still refer to Marriott Waikoloa as Royal Waikoloan!"
"LOL!kaukau posted a new thread, with the official announcement about the quarantine extension. It is to July 31st now.I guess Ige wanted people to have a good holiday tomorrow.....Kamehameha Day :-)."
KHON2 News reported tonight that the Governor is considering allowing passengers who can pre-test negative for COVID-19 to be exempt from the 14 day quarantine regulations.When or if this will be implemented is not determined.
"""KHON2 News reported tonight that the Governor is considering allowing passengers who can pre-test negative for COVID-19 to be exempt from the 14 day quarantine regulations""And of course few if anyone is going to book non-refundable flights and hotel reservations with this unknown testing outcome. Airlines and property owners/hotels would have to guarantee everything being refundable before most would roll the dice like that. I guess it would help a few such as people with vacation homes there."
I would take the test in a heartbeat. What’s the big deal? I’ve taken it twice already lol. It’s not a perfect system but testing would prevent some people from visiting and would certainly stop some people who test positive from staying. It’s a numbers game.
"kaukau, your thread has been reinstated. The servers haven't caught up with it yet.Yeah, that's part of the vaunted plan........but I think it needs to be 2 tests and even that isn't a sure thing."
Here's kaukau's thread with the official announcement:https:/…106901962
"SW, I agree. Testing after arrival would be more helpful. Our family can also wait to visit Maui in the future when things settle down."
"While *nothing* is really a sure thing, I prefer the idea of two tests. One 3 days before landing, quarantine for 3 days and a second test on what would then be day 6 since the first one. This is a method that has been discussed a lot. The proponents say it's a good 'catch' for more asymptomatic carriers and people coming into the disease. The 3 days quarantine would then end for anyone who tested negative twice. But if someone tests positive in Test #2, they would have to quarantine for 2 weeks.Edited: 12:38 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"SW, if that testing plan existed it would definitely make me feel like I can get on the plane safely. As of now, I'm avoiding flying for the foreseeable future. It's too bad that local and federal agencies can't come up with a plan and collaborate. Maybe then, we can keep our population safe and give our economy a fighting chance to recover."
"2 tests sounds great until you have to pay out of pocket twice for it. So for our family of 4, that would be $960 at $120 a pop at CVS Pharmacy. That is so not worth it."
"SW said;""While *nothing* is really a sure thing, I prefer the idea of two tests. One 3 days before landing, quarantine for 3 days and a second test on what would then be day 6 since the first one.""As a traveler, I am not opposed to this, Just that it needs to be overall better defined..""3 days before landing"" - Because there are inconsistencies and doubts towards not every traveler being able to get their pre-travel results within this timeframe, how would this work? Many travelers could be arriving with nothing to show (didnt take a pre-travel test) and unable to be differentiated between the traveler who did take the pre-travel test but did not receive their results by the time they departed on their flight.""quarantine for 3 days"" - Again, whats the difference here between a traveler who did get a pre-travel test and one that didn't? The one that did take a pre-travel is treated equally as one that didn't. I think you'd want your tourism travelers to be on board with the safety measures. Give them incentive to be health conscious.""a second test on what would then be day 6 since the first one' - falls again to the question of what happens if you don't get your results back within 3 days of landing and the expected end of the quarantine? Is Hawaii going to offer these Quick Tests at the airport?Just my mind flow towards the subject at the moment ;0)"
"There's the rub, a whole lotta questions and suppositions that at this point no one has answers for. Might as well get that top out and spin it. Dust off the crystal ball. Works just as well!!"
"Craig, most of your questions are some of the ones many people have been asking--and most haven't gotten a *solid* answer yet.Ref the pre-test---there are 2 schools of thought. First, if you don't have it you don't fly. Second, if you don't have it you fly but quarantine for two weeks.Alaska's new procedures are pretty well outlined here:https:/…and have some good info about **their** policies. I'm linking it because Hawaii is considering many identical procedures."
"Re post 186;Sincere question...As far as cost goes, isn't the CARES act supposed to be covering the costs of these tests? Every state was given lots of money to cover various issues surrounding the pandemic. That included testing, contract tracing and PPE. Shouldn't this funding (both from your departing state and Hawaii itself) cover these costs?"
"Here's a rub: The CVS COVID website, while stating that insurance will cover the full cost - you pay $0, also states that you must be a legal resident of the state in which you are being tested. Test results available in 2 - 4 days.Hmmm. So if we take a trip to Las Vegas, we can't get a test there to present when we return home to Hawaii?This is all getting so surreal!"
Kau Kau.......... lol! --Lori
"If you read Alaska's info, Alaska pays for tests *there*. I would expect Hawaii to do the same.......if this comes to fruition.With 17 more new cases on Oahu today I'd rather they were reversing themselves on the interisland travel NOW."
Wait - What? 17 new cases TODAY.?? And 15 yesterday??? Auwe! It just gets worse. : - (
"Yep, and 2 of the ones today required hospitalization :-(."
