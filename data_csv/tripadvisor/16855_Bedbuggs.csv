"Are bedbuggs a problem in many Amstedam hotels, had a nasty experience earlyer this month and will be in Amsterdam again next month and am a bit terrified to go again, was I just unlucky or is it a common problem"
I don't think there is a bedbug epidemic in Amsterdam...!!!!!
Which hotel?
You mean in which Hotel they bite me ? I know this is not a fun topic but serious for me
"Yes, please. Name that hotel.I have a guaranteed spray I can travel with that kills bedbugs and their larvae & nymphs. I always peal back the bedding to inspect the seams of the mattress for excrement. Worse than being bitten is bringing them home with you. A home infestation is very difficult to remedy. The building must be tented and heated to 125F+ for over 24-30 hrs to kill all and is very expensive. Sunny"
It was in Hotel Cornelisz nasty experience
Thanks.Over the years I have read of a couple of bedbug complaints. I doubt they are any more common in Amsterdam than most other places unless you stay in a dump.You did not stay in a dump based on the 3 stars. So maybe just bad luck?
A little surfing on the internet says so bedbugs.net/top-5-exotic-holiday-destinationâ€¦
"We still do not get many in the way of bedbug complaints here on this very popular and busy travel site. It could be well over a year maybe much longer since anyone has had a similar complaint to yours.I am going to guess the better hotels in Amsterdam are no worse off than other better hotels elsewhere,Otherwise we would hear the complaints here.There are a lot of cheap stoner type hotels in Amsterdam. They do not tend to be a popular option here., if I were looking for lots of bed bugs I'd start at one of those places.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Im not looking for them Im almost terrified thinking of them, as I have to go to Amsterdam next month staying in a hotel I think its okay to ask, dont you. I will be staying in a ""look nice"" hotel in Rembrantsplein, but the other one looked nice to... Im allergic to the bites and was under medical care when I got home, so Im worried"
"What ""look nice"" hotel did you pick for this trip?When we recommend hotels here we don't hear bedbug complaints after-----knock on wood as they say."
I will be staying in Eden Hotel Hampshire
You should be fine there. Let us know if that is not the case.
