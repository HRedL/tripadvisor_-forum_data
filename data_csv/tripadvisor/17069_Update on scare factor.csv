"We are considering plans for Spring. What is the current tone re: swine flu, narco related issues, etc. that we tourists would be concerned about? "
You would have more worries travelling to Chicago than you would to Puerto Vallarta. Only 6am here and already I need a Sol!
"Zero concerns at present, no telling what 'scare' your media will come up with for the spring ?"
"There's nothing to ""update"". Because these things were never a factor to the average tourist visiting Puerto Vallarta."
"there are little concerns that come up, but they tend to be dealt with nicely, and are often overblown by the time you hear about them. no matter where you are doing business, the transactions you make using a credit card and debit card may be compromised. i would suggest you use atm machines with caution and take a credit card with a low limit for travel, combine that with online banking to keep track and your mind will be at rest. that is standard at home and abroad. with pv being a big tourist town, security is a higher priority. people feel safe in pv. time share business is big, so that can be an annoyance. some people dont like the vendors on the beach, but they are polite when you tell them no thank you. as to the current virus and possible other plagues yes possible anything can happen but i havent a definitive answer for you. check back next spring."
I agree with JR. I'm here now. Nothing to be concerned about at the moment. 
Spring fever will probably be at epidemic levels. People everywhere having a fantastic time! I'd stay away. lmao
"We were in PV during the height of the ""swine flu"", Apr 20 to May 3. As a precaution, they closed the clubs for a week. No cases were ever reported in PV. Got back to Chicago to hear of several deaths here in Illinois blamed on the flu. "" Narco related isuues"" are on the border. Again nothing in PV. Upon returning home, I saw fall prices really drop so by mid May, I had booked my return to PV for the end of October. As things have calmed down, prices have now started to go up again.Go and enjoy.Now I think I'll have a margarita."
"Yup, us too (19 April to 20 May). The so-called ""news"" (especially tv) here lately has been speculating on what 'might/could' happen re: the HINI flu this fall. Wish they would just stick with news!! But guess it's easier and cheaper for kost media to just speculate, than research and report on 'real' news!!We're drinking some 'red', toasting, and looking forward to our fall trip!! (and tuning out the so-called ""news"" on the tube!!!) "
"Unless you are immune compromised you will be safe where ever you live. It is the flu nothing more, the only difference is they do not have an antibody as of yet. The media has put a huge scare into people over this, I work in healthcare and have seen the H1N1 close up and I have not seen a healthy person suffer the really bad effects the older and younger (Baby) set has. So have a great time and be vigilant.......This is my opinion on the subject and I believe it is an informed one."
"Just got back from PV and i've never felt safer - stayed in a villa on Amapas across from Blue Chairs & Blue Sea Hotel near Los Muertos - one night, there was apparently an attempted robbery of a house that is behind the Blue Sea & directly in front of our villa - no worries - we were in our pool looking down and the police were there & arrested the perps & took them away handcuffed in a pick-up - i never felt safer in my life - as far as swine flu, the only precautions we took were to carry hand sanitizer wipes and purell so that when we wanted to eat (especially tacos from street stands - the best!!), we were able to ""sterilize our hands"" and feel safe - never had any problem whatsoever - people are way too paranoid about all the rumors and whatnot - go and enjoy!!"
"Thank you, everyone, for the vote of confidence for PV. It's always good to be reassured. "
Holakis- I feel way safer in PV than I do on State Street. Go have a great time. I am already counting the days down until the next trip and cant wait no matter what our TV tries to stir up.
"We got back from a week in PV on 1 August. The town was calm, (quiet) lots of police and army around which is reassuring.As usual, the biggest issue was not getting time to do all the things we wanted to, and eat at all the places we had decided to hit. Advice? Don't plan too many things that might get in the way of just chilling out at the beach.Enjoy! "
"Welcome back Claymore, look forward to your trip report."
