"Skittish about buying a nonrefundable plane ticket given the growing travel fallout from the coronavirus epidemic? American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and other carriers, worried about soft ticket sales, are taking the unprecedented step of broadly waiving those hefty ticket change and cancellation fees for new ticket purchases.JetBlue started the trend last week because of ""evolving coronavirus concerns'' and was quickly joined by Alaska Airlines, which calls it a ""peace of mind'' waiver.American was the first of the big three U.S. airlines to announce a fee waiver, on Sunday.On Monday, Delta joined the club, but with a twist: its fee-free waiver only applies to international flights while the other carriers' policies include those flights and flights within the United States.article from USA Today.I'm sure further info forthcoming.Edited: 9:57 am, March 04, 2020 "
"USA Today article continues.....There is fine print, of course. The biggest, in all the change-fee waivers to date: you can't buy a nonrefundable ticket under this policy and request a refund if your plans change or you don't want to travel. You can change or cancel the ticket for free. If you cancel, you'll receive credit for a future flight.An airline-by-airline look:American Airlines: American's waiver allows travelers who purchase tickets between March 1 and March 16 to change or cancel them without paying fees that start at $200 per person. The new policy covers tickets purchased for travel through late January 2021. On American, the fee will be waived for changes made up to 14 days prior to travel. So if you buy a ticket for a summer trip and need to change it for lingering coronavirus concerns or any reason, you just have to change it at least two weeks before departure to avoid the fee. Fare differences will apply: If you nab a $250round-trip ticket from Chicago to Orlando and the going rate is $400 when you change the ticket to another date, you'll pay an extra $150Edited: 10:01 am, March 04, 2020 "
Too complicated for me. I just fly Southwest and don't worry about it.
"Amen brother. I'm with you concerning S.W. I'll stick with them, no matter what."
"per todays NYT.....Stocks of the gambling companies Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are already each down more than 20 percent this year, largely owing to the closure of their enormous casino operations in Macau for two weeks.Las Vegas lost its first big conference late Monday when Adobe Systems canceled its annual event that was going to bring 20,000 visitors to hear headline speakers like the actress and entrepreneur Gwyneth Paltrow, the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and the comedian Chelsea Handler, along with chief executives and top officials from numerous companies. Adobe said it planned to host portions of the event online.“Vegas is the biggest unknown right now,” said Steven Wieczynski, a gambling and leisure analyst at the financial services firm Stifel Financial. “If the coronavirus continues to linger and stays in the news, more conventions and group trips will get canceled. That’s what Vegas is known for right now.”"
KLM/Air France/Delta sent an mailshot out today where they have offered rebooking on all flights currently booked up to 31st March to be able to be rebooked for travel dates valid until the end of May. To use the facility one still has to pay the rebooking fee and whatever the difference in the cost of the flight. If one doesn’t want to travel at all before the end of May they’re offering a refund in the form of a voucher. An awful lot of businesses here in Europe have grounded their staff for business travel.
"I avoid SWA when I can but there is 1 and only 1 thing I like about SWA and its their change policy. I continue to book my preferred carriers for when I need to travel and dont worry about it. If CV gets so out of hand that I cant get on a flight, the airlines will allow changes. I flew United last week, United this week and American next week.Edited: 5:06 pm, March 04, 2020 "
