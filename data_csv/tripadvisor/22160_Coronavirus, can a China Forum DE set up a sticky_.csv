The China forum and sub forums are drowning in posts about the coronavirus and whether someone should cancel the trip or not.Maybe a DE can set up a sticky to serve as the clearinghouse for all things Coronavirus.
"Maybe no need, let people ask. Let hundred flowers blossom, let hundred birds sing, as Chairman Mao said. Situation changes rapid, numbers kept on climbing, what was unthinkable became routine. It will get a lot worse before it gets better.Info I got from a friend living in Sichuan is far worse and thus far unreported, but best not to say anything to avoid being attacked online. Done people still try to sugarcoat it.I personally think they should quarantine China as a whole. Every traveler from or through China should be tested or quarantined for 2 weeks, or ban all China flights out. Temperature check is not working.Edited: 12:02 pm, January 25, 2020 "
"HK protest? What protest? I don’t remember anything about HK riots, do you? New virus subjects killed HK riots, kicked the can into the alley."
"@MacHave you, at least for a minute, compared the current Coronavirus with every year's influenza outbreak worldwide?Have you, at least as far as reputable information is available, compared death rates, speed of transmission, ratio of transmission and length of transmission chains with the annual influenza onslaught?Or do you just want to provoke?"
"David Rosenthal, director of Harvard University Health Services, said, ""People don't necessarily die, per se, of the [flu] virus—the viraemia. What they die of is a secondary pneumonia. So many of these pneumonias are not viral pneumonias but secondary [pneumonias]."" But Dr Rosenthal agreed that the flu/pneumonia relationship was not unique. For instance, a recent study (JAMA 2004;292: 1955-60[Abstract/Free Full Text]) found that stomach acid suppressing drugs are associated with a higher risk of community acquired pneumonia, but such drugs and pneumonia are not compiled as a single statistic. CDC states that the historic 1968-9 ""Hong Kong flu"" pandemic killed 34 000 Americans. At the same time, CDC claims 36 000 Americans annually die from flu. What is going on?"
"This is a very long CDC report, google search and read it yourself. Copy paste is just a tiny exerts from that CDC report."
"There has never been a DE for the ""China"" forum as far as I can remember. China is so huge and diverse, these are big shoes to fill."
"I received same notice from multiple suppliers and contacts in China within the last hours: STAY HOME FOR 2 WEEKS. It is a nationwide call to all citizens to stay home for 2 weeks, don’t see anybody, don’t go anywhere. They can get it under control if the entire nation just stay home for 2 weeks. Makes sense, 2 weeks is the Incubation period for Wuhan Coronavirus."
"Shantou Guangdong will go into quarantine midnight 1/27, reverse quarantine, no one is allow to enter. US, France and Russia will evacuate all staff and citizens from Wuhan, by air, by land.Edited: 1:39 am, January 26, 2020 "
