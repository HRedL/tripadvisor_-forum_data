According to this website! https:/…
"Borders will be opened however, a seven-day mandatory quarantine in a hotel at your own expense and an additional seven days under strict health monitoring.The commission also decided to allow inter-city travel starting June 4. Shops, café, restaurants, and mosques will re-open on June 4."
There is no regulation in place -yet- for time from 27th June on.
"I planned to travel from Italy by boat on the 27th arrival on the 28th. Have no problem with the quarantine but nowhere I can find information on where to book a hotel for this quarantine. Calls to different agencies, consulate/embassy , no one can direct my to the online website.very frustrating situation. Changing my booking with CTN is not allowed neither.Help what can I do?"

ElkeAre you sure the boat will sail. Untill now there is no decision yet about opening of borders between Europe and non European countries
"Unless you are a tunisian, please note that there seems to be No OPTION to visit Tunisia individually for the time being.The rules für visiting Tunisia from the 27th on stipulate that you HAVE to take a hotel bus to the hotel and that you HAVE to stay on hotel premises during your stay. You only can leave the premises on a guided group tour.As a reaction to such rules, the tunisian hotel federation has declared that there won't be a tourist season this year in Tunisia and a large part of the hotels will remain closed. They recommend that the government shall update the rules or close the borders to Tunisia again.Edited: 8:01 am, June 15, 2020 "
"Starting 27th June, there will be a 3-group-system come into effect. Depending on the residence country, every person will be put into one of the 3 groups. Each group has different conditions of entering and staying in Tunisia.There will be more information published in the next days, especially, which residence country belongs to which group. Unless one comes from a risk country (groups orange and red), individual travel will be possible as well."
"The Tunisian authorities have advised that from 27 June entry requirements will vary depending on the prevalence of the epidemic in travelers’ country of residence. The UK has been classified as a “Red” country.This means that individuals resident in the UK are not permitted to enter Tunisia. The only exceptions to this are for Tunisian nationals and for those with residency in Tunisia. These individuals can travel from the UK to Tunisia subject to:Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you; andSpending seven days in quarantine then an additional seven days in confinement at home, subject to a negative COVID-19 test; andSigning a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules."
"The classifications for entry or no entry purposes, Red, Orange and Green ,will be reviewed weekly  I have, of course,quoted the situation currently for visitors from the UK. Posters/viewers on here from other Countries looking for updates/advice should check their own Govts line on the matter of entry to Tunisia.Edited: 6:53 am, June 26, 2020 "
Thanks mick will stop looking at holidays for August now and just book for next year fingers crossed
"Pity you did not get your Tunisian holiday this year,Nichola I doubt many from the UK will this season/year."
"Hello. TUI seem to be selling holidays to Tunisia from 1st September onwards so I can only assume their hope is things will have calmed by then hence cancelling July and August travel. I booked, in December, a holiday to Tunisia for October and really hope it is safe to travel by then. Hope everyone is keeping safe and well."
"The UK has now been classified as Orange in the traffic light system Following from UK govt websiteThe UK has been now been classified as an “Orange” country.While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice against all non-essential international travel for British nationals remains in place.............. Tunisian authorities now permit individuals resident in the UK to travel to Tunisia, subject to:Having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative no more than 72 hours before departure and bringing evidence of this result with you;Self-isolating in your place of residence or a hotel at your own expense for 14 days. If you wish to leave self-isolation, you may do so from the sixth day after your arrival, by paying for a PCR test and receiving a negative result; andSigning a declaration to confirm that you will abide by these rules.Edited: 8:31 am, July 03, 2020 "

"Colour coding for travel to Tunisia from the UK is now ‘GREEN’ so one can now enter without Quarantine on arrival however, Quarantine on return to the UK us still in place.Philipa"
"The Tunisian authorities have classified the UK as a “Green” country. Tunisian authorities now permit individuals resident in the UK to travel to Tunisia, with no requirement to take a test before departing or self-isolate on arrival.However....The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice against all non-essential travel for British nationals remains in place. That will impact on insurance Charter holiday flights wont resume until ""non essential travel "" is eased to allow Tui and others to resume Hopefully that is soon"
"If you do travel to Tunisia, however, you will have to self-isolate for fourteen days on arrival home, and provide your journey and contact details.if you do go to Tunisia there are no restrictions on travel to and from airports and ports, and all modes of public transport (taxis, buses, trains and others) are permitted to operate at full capacity.Wearing a face mask in public places is mandatory.It is worth noting too that Tunisian authorities have implemented localised lockdowns in response to the detection of infection clusters, so if you are subject to a localised lockdown, follow the instructions of the authorities.Hotels and private rentals are available to book, although hotels are required to operate at 50% of their capacity.Hygiene measures are in place, including luggage disinfection on arrival, temperature checks on entry and hand sanitiser in public spaces. Tourists must wear face masks on the transport to their accommodation and self-service restaurants are not allowed to operate as normal; food must be served to guests while they are seated.Cafes, restaurants, bars and places of worship are permitted to operate at 70% of normal capacity."
Glad we rebooked for next May and not this year .. hopefully things will be a bit more normal by then x Pauline x
"A question about in-transit airports.I've tried to get an answer from both Royal Air Moroc and Tunis Air. Neither are returning emails.One of the two routes I am looking into to get from Canada to Tunisia is via Royal Air Moroc to Casablanca, then transfer to Tunis Air and continue on to Tunis. Montreal to Tunis is a lot cheaper than Flying Canada to Europe to Tunisia'My question is in regards to my stopover. For now, Tunisia has Morocco is listed as an orange country. I have to transfer terminals, so I have been emailing both airlines asking if I would then have to do a 14 day quarantine in Tunisia. The Tunisian Consulate in Montreal was of no use. I was hoping somebody may have arrived in Tunis via Casablanca lately.Thanks;BrianEdited: 2:52 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"FCO Update Change to rules before entering Tunisia from the UKTest 72 hours before departure and self-isolation on arrival in Tunisia See ""Entry Requirements"" for Tunisia on FCO website for more details"
The next update is apparently in 3 weeks which coincides with the first flights operated by TUI etc to Tunisia from the UK. They seem to be putting a lot of hope on things changing to allow this “quarantine free” holidays that they promise. We’re due mid October but if it’s still on the basis of the UK being Orange we won’t be going.
"Friends booked with TUI for September have already been told their holidays cancelled, L8w. They already have refunded amounts back to their bank accounts. easyJet recently cancelled their Sept/October flights so dont really see any holidays for this year."
Thanks for letting me know. Let’s hope TUI don’t drag their heels and just cancel sooner than later. Stay safe
"@ BrianUnless you are booked on one ticket with your luggage booked direct to your final destination. I do not think you will even be allowed to board your flight to Casablanca, even if you have the required negative PCR test results that are less then 48 hours from when you fly. You surely will not be allowed to exit to collect your luggage in Casablanca as the country is not yet opened to tourism. I would avoid this routing as it could cost you for a flight you would be refused boarding."
