"Hi, May i check how is the measles outbreak situation in bangkok?"
"Is there an outbreak in Bangkok? Many countries (e.g. Germany, Italy, U.K.) were mentioned in today's paper, not Bangkok from what I recall."
I’m also trying to research on this..any negative findings?
Rather worry about measles in SIN. And def. don't travel to continental Europe. No epidemic in BKK.
how the outbreak measles in bangkok is it compulsory to have the vaccination before going to bangkok
"The outbreak in Thailand is mostly in the extreme south, and apparently the Muzzys aren't big on vaccinations. Sadly, it's a fairly bad outbreak.Oh well .... Som nam na"
"Any updates on the situation? My elderly parents are travelling to Bangkok next month, not sure if their vaccinations are up to date or whether they can still be vaccinated due to their age. And they help take care of babies in my family, which is a concern too."
99% of people over 40 got measles as a kid so no need for vaccine and getting measles boosts your protection more than a vaccine. They are less of a threat than you to your kids.Vaccines dont provide 100% coverage.Edited: 1 year ago 
"# 6 Measles would be one of my least concerns. Chance of contracting Dengue Fever much higher, though unless a poor immune system, wouldn't worry much about that either. Elderly (what age is your version) and younger children seem to have problems with DF."
Flus kill more people than many other things.
"Flu, depending how your read the stats. Part of (most) of number 4 killer (respiratory) in the USA, and definitely a solid position at #8 by itself.Right there with people offing themselves and opioid ODs ..... 555Measles .... please"
"So basically they can be carriers, but not be affected (am I right?) and therefore transmit the measles virus back to babies at home?My question still stands, is it an epidemic like in the south, where it was heavily reported in November?"
Take your kids to the doctor and ask for vaccine advice.No need to be paranoid about measles.
"""is it an epidemic like in the south""How many deaths were there?"
"""He notes that people without measles symptoms cannot act as ""carriers"" to silently spread the virus. If people don't have measles symptoms, such as a cough, fever or rash, they can't spread the virus to others, Wallace says.""https:/…Sounds like people who had it before cant spread it around.Edited: 1 year ago "
"@# 11 ... since Malaysia, and Kuala Lampur has failed to hit it's deadline (2010) of irradiating measles there, simply take the same precautions, or lack of, that you've taken already in your home country.Where it seems to be more of a problem, since having twice as many deaths in 2017 per 100k residents. Get vaccinated or stay home, in a higher risk area.Edited: 1 year ago "
#15 lol
"Should have stated.....PLEASE stay home, since outbreak is in provinces along the Malay border .... 555Keep the sh*t in your own country.....555"
"""irradiating measles""???Guess spell checker played tricks."
Glow in the dark measles
"in the South ""Health authorities are racing to contain a measles outbreak in the country's southern provinces, where 14 deaths and more than 1,500 cases have been reported since September.""There has also been a lot of flu.Look - if you are traveling to ANY foreign country you need to make sure your vaccines ae up to date regardless of your destination - vaccines may last for years - but with things like flu you need to be up to date.The current flu in the South is Type A and possibly some others..."
Damn you spell checker......555Glowing dots.....cool.....off to the FMP
"There is an outbreak of measles in couple of Southern Province next to Malaysia.The cause is the lack of vaccinations of children due to the vaccine having traces of pig.Not sure why only in south Thailand and not in Malaysia.Apparently, depending on who one believes the vaccinations are illegal under Islamic law.Obviously, some think modern medical practice is not for them or there children.Unfortunately, it endangers their children and all new born babies under 3 months as they are too young to be vaccinated."
Jews don't eat pork (muslims copied them) and they get vaccines. Southern Thailand has some rather backward people.Edited: 1 year ago 
"there is no pork gelatin in the vaccines ... but like in Europe people listen to those trying to knock vaccines.The problem is not just their children and babies, if vaccinations go below a certain level then whole communities lose their ""herd immunity"" - which then results in large outbreaks."

Vaccine used in UMMR vaccine is for measles and contains porkhttps:/…
"""However, many faith group leaders have stated the use of gelatine in vaccines is acceptable and doesn't break any religious rules.""Only an idiot would avoid pork anyway."
bacon ...
Priorix® MMR vaccine does not contain gelatine and is as safe and effectiveEdited: 1 year ago
