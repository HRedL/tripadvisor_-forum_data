"Hello TA family!It's been awhile since I have had the pleasure of planning a trip. Now, with COVID, I hope that my efforts will not be wasted! If you wouldn't mind taking a look at the following, I would appreciate some guidance on a potential itinerary for March 2021.This will be our 2nd trip to NZ. We will have approximately 25 days. We like to spend time hiking, wine tasting, visiting hot springs, and taking in beautiful sites! NZ tops our list to date of a perfect fit! Last trip, we missed Northland all together. We hit some high points on both the N and S island. We loved Mt Cook, Abel Tasman, and Wanaka.This time, our sample itinerary looks like this:Day 1: Arrive Auckland, overnight Whangarei3 nights Northland: Explore (would Opononi be a good base for exploring and visiting Waipoua Forest, Kerikeri, Cape Reinga, etc.?)2 nights: Coromandel Peninsula (Whitianga)1 night: New Plymouth2 nights: Martinborough2 nights: Nelson (do a day walk on Queen Charlotte Track)3 nights: Takaka1 night: Lake Matheson3 nights: Wanaka2 nights: Glenorchy3 nights: Mt Cook1 night Christchurch (depart)We are open to critique and suggestion! Still in early planning stages, but when the COVID restrictions lift here (soon!), I will be back to work, with limited time to plan.Thank you much, in advance!TerryCocoa Beach, FL USA"
"I hope your travel plans come to fruition. I'd much rather discuss itineraries than the woes of Covid-19. But I will have to inform you that New Zealand is going to be extremely strict with border re-opening, even to the extreme it won't be until a vaccine is found. But let's discuss issues and questions with your proposed itinerary.Day 1 is going to be a concern with the locals. They don't want you getting into a car and driving for almost 3 hours to Whangarei after getting off a long-haul flight. The fix would be to get a connecting flight. I also think Kerikeri would be a better base for your Northland plans. So get that connecting flight to KKE instead.Then you have a problem of the long drive from Kerikeri to Whitianga, and that should probably be broken up.Why one night New Plymouth? A long way to go and no time to spend there. Martinborough for the wines, I presume? Why not Napier, which would set you up nicely with it's proximity to an airport to fly to South Island. And with your interest in hot springs, why no time in Rotorua?  I'm not understanding your 2 nights at Nelson for a daywalk Queen Charlotte Track - did you mean Abel Tasman Track? Or if wanting to do QCT, why not stay those 2 nights Picton? Or better yet, someplace on the track?Takaka to Lake Matheson (Fox Glacier) is WAY to far for a 1-day drive.Let's discuss your priorities and make this a better trip."
"Kia ora,great to see someone planning a trip.First and most important - please do not pick a car up on arrival - go to a hotel and have a good rest first.Northland is fantastic in March - the beaches on the East side are great for swimming and there are superb snorkelling opportunities eg Goat Island and Poor Knights.I would first head up to the Matakana/Leigh/Goat Island area for 2NBay of Islands on the way to Doubtless Bay for 2N Hokianga/Opononi for 2N.Then down to Auckland or a bit further to Raglan 2N (although Raglan is a 6hr drive from Opononi but can be done if you are comfortable with that length of drive on the left side of the road and take it steady, have breaks etc) Rotorua 2N (if you haven't been)Napier 2NWellington 2Nthen over to the South either by car or fly down to Queenstown.Having done a good tour of Northland, I would omit the Coromandel.Happy planning!Edited: 6:56 pm, April 19, 2020 "

"It would really help if you numbered you days so we can refer to them specifically!Unlike the above posters, I'm going to assume that you are flying to Whangarei on Day 1. But I question why? It would be better to fly to Kerikeri, the Bay of Islands airport, where it would be easier to pick up a rental car. Strangely I don't see BoI in your itinerary at all!Yes, you have too many long drives & Days 7 & 8 are silly - all day driving, zig-zagging across the country and no time to stop & see/do anything!Day 14? is way too long. Even 2 full days with a night at Punakaiki or Westport/Cape Foulwind/Carters Beach would be 2 very long days. You have 560Km, when we recommend an average of 250Km per day with an occasional exception of up to 350 followed by a 2N stay.I suggest you modify GTS's itinerary - cutting Golden Bay seems necessary, but I'd also cut New Plymouth & knock a night off Aoraki Mt Cook. You might want to choose between QCT & ATNP to free up another 2N for Wanaka & Glenorchy."
"First, many thanks deSchenke, marek p, and greytraveller for your input!I will add the details, I left out. First, I was considering the first two nights, we would visit the Cook Islands, and get some R&R at Aitutaki? Figuring that would get us nicely settled into the proper time zone. That was my rationale for driving the 3 hours north on Day 1. Also, we typically like to stay at least 2N in any given location, because we tend to arrive late (packing our days full) and we are slow to start in the morning.I will look at Kerikeri/Paihai/Doubtless Bay as possible base camp options for exploring Northland. And, I also like the idea of a couple of days in the Opononi area. I was making the stop over in Whangeri to check out the snorkeling options in the area, as marek p has suggested. (But, this could be eliminated, if we have had some snorkeling in the Cook Is.) That being said, we could possibly drive straight to Kerikeri, thus giving ourselves more time up there? Or, we could skip the Cook Is, and spend the extra couple of nights in Northland? So many options!!The reason I included the Coromandel was because we missed it last time. However, if we are able to hit some hot springs in Northland, possible we could skip this as also suggested by marek p.The New Plymouth/Raglan route was, as above, because we ""missed it"" last time. It was included as a ""scenic drive"", with stops as the itinerary matures. Is Raglan a better 2N option than the 1N at New Plymouth?Last visit, traveling S-N, we breezed through Martinborough from Blenheim on our way to Napier (loooong day!) We visited some great wineries in Napier, but our motel was less than ideal. So, we thought we would sample wines in Martinborough this trip. But, again, we are open to some fine tuning.Rotorua--just not a lot of interest in that area. I like the idea of staying on the QCT, and will look into some options for that, over the Nelson 2N stay. We were hoping to explore ATNP from the Takaka side. We visited the Fox/Franz glacier area on our last trip, so the stopover in Lk Matheson, was just to give us a place to lay our heads. Maybe we will stop at Hokitika instead? Is Glenorchy a doable day trip from Wanaka? Is it preferred to do it that way? Or spend the night there? If I remember, the trip from Wanaka to Mt Cook was a pleasant day.One oversight on my part....we have not done the drive from Picton to Kaikoura. Would love to fit that in also! Thanks for the help in planning our trip. NZ is doing a great job at keeping their people well. We sure hope this COVID thing is under control in a year! Not sure we want to be quarantined for 14 days at the beginning of our trip! It would eliminate SO many options!!!"
"You have had plenty of suggestions to look at but regarding Aitutaki - we had some absolutely stunning snorkelling there as well as at Rorotonga but given you want to visit Northland as well as the South Island of NZ I think in 25 days it would be too much. We had some fantastic times snorkelling at Goat Island and always wanted to go to Poor Knights but have not managed to, yet.If you go to Napier, have a look at staying at either the Masonic Hotel or Scenic Te Pania and you can do a bus or cycle tour of vineyards."
"Zhuhai, thanks for your input. We are only beginning to plan, so I appreciate your insights, especially into the long travel days!If we eliminate Coromandel, that gives us a few extra days to split up either between the Northland, the W coast of the N Is, or to use in the S Is/Wanaka region?Here are some day numbers that can be played around with....:Day 1: Arrive Auckland from Cook Islands drive to Northland (3-4N)Day 2: Explore Northland/BOIDay 3: Explore Northland/BOIDay 4: Explore Northland/Waipoua Forest regionDay 5: Drive to either Coromandel or Raglan? (2-3N)Day 6: Explore N Isl (Coromandel or W Coast)Day 7: Martinborough (2N)Day 8:MartinboroughDay 9: Picton/Nelson (2N)Day 10:QCTDay 11: Drive to Takaka (3N)Day 12: ATNPDay 13: ATNPDay 14: Drive to Hokitika (1N)Day 15: Drive to Wanaka (3N)Day 16: WanakaDay 17: GlenorchyDay 18: Drive to Mt Cook (3N)Day 19: Mt CookDay 20: Mt CookDay 21: Drive to Chch (1N)Day 22Day 23Day 24Day 25:DepartThanks in advance for the fine tuning advice!!T in FL"
Ok if the Cooks are extra to your 25 days then go for it if you can - they are beautiful.
"Day 14: Drive to Hokitika (1N)Day 15: Drive to Wanaka (3N)There is so much to see on the drive to Wanaka so a stay at Fox glacier is required so you can see reflections at .lake matheson at it's best which is normally early morning when there is no wind.here are some points of interestLake Moeraki, Knights Point Lookout, Ship Creek, Haast Bridge and Rapids, Roaring Billy Falls, Pleasant Flats, Fantail Falls, Thunder Creek Falls, Blue Pools walk , Makarora, Lake HaweaDay 1: Arrive Auckland from Cook Islands drive to Northland (3N)Day 2: Explore Northland/BOIDay 3: Explore Northland/BOIDay 4:Drive to OrewaDay 5: Drive to either Coromandel area (Hahai) (2NDay 6 Explore HWB and Cathedral CoveDay 7 Drive to RaglanDay 8 Drive to New PlymouthDay 9 Drive to Martinborough (2N)Day 10: MartinboroughDay 11 Drive to Wellington afternoon ferry to Picton (2N)Day 12: QCTDay 13: Drive to Marahau (easier access to ATNP.

"Good to see you planning your 2nd trip to NZ next March, the place I just visited 1st time this March.Amidst people thinking negatively, people with positive outlook and looking towards a new day ahead is contagious in bringing joy and hope in others.For your itineraries, I am not at all qualified to comment as our interests & itineraries are so diverse. As such a first timer has hardly any right to comment.Having said that, being in medical field, I would comment only on the timing of the trip, as has been rightly warned by deShenke. Plan now, but earliest for March 2022, instead of March 2021. Or has been said time and again - Book only those things that are 100% refundable. Points to note regarding current scenario:1) How long the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic may last? Look at the past Corona outbreaks. 1st SARS-CoV lasted for almost 3 years from Jan 2002 to Dec 2004. MERS started in 2012, though not relevant much now, was a threat till 2016. And both these Corona diseases were not even declared Pandemics. 2) It can have multiple peaks, till say 60% population is affected ( or vaccinated) and then the communuty has developed herd immunity {considering reproductivity rate -R0 (R-naught) to be 2.5}.3) Winter is supposed to be conducive for its transmission. Till 2nd winter season in all countries is over, the pandemic status might not be declared as over.4) Preparation of Covid 19 vaccine will take time. Phase I clinical trial may take 2 to 3 months, but a vaccine deemed deployable for billions of people with rigorous Phase II & III trials will make it impossible to make it available before August 2021. Then there will be the issues of production capacity and then time taken for schedule of vaccine for immunity development - Ideally 0,1 & 6 months (lucky if 0 & 1 month) interval for vaccinations to provide immunity. So, may you get vicarious joy of planning now, but act only later.Best wishes."
"From your revised itinerary on post 7: -I would still plan to fly up to Kerikeri on day 1 rather than driving. No matter how fresh you feel it's still a long and slow drive north rather than a short flight straight to where you want to be.If you're going to do the QCT you need to be in Picton, not two hours away in Nelson.Going to Golden Bay is a great idea but it doesn't make sense to drive all the way over there to be in a more inconvenient place to explore ATNP. there;s a lot tro see in Golden Bay but if your main aim is Abel Tasman then stay in Kaiteriteri or near where you have easy access to the NP and no need to go over Takaka Hill.Takaka to Hokitika is still too far in one day. Even from Kaiteriteri I wouldn't go further than Punakaiki.Equally Hokitika to Wanaka is too far. You need to build an extra day in along the west coast and even then you will have three days together of mostly driving."
Are you stopping in the Cook Islands for a few days or is it just a couple of hours stop over?If you have been in the air for a long haul flight it is beyond stupid to get out of plane and drive anywhere.
"Thanks for chiming in on our itinerary JohnEW and NZMike!The Cook Island plan was to stopover for 2 nights, so not driving anywhere after the long haul!We definitely appreciate the fine tuning that happens as we break up the long NZ drives. It’s such a beautiful place, we know that stopping is what will make the trip the most memorable! ; )Edited: 8:17 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Watch the timing of the America's Cup. It is supposed to be March 2021, might be postponed but will be in Auckland."
">>We were hoping to explore ATNP from the Takaka side.<<Takaka is great for exploring Golden Bay, but not Abel Tasman. The walk-in entrance to Abel Tasman is at Marahau, and water taxis provide service from Marahau and Kaiteriteri. Now, is it possible to visit Abel Tasman from Takaka - yes, but it will take effort. You would have to drive the unsealed and very windy road to Totaranui campground. This will take at least an hour, and it will not be a relaxing drive. You really don't want to double that distance out and back on a daytrip! And once at Totaranui, you can walk north or south on the walking track, but it too would be an out and back walk. As a whole, it wouldn't be very satisfying.Much better to get a water taxi from Marahau or Kaiteriteri and see the park from the water, be dropped off at one location and walk either out or to another water-taxi pickup point. You could do another variation of this on a second day.I still think all that driving on the west coast of North Island to New Plymouth for one night and then a long drive to Martinborough the day after is a bit much. And not much bang for your effort. The real attraction of that portion of coastline are the black sand beaches (Awakino, Mokau, Tongaporutu, and White Cliffs) at low tide. We drove that portion with 2 nights at Mokau and 2 nights New Plymouth so we could take advantage of tide times at multiple locations. You have a one-day drive through and your chances of getting a low tide at the right time and place are not great. You've left no time to do walks at Mt Taranaki since you have long drives going to and from New Plymouth. So why bother?I think you are going to have to set priorities, and some destinations will have to be cut so you can take full advantage of the places you will be visiting. Internal flights are not a bad idea to get from here to there in a timely manner. Right now you seem to want to do too much and cover a lot of ground. You really need 2 nights to have a full day to do the hiking, hot springs, snorkeling, and wine tasting that you've expressed interest in doing.Our 4th trip to NZ we did a few internal flights to visit places we had missed on our first 3 visits. It was 19 nights and covered some of the same places you mentioned. I'd never advise it for a first-time trip. But I look back on in as my favorite trip. It went like this:2 nights Whangarei Heads 1 night Whangaroa 3 nights Paihiaflight from BOI to Nelson2 nights Pohara/Takaka1 night Picton / 1 night Endeavor Inlet / 1 night Picton (water-taxi/hike QCT)Ferry to North Island2 nights Martinborough1 night WellingtonFlight to Invercargill / small plane to Stewart Island2 nights Stewart Island3 nights GlenorchyMy point being that internal flights might work for you. Although there is no telling if domestic flights will be as frequent as they once were."
"deSchenke has said more eloquently why Takaka is a poor choice to visit ATNP from. Golden Bay is great, but it needs to be an add-on to a trip to Abel Tasman. You could do it, but only at the expense of something else or of using some of those days spare you currently have at the end.I note that you don't have either Rotorua or Queenstown on your plan, which makes me think we may have very similar interests. In 3 long trips we have still not been to Rotorua or have any real interest in doing so and we've only spent one night in Queenstown where we ate in and did the washing!I think I would add on at least another day to the trip south down the west coast.I'd have a look at Okarito - a tiny place on the coast near Franz Josef. No shops or restaurants but plenty of bach accommodation, a fine eco boat trip on the Okarito lagoon which has excellent bird life including the rare white heron, the chance to kayak your selves on the lagoon, an outstanding evening kiwi spotting trip and one of the best views of the Southern Alps from the trip point above (on the rare days that you can see them!). A two night stay there or in Hokitika or one of the glacier towns will allow you to slow down and have a better look at the coast.I too can't see the point of one night in New Plymouth. Another great place, which we went to for the first time this March, but we had 4 nights there.Is there a particular reason for Martinborough? Again a good place to visit wineries, especially if you like Pinot Noir but in truth Central Otago is probably better - prettier and some of the world's best Pinot.You can of course visit lots of wineries in Marlborough right by Picton and Queen Charlotte Sound - world famous for Sauvignon Blanc although the countryside is a bit flat and boring. there is also a very good wine region between Nelson and the Abel Tasman which would be easy to visit on your plans.Like deSchenke we have made liberal use of internal flights, which can (or could) be great value if booked well in advance. For example you could easily fly from Tauranga to Nelson after Coromandel, dropping your race across the North Island and leaving time to properly explore Golden Bay. A car hire contract can be bought all as one contract but dropping one car at Tauranga and picking up another in Nelson (or any other airport combination)."
"Some might describe Queenstown and Rotorua as ""touristy"" but there is a reason for that. Both are iconic and would provide a contrast to other places on your list."
In truth Mike the OP might have been to both on his first trip.
"We did find Roturua to be very unlike anywhere we have ever visited, Your nose soon gets used to the rotten egg smell, and the thing that really sticks in my mind is the boiling mud pools.Picture a giant pan of porridge simmering, plop, plop.,plop, quite fascinating.Queenstown? No comment."
"deSchenke and John, I am so appreciative of your time and recommendations to our travel itinerary. Seems to be a great time to plan a trip! ; ) I am noting the option to do a domestic flight or two to free up a few days. And, thanks for the heads up on the car contract!deShenke, a special thanks for sharing your favorite trip itinerary! It looks like we have similar interests!John, you are correct. No interest in Rotorua (except for the Hot Pools!!!) nor Queenstown when there are so many other places to discover!A bit more disclosure on the ATNP aspect. Last visit we stayed in Kaiteriteri 2N, and took the water taxi to Totaranui, disembarked, and took the trail to Anapai Bay. We LOVED it there. But, b/c we were restricted to the WT time table, we decided that we would approach the park from the N end on the next trip. Maybe I mean, we would like to focus our time not necessarily in ATNP, but more toward the N end of Golden Bay. Hopefully that explains a bit.Winetasting....you are correct, we can do that in so many places, that setting our sights on Martinborough may not be the best use of our time. Maybe, I could just do some tasting in Blenheim, and also catch that beach drive to Kaikoura?We could then skip the W Coast of the S Is, (spent time in that area, did Glaciers, Haast Pass, etc last trip) and head to Mt Cook, then Wanaka, Glenorchy.New Itinerary could look something like this:(Am I making any progress!?!?!?)Day 1: Arrive Auckland/ferry to Waiheke Isl/wine tasting 2NDay 2: Acclimate/wine tastingDay 3: Ferry to Auckland, p/u car, drive to Whangarei/snorkel 2NDay 4: WhangareiDay 5: Drive to Opononi 2NDay 6: Explore Northland (Waipoua Forest)Day 7: Drive to Kerikeri 2NDay 8: Explore NorthlandDay 9: Flight to NSN/Drive to Takaka 3NDay 10: Takaka/PoharaDay 11: Takaka/PoharaDay 12 Drive to Picton 2NDay 13: QCTDay 14: Drive to Kaikoura 1NDay 15: Drive to Mt Cook 2NDay 16: Mt CookDay 17: Drive to Wanaka 3NDay 18: WanakaDay 19 GlenorchyDay 20:Flight ZQN to WLG: Martinborough 1NDay 21: Drive to New Plymouth2NDay 22: New PlymouthDay 23: Drive to Raglan 2NDay 24: RaglanDay 25: Raglan to Auckland depart to SYDMany Thanks!T."
Looking better but I think you will still need an extra day stopping somewhere between Kaikoura and Mt Cook like maybe Methven as it is really too far to drive in one day.
"It's most definitely getting better.Something we haven't done yet, but is on my radar near Methven (suggested by GTS) is Washpen Falls. It's not a free walk, but I think the fee is rather nominal ($10) and it looks fantastic. But where to take the day off? Maybe Takaka? We did what we wanted to do in Golden Bay with 2 nights, perhaps you could too. (I'll circle back to this later)I question Wanaka for 3 nights when one of your days is a daytrip to Glenorchy, only to drive the same road to depart Queenstown airport. I'd say 2 nights Wanaka, and 1 night in either Glenorchy (very limited) or Queenstown (very expensive) so you don't backtrack.You seem committed to Raglan, is there a reason? My only time in Raglan is tainted by the fact the weather was absolute rubbish. But we have stayed in the Waitomo area twice - because cr@p weather doesn't affect cave exploring. But maybe that's not of interest to you. However, we did enjoy our ventures into the Glowing Adventures cave (I imagine Spellbound would have been equally appreciated due to limited sized tour numbers) and a day to explore the sights nearby and along Te Anga Rd (Ruakuri Tunnel Walkway, Mangapohue Natural Bridge, Piripiri Cave Walk, and Marokopo Falls walk).Golden Bay.... Ah, a favorite of mine. Let me count the ways... (and forget exploring ATNP)... Whararki Beach - must be at the lower half of tide (3 hours plus or minus) and be sure to venture past the Stone Bridge or Archway and I think it's best to walk the inland pasture area to descend on the beach from the south and walk northwards. A fantastic experience with seacaves, stone arches in the sea, broad beaches, maybe some photos of horseback riders and a seal colony. One of my top 5 highlights of NZ. And another top 5 was Rawhiti Caves!Now you may curse me when walking there. We went there on our 2nd NZ trip and a flash flood literally foiled our plans. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sk69xxCv34 But we were determined to go back. And it was breath-taking. Literally and figuratively.Other attractions in Golden Bay would include Wainui Falls, The Grove Scenic Reserve, Labyrinth Rocks, Ford Payne Scenic reserve, Pupu Springs, Cape Farewell, Pillar Point, and if you want to take a tour - Farewell Spit.Heading over Takaka Hill, be sure to check out Hawkes Lookout Walk and if the weather isn't great - Ngarua Caves are pretty cool ($$). If you have a few hours to kill, Harwoods Hole walkway is cool but we enjoyed the fork to Gorge Creek Lookout more. The road there is pretty scary being so narrow for 2-way traffic though."
"We dont know as yet if the LAX flights to Raro will resume in time for your planned trip. Which may mean that you will miss out on a visit to the Cook Islands early next year. Air NZ will be reluctant to continue offering services that were a loss-making venture. The LAX to Raro (return) route being one of them - hence the subsidies by the Cook Islands government in the former heyday of international travel.Air NZ will resume flights between Rarotonga and Auckland though. It's an important corridor for people to go from Raro to NZ, and v.v., plus of course freight services are essential for small island nations. But, the usual Air NZ flights leave Raro mid afternoon arriving into Auckland around 6:30pm. If you have never driven from Auckland to Northland before, don't attempt to do so in the same evening that you reach Auckland. I recommend flying from Auckland to Kerikeri. Saves the long car ride heading north to the Bay of Islands, or over to the Hokianga. Opononi and Omapere are both lovely twin-towns. But you will probably get more value from a BOI stay, then drive to the Hokianga and through Waipoua to stay at Warkworth/Matakana Coast or Orewa overnight before heading to the Coromandel."
"I am so thankful for all of these great tips to help us refine our itinerary!deSchenke: the video was pretty amazing! All of your Golden Bay and New Plymouth tips were right on! (We have the NZ Frenzy books...) And, I appreciate the attention to the detail at the Wanaka/Glenorchy juncture! WOW! We are not ""set"" on Raglan in any way. It was just a town that has come across my radar, so thought we'd take a look while we were in the area..  However, we have not visited the Waitomo region before, and it seems as if there is plenty to do. We could easily exchange the Raglan for Waitomo.greytraveller: I love your suggestions (Orewa and Methven!) It is those little places that others may miss that make the trip seem all the more personal!Frangipani: Thanks for the driving and flight tips! We love our road trips, so don't often think about the puddle jumper options as time savers. But, on limited time frame, these tips are welcomed! Also thank you for the recommendations on saving money in Northland. I will weigh the options.I think it looks like it is shaping up nicely! At least a skeleton plan is in place. Now, comes the fun part of fleshing out the details! So many great tips here to look into!"
"The trouble with cutting back from 3 to 2 nights in Golden Bay is that only gives you one full day, which you are set on visiting Totoranui. You could probably fit in The Grove and Wainui Falls on the way and Pupu Springs is close by.But if I were going the two highlights I wouldn't want to miss are the Farewell Spit Eco Tour and Wharariki Beach. Both are at the far end of the bay near Collingwood and irritatingly both need low tide to do, so it's not really possible to do both in one day.I'm with others in that you need another night between Kaikoura and Mt Cook. Given that there is a lot to do in Kaikoura I would plan to stay there for half a day and then maybe consider staying somewhere to the south of there to give you a head start on the following day's drive. If you can afford it consider a PurePod for a very special night or given your wine interest maybe a stay on one of the wineries in the Wairapa, a small wine region north of Christchurch.If you do the latter i might then drop Martinborough to get the extra night rather than losing one from Golden Bay. In your new plan you have it as one night before driving to New Plymouth - that's too far for one day's driving - it's a 360km drive."
"JohnEW, thanks for your kind attention to our itinerary. I agree that 2N in Takaka/Pohara is not enough. To clarify, the trip is not Totoranui focused, as much as it is N Golden Bay area. Thanks for the highlights and recommendations there!I will check out the Waipara wine region to see if that could work for a stopover after Kaikoura. There was also the recommendation of Methven (and I have heard Timaru is nice). If we drop the Martinborough night, are you saying it is too far to drive from Wellington to New Plymouth in a day? We will be picking up a car there after a flight from Queenstown. Thanks again!T in FL"
>> I have heard Timaru is nice<<LOL - how much did the Timaru Promotion League pay for that?TBH I've never had an International OR Domestic visitor express an interest in going there. Perhaps you like Dairy Factories?
"I was saying it was too far from Martinborough to New Plymouth. It’s doable from Wellington as long as you have all day, but not if you’re flying from ZQN that morning.Edit: You could fly straight to New Plymouth although would need a connection and would cost more.Edited: 5:35 pm, April 21, 2020 "
