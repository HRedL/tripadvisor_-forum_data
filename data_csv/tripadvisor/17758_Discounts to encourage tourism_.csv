"We arrive this weekend for a few days for the kids spring break. They would like to do Alcatraz, city tours etc. We are not overly concerned about Covid-19 but will take recommended precautions. Was curious if anyone had learned of any reduced rates for tourist activities to encourage visitors? I’ve seen a lot of reduced rates at hotels but we already have that taken care of as we are using our timeshare. Thanks in advance!"
"What did you intend to do in the first place? Call them up and see if they will give you a discount. Or do the decent thing, and pay what you would normally."
"Beyond the usual discounts that are always offered, I've not heard of anyone offering recent discounts motivated by the drop in tourism caused caused by the coronavirus."
I think this thing will have to go on a lot longer for us to start seeing discounts to encourage tourism. I was in the city on Saturday and everything looked just as busy as always.
It's probably months too early to expect any discounts.Is Disneyland offering reduced entrance fees for Disneyland yet?
Discounts are not going to attract many customers in this environment. The attractions revenues would actually drop. People are more concerned about their health and the elders in their family.
"The restaurants in China town were offering specials today, but they seemed to be of the normal hey, pick me rather than the restaurant next door. Food was amazing and well worth regular prices."
I wonder how the Exploratorium is dealing with things. They could so use one of those disinfectant spewing machines that I've seen on the news being used inside of airplanes.
"Seems kinda tacky and opportunistic to ask about discounts during an epidemic. Especially since many of these businesses are small, locally owned places that don’t make a lot of money even during good times. (I’m not talking about national parks or hotels).I am happy to pay full price and tip well during this time to keep local businesses thriving.Edited: 1:10 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Yiu might find some discounts on the Wharf, and in some restaurants trying to attract customers, but don't expect discount Alcatraz right now."
It's more likely that high volume/trafficked attractions will be closing rather than offering discounts to finagle people into getting infected! I'm seriously wondering about Alcatraz. Not a problem on the island but the ferry over should be a concern.
"The ferry might have only a dozen passengers and be as safe, comparatively, as a doctor's office waiting room."
You know that Alcatraz is down to a dozen per ferry?
"Thank you for the input and updates . Not trying to be an opportunist, we intend on paying as normal for all our planned activities and have no intention of asking for a discount was just curious if there were additional attractions that we might not have budgeted in otherwise. Thanks again!"
"The liability of inducing people to visit public places (thereby encountering Coronavirus) is ridiculously high.If someone is offering you a discount because no one else is going, you might want to think about why no one else is doing.Will Coronvirus push prices down - ultimately or temporarily? Unlikely. Instead, places will just shut down.Meeting the needs of tourists above public safety is not part of the legal game plan in California. if you get 'lucky' and find last minute discounts, make sure it's a reputable seller and be prepared for the entire venture to be cancelled by the National Park Service.If you buy your tickets through the NPS, you'll get a refund. If not - you might not."
At least the weather is better in the SF Bay Area than in the OC. Lots of little dynamism places.
It's all well and good for you to say that you're not worried for yourselves. But viruses move about when people are out and about. Best to stay home and #flattenthecurve.
"We regretfully cancelled to adhere with WHO recommendations. We are strong and of good health and not concerned for ourselves but know that if exposed we can pass things to others who are not, so hanging up our travel bags for now."
