"Hi,I will be in Tromso from 14th August until 17th, and then again from 24th until 6th September.I read that with a lot of luck I might get to see the lights. As far as I know the official tours don’t begin that early so given that I won’t have a car where are the best places in Tromso I should look?Telegrafbukta beach? Cablecar mountain? Anywhere else within walking distance or a short bus ride away?"
"Also, I am planning on doing the 5 hour fjord boat trip. Also, planning two nights at Sommaroy.Any other good boat trips or excursions that I shouldn’t miss?Are there any day trips to Senja or is that too far for a day trip?"
"Senja is too far for a day trip generally, but check the timetables for the Botnhamn-Brensholmen ferry. You do need your own car though.All available tours are presented on the Visit Tromsø site. With the lack of tourists, you may find that the offer is limited, so a rental car might be a better solution.You need a lot of luck for observing in August as the observation window is very short due to very short nights. You also need a clear sky and strong solar activity - more like winning the lottery...Edited: 9:48 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Thanks. It's not a dealbreaker if I don't see them this time but I'll just keep looking up and check the app just in case.I'm not entirely convinced that the flights won't be cancelled by then, anything can happen in the next two and a half weeks or so. :("
"As long as the infection rate in Germany is kept down, I do not think the flights will be cancelled. Norway had an evaluation yesterday, the next will be in two weeks. Fingers crossed. As for the Northern Lights, mobility is the key, you need to move around for the the all important clear sky. In August there is no real darkness, so you need a strong aurora. On a clear day the afterglow from the sun is strong and prolonged and the lights occur at random times. If it is not dark enough, the aurora will look like a cloud, if the sky is otherwise completely clear and there seems to be a moving cloud, it is probably the aurora. You cannot really tell from seeing with the naked eye, but will show green or greenish on a photo. The weather forecast is usually more useful than the app. www.yr.no"
"Ah ok, I see. I also have the first 5 days of September, maybe then the chances increase a little bit?I suddenly had another thought... am going to Svalbard for a week and hadn't really considered that none of the tours might be operating?!"
"Better check with the tourist office sites for tours available. The days are getting shorter and the nights longer until they are equal at the equinox. Usually good from mid September, but I have seen good auroras around September 10th.Hurtigruten is running and there are some expedition cruises too, so there may be some tours operating."
What's the best site or app to use to see what the KPI activity forecast for that particular day is? So I can see if it's worth walking to a darker part of town that night.
"Being so far north, even weak auroras are visible, so the KP index is not all that important usually. In your case, a strong Aurora is favourable to beat the not yet dark nights and afterglow from the sun. Anyway, the NL forecast is not really reliable until a few hours in advance.Far more important is the cloud cover which you can follow on the weather page www.yr.no The NL guides sometimes travel several hundred km into the interior if it is cloudy on the coast, so mobility is another important factor.I like the NL-forecast from Storm Geo as it is so simple. Only in Norwegian though - look for Nordlys."
"I have seen the Northern lights at August 14th! but, then you need to know what you’re looking for, since the sky it’s bright blue...But, from mid August the darkness begin to fall over Northern Norway...In begin of September it’s only 2 hours darkness, but explore the NL on blue sky together with glow on the sunset it’s amazing beautiful...During this two hours you need good weather and at least part clear sky and good solar wind speed... so, it’s a gamble, but lovely if you’re lucky..;)Please don’t think so much about the Kp index, it’s just a indication for what will happen...Your own patience is your key no. 1..;)For the sun activity and for see when they forecast the big solar storms, please check https://spaceweather.com/ (left menu).And on this one you can follow the real time activity, http://flux.phys.uit.no/cgi-bin/mkstackplot.cgi?day=00&month=00&year=0000&comp=H&site=lyr2a&site=bjn1a&site=tro2a&site=kar1a&site=kil1a&site=roe1d&cust=+Custom+%28above%29+ (flat line = no activity / up and down = the lady is active)All different lines is locations; TRO = Tromsø.Good luck and happy chasing..;)Edited: 6:04 am, July 29, 2020 "
"By the way, Tromsø is located in the Kp Zero zone, so some nights we have the best NL show when the Kp index is 0 or 1..."
Thanks to both. So I guess a tour is the best way to go. :)
"Yes, a tour is the best way, but you may have a hard time finding any till September. And still no guarantee."
"In August I will just see if I am lucky on my own (probably not haha), for September a few guides seem to begin already on the 1st so I will try my luck if the weather forecast is decent."
"If Norway imposes a 10 day quarantine on arrivals from Germany, where does it take place? Is it self isolation in the hotel that I have booked?"
"Yes, but more likely you would be denied entry unless you have a special reason to enter - tourism wouldn’t be accepted.Quarantine would be for Norwegians returning home.Edited: 2:20 am, August 01, 2020 "
Are you sure? I thought Spanish tourists could still come if they quarantine for 10 days?
Best official information I can find - https:/…But situation can change at short notice.Surely no point in traveling to Norway if you are confined to accommodation.
It's a bit old that link. I have seen newer ones stating that Spanish tourists can still go. I guess it depends on how long the trip is in total as to whether it's still worth it or not.
"Spanish tourists can still go, but 10 day quarantine required. There is no check if they actually quarantine though..... only way is to cancel flights, but even then one can sneak in via Sweden or Denmark or wherever."
If there is no check then what is the point....?
"The point is that everyone is supposed to respect the rules. Everyone arriving from Spain should quarantine for 10 days. I have not been seeing anything about Spanish citizens being turned away at the border, although that may be the case. Getting in via Sweden would still be possible."
"Update: You need to prove that you have suitable accomodation for quarantining. If not, you will be turned away at the border. So there is a certain check."
"Ok, but what is suitable accommodation? In my case for example, I'd be on my own in a hotel. I haven't booked breakfast but obviously I would need to eat so how does that work? The hotel has a snack bar/shop open 24 hours a day, can I use that? Can I have food delivered? There are, as usual, no clear guidelines so it's no wonder that people just do as they think best.Edited: 11:09 am, August 01, 2020 "

Doubt if hotel would be very happy accommodating you if you are supposed to be in quarantine. Perhaps an AirBnB would be a realistic option - though you would still have the problem of shopping for groceries if outside main centres where delivery not available. Really only suitable for Norwegians returning from ‘red’ countries.The guidelines are clear enough - https:/…Travel-quarantineWhile there is little control - if caught you could be fined.There would be very little point in travelling to Norway if you had to spend 10 days in quarantine.
"In quarantine you may go outside for walks and such, you may go for drives in a private car and you may go to the supermarket-this was the case for us when we had to quarantine in March, arriving from France. We had suitable accomodation, our own second home in Bergen. An airbnb would be more convenient than a hotel, more pleasant too."
"Thanks, but it's all very vague with 'doubt the hotel' this and 'AirBNB more convenient' that. If the hotel really doesn't want me then they should cancel my room. If they don't then it must be allowed. As you say, you can go out for walks and to the supermarket. If that's the case then 10 days of that isn't so bad after all. As long as I don't join any tours where I am in close proximity to others."
"Dyoll, The quarantine period would be less than half of my total stay so there would still be a point in going in my opinion, especially if I can go for walks and get food from the supermarket."
"Any news on whether Germany has been added to the quarantine list? The meeting is tomorrow, right?"
Germany is still well below the 20 per 100.000 limithttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea
Update has arrived.https:/…
