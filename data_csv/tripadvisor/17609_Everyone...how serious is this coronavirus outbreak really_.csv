"Very very serious. It is worse than you imagined times 10. Anyone try to play it down or sugarcoat it is not foing China any favor. Last thing they need now is complacency or any tourists, give them a break, help out by not going to China."
"#1: on what ground do you base your conclusions? Are you in the area, or is it all hear say?And of what area are you talking about? Hubei or China? Is it worse than the Flu victims in the USA, where at least 15 million flu illnesses, 140,000 hospitalizations and 8,200 deaths from flu are accounted for this season alone?If I look at the measurements that are take, nothing indicated they are trying to save the tourist industry. So that reasoning makes no sense.I'm not saying this is not serious. But that is related to the lack of insight in the virus right now, not the numbers (yet).Edited: 4:12 am, January 26, 2020 "

For those of you can read it then this Washington Post article indicates the level of effort and urgency put into it:https:/…Mac is Mac as regular readers know.
When was it last time 35 million people were quarantined? All attractions closed? All public transport closed? Let’s ban all travelers from China now.
"I am surprised moderators have not taken action on Mac, the level of unnecessary fear he is spreading is completely irresponsible and uncalled for. Just look at all his other posts in the China forum. ""It is worse than you imagined times 10"" because he knows how other imagine it like a mind reader?"
"Wow looking at Mac's postings, I am surprised that I am still alive walking the streets of Shanghai like countless other people do as well."
Agree. Mac is apparently off his meds and needs a serious time-out from the forum.
"China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday that the new coronavirus is contagious even in its incubation period, which lasts up to 14 days, and that the virus’ ability to spread is getting stronger.Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of the NHC, told a press briefing that the authorities’ understanding of the virus was “limited” and they were also unclear on the risks posed by possible mutations.Ma said that unlike Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) the new coronavirus was infectious during its incubation period.From Bloomberg:In early January, doctors in Wuhan, a transportation and tech hub in central China, worked frantically to save the life of a 61-year-old man infected with a new and unknown virus. He checked in with severe pneumonia, on top of his preexisting issues with abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. Infection-fighting medicines didn’t work. His blood was pumped through an artificial lung, then he went into septic shock and his vital organs shut down. He slipped away on Jan. 9.This was no ordinary death. His passing was publicly flagged in an official statement posted by Wuhan’s city government and marked the first known fatality from a viral outbreak that has alarmed infectious disease experts worldwide since news of the illness surfaced in late December."
"@Mac, travel ban is not recommended by infectious disease experts, probably for valid reasons.To OP, this outbreak is very serious, no question about it. What's your point of your question? If you plan to go to China, consider to postpone your plan, the curve hasn't peak yet, means the fight is still at critical stage."
"We shall see who is right, serous as I said or not serious as many others said here. I have no intention to silence those who claim this is not serious, but they want to silence the pinion they don’t agree with. If they can get rid of me, then everything will be fine and happy, whole thing will just go away. These are the same folks who said this is not serious a month ago or a week ago. What do you think the news and numbers will be tomorrow, next week?"

Which parts of the Bloomberg news report and China’s National Health Commission statement you think is over the top? Alarmist and irresponsible?
You are an alarmist and irresponsable!!
But which parts of the Bloomberg news report and China’s National Health Commission statement you think is over the top? Alarmist and irresponsible?
"It is not Bloomberg or CNH, it is you who is over the top."
But which posts are wrong? 10 times? Numbers are about 10 times more by now from 2-3 weeks ago. Is that wrong? What do you think the numbers will be in 2-4 weeks?
"Mac, you tell us. Tooeasy just stating this. You say it is worse, so you give figures. Do you know the demographics of the 2000 that are infected, and the 56 that died? Come with figures, not just some blunt statements.Yes, it can get very bad. But given the population, and the density, I'm still surprised it is within this limit. So maybe there is hope, it will be contained."
"Of course it will be contained and go away. When and what numbers? Your guess is as good as mine. We both read the same news and reach different conclusions, human nature. I have seen this drama before with SARS. You guys are too young to know it. Is it possible those who downplay the seriousness of the Coronavirus are the irresponsible one? Some were encouraging families with children to continue to go to China just days and week ago. 10 times? already happened, I don’t think that was off the mark, in fact, I seen much higher estimates but did not say it."
"2744 confirmed cases, 80 death."
"I think some of you guys may not want to down-play the seriousness of this outbreak.Put aside Mac's personal opinion for a moment.The number of deaths (deaths, not just cases) jumped from 56 to the latest 80 from yesterday to today.The Chinese officials decided to halt the inter-provincial transportation, and ask residents to stay home for 2 weeks. In the middle of the biggest Chinese holiday period this year. Many scheduled celebrations had been cancelled. Many businesses had announced closures (e.g. Shanghai Disneyland). I saw a report estimated the travel ban will affect 56 million travelers. (e.g. https://tinyurl.com/vex8wj6 )Do you think a government will make this kind of decisions lightly? FIFTY SIX MILLION people affected! What is the population of your own country?I just take a layman approach in my evaluation. You don't need to weigh in on any single individual's view. But you should pay attention to those governments who are responsible for the well-being of their citizens and their actions. You and I do not have medical experts to give us advice. But those governments do.Out of the latest list, I counted 30 provinces / SARs have confirmed cases of the outbreak.  https:/…coronavirus-count-in-beijingEdited: 11:26 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"I don't think any reasonable person here is disputing the seriousness. I think it's much worse than the mainstream news reports, and don't personally believe a word of the official statistics. It's very clear that sick people are being sent away from hospitals (particularly in Wuhan) without any testing or confirmation. The medical community is overwhelmed and only working with the most serious cases right now, until reinforcements and supplies are in place. Do all of these people have coronavirus? Maybe not, but a goodly many of them do. My secret Chinese Statistic Washamatic Formula for getting to the real numbers tells me there are probably 75,000-100,000 infections right now. Some of them milder or moderate, but most if not all capable of spreading contagion. Deaths aren't properly being recorded either, but I'm sure it is more than the 80 they are reporting, and will go higher. But it certainly isn't as virulent as SARS or we'd be seeing a lot worse by now, and it isn't Ebola. I think what many people here are becoming irritated with is the strident, almost manic presentation, sometimes multiple times per hour and across threads, of at least one and maybe two forum members. There is an element of creepiness in that these poster(s) are trying to purposely incite panic and are thrilled to be doing so. Panic helps nobody, anywhere. Sorry, but that's how their tone comes off to me---thrilled at disaster, under the guise of providing a ""public information service."" It doesn't help that the TA forum format is inherently disorganized and improperly moderated.Edited: 12:53 am, January 27, 2020 "
I don't understand. You say what they are doing about at unprecedented speed and conclude that things will get worse?I guess you were more comfortable with SARS when they did nothing and things got much worse?
"You have a disease whose incubation period lasts up to 14 days. It can be transmitted airbourne. Basically, it can be transmitted without the carrier showing any symptoms. When it is in its advanced stage, you will probably get pneumonia. When you are in that advanced stage, you pretty much have to go to a hospital. The problem occurs when there are more people with pneumonia than there are beds in a hospital. This is what is occurring in Wuhan and is beginning to happen in other parts of China. For all those people who says influenza kills more people. Yes, that is correct if you get treatment, but when is that last time that a hospital was overwhelmed with patients with the flu? That last time probably occurred in 1918-20 during the Spanish Flu pandemic. When you have to take care of yourself when you have pneumonia, I would think the odds of dying greatly increases. Getting sick with the coronavirus is not that serious if you are healthy and do not have a compromised immune system - the Chinese are treating patients with AIDS drugs. It's when alot of people have it that it becomes serious. It's too late for China - the quarantine should have began before people left for the Lunar New Year holidays."
"""Getting sick with the coronavirus is not that serious if you are healthy and do not have a compromised immune system"" - Actually a 36 year old man died who did NOT have any pre-existing conditions. There is a lot of reasons to be suspicious of the Chinese numbers. Its looking like they were covering up the outbreak initially and it started much earlier than they let on. I don't think we will know the full truth for quite some time."
"BREAKING: Death toll climbs to 106Confirmed cases in China soars to 4,515Bloomberg It way passed 10x prediction.CBS just reported Wuhan Coronavirus has no running nose symptom."
"The Philippines’ Bureau of Immigration will temporarily stop issuing tourist visas on arrival to Chinese nationals to help ensure the country remained free of the new coronavirus, its head said on Tuesday.“We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,” Jaime Morente, the bureau’s commissioner said in a statement."
Everbody this is very bad I was in Beijing 11 days ago & it was very evident there was a big problem I'm just waiting until Friday if i'm still ok it means i was lucky. Governments do not go around spending billions & knocking trillions off there economy for a flu epidemic. So all those who think this is scare mongering wake up its NOT G
"At some point, it is not if you can find or afford transportation to leave, but will any country take you in? will your home country take you? Hong Kong will drastically reduce cross-border travel with mainland China in a bid to contain the spread of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, starting with the shutdown of the two railways and denying entry to individual mainland travellers.Flights from and to the mainland will be cut by half and cross-border tour buses will also be reduced, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced in a press conference as she listed the containment strategy that stopped short of a total shutdown demanded by legislators from across the political spectrum.Beijing has agreed to stop issuing individual travel visas for mainlanders, who account for half of all such mainland arrivals into the city. The measures will be effective midnight Thursday"
"A new Coronavirus patient in Japan have never been to Wuhan, caught it in Japan. Thus far all foreign cases are travelers returned from or traveled to Wuhan. This is a new stage. A tour bus driver.Edited: 4:47 am, January 28, 2020 "
"""At some point, it is not if you can find or afford transportation to leave, but will any country take you in? will your home country take you?"" This is nothing but unfounded, idle speculation which does no good and is potentially harmful. By all means post facts, which may help people decide whether to travel, but it would be good if you could tone down the rhetoric about the forthcoming Armageddon. Thanks."
"The World Health Organization evaluated the risk of #WuhanPneumonia as “very risk in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level"" and admitted it had incorrectly claimed the risk as “moderate” in previous report.Unfortunately, all my previous posts came true. It is no time to down play the seriousness of the virus, no use to bully the messenger. Instead of online bullying, how about providing some facts? If you got any.Edited: 6:59 am, January 28, 2020 "
"Hi Mac I originally dismissed you comments as just another looney American, you are talking sense this is worrying. And by us traveling like I’m due to go next week. I’m potentially part of the problem, going to avoid China and reroute"
"My main worry now switched to business, agents, managers, staff and factories will not come back working Feb 5th as scheduled, for sure, our orders and shipments will be delayed. Seriously delayed. Apple and GM factories are closed, Starbucks are empty, stocks are dropping like rocks. Only the beginning. I need to figure out Spring shipments from China, if any, maybe none. We already switch main supply source to Japan, stockpiled China goods 2 months ago due to trade war, we will be okay. Highly unfortunate, all my scaremongering posts came true, what I wouldn’t say will also come true. In the end, all will be fine by May or June, virus is a winter thing. It goes away in summer. Don’t believe me, google it yourself. You can bully me, messenger of inconvenient truth, never worked, everybody tried at some point. Pile on. It is extremely irresponsible at this point to downplay or sugarcoat this Coronavirus, you can hurt innocent people and families. Be careful what you say."
"Boy I have seldom seen this ""shoot the messenger"" phenomenon as obvious as in this China forum. Here in US to be honest not enough reporting about this given the impeachment and Kobe stories being carried 24/7. Originally looked here as I have relatives that were booked for a trip in Feb. (now cancelled) and was amazed at so many still considering going given the situation. As each day goes by things have gone pretty such as MAC has predicted....I think a thank you for taking his time to post here is more appropriate here rather than the accusations of fear mongering. IN general I think his advice of no travel probably until close to summer makes perfect sense."

Germany confirms first human-to-human transmission outside of China.
"Taiwan also just confirmed first native Coronavirus patient who has never been to Wuhan, human to human in foreign country. Germany, Japan, Taiwan. Smart one was North Korea. It closed its border earlier on."
"WOW, this genius of a virus found a way to travel from one human to another. Is that really a surprise to you and did you think all those infected so far went to the same market in Wuhan and caught it there?Of course this virus can be transmitted from human to human, though I still like to see how you can catch it by simply looking someone into the eyes, as you posted as a FACT some days ago."
"la0wei,The virus is transmitted through the mucus of the body (parts of the body that are moist) which means your mouth, nose, genitals, anus, and, finally, your eyes. Remember that high ranking Chinese medical officier who got the disease though he had protective gear on? He wasn't wearing goggles."
"The number of confirmed cases of the rapidly spreading coronavirus infection in mainland China has reached 5,496, health authorities said on Wednesday, a total that surpasses that of Sars, the epidemic in 2003 that killed more than 600 people worldwide.The death toll has climbed to 131, they announced, with 840 newly confirmed cases in Hubei province.Sars infected 5,327 people in mainland China in nine months and killed 349 people, according to the World Health Organisation (WTO).The total deaths from the new coronavirus infection are all reported in mainland China, with 125 in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, and six in other provinces. About 3,300 people are hospitalised in Hubei province, with more than 20,000 being observed for infection."
That eye post was misleading only in the way it was put the fact is it can be absorbed through the eye membrane according to a report from a medical institution G
"Make of this what you will:An expert from the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peakAustralian scientists have replicated the virus in a lab in what the BBC term a ""significant breakthrough""(Source: BBC website)"
White House in discussion on ban on all flights between US and China.@MacJourney1 How likely do you think this will happen and within what time frame? My partner is planning on returning to NYC on February 9 and we fear that this might be too late and the ban might already be in place. He has a full-time job to get back to and also job interviews lined up for March.
"""White House in discussion on ban on all flights between US and China."" - I wouldn't buy into that reporting. Maybe someone threw out the idea at a meeting but there have been denials that its under serious consideration at this time. Obviously they would never rule anything out because you don't know what the future holds, but things would need to escalate to get to that extreme."
Same here...walking around Guangzhou...just being careful to wear a mask and wad my hands.
"Current WHO figures at 4593 cases globally, 106 deaths, 56 outside of China https:/…With current evolving information putting it into context the 2003 SARS virus outbreak had 8096 cases globally reported, 774 deaths so about 9% death rate versus Corona at about 2-3% much lower. SARS was 50% fatal to the elderly and young/ infants. We survived and forgot about it, hopefully we will get through this as well.Putting it into context to global flu and respiratory diseases there are about 650,000 deaths annually https:/…"
"As more and more airlines are cancelling their flights - few airlines will be left - if at all to fly out of China. At least for Europe.As this is not a ban - but so far mainly commercial decision (empty planes) - if in China right now - I would try to get an earlier flight back - most airlines should be willing to re-book you freely if they have spaces left (makes it possible to cancel more flights for them).On the other hand - at least Europeans are now evacuated without too much problems from Wuhan (you have to organise your transport by yourself as it looks like, so need a friend and send the number plates to the authorities latest 8 hours before flight departure to get the car cleared for transit - as private cars right now are not allowed to be used for transit). Depending on the numbers - most likely also Europeans with fever will be flow out at a later date with special medical air planes - but that is not so sure yet.However it seems most countries will quarantine you for 14 days after arrival from Hubei/Wuhan if you fly out on the evacuation flights (if you manage to get out otherwise - at least in Germany it would be illegal to quarantine you - even right now most likely you could get a lawyer to get you out of quarantine after arrival). The arrival situation with quarantine, where and so on is right now causing some delays i.e. for Germans (first everyone was informed to be flown out today, now postponed to Saturday departure on EU shared flights).So most likely there will be some way to get back - even if all of China is quarantined - which is not so likely right now."
"Oh yeah - if you are resident of an Asian country - I would not go right now. Have a friend from Singapore stuck in Wuhan, and the Singapore government does not seem willing to evacuate anyone - because public in Singapore is against letting anyone in from Wuhan/Hubei. So she is stuck (and overstaying her 2 week visa free stay, but right now cannot get to any office to prolong/get a proper Visa. But guess the Chinese will be flexible there on exit)."
British Airways has stopped all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus outbreak.
"The big tech companies on facial recognition technology are working 24x7 to analyse the whereabouts of the people infected, and whom they met. So the government can track down those people to check as well. So the most criticised technology suddenly becomes one of the strongest technology partners in fighting the spread of infections."
"The Lufthansa Group, British Airways, and Indonesia’s Lion Air Group have cancelled all flights to the mainland, while the likes of United Airlines, American Airlines, Air Canada, IndiGo, Finnair, and Jetstar Asia have drastically reduced their services.American announced it would cancel its Los Angeles flights to Beijing and Shanghai from February 9 until March 27, citing a sharp drop in demand. Its existing flights to China from Dallas would continue as would services to Hong Kong.Lufthansa, which includes its sister airlines Swiss International Air Lines, and Austrian, and accounts for more than 100 return flights a week, said it would halt all China flights until February 9.BA, which operates daily services to Beijing and Shanghai, said the cancellations were in effect until January 31, although its website appears to show they are not taking any bookings for direct flights to the mainland until March 1.Hong Kong ordered all airlines to cut flights to and from the mainland by half on Tuesday.More foreign governments have recommended all but essential travel to China, prompting some airlines to act, while others admitted the spread of the virus had seen passengers reschedule or cancel travel, leading to near empty planes flying in and out of the mainland."
"“@MacJourney1 How likely do you think this will happen and within what time frame? My partner is planning on returning to NYC on February 9 and we fear that this might be too late and the ban might already be in place. He has a full-time job to get back to and also job interviews lined up for March.”Ying, just saw your post, personally I’d leave now, urgently, immediately, pack up and go. We all judge crisis differently, I rather err on the side of caution, than regret with dire consequences. They may not have flights to come home or new quarantine maybe in place by Feb 9th."
"Oh yeah - and with overstated I mean the likelihood to die if you get nCoV. I assume that most foreign experts are correct that the total cases are way too low for Wuhan. I don't believe in over 100.000 - but I do think a factor of 5 to 10 is likely. However the death cases - should be correct at least since 24.01 (before I doubt the numbers - different politics then). So maximum double them (more likely add 50%). If that's the case - it is not very dangerous at all as long as you are healthy.E.g. all 4 people infected in Germany are supposedly already symptom free. They had like a 1 day flu. Without the knowledge of the possibility of nCoV due to the Chinese visitor which fell ill - it most likely would not have been discovered. They are by now all symptom free!(source: https://www.merkur.de/welt/coronavirus-deuts… )If most people only have a runny nose for 1-2 days, or a bit of coughing but infect others around them - this virus cannot be quarantined IMHO (at least not without breaking down the world economy)I think if you are there - ask for a free change to an earlier flight - if they don't grant it - you can be pretty sure they will fly on the 09.02 - maybe ask for it every 3 days / or make sure they enter you into a list. I would not pay for an earlier return - except if right now you feel like wasting 10 days in China because most things are closed and you can make better use of that time at home. I personally would not be afraid about the virus as long as you have no health problems."
"The number of known coronavirus cases jumped by 1,737 to to 7,771 in China on Thursday morning including the first confirmed case in Tibet, according to health authorities, raising the global total to almost 8,000 – and nearing the total infections worldwide in the Sars outbreak of 2002-03.The epidemic’s death toll also continued to rise sharply, by 38 since Wednesday, taking the total to 170 – all in China – as of Thursday morning. The coronavirus is believed to have originated last month in a market that sold wild animals in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China."
