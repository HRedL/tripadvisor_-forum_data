Hello - I have to admit I had never heard of Valley Fever before until I just saw something on the news about it in Phoenix. Is this something to be concerned about in Sedona too? Should we bring a mask with us while hiking in case of a dust storm?Thanks~!
"I've never experienced a dust storm in Sedona. It is a more secluded area and doesn't have the long stretches of desert-like landscape where the winds pick up the dirt for miles and miles and the dirt comes in on a huge wave like an air tsunami. Valley Fever is fungal in nature and a real health concern though and could be carried around on secondary wind currents for a while. We lived in Saudi Arabia and had sudden Shamals there that mimic the latest huge dust storm in Phoenix. **Those little masks take so little room, for your peace of mind, bring enough for everyone in case you do get a lot of dust in the air. You most likely won't have to use them but you'll have them.Dust Storms Spread Valley Fever - iLongevityhttps:/…dust-storms-spread-valley-feverLearn how to protect yourself against and recognize the symptoms of valley fever, especially if you live in an area prone to dust storms."

"Every breath you take could have valley fever spores in it. In the Phoenix area that is almost certain. If you have a compromised immune system you have a stronger chance of it taking hold. Pregant orientals are especially vulnerable.Your chances of actually getting valley fever are small. However if you have a lingering cough after visiting, you might ask the doctor for a test to see if you have it. Though rare, it can be fatal. My next door neighbor died from it and I had a serious case that required a month in the hospital and 4 months of outpatient IV treatments.Edited: 5 years ago "
wow! Thanks everyone! That is some crazy information that I had no idea about before....and we leave tomorrow! I will be picking up some masks today to take with us. I would rather error on the side of caution!
Never really seen any dust storms in the Sedona area.
"Valley Fever is fungal in nature and a real health concern though and could be carried around on secondary wind currents for a while. So any time dust is raised and you breathe it in, there is a slight potential, even if its not a ""storm"". Better to be overly cautious than sick later. I do agree though that one is less likely to be exposed to Valley Fever in Sedona. Being caught in that sudden huge tsunami of dust that they had down there in Phoenix is a different story.Edited: 5 years ago "

"[ had to delete my post to edit one more time ]Stop worrying . . . and get medical advice before your trip. Dust and the stuff that is carried in dust can wreak havoc on the lungs of some people. Very quickly. Like with just 2 breaths. Ask me how I know. It's not fun when it happens. So I say, Don't stay home because something in the environment *might* trigger an episode. Just be prepared knowing that *it* or *anything* could happen, be aware of environmental and climate triggers for you, and pack accordingly for your trip. Also, remain flexible in trip plans. I would rather switch out trip plans than have to make a quick trip to the ER. Enjoy your trip!A personal perspective . . . My hubby knows and acknowledges that when we visit the NR which is remote, remote as in two hours to the closest hospital, if something in the climate or in the environment triggers a breathing episode in me, even with my arsenol of inhalers (quick-acting/rescue inhaler, long-acting/maintenance inhaler, and Epi-Pen), we are OUT of there, we are to pack up quickly and get OUT -- even if the middle of the night! We can check out by phone or e-mail, or pigeon, or some other way. But we still go to the NR and enjoy it very much.Hope this helps!CopperEdited: 5 years ago "
"Thanks, Copper! What is the NR?"
North Rim of the Grand Canyon.
They probably mean The North Rim of the Grand Canyon. I have lived in AZ for over 50 years and have never had Valley Fever. The areas to be concerned are where dust is being kicked up. Mostly Construction sites. I would not worry about dust storms they only kick up surface dirt most spores are under the top soil. Most people will never even hear about it. Very rare.Edited: 5 years ago 
"Yes indeed, very rare but unlucky if you do get it. IMO its just better not to bury your head in the sand. Be aware that it exists and if you begin to feel funky, bring the symptoms back to mind but do NOT obsess about it. Especially in Sedona.This is an interesting read if you are at all interested. If you tend toward hypochondriac territory skip it. Its from last year.Valley Fever Epidemic In Arizona - Business Insiderbusinessinsider.com/valley-fever-epidemic-in…"
"Valley Fever is not ""rare"" exactly. Over a third of residents of ""highly endemic"" areas (Phoenix, Tucson, southern Central Valley, CA) will eventually test positive for VF infection. I tested positive for it as a kid, and remember a couple of kids in grade school who missed months of class with it. The bad, systemic infection only occurs with 1% of infections, however, so bad infections are unusual. What's odd is that many ID and Pulmonologists practicing here still don't think to test for it when they are dealing with a stubborn respiratory infection.In any event, this is about the last thing I would think of to worry about as a short term visitor to northern Arizona.Now, hantavirus on the other hand...Just kidding."
"I contracted Valley Fever as a child in southern Arizona, along with my mother. I was practically symptom free while my mother had more severe symptoms, but nothing that disrupted her daily life too much."
"If you have ""never"" experienced the effects of Valley Fever then you have no room to comment as to ""no worries"". Only about 40% of the cases are symptomatic beyond what seems like a little cold, but when you're one that is included in that 40% it is ""seriously frustrating"". I stayed one week in August 2015 in Maricopa; one week after I returned home I developed a chronic cough that has hounded me incessantly (7 months now). I struggle with shortness of breath, I have pulmonary nodules from the cocci, and this disease is incurable. All you can do is take meds that will ""hopefully"" put it into a dormant stage. So before you make any tripe to the southwest desert areas .... do your research and take the recommended precautions. Oh and by the way ... simple masks don't keep this fungus out of your lungs so make sure you get a high quality mask to wear while outdoors hiking, riding, whatever you do."
Just be aware that it is out there and many people do get it
"Not rare just misdiagnosed. Most people think they have pneumonia, bronchitis or some other upper respiratory infection. It shows up like pneumonia on x-ray. Unlike URI's, pneumo, or bronchitis it can stay with you for life become dormant and show its ugly face years down the road when you are in a vulnerable state of health. One of the biggest symptom is joint pain which often gets overlooked or misdiagnosed and when it has gotten to joint pain it is in the later stages requiring IV antifungals."
"This thread is almost a year old. I think this is a moot point.Nosfellot, I have lived here over 50 years, I have the right to comment."
