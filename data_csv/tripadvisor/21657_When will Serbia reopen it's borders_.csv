"I'm just wondering what information is floating around. I don't read or speak Serbian unfortunately. Just want to give a shout out to the absolutely amazing Serbian people I have had the good fortune to meet during my unplanned six, going on seven week, stay here."
"No one knows yet, Brian.Vucic has been saying they will try to relax rules by early May but it all depends on the numbers. I suspect you will be able to get out before others are allowed to get in.I know there was a repatriation flight for US citizens last week, I would check with the US Embassy to see if there are any more.Mind you, looking at New York currently and listening to Trump at his news conference last night,.... well, to put it politely, I'd be inclined to stay in Serbia! ;-)All bestStooferEdited: 1:35 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"In the meantime, a fellow American-locked-in-Serbia has became a minor YouTube celebrity with his lock down diary:https://www.youtube.com/user/cather76Not that he's exactly my cup of tea, but I do appreciate his sincerity and spirit. I'm not sure if this is even on-topic, but hey, in this age any mood-rising attempt goes, I guess."
"'Serbian authorities have messed it up completely'Not sure if that's fair or not, they've done a lot more and faster than many other European countries. The jury is still out on what are best measures, not sure anyone will know until a long way down the track.Every country has different issues IMO Stoofer"
"makicacI got sucked into watching Charles' 'quarantine' videos, I think he's on day 29 doing a daily blog.The guy is very passionate about Serbia, it's interesting that he promotes it, hopefully will give his compatriots food for thought. I've yet to meet an American or Brit that (unless visited Serbia) has a clue as to the reality in the country. The 'western' media trashed this country and continues topaint a rather negative picture, in the most part. ;-(Fair play to Charles, he's certainly getting noticed. Stoofer"
"FWIW nothing I have said is incorrect. I simply raised a question over so much 'expert opinion', there is much that we don't know and, as I said, the jury is out and won't convene for years regarding what countries acted most efficiently. Each country is different with demographics, health, wealth, population hot spots and international visitors not to mention how they report their figures. Quite frankly when you look at comparisons it's impossible right now, the media love to do so and some politicians use it to sell their policies but in reality it serves little purpose without consistent reporting criteria.I'm not defending anyone here but it's obvious the default position in other Balkan counties is to discredit Vucic for political and historic reasons. I therefore have little interest or confidence in commentary from other Balkan countries or the EU for that matter, 30 + years watching local politics leads to that simple conclusion.Either way - support him or loathe him - and for this I sit squarely on the fence, one thing for is for sure, Vucic is no moron.Stoofer"
"Yes, while this insanity is going on, it's good to hear this ""adopted"" American. He’s pretty frank and immediate.(Stoofer, recently you have been in a dilemma whether I am Charlie's producer or Charlie personally. I assure you I'm not Charlie, I'm much more handsome than him. lol)Tarik, stop trolling."
"I'm no fan of Vučić and his clique either, but he's done a relatively good job by giving up the helm to the experts and only giving his usual sermons to his faithful flock from time to time. Used to be far worse in ""normal"" times. He may be, um, sociopathically-challenged but he's no moron. Enough said.As far as I can see, all the Balkan countries are going through fairly well in terms of human cost. As for the economy, the proof will be in the pudding. The differences are generally slight, and as Stoofer said, each country is a slightly different story.My favorite COVID progression and country-comparison site:91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/Serbia's 700 cases per million are not that bad to Croatia's 427 or Bosnia's 336, particularly when you compare that to several Western countries at the same stage of the epidemics. However, the whole humankind is in the same sh*t and I don't think this is the best time to exercise politician-bashing (Trump exempted, of course)."
"I agree regarding politician bashing regardless of affiliation.What strikes me is the impossible situation any leader in Serbia has to face, being pulled 'east and west'. The pressure is enormous, unlike the other Balkan countries who very quickly sold out as many would see it.On a social level he may seem awkward at home but he's quite impressive on the world stage, good language and negotiation skills when I've seen him interviewed overseas. Sorry if that's political, I'm not promoting him, just noting the uniquely difficult position of Serbia for whoever is leader. Easy target for all sides!Good graphs Makicac. My point was that graphs are only as good as the data. UK has serious issues with what is and is not being reported. Only yesterday Catalona admitted their death data did not include care homes and home deaths so their number is in fact double, if that's the case across Spain the numbers are scary. Testing capacity hugely different in every country and accuracy in question. Hence, are comparisons relevant until all input is equal?Just sayin.Keep safe guysStoofer"
"Just to qualify what I said here, after this post the most recent press conference the U.K. are now quietly inserting ""in hospital"" when showing their number of daily deaths. Close to 900 in last 24 hours.Care home and funeral directors reporting large numbers of deaths suspected to be from Covid-19, because they can't test and be sure they are not in the figures!Close to scandalous IMO, the figures are wrong, daily death rates are much higher than on the data. It's becoming an elephant in the room! ;-(Stoofer"
"Charles has been making videos about Serbia for the last 8 years. He's appeared on Serbian TV shows, news interviews and in newspapers before, so he's been a minor celebrity in the country for years. So it's not like he's just become known in the country because of his quarantine videos. I've only been following his channel for a year but I've watched enough of his old videos to understand his history with Serbia and his presence in the country. On topic, there will probably be more repatriation flights for US citizens coming soon. You just have to pay attention to the news and seek out the information in English online. Countries all over are focusing on getting stranded citizens back now and it's a priority before they even think of opening up the borders again for tourists.Edited: 4:37 am, April 17, 2020 "

"Dusan PExcellent points and a very embarrassing video. It is true what you say, in UK we say people in glass houses should not throw stones.The figures out of Serbia do suggest they are ahead of the game compared to most western European countries. A mistake or unfortunate turn was the diaspora as you suggest. I think that will be the next complication for every country.I agree the Asian and Chinese model seems best followed as they are 'the experts' and got a grip. Of course we can only guess, none of us are experts but when you listen to some of our leaders speak, Vucic makes more sense than most on this subject IMHO.As with the video, I feel the same way about UK leaders and their advice and tactics, I hope I'm wrong but so much of it smacks of lunatics running the asylum ;-(Stay safe folksStoofer"
"So stay in Serbia.. if you don't like Trump Stsy out of America! S,AH!"
Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate. I really just need to know if I have to apply for a visa if I hit the 90 day mark prior to the border reopening. A little help?
"Brian P. You never asked more specific questions about visa, just about borders reopening. It's a highly charged subject and a free comment forum but I think everyone has been honest and polite here, typical forum banter IME.On the day you posted you immediately received comment and advice, did you follow it by contacting your embassy?What you ask now is debatable, again consular assistance or apply online. IMO there will be flexibility if you have overstayed because it's not your fault but I'm no expert. There have been repatriation flights as noted, so again, did you apply for those? In your position I would certainly register my situation at your embassy, they will be able to give you up-to-date advice and what action to take, if any. Sorry if you feel no help here, I don't think that's the case. If you want to criticise members input I could note when asking for 'help' then a please and thank you never goes amiss.Good luckStoofer"
"Stoofer, the first sentence of my reply is an American pop culture reference which I hope at least one person would have gotten. It has nothing to do with criticism of anyone. Ain't nobody got time for that!"
I try to avoid all pop culture ;-)Do let us know if you get feed-back from your embassy or Serbian authorities.Stoofer
"Any updates when borders/airport will reopen and allow foreigners to enter? CheersEdited: 1:49 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"Well, it is now a couple weeks later, and there are commercial flights starting back up between Belgrade and London next week. Not clear on entry restrictions, though I the UK has been rather notoriously open to arrivals during this time. I am looking to leave soon, myself, though I don't really think it's safe to do much travel at this point, and the EU is closed to non-EU until May 15 at the earliest. I really dislike how people have turned this into a political discussion, it was a simple travel question on a travel forum. One thing I hate here is how people don't seem to be capable of creative conversation or jokes, it's just complaining about politics all the time. If I had met even one Serb capable of enjoyable intelligent conversation, I might actually want to stay instead of watching the borders so closely for a chance to leave."
"""I really dislike how people have turned this into a political discussion, it was a simple travel question on a travel forum"" The OP received advice immediately and a discussion followed, so what? It's an open forum! I don't see complaints or arguments either. ""One thing I hate here is how people don't seem to be capable of creative conversation or jokes, it's just complaining about politics all the time. If I had met even one Serb capable of enjoyable intelligent conversation, I might actually want to stay instead of watching the borders so closely for a chance to leave""Oh really?I'm sure your compatriots are really proud of you for demonstrating why there is so often negative ignorant/arrogant U.S. stereotypes on European travel boards. Well done!Stoofer"
What's wrong with this bla-blaTarik creature? Poor guy...
"Stoofer, you read too much into others' posts. Chill out, dude."
"Brian P, I'm perfectly chilled thank you.I also know exactly what to read into: ""If I had met even one Serb capable of enjoyable intelligent conversation...."".People that come on here to be rude and condescending to locals will get the help and comments they deserve. Stoofer"
Please stay on topic
""" I don't see other countries letting Serbian citizens traveling in without quarantine either - nobody wants to import new infected from Serbia""All very well posting stats but you can read into them what you will. I'm really not sure the link demonstrates why Serbia should be singled out as 'worse' than anywhere else. It's too soon and the data too inconsistent.Quite simply, each country is reporting differently making a mockery of the global response and networking. It's highly unreliable.To dwell on your stats. On that chart death rates per million are fairly similar in the Balkans, within 2-3 a million, it does show Serbia as having twice as many new infections reported than it's neighbours but when you suggest other countries should beware of Serbia then why not go along to Austria. 4 x the death rate of Serbia and twice as many new infections yet they are relaxing their rules.The Austria example at least puts it into context when charging any country in failing with duty of care.Folk need to look at what their countries rules are and link them to Serbia's in due course. A lot of people will be doing that next month. I'm sure a major concern is air travel, the industry on it's knees is a powerful incentive for countries to relax too soon IMOI think the saying is "" there are 3 kinds of lies, lies, damn lies and statistics. It really needs folk more qualified than us to make sense of the current stats on offer ;-)Stay safeStoofer"
"Post 32. I would refer to my previous post regarding stats. You appear more interested in playing some sort of blame game and you are free to do so of course. I read the situation slightly differently.I need to be in Serbia asap, tbh I'm far more worried about the U.K. airport and the flight than of being in Belgrade. I'm sure I'm not alone in fearing travel more than the destination, for a good while yet.Let's see what flights do start out of Belgrade and what each country employs for new arrivals. Stay safeStoofer"
"""I suggest to follow the Exyuaviation blog, as they are best informed and impartial""Now some that did just that will have tickets for flights that don't exist. I'll stick with my local knowledge, thank you.Stoofer"
"Dear Brayan,Serbian has opened borders for almost all countries.Please note that the current epidemiological situation in the Republic of Serbia about COVID-19 requires protection measures in certain cities.Starting from 30 June, the use of masks on public transport and in all closed spaces is obligatory in Belgrade, without any exception. All visitors to shopping malls, cafés, restaurants, night clubs, beauty parlors, gyms and the like, are obliged to wear protective masks while in those closed areas.So for all visitors who would like to visit Serbia, it is important to highlight that the masks need not be surgical – all non-surgical and protective masks which are made on your own are acceptable. The strongest recommendation to all visitors is: keep a distance, use disinfectants, wash your hands regularly, and avoid touching your mouth, face, and nose while outside. Act responsibly and take care of your health and the health of people around you.See You in Serbia again!"
"""Starting from 30 June""It's moved since 30th June - nightclubs are now closed 11pm - 6am and catering services.Social distancing is 1.5m, indoors and outdoors.Some other cities have more closed hours and it's all being reviewed again, this supposedly is now for 2-weeks. All the time numbers grow it can change.Stoofer"
"oh, sorry. Quick update. I flew from Belgrade to London on the 4th and London to NY on the 8th. Since I was continuously traveling through Europe for two years, it was a real culture shock coming back to the United States. Thank you to all my Serbian friends. You're the best!"
