What’s happening with easyJet flights back to uk from Malaga impossible to get they to them
Your profile shows you as being from Italy. Where do you want easyJet to fly you to and when?
I should imagine scheduled flights will continue unless / until airport is closed &/or FCO guidance is updated.Keep looking at the website for latest information.
"Obviously they will be under tremendous pressure at the moment. You've been answered in your other thread, so presume for now that you'll still be going and check Malaga Departures website on Monday or late Sunday. I know there are no flights out of Malaga to Gatwick with Easyjet until 30th March, I suspect other Airlines will be similar moving forward."
Do you not have a flight back on Monday? What’s the problem - lots of people don’t have.
"I'm sure he has a flight booked back to Luton, Katy, but he's wanting to confirm it's still scheduled to leave but unable to get through to Easyjet."
"Mate arrived from Southend , landed Malage 6-55pm local time & plane has taken off for return flight to Southend, little late but on it's way. So far it seems as if Easyjet still flying."
Jet2 website says they are contacting all passengers by the email they booked with. Alternatively go to a hotel and speak to a Jet 2 rep or the Jet2 desk at the airport.
There's an Easyjet London Gatwick - Malaga tonight with a scheduled return but after that.....who knows??
A TUI and a Easyjet aircraft left Bristol this morning. I fly home Tues. hoping my flight leaves BRS for the return.

"If anyone has obtained a refund from easyJet, let me know the secret of the website... I've just tried to get refund for day trip on weds, but it's only offering me change flights, despite following the sites instructions..."
"If you're travelling to one of the cancelled routes then in ""manage my bookings"" there should be an option to request refund I think... if not then they've screwed up. I have checked mine because I have flights for May, but as it's not in the ""no fly"" window til the end of this month I don't qualify."
"There is no option for refunds, just to change flights etc... I have asked on EJ FB page, but I'm not holding my breath for a instant reply. Its only £55, but every penny counts...If I get a reply, I will post on this forum.I also have flights for may, and hoping restrictions will be lifted by then, as I'm planning spending my 50th over there....Edited: 4:51 am, March 15, 2020 "
".Getting people home is more important than getting a refund, I think we'll agree.Easyjet is trying to get people back who are trapped in Spain.This is more important than me getting my money back from a cancelled flight, or rebooking my next holiday to Spain.So to reduce the traffic on Easyjet's website so that people stuck in Spain can get home andavoiding the Easyjet website crashing, #I'mKeepingEasyjetWebsiteClear.I hope you are too.Best wishes, keep safe..Edited: 4:57 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Good luck Steve - keep us updated, it may help with me if I end up being in the same situation for my trip in May. I'm back and forth quite regularly, but I tend to book mine quite a way in advance to lock in the best rates, keeping fingers crossed anyway."
".By the way...No, I am not in Spain.Yes, I am due a refund.No, I haven't tried to go on the website to reclaim, I am giving priority to those who are advised by Easyjet to try and book themselves back to UK#I'mKeepingEasyjetWebsiteClear Best wishes, keep safe"
"we're due to fly out with Easyjet on the 30th and as the current no fly period goes up until the 29th i suppose we'll be in limbo until the last minute. I'm guessing that date could be extended of course. At least if you're flight is cancelled you SHOULD get a refund if you can fathom out the process. Good luck to those currently trying to get back to the UK.Edited: 10:59 am, March 15, 2020 "
"First of all my apologies tourista.From what I've read EJ will email or txt either just before or on your departure date to inform you of your options. So no need to hassle EJ, they should contact you."
".Excellent news, Steve, thank you for passing that on!Keep safe, everyone."
"Repeated for new readers, save reading all the posts: https:/…coronavirus-spain"
"The link does not show flight info on phone, but I posted the same link (checked and not worked on phone) via my laptop and it worked... You may need PC to see info.Edited: 3:57 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"In another twist, my wife had e mailed our hotel (Balmoral) to ask the hypothetical question of where we stand if we can't get there. Since received an e mail saying our booking is cancelled even though we are due to arrive after the current lockdown period. Originally thought it was a misunderstanding but after speaking to reception they tell us they are having to close due to the coronavirus, hence our cancelled booking."
Link is not working on PC either... No showing any flights...
Apparently the list should not have been published and subsequently removed by EJ...

".Now (2 in the morning - I chose a time when I hoped people had got their flights home for tomorrow) , Easyjet have updated their website for flights that they are cancelling from Tuesday onwards, and any later flights you don't want to travel on.They say on the website:Your choices if you do not wish to travel.If you no longer wish to travel, you have the following options to choose from:You can choose to switch to a different flight through Manage BookingsYou can apply for a refund through Manage Bookings. Simply enter your booking details and follow the prompts.And they have now made it easy to do this.There is a big orange button next to your flight for REFUND.It seems a very simple system. You select what you want to cancel and refund, they show you the flights you have selected (I cancelled 4 flights, 2 there-and-back visits over next 2 months), ask you to confirm that you are asking for a refund, then you get within seconds a confirmation email.When you then go back to the My Bookings page, it shows Refund processing by the selected bookings.So as long as they don't go bust . . .Keep safe everybody."
"Thanks for the update TI, sorted mine out earlier..."
"For anybody wanting to book on a rescue flight leaving tomorrow and Wednesday. If you haven't received an email or sms telling you your original flight back home has been cancelled then check your flight in my bookings. I haven't received any email or sms telling me my flight was cancelled, it was only when I went into my bookings I saw in big orange and yellow letters that my flight had been cancelled. It was only then that I changed my flight to come home this Wednesday. If you want to fly home on a rescue flight don't wait for an email or sms off easyjet."
"Thanks ... applied for my refund. Now to sort out hotel booking, car parking and transfer.Jak xx"
same here. our original flight is our rescue flight. Our booking was still saying scheduled last night after they published the rescue flights so we naively assumed we had remained on the flight. couldn’t sleep and checked for emails during the night. Nothing. Then at five am i checked my booking and it had been cancelled. Managed to rebook onto the same flight. but when i had to check in again it made me select luggage- and then charged me. I didn’t want to risk losing our places so paid. I now have two bags! be aware !
".Glad people are getting their rescue flights sorted.Read carefully the above posts, folks, it seems you have to more or less rebook your home flight, even on same flight you were on originally.Keep safe."
Are there Easyjet flight to Liverpool on the 20th March
"Marion, look back on my long post, theres a link there"
"Disobeyed the stay in rule this morning and caught train to airport to sort out flight at EJ info desk. Given same flight time for tomorrow, but with different flight code.To add to confusion had a email off EJ this afternoon telling me my flight was cancelled.Which one? Original or replacement. We’re off to airport in morning whatever."
"we had that too! gave me a fright! it’s the 8602 , my original flight that they should have emailed me about yesterday! the rescue flight is 9602. I hope!"
".Glad to read that people are getting sorted, one way or the other, with rebookings, refunds or rescue flights.Those of you who do manage to make it back to UK, do give us your news.Best wishes ."
"Turista, appreciate your kind words"
"Same we are due to fly on the 14th of may, but people are telling me extremely unlikely it will happen now, 2 very disappointed kids but out of our hands"
Now that the UK government has ADVISED citizens not to travel anywhere abroad for 30 days will the airlines act on that and extend any cancellation period? As it stands easyjet have cancelled until the 29th. The difference between being advised not to travel and being physically prevented from doing so is quite important.
"Hi we have easyjet flight booked from Glasgow to Malaga 31 May but expecting not to go. Hoping to geta refund but nothing on Easyjet website, has anybody heard anything Thanks"
Too early to say. They've not started cancelling April flights yet.
"I'm in the same position, as I'm sure are others Famagusta - I guess we'll just have to wait it out and see what happens. I am surprised though that they've not updated their CV information since 13th March considering there have been updates since, especially from the FCO."
Hi Just rrealised I put the wrong date our flight out from Glasgow to Malaga is 31 March not May and still no news from Easyjet whether we will get a refund. Do not wish to rebook as I am not sure commitments. Any comments thanks
"Similar situation for us famagusta. Due to fly easyjet on the 30th. It's an on going situation and a waiting game I suppose. I'm resigned to not going in view of the FCO and UK government advice today however. Last time I checked the easyjet website they had cancelled flights until March 29th. I think if you click on thr 'read more' link in the Covid-19 section it has the latest update.Edited: 4:34 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Hi Jdscott1 thanks for reply. Yes keep looking like you on EAsyjet website. No I will not be going but need a refund as I will lose the cost of my accommodation I booked through booking com as it was non refundable. Usually book a package but thought I would do it myself this yr! Good luck and keep me updated if you hear anything. Thanks
As long as you booked your accommodation before 12th March 2020 your travel insurance should cover the cost of it.
"If, as likely your flight gets cancelled you will be entitled to a refund. Also if they extend the lockdown period then effectively it's the hotel cancelling your booking, not you declining it. Worth asking for a refund. Failing that, try your insurance as mentioned."
Thanks for reply. Will keep on eye Easyjet website for all updates. Not sure about accommodation refund but will check our insurance but cant see them paying for non refundable accommodation. Thanks
