"Hi everyone,I'm a bit stuck on where to go on honeymoon. We will be going in March/April from Ireland with our little girl who will be one year old.We would like to go somewhere warm but not too hot and not too far away. A long flight just isn't feasible with a baby. People have recommended the Canary Islands but we have already been there. There isn't much other choice in Europe that will be warm in March/April.We would like a week in a resort and maybe a week sight seeing or anything that is suitable to do with a one year old. We both love the outdoors and sight seeing.Thanks in advance!"
You've been to all the Canary Islands? Way to go!Greece? Malta? Southern Italy? Cyprus? Morocco? How long is too long of a flight? Caribbean is 8 hours away.
"I would not make any travel arrangements for Europe at present. The coronavirus situation is just too unpredictable. All of the countries mentioned in post #1 have cases; Italy is in lockdown until April 3 at least so you would not even be allowed into the country. I would defer travel until the autumn.And for heaven's sake, don't make any nonrefundable reservations. The Forums are filled with unhappy people complaining that they made nonrefundable reservations and now they cannot get their money back for trips they cannot take through no fault of their own."
"Hi everyone, I forgot to post that my wedding is in March 2021!Edited: 3:29 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Hey CReed, between us we have been seperately to the Canary Islands. All the European countries you mentioned will on hit 18/19C degrees in March. The low 20s would be perfect.I have been to Morocco but it might be an option, thanks!!We would both love to go to the Carribean but we would have a stop somewhere making the journey 12+ hours but I'll definitely look into it. Thank you!!"
"March/April time frame for the temps you mention requires you to go farther than Europe. Nassau or other Bahama islands are a little closer to Europe (but not much). Florida might suit you; I imagine there are nonstop flights from Ireland to both Orlando (which is inland) or Miami.If you can't go so far, then go May/June."
Cape Verde may be another option... Worth looking into... Turkey may be another option.
Thanks for your advice everyone!!
"Ya, I'll definitely look into Dubai and Cape Verde too. Thanks!Edited: 6:42 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"Will the child be barely one (born yet?), or closer to two? That could make a difference. ALready one isn't really a baby anymore, but a mobile toddler.At the moment, I assume your daughter is either not yet born, or a very young infant. The child's temperament (easy-going and flexible? or falls apart when routine changes?) might help inform the kind of trip you want."
