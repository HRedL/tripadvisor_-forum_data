Doesn't appear to be taking this virus seriously. Other countries have banned people who have travelled through China in last 14 days. Are they putting economy before health of not only tourists but their own residents.
"“as they all look healthy and the tests are expensive” explains it all really, don't trust Indonesia is using worlds best practice."
"Indonesia has found reagent for 2019-nCov detection, even more rich country buy from Indonesia right now.It is not fake news. How about the weather in Bali, Greg? You are always one left behind.https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesian-heal…"
"The article clearly states that Indonesia ""bars all passenger arrivals who have visited China in the past 14 days""There have been no confirmed cases in Indonesia to date. I'm sure Indonesia is taking Coronavirus very seriously despite the potential negative impact it could have on their economy."
"Angelino, ""Country bars all passenger arrivals who have visited China in the past 14 days"", EXCEPT ""243 Indonesian nationals evacuated from WUHAN were not tested on arrival back to Indonesia “as they all look healthy and the tests are expensive”....mmm, not sure what to think?The passenger arrivals who have visited China in the past 14 days, have just shared a plane with people that have not been to China in last 14 days. You can't put it back in the box once it escapes. Hopefully worlds best practice is being followed, whatever that is."
@ShutupGreg.Those 243 people returning from Wuhan have been quarantined for 2 weeks. I've worked with medical professionals in Indonesia and I know they will be very concerned about how their country responds to this. I'm not saying mistakes won't be made.
"I think Sarwa is the Indonesian tourist minister in disguise, I am closely following all posts, as I am only 10 days out, and he seems to have an opinion on every post particularly the virus ones, no virus here is all he says, I have plenty sanitizer ready to go!!!!"
