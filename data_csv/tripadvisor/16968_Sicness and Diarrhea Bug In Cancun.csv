We are going to Beach Palace in early September. We have just heard there is a major stomach bug (poo bug)In Cancun and tourists are dropping like flies with illness. Can anybody that have returned recently dispute or confirm this please. Should we take extra imodium?Thank you.
"What is the source of your information? Of course, it happens, much as it happens to my Mexican friends who travel to the US.Should you need something, no reason to take imodium. Much better at local farmacias."
Press articals in England. Thank you for your time in replying.
Afraid the press in the UK is much like the US press and the press most everywhere. They print articles with nothing to back up their claims. I have seen nothing about any increase in the problem other than what normaly occurs most anywhere.
I'm just back from a 2 weeks stay at Secrets the Vine and had no problems at all. I never witnessed anyone else being ill either.
Please say it isnt so!!
Have you read any posts in the forum regarding sicknessVery little.Have you read the hotel reviews for your hotel??Suggest you practise safe hygiene. Wash hands frequentlyTake some probietics at home (like yogurt)
"Report from Yucatan Times, 5 August 2019...https:/…"
"I see it mentions a PUBIC England health warning!!……..kind of appropriate, don't you think:):)"
"If you are concerned, I suggest seeing your doctor and getting a prescription for Dukoral. You need to take 2 doses before your trip. You are just as likely (if not more likely) to pick up a bug on the plane vs resort."
We just got back from beach palace. No issues at all
"Dukoral is not useful for Cryptosporidium at all which is what this article was about. It has been scientifically proven to be used for CHOLERA only of which there isn't in Mexico. These articles always fascinate me because it us ""only Brits on mass "" that get it, no common hotel or resort and always pushed into media by lawyers and sensationalist British media outlets. No one guarantee you won't get some type of upset stomach - change of environment, excessive alcohol, coconut and sun stroke can cause similar symptoms. If you do catch a bug there are so many different bacterias that can cause it with symptoms of various degrees. The you gave your viruses - I. E. Norvirus just need one person in your proximity and it spreads quickly - not food related at all. So if your that concerned don't go, if you want to go reduce your risk by following universal travelers precautions, don't eat smorgasbords or not freshly prepared foods, hot cooked foods best and even if you do everything right you may still get something but then you may not like I didn't"
My guess we'll never hear about this poster again. #MexicoBadEdited: 1 year ago 
Please watch the sidewalks and local areas for dropping UK tourists. Sounds like an epidemic.
I would double check to see if the source is credible. Read it as very general. I understand your anxiety about it! Safe travels!
"Thank you. I have received a few replies and they are all positive. Thank you for your good wishes,its our first time in Mexico and we are really looking forward to it now."
"I live here and watch and read the news everyday. If it was happening it would be all over the news here. I haven't seen anything at all.We did have an issue a few weeks ago with quite a few cases of food poisoning but this was due mainly to food spoiling in the oppresive heat. That can, and does, happen anywhere. And the situation has been remedied so I don't think you have anything to worry about."
"It's a scam. Called out here.. Very possible OP is in on it.https:/…Google news for British news cyclospora and mexico and the year, and you'll find them every August....https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/241/cycl… This is from 2017 referring to it happening every year since 2015, and obviously this year too! What are the odds. What a joke.Edited: 1 year ago "
