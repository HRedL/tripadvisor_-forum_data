"It’s a rhetorical question, aimed at the couple on Sunday who shouted at us and pointed at the 20mph sign as we rode out of town.Context: we were a group of five middle aged men stopped in Ludlow for tea and ice creams after spending the day riding around Mid Wales and the Brecon Beacons. We are not lunatics, doubt we broke the speed limit all day, just a group of mates on a trip. As we rode through the narrow lanes out of town you came out of your house, pointed at the speed limit sign (we were all travelling at less than 20mph at the time) and shouted “Be quiet” at us. No need, all the bikes are fully road legal and compliant and we were not show boating or making a fuss. We spent the weekend camping at Bishops Castle where we were made very welcome and we spent quite a bit of cash locally. Thanks to you rude and unreasonable response, guess where we will not be visiting/spending money again??"
"I very much doubt that person will be looking an TA!!! You could send a letter to the local paper, www.ludlowadvertiser.co.uk which currently has a story about a rise in residents making complaints about the way fire engines are being driven, enough said!"
You are in the minorityMost motorcyclists are an irresponsible lot who blast about the countryside at well over the speed limit. Its no surprise at the high mortality rate
"A rude and unreasonable response I agree - you have as much right as anyone else to be riding the roads, when compliant with all the rules.But you also have to accept that motorcycles are noisy, and now that so many people are touring rural areas again, you might have been the 100th such irritating disturbance along that road that morning, the straw that broke the camel's back, as it were.I myself live on a 'A' road in rural mid-Wales. So am used to traffic, including the frequent milk tankers and other HGVs. During lockdown the traffic has been so reduced that it has been very, very quiet. Now it is getting back to normal and indeed last weekend was probably the noisiest I have experienced in the 31 years I have lived here. As there are fewer places for people to stop, more people are just out for scenic drives and rides.Sunday morning is usually a quiet time, and I was trying to enjoy a peaceful time in my lounge. On this particular Sunday I was so disturbed by repeated large groups of motorbikes passing that I had to close my window, and eventually gave up and moved to another room.I understand both your wish to ride round our lovely scenery and this couple's irritation. We need to live and let live, but please don't pretend that motorcycles aren't noisy, and noticeably so in an otherwise peaceful context.Edited: 7:23 am, July 28, 2020 "
WarwickshireOldFogey: I have read more ludicrous things on TA but they were written by a Bot. You seem to have pounced on Motorcycle in the post title and then entered the thread just to post abuse. Is this all you've got to do with your time?
"#2 & 3Really? I am a motorcyclist both at work and in my leisure time. Motorcycle exhausts have to comply with the Law, the same as any other vehicle (which is 74 decibels) and it's Illegal to retro fit an exhaust which doesn't.Yes, there are idiotic people out there, but they're not confined to motorcycles. As for the mortality rates, yes, you are more likely to die if you are a motorcyclist, but that's mainly due to the fact that there is a lot less protection, for example, crumple zones. Unfortunately, part of my job is to attend RTCs, and, of the fatal ones, over 70% were caused by the actions of The drivers of other vehicles, not the motorcyclist."
"I posted the title to the thread as a rhetorical question, I fail to see how I have been abusive! I was commenting on the fact that as law abiding motorcyclists we stopped in Ludlow to enjoy the beauty of the town and spend a little cash locally. My point is that the reception we received was unwelcoming and contrasted strongly with Bishops Castle, Montgomery, Church Stratton and several other towns. I appreciate that as motorcyclists we are in a minority and that some of us can be anti social. I can do without those myself but in no way did we fall into that category. I might be over reacting but this was the first time in 30 years riding that I have encountered this response myself!!"
"Gregory,The comment about abusive wasn't aimed at you, but at post #2."
"I don't think it's worth getting upset, nor do I think it's worth avoiding anywhere just because there's a couple of people you came across that you didn't like.Carry on obeying the law, being polite and responsible and don't worry about things that don't matter that much."
"Yes, you are right. It just came as a bit of a surprise!"
"A single, legally exhausted M-bike is no noisier than any car.A group of 5 of the same (which take up less road space than 5 cars) may seem noisier! Think of The Doppler Effect!Don't be disheartened! Carry on in your sensible way like me and my biker mates do!"
"Not disheartened, I’ve been doing this for many years but I was surprised and disappointed at the reaction."
>>> I might be over reacting but this was the first time in 30 years riding that I have encountered this response myself!! <<<There's no might about it. You are going to avoid an entire town because 2 people shouted at you and pointed to a road sign ? Come on you can rise above that surely ?
I wouldn't avoid it - I'd get a bikers rally going and take them all there!
#10 “no noisier than any car”It’s noisier than my Nissan Leaf... :-)
"ah but the new rules say noiseless battery cars are dangerous for pedestrians who don't look so in future they will have to make a noise at town speeds. Which gives me a wicked idea, since the noise will be electronically generated it could be a motor bike engine!!!"
"It already does make a noise, although technically at the moment I can turn it off. More like a whistle, and still quieter than a motorbike..."
"Yes, of course you are right and of course I can but at the time it was rude and unnecessary."
"== doubt we broke the speed limit all day, just a group of mates on a trip.==... but it reads that you broke the Coronavirus rules in Wales.https://gov.wales/guidance-extended-househol…"
