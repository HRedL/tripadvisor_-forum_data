I just read that Cuba is experiencing a Cholera outbreak. Does anyone have any information on how this is affecting Havana? I understand this is the first epidemic since 1959.
"Living here in Havana I have found most up to date info online, Nothing is really ever communicated here on the news..Check out this up to date report..huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/cuba-cholera-o…Edited: 8 years ago "
"There's a big difference between an outbreak and an epidemic, but for scaremongering the latter works best. In any case, there are several threads on this already.As for affecting Havana the latest I heard was one confirmed case. That's pretty far from an epidemic. Let's hope they can put this down fast."
ProMED has an update today:www.promedmail.org/direct.php…I consider them to be a reliable source.Edited: 8 years ago 
Keep an eye out for a CNN report.
"Good link, eeefarm.Generally I double anything the government says then cut in half whatever the dissidents say and you usually end up with a fairly accurate sense of the real situation.No matter what though the present situation couldn't be termed an epidemic by any measure. Go next door to Haiti to see a truly classic tragedy...Cheers,Terry"
"Epidemiology 101... actually, the terms 'outbreak' and 'epidemic' are essentially synonymous. People tend to perceive the latter to imply something more severe or widespread, but that's false. Anything above the normal baseline level of a disease is defined as an ""epidemic"" - so for very rare diseases where the baseline rate is zero, then indeed 1 case is an epidemic. For more common diseases, a much larger number of cases would have to occur to be called an epidemic. The term 'epidemic' does not inherrently imply a huge number of cases, although many people believe that is what it means. Class dismissed. :)"
"Common Sense 101:........An “outbreak” and an “epidemic” essentially mean the same thing to an epidemiologist, but the term “epidemic” has a more serious connotation than “outbreak” and is used less frequently to avoid the perception of a crisis situation."
"canada has cholera, too! contaminated water will do that. carol e."
"#7 copied & pasted directly from about.com... should cite source.Pretty much says what I said regardless - I said people perceive (ie. connotation) that epidemic is worse. But it's an incorrect perception. Nothing wrong with educating people to the real meanings, which were correctly used relativey interchangeably by the OP."
"""Pretty much says what I said regardless ...""In your opinion - not mine."
"#8 cubacarol: Cholera cases are very rare in Canada, although they do occur (e.g. about 1 case per year in Ontario according to Ministry of Health&LTC) - but universally these cases are imported from travel to other countries. Cholera eradicated in Canada in early 1900s with sewage treatment etc."
"REGIME APOLOGIST work hard on this forum to twist facts and trump up travel to Cuba. The Cholera problem started in Cuba in mid June, those who reported the problem have been fired from the hospital. GRANMA reports half the story in July and since been hush hush. The regime apologist on this site are BULLIES and don't care about our health."
Are you for real?
CubaJack:I'm just wondering if the poster is Miami based?
I'm heading for Varadero in less than 4 weeks and I'm keeping an open mind on this subject for the time being but from over here on the fence and having read numerous posts on this subject I can see where sunandfun is coming from.
"Kendo, don't get fooled. Sunandfun has just joined this week to stir up a lot of anti-Cuban rhetoric. It's all politically motivated, which by the way is against the forum guidelines. But please, don't anybody report any of his posts. It's important to understand what kind of people we have in this world."
"Anybody who thinks it is only certain regimes that ""manage"" information hasn't had much experience living in so called free countries, or in Toronto during the SARS crisis, for that matter. Yeah, that's a political statement. I had inside info during that time in Toronto, and know what was.......and what wasn't......being admitted publicly."
Canada has issued a travel advisory re Cuba and Choleracbc.ca/news/…cuba-cholera.html
"There seems to be an ""outbreak"" of the likes of Sunandfun.New sign ups with an agenda. They are likely one in the same person.Would any of you be named Peter Perez?"
"Here is CNN's Patrick Oppmann reporting on the ""outbreak"".dailymotion.com/video/xs58lo_cuba-deals-with…"
"Thanks Senor, that report gives a much clearer picture of the problem."
"""Would any of you be named Peter Perez?""Wow - S_R ...there's a blast from the past!""But for others, as Albor Ruiz writes this week in the New York Daily News, the cholera outbreak has become ""a propaganda exercise for those who, even after 53 years of a failed economic embargo, prefer a policy of hostility and isolation over one of dialogue and engagement.""http://cubacentral.wordpress.com/Edited: 8 years ago "

"Reuters - 22 minutes agoreuters.com/article/2012/07/14/cuba-cholera-…Cuba says cholera outbreak not spreadingSat Jul 14, 2012 1:33pm EDT * Outbreak has not spread* Some 158 cases, three deaths reported* Health Ministry says new cases decliningBy Marc FrankHavana, July 14 (Reuters) - Cuba said on Saturday that a cholera outbreak in eastern Cuba is diminishing and has not spread to other parts of the country.A Public Health Ministry statement said there were 158 confirmed cholera cases and three people had died since the illness was first detected in Manzanillo, a city of 130,000 residents located on the southern coast of Granma province.""The outbreak of cases transmitted through water is diminishing, with no indication the illness has spread through food or other means,"" Saturday's Health Ministry statement said.""Isolated cases have been diagnosed in other parts of the country in people coming from Manzanillo. There is no spread of this epidemic,"" it said.Cuban authorities first reported the outbreak on July 3, stating there were 53 cases and three deaths at the time.Manzanillo residents, especially those who live on the outskirts of town, rely on wells and latrines that flooded in June due to heavy rainfall, contaminating water and causing thousands of cases of severe diarrhea, of which some proved to be cholera.Cholera, a bacteria that quickly spreads through contaminated water, is generally not fatal but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration, especially among the elderly.While residents in Granma province have been kept informed through radio and television as the government moved to limit the outbreak, national authorities remained mum after the July 3 statement, fueling rumors of a national epidemic.A number of countries, including Cuba's biggest tourism provider, Canada, have posted travel warnings.The United Nations says Cuba has one of the best preventive health care systems in the developing world and it has ample experience battling cholera in Haiti, where hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade and a cholera outbreak has killed more than 7,000 people since that country's 2010 earthquake.

"Thanks for the update, CubaJack."
"And from Cuba itselfEl pasado 2 de julio, el Ministerio de Salud Pública informó la presencia de un brote de enfermos de cólera en el municipio de Manzanillo, provincia de Granma. Desde entonces, a través de las emisoras de radio y televisión del territorio, se mantiene informada a la población sobre la evolución de la situación epidemiológica y en especial, las medidas preventivas e higiénicas a cumplir. Hasta el momento, existen un total de 158 personas que a partir de la valoración clínica, epidemiológica y por cultivo de laboratorio, se le ha confirmado la presencia del Vibrio Cholerae O1 Tor enterotoxigénico, serotipo Ogawa. No han ocurrido nuevos fallecidos, manteniéndose la cifra de tres adultos como se había informado. Las medidas tomadas han posibilitado que el brote epidémico de transmisión hídrica, se encuentre disminuyendo, sin evidencia de propagación de la enfermedad por alimentos u otra vía. Como resultado del sistema de vigilancia epidemiológica sobre enfermedades diarreicas agudas propias del verano, se han diagnosticado casos aislados en otras regiones del país, de personas que se infectaron en Manzanillo, siendo tratados y estudiados oportunamente, no existiendo diseminación de este brote epidémico. Ante esta situación epidemiológica, participan de forma cohesionada los organismos y entidades implicados para el análisis sistemático y la adopción de las medidas que se requieran, garantizándose agua potable clorada en la zona afectada, acciones de saneamiento e higienización, así como el desarrollo de una amplia campaña educativa con la población, que ha cooperado en todo momento, en el cumplimiento de las indicaciones sanitarias dadas. Se reitera la necesidad de intensificar las medidas higiénicas, especialmente las relacionadas con el lavado de las manos, la ingestión de agua de calidad o hervida domésticamente, la limpieza y cocción adecuadas de los alimentos, aspectos estos imprescindibles en esta etapa de verano. Ministerio de Salud Pública 13 de julio de 2012 ""Año 54 de la Revolución"""
I have a limited understanding of Spanish.Is this quote available in English?Irie
Ingles por favor.
Just go with the Reuters report which is completely based on the actual government notice anyway.I posted this so people who can read spanish could see where Reuters was derived from.
"Is the Reuters report (derived from the one you quoted) different ? If so, I'd like to see those differences. Can you share them?"
"Thanks one and all for your valuable information.CubaJack, I especially appreciated the Reuters Report. Very informative!"
