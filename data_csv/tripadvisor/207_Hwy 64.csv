Whats the latest on hwy 64?
Keep up to date on the GCNP website:https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand…East entrance is still closed. Must use south entrance. Hwy 64 inside the park is only open part way.

"Does anyone know when they plan to open this? I'm coming from Moab so it will be 2 hour detour just to avoid this 50 mile section! I'm also not sure what the covid risk is from driving on this 50 mile stretch of road in a private car, especially since it will force me to take a longer drive."

"Post #4 - be aware of the extensive lockdown (also called a curfew) on the Navajo Nation. There may not be any place to ""stop"" so your risk will be just being in your car. The restrictions include grocery stores and gas stations so make sure you have food and fuel before entering the reservation. The curfew/lockdown changed last night and may change again so you should keep tabs on what is happening. Avoid traveling on the weekend when the most extensive portion of the curfew occurs. The NN curfews/lockdown will be at least until the end of August when the current order expires but keep in mind that the NN has continuously had stricter stay at home orders than the surrounding states and did not decrease the measures even when restrictions decreased in surrounding states.  I find it hard to believe that East Entrance for the GCNP will open as long as the NN has their lockdown and travel restrictions in place. I would definitely count on the detour to Flagstaff and entering the South Gate. If by some chance the NN re-opens in a couple of months, then look at it as a bonus."
