Struggling to find clear guidance on this..I hope to return to the UK in the next few weeks with transit in Dubai.Australia is exempt from quarantine but Dubai is not!Will I therefore have to self Isolate for 2 weeks upon arrival?Any links to guidance on this would be appreciated..
"Similar question was asked yesterday, but for Qatar. The answer in that one (reply #6) appears to be that you would need to quarantine.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…"
"Arghhhhh..OK, thanks so much for the hint about the other post - I missed that!"
"Would undergo a Covid-19 test not exempt you from self-isolation?https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors""These can include a requirement to self-isolate, quarantine, or undergo testing for coronavirus, or ...."""
It's likely that if you just transit Dubai then you won't have to quarantine. Things may change by the time of your flight though.
Post #3 The advice you quote from your link is advice to travellers from the UK going elsewhere. There's absolutely no advice from the UK government about tests when entering the UK. A covid test is not an alternative to self isolation.
"The UK government does not provide COVID-19 tests to people arriving in the UK, unless they are displaying clear symptoms. Maybe they should, but really, they don't. If you arrive from a country not on the ""safe"" list, you must self-isolate. Now whether arriving from a safe-listed country via transit in a not-safe one counts, I'm not sure."
"As far as I know people travelling to the UK via Singapore transit, do not have to quarantine....If you stay airside in Dubai, then I think you'd be ok, but it's not clear."
