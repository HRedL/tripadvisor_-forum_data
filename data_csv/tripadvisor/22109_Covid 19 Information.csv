"Please can I make a suggestion to keep the forums as free as possible from fake news, scaremongering etc?Would everyone when posting news items or information please include the link to the source of that information. If possible the original source or if taken from other groups and forums a link to the article as it appeared. There are so many “I’ve read” or “Someone said” posts going around (not just on TA but other social media platforms or travel forums) that so those reading can check the authenticity of the the post.
