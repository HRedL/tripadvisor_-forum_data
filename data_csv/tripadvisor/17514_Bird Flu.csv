"So did anyone see the article on the bird flu this morning. Saying that the U.S may implement travel restrictions if they feel it is needed.news.yahoo.com/newsâ€¦This is the article I read. I don't think it will happen, but I just thought it was interesting. I didn't think the country had the right to restrict travel. Maybe its just me but I think everyone is taking this thing too far. So I was just wondering what everybody's take is on this? Does anybody think this sounds rational? Also, what would you think if the U.S (or any country for that matter) restricted your travel because of the flu?"
"Christin: Yeah, I saw that article. And I think most people are just hoping the pandemic doesn't happen. I can't imagine that restricting travel would be a good thing for the world economy. And do I think it's rational? No way."
"I think that if I see one more newscast or photo showing people hanging chickens upside down by their feet, or throwing them into big burlap bags, I am going to scream. They may be raised to be eaten and they may be becoming ill, but they don't deserve to be treated like that. There, I feel better. "
"I agree! I am not an animal rights person, but they are killing some of these birds just because they suspect they might have the flu. I would be so ticked if they were to decide that I couldn't travel because there was a ""chance"" of me catching the flu and then spreading it. I think I will just take my chances. I hate being told what I can't do."
"I think that there has been toomuch use of scare tactics. only 100 people have died to date from this so it isn't a human pandemic yet. Also, humans can't pass it to other humans yet.I think the US would be way out of line to restrict travel for this. There is too much big government in this country already. Maybe the government should stop trying to dictate our lives and actually do something in DC. Sorry for the rant but I am sick and tired of all of our politicians."
"I heard about H5N1 from the medical and scientific communities before the politicians started talking about it. I believe it is very alarming, to say the least. Quarantining to prevent spread of disease is nothing new. I would think they would be remiss in not implementing such methods should the situation arise. People should be prepared by having extra food, water and personal items on hand. Try to stay as healthy as you can by eating right and exercising.My biggest fear is trusting the government we have now to manage it all. "
"Scare mongering, that's what it is.I won't go into my views on the administration suffice it to say they need something to take the heat off their other little problems."
"Dear collegetrekker, if you visit a questionable locale and come down with bird flu, I pray on the lives of my grandchildren that you're quarantined -- in that questionable locale. CVG is my second-most frequented airport after my home port. For those who don't know, CVG is in northern Kentucky and my grandkids are right across the border. Watch a family member die because of someone else's ""right"" to do whatever the heck they please and you might change your opinion.Now, do I think the media are flogging this thing to scare the wits out of us? Yes. Do I think they are doing their best to make the administration seem inept and incompetent (on both sides of the pond)? Of course. But that doesn't mean a lethal, easily transmittable new disease doesn't bear watching."
"A couple of weeks ago there was some hysteria here about a plane possibly having someone with the bird flu on it and they were talking about quarantining the people on board at the Los Angeles Forum, as if they hadn't already learned enough from the travesty at the Louisiana Superdome. Having said that, for the first time in my 30 years of existence, I had a flu shot and a tetanus shot, last week in preparation for my December trip to London. "
"Remember the great SARS epidemic that was going to kill millions? According to the WHO total deaths worldwide were 142, almost exactly the number of deaths on the roads in the US in an average day."
"And during the SARS outbreak, several countries were refusing entry to any passengers who had recently been in a country with SARS cases. They never said you couldn't go, you just can't come back!"
"For my family the not being given any info by Defra etc on how best to protect our chooks from catching it is hard - the thought of guys in white boiler suits turning up at our front door wanting to murder the family pets on the off chance they may be ill is really upsetting my kids, they're totally gutted and terrified every time there's anything on the news waiting for the first confirmed cases in our area.There is NO info for people with pet chooks - are we supposed to get the flu shot?! Should we keep our little feathery fluff balls inside - no one can tell us anything. It's a case of wait and see if they get ill and then we'll kill them for you. Personally I'd rather be given info on how to prevent them from catching it in the first place! :0)"
"Isn't there a vaccine for birds to prevent them from getting this deadly type of bird flu? I believe I read there is, but WHY don't they use it? Is it not practical to try and vaccinate fowl, do they not have a way to spread a vaccine that will be eaten by wild birds, does it just cost to much??"
"Thanks for the new word, Traveltramp. Had to google ""chook"". What a cute word for a chicken."
"Chook. Never heard it before. I means chicken, huh? Or is it a particular kind of chicken? How is it pronounced? Like foot or like shoot?"
"Hi, chook - pronounced chuck!just a general term for any chicken like bunny is another name for a rabbit etc, just a bit more affectionate.There is a vaccine and yes it is very expensive - we would more than happily pay infact my children are more than happy to forego Christmas to pay for the shots but, although they would stop our chooks getting ill it wouldn't actually stop them catching the bird flu or passing it on. They just wouldn't get ill themselves - this means they would still be culled or murdered as my kiddies insist. :0)"
"First of all - pandemic flu isn't the same as SARS. SARS turned out to be a relative non-event.There have been, on average, 3 flu pandemics every century for the past few hundred years. They have ranged from relatively mild to extremely severe. Quarantine doesn't make sense with flu because people shed virus, and are therefore communicable, for up to 24 hours before becoming symptomatic. Plus, the incubation period is short (2-4 days, whereas SARS was 10 days). There are also likely to be people who become infected and exhibit absolutly no symptoms. So one can institute quarantine but still have highly communicable, but not detectable disease spreaders running around."
"Does this mean we should toss out the Thanksgiving Turkey too?I ordered a supply of Tamiflu because I am travelling to Canada in a couple of weeks. Who knows? I may not be allowed to come back but at least my symptoms will be under control, maybe. :-)If there is a vaccine to prevent the Avian flu, I am certain that many would be happy to pay the price (no matter how high) in order to protect members of their family. Who makes the vaccine?"
"The vaccine for avian flu isn't for people it's for the birds!They can't make a vaccine for people until people actually have it in your country because in mutates so will be different maybe in different countries apparently. The problem it would appear occurs when someone with human flu also catches avian flu - it is then thought the 2 will merge, this is the main problem!:0)"
"TravelT - But how on earth can you vaccinate ALL the birds? It would be impossible. Yes, you can vaccinate the domestic birds that are raised or kept as pets but what do you do with the wild birds?I am not exactly sure how the wild birds transmit this flu to domestic birds. Perhaps you know a little more about this.The mutation part makes sense. How would we know what form it would take so how can one prevent it from developing in humans. Thanks for the enlightement. Now I feel dumb. :-("
"The whole bird flu reminds me of mad cow disease or chronic wasting disease. I know places in the US where many heads of cattle were destroyed to prevent the spread of CWD. I know the goal is to prevent it from spreading, but cattle farmers can't afford to have their entire herd put down. There definitely needs to be more research going into these problems to prevent them from occuring, not just slaughtering animals when they are suspected of being sick. I have not been terribly concerned about catching bird flu. Perhaps I should be, but the media or whoever is always getting us upset about something. I still laugh when I think about Y2K."
"yep, catching bird flu in itself isn't so much of a problem(not nice but not a certain death warrent)it seems to only become a *big* problem if the 2 combine! The biggest threat to our domestic birds comes from contaminated droppings from infected wild birds. They are apparently looking into some sort of possible vaccination programme for rare or endangered wild species - not exactly sure how they propose to do this and the vaccine only stops the birds getting ill but they still catch it and transmit it. If my chooks would have to be killed if they cought flu vaccinated or not then what is the justification for vaccinating the rare/endangered birds - wouldn't they still have to be culled?!I'm confused!For the average bod on the street catching avian flu is really really remote, it's really only when you are in very close proximity to infected birds that you have more of a problem. We have seperate footwear and disinfect - we practised good hygiene anyway hand washing with anti bacterial wash etc everytime we handled anything to do with the chooks so I think so far we are doing all the right things but who knows.But I wouldn't worry too much.:0)"
"The problem is not so much that human flu and bird flu will combine, but that the bird flu will mutate into a form which makes it easily transmissable between humans, which it isn't at present. This is what happened with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Also, the only people at risk of catching bird flu (directly from birds, you can't catch from other humans) are people in close proximity to them, ie who farm them, handle them or have them as pets. Also, flu vaccinations will only protect against previous, known strains of influenza, not H5N1. "
"BTW I also meant to say, that to be honest there's little the US can do once the next flu pandemic starts. Travel restriction will make no difference, as a previous poster said the incubation time is very short and you are infectious before symptoms appear. It's better to have good hygiene as more virus is shed through tears foe example than coughing and also through dirty hands. The SARS epidemic spread initially from a hotel, where the infected person touched a lift button and everyone else who subsequently touched the button became infected."
"What worries me is not the fact the the chucks and ducks might catch it as these tend to be captive birds and man can take action to control the spread.Its places like Trafalga Square and St Marks square with its thousands of feral pigeons which are effectivly wild, in combination with thousands of visitors from all over the world that give me the jitters.As these places and many more have visitors from arround the world Feeding them, comming into direct contact with the live birds and their droppings. Just imagin what could happen if the flock in Trafalga square were to become infected.The worlds airlines could spread this into almost every country in the world within 48 hours. almost before it had been positivly identified.My question; Who in control of these flocks of birds?????????? "
"Have any of the scaremongerers mentioned the culling of pidgeons, I think not.XR759, I see you are in Donny!"
"Isn't it already illegal to feed pigeons in Trafalgar Sq? When I was there, it didn't look anything like previous photos I had seen, there were only a dozen or so, doing their own thing. "
Donald Duck is the latest casualty at Disneyland Paris. Alas Poor Donald....We knew him well.There must be a reason why these Flu Strains only appear to emanate from the Far East. 
"Anemone; Not actually in Donny,a bit like London Heathrow, but it is my postal address.Do you know the town where the fastest steam engin in the world was built, along with many of its stable mates"
This is a little off topic.The Mallard was built in Donny along with the Flying Scotsman and others.The Mallard broke the steam speed record at 12 mph in 1938 the record would not be broken in England again till the 70s.The Mallard is a beautiful streamlined 'mallard' blue engine which lives at the National Railway Museum in York.www.nrm.org.uk
slight typing error.. 126 Mph
"whilst I aggree it is a bit of this topic The National Railway Musuam at York is a site visitors from over seas should not miss if they are in the locality And best of all you can see this wonderfull collection for ""Free"". Many of which still steam and go out on the line including Mallard"
Talking of which I read in the paper today that the Museum has applied for planning permission to build a 197 feet high big wheel to rival the London Eye.
