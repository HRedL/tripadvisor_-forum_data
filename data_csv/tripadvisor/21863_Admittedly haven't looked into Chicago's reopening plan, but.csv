"I'm looking to get there this summer for a couple of nights. Been to Chicago several times, haven't done everything yet, but these are the must-dos, and want to know when locals think I could do this. TIA1. Architecture Boat Tour - First Lady: short on any details on their website.2. Hang out at the new Starbucks Roastery.3. And of course, eat inside at a Lou Malnati's.4.. Eat inside at Portillos."
"#2,3 & 4 should be possible sometime in June, with masks, capacity limits and social distancing, etc., etc. We are awaiting our mayor to announce her plans for restaurants and bars.Dunno about boat tours. They likely do not make economic sense with small groups, so would have to wait for a later phase of the re-opening. I would not be surprised to see them delayed until 2021, along with live theater and concerts."
Ask again in June. Everything is still closed and we have no date to start to reopen. Maybe think about coming around Labor Day.
"Chicago will open behind the rest of the State. Phase 3 should be next week: All gatherings of 10 people or fewer are allowedBARS & RESTAURANTSOpen for delivery, pickup, drive through. Restaurants will also be allowed to open outdoor seating in this phase for parties of six or fewer. Social distancing requirements still in place, meaning tables should be six feet apart from one another and from sidewalks, masks and distancing measures will be required for staff and other precautions.Outdoor seating includes areas located on the rooftop of a building or within establishment with retractable roof. The roof should remain open during hours of operation of outdoor dining and/or drinking). It can also include outdoor space connected to or located on the site of a restaurant, grocery store, health or fitness center, hotel, golf club, or other social club with a food establishment license. Indoor space where 50% or more of a wall can be removed via the opening of windows, doors, or panels provided that dining tables are within 8 feet from such opening will also be allowed along with any other outdoor dining and drinking areas authorized by local governments provided that food and drinks are prepared by licensed food or liquor establishments and that proper social distancing of 6 feet between designated customer tables and other seating areas. There will be NO inside dining.Since Boat Cruises, Starbucks or Street dining is not necessary I would wait until next year.Edited: 5:28 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"But our mayor has announced she considers (limited) inside dining to be necessary, so she is working on plans for that, presumably sooner than Labor Day.But, as noted, stay tuned for developments."
"Hope the boat tours can continue in some capacity this summer. Just wondering how a Lou Malnati's would operate? I remember the one on State Street didn't take reservations, so there was an hour wait when I went. Will restaurants have to implement a reservation system for limited seating? Seems having people wait several hours is counter-productive to the goal of social distancing."
"Inside dining isn't until Phase 4. Chicago enters Phase 3 middle of June(ish). Phase 4 would happen well beyond that so like others have said if you want to do the things on your list which are mostly inside dining and a boat full of people. Hope for late summer plan for fall and possibly beyond.B,"

People will have to wait off site for dining.
"Your “Must Dos” of hanging out at Starbucks and eating inside at a pizza joint or hotdog restaurant are probably not on a Chicagoans wish list right now. We’d rather have our Lakefront open, concerts in the park and stadiums, neighborhood street festivals and parades, ethnic restaurants, fine dining, the Lincoln Park Zoo; maybe just cocktails & canapés at home with 25 of our closest friends or a mean card game for four, maybe just walking crowded downtown sidewalks again. You may have to enjoy your “must haves” back home in Ohio this year. Hopefully they’ll still be here next year.Edited: 10:08 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"Oh, I forgot: Get a haircut and have our glorious museums open again.Edited: 11:53 pm, May 26, 2020 "
I would take a pass on Chicago this summer. Who knows what will or won’t be open. Lou Malnati’s you can order on line. I think some of Portellos too. Come when you can really enjoy our City & all it has to offer.
Phase 3 begins on June 3rd = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"Lollapalooza, Taste of Chicago, other summer festivals canceled by cityhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment…"
Navy Pier has a partial opening today (June 10). No entry into buildings but the sidewalks are open and outdoor dining under social spacing will happen. Some tour boats are expected to open. Rides will not reopen until phase 4. Weekly Fireworks are cancelled.
"First Lady boat tours will be going by the end of June (tentative date: 6/26). There will be fewer departures than ""normal""; not all the volunteers will be available. Boats will not run at capacity, so as to allow social distancing on board; family groups will sit together but otherwise empty seats will separate people. Guests will be asked to wear masks."
