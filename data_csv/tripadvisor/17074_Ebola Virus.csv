We have a trip planned to Kenya and Tanzania for late 2015. Seeing all the scary news on the spread of the Ebola Virus is concerning. How realistic is the threat of it spreading to Kenya and Tanzania? Should we be worried about our trip at the end of the year next year?
"Off the top of my head, I'd suggest you look at a map. Anything is possible, but the outbreak is in west Africa. Look at the map and see how really far that is.I'm not blowing you off, I went through this with my mom. She's petrified for my next trip. It's just a damned long way from West to East.chris"
"This is bound to come up but your trip is more than a year away. They will work darn hard to isolate the current situation. To date, there has never been a case in Tanzania and only one suspected case in Nairobi, and that was a person who arrived by plane.....in 2011. This is the time to turn off the TV and do some legitimate research via websites like World Health Organization. Educate yourself, don't fall pray to sensationalism. The news will sensationalize everything. There is no denying this is a sorry state right now, and the loss of some of the leading medics in the disease is distressing, but worrying now for your trip will only cause undue stress. Take out good cancellation insurance if you are really concerned and be religious about hand washing while there...it helps avoid many illnesses.Like so many concerns, yes, things might happen in a country, but the risks to tourists are extremely minimal. I blame the government websites that send out alerts every time an African gets a fever. It creates a constant state of fever....not readiness.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Unfortunately there is no crystal ball. Read the expert opinion such as CDC , WHO & Drs without Boarders. They don't know what is going to happen next week, let alone next year. All we can do is watch and wait and make a personal decision based upon credible evidence & the facts. As wonderful as trip advsior is, nobody here can tell you whats going to happen. All we know is that its the biggest outbreak ever recorded, its located in West Africa and it is not under control at the moment. At least you have plenty of time on your hands. I'm in the same position as I imagine a lot of people are, but I have paid a lot of money to an agent for our trip in December this year. My decision is to wait and see for a few more months before I decide to cancel. If the perceived risk becomes too high in my mind, then so be it."
"Cbradley is right, i also heard is in west Africa, Nigeria or something, Not East Africa.Good lucky."
There have been recent cases in Uganda too. these latest ones are about as far as you can get from East Africa and still be in Africa. You asked this on the Kenyan forum too. The answer is nobody really knows.If you are so worried cancel the trip!
"If you really want to safeguard yourself in this, make certain that you have a way to get back to wherever you live, quickly (you don't say in your profile where you are from). Once back in your own environment you will be treated well. The problem why it kills almost everyone in Africa is that they don't have facilities to treat this the way it should be treated, thus, the people die. With proper treatment people recover from this.And your trip is scheduled for a long time from now, it will most probably be over by then; but like others have said, who can know for certain.I have a friend who was scheduled to go to Sierra Leone now, and I told him he should stay home until this works it's way done."
"Am sure that by next year this will be on the back burner and we'll be concerned about some other whatever. Right now remembr this is not air-borne, rather by intimate contact with an infected indviduals' bodily fluids. This is much the same as the initial panic when HIV/AIDS was first detected back in the early/mid-80s. I sure wouldn't worry about what might be in 2015. But be sure to have Trip Insurance to cover 'for any reason.'"
Princess.<rather by intimate contact with an infected indviduals' bodily fluids > Not strictly true. Even mourners at funerals can be infected if they touch the body.
"As the trip is late 2015 I wouldn't start to worry yet and in any event make sure you have travel insurance, and medical evacuation insurance."
"It recently spread from one country to another by an infected person getting on a plane.Call me simple, but that person could have gotten on a plane to the US or UK, to pluck examples out of the air.Would people planning a trip to those countries in 2015 be cancelling them now? I think not."
"The reason the disease is spreading so quickly in the countries where currently infected - custom is that the family cleans the deceased body including orifices and thus Ebola is spread from one to another. That's intimate contact. Trying to get customs changed regardless the terrible outcome isn't all that easy. Breathing the air doesn't do it, but for that matter who knows what else is in the air of a plane that could spread other diseases. Interesting to notice just half-hour ago that the doctor who had contracted Ebola just returned to the US for treatment was actually able to get out of the ambulance on his own and walked into the hospital. A good sign, so let's pray for him. The plane is now heading back to Africa to pick-up the other person which was initially thought to be the first to return, but she insisted the male doc do so as he was in worse condition."
"We are scheduled for Tanzania Sept 11 - 18 this year. Nervous but Tanzania is 3500 miles from West Coast. Thinking we should be fine but, of course, if things change we may change our mind. Reading fine print of Travel insurance and looks like only covered if areas are quarantined or flights cancelled. Karl what are you suggestions for making sure we can get out. That is one of our concerns. Any advise greatly appreciated."
"If once in country and you feel the need to get out, whether insurance will pay or not, and as long as flights are departing... you change arrangements and up-and-away! If the situation is all that serious and you're concerned you do what you have to!"
TZ may be 3500 miles from Sierra Leone but from Sierra Leone to East coast USA is only 500 more. I think you will be safe either way.
"Ebola is something you can control whether you get. It is not spread via air or breathing. Only through direct contact with infected fluids and then has to be exposed to open sores, mouth, eyes or mucous membranes. It is transmitted the way that AIDS or Hep C is transmitted (although more contagious). You could walk through a room of 20 infected people without catching it. Even touching them (although I wouldn't recommend). It is not ""in the air"" or ""on their skin.""I am headed back on August 20th. I have 2-3 people everyday tell me I should not go due to the Ebola. I explain what I just wrote or what Mfuwe wrote. Where I live is almost as close to the Ebola outbreak as being in Tanzania. Besides, I have an infected patient with Ebola only 200 miles from me right now (In Atlanta).I understand your concern, but it is truly unfounded from an Ebola standpoint. I would worry much more about Malaria.An interesting post a few months back put it all in reference. It explained that Africa is the size of North America, South America, Australia, and Europe- ALL PUT TOGETHER. Not going to Tanzania due to Ebola on the west coast is like saying I wouldn't visit Miami because there is an outbreak in San Seattle. Just a point of reference."
You must have misunderstood my concern. My concern is things taking a turn while there and the fear of not being able to get out.
"Ilex, you have added to an existing thread with a different focus. Perhaps others are answering the OP. But, I will answer your concern. Often these events are regionalized or isolated. This particular situation has become more widespread. My experience is that tour groups and TOs do not want their clients in bad places and have their ears to the ground. You can request updates from your driver and TO and make departure decisions if the need arises.Where the difficulty might be is if you fall into a quarantined area and this is highly unlikely for the average safari traveler. If your itinerary includes Zanzibar, then you are on an island with less access to get back to the mainland for evacuation. This may increase the evacuation challenge, but you will have an update before even getting there as to any movement of the disease into Tanz. If by some unforseen circumstance you need to evacuate, I might be more inclined to move to the next unaffected country and fly from there.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I'm sorry, I did misunderstand. I apologize. However, understand that the CDC knows very well those things I mentioned. They will not create a panic for all of Africa. I think you will be safe and have nothing to worry about. They will not condemn an entire continent of a billion people. Even now, people are able to fly from Sierra Leone to the US. Screening is done, then they are allowed to enter. In the western world, this is a relatively easy virus to contain. Sorry that I did not understand your concern."
We have a trip to Zanzibar on 7th og August. Is there any risk?
We have booked for safari at Masai Mara during 6th Sep to 12th Sep. We will stay at Nairobi one night. Will there be a positive turn on this crisis by then? Can we proceed with our tour? what's your suggestions?
"Melisa, uni_archana, folks, please remember, this is a travel forum and though combined we have knowledge, I don't think any of us have crystal balls to foresee the future. Most of us actually don't live in Tanzania either, so we can try to allay concern, we will only know as much about the spread of this as you...by self educating. Ensure you have insurance and keep you ear to the ground. Read this entire thread for responses and perhaps they will put your mind at rest, or from further reading you can make an informed decision."
Thanks for the comments. My head says we should be able to get out but my gut is worried. I know it should be fine but thinking of every possible scenario so we don't get caught off guard. We will be on private safari and will not be going to Zanzibar.
"Ilex, I understand the concerns. It seems that for many reasons, travel has become risky business...and really, it doesn't matter whether it is Antarctica, safari or Boston for marathons - there can be risks. I have learned to work with this and allay my family's fears for their globetrotting mother by reading and self educating and then keeping them informed. Keep your ear to the ground and also, keep in communication with your TO. But don't limit your reading to the newspaper. There is more sensationalism than fact there....and turn off the TV :-)"
"Being in a remote region, with few people around - to me, that would be positive in these circumstances. Flying in snd out of remote safari sites is an everyday event there, too, so that should be reassuring.I agree with quilting mama. But you have to make your own decisions."
Last time I looked Nairbi and Maasai Mara were in Kenya. This is the Tanzanian forum. Neither country has any cases of Ebola Virus. What crisis?
"Ebola is contracted through blood and feces, or bodily fluids, so it's pretty hard to come in direct contact unless you're a doctor, nurse, or caring for a sick person. With just 1-2 cases in East Africa, you carry the same chances as contracting AIDS. Hopefully that gives some perspective."
"katesiobhan.Ebola can be contracted through handshakes and even sharing towels. It is NOT like AIDS in that respect.And just 1 or 2 cases in East Africa? There have been three outbreaks in Uganda this millennium. The latest in 2012 claimed 14 victims. The worst, in 2000, killed 425.If people are going to speculate and advise then at least get the facts right.And seeing how Uganda is so close to Tanzania and Kenya I am appalled at the apparent panic that an outbreak some 3000 miles away in west Africa is currently stirring up when East African tourism in 2000/2012 barely noticed when it was right next door!Come on folks. You are quite safe."
"Mfuwe, let's revisit Stephen the doctor's comment <<Only through direct contact with infected fluids and then has to be exposed to open sores, mouth, eyes or mucous membranes>> so yes, possibly by handshake, but only if open sores on hands; and towels, because it would be in contact with some mucous membranes....so in this respect, some would consider the transmission similar to AIDS. Regardless, the fear is incited by media and needs to be put into perspective."
"ER I don't think so Mama. Unsullied but unprotected hand in exposed contact and then one inadvertently wipes one's brow, or worse in mouth or....!And, yes the present problem is more a media feeding frenzy in a slow news week than a real risk to tourists.Next week it will fade from the front page as has Ukraine etc., ""Drop the dead Donkey "" indeed!"
"To add to the discussion, remember the ""carrier"" (I don't think that is the correct medical term, e.g., the person you are getting it from) must be showing symptoms at the time of the handshake, etc. for the virus to affect you.chrisEdited: 6 years ago "
"Not sure of the correct term either Chris. I am not sure if you are correct in the assertion that an infected person must be showing symptoms before they can infect you. <An infected person, who may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, can pass on the disease through direct contact. > Is what I have read!I for one think we should stop this thread in its tracks and leave matters to the people who have to deal with the problem. It is good that people are aware that the disease exists and I wonder how many are aware that the current ""outbreak"" commenced in April. It has spread mainly through lack of action in correct diagnosis and treatment over the last four months."
"I'm all for suspending this discussion. I think we have given readers plenty of info. Of course, everyone should research the issue independently.But I wanted to provide a source for my statement that the virus is not contagious unless the person is showing symptoms. Here is a link from the website of the CDC (Center for Disease Control in the US):cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/qa.htmlHere's the quote: Can I get Ebola from a person who is infected but doesn't have any symptoms?No. Individuals who are not symptomatic are not contagious. In order for the virus to be transmitted, an individual would have to have direct contact with an individual who is experiencing symptoms.Keep in mind symptoms can be vague and resemble the flu. Also, bodily fluids and blood from an infected symptomatic person or through exposure to objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions can spread the virus (again, info from the website).I just wanted to complete the thought. But educate yourself. chrisEdited: 6 years ago "
"mfuwe - 'slow news week' - really? Oh that bru-ha-ha in the Middle East. otherwise, this will be headlines for a week and then onto the next somethin something. As to Ebola, some guy arrived JFK/NYC yesterday not feeling well,sent direct to Mt. Sinai hospital for testing which actual results not expected till next week, but even this first day.... most professionals here feel it's most likely not Ebola. And with Dr. Stephen a few clicks down the road from Emory in ATL, I don't see protesters outside the hospital which you'd think there would be if the locals had their panties twisted. Unless Stephen can advise us what's on your local stations and there are indeed crowds with placards??? Otherwise, seems the first Doc who arrived Sat is doing much better and the 2nd individual is due later today or tomorrow and will be treated likewise."
"Princess. Maybe not that slow then but there is only so much even the most productive journo can write about that region. Its been going on since 1948. Probably since David smiteth Goliath in truth. Not making light of this but there is such a condition as weariness.Seems like good news from your side of the pond on the ""E"" word.."
I have to go to tanzania on 9th august 2014 i.e tomorrow. Is it safe to travel there. any precautions should be taken care in travelling.
"There have been no cases of Ebola in East Africa. These are all on the other side of the continent, and that is a very long way off."
"Mzee. More correct to say ""no current cases in East Africa."" There have been outbreaks in the past but correctly dealt with."
"Yes there have been, but I believe that was several years ago."
"Our trip to Tanzania is less than 7 weeks now so we are monitoring what is going on. As Karl and others have said, Ebola is in West Africa which is several thousand miles from where we will be so we will have no hesitation in going as things currently stand."
I really must correct the statement made by mfuwe in post 27 regarding AIDS. AIDS (or more precisely HIV) cannot be contracted through handshakes or sharing towels or drinking glasses for that matter. I have worked for an HIV organization for 15 years. The misinformation being posted on this thread is misleading and continues to feed stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV. HIV is extremely difficult to transmit unless you are sexually involved or sharing needles with someone. Many people in Tanzania live with HIV as do people throughout sub-Saharan Africa and they are living and working in all walks of life. Be careful what you say people.I would sugges that this furum limit discussions to travel information rather than passing unsubstansiated medical information on subjects they know little about.
"I think you're misreading mfuwe's post which says ""Ebola can be contracted through handshakes and even sharing towels. It is NOT like AIDS in that respect.""So Ebola can be contracted through handshakes, unlike AIDS which cannot."
@Stokeygirl. Yes you are right. I did misread. My sincere apologies to mfuwe. So sorry.
"We're travelling to Tanzania in early October as well. We're keeping a watchful eye on this, but not really sure what to do if it starts to spread. I'm not sure if this is something travel insurance would cover, since technically no agency has banned travel to the area, it would be a voluntary decision."
"Jeremy-The reason no agency has banned travel to the area is because Ebola is not a risk to travelers (or to 99% of the general population). Good hygiene and minimal precautions will prevent it's spread. That is why there is very little chance of it ever being an issue in any civilized country.I am still baffled by the many people that are concerned about this virus. I am not underplaying the tragedy these countries have faced, but you can guarantee you will not catch it, even if you go to Sierra Leone or Liberia. Also, just as reference, you will be 3000+miles from sierra Leone. Let me state a very clear fact- the 3 countries affected have over 20,000,000 people. In 5 months, the death toll is less than 990. This is not a fast spreading or contagious disease. It is ignorance and poor hygiene that have caused 99% of the deaths and caused the affected. It will not affect you and will very unlikely spread outside the region. As mentioned before, congo and uganda have both had outbreaks in the last 4 years and people traveled to africa (even uganda) without hesitation. It is the news media and the publics ignorance that has sensationalized this outbreak.Do not worry. No travel insurance will cover it because there should not be a concern over catching ebola."
"My son of 16 is in Tanzania now and just climbed mount meru, well got altitude sickness and had to come down an hour from the top. His rung me tonight to tell me he feels ill & throwing up. What can I do but, Worry! All I'm thinking is Ebola but, I know that this is either from a dodgy meal or probably to do with the climb or descent. There are medical experts at the camp & I know I need to look how far away from the recent cases of Ebola they are. They decided to swop camps from Kenya to 800 miles away. Quite honestly, I don't think it matters where we are in the world if we all panic and change Plans in reality if your times up its up. If we are at risk they will tell us not to travel. I know that my son, is travelling with a knowledgable group of people with medics. This outbreak happened also in 2012 & did not get to Tanzania. Please do not listen too much to news reports, and look forward to your wonderful trip to Tanzania."
Well stated Stephen. It really is alarmist the way this serious matter is being bandied about in the media as though it were a plague that is spreading like a bushfire across the earth. It WILL spread if folks simply let it but like a bushfire it can and will be contained. I was actually in Uganda during the 2012 outbreak and my route took me within 40km of the epicentre ( in Kibale County). I am still here.There is nothing for tourists to East Africa to worry about. Go and enjoy the trip.smacdvanbc No worries. Accepted. (Thanks for the defence Stokey!)
I checked my travel insurance policy specifically in relation to this issue.Mine does not cover pandemics or epidemics.
i also plan to join there for working.is it right or not.
Hi I tried to resist this post as there was so much good common sense advice..but failed 188pks Where are you going West Africa or East.Have a look at a map and read many of the posts above.
"I am a UK national residing in Mwanza Tanzania. Of course one is careful over here, the trick is good sanitation,clean hands avoid salads and use only bottled water and be careful what and where you eat.Have a good medical insurance and even bring with you your own medical kit with syringes and a UV drip.I would do that regardless of the Eboli outbreak, lets face it anyone of us could have a life threating incident anywhere in the world. Enjoy your trip"
"Really? World Health Organisation say there is no treatment for it, no vaccine, no cure and that 90% of people infected die of Ebola. www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/ I'd be quite bothered if I was travelling within a thousand miles frankly"
"and remember the Black Death which wiped out 60% of human life in Europe in the 1300s? They've now found reason to believe this was a haemorrhaging fever, a strain similar to Ebola. Time for us to stop wasting money on futile wars and to invest all our money in finding cures for this and other diseases.... Er sorry, have gone off the point. Yes, I probably would still travel to Africa if I really wanted to go. I smoked for 15 years knowing I'd probably get a disease. In theory its safer to travel!"
"@alli_from_mayo:90% of the people do not die. With simple supportive care, 40-50% will die. The official death rate is ""up to 90%."" Or even quoted as 40-90% in many sources. However, the effective death rate is 40% with supportive care. In fact this outbreak has had nearly 2500 infected over a 6 month time period, with the death rate around 1,065. The WHO is one of the problems in this outbreak. Slow response, poor organization and sensationalizing to continue their need for funding. Simple education and outreach would have swamped this outbreak 4 months ago with less than 200 deaths in the proper resources had been mobilized.Ebola is hard to catch. In a region of more than 21,000,000 people, less than 1,100 have died in 6 months total. All that have died have had direct physical contact of infected fluids. It is not airborne, it does not spread through simple touching. Yes, it is a bad disease, but it is not highly contagious. It does not spread easily. Risk is low for transmission in most cases and in most civilized countries."
"Stephen, WHO has not done a particularly good job at risk communication either. In classifying Kenya as a high-risk area for transmission of Ebola on Wednesday, WHO cited the country’s role as a transportation hub in East Africa as making it more vulnerable to the disease. Korean Airlines reacted to the high-risk designation by scrapping flights to NBO starting next week. Trying to quell fears and clarify the issue (and I'm sure to ensure that airlines don't stop flying), WHO subsequently and hurriedly said that air travel even from Ebola-affected countries is low-risk for Ebola transmission and that the risk is low even for countries or airports that have high volumes of air travel to nations affected by the outbreak. Given what appears to me as contradictory advice, it's no wonder some travelers are edgy."
"Alli from mayo,Good of you to join this forum and update us on medical matters. As I wasn'tt around in 1300, i'll take your word for the impact of the black death, but I dont think it is helpful to bring it up in this context."
"Steveb108-Yes, you are correct. WHO is certainly responsible in part for the sensationalizing of this outbreak. Where were they the first 5 months of the outbreak when the first 850 people died? They could have been informing and educating. It would have likely squelched this outbreak 3-4 months ago. It wan't until the 2 americans got sick that suddenly ""everyone is going to die from it!"" started. Now, the majority of people are woefully un-informed and the WHO and media are feeding off it. All the media cares about is a story. They will add whatever drama they can to get it. Kenya IS a major airline hub, although it is in EAST AFRICA and the outbreaks are hundred if not thousands of miles away. The majority of infected are about 2500-3500 miles away. Funny the WHO said that, and even worse that korean airlines bought it.Peterscot- I agree with you. The plague of 1300's spread because sanitation was so abysmal with sewage routinely dumped in the open streets where kids played, hand washing was non-existent, and by far, world wide, for the previous 2000 years and the next 500 years, the number one cause of death was infectious. No surprise and illiterate, uninformed, dirty population was susceptible to quick spread. I agree, how is that relevant to this discussion."

and what about going now in tanzania? do you think it would be dangerous for ebola?
No more dangerous than driving to the market. In fact the two Americans today left the hospital and doing just fine.
"There is NO EBOLA in Tanzania.Ask again next week.Or, better still, go to the WHO site and getbtheir official view.Worry about malaria, and road traffic. MUCH more deadly than Ebola"
Kenya is safe.All measures have been put in place to ensure that the virus does not reach the country.I believe in what the government is doing to curb the virus entry.
Kenya is safe
"We also are / were planning a safari in Tanzania and stopover in zanzibar June 2015. Yes, it's a ways from here, but we are concerned about the ebola, and are wondering if we should just trash the idea for next year entirely, although emotionally, we really want to go."
"Whatever. Your choice. No logic in decision or thought process, so you are not being rational.Go with what you feel is best in YOUR circumstances, which we cannot know about.If you are asking, ""What would I do?"", then that is a different question."
"I am posting this from Sierra Leone. Ebola virus needs to be taken seriously but not in the manner that has been happening - driven by the media and a fear of the unknown. I would not travel into the districts of Sierra Leone where Ebola virus is prevalent but I am not unduly worried travelling in other parts of the country. My only real concern is the knee-jerk response by some governments and airlines, which has made travel in and out of Sierra Leone and the other directly affected countries very difficult.If you check with WHO and the US Center for Disease Control, the number of deaths per day in the 4 Ebola affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria) since December 2013, as a result of Ebola virus (4), is dwarfed by other causes: Lassa fever (14); TB (110); Diarrhea (404); Malaria (552) and HIV/AIDS (685). I do not have the statistics, but from what I gathered from news reports, only a couple of international travelers (business people and/or tourists - excluding those passing between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) have been infected by Ebola Virus.My condolences and apologies to those who have lost loved ones and friends in whatever manner, but far more international travelers have been shot down, or even disappeared, than infected with Ebola virus!"
"Went to our travel clinic yesterday to get all our shots (the yellow fever one really hurts!) and malaria pills. The doctor there advised us that the risk is extremely low. Obviously, things could change, but at this moment she said she would not be worried at all."
You can translate this article on Google but it seems to say 2 people in Dar es Salaam have been taken into a special centre for Ebola checking and treatment set up by the government of Tanzania. One of the people is from Benin. They haven't yet released results of whether it's Ebola or not. The article also says WHO in Kenya announced that Kenya's risk in terms of Ebola is high because it's one of the biggest flight hub for n Africa including connection between West and East Africa.http://www.ippmedia.com/frontend/?l=71028

"Yes, people all over the world are being tested for Ebola because it makes good sense to detect new cases early so they can be isolated and treated. But that also means that people with malaria, a fever, a bloody nose or any number of other illnesses will be tested out of caution, giving rise to news stories that people in the US, Europe, South and East and North Africa, etc. are all being tested for Ebola. Testing is good, testing is information gathering and the potential to isolate and treat. As the article was dated the 15th, I'm guessing this wasn't an issue. There's also an East African medical conference going on right now in which doctors and epidemiologists and health care workers are talking about Ebola, in part, and making action plans to implement in the event that a person tests positive in any of their countries. Preparation and planning are necessary, so this is a good thing. There were cases of Ebola viral disease in Uganda in the past, so it's not unheard of - however with preparation and a good plan of action in place, they can isolate, treat, and contain. So it's not alarming that the medical community is testing people, nor that they are meeting to form plans of action for potential outbreaks. They should be doing both of those things, as should any other country with the means to do so.Here are a couple of English language Tanzanian news sites: http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php and http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/ --> you'll read about a lot of road accidents and updates on local road work and power projects and stuff, but they also cover medical type news."
"Uganda has not had cases in 2014 or even 2013 (before that, I'm not sure on dates, but the cases were few and have been long since taken care of). Please be careful about spreading false accusations."
So far..there are no confirmed reported cases of Ebola in East Africa.
"All Travel Insurers I have contacted (3 so far) will not cover cancellation should Ebola appear in your African destination (mine were central Africa- Kenya and south of there) as the risk is already ""forseeable""Be careful to get written confirmation you are covered if you cancel due to an outbreak of Ebola in your desination"
"Loraliy, I'm giving information. Having a virus within the boundaries of a country is not an ""accusation"" - it is simply epidemiological data. And yes, there were outbreaks within the country that I mentioned two years ago, and that's simply a fact. There are none there now. Acting as if it's something to be ashamed of or hidden doesn't help matters any more than panic and blanket fear does. Facts are facts. Knowing how to differentiate between that and alarmist media reports is important."
"I am planning a trip to Tanzania for the end of the year/Jan 2015. The ebola virus is expanding and I don't know where it will stop.(CNN) - The Democratic Republic of Congo is reporting new Ebola cases in a northern town, sparking fears that the deadly virus is expanding far beyond West Africa."
"I too am planning to visit Kenya & Tanzania, but not until mid-August of next year, almost a year from now. Anything could happen within a year. I have not paid any deposits for my safari/climb which I planned to pay in March of next year. I will wait and see what happens. If the situation remains as it is now, I will still go for sure!"
Put simply - cancel - if you want to take risks then go - but if you want to be safe and sure change your plans. The ground situation is not good - and the country has many other issues and diseases. No one in their right mind would consider this region a is - you could die.Edited: 5 years ago 
"DeadlyddPerth, You are incorrect and obviously don't know much about Ebola or the region. Many people in their right mind consider this region and enjoy a great trip. As a doctor, I was there 2 weeks ago. Very safe. Ebola is very hard to catch and can virtually be guaranteed you will not get it, even if you travel to west africa (liberia, Sierra leone and the such). If you knew anything about this virus, your advice would be different.Also, please give me the stats about people dying in East Africa from Ebola....."
"Welcome back, Stephen. We missed your sage advice. Hope it was a good trip - chris"
"Deadlyddperth, Not sure where you get your information from, but I'm on the ground in Tanzania, and conditions here are fine. I live here half the year now , half in the USA. I have a much higher chance of getting killed in a car crash in the US than I do of dying here, especially of Ebola. Why the attempt at scare tactics?"
Read carefully news from experts and reputable sources. This is an epidemic that is out of control and experts suggest will be a year to eighteen months in duration. Two latest reports: washingtonpost.com/news/…andhttp://www.wired.com/2014/09/r0-ebola/
"The media likes to speculate and that's what most of the reports are, just pure speculation. If you even look at the links you posted, Tanzania is not affected/ hardly affected at all (from what they speculate). The second report is pure mathematical specualtion that also quotes a Hollywood movie. As I mentioned before, I am planning a big trip to Kenya & Tanzania for August next year and will wait and see what the situation is like in March, when I will pay a deposit to the local agency. If the situation remains similar to the present, I will surely go."
"These reports have little if anything to do with Tanzania. Also, they are speculation based on no attempt at control. Remember, this epidemic was going for 9 months before anyone heard of it. Only after two americans got it was anyone concerned on this or any other travel website. The outbreak started 10-11 months ago. Do you mean a total of a year, a total of 18 months or an additional? You can't answer because they can't either. Do you mean before the last death or cure of the last patient? Do you mean just in West Africa or all over the world?I would question the ""experts"" you quote and ""reputable"" sources you supposedly quote. Remember, Africa is not a country, it is a continent larger than North American, Central America, South America, Europe and Australia- ALL PUT TOGETHER. Would you cancel a trip to Miami because there was an outbreak in Seattle Washington???Your references are actually mathematical models and do little to describe the actual spread. In fact one has nothing to do with spread but just talks about the fruit bat that could carry the virus. Guess what, that bat has always carried the virus. That hasn't changed in thousands of years. Alarmist and journalistic hyperbole are all this is. It is perfectly safe to travel to east africa. Ebola is very hard to catch and not a concern. Be more concerned about malaria or food borne illnesses or water borne illnesses. Far more deaths in East africa from these than Ebola times 100."
All this scare-mongering is really doing nothing but hurting the economies of African nations. :-(
"Actually Chris, it is already in the Congo (DRC), which shares a land border with tanzania"
"And as for Kenya....http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28769678Sure it is important not to be too alarmist, but let's not be so dismissive of the dangers gang"
"The Ebola in the DRC is in the far north, and unrelated to the outbreak in West Africa. This is a different strain to that found in the west of Africa.Outbreaks occur in this region fairly regular.There is no land border between the DRC and Tanzania. There is a common border down the middle of Lake Tanganyika.In the north Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda are in between the DRC and Tanzania.The WHO spokesperson quoted in the BBC article is mistaken in assuming that Nairobi is a major transport hub to West Africa. There are more flights from this region to Europe and North America than there are to East Africa.A bit of common sense always should be applied when reading anything about Africa."
"Considering that it's now in the USA, better not travel there either <insert heavy sarcasm>.Should we cancel all world travel?Yes, it is a serious illness and must be addressed medically, but unless we, as a WORLD, shut down all cross-border travel, anyone anywhere could come into contact with someone who might have Ebola.Caution, not scare tactics and hysteria, are in order."
"Has anybody else noticed that most if not all of the stupid posts on here come from ""One post wonders""? They have a common theme of misinformed rubbish combined with a total lack of Geography. Maybe there could be research into an intelligent virus that only affects Trolls.As it is, I feel this thread has well passed its catch by day and should be closed.But until then, as re-assurance to the sensible amongst us, I can state that I have a trip to Kenya scheduled for December and another to Uganda in March and my biggest worry is neither Ebola nor Al Kebab. It is whether I make my airport connections. Can somebody fix that for me please?Kathy.. Peter Scotts post #10 was very prophetic.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Their are outcrys for closing all borders. Think about that. If they closed all borders down and forbid travel, how would those who are helping with this disease get to those who need help and assistance in order to keep this disease contained.Absolute foolishness."
"In the Land of the blind, the one-eyed man is King...And there's none so blind as those who don't want to see.Thanks, Mfuwe."
"Last evening at a dinner party with at least 30/people, many of whom are worldwide travelers, some even to various areas in Africa - the word Ebola was never spoken. And when earlier in the afternoon there was a report that an inbound airline pax (from Liberia thru Brussels) was complaining of nausea, the media went into panic, whereas I yelled at the TV, ""nausea, not unusual if he ate airline food."" As it turned out he had an upset tummy, nothing to do with Ebola. Suggest you all - expecially the OPW - turn off the TV, close the newspaper and go about your lives, Unless there's some major change, remember that 'headline' news lasts maybe 10/days, so for those who seem to be driving themselves nuts and imparting incorrect information, get over it and stop it!"
"i can't find a travel insurer who will refund fares etc if Ebola in Tanzania lead to a trip there being cancelledthey all say ""you know the risk"" so its not insurerable"
"You can buy a travel insurance policy that has a ""Cancel for Any Reason"" clause. They are a bit more expensive, you have to insure the full amount of your trip, and you need to purchase the policy generally within two weeks of paying your initial deposit. We have a trip planned for next summer and this is the type of insurance we purchased."
There's been a case in Spain. A nurse treating a victim flown there from West Africa.
"Unless you purchased the most expensive airfare, most other tickets are non-refundable. Some might allow for you to rebook to another date. But cash back? LOL! Suggestion... stop looking for something you ain't going to get! Besides there is no Ebola in East Africa."
I have been working in Tanzania for the past 2 years and never got sick. By planning your trip to east africa you need to get some injections for you yellow card. Those injections keep you safe and you don't sick. But be careful and check updates about the Ebola virus.

"I live in Tanzania for 6 months of the year. If I thought there was any issue, I would leave, at this time, there is not one recorded case of Ebola in Tanzania or Zambia (I think Kenya is the same) . The East African countries have been surprisingly quick to block all air travellers from the affected countries and all have been faster than than western nations in installing screening equipment at air and land borders. The issue here is infected people leaving west Africa and going to western nations including the US. The carrier of this disease is air transport. In my opinion the danger is to the developed nations not other African nations- and the danger is borne by aircraft."
Totally agree 4sandi. It's all in the media.
"If one happens to be a person who has fear of whatever, just bring a package of Clorox wipes to clean the area where you'll sit and in the loos. Wish the media would find another subject to drive us nuts about :-) This one is getting boring."
"I agree. CNN showing live shots of the nurse who contracted ebola in the US being transferred to another hospital via helicopter, and minute by minute commentary. Idiotic. It will take a major natural disaster to get them to focus on anything else. :-("
Stop watching TV. You might catch it off the screen.
"Ha ha, really!"
"Well not really , but there have been so many crazy myths around I thought I may as well add another.To bring back a sense of realism this is an extract from 'how Nigeria appears to have beaten the Ebola threat"". < the right techniques at the right speed > reacted to the one case that flew in to the capital of the most populated country in Africa. 19 cases and 8 deaths in a population of 170million."
there is nothing to worry about Tanzania and Kenya because so far the is no Ebola case in these two countries plus by the mid of 2015 well hope this Ebola thing will be over.
"Hi, I just wanted to check if you managed to go ahead with your trip. Thanks!"
poojabhWhat do you mean by your post.....even though the number of tourists have decreased in Tz due to the Ebola scare....there are many tourists there travelling freely and no Ebola.
"Was just in Tz. American tourism is down 30% because the Ebola scare, yet, there have been zero deaths from Ebola in Tz AND Madrid is closer to the outbreak than Arusha is. Get a map, folks, read the facts and BOOK your trip!!!"
"As it happens, we will be in both Tanzania and Madrid in first half of 2015. When people ask us if we're afraid to go to Tanzania, we say, why, we'll be closer to Ebola in Madrid! (not to mention we're waaaay closer to Houston) sadly, the 24/7 news cycle has made us frightened of our own shadows. Witness ""The Interview,"" how easily some got freaked.I agree with Mfuwe. turn off the TV and go out and experience the world."

"Having just returned from Tanzania, I've seen the impact of fear on the people who live there. We were the only people staying at one of the camps we booked, and tourism was down everywhere. Entering the country from Minnesota, it occurred to me that the Tanzanians had more reason to worry that I'd transmit the flu than I had to worry about Ebola. Next year, who knows? Most TO's seem to be willing to delay trips if there's an outbreak. You should ask. If not, the advice to get Cancel for Any Reason insurance makes sense. We have now had Ebola in the U.S. We have Dengue Fever. We have flu that kills people. I guess everyone has to figure out their own risk tolerance, but so far, Ebola in Tanzania isn't an issue."

"Haricotsv2-Thanks for the update. It is very sad to hear that the tourist industry is getting pummeled so badly, the people there really rely on it. I myself had planned to climb Mt Kenya and then afterwards go on a week-logn safari in Southern Tanzania in August, but all my travel mates cancelled on me out of fear of ebola. This is really unfortunate as there is no way I can afford a solo safari and do not want to join a group of strangers. My friends and I have postponed the trip until August 2016."
"There's been Dengue Fever in the US for years. About 30,000+ die of flu yearly in the US. And all of a sudden people are scared of these? Ebola was brought into the US by someone from Africa and sadly died; the nurse who was treating him came down with Ebola but was treated and is now doing just fine. There has NOT been an outbreak of Ebola in the US. Right now I'd be more concerned about the irresponsible parents who do not vaccinate their children against Measles (MMR) which is having a good ole time attacking those who haven't... and this one is air-borne. Or last year, those not vaccinated who came down with whooping cough and no doubt still more to come! Am sure most everyone who posts here on TA has had all their inolculations as children and hopefully 'boosters' before departing for Africa (TP*D, Hep-A, Polio, Typhoid)... I certainly did! *pertussis - whooping coughEdited: 5 years ago "
"I clearly agree with you , especially regarding the measles vaccines. Amazign how stupid my country has become since I left it for good in 1985. In my position, however, there is nothing I can do if my travel companions cancel on me. I'm still intending to go next year, maybe by then I can round up a few friends who are not paranoid.Edited: 5 years ago "
