Will be interesting to see what this is about:https:/…
Will be interesting. But until countries like Canada and the UK do away with travel warnings and 14 day quarantine. It really doesn't matter what the DR does for Tourism Plan.
the Dominican Republic almost has as many covid cases as Canada..
"TY Sly. It will indeed be very interesting. The comment below the article was also interesting. Testing is being done at the airport(or proof of the same). Resorts have their Covid plans in place. The reviews I have read re Hyatt Zilara are very positive with regard to their protocols. We plan on following the same protocols as we do at home. I am still scratching my head as to why my own country has a Level 4 Travel Advisory from the US State Department, but the CDC has dropped its suggestion for a 14 day return quarantine. Frankly, imho, its political based on China's heavy involvement in the DR."
"Yes Prize, some good reviews from Hyatt and Dreams Macao. Resorts are treating guests very well. As for DR cases, they have been on the down slope for a couple of weeks now. Still many cases and unstable but getting lower slowly with very few cases in PC. So, this tourism plan will likely confirm that the DR is dedicated to not shutting down but moving forward with restrictions as required."
Sly....I have been following the stats as well. Here is to hoping you are correct!
"Just to add what caught my eye was this paragraph."" The Government will also invest RD $ 420 million in programs to guarantee air routes, through an agreement with the airlines.""Airlines in the UK will not have a a direct agreement with the DR as it up to our FCO ( Foreign & Government Office ) if they allow airlines to fly to the DR or other countries around the world.Angie."
"Thanks Angie. I must say that this exceeds my expectations on what I thought they would come out with. I'm looking forward to getting more details but the insurance piece is interesting with the creation of medical ""bubble"" for those affected (no army barracks...). And the fact they would cover extra fees to change your flights is big too. Not sure if no testing requirement is a good or bad thing. Don't believe it will impact Canada's decision on our upcoming extension of the 14 days quarantine rule as the DR is only one of many destinations. Again, this certainly shows that the DR has no intention of shutting down tourism again."
"Sly,<< Not sure if no testing requirement is a good or bad thing. >>Well I am sorry to say this would be a bad thing in my eyes and a sure way to spread the virus especially with travellers who could be possible asymptomatic carriers.I think the DR Government are clutching at straws.IMO.I have just read this article about covid cases reporting and testing by a doctor.COVID-19 cases reported by authorities do not represent reality in the country, according to doctorCarlos Manuel Feliz Cuello said that the real picture will be when there is constant testing for at least a weekWith the exception of the 13th, the data contained in the bulletins issued by the Ministry of Public Health from August 8 to 25 show that the number of patients recovered per day exceeds the number of new infections.However, it is still not possible to speak of promising data, because the figures do not correspond to what really happens daily in the Dominican Republic regarding the disease.This was explained by the epidemiologist and health worker, Carlos Manuel Feliz Cuello , who said that while the authorities are not offering in a maximum of 24 hours the results of the PCR tests that are carried out and that the reports of the people who are discharged correspond At the same period, there will be no real picture of the incidence of COVID-19.This Tuesday, the Minister of Public Health, Plutarco Arias, admitted that there is a bottleneck in terms of the delivery of the results of the COVID-19 tests that have been carried out on the population.Another point to take into account to determine the real situation of the coronavirus, according to the epidemiologist, is the number of tests carried out per day, which must be constant for at least a week.“The right thing to do is to decide for a week to do an active and massive search for cases, every day. So you can measure and have a real projection, ""said Feliz Cuello, who warned that, if one day fewer tests are done than the other, the measurement will not be reliable and it will not be possible to detect what is being sought.The health worker trusted that the new authorities will solve the technical problems in the National Laboratory, as well as the shortage of personnel so that they have the capacity to carry out the seven thousand daily tests that they promised and to solve the cases that are bottled, ""because of nothing It will be useful if they bring the 100,000 tests ”.In addition, he explained that there is no systematic record of several variables, for example, a positivity rate below 5%, which is what reflects that the infestation capacity of the virus is totally diminished. ""As long as that positivity is above 10%, it means that the virus is active in the country.""This Tuesday, August 25, the Ministry of Public Health reported that 902 people overcame the coronavirus in the last 24 hours, at which time 609 new infections were also registered.From August 8 to 25, the authorities notified that 21,067 people had overcome the disease, while 14,508 new cases were recorded. In addition, 53,602 PCR tests were performed, with 2,977 the average per day.To date, the Dominican Republic accumulates 92,217 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,585 deaths , when 353,254 PCR samples have been processed. The positivity rate, based on the tests of the last four weeks, stands at 30.28%.Among the measures announced by the new authorities to face the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, is the acquisition of 100,000 PCR tests, which they reported would arrive in the country this Tuesday. In addition, they said that they are projected to process between seven and 10,000 tests per day.Angie."
"<< “ Airlines in the UK will not have a a direct agreement with the DR as it up to our FCO... if they allow airlines to fly to the DR” >>That does not preclude an arrangement with the DR. Consider than even if/when the FCO says “you CAN fly to the DR” it may not be a sensible financial decision to do so. An arrangement with the DR government might help airlines decide to fly in that case.Edited: 7:39 am, August 26, 2020 "
"Did it mention anywhere when the new ""no test required "" starts?"
"WinnieNo not as yet, too early to say as the proposed plan was only just released yesterday.Angie."
"Angie, agree that some testing would be better than none however, it doesn't guarantee everything. We've seen travellers going to PC with negative test only to return and test positive. Were they infected before and simply showing negative or did they get infected in PC? It was confirmed that under the new plan, travellers would still be tested randomly. As for numbers, they can be interpreted many different ways but cases in the DR in the past 7 days: 1004, 883, 857, 694, 600, 447, 609. Very few cases in La Altagracia."
This makes no sense to me. What am I missing?Removing the mandated arrival tests is simply putting everyone at risk especially the Dominican people!!!I realize that the tests aren’t foolproof but Why not keep the mandated tests AND offer free covid medical? Anything to minimize the arrival and spread of covid into the country is better than nothing even though it’s not 100% isn’t it?If the DR doesn’t have enough test kits for tourists and their own healthcare that’s understandable but then make it a rule that everyone must arrive with a test then. Wouldn’t that just be safer for everyone? Or better yet maybe the airlines themselves need to mandate that no one is allowed to board a flight without a negative test result.
"I still think that because they will be doing random testing, most travellers wouldn't risk getting flagged and will still pre-test (I hope). I will for sure if I travel next month regardless of new rules."
"<< most travellers wouldn't risk getting flagged and will still pre-test (I hope). >>I would hope so too but wont hold my breath.<< I will for sure if I travel next month regardless of new rules. >>You are a responsible traveller though, there are many who are not and will not bother.Angie."
"Knowing that insurance costs and flight changing costs would be covered may influence some to not get tested and take a chance but getting stuck in the ""bubble"" for 14 days may not be that appealing to risk it. Will be curious to see how many ""risk"" it and don't pre-test."
"The problem is getting the test back in 5 days, it's really difficult in a lot of places."
SlyJust read the insurance will be provided to the visitor until December 2020.so only covers the next 3 months.Angie.
"Question is, since there will be no requirement to pre-test, will there still be a 5 days validity on those who pre-test? Also, has there been a confirmation of Oct 1st being the effective date for this new no test required rule? Angie, I guess this is an initial step to ""encourage"" travellers to visit until the high season.Edited: 10:43 am, August 26, 2020 "
"Sly<< Also, has there been a confirmation of Oct 1st being the effective date for this new no test required rule? >>I have not found any confirmation that Oct 1st is the effective date stated by President Abinader or David Collado, Minister of Tourism in any reports I have read.Angie."
"Angie.. check this link..https:/…Edited: 11:02 am, August 26, 2020 "
Thanks Wahoo. I guess they are switching to a breathalyzer test. It doesn't clearly say what happens if you show up with pre-test whether you would still be required to random test. End of September is when I'm looking to go so would be smack in the middle of those changes.
"LOL... well with limited bathroom access, even the pre-flight cold pint will likely not be on the menu. Nothing worse than a 4 hours flight with no bathroom breaks."
Cheers Wahoo but it still does not specifically say Oct 1st just says end of September.........am I just being pedantic !Don't go much on with them switching to a breathalyzer test as it is still in clinical trials. They are trying to run before they can walk.Angie.
"As we await the decision on the 14 day quarantine rule next week, a reminder that Canadian Air Companies (and more specifically AC) have lobbied the government to remove the 14 days requirement or at the very least, to allow a waiver for selected countries. Sadly, the DR wasn't on the proposed list but if anything, I hope that they at least go to this system versus mandated quarantine for any country."
Angie.. you absolutely read it correctly and I agree. Still a bit vague! Tough to get absolutes
If you call health Canada they will tell you the decision to extend the 14 day quarantine rule has already been decided. They just have not updated the website. There won’t be any new re-evaluation date. It’s been extended until further notice
Surprised they would tell folks over the phone before an official announcement has been made but thanks Smittygirl. Let's see if that is accurate. Not putting an expiry date would also be surprising as even border closing etc... have a timeline attached. But it is 2020 so anything is now possible.
"As long as Canadian travelers are returning from a destination that's saying ""come on in, the water's fine"", and every passenger is not tested before boarding to return home, the 14 day quarantine should remain. 14 days above ground is better than 6 feet under.....Personally, with these new D.R. entry policies, every airline should administer a Covid test at check in (BOTH WAYS). With the 2 hr. check in window, results could be back, and a re-check ,if necessary, before anyone boards. Although not perfect, or perhaps accurate, I'd feel better than ""come on in, let's play Covid bingo"". For those who feel it's going to increase airline fares, get ready, there going up anyway."
"Post #29 & 30, I actually sent a message on FB messsenger to Travel.gc.ca about a decision extending the quarantine past August 31 and will quote verbatim what they sent me: ""Hello, Requirements related to mandatory isolation and quarantine are in place until August 31 and an extension is currently being reviewed""."
"Thanks. With the deadline/expiry coming on Monday, really hoping they make an announcement one way or another before the weekend (don't believe government folks work on the weekend much....LOL)."
"Slyguy23, I hope we hear before the weekend. I'm thinking they will make us wait until Monday. They are going to leave us hanging until the bitter end. LOL"
"Yes, more than likely. Note that the last announcement/extension came the day before the deadline but was during the week (29 and 30 June) so will see. Since our government is on holidays again, lol, will see."
