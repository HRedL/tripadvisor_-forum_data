"Wondering if anybody else has had similar issues? We booked our flights to Dubai several months ago, we tend to stay at the same hotel so book directly with them. However, after seeing Kenwood travel being mentioned on here we looked into it and saw a lovely hotel in Ras Al Khaimah do we booked that instead for April 24th. The company phoned me a couple of weeks ago saying that obviously our holiday won’t be going ahead as we can’t travel so they wanted us to accept a voucher. We said we would wait until the suggested two weeks before just incase the situation changed but obviously it hasn’t. We have been contacted again with the offer of vouchers but the only time we can go they quoted a price of almost 3 times the original price! We cannot pay this but they are refusing to refund us saying that the hotel is fully operational therefore we can go. What a ludicrous statement as we cannot get there. Has anybody else had similar issues? We are seeking advice but so far everything suggests we are entitled to a refund and that agents will try it on by encouraging people to take vouchers. Their attitude certainly hasn’t been helpful and I wouldn’t want to book with the again in the future."
Unfortunately this is the same scenario with a lot of travel agents.. trying to pass off credit notes to be used at a Later date seems to be the norm.. you can try to push for a refund but im not sure how it will pan out..Im in the same scenario with another travel agent over the same predicament..
"Thanks Shaun for your informative answer, as always. You gave us a lot of good information before our first trip to Dubai a couple of years agoAnyway, no we didn’t book them together, we usually book our flights with Emirates and then book directly with the hotel, Doubletree Hilton Business Bay. We love the hotel so we stay there each time we go. This time we booked with Kenwood, big mistake. I think their attitude is awful and hasn’t helped at all. My husband can’t choose his holidays, he has set ones so we are restricted as to when we go. So the dates we gave are just not financially viable, £2,200 instead of £815! So they said that the hotel is fully operational (not true) so we can still go. What a stupid thing to say when there are no flights and FCO says not to travel. They left it by saying if we don’t show up at the hotel we will lose our money! Hmm, if we start walking and swimming maybe we’d get there lol. I wouldn’t mind but Hilton are offering refunds so Kenwood will get the money back but won’t pass it to us. So unprofessional."
"It’ll be interesting to hear how you get on faddy, good luck"
"Yes we may go down that route Shaun. David is livid and won’t let it rest, he abhors injustice as do I. He’s going to get in touch with the credit card company to start with and then we’ll look at the small claims court which we’ve used before so we know what we’re doing. I don’t think there’s much point trying to be reasonable, we gave the alternative dates so there’s nothing more we can do and their attitude has put us off anyway. How ridiculous and puerile to suggest if we don’t show up at the hotel, I mean c’mon how on earth can we do that for goodness sake."
"It's good I've helped you before, and I hope can do so again.CC/SEc 75 is another decent course of action as it holds the CC partly responsible - and they carry far greater powers of persuasion with providers. I'm not sure, but I think they withhold an excess of any possible refunds but losing 100 quid against getting back far more could be worth it.So your booking with Kenwood is only the hotel?If so, it changes things significantly as it would not be considered a package, but a hotel only booking (so is under different regulations).The hotel you've booked is in in Ras Al Khaimah?Unfortunately, if it is a hotel-only booking via an agent you're likely to have to depend on goodwill. It's not always the case that they will get their money back from a chain, even if said chain is offering concessions - RAK is also a different emirate, so is operating under different restrictions in some instances.The 'hotel operating as normal' is generally a stance because if the hotel had closed or gone out of business, it is a different course for resolution.Additionally, lots of agents are trying to direct travellers to claim on insurance to alleviate some pressure on themselves. Again, this may depend on individual circumstances and when travel insurance was taken out - and how extensive it is.My advice if it is a hotel-only booking is to try and make your case for a refund on a discretionary basis, ie these are the only dates you can manage and FCO advice is against all non-essential travel.Looking at KT's COVID-19 it seems they are a being a bit cheeky with their interpretation of FCO advice, ie that it seems to be considering if there is specific advice against a country rather that the later (and over-arching) FCO advice not to travel anywhere that was the latest update from a few days ago.Edited: 4:55 am, April 10, 2020 "
These links may help BTWThis was when FCO changed their advice 4 days agohttps://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…https:/…20https:/…https:/…
"ive used Kenwood previously and had one issue a few years ago with them and the Hilton, they seem to get a lot of promotion offers from Hilton of which are are not refundable , in my case i had changed my mind but they would not move the money i had paid to another booking as they insisted it was part of the terms of the booking i had made. Kenwood on the other hand have moved my hotels for free on other brands. its a real pain but i would keep pursing them , i cant ever imagine that hotel would sell at that price only at xmas . Good luck"
"Thanks lovedogs and Shaun, I will look at those links. I think goodwill has gone out of the window because it was clear from the beginning that they were not prepared to be helpful which is a shame because we use Hilton a lot and have never had any issues with the actual hotel brand who have always been excellent. As IHG members we’ve received emails stating that monies will be refunded or rescheduled but we’ve not booked directly with them on this occasion sadly. It’s disgraceful that certain agents are attempting to profiteer from a tragic event. Thanks all, thank heavens Emirates are being sensible and professional about all this!"
Shaun thanks and yes I’ll definitely let you know. Watch this space haha
"Excellent you have used the small claims court before ;-) ......easy and cheap.If other routes fail, give them notice and do it. I will wager you get the refund before it gets to ""court"".Good luck!"
"Ripple11 thanks, we’ll post an update when we hear anything. We suspect Kenwood haven’t even forwarded the money over to our hotel, it’s outrageous that they will not return it to us and in my opinion tantamount to theft."
"i really feel for you , the county court is still operating even though not open to public cases but judges are still sitting on cases , so when the date passes for travel id hit in my claim.there is a large part of the industry that currently cant proceed to the county court ie repossessions , rent arrears, bailiffs so get it in whilst they cant get there claims in and hopefully you wont have such a long wait for your claim to be heard/listed.Shaun .how does it work if you have money partly with CC and then say a different option like cheque or debit card , i always pay deposit on CC then balance by other means, are credit vouchers being offered for same destination or can you choose another destination as long if you use same airine.the other thing i would be wondering if these agents are not taking any calls then they are not planning or taking on new business so are they playing a waiting game before filing for administration and hiving off what they can for atol to be the eventual rescue plan. Any one not attempting to make new business suggests to me they have a ulterior motive going on.Edited: 10:40 am, April 15, 2020 "
"@ LD - AFAIA different payment methods cover *just* the sum paid per payment method, so without a doubt a Credit Card offers more protection so is arguably better to pay any travel spend.AMEX, charge cards, debit card, prepaid cards etc. all have lesser reassurance and security provisions I believe.Note there is a difference in a Refund Credit Note and vouchers/credit that an agent may offer. ABTA do have strict conditions and clauses to suppport RCNS that need complying with by the agent.An agent could give any old voucher (or try to) which could end up being as useful as Zimbabwean dollars. This is why ABTA RCNs are the best compromise as they're ATOL protected but also (theoretically) can then turn into a refund if not used by end of July.*Generally* any sort of credit offering/goodwill will likely be tied to the agent's terms (or even additional terms) but there's every chance some could simply be like a gift voucher, in other words just for a sum, and not tied to an airline, hotel, or even location.Emirates - before they offered refunds as openly as they seem to be trying to do as of yesterday - were trying to incentivise travellers taking vouchers by offering things such as no fare difference, changes in the same segment and a lengthy period to use them (so possibly better value if one wanted to travel, rather than a refund).Regarding agents and their plans for future, I'd recommend looking into the ownership of Ltd companies on Companies House, and especially see who the Directors and what (if any) other companies they may involved in. Without wanting to sound all Panama Papers, some of these companies cross-trade with companies in the same group for funds, capital etc. so it's often a bit of a fish around to work out how to escalate to.Hope this helps....Edited: 3:31 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Of course, check to see if the agent is a member of ABTA too - an interesting reply came up earlier that Destination2 is not part of ABTA yet is using the terminology of 'RCN' (proper noun - ABTA term) in their policy."
most i see are not abta but atol only .
"Morning allJust thought I’d give a long overdue update to this. Thanks to our credit card company we received our money back in full on what I believe is called a ‘chargeback.’ This was done efficiently and promptly, we received our money back within 7 days and then the credit card company pursued Kenwood Travel. Apparently they have 42 days to appeal but they told us that as Kenwood were in the wrong this wouldn’t happen. We were disgusted with the way Kenwood behaved refusing to refund us, particularly as we spoke to Waldorf Astoria who hadn’t even been paid by Kenwood! Apparently the monies aren’t forwarded to the hotel until we arrive so they were keeping our money and refusing to return it! Thank heavens we approached the credit card company and I would urge anyone having problems retrieving their money to do the same. The gentleman my husband spoke to said they had been inundated with charge backs which doesn’t surprise me. Oh, and David put a damning review on Kenwood’s page and they removed it! What on earth is the point of only accepting good reviews lol. The mind boggles but at least we had a good ending to our situation.Edited: 4:48 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Hi Rosina,Result - pleased for you. Your last point is extremely pertinent at the moment regarding the reliability and integrity of reviews. I would really encourage people to research widely and draw on opinions of people from a wide cross-section of sites and sources. Your experience shows how review sites can be manipulated to present an image which suits the vendor - I don't even look at a couple of the well known UK ones anymore. Great news again. Well done!"
"Hi toagodunknownThanks, and yes it’s really disconcerting that this goes on. I look at reviews with an open mind tbh but to be prevented from accessing negative reviews by means of subterfuge is unacceptable. Hopefully they can’t remove this. I think more people rely on trip advisor reports than those on an actual company website. I hope our experience gives optimism to others who may have lost money. Have a nice day"

"Yes well done, but can i add many agents have acted in the same way , i think a lot has been down to the physical aspect of having the manpower to do the refunds in the quantity they have had to deal with."
"Hey Rosina, that's wonderful news - pleased for you. I'm glad you had the patience and persistence to follow it through, and thanks for your feedback.Yep, chargebacks or S75 can work well (I think I mentioned it earlier in the thread) but I'd also say in general with these things, it's knowing 'which dog to bring to the fight'. Early on when COVID started impacting there was a real lack of clarity on RCNs and other things from ABTA, and cases where chargebacks weren't always working (some technicalities and others just trying it on). It can be the least hassle though and least involving, whereas sometimes just a polite but direct letter to the directors can also work.All experiences matter and your feedback is very, very helpful especially if others are in the same boat.As for reviews, yeah they've been gamified on a lot of sites - this very one included - and it's tough to know where to post reviews that will really count. If I had to do one, it would be Google if only in terms of visibility across the web, rather than on a specific site. I gave up on TA when I realised how little policing they did of reviews that clearly were against their rules and fake.Tip - sometimes people have a bias against 1 and 5-star reviews, so sometimes the more effective way to critique is a two-star one (they're less likely to get pulled too) and also, word count matters (more words, often means algorithm bubbles them to be more visible because the writer is more invested.Edited: 10:48 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Shaun thanks for your tips, they’ve always been really helpful. I thought David put the review on their own page but I’m wrong he said he did it on google so I’m not sure how the authority was given to remove it. The only thing I can think of is he mentioned the irony of Kenwood having millions in the bank. However, this is not speculation but fact based on information gained from Companies House which is available to the public. He quite likes having a trawl through the accounts of various companies, sad eh lol. Anyway, thanks everyone and apologies for the format of this, I noticed my last post had lots of hyphens at line endings, not my doing but I think maybe down to doing this on my phone? Also apologies for the deleted posts, I inadvertently replicated the same one so that it appeared 6 times! Cheers, Karen"
"There's always the option of reporting to CMA and to ABTAhttps:/…register-a-complainthttps:/…https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…Interesting to read about the issue with Google; I thought business could only respond or flag for 'review' if disagree. They do have certain rules they're keen on so it may be a submission rule, but really not sure - sorry.May be worth double-checking email to see if it's marked comments or something? May also be worth checking the Local Guides forum too."
"i have no wish to defend kenwood as i have no idea what your customer experience was with them but i can give you some comments on the refund process with most agents as i was a admin on one of the support groups that was set up . (not for kenwood) .The travel ind went in to chaos around the 12 March.Lockdown on the 23rd March. As Shaun stated there was little clarity as to what agents had to do and the guidance was to repay in the main by the end of July by ABTA for flights and package holidays .Kenwood are yes a multi million pound business , i know as i also have seen their company house records but they work from a office in the city of London , their staff have never homeworked , so at lockdown many were furloughed and those that were operational had to ensure that systems were in place for staff to start the refund process, many holidays were complicated as had many elements eg a holiday to florida could include car hire , park passes, transfers, flights , hotels and the agents had to source back from their suppliers all these elements. A lot of people instead because they didnt want to wait went through the charge back process which stops the agent being involved and many started that process at the start of lockdown a lot of card companies did quickly give money back but the agent still had a specific time to dispute . As time went on the card companies were overwhelmed and some cards companies were refusing point blank to refund and others were taking weeks to process. Kenwood i would suspect have around 50 staff with thousands of holidays to refund. But prob only a handful were operational for the most of the time in lock down.(4 months).i had spoken to kenwood around june and they were working around the clock to refund for the staff that were working and they were all working from home. i think overall the issue with kenwood was in main staff were furloughed , those that weren't were tasked in getting people home that were stranded and then starting the refund process ( that had no training to do that role) , no one would have thought lockdown would have lasted 4 months i think as the norm their accounts team is normally three staff that would do this sort of work . Had agents used their own reserves to pay people back in time they would have been skint . so they needed to secure money back they had paid out ie airlines , third partys etc and in date order. Even emirates direct were not refunding within 90 days.Kenwood comms on their website was always updated and clear .No one seems to has a issue with the insurance ind not paying out .but many expected the agent to refund in full.Virgin/Tui/ Love Holidays were on a different scale for poor customer service and were slaughtered in the media for non compliance and many still are waiting for their money. so the fact you have your money back 3 months later actually is pretty good , most will be lucky if they get it back by next easter.if i was to use a agent going forward for what i know and the research i did as my time on that support group i would recommend British Airways, Kenwood and southall , hays, kunoni, destinology i would steer away with anyone with a name starting D named on here and emirates holiday have been pretty dire as well. i cant say the support group i was on for legal reasons but i can assure you Kenwood were a dream to deal with over others .as were southall who sorted my trip out .just my thoughts as someone that was working to help others get their money back and learning how different agents operated."
"Lovedogs I’m not quite sure what you’re saying because you started off saying Kenwood furloughed staff and they wouldn’t be working from home and then went on to say they were working from home. So presumably you’ve booked holidays with them and have had a good experience in view of the fact you would recommend them? So have I with every holiday I have ever booked except with Kenwood. I wonder if your view would be different if you had experienced what myself and many others had experienced with this unprofessional company. I didn’t go into too much detail because I didn’t think I needed to but they were rude, unhelpful and downright obstinate. I could have slightly more sympathy if they had paid the hotel our money and were struggling to retrieve it from them. To to bank it, keep it and refuse point blank to refund us is an utter disgrace. The credit card company returned our money almost immediately because they knew Kenwood were in the wrong. This was several months ago so we didn’t wait long at all. Interestingly Kenwood phoned us begging us to let them refund us instead of the credit card company as it gives them a bad name. They didn’t want to listen to us and now the tables were turned, what a cheek! They should have thought about that when they were telling us we had 2 choices....show up at the hotel or lose your money! And that is exactly what they said. We were livid. I would strongly advise people NOT to use Kenwood and strongly advise anyone else who has been ripped off to contact your credit card company straight away, you will be refunded. The reason Kenwood didn’t put up a fight within the allocated time was because they didn’t have a leg to stand on. Avoid like the plague folks!"
"Rosina , ok as i said i cant comment as i was not part of your experience , but what i was saying for someone that had a position on a support group of desperate travelers of near on 1k and not kenwood but highly recommended on here i felt some points needed some clarity .Kenwood have never home worked - so it took some time to put the systems in place for them to be able to do that. only several staff were in full operation the rest like the rest of the UK were on furlough payment ie not working.The agents that book holidays have never dealt with refunds and had to learn that task with kenwood.Abta told agents they had until 31 july to refund - not the normal 14 days. taking into account the above point and thousands of travelers to refund that was a difficult task for Kenwood.Credit card refunds costs the agent , but once in the process - they cant come out of it - they had asked you not to follow it as it costs them, but you choose the CC route - you were highly fortunate as most now ie the CC are refusing that routeyou got you money back from april to now in a timely manner , taking into account many thousands /millions have not .they were rude , maybe the expectation was to high and they couldnt cope , we have never been through this before.ultimately you got you money - many still have not so to rubbish them in the time frames you got refunded i feel is unfair. i know of people owed 25k and wont get a penny this side of xmas. my aunt spent 18k with virgin - upper class passenger - lucky if she gets it in 6 months and she was due to travel in march. there are agents that are taking the pxx and will go bust , yours paid out even via the CC route - be thankful your not in the administration route of waiting a pay out . Which could take years.Hotel only accom is proven highly complicated as most dont refund in terms and conditions whether paid or not . You in reality have no idea where that money trail was it may have been with a third party agent. Hotels in dubai that shut complicated refunds for hotel accom regardless if paid as they were expe cting to be paid.Edited: 3:03 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"Lovedogs.... ok let’s clarify this. Kenwood travel did not and never were going to refund us, not before the 31st July, not after, not ever. They gave us 2 choices as I have already explained, show up at the hotel (impossible particularly as my swimming skills are not up to scratch!) or lose our money. We contacted our CC company who told us not to correspond with Kenwood further as they would step in and take the money from Kenwood as what they were doing was not legal. So it was the CC company who refunded us not Kenwood. This was no act of magnanimity on Kenwood’s side and please don’t be under any illusion otherwise. It was only later on when the CC company informed Kenwood that they had refunded us and that they had to return the money to the CC company that Kenwood wanted to talk. How dare they, they did not want to discuss with us but now they were being selfish and wanted to ‘talk about it’ This was purely for their own gain and as they hadn’t paid even a penny to the Waldorf they had the audacity to keep our money. Under no circumstances are we being unfair, Kenwood has to shoulder the full burden of responsibility on this one and indeed of all the other irate customers whom they have treated abysmally also."
