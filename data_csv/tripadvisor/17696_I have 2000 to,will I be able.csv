"Hi Supanotts,I live here and havenâ€™t heard about, or seen anything other than paper banknotes, so I am not sure if I am reading your query correctly.Edited: 4:16 am, March 08, 2020 "
"The new series 4 notes were only released on March 2nd, and then only for 5, 20 and 200 Lira notes. They will be in use concurrently with the previous series, so Supernotts, you can spend your 2000tl as normal.From CBRT website.""E9 Emission Group Banknotes of 4th Series: 5, 20 and 200 Turkish lira banknotes were put into circulation on 02 March 2020; an announcement regarding series IV 100, 50 and 10 TL banknotes will be made at a later date.Series I, II, III and IV banknotes will be in circulation concurrently.""Edited: 4:50 am, March 08, 2020 "
"yes,I read plastic tl are coming into circulation"
"Thanks for enlightening me ScouseD. I will keep a look out for them.Edited: 5:02 am, March 08, 2020 "
"I thought they were going to be identical to the current ones, except for the signatures? And not plastic, I don't think."
"no supanotts..... so if you want me to take them to calvo tip, just drop them off to me in sherwood and ill sort it for you"
"pmsl..think I'll pass now bud,not doing Dalyan this year we are trying Icmeler"
"haha..... been there and really liked it, although it was a few years ago. more evening entertainment on in some bars... although it seems a much more spread out resort with the main town not being quite so enclosed as dalyan...."
"Be careful supanotts,you are only 10 minutes away from your dreaded Marmaris.Perhaps you could go for a visit and have a look around the beautiful marina and the old town which is worth a visit.Marmaris is not my favourite place but I did enjoy those two places."
"went to marmaris in the car from Dalyan,stayed 1 hr & went to Icmeler"
"Ah, this is where I read about the new plastic money being in circulation."
I've not heard about it. Friends living in Izmir and Kusadasi have not seen or heard anything either. Just usual paper notes. Would love to know if changing to polymer notes.
"That's good news for me, I'll just keep my lira for next year. Cheers"
I'm all for polymer banknotes. Maybe we could introduce them this year with a rub-and-sniff function too? Different types of eau-de-cologne fragrance to differentiate the bills and to commemorate the Great Epidemic and Depression of 2020. ;)
"hope it's ok for 2021 now moved this years from this Aug now,can't be doing with the restrictions,I go on holiday to relax not worry if joe bloggs 2m away"
"i agree,no holidays for us until next June,we have lovely friends at the Efe bar and Natural paradise just to name two,it just wouldnt be the same not being able to give the staff a hug.."
"I agree with you brenrobbo,won't be the same not being able to greet friends,including you.Stay safe.x"
"Thankyou turkofile, you and hubby stay safe and well and next year, we and all the other ""Dalyan Lovers""will enjoy a holiday to remember for the right reasons."
