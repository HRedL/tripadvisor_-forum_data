"How do I let you know a restaurant has closed???? Ristobar Dadaumpa in Merida Yucatan is no more. Closed down, soon to be a different restaurant."
"In the past, I have used the Improve This Listing, to indicate the permanent closure, and usually linked to either a news article, or the restaurant’s Website, if it indicates the closure.Best of luck,Hunt"
"Use this form with which you can send the URL of the facebook page where it is clearly written that the restaurant has definitively closed https:/…https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/GeneralSupport- click on ""Report a business""- choose ""Update business information""- in the ""Comments"" box send the URL of the restaurant page, along with the facebook page, asking to close the page."
Same situation as the post owner. I've tried to report property closure many times but nothing updated... Do you guys have any idea about this case? Thanks so much!
"Sheraton Grand Macao ~ did you follow the detailed steps in Reply 2?Include some official information that the business is now closed.... link to news story, official Facebook page, something"
"Hi PacificNWFamily, yes, I've also shared the link of the closure announcement on IG. But still no feedback. And not able to reach any contact point. A bit anxious."
"@Sheraton Grand Macao. On your website, I see that the restaurant is temporarily closed due to the Coronavirus. I recommend you read this topic opened by a TripAdvisor staff member https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…"
@ #7 Except that that does not always work
"Bully for you. I do, and it doesn't."
"@Joyce and Dean. This is a different situation, as the restaurant will be temporarily closed due to Coronavirus. So it is necessary that the OP follows the instructions given by the TripAdvisor staff in the topic that I sent in post # 6."
"Does not mean TA will take any action, google is far better for this sort of information, I have reported some many times, took about 1 year for TA to mark one closed."
