"Hi,Thank you so much for your speedy & kind reply on my post.Refer to the link which you have provided I think cakes are not categorised as "" Foodstuff, medicine and other articles coming from epidemic stricken area or harmful to man and livestock or those which might spread disease."" It should be quite alright for me to bring it over for my friends even with custom checking during my arrival."
