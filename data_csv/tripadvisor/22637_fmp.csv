Hello..anybody want hang out together on FMP this march??
What is an FMP?Dunno why so many people communicate in initials. Most of the time I can’t be bothered trying to work out what they are meaning.
"Cats don’t indulge in such mindless frivolity, Dodger. With everyone speaking in initials, i’d Soon get bored and wander off."
OP will meet lots of like minded people at the full moon party! on KP!...... LOL.
"OP = Original PosterKP = Koh PhanganLOL = Laughing out LoudNot that the very valuable cat goes astray ;-)Edited: 11:36 am, February 08, 2020 "
I'll be there on March 7-10 so why not
"Wonder if this FMP will be an extra quite one with Coronavirus. Actually bit surprised it hasn’t been cancelled.Edited: 2:44 pm, March 01, 2020 "
FMP won’t be cancelled. Why would it be cancelled?Are some people here advocating that mankind should stop partying because a virus is rampant 1000s of km away in South Korea or Italy?
Because other events have been cancelled.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
"As I expected, they have cancelled the FMP.https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/coronavirus/…"
#8 Yes why should it be cancelled. Bad for your local business maybe.

Lots of large events are being cancelled in Thailand due to risk of spreading coronavirus. here is one report: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
"Can bet that full moon party will go as usual despite its ""cancellation"". But it's true there are less people."
Looking pretty crowed this evening.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqneC6Bi18
"There's speculation as to whether that cam is actually real-time Jim. Local time as I write is about 9:15pm, yet sunset was at 6:30pm ish. There are people playing volleyball in full sunlight"
"It was live just when l posted.. also during the day, when i looked.... guess they shut off the live cam after dark!But it was live and much busier than I expected earlier.."
"I'll take your word for it bud :)Can I take this opportunity to thank you for the advice you take the time to give on this forum. I'll be 'doing' Tong Nai Pan Noi next year for a wedding, and some of your posts have been a great help in planning the trip. No doubt I'll be hitting you up for advice as it gets closer"
"Too bad they seem to have shut down one of the cameras, that showed the most activity ...A friend was over to Samui from KP today to do the 90 day report, Immigration was open through lunch hour as the line up was so long...(I've never seen that before).... people wanting to extend their stay.... I thought that was interesting!Still yet to hear of any cases of the virus on the Gulf Islands."
