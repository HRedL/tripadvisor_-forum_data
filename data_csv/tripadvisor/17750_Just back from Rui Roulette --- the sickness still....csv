"I just got back from Puerto Plata stay at Rui Mambo ......... If anyone has any question , please feel free to ask"
Yes...I am very curious as to how everybodys health was. Any comments?
There is still mega mega people getting sick I dont think I spoke to one person who didnt know of at least 5 people who were sick ........... I spoke to a few who had the IV treatments . I was sick for 2 1/2 days I only knew from the other guest tht if you go to the Pharmacy you can get antiboditics without a prescription. Too bad the reps cant tell you tht upon arrival. Most people do not go the the doctors extra bucks they simple go to the pharmacy. Do not believe tht this bug is a virus it is with out a doubt a bacterial. After I was sick I was so afraid to eat or drink anything. The surrounding are unreal . Simple amazing if the sickness ever gets completely cleared up I would go back in a heartbeat. Unforunately I missed out on 3 excursions I wanted to go on due to illness. Any more question pls feel free to contact me directly at wink_star@hotmail.comcheers!
"Hi,I just wondering if the staff also get sick or only the guests?What is managment doing ?"
"Hi bieke ....... I don't know if staff is getting sick as well. Management - well at every bathroom and at the entrance of the dinning lounges their are ladies with hand sanitizor, no onw getos in or out without a drop on their hand but guess what this is not enough. I strong believe it is the food especially meats not being cooked enough or prorperly the amt of food they cook is unreal mega mega food per meal. three different meals i stopped eating the meat because I didnt feel it was cooked enough. Funny the sickness is still there, someone I spoke to said there were only 2 reported case ...lol that is CRAP unsure if they honestly dont know or just trying to down play the illness there. I also beleive people who take the medication are not getting as sick as before. And it is not viral as they think why I say this? Because after I took only a couple of Anitbotics I felt much better. Viral need to take its course and only time heals.I hope this helped if any more Question or comment pls free feel to respond ."
"I am glad that I have cancelled my trip. I woke up this morning thinking ""maybe my family just should have went and taken our chances"". We were supposed to be leaving on March 28th. I have 2 kids, 5 and 7, and the thought of them roaoming around and not watching just put a scare in my bones! If anyone out there is going, I would still like to know what thier outcome is. Thanks Maureen"
Something is definatley wrong down there. I was there in January when it was an epidemic. RIU's need to see they are doing more damage to their reputation than anything!!! I am mortified that this is going on for ALMOST 5 MONTHS!!!!
"Hi Silky,I just came back from RIU Bachata yesterday, and 80% of the people I spoke too have gotten the illness. We are also all convinced that it's not viral but bacterial, 'cause we too have taken the Cipro from the pharmacy and have gotten better after a day or so. Coincidence or not, but everyone I spoke to that had the illness spent most of their time in the pool and those that weren't sick spent their time at the beach. If you can stand all the beach fleas!!!!No wonder people going in the pool are getting sick, I seen a 2 or 3yrs old boy splatter 'ca-ca' all over his legs by the pool area (poor babe!), but then 30 min later the little boy was in the pool again... YUK!!!!I'm really disgusted with my whole trip, and to make things worse... I got a nasty cold on my last day there! :(Did you guys get anything out of it? They sent us a bag of coffee to our room. "
"I just read this from an article dated February 23/05. It's on a case of malaria from Puerto Plata but the person was also treated with an intestinal infection. In a stool specimen, Entamoeba histolytica, Trichiuris trichura, Endolimax nana, and Blastocystis hominis were observed; stool cultures were negative.Treatment was initiated with chloroquine (4 doses) and primaquine for a period of 14 days; metronidazole and paromomycin were administered for the intestinal infestations. For the whole article- www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no03/04-0898.htm I would think this would be a recent case but I'm not sure.It's also interesting that the stool cultures were negative but he still had infestations. Maybe this information might help some who are still having problems by showing this article to your doctor."
"We returned 3/25 from Riu Merengue, and I agree - the sickness is still there. For our group, those that got sick were basically down and out - in bed, fever, chills, diareha. vomitting - for 12-24 hours. After that, general fatigue, lack of appetite, etc. but able to be up and about and ""enjoy"" vacation. I don't know if I'd agree on the bacterial vs. viral issue. No one in our group took antibiotics, yet recovered rather quickly. Also wouldn't agree on the conclusion that it comes from the pool, and one in our group who was sick - the first one sick - never got in the pool the entire week. I do agree the hotel is doing what they can to help stop the spread, but there is no way they can get rid of this unless they close down and sanitize everything - pool chairs, cushions, all surfaces, etc. It is a beautiful resort, but not worth the risk of illness, not to mention the anxiety of wondering ""when will it hit"". "
"Acadienne We arrived home from the Bachata on March 22 and alot of people in our group got sick. We although spent most of our time on the beach not in the pool. The funny thing in our group of 35, the teenagers didn't get sick except for 1 and we had 16 teenagers. I was one of the lucky ones but my husband wasn't. He still is feeling rather poorly. I doubt we will go back to pop and us Sunquest."
sorry about that I met to say use Sunquest
