"I am curious if the weather in the first two weeks of July are as hot and humid as in Washington DC? Also, someone said there a lots of bugs at that time of year. Is that something to consider? "
"Yes, I think the Orlando weather is just as hot in July as D.C. is, with maybe just a slight bit less humidity, but not much (I've been to DC twice in the summer). It typically rains every afternoon/evening in July with showers and thunderstorms, which will cool it down some, but then the humidity takes over again.Mosquitos can be a problem at times, but most areas do a good job of spraying for them. Still, they are out and about, so bug spray is necessary.Good thing to know is that the love bugs aren't out in July, so you don't have to worry with them. They come around in May and again in September."
"I don't know about DC weather but in Florida July = heat, humidity, rain and mosquitos. Sorry, but it's true."
"According to weather.com, the average temp in DC in July is 89 with 4.21 inches of rain. Average in Orlando is 92 with 7.15 inches of rain. Although this year in Orlando is dry so far, as was last, Orlando wins on both fronts. Orlando is terrible in the summer unless you like heat and humidity!"
"Thanks to all that replied. Living in Seattle when we have sunny weather there is usually a nice breeze to go along with it.We have been in Washington DC in July and it was pretty brutal. Didn't have the thunder or rain storms to deal with.Another perhaps silly question, but do the bugs bother you more in the daytime or evening? Or is it pretty much all the time? I greatly appreciate all of your help. Trying to decide if we should come to Disney world - Epcot this summer. Not used to really hot humid weather. "
"The times around dawn and dusk are the worst for mosquitos, but trust me, they are out all day long and all night long too.Don't you have them in Seattle? I figured with all the rain you get there, mosquitos would be epidemic-like."
My family will be in orlando July 14 to 23rd any advice. 
"Kats, info for you, Seattle is probably like Western NY, you have mosquitoes for about a month or 2, and when it is all said and done you wish you had them for 6 months. Because that would mean you had warm enough weather to support bugs for that long. But we don""t."
"BSSD,I guess I didn't think about the ""warm"" part, since we have mosquitos year round in Georgia. No matter how cold it gets in winter, we still have mosquito problems. I seemly can attract eveyone one within a 50-mile radius too."
