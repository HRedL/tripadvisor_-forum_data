"Moderna Laboratories announced their vaccine has just successfully completed Phase 1. This puts it on a time line to be available to the public January 2021. Several other companies are following close behind. Still a looong way to go before it is a success, and of course it will take many months afterwards before the entire population would have access to it. That said, great news none the less.https:/…index.html"
Definitely great news. I will take any reason to be optimistic!
"It’s good news , with a huge caveat..The trial was all of 8 people....clearly more testing and a larger clinical trial is necessary...But at least there shows promise"
I bought into this at $26 and we are having a really great day today.....but no where to spend my windfall....lol
"There are over 200 vaccines in the work, 8 more advanced. Enough people throwing stuff at the wall, some will stick."
The report I saw was that it was 45 people and 45 of 45 developed antibodies.https:/…You really should quit watching CNN and MSNBC and find a real news source
"I hope when it's all said and done that it's more effective than the seasonal flu vaccine which is only effective 40 to 60 percent of the time.""CDC conducts studies each year to determine how well the influenza (flu) vaccine protects against flu illness. While vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.""https:/…vaccineeffect.htm"
"""The report I saw was that it was 45 people and 45 of 45 developed antibodies.""I can't find any source but the one you linked that's stating more than 8.""https:/…You really should quit watching CNN and MSNBC and find a real news source.""Hmm, your link is from an NBC affiliate. Who do you suppose owns MSNBC?"
Keep looking I'm sure you can find some others if you don't like that one.
"""Keep looking I'm sure you can find some others if you don't like that one.""I hope it is true, I just can't find any other sources so I'm starting to suspect it's an error on their part."
Well I was just watching a report on FOX news and they said the same numbers...45 out of 45 got antibodies.
"9pays, great point.While this is a 'so far so good' news message , the assumption is that the vaccine currently being developed is for the current strain of the coronavirus?If it mutates into different strains, like the flu virus does, then yes ultimately any vaccine may have only a limited success rate. Better than nothing though.Edited: 3:03 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Reading the press release it says the n was 45 across 3 doses of 25, 100, 250.The press release goes on to say this:""At this time, neutralizing antibody data are available only for the first four participants in each of the 25 µg and 100 µg dose level cohorts. Consistent with the binding antibody data, mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies in all eight of these participants, as measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays against live SARS-CoV-2. The levels of neutralizing antibodies at day 43 were at or above levels generally seen in convalescent sera""https://investors.modernatx.com/news-release…"
Is anybody here fazed by the phases?
So it was given to 45 people but have only results back from 8. Phase 2 doesn't start until July. IMO by the end of the year doesn't seem possible.
"What is your source for this information ? The only report I have seen said that 45 of 45 developed antibodies and that if phase 2 completes successfully, phase 3 would start in July."
My source is the company press release. I linked it above.
The Goodbeer link also states that Phase 3 starts in July.
From what GoodBeer posted. https://investors.modernatx.com/news-release…
"I was not asking for your link GoodBeer, I was asking about BigDaddy link that says phase 2 will not start until July."

"""Vaccine doesnt mean cure. Especially for viruses""Vaccines don't cure diseases, if effective they eliminate them. (See polio, small pox, etc.) I've explained this to you before."
"""Phase 2 doesn't start until July. IMO by the end of the year doesn't seem possible.""Incorrect, it states Phase 2 ought to be done in time for Phase 3 to start in July. Phase 3 is the biggie involving wide scale human testing throughout the population countered by placebo usage as a control group. This often takes quite a while but interestingly enough the FDA approved of the use of volunteers who are willing to get infected and be part of the study. Thousands have signed up to do so. Will save a lot of time."
am i the only one that thought it was funny that placebets told upstate to look for better news sources than cnn or nbc then quotes a fox news article that was deemed incorrect?
"^^ Yup, just you"
"I linked an NBC article, and quoted FOX later and don't know that it has been deemed incorrect. Who deemed it incorrect ?And yes, you are probably the only one that thought it was funny."
For the population as a whole a vaccine helps achieve herd immunity. Estimates are about 70% need it to suppress it. (Unlike super contagious measles which needs 95%-98%. This is important as it means anti-vax morons won't screw it up.Can Covid mutate like flu requiring yearly vaccinations for new strains? It's possible although the conditions that cause influenza's constant changes are the result of it being spread everywhere around the world for hundreds of years. In fact it's ability to mutate frequently is likely a mutation itself. So yes it's a concern but it's not one to be overly so about. Plus it would only need a tweak of the current vaccine and not require they start from scratch. And a flu vaccine doesn't fail as much as they fail to match the yearly vaccine to the prevalent strain. So yes these could some day be issues for Covid as well. But it's highly unlikely they will be an issue in regards to getting a vaccine available in 2021.

It is my understanding that there were 45 people in the study. Only 8 were given the “bug”…all 8 given various bug doses all had antibodies. These antibodies are the good variety that can prevent the bug from making the majority ill. I really do not have a source other than my co-worker

"@DTC..What is the NIH position / stance on hydroxychloroquine (HC) for Covid treatment as of this week? Looks to me like they just started a clinical trial involving 2000 patients..way too early to discuss results. Fauci is involved in this trial ( does that fact lend any veracity before the results are in?). No P values yet..no peer reviewed studies complete...everybody might want to wait on that before touting a yes or no position. There's all kinds of anecdotal evidence that falls on both sides..positive ( treatment is effective/ symptoms reduced ) and negative ( side effects include serious cardiac complications, particularly when co-treated with the antibiotic they're using)...and a key thing is much of the anecdotal evidence is tainted one way or another due to which political bunker one might be in.If HC turns out to be helpful or harmful, it won't be Trump's doing..one way or another. Either the drug safely helps Covid patients or not, regardless of Trump's position on it...he nor anybody else truly knows yet.
