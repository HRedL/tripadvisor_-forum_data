Caesars Entertainment: Not wearing a mask grounds for ‘terminationhttps:/…Your thoughts.
Sounds good to me. I will have to drop by Harrahs NKC when I get a chance and see if the rules are being enforced.
My thoughts are that the mask battle is over.
"SwearingenJun 13, 2020, 2:11 PMIdeological disregard for safety precautions will be self-defeating and there isn't going to be any way to hide it."
This is simply to avoid being shut down again.
"The war is far from over. Reports are the White House just notified Congress we are withdrawing from the WHO. Based on deaths right now, the virus barely qualifies as an epidemic at this point. As for the employees, wait until one sues due to a health issue from them."
"“ Caesars Entertainment CEO Tony Rodio told employees not wearing a mask is “grounds for termination” in an internal memo. The excerpt reads as follows:“Recently, we required all guests as well as team members to wear masks while at our properties. We made this policy change because COVID-19 continues to spread in the U.S., including in areas that previously did not have many cases.Masks and social distancing have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19. Our team members are doing an excellent job complying with the policy, and we’ve been impressed that our guests are quickly adjusting to the new rule.We are working to achieve 100% compliance with guests, but we must take strong action if team members violate the rule to always wear their masks at work except when eating or drinking. ”Article continues...I’m not sure what’s left to say. Masks are mandatory. You’re an employee. Wear the mask or risk being terminated."
"Whatever one's views may be, a business is well within their rights and is in fact obligated to to enforce safety standards set by the government and regulatory agencies. A CBA has no purview over that."
"How can you possibly question this? It is a job requirement. Do you think Costco or Walmart or (fill in your own employer) wouldn't do the same. They are legally liable for most of what happens in their places of business. They have a legal liability to both employees and customers. And more than that, they are liable for YOUR actions. You want to work there wear the mask."
"My thoughts and opinions don't matter. If the boss says wear a mask, and I want to keep my job, I'll wear a mask."
"You couldn't wear a mask for a month, now you're going to be wearing them indefinitely. Dumbasses."
"*sigh* Cases started to soar 3 weeks ago. Hospitalizations started to soar last week. Tragically deaths will follow in 2-3 weeks from now. This is the progression it has followed in NYC, Italy, Spain, UK and everywhere else where they weren't able to contain a spike. (Hint: we haven't contained this one.) For those claiming ""It's different this time, only younger people are getting it!"" Nope. Spikes start in the younger but spread into the older population. The median age of new cases is rising. Last week 46% of all new cases in Florida was aged 45 and older.Our Covid denying DE has been wrong literally every single step of the way regarding the pandemic. He regurgitates every single lie propagated by Brietbart and Fox News. When they are revealed for the idiocy that they are he simply moves on to the next one. Right now it seems to be suddenly Covid is no longer deadly. In 2-3 weeks when deaths are back up over 1000+ a day, and you can count on it, he'll simply spout some new garbage Sean Hannity tells him to believe in.Edited: 3:26 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"UpstateGuy: NONE of what you said matters. It doesn't matter if you agree with the employer or not. If one of the job requirements is wearing a mask you have a choice----wear the mask or look for another job,"
I agree 100%. Both legally and ethically. Not sure how I implied otherwise.

"Great they've got the mask requirement down, now if they could only figure out how to do proper contact-tracing. https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-…"
"From the linked article:“ When someone tests positive for COVID-19, the goal is for the local health district to make contact with them within 24 hours and then contact all of their contacts in the next 24 hours, state health officials have said.But two members of the Culinary Union told the Patient Protection Commission on Monday that it took them more than a week and a half to be contacted by a contact tracer after receiving their positive results. The commission has been soliciting feedback from patients and members of the health care community as part of a review of the state’s health care system in the time of coronavirus.”Two people? That’s called anecdotal. Not much to base anything on. Other than maybe a flimsy news article on a website started by a disgruntled former reporter."
Upstate. I agree... sigh
"It may be anecdotal but in this case it matters as this is happening as we speak. Remember the ""one becomes three becomes nine"" thing back in March? Well if it takes a week and a half to contact trace it shows they are far too slow in breaking the chain of infection. Considering the casinos are seemingly burying the news of infected staff, how many more is it? Far more than two. Ten? Ten becomes 30 becomes 90 before they get caught up? That's precisely how a casino will have to shut it all down again. Nothing I've read makes me think it is anything other than inevitable. I'm predicting one will close within a week."
makes sense. not sure why this is news.

"""despite testing going up exponentially.""You need to look up the word exponentially. You meant incrementally. Far far too slowly and it is a disgrace. We needed to be at 2 million a day by now and we easily could've been.""morons are all too happy for things to shut down again""Name one. This is unbelievably tragic and the fact that there's a chance we might have to shut things down again is enraging to all of us ""morons."" ""it is quantifiably destroying the lives of tens of millions of people""It has been painful but the stimulus package helped many people deal with the economic aspect of it. It's ending soon but sadly we now need another. But you're the guy who refuses to tip Uber drivers because they may have collected enhanced unemployment benefits, so be honest, you couldn't care less about their supposed ruin.Your first three statements are categorically false before you descend into indecipherable nonsense. Try harder."
"Not wearing a mask at Sands properties will also get the employee terminated, same as Caesars properties. In Las Vegas that would be the Venetian and Palazzo. Wear a mask or look for another job. It is a State law."
"For as many years as I can remember, the Chinese have worn masks in their country on a daily basis, long before covid 19. Didnt stop it spreading like wildfire through China then in to the outside world..."
"#24Let's see, China has 3.3 deaths per million, UK has 667 deaths per million and USA has 409 deaths per million. Looks like China is doing something right. Could the masks have something to do with it?"
No brainer.Wear the mask--your employer requires it & medical experts say WEAR IT.WHY is this even a question??!!
"Chinatown, where they started wearing masks in mid-February, has the lowest transmission rate in all of Los Angeles county. It's kind of a no-brainer, if you REALLY want to open things up and keep them open, you wear a mask."
"Just wear a mask, it not hard to do and if it protects others from coughing and sneezing on you, why wouldn’t you wear one. I guess it will take people not following the guidelines and the country shutting back down and then we will hear all the complainting about that.The guidelines are there for a reason, just do your part and social distance as much as possible and wash your hands, geez!Edited: 11:30 am, July 08, 2020 "
"I have enjoyed being around some of my ugly neighbors since they started wearing masks, so I am all for wearing masks. Just Do It."
"Have to agree with Tina for a change. Why would anyone believe the numbers the Chinese government is putting out. They blew up the whole world, but now they want us to know what a great job they're doing."
He’s got a giant freaking horn coming out of his head. He’s beautiful. 13
"""And rhinoman I'm sure your neighbors feel the same about you.""Indubitably!"
"OK Tina, forget about China. How about Japan another mask wearing country and also an open society like the USA. Their covid 19 death rate is 7.7 per million. Thats only about double what China claims and way below the 410 deaths per million here."
"Tina J:""I like how ppl used China who started all of this mess as an example of great mask wearing.""Do you realize the spanish flu that killed multi-millions started in the US? Could happen anywhere. They are used to wearing masks. That's why the transmission rate is so much lower there than here. Also locking down areas did it also."
"Shockingly I agree with Tina as you can't trust anything coming out of China in regards to reporting accurate numbers. However, taking Japan and South Korea into account, it is obvious that those nations where mask wearing is more of ""the norm"" were able to stop the spread much more effectively."
It is not only in China where wearing masks is prevalent. It is common in quiet a bit of the far east.
"""It is not only in China where wearing masks is prevalent. It is common in quiet a bit of the far east.""Common sense would tell you it works. Here in the US it seems many lack that trait. As of now why do you think NY where I live is doing so much better than most of the US? Masks!! Thats why. Almost every place we go do almost all have a mask on. It's really not that hard."
"""As of now why do you think NY where I live is doing so much better than most of the US? Masks!!""......and because everyone in NY has already had Covid. ;)"
"#39. It hasn't been proven that anti-bodies cause immunity to the virus. Tom Hanks says that his doctor told him he is not immune from catching the virus again. The anti-bodies are temporary, not permanent. The reason for the reduction in NY is because we are all wearing our masks."
Dalefried...obviously I shouldn't be joking about Covid but my comment was a joke...hence the wink.
"Sorry, Darmom..... didn't notice the wink!"
"""It hasn't been proven that anti-bodies cause immunity to the virus""Yes this is true. People don't get it. There are people who were positive who again caught it. Herd immunity just isn't going to happen anytime soon. Researchers thinks it would take 20 years or more."
"""Based on deaths right now, the virus barely qualifies as an epidemic at this point...""So you were totally wrong about this not being a pandemic and now this is your new nonsense on which you want to hang your hat?"
"Since when have the NY numbers decreased? I must have missed that one. Last we all knew NYC was the worst in the country as far as COVID cases. But, even if true, I wouldn’t give yourself too much credit as y’all were forced to wear masks by the authorities there. That’s why it was so bad is because most of y’all were not abiding. 13"
"""Here in the US it seems many lack that trait.""Not only in the US. There is reluctance in parts of Europe."
"#45 - Not sure if you're serious, but NY daily cases peaked at 9909 around April 10 and yesterday there were 684 cases. I would call that a bit of a decline. Masks were mandated around April 15. Should they have been mandated sooner? In my opinion, yes, but at that time PPE was still very limited for medical professionals and the experts weren't advising masks for everyday use in the beginning.Obviously, NYC was hit very hard and it has taken a lot of work to get the numbers down. If only the rest of the country would have taken notes on what NY did wrong and what they did right, then we wouldn't be where we are as a nation.https://covidusa.net/?state=New+YorkEdited: 5:38 pm, July 08, 2020 "
"I thought the exact same thing as no. 44. Tell a new lie to make people forget about the last lie.There was a time when people who thought 130,000 deaths (and counting) in a few months was ok, would have been considered delusional. And if they opposed efforts to control the epidemic they would have been considered psychopaths. But people who fall for con men are still considered to be marks and chumps, especially when the facts about the con man are visible to the naked eye."
"5 additional employees at the Chumash Casino in California have tested positive, including a beverage server."
Good thing no one here has mentioned heading off to Chumash to order up a cold one!
"There seem to be a lot of self appointed ""experts"" on the subject. Here's another one with an extensive background. One question - Did you wear a mask last year and get your Flu shot? Will you wear a mask next year with a good certainty of a vaccine in place? (there are at least six with a decent shot creating a vaccine, two are in phase 3) There were over 60k deaths attributed to the Flu in 2018 with a vaccine. Did you wear a mask and get your Flu shot? What about the 2009 Swine Flu (another animal borne Flu)? 60.8 Million cases! I won't be a hypocrite and condemn those who chose not to wear a mask simply because I chose to wear a mask. Hopefully we can all learn from this going forward and help protect those most susceptible to bad outcomes. Please refrain from your political comments on the Travel forum. Whether we support your candidate or not, this is not the place, and your not going to change anybody's mind."
Mr. Wonderful has learned nothing.
"""60K deaths attributed to the flu in 2018""No""CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza ""With Covid with have 135,000 deaths in 4 months.....so we're currently running at 15 times the death rate of the flu as compared to 2018. And that's despite the fact that the country shut down for 6 weeks, if we hadn't maybe we'd have twice as many deaths by now."
"DTCruiser. .....retirement is not treating you well. Love your sanctimonious chattering, with a hard left slant. TomMalley - PM me and I'll share the actual numbers rather than write a novel on TA. I get 15-20 Covid related emails a day, besides the meetings, conference calls, etc. Keep in mind, I believe, as indicated above, the numbers will be much larger in retrospect, but the actual fatality rate percentage will be around 1%, and the recorded Covid deaths are highly inaccurate."
....see #52.
"Just wear the mask, don't be a dumb ass."
"Every day it will be harder to find a job where wearing a mask is not required. It doesn't matter if you are in a red or blue state. You can do what you want on your own time, but not when you are on the clock and the employer is responsible for your actions.This minority will get smaller every day."
Maybe some Hannibal Lecter style locking masks would solve the problem.
"Yeah, don't be a jackask; wear a mask."
Always wear a mask to protect against and limit the spread of the Trump Virus.
"Japan: 900 deathsUSA: 135,000One thing Japan did right..masks."
