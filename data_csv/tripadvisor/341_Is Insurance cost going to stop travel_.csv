"This Covid19 has caused major problems with people travelling and getting sick in another country. Does the insurance now that you have cover you for this . If not will insurance companies even offer this medical coverage going forward and at what cost. Many people travel now without any medical coverage what so ever and just hope for the best, but with whats happening now you think they might think twice of ever doing that again as it wouldn't be or possibly end pretty . Guess the main question will be will the cost of this medical coverage now stop you from travelling internationally or limit you from travelling? The cost for medical insurance may cost more then your actual vacation."
I heard that Toyota is offering zero percent interest on new Corollas.
The cost of insurance doesn’t worry me. Dying does.

"”Many people travel now without any medical coverage what so ever and just hope for the best”Even in better times, this is short sighted and very foolish."
"Check with your insurance company. Many who did cover all pandemics are now withdrawing all cover- at least for covid 19. but if you have an annual policy should cover you til next renewal date.insurance, if travelling to the USA from the UK/EU is very important. One stay in ICU could bankrupt you. Ie ose your house etc."
Nope won’t stop us..We have annual worldwide cover as we work in Europe as well as holidaying there & the US..
Might be different when you have to renew your policy Mike
Trouble is Mike I don’t think cover for Corona will be offered to insure against.We are covered for this year ( if we go)as we booked long before the virus was known about but insurers are saying they will no longer cover it on any new policies so should you catch it while on holiday that is a very frightening and expensive thought.
"Insurance companies will insure anything for the right price. Even Axl Rose performances. You'll just have to pony up for the more expensive policy or stay home. I'm expecting the Schengen Countries, USA, Canada, and Japan will begin requiring health insurance that covers COVID-19 to cross their borders. No insurance, no entry. I'm happy to pay more, and frankly not unhappy that many over-touristed sites might become less crowded."
Most UK companies have already said they will not cover it so either they change their minds or countries that insist on insurance cover will not get any tourist income. I would want to know I am covered and would pay but if the companies won’t sell it it’s a chicken and egg situation.
"marilynandmick, same thing here in Canada. My insurance company has already told me that they will not cover any claims against this virus if I travel to Florida again next year. I will have to look at other insurance companies that may cover this, or I will simply not travel to Florida next March."
If you are hospitalized due to Covid-19 you have a 10% chance of not making it out of the hospital so make sure you have plenty of life insurance too.
My annual travel insurance is linked with my bank account.The monthly cost might increase or coverage cut which is more than likely to be not covering Covid 19.
"Maybe the companies that only sell travel insurance will raise their prices as they have had significant losses but one of the biggest insurance companies have informed that they are not going to raise the price of travel insurances. Their reason is that they had big losses on travel insurances but most other type of insurances has costs them less than usual as the lockdown means that their are less car accidents, less personal injuries and less thefts and burglaries. I do not know if they will cover Covid 19 in the future. I am not sure that the travel insurance that comes with our Mastercard covers pandemics so I will definitely need to check up on our coverage."
"We have an annual policy, which renewed in February, however, bookings made after 12th March, won't include covid-19 cover. Anyone travelling to the states, without substantial medical cover, under any circumstances, is potentially risking losing everything. True, the Usa has arguably the best medical facilities in the world, but boy do you pay for it. You could easily run up a bill of 50-100k in just a few days, and that's if you're lucky.If our premium doubles, triples, or quadruples for covid-19 cover in the future, then we'll pay it, or we won't travel, period.Edited: 5:14 am, May 05, 2020 "

"We’ve got Covid cover worldwide until end of March 2021..Interesting to see what’s offered at renewal time, no doubt Covid will be removed from policy.."
It’s a bit like the ash cloud thing they make it up as they go along but the contracts are all drawn up in Legalise so they have a way of getting out of it. Fact is for UK travellers as long as the FCO advice is no non-essential travel you are almost certainly not insured.
"I’ve had 2 reasonable annual quotes from AXA and Avanti travel insurance, for 2 of us they are between £58 - £130, they don’t cover for cancellations etc to do with Covid-19 but will cover for medical costs including medical costs due to suffering from Covid-19 abroad. So no, it will not stop travel for me."
Sounds very reasonable WilSid..I suppose other cover will become available as this pans out??
"I would imagine they’d come out with something, but the majority wouldn’t cover a pandemic now"
"Agreed, though when you consider when the last pandemic was!!"
"Pirate this is a very good point, one that I have been raising in various threads too.Far too many people are changing the holidays from this year to next without asking their insurers if they will provide cover. A lot of Brits (me included) have travel insurance from an added value bank account package. So they are not per trip or annual but continuous if payments per months maintained, I called my insurer/bank and have been told if the booking with Disney is amended to next year they will cover but not if current is cancelled and a new one made.But you are right anybody travelling without medical covers needs their heads testing."
Perhaps our pirate would love insurance to cost so much nobody would travel but it won’t happen. If you can afford a Disney holiday at their prices a couple of hundred pounds on top is a drop in the ocean and won’t stop anyone travelling. Whether they cover for Corona itself is another matter and you may have to shop around but if you are prepared to pay I am sure you will find insurers willing to take your money.
"Marilynandmick, I totally agree with your comment, is Brits who visit Orlando every year spend thousands of pounds on our holidays. I reckon an average of about £2500 per person when you take into consideration flights accommodation, hire cars and tickets and that’s before we have visited the Ponderosa. Another few hundred pounds for insurance will be not be critical to us visiting. Those who go can usually afford."
Has anyone come across insurance that are covering Covid on new policies? If so how much more are they charging? I’m the same will happily pay more to be covered wouldn’t risk going to countries like the US without medical cover for it!!
Interesting. We use Stay Sure and I just checked what they are covering. If you take out a new policy now and catch Covid while in the States and are hospitalised or just need medical assistance that is covered as they cover all medical needs. However if you need to cancel due to isolation or catching it before you go that is not covered. I think I can live with that and be prepared to lose deposit if I had to cancel. It’s having the medical side that is the most important as we all know how expensive that would be.
Yeah M&M medical is all I’m really bothered about at the moment however I reckon this time next year you’ll be able to get cover for everything regarding Covid.

"I’ve had 3 quoted: AXA: £57.11 - £109.08 depending on level of coverAvanti: £114.68 - £190.61 depending on level of cover, 15 months for the price of 12 StaySure: £110.19 - £135.92 (£93.67 - £115.53 with a promo code I’ve been emailed) depending on cover, 15 months for the price of 12 All 3 have said they will cover for medical costs including treatment for Covid -19 as long as no FCO advice against travel destination StaySure & Avanti will also cover repatriation costs as long as no FCO advice against travel to your destination (Unsure if AXA cover this) We are 2 adults, no underlying health conditions and this is for annual worldwide cover."
So for roughly the price for one person to spend a day at Disney both of you are covered for a fortnight. That’s manageable and kind of blows Pirate Pete and his scare tactics out the water.
"Our annual family policy with the Post Office, which also covers a few “extras” & still covers us for Covid is about the £200 mark..We’ve no issues with that..We also could have got cheaper through others, though they had more restrictions..Edited: 9:56 am, May 31, 2020 "

"The prices quoted of course are for people with no health problems. If you are older and have medical conditions I think you will be looking at more like £300 for two adults but still,okay for peace of mind."
"Just another one to add:economycover: will not cover for any Covid-19 except emergency medical expenses, prices between £43.98 - £109.98 dependant on cover"
Yeah I’m absolutely ok with those prices quoted. Having had to have an operation whilst on holiday last year I will never go without a good travel insurance! Just isn’t worth the risk despite being in my early 20’s!
"Thinking of the original post “Many people travel now without any medical coverage what so ever and just hope for the best”I’ve asked quite a few folk from the UK about travel insurance, as well as reading on here & other holiday forums and most (if not all) have holiday insurance in some form or other..I wonder where the OP got that statistic from, was it just made up or just how they travel??Sadly we’ll never know.."
I agree Davy - if you can afford to go on holiday surely you can afford an extra £50/£100 or even less!
