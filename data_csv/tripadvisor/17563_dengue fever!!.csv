I have started to hear reports of Dengue fever epidemic in Mekong Delata and spreading to HCMC! Much much higher number of cases than previous years....going in November... is it sensible to stay out of the delta?
"As of to-day,is it true there is still no known cure for dengue fever?"
"They are well founded.Just this evening I met a young French woman who has spent 4 months in the Mekong and she said she didn't even use repellent!There are 3 daily periods when the winged devils (mosquitoes) are around. The malaria carrying types are airborne during dawn and dusk. Ex-pats in VN often double-dose Vitamin B following the theory that it makes the human body smell unpleasant to mosquitoes!During the day is when the potential Dengue fever carrying mozzies are airborne.You can buy a pleasant smelling cream here called SOFELLA as well as a spray repellent called REMOS which has a neutral odour. Both seem effective. You should practice daily foot care (bathing / washing) and changing socks as mosquitoes are purportedly attracted to 'cheese' smells.You should remember that many of the Vietnamese victims in the Mekong are extremely poor and do not generally use repellents. Body hygiene isn't the greatest, either, due to their circumstances.Between HCMC and Ha Noi risks appear minimal.November is the end of the 'wet' season when the sun takes over and the heat gradually increases through to April.
