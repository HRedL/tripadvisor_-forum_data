We are planning a 3 week trip to Madagascar beginning in mid-May. Does anyone have any advice regarding the corona virus in Madagascar and whether it is having any effect on tourism?
"Hello, It is hard to suggest you something about COVID-19. What can I say is that actually there is nothing in here; they close some flights and they do their best not let it enter here... since it is still the low-season here, I cannot really say that it has impact on tourism but I heard some cancelled trips... let's wait and see and will update you a ""real""situations as much as possible."
"There is zero impact at this point on day to day international tourism unless you are coming from a hotspot. Madagascar is not receiving visitors at all from China, Korea, Iran, or the parts of Italy that have been affected, flights are banned from those areas, and anyone who has transited through those places may not board a flight to Madagascar. Cruise ships have been refused disembarkation. Madagascar has imposed sanctions on carriers so if anyone boards a flight into Madagascar from an infected area or which has transited through an infected area, the airline has to pay all costs of quarantine. Good idea to keep the airlines on their toes. The authorities are doing everything they can to avoid the entry of the virus into Malagasy territory and we have zero cases at this point. At this point no one needs to worry, but certainly it will be publicised should there be cause for concern."
"In Madagascar, zero case at this moment but the health workers working at ports and airports throughly examine all passengers from abroad. They monitor their temperature, their breathing, among others. Among the symptoms of the disease are the state of fever, headaches... There are also coughs that can progress to difficulty breathing and diarrhea. Interested parties are also asked about the countries or cities they have stayed in for the past 20 days..."
"No worry yet for Madagascar. There is no case yet in the island. Do not take flight through the banned city aforementionned otherwise you will spend your holidays in a hospital for observation even if you are not tested positif.I see that you are from Michigan, so you are welcome to Madagscar. Just cross our fingers that they will find an efficient treatment in the meantime."
Any new information about this? I have booked a flight from Paris in May 3rd. Any chance that this flight will be operated?
I'm arriving from UK next Saturday via Addis with Ethiopian Airlines and hoping all will be ok. I don't want to spend my holiday in quarantine so hope I'll be allowed in!
i would love a real time update on this. We are planning to arrive on 25th March via Doha and Nairobi. The way things are going it looks unlikely but if we can come we will. Things are not easy at the moment and I wish everyone well.Thanks for any feedback
"Latest news, sorry it's in French:https:/…"
"Hi kuepper,All flights from Europe including U.K are all closed for 30 days by the gouvernement in Madagascar to prevent against the virus. So you should ask your tour agency or your driver if you booked with."
"Our holiday with Exoticca has now been cancelled. Not sure how we stand financially, looks like we are OK with the Madagascar tour BUT not sure about getting the money back for our flights. Looks like the 3 flights will go ahead but we cannot be on them. HSBC is wriggling out of compensation because FCO have not ruled out travelling to our destinations. I will let you know how we get on."
"Hi, hope all is well.I am flying from South-Africa to madagascar in the next week. Do i have to be stuck at the airport in quarantine for 2 weeks or what is the rule flying from South Africa?Regards."
"Hi everyone. The President has said that for him and the government, the cut off point is going to be that any country with more than 2,000 confirmed cases will not be admitted. I would recommend everyone contact your airlines and your agents who have booked your tours for news, although, in terms of the local industry, we are all still very busy formulating policy. On the ground here, the confederation of tourism, the association of tour operators, the national tourism office and the government have been in meetings the last few days and meeting continue tomorrow. We expect to be able to offer a unified statement by about Friday."
"By May everything could change. As much as I’m sure you’re looking forward to getting away, I believe it’s most prudent for you to prepare to cancel your trip. If the Island is still virus free, they will very likely be even more strict about travel into their country. We are being asked to stay put and we should honour that request and not put others at risk."

why don't corona infect to Madagascar
3 cases are detected in Madagascar steel yesterday
"Madagascar at this moment has 12 confirmed cases and the country is closing down, at the moment, particularly in the capital and east, but, it is likely to be only a matter of time before this is a nationwide situation. I would take a wait and see approach and do not book anything for the time being."
Suggest you cancel it. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world with ZERO health facilities in case you are infected. Prepare cancel your Tour and do this another time when the world is healthier. If you fall ill there you may not be able to come back
"An update on the situation in Madagascar:The situation has advanced quite quickly with positive cases now in Tana (the numbers growing quite quickly) and positive cases in Morondava and a couple of other places that I am not able to report on until they are officially addressed to the public by the President. Public inter-regional road transport is closed nationwide and only private vehicles with a maximum of 3 occupants, and, freight, are allowed on public highways. Some towns have put all taxis off the roads too, notably Antananarivo. All entry and exit points to all towns are manned by health personnel doing control and collecting information on movement of people (who they are, where they are going, their contact details, etc) and taking their temperature. Non essential business are closed nationwide with only food, pharmacies, and some limited other (considered essential) suppliers still open. Bars and meeting places, schools, universities, etc, are all closed. One person per household is allowed to go out to buy food from 0800 until 1200 midday. There are no domestic flights, all are suspended, and military aircraft Including the government helicopters are being used to move essential health materials around the country. There Is a nationwide curfew from 2000 until 0500. Supplies are being mobilised nationwide by the government, test kits, protective wear for health workers, etc and everyone is advised to stay indoors. Over the weekend, the government used tear gas to get people off the streets in one suburb of Antananarivo. My little town has had confirmation that we had some people here last week who were out and about around town and attended a wedding, and then upon arrival back in Antananarivo they fell ill and tested positive, so, we are going to be even more nervous in the coming days, and the governor will announce tonight the new Public security measures in place from tonight. We closed our business a week ago and we have already been in self-confinement, but, considering that we do not even have one ventilator in town, we are of course putting ourselves in tight lockdown from today onwards.Wishing all of our friends and families and the TripAdvisor community worldwide a safe passage through these stormy seas... wishing us all good health..."
"Thanks for the update Brett and thanks also for the well thought out and informative updates you are giving your Dadamanga Tours clients, including us. Take care, stay well and we still hope to be able to use your services in the latter part of next year. Testing and isolation for those that have tested positive is the key to eradicating this virus but it’s going to be a slow process.Edited: 9:26 pm, April 14, 2020 "
Any new update since the ban for flights by the President till 19th of April?
"The state of emergency (for a health emergency) was extended on the 19th April for another 2 weeks. There are no domestic flights and no international arrivals of passengers allowed at this time.General update: there have only been around 120 cases, 40 of which have been declared resolved, and there have been no deaths recorded. The city of Antananarivo and the surrounding region (Analamanga), Fianarantsoa, and Toamasina, are more or less closed and circulation is heavily restricted and departures from those cities are prohibited (although a tentative partial re-opening of schools and some other services is planned for the end of this week). Morondava, Diego and Nosy Be, and Tulear also have cases and there are heavy restrictions on travel in and out of those cities. Frankly it remains very much a ""fingers crossed"" situation here. We do not know if this is going to be the extent of it, or, if it is going to emerge in a more widespread way soon. Lack of testing means we are working blind to a great extent, the only people being tested are those with proven contact with positive cases, there is no widespread testing of the general public. General social distancing measures are being encouraged nationwide. This total estimated loss to the tourism industry as it stands now is 1,900 billion MGA or approximately 475 million euros, according to the confederation of tourism. Hotels, attractions and all national parks remain closed nationwide and while there is moderate discussion about relaunch, at this point no one is taking any talk of a relaunch this year very seriously, considering that Europe has discussed closing borders until at least September and the USA is currently still really suffering."
"Last measures announced were till 3rd of May, any update? Thanks!"
"The state of emergency was extended by the President for another 15 days from Sunday 3rd May. During a meeting last week between the minister and the confederation of tourism, there was a discussion that indicated that regional an international tourism is unlikely to reopen until September, all going well. Of course, that might change. I would recommend that everyone looks at 2021 as the most viable new date to visit Madagascar. While the borders may reopen sooner, there are very likely to be some very strict conditions that may make a ""normal holiday"" difficult or impossible. This is just my opinion."
"Great reply, thank you so much!"
"Thanks for the response, Dadamanga_Tours. My wife and I had planned to come to Madagascar this June and July, so I've really appreciated your detailed updates. Very disappointing, but hopefully we'll be able to reschedule for 2021.This has to be hitting you and the rest of the tourism industry there very hard. Take care of yourself, and I hope to see things improve greatly for everyone soon."
"Robert55229 yes the industry has been decimated. We are all just making our individual efforts to help our communities in whatever ways we can and fill in time. We are going to try to reopen a few half-days a week from next week to help people re-book for later, as long as there are no new outbreaks in town. Yesterday the Confederation of Tourism issued an ultimatum to the government for a recovery package and we will see what happens. We feel so sorry especially for the independent workers like drivers and guides, who have no support. National Parks are under additional pressure from loggers and hunters and there is currently ongoing discussion about how to reopen tourism when the time comes and protect lemurs from catching COVID-19. There will need to be modified behaviour on the part of tourists, no more wanting to touch or feed lemurs, etc etc etc. The last thing we want is that when tourism reopens, we end up killing our emblematic wildlife by infecting them through bad practices."
"For whatever it's worth, as a tourist hoping to visit Madagascar, I would completely support the measures you mention to protect wildlife -- not touching, feeding lemurs, etc. In fact, I'd be willing to pay higher rates for guides/operators who demonstrate a commitment to good practices.As far as pressures from logging and hunting, are you aware of any organizations that do a good job working on conservation that accept donations?"
"Thanks for all the updates Dadamanga. We had planned our trip for October 2020 but 2021 looks like a better option. We hope all the local hotels, tour operators, guides, restaurants and stores can survive these difficult times and we so look forward to visiting next year. Take care."
"@Robert55229 if I was to nominate any one conservation organisation I would be slapped down by the others, but, I might suggest that if you wanted to make a donation, you could be in touch with the TOP, the national tour operators association, and ask them if they will accept a donation specifically for the development of policy development towards tourism & wildlife management. This is currently vital work that is on the table but totally unfunded. Disclaimer, I am a board member of TOP. @BindH thanks for the kind words, and yes, 2021 is going to be much more sensible to aim for."
Thanks!
"Any updates on 5-18-20 regarding presidential orders for the quarantine? My wife and I have August 2020 dates of travel with limited refund/returns, so if the border is open we are planning on traveling (from rural USA). The difficulty is there are no updates online that I can find regarding the state of emergency, does anyone in state have any new information?"
"The state of emergency was extended for another 15 days from Sunday the 17th May.It is VERY VERY unlikely that International arrivals into Madagascar will be allowed in August. The government is currently working on a program to launch a national tourism campaign later in the year in the presumed absence of international tourism, and it is my understanding that it would be best to look at 2021 to visit, rather than risk anything this year.There are increasing cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar at the moment, with our first death only a couple of days ago, so, the chance of even national tourism being allowed is very unlikely unless this can be bought under control. At present, the regions around Antananarivo and Toamasina are completely shut down to all movements except freight."
I didn't see anything in the news- any update on the situation? On expectations about when travel may return to Mada?Thank you!
https:/…
Thank you Paul.I really hope that they get through this fast.I was hoping to be able to visit in August and help their tourism industry revitalize.
"Hi Shmuel E,I´m watching these pages:https:/…sante.gov.mg/ministere-sante-publique/…https://www.madagascar-tribune.com/It is a question how it is updated.I have the airticket for October. I hope the situation will be better, but watching the restrictions I am worry about the possibilities of travelling via the island ... we will see...Edited: 8:01 am, June 07, 2020 "
"The State of Emergency was extended until the 15th of June.I expect that it will be extended again, considering the increasing numbers of new COVID cases daily.Although I cannot tell you anything official, most of us in the travel business here accept that while there may be some restricted international arrivals allowed this year, we are resigned to the fact that it will be 2021 before the borders are fully open again.I would advise that if you can, you postpone your travel until 2021. But unfortunately, there are no domestic flight schedules published so to make firm plans right now is more or less impossible except for itineraries that do not include flights. Also, with regard to domestic flights, we at present have zero idea what rules will be imposed on domestic air travel in terms of social distancing, so, if for example the aircraft will only be allowed to be half full, the price of tickets is going to surely increase. So, anyone booking now for next year needs to be aware that any itinerary prepared now for next year is, at best, guess work.At the moment, there is no domestic air travel at all, and, no passenger road travel allowed in or out of Antananarivo (including the popular Andasibe), the Toamasina area, and the Anôsy Region (Fort Dauphin). Only freight is allowed."
Thank you!
Thank you very much!I have an opening to travel in August for longer than I usually would- and without our baby. So was hoping to make Mada work. I don't think we'd take internal flights but I guess we need to see how things progress. I will post again in 10 days once it should have ended.Praying for the end of this! And for everyone to be safe and healthy.
"Thank you, Dadamanga_Tours!I really appreciate all the information you put here because it is (at least for me) the only realistic idea about the situation in Madagascar I can get. I decided to wait till August and then to solve the airticket postponing which should be possible as I was informed. We will see. Thank you!"
"Hello everyone. The state of emergency in Madagascar has been extended another 15 days until the end of June. I will let you know again when there is new news.In other news, Mauritius announced yesterday that travel for tourism is closed until the 31st of August.I would not expect Madagascar to open before then either, but, miracles do happen. Something that i can tell you that is concrete is that Madagascar is currently preparing a reopening training program for the entire country, and, the final segments of that are planned for the middle of July. I am guessing any time after that they could say ""we are open"", but certainly not before."
"Thank you!We must wait. Seeing the reopening in Europe and different restrictions for travelling among the regions, maybe it will not be easy to travel around the island. But we will see… I keep my hopes for October alive :)"
thx bunches for the update. mum and i are planning a trip there in feb 2021 and think everything should be back to 'normal' then but would like to stay updated.
"@cassiesmummy The President of Republic of Madagascar makes a speech every 02 weeks. He announces the next disposition for the 02 weeks to come. We follow it step by step! Officially, the covid-19 is about to be ""under control"". For the official statistics, the number of cured started to be higher than new case detected in some of the last days. We hope that it will continue to go that way taxibrousse from Antananarivo would be allowed to work soon. Tourism services and flight depends to the worldwide situation and it will be the last to be back I think. All that I can say for now is that THERE IS A HOPE!"
