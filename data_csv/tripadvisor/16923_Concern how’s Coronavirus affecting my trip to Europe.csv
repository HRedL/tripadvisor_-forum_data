"Iâ€™m traveling from Seattle to Helsinki, with a transit flight in Paris. Somebody know if people from Seattle are having issues at the airport CDG?"
What kind of issues?
Why would people from Seattle specifically have any issues transiting at CDG because.of coronavirus?
I would hope so as Seattle is the epicenter of the epidemic in the US.
