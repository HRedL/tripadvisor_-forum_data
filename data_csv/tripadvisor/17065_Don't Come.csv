BREAKING: Foreign Office Advises British Nationals to Leave Spain after Government Shutdown of All Hotels in Spain on Tuesday
Don't come? Could not even if you wanted to...
All british nationals? even those that live there?Can't see anyone coming soon either
OP's are British Nationals so perhaps they should leave too!
Surely it only refers to British Nationals currently staying in hotels??
"Advice applies to all British Nationals I would think.Obviously those resident will tend to remain there, but if they do, then they go against the guidelines and can have no comeback further down the line.Suppose all Spain is wiped out and UK only 50%.""You didn't warn us"". Could happen in reverse of course.Bit OTT, but you get what I mean."
Nobody wants to come there. Or anywhere. The only place people want to be is Antarctica since it doesn’t have the virus. Yet.
"I can't believe people are still considering travelling, especially on a plane recirculating air, if people are going to risk it I would suggest they check their health insurance is still valid as most companies have made them null and void i've been told. All the best everyone, take care."
"Max - about 7 or 8 days ago I got a sarky reply from a 'destination expert' when I suggested people wouldn't want to be couped up in planes at the moment. Something about fresh air every 2 minutes.It's funny several destination experts saw anyone expressing caution as a personal attack on whatever particular resort they are obsessed with, 'panic-mongering' apparentlyFunny how things can change eh?But I agree the OP is probably a bit of a 'Titanic sunk' moment!Edited: 8:32 am, March 19, 2020 "
"""It's funny several destination experts saw anyone expressing caution as a personal attack on whatever particular resort they are obsessed with, 'panic-mongering' apparently""Johnincornwall how very true & not just from destination experts!! It seemed that everything I posted was either ""dramatic"" or ""alarmist"". But look at them now? Hey ho ;-) In my mind the worst place to be is an airport & plane - for that reason I have no intention of travelling to 'open' UK."
".Spot on, Violette, about how people were saying you were alarmist, just quoting the facts.Here are some alarming, ming not mist, facts just now:Spain's death toll from the coronavirus epidemic increased by 209 to 767 fatalities from the previous day. That's nearly a third more, in one day!The total number of coronavirus cases in the country climbed by a quarter from 13,716 cases to 17,147 today.Keep safe, wherever you are."
"At the time of posting i certainly felt Violettes post regarding ""renaming to Pandemic"" was alarmIST as a headline post.This issue is alarming enough without being over dramatic, posting speculation, half truths and false information. Theres enough of that on Facebook without bringing it here too.NO I am NOT saying Violette is guilty of doing that, just that we dont need it on TA. Some dozy mare was posting yesterday that the army were on the streets in the UK to keep order. What nonsense!!!"
"Mantalk says ""At the time of posting i certainly felt Violettes post regarding ""renaming to Pandemic"" was alarmIST as a headline post.""The thread in question was....https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g187…It was titled 'COVID-19 declared pandemic' which WHO (the world health organisation) had just announced. Surely to God any sensible person ^should^ be aware or *want* to be aware of all matters regarding this tragedy?Or maybe some just prefer to stick their heads in the sand?"
"To be honest everyone everywhere has a lot more knowledge regards cv19 than they had a week or so ago, pointless raking over it is now a completely different travel landscape.Atb steveEdited: 2:13 pm, March 19, 2020 "
benisteve I think it goes without saying that everyone has more knowledge now but they wouldn't had it not been for information.
"Trust me violette, the most important and factual knowledge regarding cv19 that i have got in the past week has not been gained from engaging on travel forums like tripadvisor. Atb steve"
Now that I agree with!
Changing the name given to a virus from epidemic to pandemic made no difference at all to anyone on the ground. Even WHO`s own description of Pandemic says its no more serious than it was previously. https://www.verywellhealth.com/difference-be…This sensible person chooses to get his news from official sources so is fully aware of the seriousness of this virus.

Hey Mantalk I didn't change any name - the source was WHO.
"I didnt say you did, but WHO changing the name made no difference to how it is on the ground, you were reporting it as though it had suddenly become far more serious when it was obvious to anybody that it was spreading worldwide."
If WHO had upgraded it to pandemic then it had become more serious to them. In my view it was then and still is relevant news. As for it being dramatic that is down to WHO not me.
"Please note: Mantalk has lost the will to live and succumbed to virus overload.Director General of WHO 12th March.We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do. https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-d…Edited: 4:44 pm, March 19, 2020 "
That'll do meThank you
".OK, let's change the tone on here now.We have all been worried and stressed, so a little laugh can do wonders.Posted on Twitter today in London:""Went to Tesco to buy something for dinner.So today we're having an ink cartridge followed by Light Bulb Casserole""This certainly corresponds to reports from friends and neighbours who have been to Sainsbury's and Waitrose today. Empty shelves everywhere, even at 7.30 this morning, after restocking.Face cream. No Nivea left on the shelves. Who panic buys Nivea face cream?!Best wishes, keep safe everyone."
"Re the earlier, all? British nationals advised to leave.it seems that in Benidorm some brits are being turfed out of their caravans where they live on an established caravan park, and left with no home."
"Hello mally,not just brits but other nations and indeed spanish too,those with residencia who are now displaced don't necessarily have to leave spain but i would guess arranging suitable accomodation till they can return will be a challenge to arrange and costly, the are displaced by the need to close communal facilities rather than FO advice to leave.Those that can cater for themselves regarding the above can stay on some sites.I feel sorry for those affected and those planning long stays.Good luck to them.Atb steveEdited: 4:22 pm, March 21, 2020 "
