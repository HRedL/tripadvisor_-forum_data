Am going to Bali at end of July/beginning of August and have just been told by my chemist that I don't need maleria tablets for Bali as there is low risk. can anyone confirm that this is true? Also am spending 3 days in singapore too but also don't think I need maleria tablets.Thanks
"Your chemist is right, we don't have malaria epidemic for the moment in Bali and it's not raining season when the malaria normally is on going. It also depends on where do you stay, the mountain and high population area is higher risk for malaria, while the tourist area is never catched malaria epidemic as far as I know."
"Ersano is correct is stating that malaria in Bali is not a major concern (unlike neighbouring Lombok, for example).However, for any travel outside of Western Europe (for instance, even if you are travelling to first world locations such as Canada, U.S. or Japan), I would highly recommend going to the Centre for Disease Control website for up-to-date information, and also consulting with your own travel clinic physician.The CDC travel website for SE Asia is located at:http://www.cdc.gov/travel/seasia.htmYou should find that there are currently no reported cases of malaria in Bali, but exposure to Hep A, Hep B, Hep C & STD's, TB, Polio, Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), Rabies, Typhoid, Tetanus, Diptheria, Japanese Encephalitis, Cholera, Dengue Fever, Diaherria are concerns in varying levels from remote (Avian Flu) to likely (Hep A) to almost certain (traveller's tummy if you drink non-bottled local water) in most parts of Indonesia, inclusive of Bali.That said, vaccinations are relatively safe, effective, cheap, and long lasting. And your chances of injury from accidents or sun and heat are probably your biggest concerns if you just take the usual precautions, minimize insect bites, and do mostly touristy things and minimize unnecessary risks (risks like not seeking advice from a travel physician before you start travelling in third world destinations). See the following for further information:mdtravelhealth.com/destinations/…bali.htmlFor travel advice for U.K. nationals, see:www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front…And more particularly for Indonesia: www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front…""You should ensure that your vaccinations are adequate and up-to-date.""As for Singapore, somewhat under reported and of somewhat limited concern statistically speaking is dengue fever. But best to become educated so that you are aware of the risks and appropriate precautions. See:tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294265-i1748-k584…"
