"I've tried prefilling this is to see how easy it will be and I can't get past the zip code even using the one from my hotels website. So i tried other locations in Greece and nothing works, any ideas? I am using a 5 digit number with a space and without."
I had the exact same issue. Anybody with any advice?Thanks
Thanks for posting the information as there has been so much speculation and miss-information posted on the various forums.
I’ve tried it. No luck whatsoever.Yuri.
"Did you get stuck on the zip code too, staying red and not letting you continue? If so glad it's not just me! Must be a bug."
"Is the QR (quick response form ) the same as the PLF (passenger locater form) and if not, what information does the QR code contain please?"
A few bugs apparently which have been reported back.
"Hi maggie. I reckon the unique QR code will rapidly identify your risk factor to officials in Greece, hence on arrival, some people will be directed straight for testing whilst others will be allowed to continue on. Have no idea when that QR code gets allocated to you though, (maybe at the boarding gate?), so am also interested in receiving clarification. Good question!!"
"#Passport800551 regarding the post code, I read that people have used the 49100 and 49084 zip codes, with no spaces in between and it worked fine ..."
I believe this could be in place until August 31st - now I know why TUI and Jet 2 are cancelling holidays beyong their start date. Makes sense that the Company would be jittery should god forbid a single traveller tests positive on the plane and then starts the series of reps tracking down every single passenger to self isolate. I believe that is why TuI especially have made it simpler to amend your booking up to and including the 31st August because they do not want the potential of having a whole plane load of passengers tested for one to test positive and the implications thereafter.
I cant work out how to fill in the PLF for arrivals by boat from Italy to Corfu? Its only showing one land crossing in Bulgaria and 2 arrival ports on mainland Greece but nothing for Corfu...can any one help?
"Michelle B...Jet 2 and TUI have cancelled their flights from the UK because Greece has forbidden their entry until July 15th..this will be reevaluated, tiven the covid statistics of the UK and will either be extended or allowed in from July 15th"
Works fine if you don’t have any spaces between letters & numbers
"If I'm travelling with family, do we all need to fill this form separately or is it enough if I add my husband and our children to my form? I'm confused by this sentence: ""All travellers are obliged to complete their PLF at least 48 hours before entering the country."""
"Visitors should complete (48 hours before travel) a Passenger Locator Factor form (PLF) with their contact details in Greece, effective from 6 July 2020. Until 5 July 2020 the PLF can be completed at the airport just before check-in. The PLF can also be found on the Visit Greece app and at travel.gov.gr."
"On the online PLF, after you have put in your info, you can add family members."
"I had the same question, do me and my husband both need to complete one each, or do I just do one and add him as a family member?"
Anyone knows of anyone who was tested and had to self-isolate in Corfu?
"Yesterday on the first day of flights to Corfu, 350 samples were taken from arriving passengers and the results are due probably by the end of today"
"I found an answer to my question here in the comments: https:/…""Based on our embassy info “Every person above 18 age must fill own PLF form.”"
I have same issue 7/7/20
"We are flying into Corfu tomorrow and misread the guidance on the PLF. There are 3 of us and we completed one for all of us and not one each. We have tried to submit one each, after reading this thread, but it’s too late. Any advice ???"
I have just used 84700 successfully - that is for a small area near Monolithos - no spaces.
"Actually, that's for Santorini .... sorry."
"#22. You won’t be the first to have done that. I doubt you’d have problems in Greece itself, as others have already made the same mistake, but it seems to be more the airlines who are getting a bit more picky. Just make sure you’ve got your QR code to show when boarding."
I’m posting this for anyone who needs to check up on guidelines relating to completing the PLF.https:/…
I did the same (one form for our family with my wife and daughter listed as travel companions) and this was ok according to Aegean staff. We passed security/customs without any problems or remarks. We travelled on July 20 (Dusseldorf-Thessaloniki-Heraklion)
"I have completed the form but it shows my age incorrectly. Having researched a little, it seems possible that there is a glitch somewhere. Does anyone know if this will be a problem? I cannot edit the form and I'm unsure whether or not to complete another? Thanks"
"#28. I haven’t needed to fill in a PLF so have no idea of the format. If it asks for d.o.b., which the form accepts correctly (and it ties in with your passport details) then goes on to miscalculate your age, then it’s their issue not yours. It’s becoming very clear that some people have submitted more than one form for the same trip without issue. Don’t know your travel date but you could try to complete it again in a few days, see if any glitch in the system has been sorted. Good luck!Edited: 4:12 am, July 28, 2020 "
#26. Thanks so much
Managed to fill in the old with a lot of difficulty. I hope it is filled in correctly as we are traveling in a group and it would only let me add one travel companion. It is not very clear.
"I#29 'm due to travel Friday, I may have another go tonight, as I will only worry otherwise, I didn't want to complete another form if it was going to confuse things but it sounds like it won't Thank you :)Edited: 12:46 pm, July 28, 2020 "
Due to go on 3rd August do I need to fill one out for my 17 and 15 year old or can they go on mine or my husbands
"#34. The children can be added to both your forms, which should list all those travelling together in the party. This is for track and trace purposes."
Thank you do we know who gets tested
"I added my husband to my form then realised and did him a new one, should i complete a new one?"
I did another one as you have o be on each others but the kids only on one. It seems a lot of people have made mistakes and have had to amend. I am worried sick about the testing. we have been safe but you just dont know do you. Coventry and Warwickshire are lot lower than some areas! Im praying we walk though without a problem. The first Holiday ever where i havent been excited to go.
Thank you!
"#39 Emma, I have sent you PM but also see this post I recently madehttps:/…107290777"
"Plf form say 1 for family, Can some one tell me is it every person must fill form or one is for all family , I add my husband on my form , didn'thave option to add my child she is 16 years old"
I did one per person including the kids. We went last week and they seemed to look at all 4.
"Hi,When completing the passenger locator form I have not been able to enter in my mobile number, it suggests to add a + at the start of the number which I have done, and then tried with the 0 and without the 0 at the start of my number and still not recognising it.Can anyone give any suggestions? Thanks,"
Hi have you tried +44 then your number without the 0 e.g. +447777000000 - this worked from me.
"Thank you, I was being a doughnut and didn't think to do that!"
Hi..I have filled my form out .. The email came through and its got my age wrong...!! Would that be a problem?
"Seems to be a common problem. Not sure what to advise to be honest. Need someone to come forward now with the same issue but who’s already travelled, see if it adversely affected the process at all. Hope you get an appropriate response!!"
"So we filled out our PLF last week, when the guidance was to have one per adult (and to tag the kids to one of the adults). The latest guidance is to have one per household/family. I tried resubmitting a new PLF for my family but it says that I already am in the system and cannot make a new one.Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do? Will we have a problem if each adult has their own PLF?"
"#50. No, you should not have any problems at all. The authorities will take account of the fact that people have already submitted PLF’s."
Thanks so much for your fast reply. I've been stressed for the last 24 hours thinking we'll be denied boarding/entry.
"I'm also struggling with competing the form - my flight number has 3 characters instead of 2 (EZY for Easy Jet) and the system doesn't recognise this flight number. I deleted 1 character and was able to move forward but the flight number would be incorrect in that case. Also, for temporary address in Greece I'm only able to add 2 addresses but I'm going to stay in a few more places on Crete island. You have to list all addresses for 14 days according to the instructions. Can anyone advise on this please? Many thanks"
"Did you try entering 3 letters and the flight mumber figits with no spaces in between ??..as for the address, it is nessesary to put the first one, so in case you are found positive, they can reach you...so where you'll be for the first 2-3 days is important"
Put U2 then just numbers of your flight with EasyJet. For example mine is U21977 worked perfectly. ( flight number from Flight Radar
Thank you all.Has just arrived in Crete. I would say no one really cares about this form here. Someone just quickly looked at the QR code not even checking the form/how many names are on it (we came as a family). But in London Gatwick I was asked to show the form a few times. Our flight was full and non of us had to take Covid test either. So Greek people look quite relaxed here.
"#56If you landed on Saturday evening, I am not surprised that they will be understaffed and not very diligent."
Coronavirus doesn’t take the weekends off unfortunately..........
Re #58 - not just Greek staff missing in action - friends came back to UK last Saturday evening from Majorca - nobody asked them for UK passenger locator form !!!
"Apologies as this has probs been answered before but can't find it - i've read conflicting info regarding the PLF- do i do one to cover my wife and i or do we need to do one each ?? , the form i just completed advised one per household and did allow me to add my wife to it , however i've read elsewhere it shpould be one per person - what is correct ?? thanks in advance"
One per family. They changed it.
Can anyone tell me if we have to complete another one of these forms to get back in the uk after our holiday in corfu?
#63. Yes you do. It cannot be completed until 48 hours before your return flight.Here’s the link to the form.https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-d…
"I did two, when I filled in the PLF it only gave me an option to add 1 child so both myself and my husband did one. I’m assuming that won’t be a problem - I can’t change it now as we fly in less than 24 hours?"
