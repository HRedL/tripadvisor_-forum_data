"Hello fellow travelers,It would be great if you can share your arrival experience at the KEF airport from 15th June onwards. Going by the newspaper reports, their has been extensive planning done to welcome tourists."
No personal experience (also interested in that!).I've found a newspaper article with some pictures: https://www.visir.is/g/20201980473d/svona-er…
"There is an article in Icelandic at https:/…The gist is ""Screening for the crown virus among tourists began at Keflavik Airport today and has progressed well"".One passenger was turned back, but it wasn't due to health screening. A US national had boarded a flight from the UK and was turned back at Keflavik, as only Schengen + UK citizens are being allowed in.Edited: 10:39 am, June 15, 2020 "
I'm very curious to know the results of the first days of testing. When there is any info about that in local (or less local) media can someone please let us know?
"Awaiting reports from people on the ground as well. In the meanwhile, CNN report: https:/…h_8e2ff11534b6dcaab7a818bbed86eb04"
"Perhaps this article would be helpful ?https:/…One US citizen turned back at the border on a Wizzair flight from London, probably missed the new July 1st entry for non-Schengen. Apparently most passengers on that flight were Icelanders."
"I am also watching this topic like the proverbial hawk. A new worrying factor is the nurses's strike scheduled for June 22nd. In addition to striking in clinics and hospitals, they are also saying they will cease swabbing for covid at the airport.We are British and have Icelandair flights and British Airways flights for July. I am a British doctor and we have both had Covid19 several weeks ago. We have made a full recovery but we are getting repeat tests soon just to check we are not going to give a positive result at the airport. This can happen when the person is shedding dead virus and is no longer infectious. I am really keen to know the figures for this week in terms of how many positive results and from where."
Here is some information about the first day of testing:https:/…https:/…
"Interesting that Wizair allowed the US citizen to board. I'm thinking he should have been turned away before ever getting on a plane.And the bit about officials able to turn people away who ""look like they won't quarantine."" What does that mean, I wonder? What criteria are they using to make that determination?"
"Thanks Kim.I don't understand how it is possible to be so wrong in the number of passengers that would be arriving? The number of flights is known and so should be the numbers of passengers on each flight?I sympathize with the people wanting to hug their loved ones, but indeed that is not very reasonable at the moment.Also, one article says that all arrivals opted to be tested, while the other says that some of them opted for quarantine, so I'm not clear how many tests have actually been conducted. Eagerly waiting for the numbers!Edited: 8:34 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Update from the press conference that started about 45 minutes ago: Around 927 people were screened yesterday, and two positive results were found - one is a Dane with antibodies, so not an active infection, and one is an Icelander who has to go into quarantine.It isn't clear how many people on the plane with the positive result have to quarantine. There have been an increase in the number of quarantined folks over the past few days, up 53 people, but I *think* that also includes the ones who were exposed to the Romanians who were arrested over the weekend.One other note, they apparently lost a handful of samples from yesterday, and have to call those people in again for more testing, so it is possible that more positives will show up, but it is hard to say right now."
Thank you so much for that update. I thought that the testing capacity per day was a maximum of 1000 tests. This makes me wonder how they will cope when more flights start coming in as there are currently very few flights arriving compared to what is expected from July 1st.
"Out of curiosity, why were the Romanians arrested?"
Three of them for theft and burglary. Then another 3 of the same gang found and they had given false addresses and contact information when they arrived claiming they were quarantining.
A#11 The maximum daily testing is now 2000/dayhttps:/…
"Nothing new in this article, but they do make it a point that the tracking app is important for visitors. https:/…Here is a link to info about the tracking app:https://www.covid.is/app/en"
Many thanks for the updates about the tests. Hopefully all this will go well for Iceland and its people.
Great! There’s no news on what happened to other passengers of the plane where there were positive cases.
"@Soph5035, I agree, when they say they are expecting 650 and over 900 show up, something is not working as it should. Problems on the first day, perhaps, but with a firm test limit of 2000/day, as flightsincrease over time, it is important to ensure they know how many will be tested. I'd hate to think of whatmight happen if more than 2000 show up for testing one day.These were the arrivals on 6/15 from KEF FIDS:Time From Flight Airline Status 10:10 London Luton W94497 Wizz Air Landed 09:48 10:35 Copenhagen SK595 SAS Landed 10:51 14:45 Oslo FI319 Icelandair Landed 14:24 14:55 Vagar RC401 Atlantic Airways Landed 15:10 15:25 Copenhagen FI205 Icelandair Landed 15:31 15:35 Frankfurt FI521 Icelandair Landed 15:46 16:00 Stockholm FI307 Icelandair Landed 16:00 16:30 Copenhagen FI207 Icelandair Landed 16:26 * The flight schedule is updated by the airlines and ground handling agents. The information is subject to change.Perhaps they are not getting passenger numbers from airlines other than Icelandair. But it does seem strange."
"The presser also said that Isavia will be working with all airlines, starting 2 weeks in advance, to make sure the total numbers are low enough to not overwhelm the testing capabilities. That doesn't seem to be working perfectly yet, though, and it is also unknown what would happen if the airlines plan to have more than that number. Do tickets get cancelled? Who knows!"
"Lajesli,This is why the police now have this power:https:/…""Meanwhile, the Icelandic police now have the authority to assess individual arrivals at the border screening stations and, based on their own assessment, decide whether or not any given arrival will be likely to abide contagion guidelines. If the officer believes the individual will not abide such guidelines, the officer has the authority to turn them away at the border. This is in direct response to recent news that a group of visitors who arrived recently did not go into quarantine at the address they provided.""If you click on the recent news link in this article, it gives the rest of the story."
"Amit S, The original requirement was than any passenger seated within a 2m radius of a passenger who tests positive upon arrival KEF would be contacted and placed in quarantine.Then they decided to require facemasks for all passengers, and the quarantien for passengers near theinfected passenger was dropped.""Icelandair works in cooperation with the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, and masks will be required on board the airline’s aircraft for the first weeks. That way, should a passenger turn out to be infected, it won’t be necessary to quarantine other passengers on board.""https:/…06/08/icelandair_to_offer_service_to_11_destinations/However this is only Icelandair, and the infected person came in from CPH - so, on Icelandair.Not sure what happens if an infected person arrives on an airline that does not require passenger masks. SAS does, but not sure about Wizz Air or others flying into KEF."
Today Iceland Air notified me that my August 6th flight from the US to Munich was cancelled and I was rebooked a day earlier for both legs. Not sure if you can read anything into this? Maybe people are cancelling so they are consolidating flights?
"Hi Drr49,Thanks for the info but link is not opening. Anyway, if face mask can help avoiding the Quarantine, then I think other airlines will follow the suit, at least the ones originating from Europe due to flight duration. Mine is Icelandair so hopeful that quarantine may not be needed."
"Thanks, drr49, for posting that article! I had seen some speculation about this, but I had completely missed that news report. (In the Icelandic version at https:/… they didn't mention the face mask/quarantine thing at all.)"
"If you do test positive once arriving, does that mean you must quarantine in Iceland until such time as you test negative again? Anyone know if they've published guidelines regarding this yet?"
"I also had an advice that my Icelandair flight on Aug 8th from Paris was changed, but at least I still leave the same day (I have to rebook my train to Paris though, but I'll wait closer to the date as I'm still not sure I will actually travel)."
Sorry about the bad link...here is one that works(I hope)...https:/…
"Hey, no need to be sorry:) and yes it works!"
"Amit S, thanks for letting me know. I hate broken links.Iceland regs do not require passengers near a passenger who tested positive to quarantine.A question came up about other airlines, and these airlines (besides Icelandair) plan to fly to KEF this summer:https:/…Air BalticAtlantic AirwaysAustrianCzech AirlinesLufthansaSASTransaviaWizzI've checked their sites and ALL airlines above require face masks, so there should be no problems forpassengers who test negative, but came in on a flight where someone did test positive."
"Lojeslj, After you test at KEF you are free to go to the location you have listed, as you wait for test results.If you test positive, you will be called in for further testing to see if you have an active infection.Should you have an active infection, you will go into isolation and begin the treatment process.""As of June 15, passengers authorized to travel to Iceland can choose to be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival or to go into quarantine for two weeks, according to a government announcement. At this time, test results from other countries will not be accepted for exemption of quarantine. Passengers are required to fill out a preregistration form before departure to Iceland. Testing will be available at Keflavik airport and in Seydisfjordur (for passengers arriving on the Smyril Line). As of 1 July, passengers will be charged ISK 15 000 for a single test. Following the test, passengers can travel onward to their registered address (provided in their pre-registration form). Passengers can expect to receive their test results within 24 hours. Those who test positive will be offered to undergo further tests to determine whether they have an active infection. In the case of an active infection, the passenger must self-isolate. Children born in 2005 and later will be exempt from quarantine and screening requirements. Passengers are encouraged to download and use the COVID-19 app Rakning C-19.""https:/…news""Isolation is required for those individuals who have a confirmed COVID-19 infection or are suspected to have that infection, but do not require hospital stay. Then you are isolated at home (self-isolation) or at locations specified by the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management or by the health care system. While in isolation the staff of your primary care clinic will be in touch with you daily. It is safe for individuals who have a confirmed COVID-19 infection to stay together in isolation.""https:/…how-does-isolation-workHope this explains adequately what happens if you test positive. Sorry for the breaks in the text, but this is a cut and paste job, and I think this is the info you want."
"Thank you for the detailed response. I guess my bigger question is, when do you get out of quarantine? As a physician, I know that patients can shed virus for weeks. At what point are you allowed on an airplane home? I haven't seen anything that details what comes after a traveler is placed in quarantine."
"Like others here, we got notice this morning that our mid/late August flights were changed. I was glad to get the news now so that I can start in on that. Not sure yet if I will go for a refund or a voucher, but we plan to reschedule this trip for August 2021. I have already cancelled everything for this year and have started rebooking for next summer."
"Lojesli, as a physician you know more about the medical aspects of this than I.But lets look at what happened the the 2 people who tested positive; both were called back for additionaltesting, tests of the foreign national showed covid-19 antibodies so this individual was deemed to be freeof the active virus and released to proceed as desired. The other case, the Icelander, proved to have an active case of the virus and was placed in isolation (not quarantine - these are two very different things).https:/…So in your case, when you get to KEF you will test, and then go on to your listed destination to wait for thetest results. If you tested negative, you are free to travel as you wish. If you test positive, you need to returnfor additional testing. If the testing indicates you have an active virus, you will be placed in isolation, where you will receive treatment (if necessary).Before you can be released from isolation and get on a plane home, here are the requirements:""What are the discharge criteria after COVID-19 infection?Physicians in the COVID-19 team at Landspitali University Hospital decide and discharge patients from isolation through a phone interview. Individuals have to confirm that they fulfill the following criteria:- At least 14 days have passed since a positive test result (diagnostic test)- At least 7 days of no symptoms""This may also apply in your situation:""Symptom-free individuals: This refers to people who, for instance, have been diagnosed with the virus after having been tested by DeCode Genetics (Íslensk erfðagreining) and have been free of symptoms for at least one week. The person is released from isolation 14 days after having tested positive for the virus. To be symptom-free means to have absolutely no fever and absolutely no cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, fatigue, or feeling of being ill.""https:/…how-does-isolation-workYou know more about the medical aspects of a viral infection, but from what I read, IF you test positive onthe initial test, and IF subsequent testing indicates an active virus, even if you have no symptoms, youwill be there for 14 days. So, a positive test on the first try, followed by a positive confirmation, means youare not going home for at least the next 14 days.But this is just how I am reading the info put out by Icelandic authorities. Perhaps others may read the above and see it a different way. As you well know, a second opinion is always a good thing."
"Thank you, that was the information I'm looking for. I'm glad they are using antibodies as well as the PCR test, as some people do seem to shed dead virus for weeks and weeks after infection.This is probably all moot as I'm fairly sure I had it back in April, after picking up my daughter from her ""need to leave the country now"" flight from Australia (no study abroad this semester!) and her finding out the next day one of her Australian friends tested positive. She and I were both sick 5 days later with weird symptoms, but no fever or cough. Who knows? Interesting that some Europeans find the cost of the test prohibitive. That's a testament to their healthcare system, as $120 seems not too bad to me."
"So, some potentially bad news. It looks like 22 people were put in quarantine from the flights, due to their proximity to the people who tested positive: https://www.visir.is/g/20201981686d/tuttugu-… (the link is in Icelandic, sorry!). Víðir Reynisson said that is because there aren't rules in place yet from the European Aviation Administration on masking on airplanes, so it might be that those folks weren't on a flight that required masks? There isn't enough information yet to say for sure."
"So much back and forth on this issue. I wish we could get some clear answers on what happens when seated near a covid-positive person, and if and what variables affect what happens. E.g. if you're within 2 meters of the person, do you automatically have to go into quarantine? If you wear a mask, but that person doesn't, do you have to go into quarantine? Vice versa? If you both wore masks but there aren't official rules in place yet from the European Aviation Administration, do you still have to go into quarantine because they just assume you didn't wear masks?"
"Unfortunately what's happening seems to be is exactly what the official covid.is website says, and it doesn't mention any face mask dispensation...""A negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not later be required to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to infection, e.g. on the flight to Iceland.The contact tracing team interviews those who have been in close contact with a confirmed active case during two days prior to the onset of symptoms , e.g. been within 2 meters of an individual for more than 15 minutes, or those who have sat close to an infected individual on an airplane (usually within two seat-row radius). They might be required to self-quarantine for two weeks from the time of last contact. ""https:/…tourists-travelling-to-iceland"
...But 22 quarantined from a single passenger found positive?
"""Two seat row radius"" that can mean 5 rows (the row of the passenger, two behind and two in front) x 6 seats so it's possible.Edited: 10:57 am, June 17, 2020 "
Right. :-(
"I'm sure you all have already seen this, but just for historical record-keeping purposes, 851 tests were done yesterday, with two positives. Those two are being tested for antibodies now. (A policewoman was also found positive yesterday, probably in connection with the craziness and arrests over the past weekend.)"
"Oh, and there is going to be another press conference tomorrow."
"@MechTeach : I hadn't seen the numbers for yesterday, so thanks for adding them. But how do 851 tests relate to the 1400 people that arrived, according to the article you linked earlier? Or is it because of children that do not get tested?"
Does anyone know which was the airline? I mean was it the one where masks were mandatory?
My understanding is that all airlines that currently operate flights to Iceland require face masks.
"MechTeach, thank you again for the updates and I would be interested to know what is said at the press conference tomorrow. My specific concerns are how the system will cope with the number of flights arriving as these increase week on week and also the potential effect of the nurses's strike.I am guessing that the 1400 v. 850 is accounted for by children and returning Icelanders who can opt for 14 day quarantine instead of testing."
"@Soph5035 and @UnaW, yes, I have been wondering about that large discrepancy as well! It seems crazy that the gap between 850 and 1400 is entirely children and quarantining Icelanders, but I suppose that is possible. It's hard to get any news today with it being National Day, but I'm hopeful that there will be more details at the presser tomorrow.For the flight on Monday, I *think* that was from Copenhagen, if I remember correctly, which I believe would still be SAS right now, which definitely requires masks. However, just this morning, the police had to go to KEF to make a person on a flight just arrived from CPH put on his mask, so maybe it isn't strongly enforced in the air? Who knows?"
"Am also concerned at the 22 people told they must quarantine through being on the same flight as the Icelandic resident who tested positive. The Covid.is information suggests that a person can be recalled for more assessment if they were close to an infected case but mentions a 2 seat row gap. I assume that if we were recalled in such an instance, we would have our antibodies checked which would show that we have had the virus and are for the time being immune. I think I would trust the Icelandic health authorities with this. It is possible that we may find out via the press conference tomorrow that the costs and logistics of having tourists now outweighs the benefits to Iceland. Hoping this is not the case but am prepared to cancel/postpone if so."
"More informations (in icelandic)https:/…Translated through Google:""Twenty-two had to go into quarantine because of passengers in flight on their way to Keflavík who arrived in Iceland the day before and became infected. Asked why it is and whether the distance limits have not been respected in the machine, Víðir says:""This is just working on the rules of aircraft proximity. There are those who are closest to the person in the machine who have to quarantine. Now that the masking duty has been placed on passengers, we have asked the European Anti-Doping Agency to issue new instructions on how to do this. We are still waiting for a conclusion in that regard. """
@wosco - That is a funny auto-translate of EAA! It should be more like the European Aviation Administration.
"#48 : if you have caught the virus from someone you are sitting next to on the plane, you will not have antibodies yet, and you may not even have a detectable virus load yet. You develop antibodies at the end of an infection, and the majority of people have not been in contact with the virus yet. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your point.Also, I don't think there is definite proof yet that having developed antibodies does confer lasting immunity (if someone has a reliable link that says otherwise, I'm very interested). Two positive passengers out of nearly a thousand tested is not a bad number (and that's two days in a row, right? or do we still have the results only of the first day? I'm getting mixed up). I was worried it would be higher. If Iceland has the capacity for testing it can be a workable solution for now (but not sure it's workable for months)."
"@MechTeach You're right! But if you just put ""Sótt­varna­stofn­un Evr­ópu"" it translates ""European Disease Control Agency"". Interesting..."
"@Soph5035 - If I recall correctly, I think #48/@UnaW is a UK doc and already had it, and has antibodies, so for her(?) that is probably a relief and big factor in terms of how they are doing quarantining. I also agree that ~2/1000 is a decently low number for the risk of catching the virus. I would be a bit more concerned about a 22/1000 chance of being quarantined, though! Hopefully we will get more clarification soon. @wosco - The auto-translations of Icelandic are often so funny. I guess the machine learning algorithm doesn't have enough practice!"
"Agreed with MechTeach. Maybe I'm naive, but I feel fairly confident that I can take all the possible precautions at the airports/on the airplanes to not catch covid (and will also test right before the trip to make sure I'm not already sick with it), but I feel far less confident that I won't be seated near someone with it. 22 in quarantine from one person is a very high number."
"Hi everyone, any new intel on how long before you get the results of the test? Also, do you need to quarantine at your accommodation until you receive the results or are you free to walk around the city e.g.? Planning a weekend getaway to Iceland soon. Thanks"
"Oh, sorry for UnaW then. I thought the message was generic, not personal. Sorry for misunderstanding. Yes so someone in this case would surely be released from quarantine (I hope?). Mattdog, until you get the results of the test, you are suppose to stay put and keep social interaction to a minimum. I think I understood from the article (but not sure) that many people actually waited at the airport? It must be only a few hours before you get the results (it's not a small feat to manage to do this)."
"The covid.is website says that results will be sent by text within 24 hours. If arrival is after 5pm then it may be longer than this. So I would not wait at the airport but move on to our hotel in the city and keep interactions minimal eg takeaway dinner. Soph5035, , I am a British physician who has had proven Covid19 last month, as has my husband. We have been checked after recovery as fit to return to work and I have good levels of the key antibody (against RBD, the surface spike protein of covid19). True, we do not know how many months or years we will be immune for but I will bring confirmation with me and am perfectly happy to be tested again in the same way as the passenger from Copenhagen who was allowed to go as he had evidence of only previous infection and had antibodies."
"One more tiny trickle of news from today - the two infected passengers were on flights from London and Amsterdam, the antibody tests from those passengers are still awaited, and Isavia anticipates that there will be ~762 passengers tested today."
"So, an update. 700 tests were completed yesterday (17/6), and 1 positive was detected. No news on the antibody tests for the (16/6) arrivals.https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/06/18/eitt-smi…"
I think that an average of 1 positive per 500 tests is going to be a reasonable guess for at least the next few weeks. Is Iceland prepared to pay that as a price to have that many tourists ? If they are expecting or hoping to be declared Covid19-free and remain that way then I do not think this is achievable if aeroplanes are landing daily with foreign tourists. They may be able to keep their overall numbers low enough for the local health and infection control services to manage and perhaps this is the goal.
"Today's press conference just ended. They said that they were going to have three more of them next week. There wasn't a ton of useful information, especially with respect to how quarantining was going to be implemented going forward on airplanes, and there were some contradictory statistics, but this is the main thrust of it:1) At the very beginning of the presser, the news said that 632 samples were taken at the airport yesterday, and 68 at a hospital, but then when Þórólfur started talking right after that, he said that samples were taken from 540 passengers. Confusing. Still, just one positive, as mentioned before, and antibody testing on that passenger is pending.2) In addition, of the six detected so far, 4 have antibodies. For the one case that is active, 20 people have had to quarantine (this could be rounding, since I think they said that 22 people had to quarantine earlier in the week). 3) Þórólfur is pleased overall with these numbers, but said it is too early to draw conclusions, other than to say that the screening has been shown to be necessary.4) Alma said that the SMS notification system has been a bit iffy with international numbers, but using the app has been very reliable. The app has been updated, and is available in Icelandic, English, and Polish. 5) They are a bit concerned about disruptions coming from the nurses' potential strike.6) Páll says that people screened at the airport should expect notification within 12 hours. 7) There was something about how internal border control is being relaxed on Monday due to Schengen, but I don't know exactly what the point of that was, so I'm hoping we get some clarification on this in some follow-up articles.There was also some discussion about the size of gatherings yesterday for National Day, but that isn't relevant to this thread!"
"The only way to remain COVID-free would be to keep the borders closed or at least strictly enforce 14-days quarantine for everyone who enters. So I don't think they are expecting that, they are aiming for a balance between keeping numbers low and saving the tourism industry.I am glad I still have a few weeks to make up my mind and see how it goes..."
"Found a better translation of the quote yesterday:""“This is simply based upon the rules of proximity on aircraft. Those sitting the closest to the [infected] person on the flight will have to go into quarantine. Now that it has become necessary for passengers to wear masks, we have asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for new instructions on how to arrange things. We are still waiting for a conclusion on that front.”When asked, Víðir said that no serious issues arose from the obligation to wear masks.“We haven’t heard of anything causing major problems. Sometimes people don’t wear masks, but when the need is highlighted, people oblige.”""Still no real answer on if and when this would change, so I really hope they have more to say on this soon."
"Thanks again MechTeach, this is really very helpful to us and gives a flavour of the current thinking behind how the process is working. My last day to decide on cancelling my first two bookings is Monday but I guess I will have to take a chance on that for now."
"As the testing process at KEF continues, interpretation of the rules change.One item of particular concern for those planning a trip thru KEF is what happens if another passenger on my flight tests positive for covid-19. This came out about the same time that Icelandair posted that face masks would be required on all flights begining 6/15:https:/…This is in the above link; ""Icelandair works in cooperation with the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, and masks will be required on board the airline’s aircraft for the first weeks. That way, should a passenger turn out to be infected, it won’t be necessary to quarantine other passengers on board.""As masks were required, to seemed like there was no need for quarantine if another passenger tested positive. But the EASA (EU Aviation Safety Agency) never agreed to the above, and as a member of EASA,Icelandair (and all other EU airlines) must adhere to their requlations.EASA has issued the ""Covid-19 Aviation Health Safety Protocol"", which defines actions airlines must take.To see this pdf document, go to this link and scroll down to the download.https://www.easa.europa.eu/document-library/… If you download this document, you can see that it goes into very specif detail about how an airline shouldhandle problems caused by covid-19. It does not address the nature of the problem at KEF - passengers who test negative but have been exposed to a passenger that has tested positive for an active infection, but section 3.5 deals with ""the management of passenger on board with covid-19 compatible symptoms"".The passenger displaying symptoms is supposed to be placed in an isolation area, with 2 rows of seats cleared in each direction around the suspected passenger. ""Passengers who were seated 2 seats in every direction from the suspected case may be considered close contacts and will need to be interviewed....if the suspect case is confirmed.""The EASA is still in the process of evaluating the bebefits of face masks for passengers in close contact with a passenger who does test positive for an active covid-19 infection, so the above process may change in the future.But for now, IF another passenget tests positive upon arrival in KEF, that passenger will return for further testing. If it proves to be an active infection, passengers seated within 2 rows of the infected passenger will be contacted for quarantine for 14 days.At least, that is how I read the EASA regulations, but others might see it differently.Bottom line for now is that if you fly to KEF, and another passenger on your flight proves to have an active infection, and if you were seated within 2 rows of that passenger, you could be quarantined."
">> Bottom line for now is that if you fly to KEF, and another passenger on your flight proves to have an active infection, and if you were seated within 2 rows of that passenger, you could be quarantined. <<Just to add to this, for those planning trips that are for periods shorter than 14-15 days, keep in mind that you will likely have to remain in Iceland for the full 14 day quarantine period. If you develop symptoms during that time, and retest positive, that 2 week period might have to be extended by another week, or longer depending on how ill you become!"
How ever.. I am quite impressed the way Iceland is working towards opening up... they are making the most of being small/ one point entry/ focused on tourism which allows them to practice methods they have put in place. There will be some uncertainty but each day they are taking a step forward towards creating a sustainable system to handle this Pandemic as well as their economy. Infact what they have started by testing all incoming passengers is minimising threat to highest extent to any other country as on date. So as said it helps being small and they are putting all their efforts to make best out of it.. I am confident that within a month there will be much more clarity and Iceland will be leading opening up scenario for others...
Thank you MechTeach for the report on the press conference. Would you mind updating this thread with the new press conferences (next week now I suppose?).
"@Soph5035 - Yes, no problem! I find this whole process very fascinating. The only news from today so far is that 702 tests were done at the border yesterday, with one positive. Again, no follow-up information on people added to quarantine, or antibody tests. Hopefully, we will get a more comprehensive picture with the meetings next week!"
"Yes, I'm also very interested in how the situation evolves. I think it's a very unique opportunity to have some understanding about the spread of the virus, and kudos to Iceland for pulling it off. All through these weeks Iceland's strategy has produced information that will be helpful to the whole world.I also have my own selfish interest as I have a trip through Iceland to Greenland planned in August and still on the fence about whether to cancel or not (if it's not cancelled by the company), so that helps me understand my odds."
In this article they mention 20 people in quarantine after 2 were found positive (with active infection).https:/…
Here a short interesting interview to the chief of the testing lab.https:/…index.html
"I am also very curious if the rule is still in place, that passengers who were seated next to someone who got a positive test will be in quarantine. Wizzair's seat allocation still does not care about Corona and allocates the worst seats (middle seats next to already occupied seats, although lots of empty rows). So I would also like to know if airlines allow to choose empty seat rows while boarding or ask to stay at the allocated seat. In the past it was not really a problem to move to empty seats, but mostly after take off (but then I would have been at two different seats, increasing the number of people nearby). Otherwise if everyone changes seats, how will they be able to know who was near someone with a positive test?My flight is tomorrow and I am really nervous about my trip...just in case I will take my laptop to work from the quarantine center :)"
"One more update (from https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/06/19/tvo-ny-virk-smit-greindust): it appears that the positive case that came in yesterday has antibodies. The two new active cases are both police officers involved with the arrest of the Covid-positive Romanians, poor guys. One of the officers is almost certainly going to miss the birth of his 3rd child due to quarantine (his wife is 39 weeks along - poor lady as well!). Given that information, it appears that the 22 people quarantined so far are from adjacent seats on flights for one or *maybe* two active cases, and that policy is likely to continue for a while. @tobi1164, maybe you would want to take a picture of the seat you end up in on your flight, just in case?"
"I just saw that I also have to fill in the seat number on the governmental form that we are supposed to hand over...so they might take the seat information from there. Good idea to make some pictures as proof, hopefully surrounded by empty seats."
"Quick update for 19/6: https:/…thrju-smit-greindust-i-gaer735 people tested, three positives. No follow-up information on number with antibodies, flight(s) the three were on, or number required to quarantine."
posting the link in English would be much more useful.
You can use Google Translate if needed and MechTeach summed up the most important info. There may not be a link in English with that info yet (on this website the most recent info in English seems to be from June 18th : https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/06/18/covid-19… ).
"I m now waiting for the test result in the hotel. The test was very quick, they took samples from mouth and nose (quite hurtful). Regarding the seats in the airplane, after boarding was completed, they asked to spread to empty seats. They handed out forms with personal details and hotel information which they collected before landing. Also upon arrival you save some time if you already pre-registered on covid.is . Otherwise there are lots of self service displays available to get the barcode for the test. All in all, very well managed!"
"Yes, sorry, the links in English come out about a day after the ones in Icelandic, but Soph5035 is right that Google Translate does a decent job!@tobi - Thank you so much for the on-the-ground reporting! I hope that no one was around you on the airplane and that it is smooth sailing for you!Edited: 3:29 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"Hi Tobi,Thanks for the ground report and I wish you all the best. Was your flight Icelandair?"
"Mathlady, why fo you always come across as rude/unfriendly? It's as if you are constantly annoyed by other posters..."
@tobiIs your final destination Iceland or do you have to wait in the hotel before you can continue on to another destination? Thanks.
"This is what is ""by the book"", but I'd love to hear tobi""s personal experience with this.""While waiting for test resultsPassengers do not need to self-quarantine until they receive their test results, but should take preventive measures to protect themselves and others from infection. Please stay at your residence and avoid being out and about and do not use public transport if possible (e.g. use rent-a-car or taxi rather than bus or domestic flight). Wash your hands and/or use of hand sanitizer regularly, avoid touching common surfaces, avoid touching your face (eyes, mouth and nose) with unwashed hands, and respect physical distancing (try to stay 2 meters/6 feet from others).""https:/…tourists-travelling-to-iceland"
@amit: it was a wizz air flight@gerry: my final destination is iceland. We got this message (https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/grei…) printed at the passport check and they told us also at the hotel that we are supposed to stay here until we get the notification.So if your flight is arriving in the evening it is much more comfortable to wait overnight for the result. We made the test at about 4:30pm and just now 9:00pm the result came by text message...negative :))
"Happy for you tobi and thanks for sharing your experience. Have a great time!Edited: 5:46 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"Fantastic news, tobi! Have an amazing trip!"
"Thanks for keeping us up to date, Tobi! Enjoy your vacation!"
"From yesterday, 20/6, 961 tested at the border (11 flights arrived!), 1 positive (not tobi1164!). Data in English available at: https://www.covid.is/data"
Thanks Tobi and good news!What happens to people that are flying on to another destination after they are tested? Do they have to wait for the results before flying onwards?
"It is not a given that you can use Iceland as a springboard to fly onwards. For the time beeing only those from EU/EEC are free to travel around (most of) Europe, with some exclusions for countries with high virus spread. This may of course change later on. If you test positive, you may not travel anywhere till you are symptom free, out of isolation and give a negative test. If you are quarantined due to having been seated near someone testing positive, you are free to travel after your 14 day quarantine providing you do not develop symptoms/fall ill."
I am not sure how they will manage the travelers from the U.S. There is a high chance that they will get more positive cases at the airport once they open the border for the U.S. travelers. The U.S. currently has very high cases compared to the EU countries.
I think it will be quite some time before the borders are opened to North America.
"@tobi, that is great news, hope you have a wonderful time. Question, if you have time.....did you take a shuttle bus in to Reykjavik from the airport? I noticed in your linked documentation they say to ...""avoid public transport"", until you get the test notification.II am curious if you or anyone knows if Fly-bus or Grayline are doing any social distancing for their passengers. I've traveled on then 3 times, and it was always a full bus. I don't think there is any requirement to wear a facemask on busses in Iceland, and most everyone on the bus will have been tested, but with unknown results. This may just be part of the chance any traveler takes when going on a trip these days, I am trying to decide on the risk; I'd hate to get a get a negative test result, but later display symptoms of infection picked up on the bus ride in."
"What will happen when somebody have had covid already and is not infectious? Do I understand correctly that first test will show only either currently infected or already healthy, but the second test is required to say which one? (Meaning people who had covid and had antibodies will have delay before they can travel even if non infectious??)Thank you."
"As far as I have understand the procedure, if you test positive they will then do an antibody test to find out how far along in the infection process you are.If you have antibodies to indicate that you are already past the point of being a danger to others you can continue with your plans. If the antibody test is negative, meaning you have a current infection you will go into isolation.So if you test positive I guess you would have to calculate with at least an additional day in the city for further testing, even if you then test positive for antibodies (which not every person develops apparently). That may also depend on what time of day your flight arrives, though."
"Thank you, additional test without taking new sample I suppose, right?"
"The second test ( antibody test ) is a blood test and will take place in a clinic or hospital in Reykjavik. The first test at the airport ( the antigen test) is a swab of your throat and upper part of the nose.They are unlikely to be able to do both the same day unless you arrive on a very early flight and your initial airport nose/throat swab is processed very quickly indeed.So if you know you have had proven Covid 19 in your home country and fully recovered then you need to make sure you stay in the city area for your second day unless you are prepared to be called back. Of course, your initial swab test may be negative but some fully recovered patients will shed dead virus particles for many weeks and thus have a positive swab but are likely ( but not guaranteed ) to have blood antibodies."
"Another press conference has just ended! This is a long post, sorry, but here is the gist of it. I'm guessing there will be articles posted with more info soon.1) On 21/6, 762 samples were taken, with 0 positives.2) Since the border opened, 5500 tests have been done (including private flights and the Nordic ferry), with 11 positives. However, nine have an old infection and are not considered to be truly positive, so only two are considered active and in isolation. Later in the presser, he said ~7000 people have entered the country, and no one has had to go to the hospital. 3) Þórólfur said some things about how the number of persons in quarantine have decreased (probably just naturally over time) and they anticipate that future quarantining from flights will only add to this number in a minor way. I don’t think this has anything to do with loosening the 2m/2row rule, just that contact tracing isn’t as extensive for someone who has just arrived on a plane? Maybe we’ll get more clarification on this later. He also said that no Covid infection has been confirmed in flight so far - not sure how they would know this if they didn’t do some sort of follow-up testing.4) Þórólfur is clearly *seriously* relieved that the nurses strike has been resolved.5) There is no more passport control at Schengen borders. 6) There was chatter back and forth at various times in the presser about how there are normally more than 2000 people coming across the border, what happens if more people want to come in than that (later in the conference they mentioned up to 9000 people per day might want to come, would they stop testing given how few cases have been found), etc.? The general response was that testing has already given them a lot of information, and it’s good they have another week before there is increased border opening to gather even more info (which will be compiled and shared, I don’t know where). They *might* consider ramping back testing, or only doing it sporadically from countries where there isn’t as much incidence of infection, that that will be data-driven, and not decided yet. 7) Þórólfur said the countries that are most concerning are the US, Brazil, Russia, and India. It is unlikely that screening will be reduced for anyone coming from those countries. *However,* he also said that many of the countries that are showing a decrease in infections have stopped testing as often, and so those numbers aren’t completely reliable.8) Lots of discussion about how long antibodies last, and T-cells, etc.9) Some concern about the border screening missing cases - the response is that clinics are encouraged to continue taking samples and screening and searching. Basically, a “constant vigilance!” type approach, but not a stressed-out one.10) Víðir says that nobody has chosen to go into quarantine instead of being screened. 11) Some talk about the upcoming election and the northern earthquake, and then some stuff about self-service dispensing in stores or something? I’m not sure."
"Thank you so much. Very interesting. There was previously mentions of 20 or so people having to quarantine because they were seated next to a positive person, was that mentioned again? For the 2 cases who were actually positive and active, how many people were actually asked to quarantine?"
"Really interesting and valuable information, thank you. I had been concerned about the increasing numbers they would have to cope with in the border testing service . Icelandair alone are adding extra flights each week from London. 2 flights per week this week, 4 per week next week and 5 per week after this. If this is reflected in other airline schedules then the numbers of passengers will be quickly increasing."
Thank you all for very valuable information!
"Thank you MechTeac, for such an interesting update.I share the same concerns as Soph5035. No news on that subject?Grazie! :-)"
"No news on the quarantine situation at all! (As far as I could tell, anyway.) They had that little discussion about how people haven't caught Covid on an airplane, and also about the total number in quarantine decreasing, but nothing specific about the number in quarantine from the two cases. Bah! I kept hoping one of the reporters would ask that!"
"Hi thereI flew in from London Heathrow yesterday with ICELANDAIRThis is my experience1.I had to register on the website - covid.is and then save the barcode I received (I just took a screenshot and saved it in my 'photos' on my phone).2. I downloaded the app ""Rakning c-19"" (**THIS IS IMPORTANT**)We had to wear masks etc on the flight and once we landed we were checked three times for our bar codes on our phonesWe then lined up and got the throat swab and nose swab. Nose swab was definitely a bit uncomfortable and strange - but there is no pain. It just feels odd,You then proceed to immigration to give your passport etc and they give you an info paper on what to do and what the regulations areYou then collect your bags and are free to leave the airport.I got a taxi (my family owns taxi/transport company in Iceland). I had to sanitise and sit in the backseat and lift my own suitcase etc into the boot.I had to maintain social distancing with my family and was not able to hug hello or use shared food utensils etc.4.5 hours after landing, I got a text to say I was NEGATIVE.I was happy to hug my family!!The officials told my aunt that if you have downloaded the app then you usually receive your test results first - so I do recommend you do this.If you are tested POSITIVE, you must go to hospital (they tell you which one) for a blood test to see if you have the antibodies or if you are contagious. 14 day quarantine may then ensue. It is currently free of charge if you require accommodation to do this.Of course - on my return back to the UK I will need to quarantine for two weeks. However; I decided to risk this as I came to Iceland to attend a funeral and then will be spending 2 weeks here with family.Hope this helps.Selma"
"Another thanks to MechTeach for these accounts of the press conferences - all details most welcome!Has anybody any idea of how long the Icelandic contact tracing teams took to trace and contact other passengers for quarantine after the airport testing found two active infections? Or how long they took for earlier domestic cases? Appreciate that they've only just started with the airport screening, but they have been doing this for a long time with the general population.We have a trip booked before the pandemic was announced, starting 5th July. Current plan is to leave booking the car hire and some of the accomodation until after we've had a negative result from the test. We have the worry of booking all these expensive things after the negative test, then later being called into quarantine because of a positive test for someone else on the plane."
@Selma T - Thank you SO MUCH for that detailed account. That is tremendously useful! I'm so glad that you were able to see your family - that is a terrific use of this very smart policy by Iceland.
"Rob, I share your concern. We booked our accommodation 8 months ago and have kept them all. They are cancellable a few days before the date of stay. In our case, we are staying the first night in Reykjavik and hope to head north in the afternoon of the second day. By day 4 we should be up in the remote West Highlands and an awfully long way to have to head back to Reykjvik for quarantine. I had my blood taken today at work for covid antibodies ( currently being done for NHS staff only). I expect mine to be positive after swab-positive Covid in May and wonder if Iceland would allow positive antibodies as a get out of quarantine card . Even so, it would be a long drag to get us down to the city again for testing.Edited: 2:09 pm, June 22, 2020 "
"My understanding is that they will not use prior test results from another lab, and will swab you for Covid first. If it is positive (as #106 mentions), they will draw blood and if you have antibodies, you're considered non-contagious and can go about your trip. No antibodies assumes new infection and quarantine.While the jury is still out on how effective the antibodies are, or how long they last, I believe overall this is a reasonable strategy to get people moving about the globe again."
"A follow-up article has been posted about the press conference that *slightly* clarifies some things I found a bit confusing in the morning meeting (in Icelandic): https://www.visir.is/g/20201983553d/tveir-fa… I'm going to be lazy and just quote Google translate into English from the relevant part of the article:""More than twenty people have had to quarantine because of those who have been identified at the border. However, quarantine will decrease now because new flight risk definitions are being implemented after the introduction of new quarantine measures by air passengers.""We are redefining it in accordance with international guidelines and then the need for quarantine for in-flight passengers, although diagnosed as an infection, will be much less than before. But I would like to point out that no covid transmission has been confirmed in flight so far, although there is a suspicion of international transmission. "" ""This still a bit hazy about what this practically means, but it is slightly more than what we knew before."
Well that sounds promising at least. Thanks MechTeach!
"Thank you so much MecTeach! It can be read as good news, although unclear..."
"Through google translate, this:View to stop screening tourists from certain countries 22.06.2020 - 15:58National · Civil Protection Information Meetings""It is possible, in accordance with increased awareness, that we may stop screening from certain countries or nationalities,"" says Thorolfur Gudnason, epidemiologist. It is still possible to screen two thousand a day, but it is clear that seat availability will be far above that at the turn of the month. Thorolfur Guðnason said at a public information conference today that statistics on the risk of tourism by country were being prepared. ""We get very valuable information with this screening on risk areas and can probably handle the screening accordingly in the future,"" says Thorolf. He says the virus is most prevalent in the United States, Brazil, India and Russia. See also: Two travelers with active infection per week - 20 in quarantineFrom which countries could screening be stopped and when?

"There is a very useful first-person account from someone who was quarantined after being near an infected person on a flight on reddit: https:/… This seems to answer many of our questions, but raises some other ones!"
"Argh, pressed ""reply"" too soon. The main information is that while the poster was in Iceland, the authorities changed the quarantine radius from 2 rows to 1 row, based on EU guidance. Also, the poster was notified about the negative test about 6 hours after arriving (notified in the evening), and about the quarantine the next day."
"I'm sorry to post 3 times in a row! Just a data update - there were 843 tests at the border yesterday (22/06), and 1 positive."
"I thought I saw discussion somewhere about if your are wearing protective gear (N95) they aren't necessarily quarantining you. Is there any truth to that?Also, it is now a one row radius - is that include the diagonals? so if you are in the window seat, the row directly in from to you, across from you and behind you but what about the diagonals? For instance if I am in 7A then 6AB, 7CDE, 8AB are one row radius but are 6CDE and 8CDE also considered one row radius?"
"I'm hoping that the poster comes back and provides clarification on how the rows are counted. All of this data from the ""Iceland experiment"" could be very useful in determining future policies, mitigation practices, etc.More news, too, from a different source today. Sorry that there is a paywall if you read too many articles: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/world/eur… . This isn't conclusive for Iceland travel, of course, but it is a potential concern for people from the USA who are hoping to travel there."
"MechTeach-Just saw that article. I am hoping that since Iceland is not an EU member that they will not ban US travelers. I know they are Schengen and had originally pushed back their original June 15 opening to outside the EU for Schengen compliance BUT they are testing to control. Now if after a few days/weeks of seeing higher positives coming from the US, then I could understand if they shut it down...We are arriving July 3. Fingers Crossed."
"I don't blame any country who would close the border to U.S. travelers. Many people in the U.S. are acting like there was never a virus. Too many people just don't care. They never believe in mask wearing, which is a very simple measure to protect others.We don't deserve to mingle among populations in other countries that are working hard to keep this pandemic under control.If U.S. travelers are allowed to travel to other countries, a lot of them might not abide by mask requirements and other measures and that might put other countries at risk. I don't want to sound rude but If I were a resident in Iceland, I'd feel a lot safer when U.S. travelers are not allowed to enter Iceland during this pandemic.Edited: 7:19 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Hello again, everyone. Here's the update from the tests yesterday, and the press conference (which started a bit late due to technical difficulties). 1) 1413 people were tested at the border yesterday, with 3 positives (these numbers include both the airport testing and the Nordic ferry testing). They are very pleased with the results so far, but are still going to be careful. For example, Þórólfur wants to delay the next increase in the size of gatherings (to 2000 people) by one week.2) Páll talked a bit about border logistics, and said that the current screening booths will need to be reconfigured to keep people from N. America and Schengen separate if people from N. America are allowed to enter.3) A reporter asked a question about letting people in from outside Schengen. Víðir said that the Schengen countries will be united in their decision, and that will be announced by the end of the month. Þórólfur was asked about how he felt about flights directly from the US, and he said that people are upset about that happening, and that the screening will have to be especially careful if it does happen. (Side note - um, I would hope that all of the screening would be careful, regardless of origin! Otherwise that defeats the purpose of the screening....)4) Víðir was asked if the Schengen policies or epidemiologist's opinion was more important. He said that the epidemiologists have had a serious level of input into everything, and that was considered very heavily.5) Some discussion about whether the testing price will be too high and discourage tourists. No one wanted to answer that conclusively, and said that is entirely in the hands of the ministry (nb: though Páll is part of the ministry, so??). There were some other things discussed - how long alcohol-serving restaurants will be allowed to stay open at night (past 23:00), the possible creation of antibody certificates, etc. - but these are the main points. My feeling, and this is just my feeling from what I saw, is that it is unlikely (but not impossible) that US people will be allowed in on July 1. From some of the leaks yesterday on the EU deliberations, it is *possible* that Canadians will be admitted, but there are no scheduled flights on Icelandair from Canada for at least the published schedule on the website, so who knows how that will play out. On an economic level, the assumption from the passenger numbers the last few weeks might be that Iceland's tourist industry will be able to survive on Schengen alone; of course, the EU is probably letting in some countries outside of Schengen, so maybe Iceland will also see a big jump in Chinese tourism, who are apparently on the approved list. I'm also interested in how this will affect Icelandair - from their current negotiations, they appear to be counting on the income from the sharply increased bookings from the US very heavily, and without that, their calculations might need to be done again."
"Thanks again MechTeach. From what I read on other forums, there are some US tourists who are hoping to enter Europe through Iceland, counting on the absence of border controls inside the Schengen area. If Iceland still go on with the opening to US tourists while the rest of Europe doesn't, I can't imagine that there will be no border controls exiting Iceland. On the other hand, if all US passengers are tested in Keflavik and quarantined if they are positive, that means that the ones who enter the rest of Europe are safe (minus the false negative...). But can Iceland afford to act as the quarantine house of Europe? Even if people pay for their tests, that is an awful lot of work."
"Really appreciate these updates, MechTeach. Very interesting point about the economic effect on Icelandair if travellers from the USA postponed further. I do not envy the authorities in Iceland their difficult decisions on tourism value v. infection risks and logistics of testing.It seems the current system is not far off the daily capacity as it is so unclear what will happen as numbers increase as soon as next week, including flights from our location of UK. If testing is going to be done in a more targeted way, this would make sense to me. I await the outcome of these discussions while we tentatively progress to packing our Osprey bags. We had not wanted to jinx anything so far."
"Thank you for the thank yous, Soph5035 and UnaW ;-). I'm very interested in what will happen with your trip, Una, with respect to the presence of antibodies for you, and with the similarities between the US and the UK in terms of the general order of magnitude of per capita testing and infections (though the UK is doing much better than the US now, thank goodness), and how that will play out with positive rates in the testing in Iceland.For US-based potential travelers, there has been a follow-up interview with Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir (Justice Minister) now on MBL (in Icelandic): https:/… There isn't a lot of new info there, but she said that Iceland would like to be more open than much of the rest of Europe, thanks to being an island and doing the testing, but that there must be reciprocity in terms of allowing Icelanders to enter other countries as well."
"Thanks for the updates MechTeach!''it is *possible* that Canadians will be admitted, but there are no scheduled flights on Icelandair from Canada for at least the published schedule on the website'' - This is very interesting and confusing. Originally their schedule included Toronto (2 x week initially and 3 x week starting July) and I see now that it's been dropped. I have no clue why! Thanks for pointing that out."
"@CURIOASA - Interesting! I didn't know that there had been flights from YYZ. I wonder why they dropped them? Canada entry to Iceland seems much more likely than US entry.Also, as another nail in the coffin of US travelers' hopes for a visit to Iceland, this article (in Icelandic) just came out: https://www.visir.is/g/20201984506d/oliklegt… I understand where they are coming from, but it is also a bit contradictory. If they are so sure of the efficacy of the border testing, then this wouldn't be an issue. Again, though, things are looking bad in a number of US states right now, so the concern is understandable."
"I think it's time I give up hope. Between this, the need to quarantine if someone near me on the plane tests positive, and the fact the flight prices are going up each day now, I'm trying too hard to make something work that just doesn't make sense at this point. European friends, this American is very envious of you and how your governments handled this pandemic :)"
"Question for people that already travelled to Iceland in the previous weeks or plan to do so shortly.DId/will you pick up a rental car at Keflavík airport directly after arriving? Or will you wait for a negative test results and then get a car in e.g. Reykjavik short notice without a reservation?On the one hand, you're supposed to quarantine anyways and I'm not keen to having a unrefundable booking for a couple of weeks in the worst case scenario. On the other hands having a reservation makes me feel better and I'd also prefer to take a rental car to the first hotel over taking the fly bus...Any opinions?"
"We have reserved a hire car and intend to get it when we arrive. We arrive ( hopefully) around 4pm and we may get our results late that same night but more likely the following day. Allow 6 hours if everything running to time and not too busy but I imagine it is getting busier day on day.Last time, an employee of the hire company drove us to the office in a minivan as it is situated off site so I expect it will be similar this time. We will pick up the car and head to our downtown hotel for the first night.Better car hire deals if pre- booked and I cannot see it will be practical for anyone to await their results in the airport terminal.Edited: 2:28 am, June 25, 2020 "
"We have also booked the Car airport-to-airport. I think the moment we step into the airport, it is a risk. But I would not want to be in a situation where I pay exorbitantly higher sum when I do the booking only when I test negative. Even if I test negative, there is a chance that I may be called for quarantine after few days as someone else is tested positive in my flight. So it is a risk and I would suggest to go ahead and book. Check if they can do some adjustment in case you return the car early."
"We immediately got the rental car on arrival. I would not plan the trip according to the small risk of being positive or quarantined. We were just careful, wearing masks and keeping distance but in the arrival hall noone else was wearing masks (also never saw masks again anywhere).Edited: 8:41 am, June 25, 2020 "
"Right, that's what I was thinking anyways, thanks for confirming my gut feeling :)"

"this has obviously become a rather long discussion, so excuse me if my question has already been answered somewhere in the depth of these 130+ contributions...what I wonder is:If you are tested positive, do you really have to (aka are forced to) spend the 14 days of quarantine in Iceland, before being allowed to fly back home? Is that only an educated guess or a written fact?thanks"

"That's what you can read in the FAQ's page:""Will I be sent home if I test positive?No. You are not allowed to travel if infected."""
"If you have a history of previous proven Covid infection and test positive on the swab at the airport, you will be offered antibody testing. If you have antibodies against Covid, you will not have to quarantine and can resume your plans. I do not know if everybody who tests swab-positive is automatically antibody tested or only those who know they have already had the illness.This is because a small percentage of fully recovered Covid patients continue to shed dead virus fragments for several weeks and this results in a positive swab test even though they do not have a current infection and cannot pass it on to others. These are the patients with anti-Covid antibodies on blood testing."
"Thanks for the explanations. I think we will not travel to Iceland then, the risk of being quarantined is just too big, especially if that only happened because somebody else sitting near you was tested positive."
"Covid.is has been updated - if I'm reading this right, then the chance of being quarantined because of somebody else on the plane testing positive has got a lot smaller. ""In the event of an obligatory self-quarantineA negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not later be required to self-quarantine if they have been exposed to infection, e.g. on the flight to Iceland. The contact tracing team interviews those who have been in close contact with a confirmed active case during two days prior to the onset of symptoms , e.g. been within 2 meters of an individual for more than 15 minutes, or those who have sat beside an infected individual on an airplane. They might be required to self-quarantine for two weeks from the time of last contact.The following applies if the individual was wearing a face mask (medical mask) and adhered to guidelines regarding hygiene and infection control as recommended. If those conditions are not met then the situation is evaluated and who needs to be quarantine possibly expanded.Contact tracing is done for passengers within the 2 rows around a SARS-CoV-2 positively tested case. Contact tracing is performed in general from 24 hours before his/her symptoms started (from 24 hours before diagnostic testing if asymptomatic). All these passengers should be informed about the exposure. Only passengers sitting directly next to the index patient will be defined as close contacts (high risk exposure). If the index patient sat on the aisle, the person sitting on the other side of the aisle will not be categorized as close contact (unless there is another indication, such as a travel partner/family, direct touch, coughed or sneezed on).As a result, in most events, there will be 1−2 close contacts, all other persons would be contact persons with a lower risk of infection (low risk of exposure)."""
"This is fantastic news! So if you are a family of 3 sitting all together in 3 seats, there is low chance of being in high exposure category. This is getting better day by day."
"There was another press conference today at 4 pm. I'm going to be brief in this summary, which is not necessarily chronological with the announcements in the presser, because it has been a crazy day with work. 1) A LOT more people have to quarantine in Iceland ASAP. A women's soccer/football player came back to Iceland with crazy-high levels of the virus (which was not detected at the border screen - ruh roh), and there has now been community transmission over the last few days. Oops. 2) The price of the test (as of July 1) has dropped. It will be 9000 ISK if ordered in advance, 11000 ISK if paid on-site. 3) It seems pretty conclusive now that Iceland will follow EU opening guidelines. This wasn't *explicitly* said, but was heavily, heavily implied.The rest of the time was more urging to be vigilant, to be aware that ""this foe"" is not yet defeated, etc. Cheers!"
Mech Teach has been doing a great job keeping us informed. Just want to add this link to help explain what has been mentioned above about more quarantines: https:/…
"60 Euro for the test is much more reasonable, knew it would come down."
I am travelling from the UK on the 20th July. At the moment I am able to cancel accommodation and car hire with a full refund. I am concerned about the risks of testing positive or being asked to quarantine due to other passengers testing positive. Is it looking likely that testing will be stopped or certain countries made exempt?
"well, I am sure that even if some countries will be made exempt, the UK won't be among them"
Why would they stop testing?
"Testing will continue up to the capacity of the system which I understand is 2000 per day. They may decide to exempt some countries but I agree that the UK is unlikely to be on that list for now.I would suggest getting an antigen ( swab ) test done eg 10 days before your holiday. There are ways and means to do so if it is not offered via your occupation. If you think you may have already had the virus, then get antibody testing done. It is available privately but do one with full blood sampling, not a finger prick test.If at the time of travel you have no symptoms suggestive of covid you have a very small chance of being a carrier, having an early infection or having the illness without symptoms. And a very small chance of being close to an active case on the flight over.Travelling abroad this summer is a huge gamble and it depends on what your appetite is for the risks involved."
The couple who got quarantined and then un-quarantined tell their story.https:/…
I feel that reading this may encourage people to see what they can get away with if they are told to quarantine. I hope the health care authorities become stricter in enforcing quarantine measures as they gain more experience with testing and dealing with the results.
"Agree with Kim T. You can’t just go around since the enforcement language wasn’t clear enough. But I think since the definition is changed for the quarantine requirement, there will be less and less people needing to go into quarantine."
Another press conference at 2pm today.https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2020/06/29/thrieykid_bodar_til_bladamannafundar/
"There was an article published this morning that said that 22 cases have been detected at the airport since opening, but only 4 of those are infectious, fyi.Edited: 8:26 am, June 29, 2020 "
"Keflavik airport publish scheduled arrivals, now July 1st is included. My flight from Oslo is there, hurrah ! so are several flights from around Europe/Schengen. But none from US."
Do we know how many people needed to be quarantined? That is my most concern if I’m going to book a flight from Amsterdam.
"All we know is that out of approximately 12000 people screened at the airport, there have been 4 active cases. Each of those four will have been associated with the quarantining of their close contacts, presumably including those who sat close ( ? one seat row or two ? ) on the aeroplane. That is not a large number of positive cases and I suppose someone with a mathematical brain could calculate the odds on being affected if arriving passengers continue to have a similar prevalence of infection. The odds will change however if a country with higher case numbers is admitted.The recent cluster of infections seem to relate to a footballer who was an Icelandic citizen returning from the USA and who developed Covid 19 symptoms s few days after a negative border test. This is always a risk because people may travel when they have no symptoms, test negative and yet be developing an infection which they can pass to others before they even know themselves."
"No, we do not know exactly how many, just those seated close to the infected. None at all if your flight has no positive cases. Up until now there has been 1-3 positve tests among 900-1400 passengers per day. Passenger number is likely to increase after July 1st though. Download the app Raking Covid-19 and you will find day by day numbers."
"The press conference today wasn't super-informative. Most of the time was spent:1) Telling the people of Iceland to not relax, this is still an ongoing fight, please be aware and vigilant, etc.(there seemed to be some frustration that people are no longer listening to the ""holy trinity"" and their advice), and2) Discussing the case of the female footballer who came back into the country and later tested positive, and what this means for sporting events in general.There seemed to be a bit more nervousness about the wider opening of the border on July 1, and they said that they are looking at various scenarios, but nothing definitive was stated."
Hello! Thank you all for all information here. Have you heard about Iceland allow EU citizens to bring covid tests from home country? Or any changers on quarantine if another flight passanger nearby test positive? Thanks
"You cannot bring test results from home. The logistics of having them translated and figuring out if they are valid or forged would be too high. You need to get tested on arrival or go into 2 weeks quarantine.It currently says the following on covid.is:The following applies if the individual was wearing a face mask (medical mask) and adhered to guidelines regarding hygiene and infection control as recommended. If those conditions are not met then the situation is evaluated and who needs to be quarantine possibly expanded.Contact tracing is done for passengers within the 2 rows around a SARS-CoV-2 positively tested case. Only passengers sitting directly next to the index patient will be defined as close contacts (high risk exposure). If the index patient sat on the aisle, the person sitting on the other side of the aisle will not be categorized as close contact (unless there is another indication, such as a travel partner/family, direct touch, coughed or sneezed on).As a result, in most events, there will be 1−2 close contacts, all other persons would be contact persons with a lower risk of infection (low risk of exposure)."

Thanks for sharing your experience. Two more weeks until I'll be there myself hopefully...
I am glad all was ok in the end but interesting how systems are not as efficient as they should be. It will be our turn to experience this tomorrow afternoon.
"Please let us know how it goes with you Una, and I hope it's a smooth process and that you will not have to wait too long for the results of the antibody test. and be cleared.It seems my own trip in August will be a go after all!"
"We arrived in the morning of July 1st, or plane from Oslo were just half full and no other planes arriving at that exact time. Everything went quicker than we had expected even though not all testing booths were manned. Test itself from the nose unpleasant, but nothing to worry about. Wearing masks on the planes and at Keflavik airport.Picked up the rental car and went to our accomodarion. We arrived in the morning and negative test result came the same afternoon through the app. You will have to be prepared for and accept that you will loose a few hours of your vacation, personally I were overjoyed that I could go on a trip that I had mentally written off."
"Hopefully we will not need antibody tests. We have had recent swab tests at home and are now nearly 2 months since our illness. Am reasonably confident that we will be swab negative and thus not need any additional tests. We are a mix of excited and nervous for this trip. Which is unusual for us, but there is something about having been indoors for so long plus how much effort we put into trying to get this trip back on which has got to us. We too had almost lost hope of going on our Iceland trip not that long ago.We write a small travel blog and will post a trip report on our return. Good luck to everyone else planning to travel soon to Iceland."
"Have a great trip, Una! I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that everything works out perfectly for you."
"@163: Thank you for posting the details of your experience. For me, no vacation is worth that inconvenience, pain, and stress—not to mention all the potential complications. Looks like it will be a domestic vacation for us this summer..."
"Well, things went approximately to plan yesterday. The Icelandair flight LHR to KEF was around a third full. You could use the overhead lockers after take off. KEF almost deserted. No queues at Passport Control or the test booths. The young man who did my nasal swab really pushed it far back. My 4th Covid test and most painful so far. We got our duty free and hire car and headed to Reykjavik. Around 8pm ( 4 hours after test) my husband had his message on the app to say all clear. At 9pm, a nurse phoned me with the news that my Covid swab was positive and I needed to attend the clinic at 10 am the next morning.The clinic was in the grounds of the General Hospital on the city outskirts. The nurse came to the car to bring me in and I had a blood test and another swab.We spent an hour sorting out our hire car ( getting a new car due to a fault ) and shortly afterwards the nurse phoned me to say that my antibodies were positive and I was all clear to enjoy my holiday.My husband went for a haircut, we browsed the shops, we strolled around the harbour and we enjoyed the almost tropical geothermal beach near Perlan.So overall a warm, sunny happy day in Reykjavik.It is good to be here and worth the effort. We will head out West tomorrow for almost two weeks in the West and North.Good luck to all other travellers arriving soon."
"Thank you for the feedback. Have a great, well deserved holiday now!"
Good to hear all went well and you can enjoy your holidays!
"Thanks for the update! So if I understand the terminology, you have already had Covid and your husband hasn't? Don't let him know that you have SuperPowers and can go out for everything!"
"I think she said earlier they both already had it, so were confident they would have antibodies if testing positive."
"so if you already had covid (even say, several weeks/months ago), you will automatically test positive with this PCR / swab test or not necessarily, I'm not sure I understand?"
"Hi Everybody,I have my trip planned for Mid-August 4 nights , flights from UK. At the moment, I am not willing to take the risk of a COVID 19 test at the airport as the chances of a 2 weeks quarantine is big. Do you think the test at the airport might be scrapped by Mid-August?Thanks.Edited: 5:22 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"@UnaW - I dont expect to travel this year (my choice, too wary) but I am so envious of you right now! I bet your trip will be amazing with so few tourists about. The test being painful isn't great through, I've read a few comments about that.There appears to be a potential situation developing with testing, with the current testers wanting to drop out and hand off to the University Hospital who say they dont have the resources to pickp immediately - I wonder if this could increase the risk of delays in getting results. https:/… @CristiM - As the University Hospital is planning on installing kit that can do 4000 tests a day by late August it seems very unlikely testing will cease in the foreseeable."
UnaW -thank you for reporting & Have a wonderful holiday!Please do post when you have some downtime on the car problem - I hope you didn't have to go back to the airport to switch cars?!
"@Anton S.: some people still have virus present during a pcr test even after they have had the disease. That's why it sounds like everyone who is tested positive with a pcr test in Iceland then gets an antibody test. If you test positive for antibodies you don't have to go into isolation, because it means you are no longer a risk to others."
Thanks Kim T.!I personally am not very fond of the idea of having to go through the ordeal of blood taking on a trip to Iceland in addition to the swab test and instead of going on a day tour which is the only reason I would want to go to Iceland in the first place ;-(I don't think they will stop the testing this Summer. I read somewhere they plan on keeping the testing at minimum til end of year (December).I am going to look for another country to travel to and which would not have such testing procedures.
"Personally I am willing to go through testing for the peace of mind that I can then continue with my plans without needing to worry about unwillingly infecting others, but I am sure there are other options out there.The risk of being tested positive and/or falling ill while travelling is simply the risk inherent in travelling these days, I guess.I commend Iceland for doing this to enable visitors to travel while at the same time trying to keep their citizens safe."
"As Kim says, people who have fully recovered from Covid 19 may still have a positive swab test even months later. This is because tiny fragments of virus and dead cells may be present and the test amplified their signal. It is fairly random whether or not a recovered patient will still test positive or not. But the majority of recovered patients will have antibodies and this is worth verifying in advance for anyone coming to Iceland who knows that they have previously had COVID-19. Some unlucky people may not make antibodies and this will be a problem for them in terms of demonstrating a marker of immunity. They are better off choosing a different travel destination.Curiosa, our car from Ice Rental Car had a defective fuel pump and a warning light came on. Luckily a branch in the city near the hospital exchanged the vehicle so we did not need to return to the airport. We were glad of our extra days in Reykjavik to troubleshoot this before we headed out west and north."
Thanks for sharing this info! :-)
"Here's an update on testing:https:/…The background is that deCode genetics had been doing most of the airport testing and they announced rather suddenly that they would stop participating as of July 13th. The good news is that it looks as though the University Hospital will be able to pick up the slack. In the short term they will do batch testing. (That involves initially testing ten samples at once and only testing individual samples if a batched set shows up as positive.) That is a known approach that works well if the detection rate is low, as has been happening at the airport.So it looks as though passenger testing will be able to continue roughly as usual..."
"Depending on how fast they get the batch testing done, though, it means anyone in a positive group will have to return to the lab for another test and wait up to another 12 hours maybe to get their individual results. Another reason not to hop in a rental car and leave town upon arrival. Given the low positivity rates, that shouldn't happen very often, but something to keep in mind."
"> it means anyone in a positive group will have to return to the labProbably not. The normal procedure would be to take two different samples from the original test swab.So it will take longer to do the testing if your sample ends up in a positive batch, but you shouldn't need to be retested."
I agree with kgh222. As far as I know the only reason to be retested would be to do an antibody test after the original pcr test result is positive.I have planned my first two nights in Reykjavík and hope that will be sufficient.
that's good to know. So they keep the individual swabs in reserve. Very handy.
"Hi all,So now it’s my turn to recount my experience. Landed today from Stockholm and the flight was almost full. Upon landing, the crew asked passengers to disembark very smartly in a coherent manner. I had pre registered and was straightly told to go to the testing counters. It took literally 2 mins for the overall testing process and I was out of the airport within 15 mins. I did not find the testing very painful but I would say it was discomforting.Received the magical message in 4 hours that we are negative!!All in all, it was an amazing experience and I would say the arrangement at KEF was phenomenal. Terrific coordination and I would say Iceland is showing the world how it is done! Off to start the whole circle day after (I kept one day buffer, just in case). I wish everyone all the best but if there’s one place you can travel with surety, I would say it is Iceland!Edited: 5:57 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"Excellent news! I've been following this thread for about a week and it's great to hear of positive experiences. I have bitten the bullet and booked my 19th trip to Iceland on 29th July. If I have to quarantine I'll just work from there instead and travel afterwards (if I don't get ill!). Starting my pre-trip quarantine tomorrow!A friend is about to land from Amsterdam right now and am crossing my fingers that she gets the negative test too, obviously.I still haven't seen any reports on forums of anyone who was properly quarantined. Anyone know anyone?"
Results of testing so fat at KEF:https:/…
"DeletedEdited: 6:11 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Hello everyone, and I'd like to thank you all for your contributions on this very helpful thread. I read all of it a few days ago and have been following ever since.I wanted to ask if the Icelandic authorities have actually said anything definitive on how long they plan to continue testing?We are in the UK and have been very cautious indeed during the UK's bungled lockdown. We are desperate to get a break and having been to Iceland for the first time last year and loved it, are very attracted to the idea of coming to Iceland again. Not only did we know as soon as we arrived last time that we'd definitely be back, but now this year it's one of the only places in the world we can go and feel at least somewhat safe from COVID. Plus, the activities we would want to undertake are mostly safe anyway -driving in our own hire car, hiking etc.Ideally to be honest we'd hop on a plane literally tomorrow! but we have work and other constraints so can likely not come until mid-August. I have seen others imply that they would not travel whilst the testing regime is in place. But for us, we WANT the regime to be in place still and it's one of the reasons we would travel. We know that it means that Iceland, which has handled COVID so well so far, will continue to be a safe place for its citizens and any visitors (well, as far as possible - nothing is certain and there is always some risk). I have read everything about the 2k tests a day limit and the sudden change in who is doing the testing, plus I understand the batch testing is now being undertaken. It seems to me that originally it was quite clear - there was a limit of 2k tests a day. Then suddenly the organisation doing the testing backed out (how does that even happen?!) but the university is doing the testing instead, and the batch testing will help with this. All understood - but none of this says what the capacity is for testing now and what the Icelandic government plans to do about it. We're looking at coming in around 4 weeks and I totally understand that in a pandemic situation, 4 weeks is a long time - so I'm not looking for anyone to be clairvoyant! what I am hoping is that there might have been something said by the government as to their future plans, that hasn't been reported on here yet.I would be grateful for the thoughts of anyone who knows."
"I would expect testing to continue for many more months, as long as the pandemic continues and Iceland is accepting visitors."
I have read somewhere that with the batch testing they expect to ramp up their capacity even further. Will try to find the source later.
"https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/07/10/changes-…This article states that they are considering exempting certain countries from testing in August, but nothing definitive yet."
"Hello Guys,Thank you all for sharing with us your experience. I have a question for you. I have a 4 nights trip to Iceland in about 4 weeks, flying from the UK. My question is what will happen if I will be found positive during the airport screening. Will I have to sort out my accommodation for the two weeks or I will be taken to a hospital ?"
"First they will do an antibody test. If that yields a negative result you will have to go into isolation:https:/…how-does-isolation-workIf someone sitting next to you is tested positive for the virus and negative for antibodies, you will have to quarantine:https:/…how-does-quarantine-work"
"Today's news is that some incoming flights to Keflavik over the next two weeks may have to be cancelled due to testing capacity limits:https:/…Keflavik currently has a capacity of 2000 tests a day. The schedule flights look like they may deliver up to 3000 people per day, so the authorities are looking at canceling some flights over the next two weeks. (Note that this is independent of the transfer of testing from deCode genetics to the University Hospital, which is happening today.)Meetings are happening , but there seem to be no decisions yet. It's possible testing capacity might be increased, or they might stop testing some countries. Or they might really have to do last minute flight cancellations, which would be unfortunate.Edited: 11:48 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Being booked on a flight in 12 days, and after having had to cancel two other trips I truly looked forward to this year, the possibility of having my flight cancelled is quite frightening... Hopefully they will find some kind of solution and nobody will have to miss out on their holiday. By the way, according to ruv.is (and Google translate) the private company will continue to process the Covid tests for another week as the university hospital is not ready yet, but this isn't related to the problem of being able to process only 2000 samples per day."
"Folks, this is the first time I've had the chance to check this thread in 24 hours so only just seen the responses since my last post. The suggestion of stopping testing some countries in August is what I was fearing - but then the possibility of last-minute cancellations to flights because the number of people coming into the country per day exceeds 2,000 is a completely contrary position. What concerns me slightly about it is the volumes are surely predictable, at least within a range, so they must have seen this coming. This seems uncharacteristically inefficient considering the exemplary Icelandic response to date. Ah well, nobody is perfect - we'll just have to wait and see what happens! I'm really hoping they'll find a way to increase testing capacity (the batch tests?) somewhere between the private company and the university.I'm genuinely curious - why has the private company stopped doing the testing - and why now? Has there been any criticism in Icelandic media over it? It seems... surprising to me, that the company would stop relatively abruptly when it's so important. But I'm likely missing something."
"It's hard to know what's really going on, but I can't help thinking there is some degree of brinkmanship involved.The private company (deCode Genetics) had been doing a good job, but they had supposedly stepped in only as a temporary help while other testing was arranged. They seem to have decided that the only way to stop being a ""temporary"" help was to announce they were stepping out, with a hard deadline of July 13th. But in practice they are still helping out this week during the transfer of testing to the University Hospital. (Which is nice of them.)Similarly the tourist authorities and the airlines must have seen that they were going to exceed the 2000 tests per day limit. So now they have created some pressure on the testing authorities to either increase capacity or relax testing for some countries or to take responsibility for cancelling flights. Ho hum.I hope this does all get figured out this week. I'm schedule to fly next Monday and I'd be disappointed to have things fall apart at this stage!"
"BTW, the latest rumor on mbl.is (and remember it is a *rumor*) is that the authorities are about to drop the testing requirement for travelers from Germany, Norway and Denmark. We'll see in a few days if that is true. If so, it would free up enough testing capacity to keep everything running."
"Interesting stuff, thanks KGH222. I just listened to the English podcast from the RUV English Facebook page. Interesting to hear the discussions (on non-COVID topics as well as COVID).I'm getting nervous that by the time we are due to travel (just under 4 weeks' time), tourism numbers will be almost back to normal, testing will no longer be happening and Iceland will be heading for a worsening COVID situation.I really hope not...But my suspicion is that if you are travelling soon, you will be fine - this testing capacity crisis has the ring of something that will be resolved in the short term at least by the authorities and private company cooperating a little longer - but if that's just to span the gap until they can exempt certain countries from testing, well that's something that bothers me. I just can't see how the better answer isn't to find a way to ramp up testing further. After all, the cost of it doesn't seem to be putting off the tourists.. I'm really quite surprised the cost was reduced. I feel that if the cost it's being charged at is subsidised, it may not need to be. Iceland is an expensive destination to travel to in normal times and I'd have thought there would be enough tourists prepared to pay a higher charge for the test that they could find a way to cost-justify increasing the capacity.But i'm well aware that these things often look simpler from the outside than the reality."
"I suppose Iceland has had time to evaluate the risk of not testing certain countries - my hunch is that there has been none or very, very few testing positive on arrivals from some countries with currently very low spread. And by mid August the summer holidays in the Nordic countries have ended and I am reasonably sure flight numbers will be reduced. Icelandic summer holidays will also be over, many now holidaying in their own country this year. Surely, Iceland would want to allow more flights from other countries in Europe up to their testing capacity.And there will be no tourists from the US or the far east in the foreseeable future and I believe these make up for a big chunk of the total number of tourists. I have not looked at the actual statistics though. And no cruise ships mean no coach loads for the popular spots close to Reykjavik. Feel sorry for the shop owners though. Main shopping street in central Reykjavik is geared towards the tourist business, and they are completely dead."
"I've been following today's press conference on visir.is. It is now official that they will stop screening passengers from Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany from July 16th already. This applies to anyone who has spent at least the previous 14 days in these countries, not dependent on nationality/passport. They seem to consider accepting Covid certificates from abroad in the future as well."
"(edit, sorry, wrong forum :) )Edited: 11:27 am, July 14, 2020 "
"I am so incredibly lucky: it looks like the government has decided to exempt four more countries from mandatory testing starting tomorrow, which is 24 hours before my arrival, and Germany is on the list. I was confused when there was no option to prepay on my registration form, but it seems that's the reason why..."
That's great! Enjoy your trip :-)
"yes, lucky you!!!so far trip cancelled for us :-(so where can we find the list of the countries newly exempt from testing?"
"I was trying to find an English version of the article about yesterday's press conference, but still available only in Icelandic. However, an official page linked from covid.is has the list of new countries (near the bottom): https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/greinar/grein/item39194/Skilgreind-svaedi-med-smitahaettu---Defined-areas-with-risk-of-infection-(27-02-2020)They were mentioning yesterday that the Baltic countries, France and Spain would be the next to be exempted from testing, but the infection numbers are not there yet."
"Previously exempt were Greenland and the Faroe Islands.Newly added were Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany:https:/…"
"Thank you guys for the info, I will be crossing fingers and checking the situation ...Have a great trip! :-)"
Woohoo Kim! Looking forward to your trip report!
Hopefully Holland is next!
I hope Italy will be next!! :)
Thank you! I'll let you know how it goes. This time it'll be mainly the Westfjords and a 3-day hike around Kerlingarfjöll if everything works out.
Very interesting threadI am booked to visit in mid October for a weekend. Hopefully things will have calmed down a little more by then as really want to enjoy a break away. I will keep checking on the situation.
"Arrival last night for me went very smoothly. We deboarded row by row and kept our masks on in the terminal.At a checkpoint we had to show our registration barcodes for scanning as well as our passports. The staff at the checkpoint questioned everyone as to our point of origin and in which countries we had been for the last two weeks.Having been in Germany during that time I was able to proceed to pick up my luggage. The couple from Austria next to me were sent for testing.Everyone kept their masks on on the Flybus.Edited: 10:25 am, July 18, 2020 "
"Sound swell organized, Kim. Enjoy your trip!"
"The transition of COVID-19 border testing from deCode genetics to the University Hospital is now complete and everything seems to be running smoothly.I was tested at Keflavik yesterday (July 20th) at 6:40am and the result came through at 14:45. BTW, for what it's worth, I found the deep nasal swab only a mild nuisance, for only a couple of seconds. I know different people react differently, but I wouldn't treat this as a major issue in planning your trip."
So you are tested upon arrival - and then have to go straight to your hotel until the result comes through? Is that correct?We are only going to be there for 3 days - our flight arrives at 3.00pm. If we have to isolate in the hotel until we get a test result it may mean missing out on going out for dinner and drinks in the evening in Reykjavik. We are a group of three travelling so would need to ensure that all of us have had our results. Maybe by October this won't still be in place.
"You don't have to totally isolate yourself, but in order not to put others at risk I would recommend getting dinner to go instead of eating out, just to minimize interaction until your results are back."
"#224 << Maybe by October this won't still be in place. >>That’s correct, maybe it won’t be in place...then again, maybe it will be! No one has any way of knowing at this point in time :)If you still require testing on arrival, I would personally minimize all interaction as much as possible with individuals outside of my travel group, until all test results were known; this should be on the day you arrive but could in fact be the next day, especially if your flight is delayed.From the FAQ page on the Covid.is website, https://www.covid.is/faqQ: How long does it take to be tested?“ The wait time for those tested in Keflavik airport is around one hour but may be slightly longer during peak hours. This may vary in other airports and ports where travellers will be tested at local healthcare centres. Once a swab has been collected, passengers can continue on to their registered address (listed in their pre-registration form). Passengers do not need to self-quarantine until they receive their test results, but should take preventive measures to protect themselves and others from infection.Passengers can expect to receive their test results within 24 hours, usually on the same day, or the following day for those arriving later than 5 PM. Passengers will receive their test results through the app (Rakning C-19), or through text message. Passengers who test positive will receive a phone call notifying them. To ensure they receive their test results, all passengers are required to provide reliable contact information on their pre-registration forms.”"
"Hey Kim T.I’m glad you were able to get to Iceland as planned, and I hope you have an awesome trip!Be safe and stay well."
"After being tested at Kefklavik I was given a leaflet. This said that test results should be available ""within 12 hours arriving at Keflavik airport"".It also said ""please be careful until you receive your test result"" and "" Stay at home or your registered location and avoid close contact with other people.""So I think going out to dine at a restaurant before test results arrived would be be a bit of a no-no.The Icelandic authorities are being really nice by allowing tourists into Iceland right now, when so many other countries are still closed. It isn't unreasonable for them to ask for some amount of self isolation until the test results arrive."
"Quick update on this - although there was an announcement that people would no longer actually be notified if their test result was negative, well I just got one, six hours after my test on arrival, so they're clearly still doing it! Really smooth journey on Icelandair from LHR T2 today - couldn't have gone better. And now I've had my negative result I'm free to enjoy the place - yay!! Oh, and the thing up the nose - really not that bad, if a little eye-watering and strange."
"Thanks so much for updating on this. I'm really bothered by the idea that I can have a test but not actually receive confirmation either way. I assumed when it was first announced that they would still, by default, send a result - but just that as a 'backstop', given the problems they'd had with delivery to some foreign phones, people were to assume that they were negative if they hadn't been 'stalked down' by the authorities within 24 hours. However then I read that they literally didn't plan to release test results, which really bothered me. Apart from anything else it feels a bit unethical to not even try and give the subject the results of a clinical test.Anyway - glad to hear it's as I originally assumed.I'm continuing to watch the results with keen interest since we're supposed to be flying from the UK to Iceland on 9th August... only 2 weeks away but that's a lifetime in the pandemic! Have a great trip."
"""I'm really bothered by the idea that I can have a test but not actually receive confirmation either way""- I can fully relate to that.Just a small sidenote:- The ""we might not message you"" policy isn't out of spite for people's first 24 hour holiday time. The messages to those who test negative may not be terminated as of yet. The changes are to enable the swab staff at The Directorate of Health to:# Focus on the samples that do test positive for Covid-19 and to make immediate contact with those who need to come in for an antibodies test.## Not get 150 phone calls every day with the same ""Are my results in?"" question. These calls were occupying a lot of their time. People weren't always getting their text messages due to various reasons (technical errors with their phone/subscription, mismatching data roaming contracts, wrong number/country code entered somewhere, phones still in airplane mode, etc. etc.).The main difference is a policy shift from a ""you must hear from us before continuing"" policy into a ""if you don't hear from us within a certain time frame, you're clear by default"" policy."
"Hi, thanks for this and yes, I understood the reasoning behind it which is why I alluded to some of those items in my last post. For me, there is a very significant difference though between 'we're not going to contact you' and 'we are going to contact you but we're going to prioritise the positive tests'. Of course I can't read Icelandic so I have had to go by the few English sources I've been able to glean, and they were implying a 'we will only contact positive cases' approach, so I was genuinely happy to read that this isn't that.On a related note - I see there is a sudden jump in 6 positive cases by local transmission in Iceland today - is anyone able to provide information about this?"
@Jules / 232 there is an updated article here re current infections;https:/… @Kim / 221 - did passengers voluntarily wear masks on the Flybus or was it mandatory?
"Thanks for that - and that's an interesting 'hole' they found in the process. Good that they found it, though and no doubt they will 'plug' it with form and/or procedure changes.I know I will be continuing to watch all of this with very keen interest. It's not only that I am so keen for things to stay stable and in control so that we may proceed with our visit on 9th August. But more generally, I am so keen for Iceland to see it stay on top of all of this whilst still opening up somewhat. Iceland is an example to much of the world in how it has handled this so far. It is inevitable that there will be some 'learn as we go' (as with the refinement on the process for Icelandic people returning, and this latest 'hole' in the process identified as a result of these new cases). But hopefully Iceland can keep on top of it despite these things and just keep refining and 'winning' (as far as anything can be 'won' in this pandemic)."
"I'm not sure if it was mandatory, but everyone on the Flybus was wearing a mask. It just makes sense..."
"Agree it makes sense, but not all travellers pack sense unfortunately."
"Thank you Jules in Swindon! It certainly made me feel a lot better having the result! And obviously nice to get a negative result in a pandemic (even though I was very confident, as I've been quarantining myself for most of the past 4.5 months, and definitely the past two weeks). I suggest doing the same - make sure you don't take any risks before going, and try to book seats on the plane in advance where it's unlikely someone will sit next to you! But looking at the Spain situation, who knows what will happen in the next couple of weeks. Iceland, hopefully, will still be fine, and hopefully the UK too..."
"Hi, Satkinson1 - we live in the middle of nowhere so have taken almost no risks in the last months. Through my work, I 'smelled the coffee' earlier than most, and we locked down ourselves and our families a week before the UK's actual lockdown (which was still too late...) Whilst having done a lot of outdoor exercise (see: we live in the middle of nowhere), we didn't drive or leave the village other than on foot or on a bike for months, and even in recent weeks have only been to a store a maximum once a week, wearing a mask, and in the quiet hour before closing. We have more recently been meeting up with friends but only outside e.g. for long walks. In short, there are very few people lower risk than us. We also both had negative COVID tests a couple of weeks ago - we've been using the Zoe app and having lodged a couple of (hayfever - I wasn't worried at all) sore throats, were invited to take tests. We're lucky to still have jobs (for now) and be working from home. We'll continue to be as cautious before we come so I'd be stunned if we had positive tests on arrival.All of this is the reason we've rebooked to come to Iceland again after our first visit last year. We definitely wanted to come back, and anyway right now we'd travel anywhere in the world to get away if the country is 'safe'! Our last trip was about 90% socially distanced given we were driving in our own hire car and hiking/ sightseeing, so we knew this was the perfect time to come again to Iceland. So I'm just sincerely hoping - but as I say, not just for something as trivial as our trip, but for the example it sets the world - Iceland continues its success."
"Our family of 4 arrived this morning from Luton. Because we had children with us (exempt from testing) we were sent to a separate family queue for testing, so basically waited only a few minutes. The normal queue was quite long. My husband found the nose swab the worst, particularly when they sort of twist it round once it reaches the back. I actually found that part ok, but gagged during the throat swab. The tester had to try again and I gagged again, but he checked the swab and said he had enough for the sample. Very unpleasant, and made my eyes water, but forgotten about within a minute. Certainly no sore throat or headache afterwards like I’ve seen some people mention. And worth the discomfort to be able to enjoy Iceland."
"@CaramelCruffin, thanks for posting your recent experiences. I am also hoping to travel from the UK, with my husband, next Sunday. Can I ask, have they explained to you how it works with the new restrictions? How long will you be in Iceland? We will be there for 7 days and my understanding is that we simply have the test on arrival, that you have had, and once clear of that we can proceed with our trip (though we will be completely socially distancing and taking as few risks as possible anyway). I don't think any of the extra restrictions apply to us since we will be gone in less than 10 days - no second test on day 5 for us. Is this your understanding and did you get any information to confirm this?Fingers crossed you get the all-clear for all the family and that you have a great trip."
CaramelCruffin - did you have to keep to yourselves in your hotel for 24 hours ? Hope you enjoy the trip. I am looking forward to mine in October - if all goes to plan.
"We are here for 12 days. One of us got a text at about 8pm last night, and one about 10am this morning, both negative. We asked how the second test works and were told we will be sent information in a few days about it. I don’t know how they know who is staying for the 10 or more days to qualify for a second test but we’ll find out soon I guess. You don’t have to isolate in your hotel, they just ask that for the first 24 hours (or until your negative result comes through) you keep a distance from people as much as possible. You’re allowed to go out and about, but we got food to takeaway rather than sitting inside restaurants. We did all the tourist sights in Reykjavik which are mostly outdoors anyway."
CaramelCruffin: How did the second test go? And how were you informed when to go?
I am glad it all worked out efficiently and that you are free to enjoy your vacation.Thanks for reporting back in such detail.I hope you have a great time in Iceland!
"Wow! It was informative. Thank you so much! We are (hopefully) going early morning on Friday so your detailed post helped a lot.Also, thank all the other bloggers."
https://www.ruv.is/frett/2020/08/10/liklega-…Google Translate is a bit funny but does this say they might drop the 2nd test requirement for long term visitors?
Excellent update - thank you JulesinSwindon Hope you are having a good trip.
"@mcbgl This covid update about Culture Night being canceled mentions the possibility of the secondtest being canceled, but only for Icelanders - doesn't mention tourists. But if they have canceled Culture Night, things are not looking good.https:/…Edited: 11:44 am, August 11, 2020 "
"The wait is a killer btw. Arrived with a same British airways flight today 9:30, and I have a bus at 7 next morning. Still haven’t heard anything, it’s 7 pm now.I don’t know if I will travel after this to any country for “travelling” purpose. As safe as Iceland is this process is very stressful, whether you undergo a test or not. The amount of people interaction that you do which you have avoided for so long during the lockdown is mind numbing."
Didn't they tell you you can consider yourself negative if you haven't heard back after 24 hours? Apparently they prioritize contacting the people with positive test results.
