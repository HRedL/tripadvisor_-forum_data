"The Secrets Akumal resort has reportedly let all 400 employees go without any payment of money due to them, including the tip money for many. In my opinion, unless the resort can prove otherwise or pay the money due, they deserve any bad publicity they get. Unfortunately, this is a US owned resort, operated by AM Resorts, doing this to the already underpaid resorts. Since they operate many resorts in the area, I would not be surprised if others follow this pattern.https:/…"
"Please keep providing updates like this. Most of the big resorts are owned by companies outside of Mexico and I suspect the will be doing the same as Secrets and other AM resorts. This will help me decide where I stay on my next trip to Mexico.Edited: 10:00 am, March 27, 2020 "
I'm surprised more resorts haven't closed by now.
"Same report in Riviera Maya News (in English)...https:/…2020.htmlMore than 450 workers let go from Akumal hotelBy Riviera Maya News on March 27, 2020Akumal, Q.R. — Dozens of hotel workers expressed their annoyance Thursday after approximately 460 were let go from Secrets Akumal Riviera Maya earlier in the week.The group demonstrated outside the hotel citing unjustified dismissals and asking to keep their jobs with minimum wage pay. Accompanied by their union delegate, the workers demand that during the period of inactivity they be paid a minimum wage as the law indicates.“Colleagues work and train, but they are not valued. We have been waiting three days from morning to afternoon looking for an answer. Today the hotel closes, but they wash their hands, they say they are leaving until further notice,” said Petronila Rodríguez Cruz, CROC delegate for this hotel.The group said they would stay until a hotel manager agreed to meet, which eventually did happen. There was no word on the outcome of the meeting."
I agree with Marcus - I won’t patronize an establishment that treats people like this!
I cannot believe the heartlessness of this. I will remember which resorts treated their employees with generosity or not when it's time to return. And I have been to Secrets Akumal 2xs.
It is hoped that many will remember the attitude the resort take toward the employees at this time. Hopefully most will not be as heartless as this Secrets resort.
Why don’t you post this on Cancun forum also-?- let more readers see this treatment of humanity :-/
"Good idea, Zeeka. I will do that. Likely since this resort chain has many locations, this will not be the only time they will do this."
Disgraceful but not surprised. I was at the resort 2 years ago and the staff were brilliant. I'm really feeling bad for the workers just now as a lot will lose their jobs. Hopefully things can get back to normal again in a few months.
"I understand businesses need to make difficult decisions in these difficult times, but to lock out your employees without communicating with them is deplorable. These resort management companies have raked in the profits during years of record occupancy and to leave their employees literally out on the street is something that needs to be made public knowledge. I will be watching and will make my future purchasing decisions based on what I see from these resorts in the coming days/weeks. Right now, AM Resorts has been moved to my ""not interested in ever supporting"" list."
"Have to say my opinion of that resort chain was already low but this just moved it to the bottom. My best friend worked at one of the resorts and developed a very serious illness. She was afraid to take sick time because told me they would fire her. They only relented a bit when I told her supervisor I would make the story well-known on TA.Edited: 4:52 pm, March 27, 2020 "
Where is the Mexican government in this? Shouldn't they be enforcing rules?
I would not hold my breath to see the Mexican Government enforce anything. Unless it benefits some at the top.

"Some good news. At least a partial win for employees. This translated from todays Novedades newspaper.""Yesterday, Uri Carmona revealed the agreements that were reached, among which he highlights that pregnant workers will receive their full salary, as well as older adults and unionized staff with plant contracts will be able to use vacations until the end of the contingencyWorkers with less than 90 days of seniority are applied low income until the contingency ends , in addition they will be given consistent support in 1,500 pesos in grocery vouchers only during the month of April 2020. Workers with more 90 days old will receive minimum wage payment, and grocery vouchers during the months of April and May 2020, ""said the union representative.""As far as the minimum wage, it should be mentioned it is currently about 100 pesos a day.According to a friend of a friend who works at the resort, Secrets did not expect all the bad publicity they received. According to him, that and then the Governors threat to apply sanctions for such actions, caused Secrets to decide to negotiate with the workers union."
"Thanks for the update Robert. The fact remains they still tried to do this so they shall remain on my no-go list.Edited: 9:44 am, March 28, 2020 "
"Thank you Robert for bringing this up. I first read it on the Cancun forum but noticed today that it was no longer on that forum. I agree whole heartedly with #10! I read an interesting quote today from Mark Cuban ( Dallas Mavericks coach, and not always one we would turn to for calm reasoning) ""How companies respond... is going to define their brand for decades""."
Did I read that right? 100 pesos for a full day of work? That's like four dollars!
"Unfortunately , you read that correctly. Actually , the wage works out to about 123 pesos per day. How you would you like to feed a family on that? I agree with GoodtoGo. The fact is AM resorts tried to do this and had workers not received public and media attention, they will still be doing it. Really doubt the government would have ever intervened."
""" Where is the Mexican government in this? Shouldn't they be enforcing rules?""As I've indicated a few threads on here, Mexico's ""rule of law"" rating is spectacularly low. Not even in the top 100 in the world. In the Americas, only Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Honduras are lower."
"I Knew they was on poor wages, but if that's all they earn where the hell do they do their shopping"
"""where the hell do they do their shopping"" Not at the supermarkets, that is for sure. I often see tourists say the supermarkets here are not so bad and they are similar to US prices. True. But imagine what a local on minimum wage can buy there.The only way most live is that few live alone. For example my friends in Cozumel have 7 living together, 6 of them working."
Wages = xTips = many times x
Missing during all of this: Many times X.
"Most workers here (resort or otherwise) do indeed live on these wages and it is a shock to most visitors from the US and CAD. Resort employees and other low paid workers we know personally do shop at the smaller neighborhood store, but also at the more local Chedrauis and Sorianos for many items they need. .Happy AMR agreed to provide these benefits, similar to other large resorts in the area. All we can hope for is a speedy recovery for the tourism industry for these workers who rely solely on that for income. Many workers we know have retreated to their hometowns to find other ways to survive during this ordeal."
"The help with groceries will help in the short term and hopefully things get back to normal before long. The workers "" will be given consistent support in 1,500 pesos in grocery vouchers only during the month of April 2020. Workers with more 90 days old will receive minimum wage payment, and grocery vouchers during the months of April and May 2020, ""said the union representative."" So , in terms of the dollar about 65 dollars a month.Of course, these workers are better off than some of my Cozumel friends. They are more or less self employed so with no tourists, no income."
"Was considering booking a Secrets resort this November, since I have enjoyed them in the past, but will be looking at a different resort now. I know the answer to this, but, how can you treat your employees like this and expect them to give great service for future tourists to come? I know when you need a job, you will take what you have to, but, I bet they consider where they put in their applications next time. Not good PR."
"I know many young Mexicans and am amazed at the treatment they tolerate from these resorts. Most really just seem to put in their time and ignore the treatment. My best friend worked at one of these resorts for years and thought she had no choice. But she was fortunate to get a job with a non travel American company with offices in Merida.Now she is the envy of her friends. A 5 day work week with weekends off, 8 hour days. paid holidays for both Mexican and US , good non government health insurance. Now working from home during the Corona crisis.So some do have a chance to escape the treatment of the resorts."
"Education is key, and the reality is most here will just never have that opportunity and feel lucky to be working at all. In fact many working in the RM are from other areas and are here in Q Roo either on approved work visas or are illegals. It seems the majority of management personnel are from Mexico City and other areas."
"There are multiple Secrets resorts in RM. For that matter, there are many AMResorts in RM: Dreams, Now, Zoetry, et al.Just curious: Was this specific to that single resort? Or did other Secrets attempt the same? Did other AMResorts attempt the same?"
The various Secrets and other AMResorts Facebook pages (as well as all off the other major resort Facebook pages) are busy...AMR has been issuing closure updates for all of their properties...
"From what I have heard, this was only an action taken by the GM at the Akumal location. AM Resorts may not be too pleased with him after all the negative publicity he has generated for the chain."
">> From what I have heard, this was only an action taken by the GM at the Akumal location. AM Resorts may not be too pleased with him after all the negative publicity he has generated for the chain. <<CEO & presidente Alejandro Zozaya-Gorostiza had better make a statement to that effect soon..."
"Bluewater, I agree. If those at the top of the AM organization do not approve of this action taken in Akumal, they need to be saying so. A lack of comment by them is telling."
"For those considering not booking at Secrets when you were originally planning to stay there, please remember that you really only hurt the employees. Many people will still book at this resort, but, not all understand how little the employees earn, and since most places in the Riviera Maya are all inclusive resorts, the guests often feel tipping is not needed, so they don't or just very little. I've seen it happen a lot, and it's so sad to know how hard the staff work for so little pay. If you were planning to stay at Secrets Akumal, you should continue your plans, and remember while you are there to tip fairly, and if possible, generously. Treat the staff with respect and kindness. Remember that they depend on any job they can get, and if protesting a resort by trying to hit them in their wallets is the goal, and it actually works, Secrets will just move on to another location, and all those over 400 employees will be out of work."
Ant new info on this??Happy Travels!
