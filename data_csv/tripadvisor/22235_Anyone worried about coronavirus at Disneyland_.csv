"We have plans to visit Disneyland in late March. We have cancellable hotel reservations, tickets that are good thru Jan 2021, and we are traveling by car. So not the end of the world to cancel, although our kids would be devastated. This would be their first time there.I’m wondering if anyone else is starting to worry about going to Disneyland. The news of the spread of COVID19 is getting worse by the hour, literally. I’m worried what the status will be in 3 weeks. I recall the Disneyland measles outbreak a few years back. Seems like a place you’d want to avoid in a pandemic."
There’s already a pandemic going on with another virus; influenza. Does that one worry you?Your choice.
"Same, we’re supposed to leave this Saturday. Flexible reservations. I’m on the fence. Then again, there are no cases right now, that we know of. Hopefully people that are sick stay home. I think we’ll go and just hand sanitize like crazy."
"""There’s already a pandemic going on with another virus; influenza. Does that one worry you?""Seasonal flu does not meet the requirements for a pandemic."
"Don't let the 24/7 news cycles freak you out. Millions of Californians are going about their lives as usual, with, perhaps, taking extra precautions like washing their hands more often, using hand sanitizers, etc. Bring disinfecting wipes and wipe down bars on the rides you take, etc. Using common sense practices can help keep you safe and help prevent spreading more germs, whether they be flu, colds, etc."
"Approx. death rate for COVID19: 2%Flu: 0.1%Yes, I’m more worried about the disease with a 20x higher death rate. With no vaccine yet.(I’m in California, I am going about my life as usual, but my daily life is not spent inside an amusement park with millions of visitors from around the world.)"
"Understood.A lot to consider. As a parent, you have to weigh whether your visit is worth the risk, which at this point is very minimal, but who knows what things will be like a few weeks from now.Disneyland will still be there if you decide to postpone your plans."
"I think if there were a real risk, they'd close the parks, as they have for Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong Disneyland."
"No, no worries. I don;'t understand why you would ask if anyone else (strangers) is worried? Point is, are YOU worried?"
"Cancel if you are worried. The measles cluster was limited and measles is airborne whereas coronavirus is not. I am in healthcare and I am not more worried at this point than usual and go about my life as usual. I would be there over spring break too if we didn't spend Christmas there and a week in January at WDW. (Going to Yosemite instead so my toddler gets exposed to some more nature).Take usual precautions and teach the kids not to touch their eyes/mouth/nose with their hands.Edited: 10:14 pm, March 02, 2020 "

"Mildly concerned? Yes. Worried? Not really. I feel like Disney is probably doing a lot of cleaning behind the scenes. I asked two doctors about precautions we should take for Disney. Handwashing was number one, like everybody says. Drilling the kids about it every day. If people want to cancel over spring break to thin out the crowds, I won't stop them..."
"It also has tourists from all over the world. Personally, I would watch how things progress over the next few weeks. As another poster said, Disneyland will be there."
"No, no worries. Haven't thought about it at all."
"Weigh your own level of comfort; if it were me, I would probably put off the trip to another year, as there are so many uncertainties. I remember tales told by my mother about polio scares that closed public pools and parks during summers of her childhood. Last of these summer epidemics of polio in LA was 1954, during my childhood."
"Just don't touch your face, cough or sneeze into your elbow if you need to, and wash your hands like you just cut up some chile peppers and you need to take your contacts out. :)"
"""Not really. I feel like Disney is probably doing a lot of cleaning behind the scenes.""If they were doing it, you'd hear about it.Edited: 1:52 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Why would we hear about cleaning? Disney doesn't talk about maintenance issues and cleaning and being scared of guests catching anything. That's mundane stuff that isn't part of the ""magic."" The public message is that Disneyland is a wonderful happy place."
"^^^^ I can tell you don't live in SoCal. You can find many articles, both print and local TV, over the years that talk about, and show, their cleaning methods. Search ""Disneyland cleaning."""

My fear would be getting half way along the drive and having them close the park
Individual choice. Cherish that as you wash your hands.And get a flu shot if you have not already done so.
they might just close it very very shortly like all of the other disneys
Bob Chapek has a very big decision to make.....

"Yes, we're a little bit concerned. We're supposed to head out there in a week and we're considering postponing. We'd have to pay $600 to change flights that cost $750 originally. Ugh. Everything else we can change with no fee. Our kid wipes his face A LOT. It's a nervous habit. And, I just finished treatment for cancer 2 weeks ago, so I'm a little concerned about my immune system not being strong enough. I see my doctor tomorrow for an official opinion. I would still really love to go and celebrate, but then again, if we postpone we'd go in October and I love Halloween, so I'd be happy either way."
"""They might just close it very very shortly like all of the other disneys""First, do not assume and post this if you do not know. Secondly, you are using the word ALL and that by no means applies! All Disney Resorts and Parks are not closed.Edited: 3:23 am, March 07, 2020 "

"Planes are germ ponds. People can be showing no symptoms but still have the virus. And breathing recirculated air for 5+ hours? Even if no one on that flight is infected (and you won't know that), you have no idea who was sitting in your seat on the last flight, or the flight before that ... etc."
"Yes we have also put our trip on the hold as we are worried about Coronavirus , we were planning to go during spring break , but due to outbreak since last week we didn’t book the tickets yet , as people might not test positive until 2 weeks and until then it can spread it so many , I have smallKids and it’s hard for them to remember not to touch their face all the time , so I am quite bummed that we are not going as of now but I feel it’s better to be safe than sorry , if things improves in 2 weeks then we will see else will mostly likely go in summer .Thanks ,Ash"
Hopefully lots of people stay away out of fear. Then maybe I can score a boarding pass for ROTR.
"From the CDC website:""This page includes information about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for travelers and travel related industries.""https:/…index.htmlThere is no place in the USA that the CDC warns against traveling."
The reason to get a flu shot is to protect against the flu....which is still a major ailment. It also serves to help eliminate the flu as the likely cause of a viral problem. That is why the CDC recommends a flu shot. And the strong dose for seniors.....Can’t help it if tremendous number of doubters out there.
"Info from CDC on the flu shot:https:/…rr6803a1.htmI’m not saying the flu shot is directed against coronavirus. But it is directed against the flu which does kill people. And the aged are more vulnerable, which is why the CDC recommends the stronger dose for folks like me who are 65 and older.BTW so does my health insurer ....one of the giants....and every other major health insurer. Which is why mine is free."

"The situation will get worse before it gets better. The lack of testing has created great uncertainty. Hopefully, in the next couple weeks, the increased level of testing will better identify the scope of the spread and inform what events need to be shut down. You should be flexible in your plans if you can. Even if you are willing to travel, the decision may get made for you."
"I have until March 17th to cancel the hotel. Broke it to my kids today that we might have to cancel the trip.It’s about a 6 hour drive for us so it’s not the end of the world if Disneyland closed when we’re halfway there, but worse would be we would lose the money we spent on the hotel because by then it would be too late to cancel the hotel.I hope if Disneyland closes long term that they issue refunds for tickets or allow them to be used for longer. We bought ours from target.com so we could get 5% off with the red card.And yeah California is not exactly happy go lucky right now. Our governor just declared an emergency statewide, a cruise ship is stuck off the coast of San Francisco, etc. No known cases in my county yet but in one adjacent county plus one county away there are. Local stores are out of hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, etc. (yes I know you can sort of make your own sanitizer. I was able to buy two bottles of ethanol rubbing alcohol) I just traveled for work, with my flight back being nine days ago. Hopefully I can make another five days without symptoms and then I’ll know that I didn’t somehow contract it on my trip. I wasn’t sitting directly next to anybody on the flights because the planes were not completely full so that’s good. Plus nobody was coughing either at the conference (So Cal) or on the plane.Edited: 1:47 am, March 05, 2020 "
And yes we all got our flu shots like we do every year. But as we all know they’re not 100% effective so having gotten the flu shot doesn’t “rule out” someone having the flu. I’m sure health care providers will still check (nose swab) since it’s pretty easy and fast to do.
The corona virus is not the flu.
Are you worried about the flu? It's less common than the flu so...….

"Hi Scheepmom! I also have until March 17th to cancel our hotel in DL. We are continuing on to an overseas flight so have to go through lax regardless. I change my mind every 30 minutes about whether to cancel. If it were today, I would go. If we see a cluster in LA or Anaheim form like they have in Seattle, which is certainly possible in the next few weeks, then we will just carry on to Australia. Luckily the layover in DL was a surprise for the kids, but I was so proud of myself for keeping that secret! Gah!No real advice but I definitely commiserate. Hope we both get to go but more importantly, that everyone stays healthy.Edited: 12:16 pm, March 05, 2020 "

"Re: post #48 - the reason people are speculating about Disneyland closing is because the Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo parks have all closed until at least mid March. Disneyland Paris is still open, but the Covid 19 outbreak in France is spreading and the French government may force them to close in the coming days as well (other tourist spots like the Louvre have already closed). Now that there are clusters of cases in the US, including several deaths in WA and one just the other day in CA (cruise ship passenger I believe), it is not out of the question that government officials will start taking more drastic containment measures in the US, including closing large gathering places like theme parks. That’s not to say the OP should cancel, the actual risk for healthy people is still pretty minimal. I’m just saying it’s not impossible that the park will close because of this."
"Hi,I am planning on visiting Disneyland Park in mid-May and I was going to purchase tickets this week so I can give them to my girlfriend for her birthday next week.I am a little concerned about the trip in general as we are travelling from the UK and not sure how much worse California will get.Does anyone know if Disney would refund the tickets if cancelled due to the outbreak? I was going to book on a credit card so hoping they'll be covered by the bank anyway. Thanks"
"Mmm no thanks, I don’t take health and safety advice from youtubers..."
"""There is absolutely no chance of Disneyland Resort closing!""This is quite a bold statement, especially with other Disney resorts closing. I'm just not sure how you can state this as a fact. The future's not here yet.Edited: 5:59 pm, March 05, 2020 "
I will be calling Disneyland Resort to check on this right after I eat lunch and posting back.
I’m glad we went a couple of months as I would be hesitant to be booking a trip now. At the moment everything is fine but no one knows what the future will hold in regards to closures etc. I don’t think we’ve seen the worst of it yet.
"For the record, no one is saying that there are rumours that Disneyland WILL close, we are simply saying that, given what’s happening with the other parks, it’s possible that they COULD if the situation in California gets worse. Things are fine now, of course. But things were fine in Paris a few weeks ago, now not so much."
"I am worried. My daughter has a school band trip coming up. It’s already paid for. I’m waiting until closer to the trip date to decide, but I may not let her go. I’m sure she will never talk to me again if she has to sit it out. I do worry about the flu and take some extreme precautions with that as well. She has an immune system deficiency so she can’t fight things off like most people."
"Hi there,This post has been most helpful and interesting to read as we have a trip booked to DLR in 4 weeks time and coming from NZ its difficult for us to know what and how things are looking in California ... I know there is still time for things to change and I am not nervous about getting the virus, just that it will disrupt our well laid plans, one big one of which is a our first week in Anaheim and much looked forward to time at DL and DCA ... I really think at present the only thing that would stop us going on our trip would be the closure of DLR and I am so hoping that the situation in California does not go crazy and this does not happen. I am very pleased to hear its business as usual right now ... I thought maybe attendance at the parks had dropped as the wait times on the APP seemed very reasonable at the mo and back up boarding groups for ROTR still available well after park opening too ... keeping everything crossed for things to settle down over the coming weeks ... as the virus risk is likely the same as staying at home in reality!So I say thank you Redhead (I am a red head too ... xx) ... I appreciate all the advice!PS - we are waiting a few weeks to make a final decision but have everything crossed to stick with our plans and have an amazing 3 week holiday in the US ...Edited: 10:00 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Nobody is accusing Disney of acting untoward. But it would be managerially irresponsible of the entrrprise not to have contingency plans, shared sufficiently with some supervisory level to effect a shutdown if it comes to that. We should not expect Disney to publish these plans, but they do have them on a contingency basis, trust me.Potential customers and visitors might also have contingency the plans, and perhaps one of the more difficult ones is to manage disappointment especially if coronavirus does not materialize to an extent such that Disney would actually shut down.Caution, concern, worry.....these are not unreasonable. But they are not necessarily determinative because of the uncertainties involved. So Red may have collected her ball to get out of the game, but Disney leadership is monitoring and planning and trying to get a handle on these uncertainties. We need to decide things too based on our risk management and risk tolerance....even though the extent of that risk remains unfixed."
"There's nothing stopping you from calling them yourself if you don't believe her. The phone number is +1 714 781 4000. Knock yourself out.In any case—from right here in sunny Anaheim—I am still not worried. The grocery stores have water, cleaning supplies, gloves, and toilet paper (apparently panic buyers only go to Costco, presumably because they want to have 1,200 rolls of Soviet splinter paper on their hands once the hysteria subsides). Restaurants and shops are open. People are out and about. Traffic is not noticeably better as it would be if large numbers of people were staying home.Wash your hands well. (And, honestly, if you have to be told to wash your hands, maybe reconsider traveling anywhere at all.) Cough into your sleeve. Stay home if you feel sick.That's it. That's the deal. No need to postpone unless you are truly a high-risk population (immunosuppressed, etc.).Edited: 11:26 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"We're very close to Sacramento and Vacaville, andno one here is doing much more than using hand sanitizer. So we're not panicked. But I'm about 98% leaning toward NOT going to Disneyland as planned on March 12. You're standing in line with strangers from all over the world, and people can have this virus and not know it, and they feel just fine. At some point, when there are more test kits, there will be cases of people who are at or have been to Disneyland, for sure. Why risk it?"
"These are almost my exact words today. Wondering about our planned trip at end of month. Remembering the measles park shut down. My husband says let everyone else stay away IFD fear and the lines will be less wait time. Not quite the answer I was thinking. My grand babies first trip to Disneyland also. I’m watching the news and they don’t even think masks help all that much.Brings to mind that song “Should I Sty or should I go.” My friends mother 83yr is on the cruise ship stuck in quarantine San Francisco last we heard from her she had a bad cough. Many on board sick. Praying for Gods miracles!!!I guess the only way we will not go on our trip is if the park shuts down. Or something worse happens.,."
"Very interested to hear that all is fairly normal in the area, as it is here where I live in NZ ... if we were traveling tomorrow we would go and I still hope in 4 weeks time it would be the same decision ... links now on my phone to CDC, IATA and Safe Travel NZ ... still a wait and see but will certainly be keeping an eye on the forums for changes in the local area. Thanks to those reporting in on the current situation. :-) Much appreciated."
"Natalie, just double check your travel insurance. We've got a similar trip planned at the end of March and just found that our Travel Insurance will not cover us if we get Coronavirus. We're less worried about the sickness itself, more with the potential of a massive hospital bill due to not being covered. We've booked more TI with CoverMore whosay they will cover us, but there's still a lot of grey area on what they will and will not cover."
"""Remembering the measles park shut down.""It didn't."
It happens worldwide so yes it does
"This is a helpful thread and one that I will continue to follow. Our trip to LA/Anaheim is due in two weeks time - we have spent months planning for it and have bought many non-refundable tickets including Hamilton which the kids have been looking forward to. Would be a huge disappointment to cancel but if we have to, we have to. I'm watching the developments closely and it's good to hear what others think. It's really a personal choice at the end of the day but these do help to provide different perspectives. And of course updates on what's happening on the ground since we are miles away and can only rely on media."
"Post 71-If you are responding about the measles outbreak that a previous poster said shut down the park. It did not.Edited: 12:45 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Thanks Ben ... yep have been in contact with them and been advised that we would be covered if fall ill due to Covid19 ... but it doesn't cover cancellation/amendment due to a pandemic/epidemic. I am not overly worried either about getting it, but also would hate to be in isolation in the US if happen to come in contact with someone who tests positive. We also have non refundable portions of our trip and airfares partially refundable, but our travel company said the waivers offered by the airline may change if the situation does ... so we wait and make an informed decision in a few weeks time."
"I live in Orange County. I hate to say it, but I’d be concerned. We have a large multi-cultural AFFLUENT community. Many travel internationally often and recently even a medical examiner at LAX airport has tested positive. I work in the public at large and usually don’t change my routine much—but this has many here taking precautions. MOST healthy people will probably fight the virus fine. But please don’t fool yourself into thinking you can possible attempt Disney with wipes and santitizer! It’s quite simply impossible! It was Disneyland after all that had an outbreak of measles on a large scale several years back. It is just the nature of such a crowded public place. Spring break will be even worse.My business here is expected to be reduced by 50%-66% unfortunately—-but it totally understand and support a person’s right to protect their families. I wish you the best as you decide what’s best for your family. The flu is not the same —contrary to what many believe."
Just to clarify there are no cases at Disney yet—-but there are cases in Orange County and a worker at LAX
"There were thousands of people on the previous Grand Princess cruise. Tracking down those people throughout California and around the world is a big deal.There are thousands of people of the ship now, waiting for tests results now before they can debarked.More schools are closing and many big companies are trlling their workers to work from home (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft).So little testing has been done so far that no one has a clue what the situation will be like a month from now. The best option is to remain flexible as long as possible.If you are flying, one good thing is that the planes will be less packed."
"What? It’s a respiratory virus. Of course it’s airborne. If you are in the healthcare profession you should know this. This is why we cover coughs/sneezes and try to stay at least 6 feet from those who are sick. Strange and misleading comment. I’m not saying don’t go to Disneyland, but if someone is a carrier and coughs/sneezes in your airspace, of course you can get it! (It’s how the droplets get on surfaces much of the time.) maybe you didn’t proof-read your reply."
">>>What? It’s a respiratory virus. Of course it’s airborne. If you are in the healthcare profession you should know this.<<<Are you in the medical profession? I am. Airborne/aerosol transmission is a very specific term for medical contagions. It means the particle stays in the air for a long period of time and you can breath it in after the person is long gone from the space. This is much much more contagious. In medical facilities patients have to be in a negative pressure room. Measles, TB, and chickenpox are in this category. Droplet transmission is where the contagion falls on surfaces and someone else has to touch that surface after and touch their eyes/nose/mouth to get infected. COVID at this point is considered droplet transmission.Edited: 7:30 am, March 06, 2020 "
"I think what we’re seeing on this thread is that, while there is some concern about getting sick, there’s even more concern about getting “stuck”, if you end up having to be quarantined or something. Those poor people on the diamond princess in Tokyo were on that ship for weeks, and then had to spend another 2 weeks in quarantine at a military base when they got home. And it’s especially worrying for us foreigners if we could get stuck in the US. I’m not sure if many Americans appreciate how big a factor your health care system is for international travelers when deciding whether to go. I’m Canadian, I travel a lot, I have travel medical insurance through my employer and I usually buy extra for vacations. If I go anywhere else in the world, the cost for supplemental travel medical is pretty minimal for up to 30 days, but if I’m even transiting through the US (even if I’m on a flight that lands in the US and I don’t actually get off the plane), the cost for that coverage quadruples. The US is the only country I visit where my number one medical-related concern is bankruptcy. So while I might not be particularly worried about getting the illness, if there is even a slight possibility that I could end up with a 6-figure hospital bill and my insurance wouldn’t cover me, that’s a deal breaker for me."
"Yikkie, since you are from BSB you might travel here through Singapore. With smart, stringent, and science led approaches, Singapore is doing a great job containing the outbreak. We are geometrically bigger, far less disciplined, weaker grasp of science including in our national government leadership.Do exercise care in coming our way. Would be a shame to cancel."
"My daughter is taking my 2 yr old grand baby to Disneyland this today. I personally would have waited but at the same token, I feel that you have to be mindful of germs always not just now. Take sanitizing wipes, hand sanitizers, wash your hand whenever possible with soap and water, and do not touch your face. If you see or hear someone sneezing or showing signs of a cold etc, run the other way lol. I always do that at the grocery stores or anywhere I go, regardless. But in all seriously I dont think people should stop living and enjoying life. If you have a health condition already then I would say dont go, but if you are otherwise healthy, go and enjoy. Just be mindful of those germs around you."

I’m a annual passholder at Disney we had plans in April to stay at the grand Californian and celebrate my daughter(s) birthday for a week. As soon as I saw the virus hit United States I canceled. I will not be returning until most likely after September to the parks. So roughly that’s about a good six months I’m paying for four passes and not using them. I would rather be safe then sorry. We love Disney but Disney loves money they have only closed I believe twice in the whole time of Disneyland being around. Too much travelers and in very tight spaces off and on rides I doubt they can keep a big contamination out.
My best friend just got back on Wednesday night from Disneyland and she is doing just fine. Just continue to wash hands and use your normal things you do to not get sick. Simple as that.
Hi there!We are leaving on march 18th for DisneylandLet us know how things are and how was the trip. I hope you have a great and safe trip.
"The nation's largest nutritional supplement and food convention has postponed their convention in Anaheim that should be taking place this weekend.Expo West was supposed to take place at the Anaheim Convention Center this week.Additionally, the Pac-12 Conference has issued a statement on the postseason basketball tournament in Las Vegas. Three other athletic leagues take place in Vegas as well, and there have been cancellations by fans.Disneyland might be clean enough to be sterile, but if you must travel to LAX to get there, you have no guarantees that the person that previously touched what you just touched and then wiped your itchy eye wasn't infected.The under-reported news is that people that have contracted the virus and then recovered are still testing positive and can actually get the virus again, unlike seasonal flu. People that had it and recovered and returned to their normal daily routines were still contagious. Some people have actually had it twice this winter."
"The theme throughout this thread is individual risk management and risk tolerance.Disney I’m sure is trying to keep ahead by doing what it can. But only so much it can do. It should be noted that Disney has partners in its Asian parks, and so decisions in Asia to close reflect factors not in play in Anaheim and Orlando."

The expo was cancelled because the primary exhibitors are large companies who have issued travel bans. Can't have a convention without primary exhibitors.

From CDChttps:/…children-faq.html>>>Who is at Higher RiskOlder adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease seem to be at higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness. Early data suggest older people are twice as likely to have serious COVID-19 illness. <<<She is more at risks for influenza which is still very active here in California.Also depends on severity of her asthma.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"We are going to be watching and waiting. It seems clearer by the day that our country’s response to this is botched due to lack of preparation (gee maybe disbanding the cdc’s pandemic unit was not a good idea). I keep reading stories like the cruise ship stuck off SF had people coughing and hacking yet no one was monitored, nurses who are infected can’t get tested, etc. Hence, we are being cautious. You can’t be sure infected people aren’t anywhere. Each day new states and cities announce cases. Also, if you aren’t at all worried, feel free to avoid this thread. Not sure why certain people are so affronted that people are making their own risk-benefit analyses. Obviously Disneyland’s not gonna tell people who call that there’s a chance they will close. And even if Disney is not currently planning for potential closure, who knows whether that will be the case tomorrow or next week."
"Shcheepmom, you asked if anyone else was concerned. Some are. Some aren’t. Many came here and gave you information and went beyond what most would do by making phone calls, sharing YouTube channels etc. You mocked. Not even a thank you to Red. I think our administration is doing the best that can be done."
"Bravo roxy.Pediatric healthcare provider here. I work and live in Santa Clara County (Silicon Valley if you are not familiar)where we have the highest number of cases in the state. No one is panicking. Some schools are closed due to contacts with infected person or actual infected person. We have folks that travel all over the world in our area.Stay calm and wash your hands. My daughter and all of my colleagues' kids are still attending preschool or school. We are more worried about childcare issues if schools are closed. (already an issue for several of my colleagues).CDC is not perfect but it's the best we have. I am following their recommendations. What one chooses to do is their own choice.Edited: 4:18 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Disney is a very well run enterprise. Its top management fully appreciates the huge reputational and financial hit it would incur if it became a hot spot for a pandemic. So I’m positive the personnel are taking preventive and pre-emptive measures even as they assess risk management themselves. I “know” this based on my pre-retirement profession, and although I never worked with Disney I did with similar crowd entertainment parks including on contingency planning....implemented incidentally in the aftermath of the March 11, 2011 earthquake/tsunami/nuclear disaster in Japan.That being said, individual decisions should be made on data that, like it or not, have a lot of uncertainties. This is unlike a nuclear disaster in which the emissions are measurable and the diffusion pattern more clear. It is much like SARS and H1N1 which I also have experience with when living in Guangzhou....an epicenter.I provided a list of resources in #83. They are not directly tied to Disneyland or Anaheim, but you can make use of them in individual decision-making which obviously is tied to individual medical conditions which can be discussed with your own medical professionals."
>>>There seems to be little information available about how this is affecting children with asthma.<<<Because that information isn't there yet. The CDC is actively gathering data to check prevalence of the virus in the community and not just people with risk factors. More information will be available soon. I have said this elsewhere. My gut feeling is that this won't go away. Remember H1N1? It was scary when it first showed up in 2009. Now it's one of the many strains of influenza we see each season.
"South Korea has initiated a ""drive thru"" testing program which can test almost 400 people a day. We are no where near that. The CDC has been defunded especially in this area. Right now we know almost zero about this virus because various governments (Chinese, Iranian, US) are completely inept and/or trying to downplay the issue. The president's ""hunch"" ... someone's ""gut"" ... gosh I feel more secure already."
I ain't saying it's perfect. We were talking about the Korean drive through at work.My gut feeling is similar to that of many of my colleagues who collectively have some wealth and breadth of experience. We know more than zero about this virus.
"Pardon me, the Korean drive through is actually more of a gimmick. In point of fact, the Korean public health system is far better organized than ours, and even without the drive through, there already has been a flexing of that public health system muscle in monitoring and checking. It helps that there is an epicenter in Daegu which accounts for over 70% of the cases so far and that 50% are centered on members of a religious cult...the Shincheonji.Also culture matters. The Korean public as a whole are pretty media and science savvy, and by and large their public service bureaucracy functions very well. Among the best educated people in the world.That’s one reason why it was a pleasure to live in Korea for a dozen years spaced through parts of three decades."

"Disney faces a problem endemic to the situation. It can and does take steps to enhance the safe environment of its facilities for its visitors, but it cannot assure that its visitors have taken responsible steps to protect themselves. Other places like the San Diego Zoo have taken similar measures to enhance health safety within its facilities. But Disney visitors are far more numerous than in other places, which means that the uncertainties stemming from the health status of its visitors are also magnified. Consequently, the argument that people continue to visit Disney...or the zoo...or any other venue with large volumes of visitors ....lack absolute assurance value. Further it is undercut by cancellations of gatherings of large numbers of people. To be sure, the justification is an abundance of caution, but nobody can be certain that the caution is sufficiently abundant.Personally, we intend to continue to go to places despite being viewed as vulnerable because of our age and chronic health issues. But, for example, the San Francisco Public Health Department has just announced a recommendation advocating social distancing, i.e., avoiding group activities.So it is not unreasonable for OP to have concerns and to be dissatisfied by assurances from “destination experts” that, in the end, might be reasonable but cannot be ironclad.Edited: 2:01 am, March 09, 2020 "
"You have to make an assessment based on your own risk factors and tolerance of risk.If you and under 60 and very healthy, you are very unlikely to die even if you get the virus. If you are OK with getting mildly ill, you should not worry much.The size of crowds at Disneyland makes it somewhat more complicated, because it makes social distancing more difficult. It would not be as great a risk as SXSW, which was just cancelled. If you have options to travel at other times or less crowded places, that may be a better option. And by the end of the month, if they can really ramp up testing, we may have a better understanding of the scope of the problem.The lack of significant testing so far has driven the tremendous uncertainty that we are all facing."
We r flying from Vancouver island April 26 should we be worried
"Liars, Don't do that! Do not use quotes for ""destination expert"". I may be a DE but it doesn't mean I should be a target for sarcasm, derision, and put downs. I was nominated by my fellow members of this forum and I am not paid staff nor do I expect any of accolades. Frankly I get a little tired of my status being thrown in my face anytime someone decides to be discourteous to do so. I am only doing my best just like you.Edited: 12:03 am, March 08, 2020 "
Liars—exactly.
I can not agree with post #106 more! Very well said
"Yes, and many people in the United States have some immuno-response to flu strains. This is a novel virus. And for all the people recommending that you wipe down everything in Disney with hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes seem to be overlooking the fact that the supplies are basically no longer available in any store or online. And even if you doused everything in rubbing alcohol and washed your hands every five minutes, if you’re standing in line with people who are coughing and sneezing on your face, it doesn’t matter how clean you are or how many times Disney employees wash tables and sidewalks."
Disney is going an extra mile by providing sufficient resources for visitors to maintain a healthy approach. But this is somewhat akin to restaurants in which all employees are required to wash and dry hands thoroughly but with no such requirement for diners....although hopefully most diners so so.But diners can mostly harm themselves in a food environment but strangers waiting in lines are a different story. And Covid19 is a droplet spread viral disease with the resilience of the virus in a droplet as yet unknown.
"While “social distancing” is being encouraged in other localities. We are told: Don’t be in a group of more than 50, stay 6 feet away from others. SF Symphony and SF Ballet performances cancelled. Docent tours at the FAMSF museum cancelled. Indian Wells tennis tournament cancelled. But people are going to queue up at Disneyland for hours next to a bunch of strangers. Good luck.Edited: 5:49 am, March 09, 2020 "
Not worried at all. Went the last 2 weekends with my kids and parents and no issues or concerns.
"Since NOBODY has been tested for COVID 19 in Orange County, there are no reported cases. But thousands of people have developed respiratory illness and pneumonia. Some of those are probably COVID 19. I am a local in Orange County and there is definitely concern here. Don't let anyone tell you there isn't. Disneyland is one level safer than a cruise ship. The only positive about a visit there this month is that there MIGHT be fewer other guests because they were wise enough to stay away."
">>>Since NOBODY has been tested for COVID 19 in Orange County, there are no reported cases.<<<Not true at all. OC has been testing and there is 1 confirmed case and 3 presumptive cases, all travel related.ochealthinfo.com/phs/…novel_coronavirus"
"Even though Anaheim has not declared an emergency, Orange County has. It is unclear if cities within a county are bound by what the county declares, and the precipitating case was one in Costa Mesa.BTW that one family or five families or a hundred families have visited Disney with no problems does not mean one should not be worried at all. After all, even Disney is worried which is why it is undertaking extraordinary measures to keep facilities clean and encouraging guests to practice good hygiene.Edited: 7:22 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Speaking as a local: I hate to say it but many of us fear exposure from thousands of international tourists visiting Disneyland. Right now, I'm not going the 12 miles from my house to Anaheim or even the 4 miles to the Hyatt Huntington Beach, where I have a spa membership. I just cancelled my reservation with a Group for the White House Anaheim. Oh -- and to make things worse, we're expecting a major rain storm, starting tonight, March 9 and continuing through Friday, March 13."
"After some deliberation, we have decided to postpone our trip to LA/Anaheim to October. That means a shorter trip for us unfortunately as the Oct mid-term break for our kids is only 1 week, as opposed to 2 weeks in March. However we would rather not worry about the risk of infection, quarantine, and all the other constraints present at this time when COVID-19 is fast escalating. Of course there is no guarantee that this will be over by October, but we are really keeping our fingers crossed that the situation would improve substantially in the next few months! Disappointed but relieved :)"
"I’d like to reiterate what I said earlier in this thread. It’s true that currently the risk of actually getting sick is pretty small. But, especially for international visitors, there is more to consider here than “will I get sick”. Things are normal there now, sure - 4 weeks ago things were normal in Italy, and now half the country is on lockdown. Cities like Tokyo, Paris, Milan went from “everything’s fine” to “everything’s closed” in a matter of days, and the prospect of being caught up in that as a foreign visitor is pretty concerning. There is a risk, albeit a small one, that one could find themselves travelling to a place where everything shuts down, and you are confined to your hotel room. There is a risk - again small but not zero - that one could be exposed to the virus and find themselves in quarantine, making their trip days or weeks longer than planned. Those poor people on the Princess cruise ships were stuck for weeks, and then had to spend more time in quarantine at a military base after getting home. And with the American medical system being what it is, there is a risk of serious financial consequences if you find yourself needing medical attention, or even needing medical testing, and not being covered by your travel insurance. “Should I go anyway?” is a question everyone needs to answer for themselves, because only you can decide what your tolerance is to these risks. But, point being there’s more to it than just the health risks, and travelling internationally is a gamble right now."
"Well said @RIMgeek, those were exactly our concerns for international travel at this point in time. For us, there's too much at stake and a vacation is supposed to be fun and not overshadowed by all the negative ""what-ifs"".Edited: 12:09 am, March 10, 2020 "
"Given the spread of the virus and the spread of cancelations and closures in California and elsewhere in the U.S., prudence and caution should indeed be hallmarks even without waiting for Disney to make what would be a painful decision imho.Sorry you had to forego the trip, but safety first."
"We’re flying out after being here since Saturday. Parks are very busy and no fearful looking people. We saw one couple yesterday with face masks. Everything seemed business as usual. We took extra precautions and wiped down tables if when we sat at one and washing and hand sanitizing as we went along as you should. Lots of people! Grossed out whenever I see the kiddos running hands over the handrails and then putting their fingers in their mouths! Gross, anyway and kids are kids. You can’t stop that. So I know things are changing day by day, but right now, it’s business as usual at the park. No one in my party has anything but exhaustion! I’m glad we didn’t cancel. Stay healthy everyone!"
"""After some deliberation, we have decided to postpone our trip to LA/Anaheimto October.""Your choice. Keep in mind currently medical officials speculate it will take AT LEAST 12 months until a vaccine is developed. October is only 7 months away. It's also the beginning of the usual cold and flu season here. Fall, beginning with September and October, can the bring strong dry winds in Southern California that are called Santa Anas. The combination of Santa Anas and dry brush that summer heat creates can mean fires in Southern California. Although the immediate area surrounding Disneyland Resort is not normally affected by fires, when traveling to other places in Southern California such as LA during fire season the air could have particulates that cause respiratory problems. October is a busy time at Disneyland Resort parks because many locals love their Halloweentime celebrations and special nighttime parties.You probably will either want to rethink your decision to postpone and go when you originally planned to OR put off your trip for a year or more or until you know for sure a vaccine is developed and being distributed. Up to you.Edited: 8:19 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"My daughter’s band trip to Disney was cancelled today. They were going the last weekend in March. With so many unknowns and restrictions being added daily, they cancelled vs. paying for the trip and then having to cancel without getting the money back. I’m relieved, since I was leaning toward keeping her home due to her compromised immune system. Looks like our spring break trip to visit colleges will be a no go as well. Living in a remote/rural area, I stay sane by traveling as much as possible. This is a huge bummer."
"""Grossed out whenever I see the kiddos running hands over the handrails and then putting their fingers in their mouths! Gross, anyway and kids are kids. You can’t stop that.""Actually it's this kind of behaviour that keeps super bugs at bay.All the over sanitisation people do is the main reason everyone gets so sick these days. No immunity."
"Galaga_girl does have a point. Anti-bacterial products have resulted in bacteria evolving, for example. Plus there is a distinction between bacteria and viruses. A lot of hand sanitizers are not alcohol based.....60% level necessary against viruses.....and while okay against bacterial infections do little against viruses. Meanwhile the overprescription of Tamiflu in Japan in particular over the years has substantially weakened the efficacy of that drug against flu and other viral infections.That Purelle in your pocket might only go so far."
"It is worth noting that even though Santa Clara County and San Francisco have banned gatherings of 1000 people or more, the gorilla in the south, Los Angeles, with under 20 cases so far confirmed, is not in a state of emergency nor moving beyond CDC guidelines. As a main gateway to Anaheim and Disney that might inform some people contemplating travel.Please also note that WHO has just declared this to be a global pandemic."
I am going at the beginning of April with my family. Yes this has crossed my mind as well. I am doing the same as you with going by car and we could cancel if need be. I have been doing lots of research. I work in the nursing field along with my husband. I am sure as long as your making sure you and your family are washing your hands and using hand sanitizer often it should be ok. I did find this as well https:/…
"Kristina B, you are being a responsible visitor which will help Disney keep operating."
">> I am sure as long as your making sure you and your family are washing your hands and using hand sanitizer often it should be ok.<<I have to ask ... how does that help if you're in a huge crowd and people are sneezing, coughing or whatever. (Although I understand that this virus is ""low respiratory rather than upper.) And as people touch their face 20+ times an hour (or so I've read) can you really sanitize your hands that often? TBH ... I cannot understand how Disneyland has remained open and I find it irresponsible that they have."
"I’m out. Just cancelled hotel reservations. Good luck everyone, hope you stay healthy."
"OP, appreciate the reasoning behind your decision. Not to wish its closing, but with the CDC encouraging crowd avoidance, and with so many organizations and events suspending mass audience events, Disney may have to make decisions of its own soon."
then why did you even reply?
"Disneyland closing, finally"
"Its not closed yet. It's still open until the end of the month. Post the closing date. Then have your party.This was in respect for what the Governor has said, btw. Nothing wrong.Edited: 4:57 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Um no, it’s closing on Saturday until at least the end of the month, following on the state’s decision to ban gatherings over 250 people.https:/…At no point in this entire thread or any of the others has anyone accused Disneyland of hiding anything or doing anything wrong. But they are now doing the responsible thing in light of the rapidly changing situation."
The closure of Disneyland begins 3/14 and currently runs through the end of the month. About time.
"I posted backward. Closing ENDS at the end of the month.Now, are you happy?? Umm, no."
"""Closing ENDS at the end of the month.""Don't count on it."
Why would you think we're happy? We're not happy about this whole thing. But you are taking it waaayyyy too personally. I'll believe reopenings on 4/1 when I see them.
"But someone on here assured us it would NEVER close!Props to Disney, finally doing the right thing. It doesn’t matter how well or often they clean the bathrooms, etc. that won’t prevent someone from coughing on you in line. And recent studies show the virus can remain active on steel for days. Was Disney wiping down and sanitizing each square inch of surface a person could touch on each ride between each and every run? I highly doubt it. So if someone infected holds on to the roller coaster rail and then you get on the ride...and there has been hardly any testing in this country so the “no reported cases” yet talking point is meaningless."
I can’t imagine anyone being happy. I think most expected this to finally happen and are relieved. Especially if you work at the parks or know someone who does or you live in the area etc. This is going to get worse before it gets better. Disney needed to do its part to stop the possible spread. Is WDW next? Can you imagine?
"Re: post #146 - strangely all of those posts seem to have disappeared... I would like to echo others saying kudos to Disney for continuing to pay your employees during the shutdown, you are setting a great example for corporate responsibility here.Edited: 6:10 pm, March 12, 2020 "
""" For Disneyland guests, the company pledged in its statement to work with guests “who wish to change or cancel their visits, and will provide refunds to those who have hotel bookings during this closure period.” With travel increasingly discouraged, and more and more reactions and shutdowns from the entertainment industry, there could be further changes in the coming day ""With that last paragraph stated, I wish ALL resorts would offer refunds. Sadly, I've been on hold w/WorldMark Anaheim to beg for my credits back for 90min--now. This was completely out of MY control and we were suppose to arrive on the 21st!Edited: 8:17 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"The long-term reputation of companies will depend on how well they treat their customers in a time of stress. If you are treated poorly, tell you you will not do business with them in the future and will tell your friends/put it on social media.Disneyland relented AFTER the Governor twisted their arm to the breaking point similar to the Mayor of SF and the Warriors."
"In response to post #43, no where does it say the park WILL reopen at the of the month. It will remain closed AT LEAST till the end of the month. Possibly longer."
"Given the severity of the situation, the Governor did the right thing by not taking it lightly. Glad we are not going ahead with our trip since a lot of attractions will be closed in addition to Disneyland - USH, The Broad etc. Hopefully these measures will be effective in containing the spread and safeguarding everyone's interest. Stay safe all! We looking forward to visiting in the near future!Edited: 11:06 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We were on the road from our San Francisco home to our San Diego home when we heard on NPR what Governor Newsom said about not closing Disney but talking to Iger and saying he would speak again. My wife immediately remarked Iger's going to close Disney, and Newsom was just giving Disney the room to do so gracefully. And so it turned out.Nobody is happy about closures of anything. Nobody is glad about Covid19.Stay safe. Let us hope that those testing kits get manufactured in huge quantities and that people practice social distancing.Really proud of Governor Newsom.Edited: 1:38 am, March 13, 2020 "
"It was pretty miserable driving through Anaheim last night, and today ....Friday.....is pretty miserable too in Anaheim. Rainy. Hope would be visitors on “last” day take that into consideration."
"With Knotts also closing, two famous Orange County theme parks are out of the game.I hope Knotts is as generous as Disney to its employees. BTW “cast member” is just Disneyspeak for regular employees."
