"Hi, does anyone have any weblinks/gov office contact details that could shed light on what Iceland’s next lockdown response might be if they can’t regain control of the recent spike in COVID infections?A friend and I want to visit for 10 days in 2 weeks time but we'd like to assess (to the best of our ability) what a worst-case scenario might look like before committing to flights. We have Norway as a back-up option but we want to make that a decision sooner rather than later. If we had to cancel at the final hour we'd stand to lose our Iceland flights, 1st week of Airbnb, plus forking out for expensive last min Norway flights and accom. Not ideal. Our Iceland itinerary consists of outdoor sites off the beaten path, so we're primarily concerned about getting into the country and whether they might introduce stricter testing for sub-10 day trips.Hopefully someone can point us in the direction of additional info should it exist. Thanks.Edited: 6:45 am, August 04, 2020 "
"You can find the current regulations on covid.isI don't think there is any reliable way to predict what will happen next.If I was you, I would plan to stay in Reykjavík for the first two nights. That's what I did during my recent visit, plus I booked my accommodation for the first few days after that last minute to make sure I would not be stuck with non-refundable accommodation.Sounds like you already fully committed to your Airbnb, but I hope you are not staying in the same place for your whole visit, since doing day trips from one base for ten days will severely restrict what you can see and do and will lead to lots of unnecessary driving and backtracking."
Thanks Kim. We haven't booked flights or accom just yet - I was only projecting what we stood to lose in a last min cancellation scenario. I spoke to someone at the dept. of health. They're carrying out tests today and tomorrow with the aim of having a more informed view of the scale of the current problem by the end of the week. Will hold tight till then.
"I have planned to go to Iceland in a couple of week too. I have booked everything in order to be as flexible as possible. If further restrictions apply and I will not be able to go, I would loose approx. 150 euros, that's all. Everything else can be cancelled. I do not think anyone, at this stage, can predict further or less restrictions. We just have to wait and see. In some official websites, I have read that they reassess restrictions every 15 days so I presume the next one is probably due around the 15th of August, but anything can happen, even in between the reassessments.Edited: 1:24 pm, August 04, 2020 "

"I'm supposed to arrive in Iceland on September 8th so hopefully things settle down over the next few weeks,,,"
"“We have Norway as a back-up option...”You may want to rethink that option at this time! Below are links to very recent news reports, made here in Toronto (Canada), about the possible spread of the Covid virus to Norwegian communities, by passengers from a cruise ship in Norway:Yesterday: “Outbreak hits Norway cruise ship, could spread along coast” https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/ou…Today: “ Norway cruise ship passengers with coronavirus reach 43” https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/norway-cruise-s…>>>> Excerpt from the second report: “But since the cruise line often acts like a local ferry, travelling from port to port along Norway's west coast, some passengers disembarked along the route and may have spread the virus to local communities. A total of 69 municipalities in Norway could have been affected, Norwegian news agency NTB reported on Monday.”"
Great share - thanks for this
"The Norway info is incorrect, it is NOT the ""local ferry"" but two expedition cruises to Svalbard, run by the Hurtigruten cruise company. Some 40 contaminated, mostly crew, all in isolation.At the moment we have a very low virus spread compared to Iceland and other European countries.Official data here https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"You’re welcome. I’m sure the local public health dept will be all over this, to try to keep it from spreading, but it’s still good to be aware of the situation."
"Most of the contaminated were crew, a few are in hospital, the rest are in isolation at a hotel in Tromsø. It is an unfortunate situation, but not as dramatic as it sounds from the press that cannot even get the facts right.Iceland is on a rapid rise though, Norwegians going to Iceland now would have to quarantine on return."
"@ klimaflyktningThe article does not say it IS the local ferry...it says “ often acts LIKE A LOCAL FERRY, travelling from port to port “I can understand the misunderstanding because of the way it was phrased so I capitalized the important words. Here in Canada, we have ferries that travel along the areas of remote coastline, or between small islands, making frequent stops in the small communities. Apparently this cruise ship was making frequent stops in small communities along Norway’s western coast where passengers and crew members MAY have disembarked WHILE the cruise ship was in the small ports, POSSIBLY transmitting the infection to members of the small communities.As I tried to express in my previous post, I have confidence in Norway’s medical community to manage this well. Having said that, in my opinion, ANYONE thinking of travelling to Norway needs to be aware of this situation; for that matter, this may be another example of why EVERYONE might want to delay travelling ANYWHERE for a while, particularly on a cruise ship or other space where you are forced to interact regularly with a large number of different people outside your own “bubble” of regular contacts.Edit: I apologize for capitalizing certain words; I’m not yelling them out just emphasizing them because I’m unable to post using italics. Be safe everyone!Edited: 6:32 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"But this was NOT the coatal ferry, it was a particular expedition cruise between Tromsø and Svalbard, manned with a Philippino crew. Passengers were all Norwegian. Hurtigruten as a company runs the coastal ferry along the Norwegian coast but also runs expedition cruises around the world on purpose built vessels, hence the confusion. All further cruises have been cancelled.Hurtigruten coastal ferry is still running, no virus there.Agree that a cruise is not really the safest way to travel nowadays, I would not risk it personally.Edited: 6:51 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"@klimaflyktningNeither myself nor the linked news reports stated that this boat was “the coastal ferry” but instead referred to it as “a cruise ship in Norway”. I did not watch the videos before my first post, however the same Associated Press report is available on multiple websites by searching the internet for “MS Roald Amundsen”. In post #12 you state that “Passengers were all Norwegian.” Does that make the situation any better? Maybe, because, as I have already indicated two times, the Norwegian medical authorities will likely try to stop this outbreak from spreading further within Norway.Regardless, as a still developing situation, https:/… , someone considering a trip to Norway should be aware of it, don’t you think?"
"This is the wrong part “But since the cruise line often acts like a local ferry, travelling from port to port along Norway's west coast, some passengers disembarked along the route and may have spread the virus to local communities""The two expedition vessels in question have nothing to do with the fleet doing the cruise-ferry voyage along the Norwegian coast. All passengers embarked and disembarked in Tromsø and have not been cruising along the coast. Not all passengers were from Tromsø though, and as Hurtigruten failed to inform the passengers in a timely manner, many were on their way home to wherever in Norway when the situation came out. So, yes, there is a modest spread beyond Tromsø.Norwegians are easier to trace and follow up. As seen on the map in this link https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea there are still regions in Norway with no spread, including the popular Lofoten Islands. What the situation in Iceland and Norway will be in two weeks' time would be anybody's guess, Currently Norway beats Iceland for cases, time will show if the Norwegian stricter approach to travelling will pay off.Edited: 2:09 am, August 05, 2020 "
