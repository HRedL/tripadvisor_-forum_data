"I am going to Tunisia next Friday, I live in the UK. Ebola is spreading worldwide and could possibly go to Tunisia, I am quite worried. Ebola is expected to arrive in the UK by the 24th October.But I more worried about going to Tunisia I know it isn't in Tunisia but an is possible within the next 7 days right? I went to Tunisia last year and obviously had no problems except my Nan who got sick for 3 three days most probably cause of the food. Other than that no problems, I have went on the Tunisian website and they haven't put anything about Ebola on it?Should I be worried?!"
"I am visiting last week November, I think the area of Tunisia is relevant regarding Ebola, if visiting the maintourists part such as Hammamet you are OK! ie as OK as anywhere else that is!"
"No,I go in three weeks myself.there is Ebola in America, Spain, and Australia just now, would you be worried about going there on holiday ?"
Because it's in Africa where it's originated from and it's not in the UK yet.Edited: 5 years ago 
I think the chance you will get it in Tunisia might even be smaller then you get when you are in your home country....
"How is it expected to arrive in the UK by 24th Oct????Why that specific date? Has it bought a cheap holiday deal or summat? Lol.Sorry couldnt help myself!!Seriously tho, i think you will be ok.Considering Tunisia is North Africa and Tunisia have no flights arriving from the West of Africa where the virus is then i think you chances are minimal!!Ive just arrived back at 12.35am today, and id be on the next flight back to Tunisia if i could."
I am going Yasmine Hammamet
I don't know it just said on the news lol. And thank you.
"Whatever resort you are staying in louise i think you will be ok, Yasmine, Hammamet, or Port el Kantaoui, you will be fine, just go and enjoy!!"
"Travel on 2nd November , and not even thinking about such a thing , life must go on , staying at phenicia , and gunna enjoy it ,, don't think of things like that , HAVE FUN"
"We are there from 23 rd November for 2 weeks ,first time ,looking forward to it. HopeTo see you there."
"According to various sources Ebola has a fifty percent chance of arriving in the UK. This is based on research conducted by Lancaster Uni. They have been investigating the flight patterns. Sierra Leone is located over 2000 miles away from Tunisia. The reason there have been cases in the USA, and UK is due to humanitarian aid workers falling ill with the virus in parts of Western Africa. Please do not worry, enjoy your holiday. If you're really worried buy a thermometer, check your temperature and your families regularly whilst on holiday purely for peace of mind."
The FCO - Foreign Commonwealh Office would ban travel to Tunisia if there was an epidemic in order to contain it.
"Id go and enjoy yourself. Ive just got back from Florida and it was all over the news there as well scaring people.Just make sure you wash your hands reguarly, take a bottle of sanitiser and dont eat anything dodgy looking! I read today that you can only catch it once the person is quite ill from it, you cant catch it from sitting next to anyone on a plane apparently who hasn't yet become quite ill. I dont know how that works to be honest but thats what I read.Ive been to Tunisia a couple of times and im looking to go again soon, ive never become ill whilst staying at the Phenecia which is where we stayed both times."
You should all know that Tunisia has never had an ebola outbreak since it was first discovered in 1976. The likelihood of it arriving here is next to nothing. I live in Tunisia we are not worried here. Please come and enjoy your holiday with us
You should also be aware that ebola is exchanged through body fluids ok?? Read about it and make yourselves knowledgeable and that way you will stay safe and well
But Lesley by the exchange of bodily fluids means it can be transmitted by being close to the infected person while they speak...via saliva.
"I am not a doctor or nurse but as far as I know it are only persons that are in close contact with an ill person that risk to get ill also.If it would be by only saliva you can not go out anymore on any bus, tram, train,... in all the parts of the world !!"
Maenan I believe Lily is a nurse So I assume she will know causes of spread of this terrible disease.Saliva is oneEdited: 5 years ago 
"I have read and looked at the news regularly about it, believe me I am the first person people should come to if they don't know any thing about Ebola. Am back now anyway."
"So what can you tell us about Ebola then Louise?You went to Tunisia and survived just like we all have? LolI'm glad you went in the end. See, nothing really to worry about was there?"
