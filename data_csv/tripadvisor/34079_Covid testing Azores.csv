"Hello, Anyone who traveled to Azores and who got accepted with a (negative) COVID test performed within the valid delay in another country ? We will be flying in from Belgium in August and will have our tests taken in Belgium. We hope they will accept as we fly to Pico next day. Everybody seems to get a test on arrival ? Thank you !"
"We will be flying in from Belgium in August and will have our tests taken in Belgium - if it's a PCR test and it's done within the 72h interval it's valid. ""you have already been tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus on the 72 hours preceding your flight to the Azores and the result was negative. In this case you will have to show the physical document issued by a lab that proves that the test for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed within the 72 hours before your departure from the origin airport. That document should contain your identification, the lab where the test was performed, the date of the test, the signature of the people who performed the test, and the NEGATIVE result. If the stay will be longer than seven days, the passenger should, on the 6th day from the date SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, contact the health services of the county where you are staying so that another test can be performed by the Health Authorities that will inform you of the result.""CONNECTIONS INTER-ISLANDSIf you intend to travel inter-islands, either by air or by sea, you do not need a previous authorisation from the Regional Health Authority, and you should act as follows:a) The passengers should communicate that intent, on arrival, to the health authority by filling in the proper form;b) The passengers that perform the SARS-CoV-2 test on arrival to the Region, in case they have another island as final destination, must remain in prophylactic isolation at the place they are lodged or in a hotel room designated for that purpose, until they are informed of the NEGATIVE result of the test. Only then may they proceed with their trip;c) The passengers that present a previous NEGATIVE SARS-CoV-2 test, in case they have another island as final destination, may go to that island;d) The above mentioned passengers, as soon as they arrive to the final destination island, must oblige to the procedures previewed in the part concerning the contact to the County Health Authority on the 6th day to perform the SARS-CoV-2 test.The official document (it may change till August, but not very likelly) https:/…AAs_20200615_VF.pdf"
"We have taken test on arrival 3 days ago. There are plenty of people arriving with negative test done on beforehand (about 50 pct from our flight). Most got accepted.However make sure your test is within 72 hours from ARRIVAL in Azores, not departure. That is what seems to count here."
"How long did it take to get your results after the test on arrival? Do they guarantee a maximum turn around time (24 hrs, 48 hrs)? Can you pick your hotel to isolate while waiting for your results? Thank you for any information you can provide, it will help with our trip planning."
"HelloThey tell you it takes 12 to 48 h to get the results and provide a number to call if you did not get results within 48 h, we had to call that number and got our results once we got through.You can go to your hotel or rental house after doing the test but you should isolate there until you get the results."
We will visit for 10 days from Sept 5th We will need a second covid test after 6 days. Do we pay for this?
"We will need a second covid test after 6 days. Do we pay for this? No you don't pay, it's paid by the local government."
i would like to have our COVID test done in the UK. Can anyone recommend a firm who satisfies the requirements (Cheaper than £250 per person would be a bonus!)
"I am going to have mine done on the NHS drive through 72 hours before we fly out. When are you flying out? Can you let me know how you got on when you arrived? Thanks, Good Luck with your test."
"#8 post, as officially you need to have symptoms or be in one of the special cases that needs testing I was wondering how you are going to get the free test. Also if you do, whether it is accepted on arrival.Thanks"
Yes - I don't feel comfortable about taking a free NHS test without having symptoms. I will pay privately but I would be interested in anyone's experience of this. Flying out on Sept 5th via Ryan Air.
"Hi Rita, same day as us, we then fly to Pico a few days later then Terceira and then home...Don't think can get money back on either Ryanair flights, inter island flights or hotels (at the moment, all may change in 5 weeks..) so still undecided what to do..."
Flew in yesterday after taking a negative test in Spain. Our test results were not accepted as it was rapid type test and we we were made to retest here and wait for results.On travel advice being quoted there is no mention of the test type.I dont think we were the only people caught out like this...
"The type of test is clearly stated on the official information by the Azores government and in all of the posts about it here. It's a PCR test, a little time spent doing some homework shows it easily."
We are on the same flight as you and also wondering where to take the test in the Uk. We are thinking of trying the NHS one but we are not sure if it will be valid and if we will get the result on time.
"Not sure who post 14,15 was aimed at, but we are coming to conclusion of being tested when we arrive. I've been told NHS doesn't specify which test so will probably be rejected and I can't find private tests locally. Also there's the test on the 6th day after date of first test. If we get tested before we fly then that will fall on day we fly to Pico and whilst I know you don't have to isolate while waiting for results of second test we might find it difficult to test and fly on same day."
"Does anyone know if there are COVID test locations on Flores? We will initially arrive in Sao Miguel and then fly to Flores once we receive the negative result from our test on arrival (3 days later). What I am concerned about is the requirement for the 2nd COVID test on the 6th day, which would occur when we are planning to be in Flores. If there are no facilities to conduct the 2nd test in Flores, could we be prevented from going to the island in this case?"
"Does anyone know if there are COVID test locations on Flores? Yes, all the islands will have a place to collect the sample. At arrival you have to fill a form saying that you are going to do an inter-island flight and information about where to go will be given. https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl… The sample will fly to Terceira or S. Miguel to be analysed."
"Hello i'd like to fill out the Covid questionnaire form (in advance) required upon arrival at the airport in Punta Delgada.Is this the correct form?https://covid19-azores.com/Thank youEdited: 4:34 am, August 13, 2020 "
This one for arrival and if you are staying only in one island https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl… This one is for inter-island flights https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/wp-content/upl…
"Was this on São Miguel or Terceira or another island? I keep reading the following on travel websites (but not on official Azores government documents):""2nd Option: Perform the screening test for the SARS-CoV-2, supported by collecting biological samples on arrival. The Health authority professionals at the airport will collect biological samples to conduct the SARS-CoV-2 test. After that, the visitor must remain in prophylactic isolation at the unit booked for staying until notification of the results can be informed. On São Miguel and Terceira islands, the maximum waiting time is 12 hours. On Santa Maria, Faial and Pico Island, the maximum waiting time is 48 hours.""So I'm wondering if it really does only take 12 hours to get the result on São Miguel, as I looked into it & every travel clinic in my country is booked within 3-4 days of our departure time, but we don't want to lose 48 hours of our trip since we can only go for a few days."
"I keep reading the following on travel websites (but not on official Azores government documents)- no one, not even official entities can assure any specific waiting time for the results. Even in the main islands (S. Miguel and Terceira), where the labs exist you can be sure that it will take ""only"" 12h. So DON'T plan anything based on that.On the other islands where the sample have to ""fly"" for the central labs to be proceeded, then it's ABSOLUTELY impossible to assure any timeline, all it takes for that not to be possible is a foggy day that will keep the plane grounded and the sample will not even reach the lab in 24h.Edited: 4:02 am, August 14, 2020 "
But am I correct in thinking you don't have to wait for the results of the 6 day test but can fly to another Island.Thanks
"But am I correct in thinking you don't have to wait for the results of the 6 day test - yes, it's been like that till now. As you know it can change quickly. Like the Azores government did for S. Miguel's clubs/nightlife bars a couple of days ago, now all closed again..."
"Hi, we just travelled to Sao Miguel from London yesterday. Heads up- the NHS tests are not accepted, even if you have filled out the survey prior to landing and received a QR code. Your Covid results need to be proven as PCR and be dated. We had to take the test at the airport and stay at our accommodations until we found out - about 15 hours later (overnight)."
"I was wondering if any one knew if you get tested upon arrival how long the results are taking? Hoping to hear the more people visiting the azores the more streamline the process might be becoming?Meant to be flying from the UK mid September, currently slightly unsure on what to do & if to travel."
"I was wondering if any one knew if you get tested upon arrival how long the results are taking? If you read the post before yours it says 15h. But if you arrive on a weekend it can be longer (some people reported it). Also on that post you can see that ""the NHS tests are not accepted, Your Covid results need to be proven as PCR and be dated."""
"Hi, I am travelling to the Azores from London on the 29th, I can do a covid test at a drive in (results in 24 hours) but I understand that the results will arrive in an email. Does anyone has any idea if this will be valid there? Thank you in advance."
"I can do a covid test at a drive in (results in 24 hours) but I understand that the results will arrive in an email - is it a PCR or a serology test? If it's a serology it will not be accepted. Does it say clearly your name, date and hour of the test, who's the lab and responsible person? Does it have a digital signature?"
"is it a PCR or a serology test? If it's a serology it will not be accepted. Does it say clearly your name, date and hour of the test, who's the lab and responsible person? Does it have a digital signature? - Yes it is a PCR test. The email does say clearly my name and date and hour of the test. I'm not sure about the digital signature."
"Regarding NHS tests please see comment 24.Edited: 7:01 pm, August 29, 2020 "
"We visited Sao Miguel 3 weeks ago. We did the PCR-RT test on arrival - it took only 20 minutes (waiting time, paper work, testing). The test was performed at 10 AM, the results were sent to us by email at 6 PM the same day.Then we needed to repeat the test on the 6th day of our stay - they called us a day before and asked to visit their drive-thru testing facility at 6 PM. Unfortunately, everybody was told to come at 6 PM, so there's a long line... The results of that second test were delivered to us ... 4 days later (fortunately you don't have to self-isolate while waiting)."
"I had a negative covid test from our NHS but I still had to have a test when I arrived, my 11 year old was exempt.If you can travel light, try and be first of the plane.Long queues or lines! We got our results at 9am the next morning.P.s arrived on 15th August till 22nd August.Edited: 2:59 pm, yesterday "
"Did anyone have trouble if their covid test was a little over the 72 hour mark? Also, are they being lenient on if the test was 72 hours from your trip's departure -- or does it have to be 72 hours upon arrival?"
"Did anyone have trouble if their covid test was a little over the 72 hour mark? Yes, there are reports of tests being refused based on what's the ""72h gap interpretation"", so if you can be on the safe side which is ""72 hours upon arrival"""
