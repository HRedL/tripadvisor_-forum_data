"All set for six nights at the Seven stars in the last week of April leaving May 2. First class air. Really special trip for us. Changed my travel agent to TurksandCaicosreservations.com. Val, by the way,is fantastic! First trip in years due to care of aging parents etc. Very excited but anyone else with concerns about the coronavirus? I realize it is nowhere near Europe or Asia, and have insurance, I would be devastated by a cancellation. Out of my control, but just figured I’d see If anyone else has similar concerns.Thanks!"
There are no reports there this far. I foresee it to be highly unlikely that you’d need to cancel your trip. Make sure you wash your hands often and don’t touch your face or mouth.. basically how everyday hygiene should be done! I wouldn’t sweat it. Just stay informed through government websites to see the status of a “possible” outbreak.
"We leave in a month with our kids and another family and although I am not scared of the virus itself, being quarantined or separated from my children or husband outside of the US scares the crap out of me. We have to cancel before Friday to get our hotel money back...If it were tomorrow, I would go; however, as fast as this is growing and as little as they know about it scares me even more. A woman in a travel tip group I am in was on the cruise ship and I can not imagine the nightmare they are all living right now...I am so torn because we were looking forward to this trip. It may get to the point they take everyones temperature before they get on and off the flight and with kids...you just know! AHH!"
We are a family of 5 departing in 15 days and I'm so scared that one of us is going to be sick while we're away!! I'm concerned the healthcare in Turks is not good. We've all been really looking forward to this trip for months and we will be very disappointed if it turns out badly. I hope we all have healthy fun trips!!
"rdm, not sure why you are scared, i have been to the clinics many times with various issues(colds, flu, strep, ear etc...), they are very good and not very expensive."
I totally get it! I am not as worried about getting sick as that can happen anywhere...I just can't imagine being stuck in our rooms without food or being quarantined outside of the US.
"mcd, oh yes that would be horrible, agree. No coronavirus here, that's why i will stay. All those planes coming in everyday, could be worrisome."
This isn't even something I can entertain. I will deal with it if I need to at the time. I would think that your airline would not allow travel to a place that has an issue.
Hmmm. Giving me food for thought. I doubt trip insurance would kick in unless one of *us* got it. Otherwise might be considered act of “god” if there’s an outbreak...
"Same for us. Our 27th anniversary trip to Turks and Caicos in mid-April (also first class) is very special and we've been planning it for a while. We also have insurance, but would hate to cancel. On the other hand, I suffer from a chronic autoimmune illness and don't want to take any chances.We have our masks, though I'm not sure how much protection they really offer."
I'm concerned because 2 of my children have auto-immune disorders and are more susceptible to getting this virus. My one child has also been around someone who has just returned from Italy!!! EEEEcccckkkk!
"Omg you guys, tough call, what do your doctors say?"
"The regular flu kills between 25,000 - 69,000 a year. If you are that worried about it, I think a phone call to your MD would be better than asking on a forum. Would it really matter what anyone here says?"
"Here are some stats of COVID-19 vs the flu. As you can see, you are MUCH MORE LIKELY to contract and die from the regular flu right now. If you aren't worried about the flu, you should not be worried about this. If we were talking about travel to one of the outbreak areas, that would be different. But we are talking about Turks & Caicos. COVID-19: Approximately 81,322 cases worldwide; 59 cases in the U.S. as of Feb. 26, 2020.Flu: Estimated 1 billion cases worldwide; 9.3 million to 45 million cases in the U.S. per year.COVID-19: Approximately 2,770 deaths reported worldwide; 0 deaths in the U.S., as of Feb. 26, 2020.Flu: 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide; 12,000 to 61,000 deaths in the U.S. per year.Edited: 1:01 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Also below, there have been no small child deaths. And the death rate is almost nonexistent for older children and even young adults. *Death Rate = (number of deaths / number of cases) = probability of dying if infected by the virus (%). This probability differs depending on the age group. The percentage shown below does NOT represent in any way the share of deaths by age group.

"emilys2222, thank you for the very useful information!"
"Yes but the death rate for corona 19 is higher. Overall rate of approx. 2% vs 0.1% for the flu. Flu deaths are much higher bc many more people have come down with it. Once corona 19 spreads and millions get it there will be more deaths. I mean, you could argue the flu is worse than Ebola bc there’s many more deaths. No, Ebola is way more deadly but it’s not nearly as widespread."
"Death numbers will go up, but the likelihood of any individual who contracts it dying should stay similar. More people contracting it doesn't mean the virus is more deadly to an individual person."
We are going to Antigua in 2 weeks. I’m concerned as well and am undecided if we should postpone our trip as well until September. I’m more concerned about not being allowed back in the United States if an outbreak suddenly occurs while we are away. Any input as well would be appreciated.
Does anyone know if the island is taking precautions? I’ve heard of some places in the Carribean restricting cruise ships or travelers from infected areas.
"Gunn, i have heard nothing except a form to fill out on the plane. What they do with the forms is anyones guess."
Thank you for your response and I will definitely follow your suggestions!
"If worried about need for medical evacuation from overseas get a DAN membership. Have one since 1992 when I lived and dove in Asia. Never needed to use it but it was always there ""just in case""."
"Wow, Ed, I just looked into DAN membership and it looks like an amazing deal. As far as I can tell, you do not have to be a certified diver to purchase this membership. Hmm...I think I will be getting the family membership; thanks for the tip!"
Going last week of April. I am high risk and could care less. If I get it I get it. It’s like the weather why should I worry about something I can’t control. Quarantines are useless this virus has been running wild for weeks in the USA. Take precaution with the elderly and just let it run it’s course with the others. This quarantine stuff is just prolonging the inevitable.
Just curious what you ended up doing? My wife and I are set to leave March 27th for 4 nights at Wymara in Turks Caicos. Obviously we have the same concerns as yourself. We are from Chicago area and things are getting crazy. My wife is also nervous about getting back
<< “My wife and I are set to leave March 27th ” >>Are you just not paying attention?
"This is for the Cayman Islands, not TCI, but I wouldn't be surprised if TCI follows their example:""The Owen Roberts International Airports and the Captain Charles Kirkconnell International Airport will be closed for international travel from March 22, 2020 at 11.59pm to April 22, 2020 at 11.59pm.""https:/…"
What does that mean?
">> What does that mean? >>The link? I don't know why TA shortened it so much, let me try again, it explains Cayman Island airport closures:https:/…The site is CaymanResident.comEdited: 2:40 pm, March 18, 2020 "
RPJ-NJ what the heck kind of response is that? Of course I'm paying attention. That's why I am on the site trying to gather information. If you cant offer useful information and stay on topic why even reply?
"Cardoc,I hate to disappoint you, we were booked to arrive on March 23rd, but when I learned that TCI closed its schools until April 20th (and that can always be extended), we postponed our trip. I've already made arrangements with our hotel, but can't get through to Delta. However, if you are flying Delta, United or American, I found this link to be helpful:https://www.dispatch.com/zz/news/20200310/de…Furthermore, the Cayman Islands just closed its airports to International travel, there's a good likelihood that TCI will follow suit:https:/…Good luck. Stay safe. They just opened drive-thru testing center by appointment near where I live on Long Island. Stop & Shop is opening its stores to only those over 60 from 6:00 AM - 7:30 AM. starting tomorrow. Yep, this totally sucks."
"<< ""That's why I am on the site trying to gather information."" >>Still on the fence?Assuming your cable TV and internet service is working, I won't jump on the bandwagon about curtailing virus spread, protecting yourself, protecting others, etc. That's apparently not working for a great many people. So be it.Instead, I'll appeal to baser instincts: You should cancel your trip now if you can. Why? Because -- forgetting that your trip will probably be cancelled by the governments of one or more countries -- your trip is going to suck. Really, really suck.Look at the forums for all the other islands; on a daily basis borders/airports are being closed, resorts shutting down, restaurants and bars ordered closed other than takeout. Many islands are instituting mandatory 14-day quarantine on arriving foreigners.If TCI doesn't put these measures in place, and you go, wherever you are staying will be a ghost town. You won't be able to buy/bring enough wipes to wipe down everything you're gonna touch. And, ultimately, you're going to spend every waking hour of your trip checking the internet for updates and worried the whole time about whether you'll be able to get home, and how, and when.That's not a vacation that I can see anyone being ""on the fence"" over.PS: for some context, my wife and daughter flew home from the DR yesterday... returning earlier than planned. When they flew down last week things sort of seemed to be an “Oh, that’s an ‘Italy’ problem” curiosity thing to us. That changed quickly... seemingly between the time their flight boarded in Newark and the time it landed in the Caribbean.Less than one week ago we were on the fence about whether they should go or cancel. Since that time the world went from ""Ah... what the heck!"" to ""Yo... what the f**k!""Can't wait to see what NEXT week brings!"
Just returned from Sandals Beaches Turks & Caicos March 14-21. Resort was almost vacant when we left. The Island doesn’t appear to have an issue yet and they are observing extreme caution but your biggest concern is the airlines! They can close down flights on a whim! Better check status both over and BACK carefully!!!
"Canceled our trip. Too much risk and don’t know if the airlines will even fly. Plus, I am at some risk I don’t want to be exposed in airports or in airplanes. Definitely will return. Thanks for all your answers."
"I read on an Instagram forum for T&C that they’re cancelling flights as of tomorrow, 3/24. I was not able to find this on a news outlet."
I am totally confused by United Airlines. I have tickets fro Chicago to Turks Caicos leaving this friday! And even after what the Turks Government posted they still haven't canceled my flight. I dont get it. Has anyone else experienced this? I mean I will obviously cancel myself tomorrow I just thought the airline would cancel if they couldn't fly in. Starnge...
Mostly everyone on this thread has cancelled their trips. If you’re coming from the US travelOutside of the country is strongly discouraged. It’s actually at a level 4. You may not get back into the country. Please read the threads. My hotel Sandals cancelled on us as they were temporarily closing ALL their Sandals locations. My personal opinion is to postpone your trip
No I totally am. You misunderstood me. Why hasn't United Airlines canceled my flight? Heck it still shows the flight is on schedule?
"Chris they are probably hoping that most people will take the free cancellation where they don't have to give a refund. If the flight gets shown as cancelled, then people could get a full refund."
"The airlines aren't responsible for people understanding a travel ban. There airlines and the government aren't connected. If you want to pay the money, not ask for a refund, and then obviously can't go... they win, you lose."
"Just saw this “ On March 20, 2020 the Premier has announced that all airports will be closed for all non-essential international and regional flights effective midnight Tuesday, March 24, 2020 for 21 days. Domestic, emergency, medivac, and courier flights are exempted. Seaports will be closed for international passenger travel but not cargo."
It is supposed to be a 3wk closure for Turks and Caicos. I did get an email from OCW giving a complimentary dinner for each guest who is traveling in April and May. I am supposed to travel in Mid May. I live in New York but at the opposite end of the state of NYC which is now considered the epicenter of this virus. They will not be able to keep the residents on lock-down indefinitely. Right now the death rate is at 1% in the US going by the people that have been tested and were found to be positive. This is not a containment. This is a control so as not to overload the hospitals. They want to flatten the curve and to span it out.
"We are seeing medical advances every day in dealing with this terrible virus. A new blood test which can detect antibodies for Covid-19 has just been developed. It should be mandatory for any airline (especially ones seeking government bailouts) to make sure every one of its passengers exhibits immunity before boarding a plane - to anywhere - domestic or international travel. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-…We currently have over 25,000 positives in NY, over 2,800 in my county alone. We have nearly half of all the coronavirus cases in the U.S.Edited: 8:05 am, March 25, 2020 "
"<< ""A new blood test... should be mandatory... before boarding a plane"" >>Sure. That sounds very practical.How many DAYS does it take to get the results back?It might be more practical for airlines to say that you must arrive at the airport 14 days prior to departure and quarantine everyone at the gate."
"RPJ-NJ,Well, I don't know how many hours or days it would take to get the results. This is brand new, breaking news. There is also talk of transfusions to provide people who don't have the antibodies to get them from those who do. I'm up for that. I probably don't have the antibodies as I have sheltered at home for 3 weeks now. Nobody likes mandatory anything, I get it. But if science provides us with a means to identify individuals who are immune and not carriers, I think we should implement its usage. Just show your blood test result on your phone before boarding. How would you know everyone you quarantine in the airport for 14 days are Covid free? Hmmm? I'll forgive your sarcasm. This time. :-)"
So the airline would start submitting medical claims to insurance companies? To do some sort if rapid test at the gate? Get ready to show up at least 10 hours early for your flight! :)
"In S. Korea, I believe they have some sort of alert system on their phones (ie: green light, red light) for everything Coronavirus related, I'm sure airlines could develop an app. https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/s…"
">> To do some sort if rapid test at the gate? >>No, what? Just like you have to get your passport in advance of your travel, you would have the test done enough days prior to your travel so that you could simply present the result at the gate."
""" you would have the test done enough days prior to your travel so that you could simply present the result at the gate.""Yeah right, and what stops you from getting infected in the days between you sending your test away until you show up at the airport ? SMH"
"<< ""what stops you from getting infected"" >>Not that I'm defending the nonsensical suggestion... but she was talking about an antibody test (showing you had come in contact with the virus and mounted and immune response) rather than a test to see if you are currently infected.As the suggestion is so patently asinine on its face, I won't get into why it makes no sense clinically."
"RJ, I didn't bother to read back in the thread, but to paraphrase what you said.., ya it ain't going to work.., : )"
"RJP-NJ,""Patently assinine""? Oh please, share with the group why only allowing IMMUNE travellers to board is something impossible to establish clinically. If someone tests immune, they're not going to contract the virus between the test results and boarding."
Let’s all be kind to one another. This is a time for togetherness not for petty arguments.
There's no such thing as immunity to any of the coronavirus strains. You can get them again and again.
"The logistics make it an asinine suggestion.Your lack of understanding of the difference between ""having antibodies"" and ""being immune"" notwithstanding.:-)"
Whether you can keep getting the corona virus once you have had it has yet to be determined.

"Yeah, you're right. Totally stupid to try and make sure folks are negative for Covid-19 when flying resumes. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Let's just welcome everyone back on board, especially from hot zones like NYC. How terribly obtrusive to insist on some sort of test. Whatever was I thinking?"
I found this interesting. https:/…
"Will ya look at this ... a 5 minute test that can be administered off site of a medical facility. Gosh, I can't possibly think of a use for this by the airlines, can you?https:/…399c045d6086"
"Premier in Turks & Caicos just announced that the airport will not open until July 22, 2020. Why is EXPEDIA (& maybe other travel companies) still selling vacation packages to the island to travel prior to then? Yes, they have a ""warning"" to check travel restrictions to the destination prior to booking, but WTF?!?"
"There may be a simple reason: Turks and Caicos Islands are not on the database used for monitoring territories worldwide, so the default is that TCI is open. This was the case when I called AA at the end of April to find out how they go about deciding if flights were operating (my flight was for June 8). The agent told me TCI was not in their database. It probably still is not."
