Just wondering if you need to provide a certificate or evidence of some kind to show that you have had the vaccinations for Goa?
Nothing required to be shown.However a few years ago if you sneezed or snuffled in the arrivals hall.....I believe you were dragged away!Bird flu scared the pants off them...lol
Thankyou!
And the swine flu epidemic 2 years ago where they had the heat sensors in the immigration hall to see if you had a temperature.
"Dont remind me Badgerlad, my daughter showed up bright orange on the scanner as she became illon the flight into Goa high temperature the works!! We got pulled over and I honestly thought that the OH would have to stay in quarantine with her for a week while I looked after the apartment!! Lol"
"When you think of everything we have to do to go on holiday, makes you wonder if its all worth while.OF COURSE IT IS ............;-~)Glad you volunteered the OH STALEX........;-) but glad it didnt come to that."
