"Hi, what is the current mesquito situation in Rio and Iguaza Falls? I read the summer is the peak season. Mostly around dusk? What about beaches in Rio?"
"It depends where you happen to be in Rio. The major infestations of mosquitoes are found in the favelas, where there is usually a lot of standing water, the perfect breeding grounds for the mosquito. Beach areas tend not to be a problem.Use DEET. Most insect repellents contain the chemical DEET, which remains the gold standard of currently available mosquito repellents.Wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, particularly at dusk.Sleep only in screened areasAir-conditioning may reduce mosquito infiltration. Where air-conditioning is not available, fans may be helpful. Mosquitoes appear to be reluctant to fly in windy air.Minimize skin exposure after dusk."
"on the urban beaches themselves you dont find mosquitos/similar creature... if you go around to beaches near heavily wooded areas (e.g. those in Ilha Grande, near Paraty, etc) then you have similar flying creatures that bite and draw your blood... worse in late afternoon, near waterfalls etc...as far as Rio itself... it is not only in favelas...I was there 3 weeks ago at a relative's place in Ipanema. no air conditioning in room I stayed, so window was open at night... I came home with literally dozens of mosquito bites on my legs, arms and every uncovered part of my body... it varies building by building... all it takes is one neighbor to be careless about mosquitos (letting water accummulate on plant pots etc) and then they breed quite fast in summer and fly around a certain range.... these were the regular ""Culex"" mosquitos which bite at night time only.the way more dangerous Aedes Aegypti, the one that transmits dengue, zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, tends to bite day time. these are indeed more likely to be found in areas with poor sanitation etc.tip: keep your lodging windows closed all day when you are out... and turn a/c on when you are there... mosquitoes do tend to have problems with flying around when a/c is on."
"Perfect, I won’t be visiting and favelas and won’t be in any non tourist spots with poor sanitation. I’m staying in a tourist hotel and I will make sure my window is closed at all times. I have many repellents with 100% Deet so I can use as needed."
Chikungunya cases up big in Rio state.https://bit.ly/2Kq3kky
"on my 6 visits to the Rio Zona Sul area , with visits to the Jardim Botanico area, Barra de Tijuca, and Lapa, I have not been bitten once ...it was always explained to me that the city goes around spraying anti-mosquito repellent at night in the tourist areas....that has been a major plus as far as I'm concerned (either that, or I've been incredibly lucky)....I did find quite a few more insects, including in my room, when I traveled to and visited the Buzios area."
"Study links a lack of basic sanitation systems to epidemics in Brazil.Last year 34.7 percent of the 5,570 municipalities reported cases of endemic or epidemic of diseases related to poor basic sanitation, such as dengue.https://bit.ly/2O1qO3S"
"Dengue cases in Brazil rise 149% in 2019:https://on.china.cn/2H9YCZ3Similar to zika and chikungunya, dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease, the symptoms of which include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash."
