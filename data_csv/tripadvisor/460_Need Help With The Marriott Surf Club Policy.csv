Can anyone send me a copy of the message that went to Marriott Surf Club Owners regarding the cancellation policy due to corona? I’ve book with and an owner and would love nothing more than to be in Aruba Sunday but....I have to College age sons that have to be moved out of the dorm this weekend. One is a senior and the other is a freshman. BOTH are devastated. The owner can rebank his week and resell it. I just need to be able to show him I am aware Marriott has offered this option to Owners.
Post it on one of the Surf Club fb pages. You’re more likely to get a response.I’m heading there in 14 days and hadn’t seen their policies.

I’m wondering the same thing. I don’t see in the Marriott policy that was posted that it mentions time shares specifically. I too rented at surf club through VRBO. The latest VRBO policy says they should refund 50% minimum. That’s what my owner sent me. But. I was wondering if the owner can bank their week then I should get a full refund.
Fredt3The info you posted is about BONVOY points. I believe the OP was interested in MARRIOTT VACATION Club( MVC) info

"Thank you for posting. So if I’m reading correctly, within 3-14 days, owners can deposit their week for future travel?"
Where did you find the info? I’ve done a google search and can’t find this info. I need a source before reaching out to the owner we rented from. Thanks for a quick reply.
I’m an owner
"We had to go as Marriott would not allow the cancellation and 3K was too much to lose. Of course we ended flying out early (left Wednesday, as opposed to Sunday). Other places kept guests informed Marriott Surf Club did nothing. Most places placed notes under guests doors. There were signs in the lobby about airlines. Marriott - nothing. It was by far, extremely ridiculous."
Thank you for posting Will :)
I can definitely say that I will never use VRBO again.
"I keep reading that Marriott did nothing. They have a history of that. I was in Puerto Rico a few years ago when the devastating hurricane was about to hit. We were staying at the St. Regis and they could not have been more helpful and informative. When we got to the airport ( on one of the last flights out), we were speaking with other passengers who stayed at the Marriott. Basically Marriott kicked them out abruptly with no explanation and no options of what to do."
Very disappointed in VRBO. Think I might try Flipkey.
This is the only information provided to owners regarding their cancellation policy changes due to COVID-19https:/…Individual Resort Updates are posted here:https://hub.vacationclub.com/resort-updates/
"I’m an owner and my friends now can’t go 6/29 check in. Because we are within the 60 days, I have to deposit into Interval International. I can only book thru Interval now vs with Marriott. This means I’m not guarantee since I can only book 4 months ahead (not 60 days. They made an exception). In addition, I’m almost sure not to be able to get back to my home resort thru Interval because priorities go to owners with points and weeks to use for that particular season. It’s unfortunate but I’m going to lose money here to refund back to my friend and then likely stuck not being able to book anything for where I really want to go because it’s now going to be thru Interval. This is from an owners perspective. FYI."
