"Concerning the Corona virus... What is your best guess that Bergamo Alta will remain open and entry will not restricted ? I read the restrictions made by Mayor Gori this morning, but so far he hasn't mentioned the upper town. We arrive March 4th and leave April 1st. We will be staying in Citta Alta the entire time. What other cities have been closed ? Thanks for any information or advice."

The survival rate for the corona virus is 98% which is higher than the rate for the flu!Donna
"Don't guess, be informed.Some official and verified sources of news here https:/…105699935"
"Yes I agree, but since I am not there now. I thought the forum might be a place where I someone might know, or have an idea about closures in Bergamo."
"Donna,According to CDC, 4.6 million flu cases have been diagnosed so far this year—up from 2.6 million in early December. This is a high number for so early in the season, but not yet at epidemic proportions. These flu cases have resulted in roughly 39,000 hospitalizations and 2,100 deaths from flu, according to CDC.Feb 12, 2020.That is a death rate of 0.045%, compared to the death rate of corona virus between 2 and 2.5%"
I was hoping to hear from someone who was actually in the city of Bergamo with information about the upper town.

"Up to know no restrictions on entering Bergamo. Should this happen I think it would apply not only to Città Alta but to the whole town.Museums, libraries, schools, universities and all events are closed. Bars close at 6.00p.m. Bye ☺"
Thank you Girella.
Update: the Duomo of Milan is open again.
The duomo in Milan in not reopened yet but will be open on MONDAY. https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/2…Can people please provide links to sources of information. To avoid passing rumours.
Sorry Dennis. That's what we were told on TV.Will be more exact next time.They will allow a limited number of visitors.However I think it's good news.
"Yes indeed, good news. Elsewhere GAC has reported that C della S article says maybe. I am a subscriber but still fighting their paywall, so had only the headline. Stay safe, healthy and happy there Girella. We plan to pass through visit Bergamo in September, four nights Provaglio d'Iseo, nine nights outside Mantova. If my typing goes wrong, it's because my fingers are crossed! :-)"
"""Stay safe, healthy and happy there Girella."" I'll do my best, thanks.We were due to go to Australia next week through Sri Lanka but we are cancelling it for fear of getting blocked somewhere on our way being Lombardi.We are very disappointed.Hope you'll be luckier.Edited: 4:59 pm, February 27, 2020 "

"Bergamo, Lombardy, is the epicentre of Coronavirus in Italy. It’s so sad for all those lovely people but I don’t think that any of us will be travelling anytime soon.Edited: 11:29 pm, March 25, 2020 "
"Hi Girella,How are you? I hope you’re safe and healthy. So sorry about beautiful Bergamo and sincerely hope this terrible ordeal will be over soon. Take care!Nora"
"I've thought of you Girella , and I am so happy to hear from you, and that you are well.Un abbraccio!VagabondaEdited: 10:00 am, March 26, 2020 "
"So good to know that you are doing fine, Girella! You have always been one of my favorite DEs on TA! Best of health to you and your family!My dearest Vagabonda, I am catching your posts on every thread and, as always, you are a voice of courage, decency, and common sense. It is so incredibly tough in Italy now, and now in Spain and in our neck of the woods, but we will survive and become stronger and wiser. With all my love!Nora"
"How is the situation in Lombardy with high death toll in Italy? Are people still safe and getting enough access to stores and goods? I'm in Austria and wondering how far the worst to be in near future. I'm hoping that the virus infection is not like someone just activating it in the apartments or a hotel by just checking-in. In Vienna, my hotel evicted me few weeks ago for the shutdown and I rented a location. Is there any total evacuation going on in the city?"
"This evening the lock down has been extended till 13th April.governo.it/it/…13968Food shops, pharmacies, telephone shops are open and little else. We must stay in our homes. No evacuation. The number of deaths is still high but stationary."
"Stay safe, Girella! Every day I am looking with bated breath at the Italy numbers and it seems to me that the number of daily new cases declined. Fingers crossed! We in the US are all in the same boat with Italy and Spain now. Nora"
Thanks Nora.Take care of yourselves. God willing we'll start travelling again soon.
