"With the spread of this corona virus , I just wanted to check what is the status at Netherlands ? Is there a restriction currently for any nationals visiting including from China ? We are scheduled to come from Singapore in the month of April , but not sure what’s the status out there ? Specially for the Keukenhof where the total tourists are expected to more than a million , is there any restriction envisaged that someone can update please"
Ofcourse there's no restriction for anyone. Just that Schengen visa are a lil bit harder to get for Chonese nationals.But please let's quit this ridiculous panic... So far Influenza has taken more victims this year. Will you not travel because of the yearly influenza outbreak?
"No , sorry I don’t mean to spread panic but rather wanted to understand if there is any restrictions being placed. Apparently Singapore is also on watch list and which made me concerned"
As long ad you've already got your Schengen visa there is nothing to worry about.
"Your reply is somewhat ignorant. The question wasn't about whether the person should worry but about restrictions. The situation is changing daily and should there by a bigger outbreak at a specific location then restriction WILL apply. My advice would be to follow Dutch news and world news in since we have no way of knowing at this time. People should be aware that they might find themselves ""trapped"" almost anywhere (hotel, airport etc) if a suspected outbreak occurs."
How would you know? The situation is changing daily and we have no way of knowing the next area to be affected and locked down. The intelligent advice is to monitor the news and travel advice and be prepared for delays or a lock down.
Thanks George. Yes this does seem to be changing with Italy in Europe reporting few casualties. Will continue to monitor the situation before boarding the flight to Amsterdam
"As it stands across Europe, apart from the restrictions on residents of some towns in Italy, there are no extra restrictions. France and Italy rejected the idea of suspending Schengen, but Austria is apparently looking at doing it on their border with Italy, and did temporarily suspend train travel between the two countries. As far as I know, that's it so far.As George says, just keep an eye on the European and Dutch news and see if anything changes."
There will be cases in the Netherlands soon enough. But difficult to predict what it will mean. If it is everywhere the need to quarantine will also get less.
">If it is everywhere the need to quarantine will also get less.<Not sure I understand. There will always be a quarantine at some level.""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness""--Mark Twain"
The financial markets are panicked and the CDC in the US is now getting into worry mode!So yes coronavirus will impact travel and that too pretty unpredictably!The right suggestion is to carefully monitor the news and be prepared for changing plans.
"Spain, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and France all reported coronavirus cases linked to an outbreak in Lombardy, Italy. Two European hotels are locked down as new cases spread across the Continent.Fingers crossed at the moment"
"You can be certain of 1 thing and that is that the virus will reach the Netherlands sooner or later, it’s just a matter of time."
"This virus spreading, it's not just going to stop (or be stopped) anywhere soon. What quarantine and other attempts at containment help with is slow things down which buys time to prepare, and also helps in not having too many cases at the same time which would put a lot of stress on healthcare systems. I don't like the thought but we should all be realistic and admit that this virus will continue spreading, and a severe impact on the public domain and travel/tourism in particular seems inevitable.Not to at least consider this when making travel plans for the coming months would be ignorant."
I fear that it will reach The Netherlands too. It has just reached NRW (one person) and that´s alonge the border to The Netherlands.Hopefully it will stop soon. But we can´t predict any upcoming situation.

Thinking this could stop is unrealistic wishful thinking unfortunately. That it undoubtedly will keep spreading is a safe prediction to make.
"Well, every year we have a flu epidemic and sometimes even a kind of flunami, with a huge number of deaths, because not all people are vaccinated.And every year it finishs around spring. So I hope that this new epidemic or even pandemic will stop as well, any time. But of course nobody knows..."
"A flunami (love the word!) happens every year causing deaths everywhere. Vaccination helps a bit, but due to the abundance of flu viruses floatong in the air and the vaccination onpy protecting against a few it's not fluproof.So far Corona hasn't shown a different pattern in killing people opposed to a normal flu. It's the old and weak and the young children who form the vast majority of the victims. Same as a normal flu. So far MERS (which is still raging at places) was a far more lethal virus killing a bit more indiscriminately. Corona seems to be a bit like SARS. It's not nice getting it, but the vast majority won't die of it.#tiredofscaremongersEdited: 8:44 am, February 26, 2020 "
"So True !Every year when Flu season starts, governments start panicking and (nearly) plan for sports such as Olympics to be cancelled. https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/coronavir…Or for the fact that since 2005, there have only been five global health emergencies declared by WHO. Watch the 3 minute video here.https://youtu.be/AYlzyQnSGD8Anyway - it is indeed still a bit early in Europe to panic. But schools have started preparing for shutdown etc. to prevent contagion. Maybe a bit of panic is good for keeping more people/children safe."
"Ah, ok so there's actually no reason why health authorities worldwide are trying to contain it. That's good to know. I still worry though about my flight getting cancelled and getting stuck in a foreign country where I don't want to be. Can you comfort me?"
"""Ah, ok so there's actually no reason why health authorities worldwide are trying to contain it. That's good to know.""People seem to be confusing steps taken on a macro public health policy level and the actual realistic statistical risk to any one specific individual.""I still worry though about my flight getting cancelled and getting stuck in a foreign country where I don't want to be.""This is a much bigger risk but is not a health risk per sé. We just returned from 3 of 4 planned weeks in SE Asia having flown with China Airlines via Taipei. We passed on the 4th week and returned early because of the unpredictability of flight disruptions and possible restrictions. So I get that one. I don't get the individual health panic like, ""Is it safe to travel to X?"" (with a very few exceptions) as if this was the eve of a virus-induced zombie apocalypse or bubonic plague."
"I agree with you, lennybruce, we shouldn´t become panic. But there is a small risk that any cities or towns will be put under quarantine or something like that just to avoid spreading this infect. And so people are worrying about their sustenance and their mobility, and not only about their health.As to me, I´m actually very relaxed...Edited: 5:22 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Actually the average flu death rate is around 0.1%. Only a small fraction of people contract flu as the rest are either vaccinated or have acquired immunity from past infections. In contrast, data from China shows a 4.0% mortality rate in Wuhan. There willl be no Covid-19 vaccine for months. Nobody has immunity.Edited: 5:32 am, February 27, 2020 "

"Mortality rate is low in areas where few people are infected but it shoots up in areas where it is higher, indeed peaking in Wuhan to about 4% where also the highest infection rates have been seen. This is associated with the quality of health care declining rapidly when getting flooded with patients. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30068-1/fulltextAs infections spread authorities will act aggressively attempting to keep the infection rate down to prevent the health systems having to deal with too many patients. There doesn't seem too much to worry about this moment in Western countries from a health perspective. Measures preventing mass gatherings of people will have a serious impact though on public life, travel and tourism. Downplaying this is just ignorant."
"True the influenza has caused more deaths but the mortality rate for those that contract the coronavirus is much higher. We have booked a trip in Sept to Amsterdam, Munich, Vienna and Prague and have no plans to cancel but will monitor the situation closely as time goes on. https:/…"
"It was only matter of time before a case showed up. So we have a confirmed case in Tilburg now.https:/…The NL is densely packed with people who are very mobile. So it’s very easy for one individual to interact with a few hundred others a week. In trains, trams, elevators, supermarkets, restaurants, offices, museums and on roads. Moreover a lot of people travel continuously to other countries on trips.So we need to be extremely extremely lucky to not have a lot of cases soon. The statistics experts here can come back and give us some more analysis at that time! At what confidence interval level we need to worry or not !Luckily the Gilead”s vaccine being tested in China and in the US can come to the rescue soon ( I am not biologist but am following that development ) ! Yet it is almost two to three months of trouble ahead in my opinion!Edited: 12:35 am, February 28, 2020 "
"The patient is being treated in a hospital in Tilburg, but he lives in the small town of Loon op Zand. He recently came back from the region in the north of Italy where there is an outbreak of the virus. So it’s very likely that he got infected with the virus there. This means there are still no cases of people who contracted the virus within the Netherlands. But this will likely only be a matter of time."
"Yes , the way its spreading it will be no surprise that soon there will be many more cases in Amsterdam. Another issue is that since its a schengen visa, one can travel into any of those countries by coming at a port which is allowing visitors to come from a particular entry. The borders in these countries including NL are porous. Its very difficult to prevent anyone entering unless the whole Block decides unanimously to ban tourists from affected countries.Am gutted. I had planned and dreamt to be there at Keukenhof this spring in mid April. Unfortunately its looking bleak but not losing hope."
“ many more cases in Amsterdam.“Many more cases in Amsterdam? Many more? Please stick to the facts. Currently there are NO cases in Amsterdam. There is 1 (one) confirmed case in the south of the Netherlands. That’s it.Also I’m not sure what a Schengen visa has to do with this. The person that contracted the virus is a Dutch national. He didn’t need a visa to travel to Italy where he likely got the virus.
"Just as I typed my previous message, it seems there now is 1 case in the Amsterdam area. An inhabitant of Diemen travelled to the infected region in Italy and has now been diagnosed to have the virus. She is not hospitalized, but is staying in quarantine in her home."
"Breda, I find your suggestions very useful but sorry to add that at times you are being very curt. I just mentioned that it may not be surprising for many more cases because of the way this virus has spread in general across the globe. And I will try explain what I meant by Schengen visa. For eg some tourist who has a Shengen visa need not enter Amsterdam directly at Schipol. The tourist could come thru Austria or France or any other Schengen state which may be difficult to curtail even if NL wishes. I respectfully acknowledge that you surely have more local knowledge and you have great suggestions to share on forum as well, but it wont be bad to be not sarcastic or curt."
"Schengen has little to do with any potential spread, and suspending Schengen will have no real effect. The UK isn't in Schengen and has something like 20 cases, most from people who had travelled to China. Short of the whole world becoming North Korea-like, visas and borders can't do much. Talk of closing them is just PR.If it spreads the same way as flu (which is actually not certain, but let's say it does), then imagine somebody infected travels from Singapore to London. She has a coffee at Heathrow, coughs, and leaves the virus on the table. Kees from Amsterdam is heading home and sits at that table next. He arrives back in Amsterdam and goes to a restaurant the next day, where he passes it on to Henk from Rotterdam, who's in Amsterdam for the day. Now it's in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and Schengen didn't come into it."
Well factually now Amsterdam has a patient !https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/tweede-patient-in…
ilas65 : I get your point. This can be spread by anyone and could be from any country now. I get the prespective. Thanks
"@Nawal; I was not being sarcastic. You stated that there will be many more cases in Amsterdam which implied there were already cases in Amsterdam. As I already stated in post 31 there currently is one patient in the Amsterdam area. This patient has travelled to the infected region in Italy, so it’s likely she got the virus there. This means that there are still no cases where people contracted the virus within the Netherlands. There is a lot of false information out there about this virus. I hope that at least on this forum we can stick to the facts and not create unnecessary panic."
"Many years ago, doing statistics at University, we did some theoretical stuff on the spread of diseases. If I remember the names right, Kees from Amsterdam, Anne from London, Ramon from Rio, Raj from Delhi and Jane from NYC have got an awful lot to answer for."

"One person in Amsterdam has corona virus but how many currently have the flu? I have a river cruise planned in April and unless the flight or cruise is cancelled I will be there.  A few years I was on a river cruise where at least half of the people were sick with flu, coughs. At every stop a dr came on board to treat someone."
"Pedantically, Diemen is a separate municipality from Amsterdam.."
The woman that got the virus lives and works in a hospital Amsterdam. Due to her house in Amsterdam being renovated she is now in quarantine in the house of family members in Diemen.

I was just being silly for no real reason.
Meant to write “lives in Amsterdam and works in an Amsterdam hospital”
"Just a hint: at least in Germany there are a lot of fake news on Whatsapp, Facebook ASO, concerning number and destination of infected persons, conspiracy theories (and silly remedies). So travellers should monitor reliable medias and/or ask at competent authorities to get news about the current situation in any destination.´Edited: 2:51 pm, February 28, 2020 "

"Never realised that when I posted this original question more than a month back , this could become so serious and now the epicentre seems to have been shifted from China to Europe. On Fb I see that the opening of the Khof gardens has been postponed to end of Month. It’s a pity that the trip will have to be called off"
Nawal. Stay safe. It’s good that everyone in India is also panicking so the spread maybe limited.When on Feb 25 I wrote to you here that we need to panic many of the people posting started making fun and jokes.I wish them and everyone else good health and safe stay during the next three weeks which are the most dangerous one. Fingers crossed we will all come out ok!
"Pretty interesting to read back the first pages of this topic.What for some was the inevitable course of events leading to where we are now, for others was beyond imagination.So what seems to be the inevitable course of events from where we are right now? This is not going to go away anywhere soon, and it's probably going to get a lot less nice in the coming week(s) before stabilising and then getting better again. Restrictions will not go away in a few weeks. Not just March, but probably April too can be completely written off for the tourist industry."
>> So what seems to be the inevitable course of events from where we are right now? <<Now that people are more woke ( is that the new generation term ) and maintaining some degree of social distance And that heat is returning soonAnd possible treatments are ever so closeWe need to hang on for three to four weeks!Then things will start returning to somewhat normal !!Daniel Craig has already moved from Martini to Heineken 0.0%We will change our lifestyle !!

"Thanks KK_NL1. I am based out of Singapore. Here they had started restriction on entry from China and gradually it extended to South Korea and many other countries . In fact probably it’s best controlled out here in Singapore . When I asked this question in Feb , probably this virus was yet to reach Europe. And now all of a sudden Europe seems to be the epicentre. It’s such a pity that most of the tourism that starts with advent of spring until fall may get impacted . Am still hoping that situation improves to prevent a complete lock down the way Italy has doneEdited: 2:01 am, March 15, 2020 "
"The lockdown in Spain and measures tightened in France, Belgium etc. point to the near term pain getting worse from work, travel etc. points of views.Singapore indeed had made extraordinary efforts from the day-1 along with Taiwan etc. to contain the spread and now everyone is praising the outcome.Quite a contrast is the UK, where the plan is to let 70% of population be infected. If you have time read this article:https://eand.co/why-britains-coronavirus-str…Anyway, in genuine good news, some real antibodies to Covid-19 have been identified and it may not be a distant future when a treatment is possible. The doctors have anyway been using HIV medications which has had some benefits."
Remdesivir has been started (test) on Covid-19 in a patient in Washington state. I got my info from another source but you can read it on wiki. I hope it works since it worked on SARS and MERS
"Remdesivir was developed for Ebola treatment and was unsuccessful. Gilead also tested on some other viral diseases. This time, China started using this and now some patients are indeed being tested. Hopefully that would work out!That is one of the several experiments going on. There are two other pharma products which are very promising. Again drugs for something else, which can help here.But finding the right antibody for this specific virus is the Breakthrough and even as it may take a bit of time, that would be a real solution."
