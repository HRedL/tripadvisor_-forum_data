"Last week Governor Steve Sisolak announced that bars that don’t serve food must revert back to Phase 1 guidelines. This was due to the rise in cases of COVID-19 in Nevada.On social media, many didn’t see that executive order coming. What some were expecting was another shutdown of the Strip. Right after the resorts reopened in early June, videos of unmasked crowds in casinos and pools flooded the Internet -- followed by rumors that certain properties would close up to avoid endangering their employees -- and the bad PR of an outbreak.

"Your other thread is back. But it’s in the weird limbo that happens sometimes. “ Open” again but not showing up unless you search for it.Sometimes if the original poster of the thread posts to it, that solves the issue .https:/…107234655"
"Very likely, but only guessing.Hunt"
It's a distinct probability...
"It will shut down again but only because it will have no customers, we'll all be in bed with coronavirus."
"There will be few customers willing to go and few employees available to work. When the casinos shut down again, it'll be for a long time. Some may never open again."
">>>There will be few customers willing to go and few employees available to work. When the casinos shut down again, it'll be for a long time. Some may never open again.<<<Weekends are very busy. Employees are ready and willing to go to work.Who is the ""some"" that say the casinos will never open again? Pure internet garbage statement.I have been on the Strip, Downtown, ""locals"" casinos, etc. 99% are in full compliance, from what I have seen. If you want to see over 40 photos of it, go to my website. Link is on my TA Profile Page. I have been taking photos since the bar shutdown. Actually, since the first shutdown.What casinos will not reopen? Gov. Sisolak can close things down again if he chooses."
"Your govt seems as mixed up as the UK's. We have been asked to start getting out and about again, to use our shops, restaurants, bars and help get the economy moving. We have gone from a thousand deaths aday being announced to around 20. Yet today, we will be told it is now going to be mandatory to wear masks when in shops and supermarkets, bars and restaurants., casinos and cinemas.Large numbers of people are already saying if this is the case, they'll not be visting such places. I see a similar situation in Vegas. When some thing becomes so much trouble, people think why bother ? So much for returning to normal. Vegas relies on a constant massive footfall through out the year to kep its economy on track. It will not need to be shut down by govt, it will simply give up of its own accord as people vote with their feet."
"Yes, it wil close by august 1st at 7 am."
Chicken Little is a busy little booger these days!
"@ 7 The reason masks are required as things open up is precisely why things are able to open up. As we mingle with more people, it is even more important to protect ourselves and them. Things aren't opening because the virus has gone away, they are opening up in spite of the virus still being active. We all still have to be diligent."
"California governor Newsom promised on TV that he will never shut down California again, he just did yesterday. First time was bad and lasted 3 months. Never say never."
"ed because of NY’s coronavirus restrictionsJon CampbellFWIW..Just a comparable situation re NYS casinos....New York State Team USA TODAY NETWORKALBANY – More than 4,100 casino workers across New York will receive layoff notices this week while the facilities remained shuttered because of the state’s COVID- 19 restrictions.Employees at Tioga Downs, Vernon Downs, Rivers Casino Resorts World Catskills and Resorts World New York City all are slated to receive the notices, according to the casino owners."
"Native American casinos, meanwhile, are not required to follow the state’s shutdown orders.Turning Stone and other Oneida Nation casinos reopened June 10, while the Seneca Nation reopened their western New York casinos in June and early July with mandatory face masks and temperature checks.

Highly doubt it - at least on Covid grounds.I don’t know the business scenario at present but it can’t be good especially during the week. It’s going to be a long haul.
"Looking at some of the numbers, the situation appears to be under control. The hospitalizations and ICU availability have stabilized, likewise the infection rate is steady.With bars closed additional to mandatory mask wearing, the visitor numbers will decrease and improve social distancing.Unless there are hotel/casino staff availability issues due to COVID-19, I see continued business."
"""under control""Yesterday posted the highest number of cases ever, and 40% over last week's average."
"@ Tom....cases are different than hospitalizations and deaths. People are having to get tested before going forward with any surgical procedure-even elective, thus an increase in testing.Edited: 1:44 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"#6...> Who is the ""some"" that say the casinos will never open again? Pure internet garbage statement.Your reading comprehension isn't very good. I'm the one who says that some casinos may never reopen. Duh!If things get shutdown again, it will be for a long time, because the virus is out of control. It's very expensive to own a big casino without revenue, even if you're not paying most employee wages. Rent and mortgage are very expensive. During the recession 10 years ago, casinos had a rough go of it -- and that was with some revenue. But the current situation is likely to be a depression much worse than the recession. The Caranos of Reno just bought Caesars for 17 billion. They already planned on selling some off, but now they might be faced with selling more off at fire sale prices. When the pandemic is behind us, people may not have money for travel or gambling. Without lots of tourism, Las Vegas is a hot and difficult place to make it.> I have been on the Strip, Downtown, ""locals"" casinos, etc. 99% are in full compliance, from what I have seen.Yet people are still getting sick. Because wearing face masks and distancing isn't enough when everybody is inside a building with the air being circulated among them. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. HVAC spreads it like wildfire. Perhaps if the casinos opened outdoor gambling pavilions with heavy duty fans for extra ventilation, it would be safe -- though it'd have to wait until the fall, when the heat dies down. But having everybody inside for long periods of time, wearing cloth masks instead of N-95, sharing second hand smoke, and touching the same machines without real disinfection in between players, is a recipe for disaster, as is now happening all over the country, including in Las Vegas. And if you don't think it's bad now, just wait a few weeks.>Weekends are very busy. Employees are ready and willing to go to work.I'm sure for every employee chomping at the bit to get back to work, there are few who are rightly terrified of it. With casinos hiding non-HIPAA statistics (i. e. -- stats that don't compromise medical confidentiality, like how many COVID-19 cases they know about among their employee), both workers and guests have plenty to be concerned about.You get so angry whenever someone points out possible negative outcomes from all of this. It's a disease. Don't take it personally."
"#17...> @ Tom....cases are different than hospitalizations and deaths. People are having to get tested before going forward with any surgical procedure-even elective, thus an increase in testing.Hospital ICUs are full in many metro areas across the country. It's a triage situation in which some people are denied care because there aren't enough beds and doctors for them. It's an especially bad time to be old and in need of hospitalization.As for elective surgeries, because of the pressing need to care for COVID and non-elective surgery patients, they simply aren't happening in most hospitals now.You seem to think that because there's an increase in testing, new positive results are nothing to be concerned with. Nothing could be further from the truth. We need much more testing to find out where we stand. As more testing happens, we're finding out that we're in deep trouble. Yet people like you, spewing republican talking points suggesting that there's nothing to worry about, are leading the way to even deeper trouble. Stop it."
The governor will not shut them down again. The only way is if there are no customers. I was shocked to see how many people wanted to risk going to Vegas for a 20% Vegas experience. I was wrong about that so I expect people will still be going to Vegas Lite. So no more shut downs.
Why is the govt mixed up ..pretty straightforward if u ope up and social distancing is harder then u wear a covering ..not rocker science is it ..doh
"The California Gaming Association has asked the governor to shut down all casinos. ""Either we're all in this together or we're not"". https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/co…"
Last I checked Las Vegas isn't in California.Fortunately.
#23 not sure what point you are trying to make ?
"If we can just get our change back into circulation, everything will be A-OK."
You had to check if LV was in CA or not? Smh.
I’ve had diarrhea for three days straight. I’m going to Las Vegas now.
Diarrhea is now considered one of the warnings for covid.
I hope if I ever catch Covid 19 the diarrhoea symptom is accompanied by the loss of smell symptom.
Spoken like a true liberal. If your opinion isn't the same as mine then you don't get to have an opinion. Stop it!

"""Where is the spike"" The spike is in florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina............... Two and three times the number of cases this week compared to a month ago"
"So far, it goes to show that people are not following guidelines and have little self control. Cases are going up exponentially and the amount of visitors to Vegas is so small that opening is a waste. So might as well have another shut down once and for all until the pandemic is under control"
@ Tom....Florida already has recent news that their positivity reports are way off. I wouldn't be surprised if other states have errors as well. https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-u…Deaths not keeping pace with rising positive numbers: https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-charles-loc…
"Perpetual bug...the only numbers that matter are hospitalization rates and ICU capacity rates...positive results while important, not nearly as important as the other 2..negative results are meaningless, as they are a snapshot of that particular moment..you,could be positive shortly thereafter"
"It may as well shut down. No conventions, no international travelers, few people flying in. I guess, until things open up, Vegas will be Atlantic City west, a regional destination for southern California. I fear the new normal may never be like the old normal, at least not in my lifetime. So much for the golden years."
"Qdog...correct, and death rates. All of which are not spiking. The only thing spiking is positive cases which is why I posted what I did."

"""Qdog...correct, and death rates. All of which are not spiking. The only thing spiking is positive cases which is why I posted what I did.""No it isn't because of the number of cases that we are going through all this. It is the number of those in the hospital. And this is up everywhere. It's the one problem they can't handle, and playing with the other numbers doesn't matter much. Everyone has to worry that there aren't enough beds for those who need them, and we have to try to keep the healthcare system from being overwhelmed."

I will always accept money except when I don't feel I deserve it.

Unfortunately when the swamp was drained only the raw sewage was left....and that ain't good.

I assume you don't think that his base will blame him for that as they didn't when he bragged about grabbing all those teenage vaginas.

"I really don't see how there's any other option at this point. Masks and distancing are effective mitigating factors to keep low case counts low. But right now it's a full outbreak.
