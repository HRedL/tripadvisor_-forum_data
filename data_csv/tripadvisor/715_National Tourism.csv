Have buses from Oaxaca etc been permitted to come into Huatulco yet ?
No tourists are allowed into HUX at present.
June 15 the beaches and related services will start reopening. 30% of services will open as will hotels at 30% capacity. Masks an distancing will be required. Primarily for regional tourists and locals at this time.
"I hope that ""regional tourists"" does not include those from Oaxaca City. COVID-19 is a major problem there right now. ."
"We have received at least one report by a hotel owner that there may be a delay in reopening (even at 30% capacity) due to COVID-19 we cases continuing to increase in Huatulco. To be continued.....Stay safe. Be well.CHEdited: 10:43 am, June 12, 2020 "
Thanks for the updates CH. Any info about Zipolite?Gracias
"Terry, We believe Zipolite is in Pochutla’s jurisdiction and subject to those health mandates. So far, Pochutla and Huatulco have been in lock-step with how COVID-19 and tourism are being handled. Time will tell.CH"
Muchísimas gracias CH. Quidense mucho. Terry
