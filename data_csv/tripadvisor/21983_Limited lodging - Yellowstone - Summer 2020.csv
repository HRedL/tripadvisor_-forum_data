"Thanks for the post, this clarifies questions from several ongoing threads.This makes sense. I'm gald to see realistic, rational expectations."
"Interesting that Roosevelt will not open at all. I wonder if the Slough Creek or Pebble Creek campgrounds will open.We used to stay at Roosevelt each year for over 15 years, but moved on when the cost increased by 4x. Glad our reservation is in Silver Gate.Will miss a dinner or two at Roosevelt and, of course, the porch."
Darn! We have reservations at both Roosevelt and OFI for early September. Time to figure out alternatives before the limited lodging fills up!
"""I wonder if the Slough Creek or Pebble Creek campgrounds will open.""No. See post #2"
"""Time to figure out alternatives before the limited lodging fills up!""Personally, I'd book in a gateway city.Xanterra will be in business next year. They have a 20 year contract.A lot of the small business owners in the gateway cities may not. Some are >thisclose< to losing their business as well as their homes during this pandemic."

"So if I follow that posting on the YNP site....if I currently have plans to stay at a VRBO in West Y'stone from July 4-7, I should be good to access park and normal facilities, just can't plan for a sit-down dinner in the park?But also that local restaurants, stores, etc should be open in West Yellowstone and/or Gardiner (maybe that's just implied now??)And I assume all of this is contingent on UT (fly into SLC), ID, MT and WY lifting the quarantine rules?"
"Paragraph 1 = I'd say ""yes""Paragraph 2 = Yes, even if it's curbside service and not in-restaurant diningParagraph 3 = They can't open the national parks if the 14 day quarantine is still in effect in mid-June"
"Post #2 does not address the park run, FCFS campgrounds. Slough and Pebble Creek are not Xanterra properties. No information on those that I have seen yet."
"Oops! Ran out of time to edit -wafrye7, I got the paragraphs mixed up. Yes, to access to the park with modifications. They are still deciding what to do with visitor centers, etc. The physical ""sights"" never close, but they will have to manage humans who want to see them.Food / restaurants are one of the best reasons to stay in a gateway city this year. They need your business. You'll have variety.As far as your flights? No one knows right now. Good luck! I'm driving out!"
Just swapped out my Roosevelt 2 nights for Mammoth cabin while there was still availability. Silver Tip was booked.

Xanterra does NOT run those two campgrounds. The park service does. They do not take reservations. No information on them as yet.
Be careful to know cancellation policies for outside the park lodging.
"Good advice. I was able to book 2 nights in the Tetons, but the website said 3 night minimum. To be sure, I called to talk to the manager to confirm their rules, pet policy and cancellation policies. IME, hotels all over the country are offering very generous cancellation policies due to the unknowns that booking a trip in Covid 19 days brings.In the case of my booking, it was a 7 day policy which is VERY fair.Edited: 6:07 pm, April 23, 2020 "

"Sounds like a great trip!I visited the Grizzly and Wolf center a few falls ago and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. In January, I went on a winter tour and ""we"" (about 16 of us in two vans) visited the center before we left WY. I could tell no one was really excited about it. ALL really enjoyed it. It was fun just watching the wolves' interactions for almost an hour. Also great to get good photos. Enjoyed seeing the grizzlies, who are released to the viewing area one at a time. Great that the ones who are there for varied reasons have a new chance at life. In summer, they let chosen kids hide ""treats"" in the area and it's fun to watch the bear forage for them. They've added a wonderful otter building and exhibit since I was there the first time and it was VERY well done. Loved the birds too. Double check, but at one time your ticket was also good for the next day so you could visit in the afternoon and return the next morning. I do recommend it! The small interactive museum is very well done and the gift shop is small but has nice items. I bought my only souvenir of the trip there.https:/…Yes! Tickets are good for two consecutive days - great for fitting in before or after visits to the park.Edited: 7:20 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"Thank you all for being on top of this! I called and had completely changed our lodging by dinner time, and the official email from Xanterra about the cancellations didn't come until 8:30pm. We're visiting in early Sept, originally had 3 nights Signal Mt Lodge (so far, haven't heard anything about their lodging), 2 nights Roosevelt, 1 night Cody (so far no word), 2 nights Canyon Lodge, 2 nights OFI, and 1 night Antler Inn prior to our early flight home. I managed to get 2 nights in Silver Gate to replace Rosy. And I managed to get 4 nights in a Western Cabin at Canyon to replace our 2 nights Canyon Lodge and 2 nights OFI. I'm not positive I want 4 nights at Canyon, may switch the last night to West Yellowstone. But I figured I'd grab all 4 nights since they were available. This will be our 4th trip, so while we're disappointed at the change in plans, we'll go with the flow and make the best of it. We've never stayed in the Cabins at Canyon, so that will be new and exciting. But we'll really miss the OFI and that magnificent lobby. There's always next year!Thank you all! This forum and you experts are the best!Amy"
"Thank you onemoreroad! Yeah, I'm not crazy about the idea of flying w/7 of us....but driving isn't an option. I do feel for all the property owners, restaurants, service providers, etc tehre….such a limited season to make the year, and now that is going to be hosed.I'll have a bunch of college age guys though, that will want to support the local restaurants by eating a lot after a day in the park (hopefully away from people)."
I need some clarification please. Does this include the standard lodge rooms at Canyon?
"If you have a reservation for a cabin with a private bath at Canyon, you're fine.If you have a reservation for anything else, no.They are not opening lodges in the park this year for guests/ visitors. They may use them for employee housing in order to meet the social distancing guidelines.Look for alternatives in the gateway towns - Cooke City/ Silver Gate, Gardiner, West Yellowstone or even Cody."
We have reservations at Mammoth in cabin (without bath). Am I understanding that the cabins are still open or only the ones with private baths? Also - will the Inns be open to walk around in the lobbies or are they going to be completely shut down?
What a disappointment to receive the notice that my lodging reservations will be cancelled. I was hoping that the summer would offer some kind of reprieve from home confinement -- and some opportunity for small businesses to resume operations. I hope that the businesses in the Yellowstone area will survive losing an entire summer season.
"Wow, a lot has developed since I last checked yesterday. Thank you for this thread.I had gone ahead and booked 4 nights in West Yellowstone to replace days I had wanted for OF and Canyon. Now I see Canyon is available those 4 days but I'm just going to book 2 days. If nothing else, I'll have 2 days with in park lodging.I have 1 night Cooke City, 1 night GardinerI have my 3 nights at Signal Mountain. 1 night Dornan'sNow if they start closing off access to certain areas of the park (Yellowstone), then I will have to rethink this trip."
"Teresa W, you should get an e-mail. Shared bath will not be available. You can look and see if one with bath is available for your nights, or look at Gardiner or Cooke City, just be aware of cancellation policies for out-of-park lodging. No walking around inside, the Inn will be closed."
"Well, this is the nail in the coffin of our trip. I spent so many hours pouring over Trip Advisor for planning, so I want to say a big thank you to all of you YNP experts who provide so much help to those of us who have never been. Fingers crossed for 2021."
"AmyK, sorry about your trip. At least no research is wasted. You'll have it ready to go for next year. Do be aware that the reservation date for 2021 has been changed to June 1 and they say they are going to open the lines at 2A MDT. Yes, 2A. Xanterra has changed so much stuff in the last week that I'd think this may be changed a couple of times before June 1 as well, so check in the week before to make sure this is still good information.MartyK, I'd go with 2 nights West Yellowstone (as a replacement for your OF nights) and 2 Canyon if they are still available. You are right...the ground is shifting almost hourly and it's not because the Yellowstone Caldera is ready to blow, lol!!Pam"
"amyk, hope you are able to make a 2021 trip happen."
"For the folks switching to Canyon, remember that the road over Dunraven pass to Tower/Roosevelt will be closed all summer."
"Thank you for your reply. Definitely a huge disappointment to not be able to see Old Faithful Inn. We do have camping reservations in Grant Village for 7 nights, but now trying to determine if it's going to be worth it to make the trek across the country and have limited opportunities...OR could it possibly be better with less crowds??"
"This is what I am trying to determine....do we come across the country with limited opportunities and possibly smaller crowds, or cancel and be able to see everything next summer. I am leaning more towards canceling at this time because I feel like we will miss too many things like staying at OFI."
"Honestly, if you are fine with coming next year, I'd wait until next year and hope everything is back to normal.All of the natural ""sights"" will still be there this year but park authority will have to determine how to manage human traffic, especially on the thermal boardwalks. My biggest concern would be Grand Prismatic, because it's already ""too narrow"" (IMO) and there's no room to get away from others. There are a few ""landing"" kind of areas, where you can stand to the side and let others pass, but other than that...I just think rangers are going to have to limit how many people are on the boardwalk at a given time. Which is not a bad idea even when things are back to ""normal"". I hate crowded boardwalks.I was there this January and it was SO nice to just have a few people on the boardwalks at a given time. I thought September was nice! Winter reminds me of Yellowstone visits back in the early 80s. On some mornings, there were only a handful in sight range at Midway.It was also hard to be at the Old Faithful area and not be able to ""visit"" my old friend, the lobby of the OFI. But no, I would not cancel a trip because I could not go into the Old Faithful Inn.You'll be able to get to all of the famous landmarks. Managing how many people are in a viewing area at a time will probably be in place."
"Thanks for the tip, Pam! I will check back in for changes to the reservation date. I may even be rearranging my trip to make it better based on all the things I've learned since May 1 2019."
Are you under the assumption that dispersed camping and any entrance into the park will not be allowed until June 15?Thank you!
"Kyle E , Welcome to the fourm!Yellowstone National Park opening has not been set, it is wait and see at this time. Everything is closed for now. Right now both Montana and Wyoming have a 14 day quarantine for outside visitors. When that changes is unknown as well. There is no dispersed camping in Yellowstone, at any time."
"""Are you under the assumption that dispersed camping and any entrance into the park will not be allowed until June 15?""This is an unknown. There have been some interviews with Superintendent Cam Sholly where he indicates the possibility of a ""soft"" opening of the park around June 1 before any services open. Montana has started opening their state on a limited basis today so I am guessing part of the equation will be whether they see an increase in cases and have to shut back down.I think this is a wait and see situation. I have no insider knowledge, lol. PamEdited: 5:07 pm, April 24, 2020 "
">>>Montana has started opening their state on a limited basis today so I am guessing part of the equation will be whether they see an increase in cases and have to shut back down.<<<To add on to this, Montana has a 14 day self-quarantine order for any person coming into the state for purposes other than work (or driving through the state to get to another state). While we are starting Phase 1 of the three phase reopening plan tomorrow and some restrictions are being lifted in a very limited and controlled manner, out governor has been very adamant that the 14 day self-quarantine will remain in effect for the entire three phases of the reopening. He has also been very adamant that while it is hopeful that each state will be approximately 2 weeks, there is no set time parameters for each phase. Our numbers are the lowest in the country and he does not want people from other areas bringing the virus back in in large numbers. Also, in interviews with Yellowstone Park Superintendent Sholly, he has always stressed that the park will probably open in stages. He has also stressed that Yellowstone Park sits in three states and multiple counties. He has to work with each state and each county to come up with a plan that works for everyone. That task alone, is mind-boggling as each state is in a completely different point in this pandemic.Deb"
"Thanks for your reply! Good to know there is never dispersed camping in Yellowstone. Living in Arizona I’m hopeful the Grand Canyon or the big 5 in Utah will open up soon. To me it would make sense for dispersed camping to exist as soon as the parks allow any sort of entrance, but only time will tell.Thanks again!Edited: 5:35 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"They won't suddenly allow dispersed camping if it was not allowed before. Most National Parks will not have dispersed camping. Dispersed camping is not allowed in Grand Canyon National Park either. Be sure you do your research. There are forums for Utah and Arizona. Always start with the national park website first, then ask if you have questions. Everyone likes helping with planning, but your do need to do you part as well.Edited: 5:41 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Thank you so much for the information about the phased reopening of Montana. It is really helpful in trying to decide what to do. Especially, as we are looking at renting a house now. I don’t want to give up on our trip just yet. But I’m concerned."
"I’ve never researched Yellowstone just found this forum in searching for national park updates, and also understanding which states are beginning to open soon. I was speaking in terms of backpackers/backcountry camps as well as dispersed camping. Which both make sense in terms of social distancing. Thanks again."

"I have reservations to camp at Canyon in July. It seems it is open but it doesn't make sense to me. IF they are closing rooms with shared baths, why keep the campgrounds open with all those people sharing restroom and baths. I really wanted to go this year with my family but the more i think about it the more risk of infection is involved with camping. People coming from every part of the country and sharing camp restrooms seems like it would be a pretty risky thing unfortunately."

I was curious to know how the park service was going to handle lodging/dining this year after all this started. I had made backcountry plans last year when booking my trip for September 2020. By coincidence/fate I booked cabins w/ bath lodging this year vs. the usual lodges. I will also have some of those bookings that I will need to cancel now that my backcountry permit has been approved -- I will be sure to put a post on the forum in the event that it helps someone else grab a room. I will miss my morning buffet breakfasts. . . but I'm looking forward to a potentially less crowded park. Perhaps the mornings/evenings will be less congested if more day trips are taken into the park -- maybe less tour busses if international travel bans are still in place? Or maybe the roads will be even more congested if more people are driving in? I'll be sure to watch for earlier trip reports as they begin to happen.This is of course if I still get to go. There is a lot of time between now and September and who knows what will change between now and then. I'll choose to be optimistic and hope for the best!
"Well, Xanterra has changed all the information. It is anyone's guess what will actually happen!"
"From our local newspaper today:With decisions on Yellowstone’s opening still in flux, the park’s main concessioner has had to make decisions now that will affect operations this summer—the most significant of which will mean the iconic Old Faithful Inn will not reopen in 2020.Authorized concessionaire Xanterra Parks & Resorts operates lodging, restaurants, and retail in Yellowstone National Park. It is the largest concessioner in the park with more than 830 buildings, 9 hotels with 2,000-plus rooms, and more than 30 food services facilities and tour operations.On Tuesday, Xanterra announced drastic staff cuts for its Yellowstone operations—reducing employees from the normal 3,500 for lodging operations to only 800. In addition, there will be no sit-down dine-in options anywhere in Yellowstone; all dining will be “grab and go” options only. Retail restrictions will include limiting the number of shoppers inside gift stores at any given time.Roosevelt Lodge will begin canceling reservations and issuing refunds. Photo: NPSEarlier in the week, Xanterra President and CEO Andrew Todd had hoped to resume operations in Yellowstone soon after the current May 21 closure date announced by the National Park Service. That opening date for Xanterra is now looking like June 15…maybe.“This decision was not easy and we recognize the significant impact on your travel plans, but we know that this is the responsible path forward to continue to help slow the spread of the disease,” Todd stated.And the biggest bummer for tourists will be the closure of Old Faithful Inn, Grant Village, and Roosevelt Lodge for the entire 2020 season. Those with reservations at any of these lodging facilities this summer will have their reservations canceled and be refunded their money.Only lodging facilities with cabins with private baths will be open this summer. Frontier cabins, Western cabins, and Cottages only will be available at the following locations and revised operating seasons: Mammoth Hotel: June 15 – November 1, 2020 Old Faithful Lodge: June 15 – October 4, 2020 Old Faithful Snow Lodge: June 15 – October 25, 2020 Lake Hotel: June 17 – October 4, 2020 Lake Lodge: June 17 – September 27, 2020 Canyon Lodge: June 19 – October 12, 2020Tours and activities will be limited to guide boats, boat rentals and dock slips at the marina, horseback rides at Canyon Lodge, and bike rentals at Old Faithful Snow Lodge. No road-based tours, Scenicruise, Stagecoach rides, or Old West Cookout.Packages will not be available due to limited services, and group bus/van transportation is discontinued for the season. Current 2020 package reservations will be canceled automatically and refunded.Xanterra campgrounds will be open as follows.

"The ""old information"" is in the OP, starting with ""Limited Lodging"" and the camping information is in the next post.Re the question about self-quarantine, this may be helpful.

Plus 14 nights to do nothing can be pricey -https:/…14daytravelerquarantine""“While we love our visitors, we would ask that you not come visit while Montanans are watching out for one another by staying at home,” said Governor Bullock. “This is important not only to protect our health care system, but also to protect against the spread of COVID-19.”“As of today, travel from another state or country is the most common known source of COVID-19 infections in Montana. I am asking anyone who is in Montana and has recently traveled from another state or country to do the right thing and self-quarantine for 14 days,” continued Governor Bullock.The Directive applies both to Montana residents and non-residents entering the state for non-work-related purposes. It requires a self-quarantine for 14 days, or the duration of a non-work trip to Montana—whichever is shorter. The Directive also instructs the Montana Department of Commerce to advise vacation listing and rental sites that they must notify potential out-of-state renters about the quarantine requirement. Health care workers are excluded from the Directive.Further, the Directive authorizes the Montana National Guard to conduct temperature checks at Montana airports and rail stations and screen for potential exposure history for travelers arriving in Montana from another state or country.The Directive is effective now through April 10, 2020.

"I would be the first to support the governors' right to do what is right for their state and I will abide by any orders. Just mentioning the cost for a state with a lot of tourism.Obviously, people will not travel to sit in their room."
"I was finally able to reach Xanterra this evening and the person I spoke to said definitely NOT to cancel our Lake Hotel room reservations- he said it was unknown at this point if hotel rooms would be closed later in the summer. Did he think I was referring to Lake Hotel cottages? I didn't think so but from reading through this thread it sounds like all of you think cabins are the only option?! Or maybe I misinterpreted your comments- the official email I received WAS confusing ""Yellowstone Natl Park Lodges Closed Through June 14."" I agree that the likelihood of general lodging being open later in the summer is iffy and so I made some back up cabin reservations as well.In regard to Montana's 14 day quarantine for out of state visitors, isn't it unlikely that this will be in effect the entire summer? Of course it's possible and something to be aware of.We have pricey plane tickets we bought a long time ago but will cancel our trip if the risk of infection seems high. We've had the luxury of working from home and staying in. I'm just as concerned about infection staying outside the Park in a regular hotel room- we might opt for a house rental if we travel at all."
"I’ll just add that Idaho also has a 14-day quarantine for out of state visitors. If someone flew in to SLC they would likely drive thru a bit of Idaho to get to Yellowstone. I can’t say how it is being enforced in Eastern Idaho but last Saturday the Kootenai County Sheriff deputies along with the Idaho State Police were stopping everyone with an out of state car tag at one of the local lakes in the Coeur d’Alene area. It was crowded and people were not social distancing. Drivers were asked to return home. Most of the out of state tags were from WA as the WA/iD line is just a few miles west and under normal circumstances there is a lot of movement back and forth. At this time the Governor plans a phased opening starting April 30 but I don’t know that a date has been set for the lifting of the 14-day quarantine for out of staters. One area of Idaho, the Sun Valley area, was hit early and hit hard. They had not moved to restrict gatherings and the ski hills were still open so a valuable lesson was learned there. I think they will be cautious about reopening. Pam"
@Anonj....Xanterra has changed their minds multiple times over the last few days. At first they said only cabins with private baths would open. Then they implied OF Inn and maybe Roosevelt would open. Who knows what will be next. It’s also been clear that the staff is not being informed of changes as quickly as things shift. I’m not sure I’d cancel anything right now if you are OK with the deposits hanging out there. Keep the back up stuff too to see how things settle out. If you are not traveling until later in the summer things might he more apparent after they open mid-June. Or not!!Pam
Deb noted that Bullock has said that the 14 day quarantine would be in effect through phase 3. That will be a while.
"@D0bby , gosh I hope they don't change their mind on Roosevelt, I already rebooked to Mammoth and cancelled my 2 nights. I was afraid if i was double booked I'd lose both, weren't they starting to monitor for that? But if there is a quarantine in all 3 or 4 surrounding states we will have to cancel the entire trip anyway."
"Thanks for the feedback on the quarantine.That said...yuck. Feels like one step forward (planned park opening), one-two steps back (quarantine). Be interesting to see how political pressure ramps up if things stay calm from Covid there, and the realized financial loss starts to loom."
"The problem is that yes the numbers of infections in Montana and Wyoming are low. But what happens if millions of people flock to Yellowstone over the summer every part of the country. There is no way Wyoming and Montana would have the medical resources and hospital beds to handle a potential surge in cases due to all the tourists. Like i said i have a 3 week camping trip planned for my family of 4 to Teton, Yellowstone and Glacier in July. I am keeping the reservations but I honestly dont think its going to happen. And even if we are techinically allowed to do this trip, if we were to get sick during this trip it would be a nightmare. I'm going to remain hopeful but i've told my 8 year old twins not to get their hopes up unfortunately."
"Well said, Alemmo. That is our situation and outlook as well."
"""The problem is that yes the numbers of infections in Montana and Wyoming are low. But what happens if millions of people flock to Yellowstone over the summer every part of the country.

Sheltering in place. Self-quaranting at home. Not traveling. Everything.So if you get sick, you go to your home hospital. Don't overwhelm a small but excellent hospital (5 star) with visitors coming in already sick but asymptomatic or visitors getting sick while they are here - infected in a dining room or on a crowded boardwalk.I had excellent care at St. Johns' Urgent Care Clinic this January, but they were plenty busy with locals (I assume) there with the flu. I can't imagine St. Johns' handling a rush of Covid 19 patients at their hospital and/or urgent care. EXCELLENT providers of health care but VERY small. A friend was sick with the flu (thanks to the coughing guy between us on the plane) and finally went to the medical clinic at Old Faithful. I think they had a total of 3 patients and I waited most of the day at the Geyser Grill, VC and in the car. One woman had been treated the previous day at Lake's clinic with breathing problems and they finally opted to transport her to an outside of the park (YNP) hospital. Mammoth's clinic may be bigger (it's the only one open all year) but the clinics in YNP are TINY.Billings has an excellent hospital (per a family member) but their capacity has to be small. I don't know the hospital capacity within a 100 mile radius of YNP, but it has to be very limited, especially given the volume of YNP visitation. Sick visitors would quickly overwhelm local (within 100 miles) hospitals.That has to be a major concern - plus passing the infection on to locals. No matter how you paint it, it's not a pretty picture."
"Oh I get it....I can completely understand the reticence to allowing folks from outside in. But we're going to have these conditions for 18 months or so before a vaccine is readily available. At some point you either have to accept some risk, or wither and have other forms of long-term impacts.I've really never envied those in political leadership positions....but now, you just have to feel bad for them. What trying decisions to make."
"In short, this is a hot mess."
"""But we're going to have these conditions for 18 months or so before a vaccine is readily available. At some point you either have to accept some risk, or wither and have other forms of long-term impacts.""Yellowstone will still be there.Xanterra has a 20 year contract. The billionaire that owns Xanterra can weather this storm.That's why, IF I were coming to the park THIS year, I'd stay in a gateway town. THOSE business owners may not make it to 2021.The park will still be there. Xanterra will still have the contract on in-park lodging. They will still be jacking up the prices in the park. It's ludicrous the increase in prices in just the last 5 years.My $ would be going to the good people trying to support their families and trying not to lose their homes."
"I agree -- its what we have been planning to do. Stay in a VRBO, eat in the local restaurants, go to a rodeo, take a local tour, etc.But if that gateway town is in MT (West Yellowstone)…...per what was just posted on here last night, the VRBO may be worthless. Which means I can't come, and which means all those small businesses that I would have bought from, are impacted."
They just changed their cancellation policy to 7 days instead of 30 day.
Just got another email from Xanterra in response to the one they sent the other day saying they had cancelled my stay at Snow Lodge for June 24th. It now says they are keeping my reservation in place with the hopes they can open additional lodging as the season unfolds.
"Good grief....yet another change. What a mess.Cheffie, Xanterra had started contacting people when it was apparent that they had double bookings but they are in such disarray right now I can't imagine they have the personnel to keep up with this policy right now. Even if it is a computer generated thing, the staff still have to do a manual cancellation.Pam"
"Just looking at some numbers, it seems that it might be wise for Montana to spend the cash radically increase hospital facilities in tourist areas.The tourism council says that tourism brings $3.7 billion to the state. If you make the simplistic assumption that 10% goes to the state coffers, Montana gets $370 million.Wouldn't it makes sens to spend $40-50 million to build and staff temp hospitals instead of losing $370 million?This site has a list of hospital beds in Montana:https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_MT.htmlI could not get the chart to show up formatted here, so you will need to look at the site.I took the numbers for the chart and estimated be utilization by dividing patient days by beds.Bozeman looks like the busiest (most stressed) in the state.Hospital Name City PatientDays Per BedBenefis East Campus Great Falls 90Billings Clinic Hospital Billings 259Blackfeet Community Hospital Browning 75Bozeman Health Big Sky Medical Center Big Sky 21Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital Bozeman 267Community Medical Center Missoula 139Great Falls Clinic Hospital Great Falls 191Kalispell Regional Medical Center Kalispell 143Northern Montana Hospital Havre 20Providence Saint Patrick Hospital Missoula 217Saint Peter's Hospital Helena 174Saint Vincent Healthcare Billings 199St. James Healthcare Butte 209The HealthCenter Kalispell 47T O T A L 156"
"OK. I have a question. It was stated that the 14 day quarantine will stay in effect through phase 3 in Montana. Is this really the case? If so, I don't think I should be making reservations for next year. We were planning on also going to Glacier National Park after Yellowstone. But this would not work if the quarantine remains through phase 3. Phase 3 might not even be here by next summer. I have had to cancel this years June/July plans and don't want to go through all of this again next year."
""" It now says they are keeping my reservation in place with the hopes they can open additional lodging as the season unfolds.""That's great news! I hope it holds!"
">>>OK. I have a question. It was stated that the 14 day quarantine will stay in effect through phase 3 in Montana. Is this really the case?

If you could let me know where you saw that or are hearing it from, I'd appreciate it.While I think most of us had thought and hoped (I'm still hoping), that each phase would last approximately two weeks if our numbers kept decreasing or at least stayed overall stable, Montana's governor has been pretty clear that their is no set end date for Phase 1 (which we just started). This is his statement in an op-ed he released on Friday 4/24:But let me be clear: we could very well be in the first phase for a long time. We will not move out of phase one if the curve doesn’t remain flat. The reality is, this virus isn’t gone from Montana and it will continue to be with us, even as we work to contain it. This isn’t the time for a celebratory barbecue or going out to the breweries and bars several nights a week. For a lot of Montanans, including our most vulnerable, this phase should be substantially similar to the stay at home period. Once we begin to reopen, we want to be able to stay open.We must begin to create a new normal. Montanans must continue to go to great lengths to protect one another. Follow hand washing and sanitizing recommendations. Strongly consider using a non-medical face covering when in public. Nursing homes will continue to suspend visitation. The 14-day travel quarantine when entering Montana for non-work-related purposes will remain in effect.https:/…No one knows what the future holds for us here in Montana and in Wyoming for that matter as they have the same 14 Day Self-Quarantine Directive in place that we do. Their directive runs until April 30th. It will be interesting to see if their governor extends it.Glacier Park is dealing with the same uncertainty. The following is a quote for their park's superintendent in a 4/24 interview with MTN News:On Thursday, Superintendent of the park Jeff Mow told MTN News that when the park will open will be a coordinated effort between the state, county and the park's tribal partners.He explained that it's possible the park could reopen in phase three of Bullock's plan, since that includes interstate travel.However, the park has not heard any direction from the Flathead County Healthy Department on whether the park should open.Mow says that the county's health department originally asked the park to close due to health concerns involving Coronavirus. Mow is aware the national park attracts visitors from all over the world and says the park won't open until the park's gateway communities are comfortable with outsiders coming in.He told MTN that the park also is looking at it's neighbors to the north for direction.He says, Canada's parks remain closed until the end of May.He understands that opening the park is a very dynamic situation and a balance of public health and economic activity.https:/…>>>Phase 3 might not even be here by next summer. I have had to cancel this years June/July plans and don't want to go through all of this again next year.<<<I would think that would be the case all over the country (and world for that matter) this summer. Even though it's heartbreaking to cancel a trip, this just might just be a good time where people need to plan get-a-ways/trips in their own states. DebEdited: 12:53 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"I understand what you are saying. But at this point there is no way to know when things will start to open. All the officials set a date and then the date is extended and in some cases extended again. The CDC and WHO keep claiming there will be a second round come the winter time. We might just be back at the same place next year as we are now. No one knows. Maybe yes, maybe no. My husband retired in January. We were supposed to come to Yellowstone and Glacier last September but his retirement got put off to this year. So we had to cancel all those reservations. We rescheduled for this June and have had to cancel. A couple of years ago we were supposed to go to Glacier and they had the fires so we had to cancel.We also had a cruise that was supposed to go out on May 4. That was cancelled. We were supposed to go to Disney in October but we have cancelled it as things don't look good amusement parks. We are all cancelled out!!!!! I think I am through with having to make reservations far in advance for a vacation and having to make deposits of $200 to $300 a location. Especially in these uncertain times.I know things can open up at Yellowstone closer in but I don't want to hope that we can find something that doesn't cost a fortune. And having a day or 2 in one place then nothing for a couple of days just doesn't work when you have to travel 2500 and more miles round trip with hopes of getting a place to stay.Your states have to do what is right for them, but we also have to do what is right for us. Being in our late 60's and early 70's means we just might not make it back to Yellowstone, We have been there before and it was great but it just might never happen again."
"Xanterra just updated 4-26-26""Xanterra Travel Collection reaffirmed today that it anticipates re-opening limited lodging and other services in Yellowstone National Park as of June 15, 2020. Xanterra is working closely with the National Park Service (NPS) as well as the states of Wyoming and Montana to start welcoming guests on a somewhat limited basis and is taking a measured approach to protect the wellness of employees, visitors and local residents.The reopening of lodging and other services in Yellowstone National Park will follow guidelines of the CDC, respective states and NPS. Specific details on new protocols and procedures will be announced over the next few weeks and posted online. As the summer and fall seasons progress, food and beverage outlets and availability of accommodations may expand based on the ability to maintain a safe environment for visitors and employees as well as NPS staff.Initially, lodging options will be limited to cabins with private bathrooms. This means that only Frontier Cabins, Western Cabins, and Cottages will be open at Old Faithful, Canyon, Mammoth, and Lake areas. All Xanterra-operated campgrounds except Fishing Bridge RV Park will also be open this summer. There will also be limited food services, tours and activities, and gift shops."""
"I was on the phone for 40 minutes before I got through to reservations, then 40 more minutes until I got through to an agent. I kept my original reservation for a room, but snagged a cabin in late September. All will probably sort itself out as summer hopefully allows changes."

"“ You see only one night available. Is it best to book it and then watch for a cancellation for the other night? Can the reservations then be consolidated to one by calling Xanterra the downside being you pay for both nights in advance?”Yes - grab a room when you see it. Maybe - you can combine if they are the same room level. I’ve had the phone agent tell me it was not possible to do. When I checked in to the OF Lodge And asked the desk if they could combine, the manager came right over, said of course and did it in 5 minutes. He said the phone agents should be able to do it as they are on the same system but sometimes they think they can’t. So ask at check in if thry cannot combine over the phone. Pam"
Darn...tried to edit but didn’t catch it in time. My post 101 was in response to post 100 which has been removed by the author. Pam
"Thanks for the response. I removed it because I after I posted it, I was able to snag the 2 nights I wanted at Old Faithful Snow Lodge Western Cabin. I went ahead and booked one night at Mammoth and I might stick with that.Now I feel comfortable cancelling my reservations in West Yellowstone.Edited: 1:56 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Great luck booking!""I went ahead and booked one night at Mammoth and I might stick with that.""Spending a night in a Mammoth cabin is one of my top 2 favorite places in the park! I would definitely ""stick with that"".It also had the only really decent cell service in the park (Verizon). Not only could I access everything I wanted, a friend using my work phone as a hotspot was playing cat videos on Facebook! After days of 1980s era connection, I was shocked! Of course, there will be good service in gateway towns like West Yellowstone.Edited: 2:11 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Onemoreroad - What I meant by that was between watching for a 2nd night in Mammoth or sticking with 1 night in Cooke City, 1 night Mammoth. I am planning on flying into Billings. However, currently the flight prices have gone up and are $120 more person than Bozeman. If they stay like that, then I I'll watch for the 2nd night in Mammoth and skip Cooke City.I'll definitely keep that night in Mammoth.Now I have to watch for 2 nights in Canyon after OFSL."
"Ahhh. Well, I do love flying into Billings. It's one of my favorite airports. Love the 'pinto"" pony! Love the service. The free luggage carts. Love that it's so small but offers excellent service. I hope you get the 2nd night at Mammoth. That would be my first choice too. I do like Cooke City. It had a ""Northern Exposure"" vibe. It works well for a single overnight so you have an afternoon driving through the Lamar Valley and a morning back, as a launch or ending for the Beartooth and/or using it for an endpoint after driving one side of the park, before heading back for the other side. The hotels will also have TV, a/c and wifi, which can be nice. But staying in the Mammoth cabins are special and I love staying there. I hope you are able to snag a second night!"
Thanks for that advice. That is my dilemma. I want to drive the Beartooth and have an evening in Lamar Valley but it would also be nice to not have two 1 night stays and I'm trying to stay in the park the whole time. No a/c is what I'm most concerned about. We might buy a fan on arrival.It looks like it's 4 1/2 hours wheels turning to get from Billings airport to Mammoth via Beartooth. With stops it would be much longer and we would have an 11:30 am thereabouts arrival. Seems like a long day.
"There are fans in all the cabins, no need to purchase one. Not sure when your trip is (didn't go back through the entire thread), but it cools down at night, keep the cabin closed up during the day, open in the evening on your return and it should cool down."
"Oh, ok that's good to hear about the fans in the rooms. I just can't sleep when I'm hot so I'm taking a real chance.We plan to arrive 9/4. Back home, it could be 100 degrees or it could be in the 70's. I was hoping with Yellowstone being higher elevation that it would be cooler."
Regarding the fans . . . either Deb or Pam once posted to pack an extension cord so you could move the fan around as needed. I thought that was a fabulous idea (and promptly added it to my list! ) lolCarol
"Good advice from thbergs in #108. It's what I do (keeping the cabin closed up during the day), and I've never needed to use a fan."
"Nights will definitely be cold. Daytime temps can be anything. One September it was hotter in Yellowstone that at home (Georgia). I wasn't expecting 80+ degree temps and wore summer clothes and sandals.Here are the temps from last September -https:/…In the 80s for the first week (including 9/4) but temps did drop afterwards.Edited: 1:27 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"Yes, that was me about the extension cord. I, also can't sleep when I'm too warm so I need the fan. I like to position it so that it is in front of an open window and sometimes the plugs are not well located for that!I'll open the window and turn on the fan as soon as the sun goes down and the temps start dropping. Even in mid-late August which is traditionally warmer than September I've not had problems. Well, the only problem is if you leave the window open with the fan going and go to sleep, you'll wake up at 1AM with freezing toes!Pam"
"Because it was mentioned earlier in the thread, regarding keeping distance in the park: """"There are businesses doing this very successfully right now in the middle of this pandemic. We are taking a lot of mitigation actions from the private sector, actions that have been proven to reduce exposure to employees,"" Superintendent Cam Sholly said. ""We will have proper mitigation measures in place prior to opening particular facilities. If we can't protect them, we won't open them. I'm impressed with the ideas and innovation of the Park Service team here, and our partners, in coming up with methods for protecting each other, and allowing for visitors to begin accessing the park again. We are involving these employees in conversations around what can help make the safer to potential exposure. This work is continuing.""The Yellowstone superintendent reiterated what he said last week about expecting visitors to police themselves when it comes to maintaining social distancing.""I'll hope the general public follows health guidelines around social distancing, but if they don't, I can guarantee we're not putting NPS employees into the middle of large crowds."" Sholly said. ""We will do our best to communicate with the public to take personal responsibility, but we will not have employees out there telling people to spread out or anything like that. In other words, if the public wants to put themselves at risk, that doesn't mean NPS employees need to be exposed to that same level of risk.""I'm mostly referring to outside areas where we literally can't control where people go or congregate,"" he said. ""For example, how do you control 11,000 people per day on the Old Faithful boardwalk, that is basically accessible 360 degrees around, no control point where you could meter visitors if you wanted?""""https:/…"
