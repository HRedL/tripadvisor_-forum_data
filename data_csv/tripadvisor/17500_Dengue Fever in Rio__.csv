"News reports are stating that there is a growing outbreak of mosquito borne Dengue Fever in Rio. The recent heavy rains have not helped the situation. The reports are mostly in the Spanish and Portuguese press but also on CNN/Reuters. The outbreak is mostly in Tijuca, apparently. I am heading to Rio in a couple of weeks for Carnival, with my family. Is anyone in Rio now who can give me some feedback on this? I am considering canceling and going another time if it is a real danger. Also, I'm heading to Buzios where, presumably, there are more mosquitoes. I am not paranoid but want to be careful, especially with my kids. Rio had a large outbreak 5+ yrs ago and it was a big problem. Rio is a huge city. And, when I was there last year I don't recall seeing even one mosquito. Is this kind of like ""bird flu,"" something in the background all the time --- or a real serious issue there? Thanks."
"There is no dengue epidemic.There are 200 reported cases,mostly in the slums.5 yearsago there were 200,000 cases,which obviously constituted an epidemic,as well as a lethalversion which caused hemmoragic fever."
Thank you.
"From what I gather, two people have contracted Dengue Fever, which is common in other parts of Brazil, but not Rio. In 2002, 134 people died from it, so people are freaking out because they're worried it's coming back.Here's the recent stories mentioned:alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N26376317.htmcnn.com/2006/…Here is some information about Dengue Fever:mdtravelhealth.com/infectious/dengue_fever.h…www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/ybGet.asp…We were there in November - not one mosquito."
"i was in rio and buzios late last year and i seriously doubt that you have to worry about dengue fever at those places. now if you are travelling deep into the amazon, THEN you might want to be concerned with dengue fever."
"If you are staying in and around the rio area you need not worry about Dengue. Can't remember if it was the 2002 or 2003 trip to rio for carnival (rain, rain, rain) there was an outbreak but that is only in the outskirts of the city. For example, my friend lives in Nilopolis and he caught dengue which you can treat just like you would treat the flu. I found no mosquitos walking around in copa. "
"I caught Dengue Fever in Rio back in 2002! I ignored the warnings and paid the price! Let me just say that many people had it when I was there! The key is to not get bit by mosquitoes. I was ok when I stayed in the hotel where I kept the windows shut a night at all times. However I stayed at a guest house where the windows were open and I got bit several times. Out of 12 people staying there I was the only one who got bit. Perhaps it was my cologne or soap that attracted the moquitoes. So yes, go to Rio but close those windows at night! Also bring mosquito spray or purchase some from a pharmacy in Brazil. The fever lasted for about 4 days and was awful. It's worse than the flu. There is no cure and tylenol is the only medicine! Rio is actually the hotspot for Dengue. It's not as bad in other cities. Another thing that might help is long sleeve pants and shirts at night. Like I said, out of 12 people at the house I was the only one who got bit! Bad luck I suppose! Dengue put in the bed for 4 days of sweats and chills not to mention a complete loss of appetite and headaches and weakness. Luckily I was in Brazil for 2 months so 4 days wasn't too much time lost. I was in Rio for about two weeks when I got bit by those mosquitoes. What I am saying that if you get bit the mosquitoes probably have dengue!"
sorry about that my friend. You know I'm quite juicy too! Now that I recall when I did go to Nilopolis to my friends house for lunch they were biting me but not my husband. Also when I went to the water park and left around 5 ish in the evening the mosquitos must have come out because I started getting bit over there as well. So I would have to say it probably happens at night. Meaning they look for dinner at night! 
"Having started this post, I figure I should give an update. After much discussion, talking to a number of people in Rio (including a friend who is there now), and doing way more internet research on Dengue Fever and the current situation in Rio than I could ever have imagined..............................We are heading to Rio for Carnival.It seems that, although there is a real issue there, with more than a 1,000 cases, way more than last year, the problem is pretty isolated to the western suburbs and favelas, the City has undertaken a strong response with spraying, etc., and DEET is way effective in repelling mosquitoes. Plus, the Dengue mosquitoes bite in the early a.m. (we are sleeping) and in the late afternoon. They don't seem to be flocking to Ipanema beach or downtown Rio. And, with the world what it is right now, between Avian Flu and the risk of getting hit by a taxi as I cross the street in NYC, we don't want a mosquito to rule our lives. So, with some Deep Woods Off and a postiive attitude we are heaing south. Thanks for all the input from others. "
"First of all Dengue is a day light mosquito, you won't have problems during the evenings at any place (that's the first difference between Dengue and other mosquitos). Dengue contamination this year in Rio has been 90% of cases concentrated in the west area (Barra and Jacarepagua), so as you can see, as long as you keep distance from these areas (which are not the places where you will be probably hanging around), you will be just fine. So, come to Rio and have fun!!"
"if people are wrong,they have a moral obligation to admit and correct.there is in fact a serious dengue problem in rio.the problem is not in the slums,it is in BArra,where I stayed the last 3 weeks.local barra newspapers had daily reports.about 200 cases a day.problem aggravated because mosquito eradication squads concentrated entirely in the slums,even though the documented center of problem is Barra.talked to several people in area who had friends in hospital.best solution is mosquito repellent product from Johnson and Johnson.cost$10. used every day."
