"I know I am going to get a great deal of vitriol from this post, but am writing it anyway. This is a worldwide pandemic. I am literally the least obsessive about such things of any person I know. But for the sake of the health and wellbeing of the entire world, please do whatever you can to slow the spread of this virus. We will all be exposed eventually. That is virtually certain. Most of us will either have no symptoms or will be only very mildly ill. But the numbers of people needing hospitalization are rising dramatically in every state, and if each of us doesn't do whatever we can to slow the spread, there will be huge spikes in the numbers of people who will need hospital beds and respirators. There are already reports of doctors in Italy having to triage people - do we give the respirator to the 50 year-old with young children, or the 60 year-old with a history of COPD? - and we do not want that to happen here. Although NY is very well supplied with hospitals and respirators and medical personnel, everything has a limit. NYC officials have taken unprecedented measures - cancelling Broadway shows and closing museums, something that has virtually never happened - in order to slow the spread of COVID in the city. People from other areas should honor the spirit of those injunctions and stay away until things settle down. If for no other reason than so as not to bring the virus back to their home towns.I'm sure this will be deleted, and/or will start a string of nasty responses, but I am taking that chance. No one has really said it yet, so I'm taking the leap.PLEASE STAY AWAY. I know for many this means losing money, not to mention losing a long-awaited trip. But those things are small in comparison to the imminent loss of lives we all face."
"I agree with you.If people took things way more seriously in the beginning of the US infections, things wouldn't be as bad as they are getting. Visitors that have travel insurance should be OK. Eg, Australia has declared ""reconsider all need to travel at this time"" and some travel insurance companies are honouring certain policies. Check details and call them to find out."

"I applaud you for writing this!The current situation is just the start. Unfortunately most people not yet directly affected are in for a rude awakening, and I don’t mean because they won’t be able to get reimbursed for cancelling their plans!!In the meantime, everyone should avoid all nonessential travel and keep washing their hands (with soap and water) for their own benefit as well as everyone else’s. The goal is to delay infection as long as possible, for as many people as possible, ie help “flatten the curve”. If that term doesn’t mean anything to you, I strongly urge you to look it up, because it will help you understand what the OP is saying and why."

"I'm way across the country in L.A. We are dealing with the same issues, and it's scary. Time to take a deep breath and step back.I hope to get to NYC in mid June, but that's understandably fluid now.I want to share a poem I love by Sara Teasdale, which was the basis for a short story by Ray Bradbury. I read it as a child and never forgot the bleak picture it described.We will get through this.""There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,And swallows calling with their shimmering sound;And frogs in the pools singing at night,And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;Robins will wear their feathery fireWhistling their whims on a low fence-wire;And not one will know of the war, not oneWill care at last when it is done.Not one would mind, neither bird nor treeIf mankind perished utterly;And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,Would scarcely know that we were gone.""Edited: 8:42 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Some people are taking a bit longer to grasp the seriousness of what is going on BUT we WILL get through this particular crisis!
"If everyone is careful and follow the rules there is a good chance we can reduce the effect of this pandemic - if people are careless or thoughless they risk not only their own health but that of their families and friends and anyone who comes in contact with them.This is a serious but not yet disastrous situation - but we we all need to keep our wits about us.And please, do not buy up every loaf of brad or quart of milk - it will go bad before you can use it and it prevents others from getting what theyneed. And do remember that bottled water is not necessary - tap water is perfectly safe and tastes fine - get your fears under control."
"I haven't had an issue finding milk. The bread thing kinda baffles me, because it isn't the most long term food item yet people are buying it like there will be no more bread ever again."
"You can freeze bread. People are hoarding milk here too, but I think you can freeze that too."
"I’m now in Wellfleet, Cape Cod, where there have been no reported cases. There is a sign on the door of the main grocery store saying “no more than 2 of ANY ITEM in the store per household”. This is what every store should be doing nationwide!"
I agree with your post. But is it necessary? Trump not letting anyone in anyway. I guess no longer a “hoax”?
"My post was intended for people coming to NYC from other parts of the US, not just from other countries. Definitely not a hoax, but with care and community thoughtfulness we will all get through it together."
Will do. Easy decision. Be safe. Ps- should give NYC enough time to clean up subways etc.
"There is way more coronavirus in the USA than is reported, as you are hardly testing anyone. The last few cases of the virus in Australia were brought in from the USA and previously Tom Hanks and wife too."
"For this to work, it has to be both ways. Don't come to NYC but also don't leave NYC!People should stay put in their homes. It will be much easier to save lives and stop the spread if people just stay at home. Everywhere. I have a trip to USA starting in NYC at end of July. It's been a month now that we are waiting for an opportunity to cancel it."
"""For this to work, it has to be both ways. Don't come to NYC but also don't leave NYC!"" I don't know anyone who is looking to go on vacation from New York. I do know many people who have cancelled their vacation plans myself included. Not only do we not want to risk spreading the virus, but also there is a massive risk leaving your home country in times like this where governments are imposing quarantines on travelers."
"We in Mexico have closed schools and just being good citizens of the world. Kids have remote learning now. We have lots of food, for crissake rice lasts like forever in my cupboard! Please be safe people. No travel unless absolutely necessary."
Well said.I’ve canceled my holiday for tomorrow. Going to ride it out until it’s safe to visit again.God speed.
"I can understand why some people horde, stocking up on food, but why is the entire aisle of most stores empty of toilet paper, paper towels, napkins and tissues? I guess some people have different priorities."
"Unfortunately it’s becoming more and more obvious and unnecessary but I understand the sentiment. “Please Come to NYC” would have been the odd deletable, nasty replies filled thread."
Just canceled my trip last week in March. Sad but know it is for the best. Hoping things turn around soon. Good luck guys. Stay safe.
"""I can understand why some people horde, stocking up on food, but why is the entire aisle of most stores empty of toilet paper, paper towels, napkins and tissues? I guess some people have different priorities."" People when they are under stress feel the need to do something. Unfortunately, they don't know what to do so they buy toilet paper because that is all they can think to do. I wish I had bought stock in Charmin. I buy toilet paper (a normal amount of toilet paper) when I see it at this point because I have to worry about idiots buying out entire cases of it and leaving none for anybody else.I have no compassion for hoarders because they are nothing more than selfish people."

"I love NYC and miss it terribly, but if somebody offered to fly me there tomorrow and put me up in the hotel of my choosing, I'd ask if I could take a rain check. Even at the most base and self interested level, it wouldn't be a very fun trip, with so many attractions and restaurants shutting down. But far greater than that, I don't want to risk catching something and bringing it back home to my parents, who are seniors and have respiratory issues, or exposing other people I might come into contact with.I had an idea today, it might be something for people who are delaying their travel plans to consider. If you want to support NYC based businesses even when you can't come to NYC, one idea might be to buy gift certificates online- Don't bother with chains like Olive Garden or Applebee's, stick to local NYC places. Buy the gift certificates and hold onto them until your trip, so you will have them to use when NYC is ready for visitors again. Same with local attractions heavily dependent on tourist dollars. Give them some $$$ now, which they need, and enjoy some pre-paid meals or admissions later. Also, I don't know about you guys, but if I'm eating at a restaurant and have a gift card that pretty much covers my meal, I might very well be tempted to order a little extra, because it's only a few dollars more out of pocket. So the restaurant gets even more $$$. Same might apply to other local businesses you like to patronize when in town- for me that might include places like The Compleat Sculptor, Manhattan Wardrobe Supply, and a few others."
"Listen to Gov. Cuomo's' press conference today...boy he tells it like it is and he would be the first to say ""do not come""......NYC will be short on ICU beds and ventilators...they don't need tourists who are not smart enough to stay home."
"""Listen to Gov. Cuomo's' press conference today...boy he tells it like it is "" i'm glad someone does."
@28 yes it is refreshing...followed by the press briefing from the White House...such a contrast. Just put Cuomo in charge.
With Ohio shutting down restaurants and bars starting at 9 pm tonight and other states considering the same it’s hard to imagine anyone going anywhere for some time.
People need to stay from New York for their own safety! The numbers of infection have risen significantly there in a short period. And if they were actually resting at the levels they should be there would be even more cases.I wouldn’t be going anywhere near the place.
Our trip to NY is planned for the last week of May. I'm wondering if we will have to cancel. I'm hoping it is much better by then but I don't have a good feeling about it.
"I am in the Travel Industry and a licensed Insurance agent selling Trip Cancellation Insurance , and I can assure you there is only ONE Trip Insurance policy available that provides ANY refunds in the event of Cancellation due to a Pandemic!. It is called a “Cancel for any reason” style policy that costs 40% to 70% more than a standard policy and you only qualify for a Fraction of the actual loss incurred. Few people take that coverage."
"""Our trip to NY is planned for the last week of May. I'm wondering if we will have to cancel."" I don't know. What I am confident in saying is that by the end of May even if you are allowed to travel here which is a big IF depending on how this goes I can't imagine all the tourist stuff will be up and running."
I'm thinking more like September for things being closer to normal.
"""I'm thinking more like September for things being closer to normal."" I think it will be at least a year and a half to two years before we are back to normal. Its not going to go away anytime soon and outbreaks will likely come in cycles."
"#36 Yes, that is what a government report predicted for 18 months with multiple waves of the disease. Everything is wait and see at this point."

"I agree with the OP, as it is just too risky to oneself and others! Stay home.It's a huge pain not to be able to travel, but the pandemic requires all of us to stay home. Personally, I'd give my left arm to hop on a plane and spend 7-10 days in NYC, visit The Met, join an EATING WITH ZIGGY tour, cycle around Central Park, visit friends/family in Brooklyn, walk across the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset, eat in Hell's Kitchen, enjoy a late evening view at TOTR. That's my wish.So much is closed in NYC, thankfully, because of the pandemic ... as it should be. All of us want to get the hell out of the house, but it's incredibly irresponsible and dangerous to ourselves and to others. We can blame whoever you like for X, Y and Z, but personal responsibility is paramount at this time - and will likely continue another year plus.I plan to return to NYC when it's safe and not a minute earlier. We (I) can wimper at home with Oreo cookies beckoning us from the cupboard, as I/we sip coffee or tea in the morning."
"Hmmm, NYC is actually one of the SAFEST cities to travel right now when it comes to COVID. The virus has been basically contained in NYC and NY state, however the fear remains that folks traveling from high infection states will spread it again in NY. Therefore, if you are planning on coming from a high infection state, please stay home for now. For those thinking about coming from less infected states, then I will tell you that there are now thousands of outdoor restaurants with plenty of expanded seating including Hells Kitchen. Beaches are open, statue of liberty and zoos are open with advanced ticket purchases. But, we are in for another very hot Mon - Wed. As of now, the heat and humidity is supposed to subside by Thurs and hopefully through the following week.Edited: 1:31 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"Pet #45, it is incredibly short-sighted & risky to suggest anyone traveling to or from “safe” cities visit NYC or anywhere.

"Adherence per stipulations provided, of course, right?? How has the U.S. done, to date, per recommended safety protocols? Answer: not great."
"I think what everyone needs to do, in addition to wearing masks and keeping their distance, is keep in mind that on this forum, as on many forums, there are people seeking to further their own interests."
"Thank you, QQ2 - (sigh). If the shoe fits ... oy vey! (referred to myself)"
"IMO masks definitely help, but they aren't 100% effective. I believe that travel is what is going to prolong this - my rural area was almost down to no cases, then people started to travel more and our numbers have started to rise again."
"""IMO masks definitely help, but they aren't 100% effective."" Masks are quite effective when used in conjunction with social distancing and other precautions. People who think that they can throw on a mask and then go into a crowd that is not socially distancing are very much mistaken, especially when you have people who do not know how to wear masks properly to begin with and they end up contaminating themselves and others."
@Red259 I wish I could post your response all over the internet. Even I have been wondering the same thing since that is what people are basically doing but I too doubt if that is enough.
I am scared and agree with you

"Globe 2, you are incredibly rude and completely wrong. There is no reason why someone cannot travel to another city (like NYC) in a safe manner. There are still several tourists traveling to NYC as we speak and there is no virus spike among them, which proves you are the one who is short-sighted and totally wrong. Learn some respect! Currently, the only virus spikes are among those between the ages of 15 and 30, who attended recent house parties and behaved recklessly."
"George, in what rural area in NY was there a large spike in cases? Also, do you have a valid source backing up your claim as hospitalizations and daily death rates continue to reach an all time low in NY state? Even if there was a spike somewhere, what evidence do you have that it was due to an out of state traveler? I would like to see an up to date valid source backing that up as well."
"There was nothing rude about Globe 2's post. It was an opinion, respectfully and regretfully expressed.As a Manhattanite who loves tourists, loves helping with directions and leading them to we're they're going...I'm still very much scarred by what we have gone through, and the illnesses and deaths of friends and relatives. I don't want to see this return. And I don't think the city is ready for visitors. The restaurants don't have capacity (to make one reservation, I had to call a dozen restaurants), the lines to get into stores (I waited 20 minutes to get into Sephora in SoHo), much work still being done remotely...city residents are still adjusting (and many will be returning from where they've been quarantining soon). If people must come now, they will have a limited experience...but I wish they wouldn't. Until we have our act together, and the virus is reduced around the country, addressing the needs of travelers cannot be the priority. Businesses have to figure out how to operate first.Major league baseball having to cancel so many games so quickly, even with fan-less stadiums, is a perfect example of the obstacles we don't even know about yet.Edited: 9:19 am, July 28, 2020 "
"Of course, indoor attractions as museums are still closed. The Met has tentatively given a date of Sept. as a general opening, though not for every day of the week or for as many hours as before. What will happen between now and then remains to be seen and I can imagine postponements if infection rates rise. I heard one authority mention that a vaccine would likely not be available until a year from now assuming at least one under development is effective and safe. The other question is how long immunity, even from having the disease, will provide protection. Covid-19 is a new disease, and not a kind of flu, and there are things not yet known about it."
"“There are still several tourists traveling to NYC as we speak and there is no virus spike among them, which proves you are the one who is short-sighted and totally wrong. Learn some respect!”Wow, it’s sad that after so much mayhem and heartache there are still individuals having a hard time with reality. A few cases in November—spontaneously appearing far away in another country—grew into the disaster that the world is living with today; the devastating news reports from Europe, in February and March, weren’t enough to open their eyes; death and financial ruin for so many throughout April and May, in their own and neighbouring states, wasn’t enough; and now, in July, it still doesn’t register that this virus is different? Is putting peoples’ lives at risk a month or two FROM NOW really worth having a few beers today? Talk about not having respect :(("
"Risa, when a person directly calls another ""short-sighted"", yes it is indeed rude! Therefore, I gave it right back to them along with proof they were wrong!Yes, anyone traveling to NYC right now will not have even close to the normal fun experience that they would have had before this over this pandemic. However, many people are not expecting much and just want to make the most out of it and get away for a few days. There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, there were a few MLB players who got the virus (but they are not dying and its not the end for 99% of people who get it). MLB will still continue even if a game has to be postponed every now and then to reduce spread from using the same locker rooms. Shouldn't they just sanitize and deep clean locker rooms between uses? There is definitely enough money in baseball to pay for that. Also, the positivity rate for COVID in NY is only around 1% positivity rate. Hospitalizations are still decreasing significantly. Lets not turn a blind eye to the facts!"
"Fox, there are THREE vaccine companies already in Phase 3 of trials and they are all showing nothing but good results so far. All three of these companies claim there is a good chance of getting a vaccine ready by the end of the year AND perhaps even getting the vaccine available to first responders by October! I am not sure which ""authority"" is telling you that there wont be a vaccine for another year, but that is completely false based on recent statements directly from Pfiser and Moderna."
"“Yes, there were a few MLB players who got the virus (but they are not dying and its not the end for 99% of people who get it).”They may not die but they may never play professional baseball again, https:/… .BTW, for anyone interested, I have a cousin in the Boston area whose daughter died ~ 25 years ago; she was in her 20’s at the time of her death, and in hospital awaiting a heart double-lung transplant needed as a result of myocarditis that resulted from a simple viral infection a year or two before. My cousin has not yet recovered from loosing her child. I don’t doubt that there will be many parents losing their young adult children in the next few years because of complications resulting from a mild COVID experience. These potential consequences need to be stressed more with the younger crowd; the signs are already there that a mild infection may lead to lifelong illness in some, as a result of damage to various organs."
"Yes, we don't have all the data points. How could we? It's a new virus. But the anecdotal evidence so far from people, even young healthy people who have had the virus, is that the effects linger and there are respiratory and cardiac consequences. That is so difficult and needs to be considered when we talk about mortality rates."
"Some people have strong feelings and that's fine, the best we can do is to agree to disagree at times. Feelings don't necessarily equate to facts though, so keep that in mind. I'm still in the belief that one should do whatever they can to stay healthy. The vast majority of people that have died from Covid had some underlying health condition(s). There are so many people that test positive and are asymptomatic. We don't know the long term effects, if any, at this point in time. Speculation can be a bad thing. If someone is fearful, that's fine, they can stay home and isolate if they choose. The fact remains, people are traveling, albeit at a much lower rate than normal, but people are traveling. None of us know the future, but fear is not good for ones immune system."
"#65I sense that you were trying to be polite in your response, and in reality I cannot disagree with most of what you said. I will however point out the following:1. “The vast majority of people that have died from Covid had some underlying health condition(s).” TRUE2. “There are so many people that test positive and are asymptomatic. We don't know the long term effects, if any, at this point in time.” ALSO TRUE3. IMO Going forward, there is a good chance that the number of individuals living with underlying health conditions resulting from #2 is going to be much higher than the number of individuals who succumbed in #1. POSSIBLE4. “None of us know the future, but fear is not good for ones immune system.” AGREED5. Also, imo, very few individuals will be able to live in complete isolation for the next year or two; they will *need* to go out at times for a variety of reasons. LIKELYQuestions:Why should those doing everything to take care of, and protect, themselves and others have to “fear” the consequences of the increased risk resulting from people who don’t NEED to travel but WANT to travel at this time? Did their parents forget to teach them the difference between a “want” and a “need”? Aren’t most laws put in place to protect the vulnerable from those who have failed to learn self-control?

Planes are still flying and people should not stop traveling in my opinion. I agree that coming here for example, or any city, is going to be limiting. But I'm using traveling generically, not just for those wanting to come here. There is no law preventing people from traveling. There are travel advisories and what Mike had mentioned earlier was that it's a good time to come here for people not on the travel advisory. Someone from one of the states not on the advisory is allowed to come here and come and go as they please. Again, if someone is that fearful, let them adjust their lifestyle as needed."
Its not a good time for non-essential travel to NYC. Things aren't fully open. The virus is peaking in some states and on the cusp of having major outbreaks in other states. The people who actually live in the neighborhoods where tourists will be coming and will be the ones exposed to tourists have been very clear that now is not the time to return to the city.
"""Again, if someone is that fearful, let them adjust their lifestyle as needed.""So all the medical workers first responders, grocery clerks, transit workers and similar should feel free to stay home?"

"@70 And I am giving my opinion, as someone who actually lives in NYC in an area where tourists frequent and can see the situation on the ground, as to why now is not the time for non-essential travel to NYC. Just because a state is not on the travel advisory list doesn't mean there isn't COVID in their states and just because someone can travel doesn't mean they should, especially for such a diminished experience."
And the FACT also remains that some are on this forum in furtherance of their own personal and/or business interests.
"#71 - the problem is, the earlier post that was being responded to wasn’t framed as giving your personal opinion, but rather to be speaking for “the people” more generally. I live here, too, and my view is a little different. Obviously, no one who lives in a hot spot should be traveling to NYC for fun right now. And obviously, with so many places still closed/limited, anyone who comes here now is going to have a different kind of NYC experience. But this resident has no problem with people coming here as long as they behave responsibly.

"I can't control or change what other people do outside my family (and even then ,,.). I can only control what I do. I think being fearful of and/or annoyed at what the actions of others may potentially cause is not a healthy way to live. IMO we live in a self-indulgent society (much different from when I was younger) so it doesn't surprise me that people travel to far flung places in a pandemic because they can. No indoor dining or plane travel for me but I am not opposed to taking weekend day trips to favorite uncrowded places within a couple of hours of home in my own car and with my own food. There is much more open space here upstate so easier to do that than in NYC."

"#57 Mike - If you are going to quote me, please do so accurately. I didn't say there was a large spike of cases, I said that cases have started to rise again in my area after they were down to very few. I also didn't say that we have a spike in hospitalizations or deaths, though my county had 0 hospitalizations in early July and we now have 4. To someone used to city numbers it probably doesn't sound like much, but for our area it is. (I live in northern NY where the cows outnumber the people)In the last 12 days of June we had a total of 2 new cases in the county. In the last 22 days, we have 31 new cases, so yes, our numbers are rising. My source for the mode of transmission was the Public Health Department stated that 7 of 8 new cases over a few days in early July were related to travel out of the area. Not all cases are from travel but that seemed to be the initial cause of an uptick per public health.Edited: 5:48 pm, July 28, 2020 "
#77 georgeI read your post and nowhere did you say there was a large spike. You wrote there was an increase. English was one of my favorite subjects in school. My teacher was very good.
# 58 risaI find those who resort to name calling are incapable of having an adult conversation. Where did I put my Swedish fish???

#76 Very good point. I see nothing offensive in your post. I saw nothing offensive in my post asking where in the US Toronto is but twice when I posted asking that it was offending to some. Some like to learn and some like to teach and preach and have posts removed. Sad.
"#69 kayeIt is my understanding essential workers do not have the option to stay home aside from quitting their job. My relative in a meat packing plant was told he had to go to work. He asked for testing but that was denied. Strange because the people who declared him and his coworkers ""essential"" get tested daily and multiple times daily but the blue collar workers who are essential were not tested because they had no symptoms, which applies to those who deemed them essential.While I live in a state that allows me to travel/visit to NYC, I take a responsible view to protect myself and others. I do not need to find bars in NY violating the governors regulations so i can drink. In words and actions I believe and follow laws. I am not selfish."
"On another post, a visitor was asking about travel in September. Out of curiosity, I checked to see what the travel restrictions and requirements are for that poster's country of origin. A negative test within 96 hours is required. While we are being told that there are enough tests for NYers right now, the delay for results has stretched to ten days, because of the amount of people being tested. I would go bananas if I heard that foreigners were now getting tests in NY so that they could return home without quarantining, regardless of whether it is legal to travel or not. We simply do not have this under control yet, certainly not enough for travelers from overseas to burden our health care system. As far as Americans, I'm for respecting the burdens on our system. That's my view. Reasonable minds will differ, but from where I sit, my neighborhood is crowded and already struggling to meet the needs of the people who live there. We need to stabilize a bit further. But if someone plans to come, please follow rules about wearing a mask if you come within 6 feet of anyone else."
"#83 I read or heard somewhere that one of the reasons for the sharp increase in turnaround time was the sharp increase in the number of people needing tests for reasons other than being sick or possibly having been exposed to the virus -- that is, people who need it to travel (whether locals or visitors), for work, school and other things. When we were tightly locked down people didn't have those other needs because nobody was going anywhere.I also heard that a lot of the delays were for tests done by the urgent care center CitiMD (and the lab they use, in NJ). There is a CitiMD not far from me and a block or two away is another urgent care, Med-Rite. I have noticed a couple times recently when walking by a long line of people waiting to get into Med-Rite, but nobody outside CitiMD. So the word must have gotten out."
You’re absolutely right we should hold our horses for some time.
"Obviously, I won't be visiting this year. And at this point, I'd be surprised if it might be possible next year ... I hope I'm wrong on the latter account though."
"I hope we’re wrong Maxi, hope you can come soon."
"I've been visiting twice a year, for a month each time for last five years. I'm hooked on NYC! Last there in Feb and left just before lockdown. Can't imagine not being there til late 2021. What a year!"
"As this year progresses I think many of us who were planning to visit NYC this year have realised (if we have any sense) that it is not going to happen. We were due to visit for a week in early November and have made the sad, but right, decision to cancel our trip. Hotel has been refunded and flight credited for travel at some point over the next year. It’s a horrible decision to make, we love visiting New York but watching events unfold all over the world we realise it would just be silly to travel abroad this year. Staying local instead and visiting some areas of Scotland we’ve never been to before.We can’t wait to be back in NYC later on in 2021 though!"
"I was supposed to be in New York this very weekend. I was planning to see my nephew in New Jersey while there. Now I do not know when I will be able to see him again. And that is making me sad. But I am a firm believer that people need to stop traveling to help get this under control, so even aside from the quarantine stuff, I’m not traveling."
