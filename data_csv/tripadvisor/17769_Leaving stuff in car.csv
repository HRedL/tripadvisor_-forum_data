"Quick question...hubby and I are planning on taking our rental car to St. John for a day. We have always taken my good camera along with our beach stuff when we tour places. When we are out snorkeling would you say St. John is safe enough to leave the good camera, phone, etc in the trunk of the car? I have read on here how rental cars have been broken into and to leave nothing inside the car BUT really? I would hate to miss out on some great photos because I can't take my good camera?"
I wouldn't advise you to do so. If I were you I would look on line for a dive bag which can carry your valuables. Really. We don't need your trip report hinging primarily on how you lost your stuff! when your rental vehicle was broken into!
Are the break-in's really that bad? We have always felt safe in all the other carribean islands we have traveled and have just left the camera in the trunk where no one can see it.
"Others may feel differently but my answer isn't going to change however many times the question's rephrased! Rental vehicle break-ins aren't epidemic but yes, they happen on both St Thomas and St John. Better safe than sorry. Enjoy a great vacation!"
"Have not heard of a problem in the VI, have heard you can't leave anything in the car trunk on St. Martin/St. Maarten."
"There was a relevant post just recently on this forum and there have been several over the years. No doubt thousands of visitors rent vehicles here every year and leave valuables in the locked trunk or the glove compartment and have no problem whatsoever. I'd rather prefer to give the cautionary and time-worn advice not do so and leave the car unlocked, rather than read how a visitor's rental had its windows smashed in and everything removed from it. That doesn't make for a happy vacation ..."
"""I would hate to miss out on some great photos because I can't take my good camera?""Had me thinking ""So why leave the camera in the trunk?""STT's advice was prudent. Five years ago I witnessed the results of a trunk break in at a remote parking area at a beach trail-head in St John. Thief used a lock puller and it was clearly going to be an expensive repair. Your follow up question ""Is it really that bad in St. J?"" if posed to the victim of that break-in would likely elicit a resounding ""Heck yea!"". Personally I don't use property crime as a measure of safety otherwise I'd feel unsafe in my own neighborhood since I one had a bicycle stolen and on another occasion found my car pilfered. Smash & grab is a common approach - I never leave valuables visible or blankets/towels strategically placed. Modern cars are equipped with remote trunk latches so it only takes a moment for a thief to have a look-see; no lock puller needed - the break-in tool is the nearest rock. Tina mentions St. M and I'll add Bonaire to the mix. Every beach parking area had lots of shattered window glass littering the ground. One might think it's practically a local sport. The advice there is to not even lock your car and leave your windows down enough so the thieves don't even consider breaking your window. Leave it in the trunk only if you are willing to take the risk; reassurances from the forum community will not lessen them."
Ok...I have been convinced. I will not be taking my good cannon camera when we go to St. John :( We will have to have photos from our underwater camera to document our travels. I did buy another dry pouch today on amazon to carry when snorkeling. I also bought a second camera today at Costco that goes both in the water and out so hopefully it will make for some decent pictures and I will be able to have ALL my belongings on me at all times. It makes me sad that the world has come to this but it is what it is and I would rather not have the stress of having our car broken in to.
Same advice goes for St Thomas too! Just wanted to clarify that. Have a great time!
"We'd never leave valuable things in the vehicle. STJ is relatively safe but break-ins do happen. A car is such easy pickings. We just leave our stuff on the beach. I have an old, worn day pack that I use for the beach. Somebody could grab it but it's not very tempting. We've never had a problem and I don't worry about it. If I worried about it, I'd have to come up with a different plan. One thing you could do is take both cameras with you, use the less expensive when it's going to be left unattended, keep the other back in your safe. Then schedule periods just for going out photographing and use the better camera."
"Aside from the ""break-in"" problem, it is probably never a good idea to leave a camera in a car. It can get awfully hot or cold in a car, and temperature extremes are definitely bad for cameras. I'm willing to bet that if you read the camera's instruction manual, the practice is strongly discouraged."
"I'll just chime in and add that this is not an issue unique to St. Thomas or the Caribbean. It happens at the mall near my house in the Chicago suburbs and is a frequent topic on the Hawaii boards as car break ins are common at remote locations in Hawaii as well. It's a crime of opportunity and why offer an opportunity? Its also not new, when my husband and I first visited Hawaii in 1999 we were told that one of the beaches is called ""robin hood beach"" because so many tourists were robbed while they were in the water and left their belongings in their car or out in the sand."
"Part of the ""smash"" problem is that the various jurisdictions require that car windows be made of materials that are very easy to smash."
"Nothing to do with ""local jurisdictions"", Stave, but everything to do with standard/universal manufacturing practices/laws and shatter-proof glass."
"OK, by ""local jurisdictions"", I meant ""below the federal level""For example, certain types of glass are required by New York State.As I recall, the standards for the glass are set by the DOT, but the actual legal requirement that it be used in order for the car to be registered in NYS, is in NYS, not federal, law.Also, some ""jurisdictions"" prohibit the use of glass, but here I am stretching the use of the word to include what may be termed ""private jurisdictions"".It's just another example of the law being behind the times.Steve"
Right.
