"Hi everyone, we are due in a four weeks to go to Cabo. I called expedia and asked what happens if I cancel, just in case... They said my hotel and many others,just waived the cancellation fee, and some airlines also did this. CDC said dont go to mexico if you dont have to... is anyone else like us...wants to go but not feeling safe??? a few weeks ago, I just worried about taking my laptop or not... not thinking about my life..  I dont want my kids to get sick in mexico. here, i feel safer if we get safe..not there. we are probably going to cancel the trip. too much stress now... oh how we looked forward :( how is everyone else doing with their trips coming on? anyone with kids still going on with plans? "
"Lots of threads on this already--search them. However, school has now been cancelled throughout the Republic of Mexico. "
We are in the same situation with kids traveling with us. My wife is very leary with all the talks about the swine flu. We have a 9 month coming with us and 6 yr old. Our flight is in 2 weeks and dont rally know what to do but wait to see what is said through the CDC. We are torn on what to do. We are leaning on still going but be really cautious.STRESSFULL!!!!
I'm waiting until closer to my trip to make a decision. I'm thankful I'm not scheduled to leave this week.
"I'd wait a few more days.I wouldn't worry about the kids. The biggest fear with pandemic is that most vulnerable are not little kids and the old, but 20-45 year olds. The kids who've come out of Mexico have mostly had mild cases.This could end up being a really big deal, a true pandemic, OR, it could turn out to be not such a big deal.Only a little more time will tell. Four weeks in this situation if a very, very long time."
"I agree with Baja. I'm suppose to go in June, with kids, but will wait to see how this pans out. Also, I think people need to remember that if you go and do get the flu, you are not just risking your own health but the health of those you might infect on your return home. It might be a mild case for you, but not for the guy you sneeze on at the airport or the other kids in your child's class at school. My daughter has asthma and this type of flu could be pretty bad for her. I would hate to take her down there and have her get sick and then risk infecting her classmates etc...and spreading this to the city I live in! I'd feel pretty crappy."
"My husband and I have decided to go ahead with our plans. As I already stated, with all the precautions Mexico is now taking, it'll be safer down there than it is right here in Chicago. WE will also be overly careful and try just to stay in the resort."
You really think you are safer in Mexico than Chicago?
"hi i live in england, all holidays and flights cancelled.they are unable to control it its at level 4, it is turning into an epidemic. totaly out of controll"
"tracy, they concluded days ago that there was no containing it as it had already spread. That in and of itself is not so terrible. A flu spreading without being a serious flu is not so terrible.What would be terrible is if this pans out to make people unusually sick.So far, so good, though CDC says the population sampling is too small so far to know how virulent it is.My point, Tracey, is this is not the Bubonic plague spreading...simply a flu spreading that has POTENTIAL to be very serious.WHO and CDC, so far, have simply been acting out of caution."
"We have a trip planned for early June. We also have a wedding to be at in Oklahoma. To get there we are flying into Kansas, which has 2 cases. Many people from Texas will be attending, also confirmed cases. I am all for going to Cabo. I think it is funny that some think we should cancel the Mexico portion but no one seems to think that we should skip the wedding….. It is all perspective. To me it has been way blown out of proportion to real risk we face each day."
"We are also scheduled for Cabo in July, with kids (12 and 10.) I really think everyone should just wait and see and not to panic. I'm hoping by the time we go, everything will be settled down and figured out. I think if you really take the necessary precautions, i.e., hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes and try to avoid others doing the same, you should be okay. I also see that most cases are with adults from in their 20's to the 40s. Honestly, I think it will be okay. Everyone just needs to calm down a little. I believe there is nothing reported in Cabo, at this time. Hopefully, everything works out for you and your family. Happy travels."
San Diego...I think you are right to wait and see. I heard today that they do not know why it is not as fatal with Americans as it is with Mexicans. I don't know what i would do if I had little kids. Sometimes the media does blow everything out of proportion...so just wait. We went when everyone was telling us we were going to be killed in a drug war!We just got back from Cabo and now my husband thinks we should go back again since there will be great deals!
"Eli11, you have more exposure to Swine Flu in Missouri than you do in Cabo, where the nearest case is 1,000 miles away. Remember, there are confirmed cases right next door in Kansas, there are no reported cases, let alone confirmed, anywhere near Cabo.maps.google.com/maps/ms…"
"stubby...you point out the 64 million dollar question: why the reported high mortality rate among healthy, young adults in Mexico?There are a number of explanations and figuring out what is what, is the goal right now. Only time and examination of the facts will tell us what we are dealing with. (maybe reporting in Mexico was sloppy, maybe since most of the US cases were not in the ""healthy young adult"" category the mildness is irrelevant, maybe statistically you need more than 64 confirmed cases to see what is what, etc....)"
Latest from WHO:…yahoo.com/s/…us_flu_who_spanish_3
Now 64 confirmed cases in the USA vs. still only 26 confirmed cases in Mexico.
"I have not kept on top of situation, but is it 64 confirmed FATALITIES in US. What I heard earlier is US cases are not fatal compared to Mexico. My husband thinks we need to go back since we could probably get a deal...I wish I could. I do hope all get well quickly."
There are no fatalities in the US.
"64 cases, 0 fatalaties in the USA, 26 cases, 7 fatalaties in Mexicowww.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_28/en/index.html"
"Oops...didn't see the news this morning.64 cases, 1 fatal in the USA, 26 cases, 7 fatal in Mexico (none still in Cabo, even reported)."
"We are scheduled to leave on May 19th with our 3 year old. We are taking the 'wait and see' approach. If it were just my husband and I there would be no question, but I do worry about my son.I truly think much of this is media hype and simple, safe hygeine is the way to go. however 'good hygeine and three yo"" often don't mix:( We are headed to Isla via Cancun - another concern.I say just hang tight over the next couple weeks to see what happens...."

"I'm due to go to Los Cabos in 8 weeks with my 2 kids. I'm waiting to see how the whole Swine Flu thing develops, but I checked some maps showing the outbreaks and I found it interesting that I'm MUCH closer to the danger here in NY (45 Minutes North of Queens) than if I were in Cabo. There are NO reported cases on the Baja pennisula as of yet."
I agree with you Pegasus - I am more worried about the plane ride!
"Hey, I'm leaving for Cabo this Friday, It'll be good to get away from all this Sine flu media Hype."
"Oops! ""Swine"". "
"We are scheduled to go to Cabo (10 of us) June 8-15 at HDM and I think the only way we are cancelling is if they cancel our flights. We have made backup plans to go on an alaskan cruise just in case. I just got over a 4 day horrible flu that laid me flat on my back. From all of the reports of this swine flu, the sickness that I had doesn't even seem to compare to the mild symptoms of the swine flu. I am way more worried about being in an airport than in Cabo. Good luck to all of you going soon, give us some great trip reports! "
"I currently work for an environmental company and deal on a day to day basis with government agencies throughout the world.I contacted a close friend that works with the health department in Mexico and he advises the following;1. The Swine Flu Virus can only be tested currently in two laboratories. Once is currently located in Atlanta and the other in Canada. As of today April 29, 2009. The confirmed actual swine flu count in Mexico is 25 infected and 7 deaths. The 7 deaths were the first people that were contaminated and did not seek proper medical help.2. The government in Mexico also has made a bigger mistake by providing the fase mask to citizen and not explaining proper procautions. Such as, the face mask must be changed ever so often couple of hours otherwise you are just breathing in the collected bacteria and germs.3. The Swine Flu is only transmitted by having direct contact with the virus such as the normal flu and it is completely treatable. Instead of being so paniced about Mexico, we need to have more of a precaution with the airports. My contact advise that Cabo is located 4hours from Mexico City and it is very isolated from the mainland. You can only get there by airplane or boat since it is basically a three day drive on car from Mexico city To Cabo.If you google the swine, it has been around prior and is not something new. Asia had the first cases of it. The best advise has been to wash your hands and face and try no to come in contact with someone who looks ill. Like we would on a day to day basis."
"In my opinion, anything can happen anywhere. We had a drop by shooting in my block one of the bullets went thru the window crossing the whole house and hitting the neighbor on the other side of the fence killing him instantly. I have family in several parts of Mexico and I called just to check on them to make sure they were OK, they said that everything gets blown out of proportion by the media, yes schools have been canceled for the next couple of weeks, but that’s IT, there is only a hand full of people wearing the masks. I am sure that if someone has it you will notice, especially if it is that deadly. We are talking about 79 cases WORLDWIDE. Do you consider your self that lucky?"
