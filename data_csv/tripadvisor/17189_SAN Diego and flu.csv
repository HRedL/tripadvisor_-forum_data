Anybody been to SAN Diego lately? I hear the flu may be an epidemic there and wondering if we should cancel our trip? Thanks!
"Hi,It is not any more of an ""epidemic"" than anywhere else.I have not heard of anyone canceling a trip because of it."
Just want to add that we had the flu about 1month ago(after also having the flu shot) .None of our friends are sick now so perhaps that is old news???
The flu is in the news this winter everywhere I've been or read about.Are the experts really calling it an epidemic.
"No, don't cancel your trip. I wouldn't worry about it. The flu season this year in the U.S. has been very serious. About 700 people so far have died. Apparently, the flu vaccine has been very ineffective this season. HTH"
Is this the Aussie flu? Pretty serious in the UK now.
"Here in the USA we just call it ""the flu"". It is not designated as the ""Aussie flu"" but probably the same thing."
Use the CDC website to get current information about the current influenza outbreak as well as the strain of influenza virus that is causing it.https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm
if you are a reasonably healthy person then why worry. just practice extra hygene like washing your hands before you eat
"Riff, I read a few articles calling it the ""Aussie"" flu, because of origins or connections of the specific strain causing the worst problems (just as previous bad flus were the Hong Kong flu, Spanish flu, bird flu etc). But basically, unless Melissa is from someplace in the world where nobody ever gets sick, I doubt she and her family are at any greater risk in San Diego than back home."
"I also wonder where Melissa is from?? The flu is in most of the USA and is in other countries too so not sure why San Diego would be any different than those cities. I have seen an occasional article saying ""Aussie flu"" but it is not in common usage here by the average person or anyone on the news.The info I just saw on tv says this flu can be spread just by breathing so just washing hands is not enough to keep yourself safe but of course it can't hurt!"
"The handwashing thing is for the usual reasons - we tend to touch something (that's been contaminated) and later touch our eyes, nose etc - then we get sick. But again - that plus the airborne germs are how influenza spreads everywhere."
"I have a sister who works in one of the San Diego hospitals, in the in patient pharmacy. She has not mentioned anything at all like an outbreak or epidemic.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hand-washing PLUS face-mask has been shown to reduce catching flu from household members. I am planning to bring a face mask along on my upcoming flight in case anyone sitting near me is coughing (though I realize people are contagious at least a day before they start feeling ill, and for some time after, as well - that's why it spreads so easily). Might be overkill, but trying not to ruin my vacation!"
