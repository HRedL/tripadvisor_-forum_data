Thank you AtomicbuhdaWe will look into the Casabar celebrations..sounds like fun!Happy 4th of July!
I like the look of the web site! Hope their hamburgers are better than those served at the other American expat bar. I ate there on July 4 a couple of years ago....All things considered I prefer anchuras. :)
"Just in case celebrations are shut down due to the flu...Here is a bit of patriotic good cheer, sure to stir the hearts of all Americanos....(oh, and I think the black and white singer in the background looks a lot like your president's husband..your former president)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDA9NbPAK8oHappy July 4th. "
"Independence Day, July 4th, has been celebrated by Americans for centuries. It is observed by U.S. citizens in America, wherever they live and wherever they travel. I don´t understand why someone would say ""we celebrate July 9th, now."" The announcement that an American Celebration was cancelled because of a health scare had nothing to due with an Argen-tine holiday. I am very offended by this person´s remark. "
"Relax, it looks like it was just an attempt at humor. This stupid flu is ruining everyone's fun and onda. Everyone have fun today! "
