The PR Health Dept. reported that a 16 year old girl was infected with the mosquito-borne virus. She lives in the Rio Piedras section of San Juan. I hope this does not become an epidemic.Edited: 6 years ago 
"Do you have a link to the original message?If this was a local transmission, you have to assume that the virus is already in the local mosquito population. Once this has happened, there is no way to stop the spread anymore with the usual methods."
"No details were given regarding method of transmission. She is at home, did not need to be hospitalized. The virus is now in the Caribbean. Nothing to do except take the usual precautions regarding mosquito bites. Locals do not wear any bug repellent on a regular basis, so visitors do not need to obsess about it either."
