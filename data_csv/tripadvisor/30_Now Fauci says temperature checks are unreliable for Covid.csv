I'm beginning to not believe anything this clown has to say.https:/…And they call this science ? What a load of useless garbage these people put out.
He has been contradicting himself left and right. I think him not wearing a mask at the MLB season opener really showed what a big fraud he is.
"Of course they don't work, and of course this guy is an idiot. He saw the same data the President did and told healthy young people to go on cruise ships 4 days before the national emergency declaration. If there is an economic collapse in this country it will be because of him. If there is a civil war he added fuel to the fire."
"Part of the reason the pandemic is so bad in the US is because people who are never involved in the science methods are seeing science unfold in real time.Errors, evidence and changing methodology happen 100% of the time.But in the public eye, it’s seen as “ they don’t know what they’re talking about”.(Credit: Some random guy on Facebook lol)"
So I guess they can stop checking everyone's temperature when they enter a casino or hotel now.
"Temp checks have never been a reliable method....never understood the desire to do them. in our facility, the only positive cases reported so far were all asymptomatic, we could have checked their temperatures hourly and never would have known they were positive cases."

"COVID-19 is very similar to SARS. While our understanding of things with regards to a virus will of course change overtime, there are usually things that immutable when dealing with a specific family of viruses, especially a family of viruses so common and studied like coronaviruses. We know how they act, how they spread, and what does or doesn't work. With regards to a viral outbreak things aren't 0-100 in a week. That is basically how quickly the ""experts"" and media changed their minds. If this was a terrorist attack, war, an unknown object from space on a collision course with Earth, that is a different story. COVID-19, SARS, MERS, the common cold are all well known. Hydroxychloroquine works against SARS, which is why it works agains C-19. Masks don't work against respiratory infections which is why they were never recommended for decades. People are trusting what is effectively a career government worker with their health. He hasn't seen a patient in person since his residency decades ago. It's like a CEO who runs a department store and who completely forgot what it was like to work in one and actually deal with front line employees and customers. Everything is theoretical to him, there is no understanding of patient needs/desires only numbers. A good doctor looks at the data and works with a patient to provide treatment that not only saves them but provides a good quality of life as well. If the USA were a patient, it would be suffering from a bad flu and this guy is basically locking it down in an ICU and giving it nothing but chemo treatments. That is how ridiculous Fauci is. What kind of lives do we have now? Barring those that live in a few free states, pretty terrible."
"Saw that news last night, had to rewind and made sure I didn’t hear it wrong. I like this cute little Fauci guy, but don’t forget, he is the man in charge of this virus, everything messed up during his watch. It’s his fault too."
"Right. We don’t need medical researchers and other experts who don’t see patients.We just need Marcus Welby, MD."
"Besides that, he throws a baseball like a girl....."

"One of those people is his wife.Dr. Fauci’s response to this “ controversy “, credit Fox News:“ The other person is a very close friend of mine. John, I think this is sort of mischievous with this thing going around. I had my mask around my chin, I had taken it down. I was totally dehydrated and I was drinking water trying to rehydrate myself. And by the way, I was negative Covid literally the day before.So I guess if people want to make a thing of that, I wear a mask all the time when I’m outside. To pull it down, to take some sips of water, and put it back up again, I guess if people want to make something about that, they can. But to me, I think that’s just mischievous.”"

"It's a new bug / novel pathogen..we were all Covid ignorant in the early stages. We had no succinct blueprint to refer to when attempting to deal with it. Most individuals, me, the media, groups, government institutions and reps, POTUS,...most everybody..made ( and are still making) mistakes, including Fauci. Sometimes the most intelligent and honest humans are those who say "" I don't know""..this entire scenario is and has been a trial and error/ crap shoot situation in many respects, and has been flanked by a plethora of misinformation, lies, and misguided assumptions from all sides and often fueled by politics. Kinda shameful.Humanity is fallible ..we've sure been exposed to that fact during this pandemic. With time's help, there will be an end to this crap..even for Fauci and other public figures who are forced to respond to questions when they don't really know the answer half the time. Nature / biology is a tough opponent..it's been kicking humanity's ass for a long time in numerous ways. It's amazing that we sometimes have discovered methods to work with it instead of against it..accomplished things, etc.Currently, I'm more concerned about a booked Vegas trip next month..beer, blackjack, good greasy food,etc. ( while paying attention to those around us and the 'rules', yes)."
"The other guy was a colleague. And it doesn't matter what the test says, he could have been infected at that moment. So could his friend. The man has been caught on tape taking his mask off wrong when he thinks the cameras aren't looking and then walking away, this is inside a building. He doesn't believe the crap he spews out of his mouth and is a hypocrite. It's like the USSR and the party elite. Comrade Fauci gets to go to a baseball game with people he chooses, gets to not wear a mask, and no consequences. I wish I could tell that little man what a worthless pile he is to his face. I wonder how much money I'd have to donate to Trump's campaign to where he'd let me be the one to notify Fauci he is finally fired? Whatever it is, it would be worth it."

"It's reported that a person's body temperature is lower in the morning than it is in the evening; that's more uncertainty on this detection practice.Not strictly relevant, but Las Vegas daytime high temperatures for the next week are forecast 112-113 degrees. Not so much a temperature issue, but a lot more people taking shelter in the air-conditioned casinos, and social distancing may be compromised, especially this weekend."

I totally agree with post 45.

A new topic of what’s your lucky number might be popular. You do it.
"Basic common sense should have you knowing that there are asymptomatic carriers with no symptoms at all, including running a fever. The top infectious disease doctor in the country shouldnt have to tell people that temp checks are not a reliable source to find covid, people should be able to put 2 and 2 together. That's the whole reason there is a mask mandate, to help the spread from the asymptomatic carriers. The rest with symptoms should be quarantine from others. It's not to difficult to figure out if u put some thought into it."

I totally disagree with post 59 which totally agrees with post 45 which oh never mind
"is t dawg okay?why is his page ""on vacation""??does it have anything to do with 13???"
When did Dr Fauci ever say that temperature checks were reliable and recommended?
You may disagree with the science but arguing against the math is ridiculous. If we assume 300 million people in the U.S. and it takes 60% for herd immunity then 180 million Americans would get it. Assuming a 1% fatality rate then 1.8 million Americans would die. If you are okay with these numbers then you have other mental issues that need to be addressed.....
"Did Fauci ever say that temp checks were reliable? I mean, they’ve been reiterating the dangers of asymptomatic spread since the pandemic became, well, a pandemic. They are totally pointless and only in place to give the illusion of safety, but you’ve got to be an idiot to believe in the efficacy of them."
"No he didn't and he also has not been ""contradicting himself left and right"". Scientific advice changes when new data comes in. That's not ""contradiction"", it's updated advice."

"I wonder if there are experts keeping track and compare Las Vegas to California? Las Vegas open for business vs California Still shutdown. Is California doing better than Las Vegas?

"Mac,Not sure.When this all sorts out, if there is a post-mortum, it will be interesting to see who did things correctly, and who did not.Now, we do know that Gov Cuomo was 100% correct, as his personal investigation of Covid, and nursing homes was settled, with no other investigation, beyond his own.When the truth IS known, things may well differ, and all need to step up, and take full responsibility.Hunt"
"Airlines and casinos are only checking temperatures, requiring masks, etc. so they can show they're doing ""all they can do"" in order to keep operating -- errr, ""keep everyone safe."". Who can blame them?"
California is not shut down. I think hair salons and gyms are still closed. And bars that don't serve food. Parts of Los Angeles County recently re-shuttered retail shopping.
"I am in California, it is pretty much shut and closed. Same for 6 months. The difference is some of us sort of find ways to go on, human nature, we find ways to survive, “Improvise, Adapt, and Overcome”. I have been 100% obedient, but at some point, one wonders if we shutdown for 6 months with no obvious benefit or minimum effects, what seemed logical and reasonable maybe was not the correct approach. They killed the economy and livelihoods of 100 million people, for what? Reasonable doubt. We trusted people with expertise, knowledge and authorities to deliver results, what are the results?There must be smarter people out there."
"Hair salons in California have reopened this week, or at least for my part of San Francisco Bay Area.its an odd site though as they do hair, nails, outside - such as on the sidewalk area or on the parking lot.Yes, all of this will be interesting if there is ever a review of what went right and what went wrong.Not sure why we are not hearing from others other than Fauci - he seems to have set himself up as a dictator of what our lives must look like. A biography of his life may prove he is just angry. Or he might be right. Who knows at this point."
"Same thing happen in businesses and military, you do the same things same ways for years or decades, no one questioned it, no one think about it or dare to speak out. History repeats itself again and again. Then one day somebody asked why? How about let’s try a new approach? If we are lucky, message gets through, we may have a paradigm shift of complete new ways to look at and handle things.The person speaking out doesn’t need to be the person with answer. The best way to kill new idea is to demand answer from the person speaking up,I am not smart enough to have answers, but there must be better ways, because it ain’t working."

"Temperature was only one of many indicators of a potential COVID-19 case. Fauci was saying that when the weather temperature is hot during the summer, have a high body temperature is no longer a reliable indicator.""Especially on hot summer days, temperature checks aren't a reliable way to screen for infection, Fauci said""...""Fauci added that in recent days his temperature read as high as 103 degrees before getting into the air conditioning.""When the outside temperature was cold, someone coming in with 103 degree would mean something may be wrong. Sounds simple, no?."
"I used to believe everything he said, you know, because he's supposed to help us. However, after seeing him wear no mask in public on a couple of occasions, it's only natural to realize something isn't right. 13"

"@MacWe trust the ""experts"" to run the economy yet as a nation are tens of trillions in debt, more if you count unfunded pension and social security liabilities. In CA every single summer there are rolling blackouts due to not enough power generating capacity. In many years we have droughts, yet the ""experts"" refuse to do things that would help such as building extra water storage capacity, desalination plants, etc. The ""experts"" might have that title, they might have been in their fields for a long time, that doesn't mean they are any good. You are a businessman, I'm sure you've had to deal with people who had decades of experience yet made mistake after mistake? I've been 100% not obedient re the virus. Yet both of us are in the same position health wise. Honestly Mac, if COVID-19 was as virulent as the ""experts"" claim, do you honestly think I should still be alive, or at the very least be healthy? The news loves to trot out stories of virus victims who thought like me yet played by the rules and took one step outside to a bar and got sick. We live in a country of 320,000,000. The law of averages at this point means that there will be people who shouldn't have complications or die but do. But as far as we know every regular poster on here is still healthy."
"@MiniThere are other medical professionals out there that recommend different things than Fauci. However, the media immediately jumps on them as being wrong. 1,000 doctors sent a letter to the President a few months ago stating they believed the lockdowns were wrong. Now out of that list, some think masks are helpful, some think they don't do anything beneficial, some think they cause more harm. People within a field can all have their own opinion. Some doctors treat a problem one way, others another based on their experience, their knowledge, and what they or their patient thinks is best. Unfortunately, data is very easily to manipulate and the general public is too content to simply believe anything the media tells them, wrong as it might be."

"USA twinned with UK...same here...Masks are no use then its masks must be worn. High temp equals Covid19 then high temp doesn't. It can live for a week on cardboard then it cant.... you get the picture. Just one lot of unsubstantiated clap trap after another, often from experts who are self titled and have a vested interest in the publicity each and every pronouncement affords them."
"Seatbelts shouldn't be mandatory for adults. That being said they actually do have a benefit. There was a recent study done in LA where it showed that in grocery stores how many things were contaminated with the virus. Remember, this is LA with a mandatory mask mandate where all employees and customers wear them while shopping. So what happened? Like anything science is a business. If people don't feel they need you, you go out of business."

"Grocery stores have a lot of contaminations even when many wear masks. Most likely transmission from hands that's got germs and not from viruses escaped from mask wearing public(the 3 W's, remember? Wear mask, wash hands, watch distance).We all need to do the best we can under this pandemic. Never going to be 100% perfection. It's a crude analogy that toilet harbors lots of germs anyway, so why bother to clean it periodically?One wants to err on the side of prudence and not reckless."

“ Like anything science is a business.”Boom! Surgeons sell surgery. Lawyers sell lawsuits. Infectious disease scientists sell whatever people and the media will obsess over. Fauci and people like him stand to make huge sums from this disease on the chicken dinner circuit alone.
"“Same folks who thought covid 19 would go away are now demonizing Dr. Fauci.” - HardTen, serious question for you. What is your take on Fauci since he has been caught in public at least two or three times that I’ve seen video footage without a mask on and socializing with people?As I stated earlier, I was believing everything he said for a long while, until that news started to surface. It doesn’t give you any pause at all to at least think something is fishy with that?Honest question, just wanting a different perspective. 13"
"ttumaddawg. Glad you want a different perspective. Science evolves, things change, lives that were lost in New York during the early days of the pandemic are now saved. Dr Fauci is trusted by 70% of the American people in contrast to donald. That is why the blue wave will be huge and overwhelming in November. In spite of the obvious and transparent events unfolding before our eyes, such as defunding post office or removing voting boxes, also known as voter suppression. Will not work. During 2018 mid terms Dems received 8 million more votes, even the electoral college will not save teflon don this time."

Fauci needs to retire.
"Faucci simply stating the fact that temperature check is not the most reliable way to detect infected just the same as current diagnostic tests--Molecular test (PCR) and antigen test AND antibody test can also have false results.But why is the whole world using this method? As imperfect as it is, it is a cheap, easy to use screening tool by almost anyone (business, office, public places, airport etc) without special training. It's similar to most places nowadays (like doctors office) that ask questions like travel history, personal contact with known COVID person, feeling of unwell recently. They are not meant to diagnose accurately as many know the system can be gamed (taking anti fever meds like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can lower body temp to fool thermo scanner or thermometer) OR lying to the screening person's questions.In the case of WH or NIH they already have in place frequent testings that temperature check became a less important tool to use.Science is ever evolving and I can't see majority of mainstream medical experts are lying to the public intentionally for personal gains or with a dark motive.Edited: 3:22 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"There are many doctors who disagree with Fauci, they are demonized and smeared. Others simply feel perhaps it is best to defer to the people at the CDC or WHO as surely they would know best. Not that it is the case. Question is again, if masks work, why are your hands contaminated? They shouldn't be."
"Swing and miss by hard ten.If forced to choose between the post office or police department, which would you defund. Now answer that with your vote and we'll see if there is a wave."
"Interesting article regarding why we are at this stage, months after pandemic began:https://www.google.com/url…"
"""Question is again, if masks work, why are your hands contaminated? They shouldn't be""The 3 w's again.. High touch areas in public places like grocery stores. People use hands to touch. Masks only minimize droplet and aerosol transmission through nose and mouth. Again, not virus particle penetration itself (too small except N95, which is 95% effective). That's why WASH hands often when touching things in public and your own mask if you touch them."

"“Sometimes I think the powers-that-be enjoy spewing out ridiculous facts and rules just to see if we will listen. And of course, the majority of people will listen.”Substitute comply for listen."
"From #140“There have been patients who where in ICU and were given hydroxychloroquine and I remember one patient said , it saved his life and doctors agreed.”Really? That’s awesome!Too bad the many more patients who were in ICU and given hydroxychloroquine, but died, are intentionally being overlooked here. Those agreeable doctors, given the chance to comment without being attacked, would probably agree with that as well. Just saying!"
I appreciate that...thank you!
"So if you have a cold, and you stay home and rest for three days, and you drink plenty of fluids, and you take extra vitamin C, and you eat chicken soup daily, and you swallow a zinc tab daily, and you take a garlic supplement and hot steamy showers and you drink apple cider vinegar and drink lemon tea.......then when you recover, you and your doctor can just claim it was the Vitamin C Zinc combination that ""cured"" you? Even though 99% of people recover from a cold on day 4 anyway?"
This thread averages 71 for an IQ
"“ wisconsin business just told their employees to wear a mask while on Zoom, even if home alone!!! ”Well...not really. There’s no mention of “ alone” or “ not alone” in the direction given to employees. And it wasn’t a business. It was a government agency. And it wasn’t for all Zoom meetings. Just some. And what a great idea. Setting an example.“ Also, wear your mask, even if you are home, to participate in a virtual meeting that involves being seen — such as on Zoom or another video-conferencing platform — by non-DNR staff,” Cole said, according to the Sentinel. “Set the safety example which shows you as a DNR public service employee care about the safety and health of others.”"
So virtue more signaling.
Be a good little comrade.
"Masks are mandated for indoor (and some outdoor) places because there's always a possibility that you won't be able to distance. But requiring employees to wear a mask when 'attending' a meeting from home is (borrowing from placebets!) baloney. Safety (especially in the workplace) is usually determined by a hazard assessment, which, in a home environment, would indicate that potential for viral transmission to others doesn't exist.That mandate is an example of mindless bureaucracy."

"Yeah , sure, it's ridiculous. Ok And every time any one of you watches Dr Fauci or anyone else on tv , you love to hoot and holler and point out that they're not wearing a mask.

"I do advocate on behalf of Dr. Emmanuel. I don't agree with some of her cultural or perhaps spiritual beliefs but then again, I could say that for anyone. She is from Africa and oftentimes Christianity is mixed with more local beliefs/superstitions. I don't have to agree with her exactly to think she is a competent doctor and seems like a good person. I'd happily receive medical treatment from her if she was local to me. It is the other people on this forum who mock her as well as many in the left leaning media. Someone wanted names of other doctors, I provided them. I'd also just as happily see Dr. Barke or Gold. Dr. Barke is relatively close to me so that could be a possibility at some point"

Go ahead and think about that for a while. 13"
"Louie Gohmert, Paul Vallone a Rep. from NYC, State Rep Karen Whitsett from Michigan all were treated with hydroxychloroquine due to becoming infected with COVID-19. All three of them are recovered. There are cities that have safe injection sites for hard drugs and that is okay, but allowing people to work with their doctor and choose the drug that might save their lives if they are infected by COVID-19 isn't okay. Disgusting."
"“A local doctor in my area that I used to see has been treating patients with hydroxy, zinc, and Zithromax since last Fall, and has had zero patients succumb to this virus.”The doctor is treating people without symptoms and don’t have the virus?"
"I've been self-medicating since fall, with ice cream and hot fudge sauce, and have kept the virus at bay. So I'm sticking with it. Oh and I started in the fall because I am psychic. And I know several people who have had success with this ice cream and hot fudge combo, in fact everyone who has tried it."
I honestly don’t see an end with the states. The death rate just keeps climbing and all the people in denial won’t take a vaccine anyway so it won’t end.

"#169 “ here is what a highly regarded doctor from Yale has to say...”Respectfully, the date of that article [May 29, 2020] reported what Dr Harvey Risch had to say 2 1/2 months ago; that’s a lifetime in Covid research! If you click on the same link provided, you will see that on the left side of the page under “Related Links”, the Yale School of Public Health issued a “Statement Regarding Hydroxychloroquine” on July 29, 2020 which reads in part:“Yale-affiliated physicians used HCQ early in the response to COVID-19, but it is only used rarely at present due to evidence that it is ineffective and potentially risky.”Sometimes it’s not “what” they said, but “when“ they said it, that should be considered :)A hypothesis can be triggered by anecdotal observations, but Science and sound medical treatment, that stands the test of time, are based on evidence gathered from ongoing research, and that often takes time to acquire.A certain individual told supporters at a rally in New Hampshire on February 10, 2020 that the virus would be gone by April, claiming that “when temperatures rise, the virus will miraculously go away.” Understandably, many Americans believed him, although he offered no scientific or medical explanation to support his theory at the time. Evidence collected since then shows that that theory has been debunked.More recently, the same individual has been heard claiming that there will be “fewer cases” if you stop testing for Covid. Again, the ongoing accumulation of evidence does not support that claim, yet so many deny the evidence accumulating before their eyes: over 170,000 fellow citizens have died and many more deaths to come :(Along these same lines, I don’t understand why many individuals who reject wearing masks are often the ones who promote the uncontrolled availability and distribution of hydroxychloroquine. I do appreciate that it turned out to be problematic and confusing to be told it was useless for members of the public to wear masks early on. However, as more information about the severe shortages of masks—early in the crisis—emerges, and new evidence becomes available showing if everyone wears a mask in certain situations, that alone can help dramatically decrease the spread of Covid, I don’t understand the ongoing reluctance to adopt a simple measure that can save lives.In this case, being asked to wear a mask is just following basic science; there’s no prerequisite required to hold a degree in rocket science! Why make it so difficult?Edited: 4:11 pm, August 17, 2020 "

"""RUSH: The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz — who is a Democrat — has come out in support; he’s reversed the ban on hydroxychloroquine.""Rather than Rush Limbaugh, here is the order from Gov. Tim Waltz:""On March 27, 2020, I issued Executive Order 20-23, which authorized Minnesota health-related licensing boards to modify licensure requirements during the COVID-19 peacetime emergency. Executive Order 20-23 also authorized the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy to require that prescription drug orders for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine must contain an appropriate diagnosis and be dispensed for no more than 30 days at a time. Although the modification of licensure requirements remains necessary during the pandemic, we no longer need to limit the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine because these medicines have not been proven to be effective treatments for COVID-19 and are no longer in high demand. The authorization for the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy to implement dispensing limitations related to these medicines is no longer necessary and can be rescinded.""Doesn't sound like support to me.https:/…20Final_tcm1055-443548.pdfEdited: 7:40 pm, August 17, 2020 "

"Glepaw... Instead of tearing apart your entire list of part truths let's tackle VA. VA budget increased from 68 billion from when President Obama took office to 144 billion when he left office. Last year in office they threw another 5 billion to hire more staff. President Obama attempted to open public clinics to Vets but was blocked from moscow mitch and GOP. Once donald was in office that changed, which was a great thing. One of President Obama's first actions as president was to sign the new GI Bill, which is historic and great, ask any Veteran. Which means President Obama has done more for Vets than anyone including donald. And do not get me started on trade deals. donald withdrew us from trade deals that took years and included many parties, donald comes along and tears them apart and goes alone. Turned our Farmers into socialists due to his silly tariff war. I could go on but you get the picture."
Glepaw nice list. Trump is the most proactive President in my lifetime. When does he sleep?  What is this fascination with lies that the left has? I’m not aware of any lies just accomplishments.  The most appropriate home for sleepy Joe is an assisted living one. They can have a mock-up of the Oval office in there for him and tell him he won. The empty vessel will be fine.

"“ AOC nominated Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Presidential candidate.Whaaaaat??The “Squad” leader doesn’t even respect her parties’ nomination???This is PURE GOLD.”Actually pure convention procedure. It’s all part of the process .Maybe someone will nominate William Weld at the GOP convention. I don’t know if they use the same processes.Here’s what she had to say afterwards:“ Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ripped NBC for a tweet that noted she ""did not endorse"" 2020 nominee Joe Biden in her 60-second speech at the Democratic National Convention, with the first-term congresswoman calling it ""completely unacceptable, disappointing, and appalling.""""In one of the shortest speeches of the DNC, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did not endorse Joe Biden,"" NBC News said in its original post to the network's more than 7.7 million followers.""This is completely unacceptable, disappointing, and appalling,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in response to her 8.3 million followers. ""The DNC shared the procedural purpose of my remarks to media WELL in advance. @NBC knew what was going to happen & that it was routine.""""You waited several hours to correct your obvious and blatantly misleading tweet. It sparked an enormous amount of hatred and vitriol, & now the misinfo you created is circulating on other networks,"" she added.

"“ In one of the shortest speeches of the DNC, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez did not endorse Joe Biden,”Well, there you have it. That’s not incorrect, she didn’t endorse him, so not sure why you rambled on with quotes from AOC. It is funny to me that she had to blast the media for “misleading,” when they are masters at it, usually for the liberal agenda of course. 13"
"""What else is Joe Biden going to forget or say?"" I know right? He might forget to show us his taxes or forget that he ever met Stormy Daniels, Jeffrey Epstein or his own senior aide Miles Taylor. He might say covfefe or hamberder or ""I'll show you my taxes"" or ""I'm gonna lock Hillary up"". He might say ""they're saying there's a way to maybe inject the disinfectant into the body"" or any one of a number of other crazy things. Don't vote Joe HE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING!!!"

We can't have a man with clear dementia be President nor can we allow a situation where the VP is effectively running the show from day one.

"Since America was great before donald, it will be great after donald is gone and in prison. Let's do the math. Dems received 8 million more votes in the mid terms. My guess that number will climb to 12 million in the general election. Even the electoral college will not save donald this time."

"He Jinli is the name Kamala Harris used on the Chinese language ballots when she was running for San Francisco DA back in 2003.Cultural appropriation at its finest. Just like with Liz Warren and Robert ""Beto"" O'Rourke. Fake it until you make it.Edited: 8:14 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Was He Jinli used as a translation? Was Harris the only candidate not using their birth name? Is this customary for politicians to do?Appreciate your response, just wondering if you are giving all the facts or just cherry picking what works best for your political view."
Bobby Jindal was he culturally appropriating by not using his name? Nikki Hayley is she culturally appropriating as well?Their names are Piyush Jindal & Nimrata Hayley. I only know Kamla Harris as Kamla Harris not some Americanized version name.
“ Beto” was “ Beto” from the time he was a baby. It’s not like he chose a nickname to appeal to a Hispanic demographic the day before he started running for office. Talk about clutching at straws...
pnsfromlaI found an article from 2016(so maybe there have been changes) which states EVERY candidate for political office in San Francisco HAS to have a Chinese name on the ballot under the federal voting rights act which requires ballots and other election info be translated when a significant percentage of voting age citizens speak limited English.Assuming this is all accurate why do you feel the need to single out Kamla Harris using a Chinese name?The stage is yours.

pnsYou avoided every question I asked in 340. You ignored what i posted in 344. The only conclusion one can take is you singled out Kamala Harris.

You are so right. Almost 10 people who eventually tested positive at this company all passed the daily routine temp checks.
I like other cultures just fine Canadian. What I don't like is slimy politicians who pander and lie for votes.
#361“What I don't like is slimy politicians who pander and lie for votes.”Wait...did I miss something? I had gotten the impression you were voting for Trump?
"Creepy and slimy, so perhaps these beauties fit the narrative?I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her.In 2013, talk show host Wendy Williams played a game with Donald and Ivanka, asking them what favorite activities they had in common. Ivanka said, ""Either real estate or golf."" Donald grinned and said, ""Well, I was going to say sex, but I can't relate that to her,"" prompting groans from the audience.""Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father... ,"" Trump said. ""You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody?"" Trump asked. ""And I helped create her. Ivanka, my daughter, Ivanka. She's 6 feet tall, she's got the best body.""Dr Oz show.. Ivanka came out on stage and gave both Oz and her father a kiss. When Oz commented on it, Trump reportedly said that he likes to kiss her ""as often as I can."" Need Tdawg to remind us of Sleepy Joe and his penchant for hugging and caresssing...as oppposed to what the perv president thinks about his daughter"
"@Glepaw""Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father... ,"" Trump said.uhhh....did...uhhh...we just not read that part...cuz that's all sorts of creepy man."
"Glepaw, if the only comment ever made in regards to his daughter was that, that particular comment is just a bit creepy, especially if one makes comments about Biden hugging and caressing...But that comment is one of many"
so...uh....you gonna opine about the quote I copied or we gonna just conveniently ignore that? Just curious.... not to derail from this trainwreck of a post.
"“I come from a very large Catholic Family and a very Affectionate family. My dad always kissed me and my other siblings. My father kissed me all the time since I was a little girl. It’s just how I grew up. My Mom was the same way. It is who we are as a family. So if he wanted to kiss his daughter, I see no problems with that.”I could have written the exact same thing about my own family and parents. However, when I think of my dad, I don’t remember sitting on his lap as a teenager, and I know that when I stopped by to visit them, he never caressed my bottom as he greeted me at the door with a hug and a kiss. Equally important to me, my father treated ALL females with the utmost respect, regardless of their age and whether or not he was related to them. My dad has also passed away, and I too would give anything for one more hug and kiss...I can close my eyes this moment and feel the same sense of security I always felt around him. MY dad was the best :)"
Yikes.
@Glepawwhat does that have to do with you ignoring the creepy comment?
"@cs, that's a normal m.o. for threads like this.I asked why 45 was so insistent on a Covid 19 vaccine by election day if the virus was an overblown hoax that would just disappear? And I then asked who would get the vaccine.With a few exceptions...crickets."
Now we know why the metal slat barrier hasn’t been built....The windbag only hires the best....criminals
"@KittyBecause perception is all that matters. People are dealing with a fear the likes of which they have never experienced before. Even if the vaccine barely did anything just the idea that people are protected would allow them to get back to normal. The virus was here in January, probably November and almost no one cared. It wasn't until the media started the disinformation campaign that the country freaked out. It's like you lived for years with a mole and then decided to look it up on WebMD and now its cancer in your mind. Doesn't make it cancer but you treat it as such."
"“The virus was here in January, probably November and almost no one cared. It wasn't until the media started the disinformation campaign that the country freaked out.”I can’t speak for the USA, but north of the border the “freak out” started mid-February, into early March, as the number of deaths in Italy kept mounting, and was full on by mid-March as deaths started being recorded NYC in addition to those that had already occurred in Washington State."
"Continuing on from #377Our 3 levels of government (federal, provincial and local) may have been a bit out of sync in the beginning, but from mid-March onward they have worked together to ensure our safety, economic stability, and our peace of mind—in as far as that is possible in the middle of a pandemic caused by a new virus—without having to resort to the dissemination of false information along with promoting fairytales."

"I stand by that FLW. In the 2017-2018 flu season there was approx 61,000 flu deaths. Of that number Approx 51,000 were in the 65 and older age bracket. Between 0-17 it was approx 600. 18-49 approx 2,800. We don't call the yearly flu season where 51,000 elderly people die a pandemic. It is a yearly occurrence. When we have 51,000 0-17 year olds dying in a year from the flu, COVID-19 or whatever, yeah that's when you start to worry because that means proportionately several million people over 65 would be dying. Here's the CDC numbers FYI. https:/…2017-2018.htm"
Sigh:-(
"PnSfromLA #379I hear you! The issue I have is that your examples are all prior to March 9; we had similar responses here from various leaders. We can look at our provinces and see, based on the per capita numbers, what a huge effect the delay of 1-2 weeks at the start has had on the overall situation. The problem is that we’re now 5 months into this, and the situation is still not being dealt with by your federal government in a way that benefits the entire nation.The late implementation of a plan can lead to a poorer result; if a plan is implemented, then discontinued, the end results can be just as devastating. However if there is no plan at all, or if there is a disorganized, uneducated, vindictive bully that chooses to undermine everyone else’s plan every step of the way, the end result is the most devastating possibility of all. That is not just sad, it’s heartbreaking!Edited: 1:12 pm, August 20, 2020 "

"Another beauty “People are really surprised I understand this stuff,” he said. “Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability."
"""175,000 dead within 7 months"" And that's with a shutdown. We have no idea how many more would be dead if we hadn't shut down most of the country for weeks. Look at Brazil and Sweden, both with more death per capita than the U.S.A, even though Brazil has admitted to fudging their numbers."
"The vote is not necessarily for Sleepy Joe, the vote is clearly Anti Trump...the worst human being ever to step foot in WH"
"Firstly, it isn't 175,000 dead. We'll never know the real number because the virus was here before February and the number of deaths since February has been vastly over stated since we lump in basically everything possible with COVID deaths. Approx 2,500,000 people die every year in this country give or take. Even if we doubled that, it would only represent 14% of all deaths in this country. Or to look at it another way 0.1% of the entire country. Considering 0.72% approx. of the country dies every year this isn't a massive number. The US is in a unique position, many powers are delegated to the states. A one size fits all policy doesn't make sense. To be fair, the two states with the worst COVID numbers are deep blue states. So what went wrong? It isn't like many people were coming to CA during the first several months of this thing. Same with NY. There were stay at home orders, mask mandates, the economy is basically shot there, at least for small business owners. So what went wrong?"
What went wrong? Too many people flouted the rules.
""" 175,000 dead in less than 7 months""And that's in spite of significant and unprecedented mitigation measures (and hence rendering any comparison with flu for the same period meaningless) . If it weren't for those mitigations the number of deaths would almost certainly have been even higher than 175K.And although the mitigation measures have undoubtedly kept the death toll lower than it would otherwise have been, the tragedy is that those measures should have and would have been more succesful, were it not for those that chose to disregard them.Edited: 2:01 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"""I stand by that FLW.""For those who are following along he admitted (about a month ago he was wrong, no I'm not going to spend the effort to find it) that this was wrong. Now he was to own it. and with what? This nonsense, ""We don't call the yearly flu season where 51,000 elderly people die a pandemic. It is a yearly occurrence.""Stupid and heartless, that's all you get from the most selfish poster I've ever read in any medium in decades. Breathtaking. And so much effort to find statistics that he thinks proves his point. They don't. What a joke."
"""We'll never know the real number because the virus was here before February and the number of deaths since February has been vastly over stated since we lump in basically everything possible with COVID deaths.""Lie or just plain stupid. Your choice."
"We are a free people. No one is being forced to go outside. If the people that chose to go into the world were allowed to, unrestricted for the last 5 months we'd be a lot closer to herd immunity. More people might have died but that would have been our choice as individuals to take that risk. The people that wanted to stay home could have. What would they lose? I know people that have taken maybe 3 trips outside in the last 5 months. Nothing would change for them. Half measures don't work. Either you lockdown our borders, order everyone except EMS and medical staff inside for a month, close everything including most gas stations, all retail and food establishments, grocery stores etc. Or you let nature take its course, let people decide what works for them and accept that deaths will happen. Option 1 isn't possible, Option 2 is."
Dr Fauci is recovering from vocal-chord surgery. Get well soon Dr Fauci and thank you for your years of service to the nation.
"""we lump in basically everything possible with COVID deaths.""No we don't, that's nothing but a rumor. Fake news. And even if you believe it, do you think every country is doing the same? it's actually the opposite. if someone is positive and spends 20 days in the hospital fighting covid...on a ventilator etc, they can feel better and test negative on day 21 and then die on day 23. The death is not listed as a Covid death since they had tested negative 48 hours before death. The death is listed as lung failuire or kidney failure or heart failure.....ask any nurse or doctor or coroner. (Notice I didn't tell you to just take my word for it. Do some homework for a change)."
"FLW by the definition of a pandemic COVID-19 qualifies. However, in my personal opinion there is a huge difference between COVID-19 and 1918, the black death, etc. I believe my original comment was back in March. There needs to be sub categories of epidemics, pandemics because COVID-19 might be world wide but it isn't very deadly overall, at least not when compared to past pandemics."
"F.L.W , Don't usually agree with you, but Pns's constant bleating IS both stupid + heartless, not to mention juvenile + extremely selfish.Me,Me,Me."
"SiddyI say out loud what other people think but are too scared to thanks to others. Trump does the exact same thing, that is why he won, that is why he constantly beats polling expectations, and that is why he will win re-election."
"One would hope the members of these Health Departments have qualifications that would allow them to perform their jobs well. Unfortunately, because most government is crap, that isn't the case, though a pediatrician is a Doctor so I'll let that slide. The LA County Health Director looks like the product of a one night stand between the Crypt Keeper and Beetlejuice, worst of all her degree is basically in social work. You forgot Fauci, I mentioned him twice. Damn that guy is an idiot. I certainly don't expect Governors or the President to know about virology, but commonsense things like maybe don't put ""recovered"" COVID patients back into nursing homes without testing them first would be nice. Cuomo especially loves to go after Trump, well look at this reaction to the virus. That isn't Trump's fault, it is his own."
"394 writes "" we are a free people no one is being forced to go outside""Because you are not forced does not mean others aren't. For a news follower who knows essential workers and workers who are told they are essential are being forced to work you lie to set the agenda you have been fed.I am amazed at those who downplay the virus, justify the deaths yet these people wear masks to protect against this hoax disease and take other precautions."
Pns Don't have a dog in that fight.All for free speech.Herd immunity?? That's going well in Brazil I hear.
"@SiddyWhat are the costs most people aren't talking about? The economic devastation for one. The poorest will suffer the most from this. People in America and the UK think they have it bad? Look at the future for Africa, South America. It isn't bright thanks to the virus. How many people have committed suicide because of depression from the virus? Suicides are way way up. How many people are abusing drugs and alcohol? How are children handling this? It isn't normal for a 5 year old to have a mask shoved on their face, to be told they can't see their friends, can't go and do anything fun because some scary virus might kill them or mommy and daddy. What will the repercussions be of this? Herd immunity will come if young people go outside and live life. If a recovered COVID patient doesn't have antibodies, they might have t-cell immunity if not from COVID, from SARS, or even the cold. Those not at risk should be living life normally period."
"A doctor is still a doctor, they might not specialize in something but they still have a general idea of how to treat most things. Some specialists are quacks period. Cough cough, Fauci, a man who has ridden a desk for decades."

"i think that Trump undoubtedly picked up some votes last election because he campaigned (amongst other things) on a ticket of not being a career politician, of not being someone who speaks and acts like a politician. A straight talker if you like, someone who isn't going to be constrained by political tradition and process. Someone who would cut through the usual political fog, bureaucracy and inertia and get things done. Someone who would keep his promises once in office.And undoubtedly that appealed to some voters then. I get that.But there's no sense in being a straight talker if much of what you say is self-contradictory nonsense. If rather than debating and arguing your case you instead just insult those who would dare question you.There's no point in 'getting things done' if you haven't properly thought through the consequences of your decisions or actions; if there is no coherent policy or if you're making policy on the hoof. Constantly sacking and replacing senior members of your administration doesn't convey a picture of a strong leader who's not afraid to show he's in charge, but rather one of chaos and cluelessness.The notion of a 'non-politician' POTUS is not unattractive to voters, and such a person might well have achieved great things indeed, but it would have taken someone with a great deal more intellect and statesmanship than Trump possesses.I think those who voted for him on that particular ticket last time will not make the same mistake next time."
"So Qdog, if you got the virus, which I hope is never the case, you'd go to the ER. Explain exactly how then is the doctor treating you an expert? What makes him or her better than the Urgent Care doctor? Would you try to call in Fauci? No. You'd be treated by whatever staff was on hand, because hopefully they would know how to deal with COVID-19."

"I've been saying for weeks that the GOP was making a big tactical error labeling Biden as ""Sleepy Joe"" and claiming he is basically senile. All it did was massively lower the bar of expectations so much so that Biden's basically adequate speech tonight came across as fantastic to many. The Sanders campaign also sabotaged themselves in the way back in March heading into the big one on one debate. Biden was again just adequate, he's never been a compelling public speaker, but because expectations were so low it felt like he hit a home run. It's Politics 101, never lower the expectations of your opponent. 2salty is right, it will be interesting to see how the RNC does. Trump needs crowds to energize him, and he's never been very good delivering scripted speeches. He also needs to hit a home run and get a big bump from it. He's rapidly running out of time to shift the dynamic of the race."

"PnS is right about this: “ I say out loud what other people think but are too scared to thanks to others.”This is exactly why the Silent Majority is just that. There’s very few willing to admit to voting for Trump because the left automatically accuses them of being racist, without any logical discussion. Remember 2016 election night? Dems were gloating so much the first several hours because of the polling responses, not realizing they created a HUGE silent Majority by their racist actions.

"“ You realize more people voted for Hillary Clinton, right?” Another reading comprehension lesson for you, Irish.

"“ uhhh...doesn't majority mean more than 50%? i'm confused then...if Trump won with the majority..how come more votes were cast in favor of crooked Hillary? Sorry, my reading comprehension must be bad too, my apologies.”Well, I guess you’re right newbie, you do have terrible reading comprehension. The Silent Majority are the folks that don’t wish to say anything...hence the word “silent.”They encompass the majority of conservatives...get it now? The MAJORITY of conservatives that don’t wish to speak because they’re labeled as racist by the liberals. Guess what? Racism is also labeling a wide group of people as racist without even knowing them. That’s another great and respectful liberal tactic. 13"
"Yep, that’s right. Go back and look at how many posts you’ve put out there that call me a racist.

I just wish people would keep this stuff civil. Being called or implied to be a racist is one of the most vile things you call someone. The bar is being set so low to where anything not within a hair's breath of a person's opinions is now worthy of this. It isn't right. No one would here would dare say some of these things to people's faces directly and that is the problem. People really need to think a bit before they get personal.

I don't support the ideals of the movement as much of what BLM espouses is antithetical to the betterment of black people, our country and people in general. BLM is a great marketing concept as I have discussed before. Like many great marketing concepts, the reality is far from what is being sold. I fight for the change I feel will best benefit black people, white people, other people of color, all people. Maybe your views on things are different but in the end the main goal is the same. People being treated fairly, equitably, and with decency."

You in California hold a NYC city council member as an expert and responsible but the person who is in charge the one who sioad the virus was greatly under control 172,000 + deaths ago, him you assign no responsibility & more importantly you do not hold him up as a leader and rightly so.I agree with you that potus should never be considered and expert or a leader.

"Tom,Actually I'd call SD's cases fairly stable. There is a small spike recently but in actual numbers vs percent increase it isn't massive. In fact, it is still far below the numbers from early May, this despite a significant increase in available PCR, antigen and serology tests being done right now. Given that effectively South Dakota is open for business as usual they are doing very very well."

You did write you would seek treatment from her or did you forget?Thank you again for pointing out how forward thinking Harris was so early in her career. Another positive in her qualification as vp.You describe her legal action as a ""stunt"". I know you disagree with her politically. I hope you only single her out and base your view on her politics and not her gender or her race. You did take the time and effort to inform everyone that Harris is not an African American. Why that bothers you, only you can explain and perhaps with your credentials to determine what race/ethnicity people are.After writing the paragraph stating Harris is not African American, your next paragraph faulted her as a black woman!

At 70 years old I finally did something I had been wanting to do for a long time time. I pulled 60% of my IRA out of stock and bond funds and it is safely parked in cash. It is enough along with my social security to keep me going at my present lifestyle till I'm 80. I am just waiting for the inflationary cycle that all this deficit spending that the king of debt is using to prop things up starts and I can get some growth buying nice safe cds. No more greed or worry about IRAs for me.
"Qdog - with all respect, YOU don’t understand economics. The stock market is highly correlated with the economy with the market serving as s leading indicator. That’s why POTUS and economists keep bringing it up. By the way, if the stock market is up, it has a positive wealth effect where people spend more as they now have bigger account balances, a self fulfilling impact. I know, most don’t have retirement savings right? That is an old mantra. The situation has improved tremendously with corporations required to make contributions to employee accounts. Also, and more importantly, they are not the job creators and the engine of the economy. It’s popular to hate the rich, but without them we don’t have money and job creation which is good for all.If anyone thinks raising taxes and increasing government oversight of business is going to get the economy back on track they are a fool! Businesses were leaving the US in droves when we had a 35% corporate tax rate. We were way above the average for OECD countries.Edited: 9:54 am, August 22, 2020 "
"Vpearl - probably a good move with uncertain timing. Government debt stifles GDP growth once it approaches nominal GDP in dollars. Some inflation is not bad and the Fed would like to see it, but via higher wage growth not from increasing money supply. We need to take on some debt right now to deal with the virus, but the Dems are asking for blood money, literally! What they are asking for will cripple future growth and degrade the living standards of many future generations. I guess that is their goal, a welfare state reliant on big government. I mean that is how slum lord Pelosi makes her money and stays in power, right? She approves larger welfare payments that are then funneled back to her through all the section 8 houses she owns in San Francisco. And get this, I think her husband builds those rentals.

Qdog when you say windbag do you mean Trump or fauci?
"it doesn't really make any sense for someone without any symptoms, who is not traveling somewhere of concern where it is required, to be tested for COVID19. Doesn't make any sense to say it isn't ""smart"". Why not, if you don't have any symptoms? What is the purpose of testing for someone who has no symptoms. There aren't any unless there is some possibility they are going somewhere and might infect someone (like visiting an elderly person at home who has predisposing conditions). Some crazy idea on here, like somehow you could have COVID with zero symptoms and thus it would be ""unwise"" to not be tested for it. If you have it and have no symptoms at all, what different does it make. If you have symptoms, then I'm sure you'd get that test to find out what your problem might be. Especially teh remarked about being a ""frail, eldlery"" person which implies the reason is that you somehow could be seriously affected without ever knowing it and a test that you had it, even with no symptoms, would somehow be important. Because otherwise, your age and condition is irrelevant if the point is to make sure you don't transmit it to others if you are traveling, for example.It makes sense for Trump given he constantly is around other people than his immediate family, and he doesn't wear a mask usually and isn't that far from them a lot of the time. Also, given his current job, he is exposed to a lot more people.The idea that Biden has problems with plagiarism and thus unfit compared to Trump who can barely utter a sentence without outright making stuff up and lying is absurd.Edited: 4:45 pm, August 23, 2020 "

#606 Do you want to bet $20 on the election?
Every time I hear The Donalds voice on the TV this verse from a great old Bob Dylan song starts running through my brain.Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth.You're an idiot babe. It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
"Do you think that I or anyone for that matter would bet with someone that they don't know? If you only knew what I do for a living. $20 doesn't even tickle me bro!I got an ideaThe loser has to come on here an admit they were wrong about the election AND can't post on Trip Advisor until February. Yes? Agree?Edited: 5:55 pm, August 23, 2020 "
$20 doesn't tickle me either. I was just trying to make it easy on you.Yes I agree.
Ok my friend. Done. I have your name circled. Carry on. Good luck

"QDogI could be wrong in this, but weren't the Obama's college records mostly sealed? Could have sworn Biden's were too. I could be wrong on this, does anyone know?"
@LessonI actually had someone on Facebook bet me $50 that I didn't cancel a reservation in Vegas because I was upset at the mask mandate. I sent them a contact info redacted cancellation of my Skyloft booking. The other person was a man of his word. Sent me the money immediately. Actually seemed like a good guy even though we were on other sides of the issue. I'd be fine having a beer with the guy in Vegas sometime. Said he comes in with friends every year for the Superbowl.
I did make a $20 bet with placebets late last year. I said Trump would get impeached and he said he wouldn't. Trump did get impeached but placebets refused to pay up saying since he wasn't convicted by the Senate that means he did not get impeached.I remind placebets whenever I see him post but he just ignores it.
"“ I could be wrong in this, but weren't the Obama's college records mostly sealed?Could have sworn Biden's were too. I could be wrong on this, does anyone know?”“ Sealed” to the same extent that anyone’s are. Not “ sealed” in any kind of legal sense. Like adoption records or a juvenile arrest."
PnSfromLA that's a nice story. Unfortunately because I have been involved with many sports betting forums over 20 years I have seen first hand people promise and raise their right hand and swear they would pay on a losing bet to just disappear. Lesson4me! I have met many nice people in Vegas over the years as well. I am usually found in a Vegas sports book at least 10-15 times a year except this year of course. I booked my first trip for 9/23-9/29.
I fully expected to not ever get paid. I was pleasantly surprised. It is nice to see people be men or women of their word.
"i will vote for Trump if: 1) He shows us his taxes2) Mexico pays for the wall3) He locks Hillary up4) I am covered by his bigger better healthcare plan by November 2nd. The plan that he said (4 weeks ago) would be rolled out in two weeks. Am I asking too much? If so please explain, you might just sway me."
Actually I'll settle for two out of four. He's got my vote if just two out of four of the above happen. Most of them were promises he made 4 years ago so I think I'm being pretty fair.

"“The media had me believing that if I touch a contaminated surface I die in the next few minutes.”""Amazing how easily some people are misled"" Fear? You wanna talk about fear? Okay let's talk about the real fearmongers. Fear that Obama would turn the country Muslim and appoint Farrakahn his top advisor. Fear that the ACA would mean 6 month waits to see a doctor if you are sick. Death panels! All the doctors will leave the profession! Total disaster! Fear that Hillary runs a sex-trafficking ring. Fear that democrats want to murder all the babies. Fear that nasty Hollywood is gonna turn all our children gay. Fear that the same people who were going to turn our country into a Muslim nation are now going to turn it into a socialist hybrid of Cuba and Venezuela. The horrors! Fear that Biden will take our precious guns away and we'll have no protection from the boogeyman. Fear that Obama set up Adam Lanza so that Obama could take our guns away.Fear that our children would not like Michelle Obama's carrot sticks. Fear that Biden is going to close all the police departments and open the borders!Fear that we'll have a black WOMAN as vice president, and possibly even PRESIDENT! Fear that living in a city apartment makes everyone turn nasty. Fear that the people marching in the streets are all looters and criminals. Fear that 70 people might mail in an illegally obtained ballot. The mexicans are coming1 The mexicans are coming! Can't that wall go up any faster? Fear that putting on a mask means that you are not true diehard Maga. Fear that the horrid dems will give people more food stamps and a higher minimum wage. (Oh no, those damn essential workers might start living half as well as I do!) Ha ha and all that from the same people who love to holler ""just stay home if you are afraid!"". Look in the mirror if you want to see who the fraidy cats are."

"Tom, I live on a street with houses that cost $1,000,000, with Mercedes and BMW's parked in the garages. One block over next to an empty lot there is a homeless encampment that the police are at all the time. Three blocks the other way is an even larger encampment that has taken over the sidewalk on the side of a church. The camp is used partially as a bicycle chop shop. Several months ago on the same day there were two unrelated shootings all within three blocks of me. So yeah, I have a right to feel the way I do."

It is actually middle of the road with some high end pockets and some low end ones. However, if a neighborhood like mine has so many issues with encampments, drugs, crime, etc. what do you think the ""bad"" neighborhoods like Compton, Watts, and the rest of South LA is like? I don't want to live in South LA. I don't very much want to live where I do now. Hence the search for new states.

Plagiarizing lying slow corrupt Joe may or may not show up for the debates... minus his brain of course. He should leave his basement and enter an assisted living facility. Talk about a dunce.
PrnprCouldn’t agree with you more!
"Once again, 2 followers of the party with morals and family values ridicule a man who has had brain surgery.May Jerry Falwell Jr pray for both of you. : )"
"“ voting blue can save what’s remaining of our damaged Republic.”Lol, it’s been damaged by lunatic liberals that are trashing and destroying our cities. Well, not my cities, we take care of that S with lethal force and common sense, and everyone knows it. That’s why we don’t have issues down here. 13"
^^^And your comments concerning our President are most virtuous. Typical double standard hypocrites. May “Reverend” Sharpton forgive you. BTW. Do you really think a man whose had brain surgeries should be considered for President? He should release his cognitive tests he said were performed. But that was another lie. But that’s okay he’s a Democrat. Familiar pattern.

"Keep him in the basement until the debate. That’s where he likes being, so keep sleeping, sleepy Joe."

The ironic thing about the protesters going after Sen. Rand Paul and his wife was that Sen. Paul was the one who wrote and introduced the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act. That is how absolutely clueless those people are.
"They are clueless. Those groups of people are only out there to inact violence. They have no interest in protesting peacefully. If so, that’s what it would be. I say lock them up and throw away the key. Burning businesses down and looting and people being hurt. They deserve too be locked up."
-654
"Speaking of clueless. The Dems control the press and T.V. They have chosen to hide the truth taking the American people for granted that we wouldn't really believe what's going on every night in this country. The people have finally had enough of this. As long as there is mayhem this election is a slam dunk in my opinion. Yes, COVID-19 is a horrible disease and it's here to stay a while I think, but it looks like the people despise the current action from the blue side. Maybe I'm wrong but I am willing to bet I'm not.And for you Fox news people- make sure you watch Tucker next Monday or Tuesday as he is supposed to be showing a different side of Chris Cuomo as he's caught on tape saying things that he does not really believe in. This should be really good."
Fredo (Chris Cuomo) oh man I will have too tune in just so I can see what Fredo has said now. Bet it will be interesting.

Have a nice evening people.
"771 and 772,I am usually good with puzzles, but your two posts do not make any sense to me.Can you articulate, please?Hunt"
772 will make more sense if you change it from a minus 2 to just a 2.
"""It looks like the people despise the current action from the blue side. ""What current action from the blue side? I don't know what you are talking about, please elaborate."
#772-654 is the answer
"HardtenThanks, you are correct the last number should have been 2I officially remove my name from consideration for President. I am sure I counted down further than 1 famous test taker. : )"
"782One of the questions, really tough questions on the cognitive test was count down by 7s from 100.Another challenge was a picture of an elephant, the test question was identify this animal."
"Thanks glepaw, I am not one to turn down constructive criticism.How did you arrive at -654?"
I guessed
"delta wingYou may find this of interesthttps:/…Your post # 636 accurately forecast that Sturgis SD rally goers virus infection could show up as late as August 30.

"“How would you even know it is not like you have the most covid cases in the world?”You’re correct, we don’t have the most Covid cases in the world, thankfully.Our federal, provincial, and municipal leaders listen to the scientists and medical advisors here, then put guidelines in place for the public to follow, with appropriate consequences for those who don’t do their part to keep fellow citizens in the community safe. As the science improves, the guidelines change.Initially we all thought a 2 week shut down would be sufficient to “flatten the curve!” Turned out it wasn’t, and from watching the pattern here it’s obvious that it takes about 3 weeks for the case numbers to go up, and about 4 weeks for deaths to start showing up.Hand washing, social distancing and mask wearing to protect “others” works; we comply because we know that while we’re wearing masks to keep others safe, they do the same in return for us. “Team Canada” approach has worked better than “It’s my right not to...”By the way, we still have daily briefings by the regional leaders, as well as the medical officers of health, televised across the nation.Edited: 11:48 pm, August 29, 2020 "

"Trump said he can solve the problem in Portland in an hour.“We can solve that problem in perhaps one hour. We’ll solve your problem with violence. We’ll solve your problem with crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly and you’ll be able to have a very peaceful evening in Portland,” President Trump said.https:/…So why doesn't he do it?"
"""he was trying to get away from them"" is what potus stated at today's briefing referring to the killer of two demonstrators in Kenosha.Yes, killers do try to flee the scene, he did get that right. ""then he stumbled and they attacked him"" was another quote. I wear glasses but without them I saw no one attacking. I saw a stumble and then a killer shoot his weaponThe question asked of potus was why won't you confirm the killer who is a supporter of yours. No condemnation was issued."

I think it best I not tell my friend Kim her mom IS an American. I'll let her bf Don, we call him Jr tell her. Jr does like his gf's loud and not too bright. : )"
"#825“does it occur to you to be strange that all the problem areas are run by democrats, open your eyes...”@MrNiceGuy,Does that really surprise you? I don’t know why it should? Doesn’t it stand to reason that cities run by democrats are cities that are more likely to have a larger population currently concerned about the lack of racial justice? Those individuals apparently have the right to exercise their right to freedom of speech, assemble peacefully, etc.However, there appears to be another, smaller part of the population intent on stopping them, or creating the illusion that they’re not protesting peacefully. Who’s agenda is that? Why would this latter group “intentionally” create problems in cities that have already elected republican representatives? The answer is likely that they don’t need to; they’re happy with the status quo.In response to your question, “...does it occur to you to be strange that all the problem areas are run by democrats, open your eyes...”, I’ll ask you, “Who are you parroting, and who are those individuals parroting?”Remember that in many things, correlation doesn’t prove causation...maybe you should “open your mind”?"
"Give credit to the 2020 campaign. After showing video of actions in the streets of the US presently happening under potus with the claim ""this is what Biden's America will look like"" someone told them the obvious. LOLThe 2020 campaign then used footage of actions from Barcelona Spain (not a US state v dude) claiming that is what Biden's America will look like. So is Biden running for President of US or Spain? Or is this another hoax???"
"yankee hater, I appreciate your non sense."
"Why is no one pointing out that 5 of the top 6 US states with per capita covid cases are led by governors of the gop? The #1 state per capita is Louisiana which has a dem gov but its sheep follow what they are told by cable news, the channel labeling covid as a hoax. Do you guys not like winning???Florida Mississippi Arizona Alabama Georgia are 2-6. SEC country"
Yeah Biden had one huge crowd outside today as he stumbled and stuttered Inside.
"Why did Herman Cain's twitter account remove their tweet ""looks like the virus is not as deadly as main stream media made it out to be""? Is his death a hoax? What's going on?"
