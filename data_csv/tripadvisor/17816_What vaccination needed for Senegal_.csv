hi everyone!My friend and I are thinking of going to Senegal this summer and we dont know what diseases we should get vaccinated against. Can someone help us in this please?Thank you :)
"Senegal require yellow fever vaccine, other is optional. Ask your vaccine central what they recommend you."
"The main required vaccines are: tiroïd,, yellow fever, hepatis A, hepatis B,meningitis, poliomyelitis, tetanus ,diphteria, pertussis. The malaria vaccine is not available yet you have to approach your doctor for preventions."
"I don't think they required it, only recommend it: As long as visitors come from areas with yellow fever or typhoid epidemics, it requires some vaccines.But yellow fever, malaria, cholera and typhoid vaccines are recommended.There is a difference between the recommended and required."
"So yellow fever is the only one required, right? (just checking that I got you guys right)"
"Yes, it is, but actually nobody on the border or airport checked it LOL"
Thank you Khamlia :)
You are welcome ☺
