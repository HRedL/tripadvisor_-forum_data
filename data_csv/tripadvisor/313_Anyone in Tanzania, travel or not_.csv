"Hi all I was wondering if anyone was currently in TZ or had recently travelled there. I am based in Kenya and the UK but currently in the UK during this Covid crisis. A part of me is tempted to head to TZ at the start of July for up to two months. I work in adventure travel and am keen to explore more in Tanzania and also spend some time looking at different things there. I was wondering what the mood on the ground was, and whether during this time it would be seen as a bit crass to be traveling around. Or would it be the opposite and perhaps help to spur on some tourism. Also very keen to get back to the continent, but cant get back home to Kenya until the borders reopen! Thanks for any pointers"
Life is going on as normal with follow up the term and conditions about COVID-19
"Can you anonymously contact another tourism company in TZ, and inquire of the travel situation? Also, our Airline is very helpful in digging deep into what's going on when we call with questions."
C.C which airline are you referring to?
We are thinking of doing the same for a 6 week trip. Can anyone advise whether restaurants / bars and guest houses are open as normal? Is a mask required to be worn in public? Thanks for any feedback in advance
Hi WPAAnd airlines have started arriving with a trickle of tourists
"HiYes, Tanzania Tourism is slowly opening-up and some of the airlines have started arriving as achnab said. We hope things will be okay in the next few months as the whole world is opening up slowly as well."
"Thanks that's some good info to get, it seems things are opening up quite a bit if people are arriving. Thanks for the input."

"Thanks for the advice all. The only other question I have is this - I've spoken to my Travel insurance Company regarding cover, and they have advised that as the British Foreign Office is still advising against all but essential travel worldwide that our policy will be invalid for our trip. Does anyone know if I could purchase some insurance with a Tanzanian Company for the duration of our trip? We are only really concerned about medical expenses. Sorry to jump on the original post Wild path Adventure :)"
"If you get a little bit ill then medical care is very cheap in Tanzania, and it won't cost you the earth if you have to spend a night in hospital. However, if you get seriously ill, you are going to want to be evacuated, and I don't think you will get cover for that either inside or outside Tanzania. I think the very fact that insurance companies won't take your money is an indication of what a foolhardy and dangerous thing it is to travel at the moment. In my opinion, I appreciate others will differ."
"As you say Susan, other opinions will differ. I suppose it all depends whether you believe all the hype surrounding this virus. If you look at it without the hype, then the death rate is less than 1% - comparable with the flu. I'm not prepared to live under house arrest based on those figures! Life is too short. Thanks for the input though. Anyway, this is not the forum to discuss that particular issue :)"

"I doubt any insurer would cover medical expenses due to Covid 19. You would however be covered for non Covid expenses such as car accidents etc.,You could also try AMREF in Nairobi for emergency cover."
"Kabba12 if you are travelling against FCO advice you could try Campbell Irvine in the UK who I have used in such circumstances before.Also, if you're on Facebook there's a nice video from Asilia of their first guests arriving from Sweden, so some people are definitely travelling. The problem here in the UK is the FCO advice (and flights). There is talk/rumour in travel circles that this may be amended or lifted along with the quarantine regs at the end of this month/early next month, but until the government makes their move we are all in the dark.Alexandra- Extraordinary Africa"
"Thanks both. Been trawling the net for a few days now. Can't find anything reasonably priced. Couldn't find anywhere through Amref where to buy a policy. Maybe I was looking in the wrong place? Campbell Irvine are really expensive as are the other High risk insurers. Gonna wait a few days and hope the FCO advice changes. Seems crazy to spend more on your insurance than flights! Really frustrating with lots of flights resuming but you can't use them as you can't get insurance, unless you're prepared to take the risk (getting a bit old for that now)!"
"The link you require for AMREF is https://www.flyingdoctorsafrica.org/ I don't agree your figure of a 1% death rate. I make it 6% as at today .7,624,552 cases and 425,926 deaths. I am sure that you realise that even if you don't die the experience of Covid19 is not just a sniffle and cough.Not something just to shrug off as an alternative to 'house arrest' as you put it. Cases are still occurring in UK even though lockdown has eased,"
"IIt is slowly coming up, but the truth is, I live in Tanzania, and I have been in Tanzania from January! The situation has improved a lot, colleges have opened it has been two weeks now, I live nearby college, and life is as normal as before covid-19, it is next to impossible to think that anyone can hide death in colleges, they seems okay!Few tourists have started coming to Tanzania, and again it seems okay, of course we have to observe for sometimes, but I am very much sure that there is is no such risk as people think!Edited: 1:06 am, June 14, 2020 "
"Ah mfuwe, but you probably don't have access to inside info like I do. All deaths are being put down as Covid, without testing, regardless whether the Cause was Covid or not, as long as you're displaying one of the symptoms. I know someone who works for the Coroners office who confirmed this for me. That means the figures have been vastly inflated, as the Italians have confirmed in their country. Anyway, as I said, this is not the forum for debate on that matter. For anyone interested, I found a High Risk insurance company with very reasonable rates that will cover us, so we're booked and ready to go. Their name, for anyone else in this position is SALT insurance.com. I don't have any affiliation to this company, but it took a long time to find a reasonable quote given the FCO advice, so anyone wanting insurance could try this company and save themselves some time."
"As you say this is not the forum for stats so I would only suggest your friend is somewhat deluded. To reach your 1% would reduce the death total (or increase the case total) by a factor of 5.So is it 43m cases worldwide or only 85,000 deaths? ( Hint. There are over 115,000 deaths in USA already.)"
"Figures for Scotland show 36% more deaths in the worst week, compared to the 5 year average. This has dropped to 8% in the last week. I have little doubt that these deaths were due to Covid 19, or complications arising from it. So, 700 additional deaths in a week. Hard to see how these are inflated, unless someone is making up additional deaths.My family in Mwanza say that there are around 7 additional deaths a day at the moment - not a huge number, but an indication that all is not well. And Mwanza doesn’t have a lot of coming and going.Take your chances - that’s your choice. But don’t belittle the grief of people who have been affected by this by saying it’s all made up."
Well said Susan.
Nobody is belittling anyone. Read the posts properly

Well said Susan
"You cannot take the official case number to calculate the infection fatality rate of the virus, as many more people have been infected than people who have been tested positive (as later serology tests showed).At the beginning of the epidemic in Itay and France for instance, not everybody could get tested - so often they told people showing light symptoms to stay home and come back for a PCR test *15 days after the end of symptoms* .And obviously they missed a huge number of asymptomatic people too.So it's not so much the numerator that is a problem, but the denominatorA few weeks ago the CDC had estimated the IFR in the range of 0.26-0.40,"
"Exactly. The whole thing is punctuated with guess work and estimates. So both the numerator and denominator are unknown which makes the equation x/x a tad vague. What price Kabba's ""inside info"" now?The one certainty is that there are 1,000s of people around the world who are grieving who would not have been and for which foolhardy/selfish actions by several people must take some of the blame.Edited: 7:05 am, June 15, 2020 "
"I blame the virusJust like I blamed the virusesIf we all stopped breathing forever, nobody would ever die again of respiratory diseases. No more grieving"
I will be in Arusha on August 12 and was wondering how much cash to carry for an eight day safari? I imagine will be purchasing sundowners at the various encampments but specifically for a bit of shopping in Arusha and Zanzibar - how much is a sufficient?
"Allowing say $100 per day I would bring$1,000. You don't HAVE to spend it and can always take it home again if you don't."
"Hi! 100 a day? thats very affordable? do you know what tour operators have these good prices? we are planning a safari, but the prices are just too high."
"Jessie, Mfuwe is suggesting that they bring $100 a day “ spending money” for drinks, souvenirs, extras etc , this is on top of the price for their safari - this is NOT the cost of the actual safari"
Yup. Even I will have to spend more than $100 per day for a safari. NB. I am NOT saying you need to spend that sum on booze and souvenirs. A beer is $5.
