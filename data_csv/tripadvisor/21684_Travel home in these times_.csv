"One question I have not seen anyone, anywhere, address is: Should you travel to get home right now? The reason I think this is something to consider is purely the statistics right now. (Here I am referring to cases CONFIRMED by testing, and reported cases. There are of course many thousands of cases not yet confirmed from people who have NO SYMPTOMS, and people who do have symptoms but have been neither tested or reported.)If you are in Mexico with fewer than TWO HUNDRED cases, should you return to, or through, areas like Washington state where there have been way more that 200 deaths!?! Calif. which has thousands of cases? New York with 10,000 cases?Assuming you could even get a flight, should you lock yourself into a metal tube with perhaps over 100 strangers who may or may not have the virus? The air in a plane is RECIRCULATED throughout your flight WITH NO FILTERS. If even ONE PERSON on that plane has the virus, without showing any symptoms, or with symptoms but hiding them so they can 'Get home.', what are the chances that you will walk off that plane newly infected?All I am saying is, consider IF YOU SHOULD even try to return to your NOB home. Even Africa (Which is USUALLY a hot spot for all kinds of infectious diseases) has far fewer cases than almost any state in the union. Less than Canada too I believe. Just think about it."
"Canada announced assistance for travelers who need to shelter outside of country a few days ago, consular services will have details."
These are questions I am asking myself about both Mazatlan and let's say Tucson or PhoenixAre meds like Plaquenil (the malaria med) readily available?Will meds be available as they come to market? I can't coumadin or warfarin in MexicoHow many hospital beds are available?How many ventilators are available?How difficult will it be to find a doctor?How many people already have the virus and are not counted?How much will Doctors and hospitalization cost in Mazatlan? It will cost $0.00 in the U.S.Please feel free to add to the list
"""On planes, people are provided 10 liters of air per second. Planes pull air in through the floor vents along the wall. All vents lead into the same core system, where the air is filtered, and the old air is cut with 50% fresh air from outside, then spit out through the ceiling. So about half the air you’re breathing at any moment is old.""https://www.fastcompany.com/90474397/its-tim…"
"FR: Perhaps you might rethink that one?""Filtration"" and ""Ventilation"" have been required in commercial HVAC apps longer than we've lived.Edited: 8:27 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Having said that, I remember when cigarette smoking was permitted on airplanes - we were seated in the last row beneath the central HVAC return grille and breathing more than our share of second hand smoke. If there's still a single return at the back of today's airplanes, best avoid sitting near it to limit exposure to whatever's in the unfiltered air coming back."
"Greggrs.... Except for a couple of them, good questions. But the same questions apply in the US as well. The two thatfall short are:""Are meds like Plaquenil (the malaria med) readily available?"" Since the 'evidence' that it helps small, and was shot down immediately by the scientist/doctor on the team that does all the press conferences it is doubtful that it is of any help at all.""How much will Doctors and hospitalization cost in Mazatlan? It will cost $0.00 in the U.S.? I would not count on that at all. Trump said it would, but Trump says a lot and MOST of it is wrong."

""Filtration"" and ""Ventilation"" have been required in commercial HVAC apps longer than we've lived.Perhaps longer than you have lived, but 'HVAC' is a rather new term and in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and into the 70's the filters were quite primitive compared to modern systems. I don't think airliners have ANY 'anti-viral' filters at all."
"We've all heard of ""Willis Carrier"", right?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Carrier""Anti-viral filters"" - I don't know either, but there are ""filters"", and the air is not 100% recirculated.And as I've said elsewhere here, I'm not inclined to get on a plane either."
"Most of our snowbird friends have either flown or driven back to the US and Canada. We are taking the lesser of the two evils--we're staying put in Mazatlan with the idea that if Spring break brings the usual mob of Mexican tourists from the interior and the corona virus numbers go up here, we will likely have our son drive down and pick us up and take us home in the Seattle area."
"Thank you for updates Mazexp, stay safe."
"Post 9: I thought that the Mex/USA border was closed down, so having your son come down from Seattle to Maz would not, or could not be an option. If the virus spreads more in Mexico with Nationals coming to populated areas, it may be too late for you to return as you may already have the virus....I would recommend returning home."
The Canadian Media is saying that Mexico is doing very little to contain the virus in Mexico....get out while u r healthy or alive.
"Roger, Finding a doctor is really a USA Question. A doctor in Maz is easy to find.I have medicare and medicare supplement F and meds.I guess I have some more reading on Plaquenil"
"Yea. Go back to Canada where they have Coronavirus Cases: 1,426 and 20 Deaths! (As of yesterday) So much safer. LOLEdited: 4:56 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Greggers.....""I guess I have some more reading on Plaquenil"" Start with this: ""Please don't take hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) plus Azithromycin for #COVID19 UNLESS your doctor prescribes it. Both drugs affect the QT interval of your heart and can lead to arrhythmias and sudden death, especially if you are taking other meds or have a heart condition.""This is from DOCTORS. Not tRump who is recommending it!!!!!!Dr. Edsel Salvana @EdselSalvana Mar 21Dr. Eugene Gu, MD""Both plaquenil & azithromycin can potentially cause a cardiac disturbance called prolonged QTc. Taken together, these drugs might cause a fatal arrhythmia (torsades de pointes). Or they might help clear virus from the blood. We don't really know. ""Dr. Matt McCarthy""WHO has NOT approved the use of chloroquine for #COVID19 management."""
"It was in the 80's in southern DE Friday and people surged to the beaches as they are wont to do with a sudden warm spell. No ""Social Distancing"" at all.https:/…Edited: 6:22 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"M:""...the usual mob of Mexican tourists from the interior...""What's the likelihood they've been exposed? How many of them will have flown internationally recently, etc.?DW and I are thinking it'll still be better here than exposing ourselves in airplanes and airports.According to what I've seen here, there are ""NO"" confirmed cases in Maz. Are you worried the ""mob"" will contract it here from unconfirmed carriers and then spread it amongst us?Edited: 6:37 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"If Semana Santa is even 50% of what it is normally I would say yea, that is plenty to be concerned about. But that applies to all the popular coastal destinations in Latin America. It sounds like the US has clamped down on the spring breakers."
"I was wondering that too. But, IF you get sick there, then you would be taking resources away from the local people if they needed them and the care might not be the same as in Canada. (My only reference point as I'm from there) Things could there very change fast as well."
"If the infection curve in Mexico follows what has happened in Italy or Spain for example then by April 5th Semana Santa there may be around 30,000 covid19 cases, 3000 deaths, city lockdowns and armed troops patrolling the streets, certainly hope I'm wrong though."
Found a few side effects of the Plaquenilhttps:/…
Greggrs I think Reddit may give you much more opinions/facts/theories/discussion of the treatments for CV than Tripadvisors Forum. I have no issue with your posts or anyone else's I'm just doubting you'll get what you're looking for here.Here's a Reddit sub pertaining to Plaquenil as related to the CV.https:/…
"The people in the U S are not taking this very seriously.Over the weekend all the parks & camp grounds on the Oregon & Washington coasts were full of vacationers from the cities that are known to have produced the majority of Corona virus cases, sharing drinks hugging, kissing, playing soccer & football, shaking hands ect.  Thankfully it looks as though there are a couple break troughs in treatment, so we may be seeing a decline in cases soon.  Stay calm, wash your hands frequently, & avoid crowds Safe travels Life is good"
"""armed troops patrolling the streets""We have spent years in Mazatlan...never knew a time when 'armed troops' were not patrolling the streets :)"
"Sadly, my mother in law passed today in Mazatlan (heart attack) and my husband here jn the USA is thinking about flying from Boston back to his home to Mazatlan. Of course, I’ll support his decision, but I am concerned about the coronavirus/ covid-19 medical risks to all involved, there and here. Please tell me what is the current medical state in Mazatlan, so that we can decide if travel now is out."
Very sorry for your family.I have not heard a lot about whats actually going on inside the medical facilities and I'm not even sure if reporting is accurate. What's the reason he is coming here? If only for a funeral that might not even be happening.The trip from Boston to Maz is risky in my opinion and your concern is warranted.
"Thank you. He would like to say goodbye to his Mom. He was thinking about flying from Boston to Mazatlan for the wake (but it will be only tonight through and tomorrow), and for the burial (tomorrow?). Since the flight out of Boston at 4:30 pm on Tues. takes 25 hours and arrives in Mazatlan late on Wed. afternoon, its unlikely he will get there in time. I feel for those who were unable to be with their loved ones to say goodbye (travel or not).."
