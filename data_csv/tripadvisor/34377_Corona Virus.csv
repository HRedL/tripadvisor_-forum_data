"Hi everyone, I am on the verge of booking a trip to Peru in June this year. I have the itinerary all worked out and most hotels booked but my wife is starting to have second thoughts due to the Corona Virus. I could not find good information in English on the situation in Peru but understand that no cases have been reported yet. Can anyway provide me with some details on how Peru is cooping and if I should hold off on confirming my trip or not? Thanks."

"I'm in the same boat. We are on the verge of confirming our travel details for mid-June but having second thoughts as well. We're less concerned about getting the virus than we are about investing in this trip only to have the borders shut down, or sites like Machu Picchu closed to tourists."
"Please, check the CDC website for official information https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.htmlI hope you have gotten your routine vaccinations including the flu shot."
I'm the same I am on the verge of booking a La Paz to Cusco tour and flights but am wondering if I should hold off for a bit? Its exciting and sad when you have dreams and you want to turn them into reality but have these hesitant thoughts. I'm travelling solo too which is another concern (especially for my husband) if I get held up on my trip or if I happen to contract the virus.. But Peru looks amazing and I want to see it..
"Here is a link to the UK government detailing the number of confirmed cases by country outside of China. Peru is not on that list . The USA comes in at number 8 with 60 cases. On that basis, one would assume that you would be ""safer"" in Peru than in the USA. Of course, tomorrow’s numbers will be different. No one will be able to provide you with "" details on how Peru is cooping"" simply because it has nothing to cope with.No one here can possibly advise you on whether you should go ahead with your trip or not. I would be happy to travel but that doesn’t matter one iota. In fact I am tossing up at the moment whether to fly to Vietnam or Italy next week, both countries where case have been reported.I take the pragmatic view that there are always flu cases going around the world. This one just seems to be getting a hell of a lot more publicity. Some perspective is needed if feel. I read that this years flu epidemic in the US had infected some 24 million and killed 16000. That wouldn’t prevent me visiting the US."
"Only you can make this decision. June is a long way away, anything could happen including the spread in your own country. Note just because countries may not have reported cases does not mean they don't have them - as they may not have testing facilities or just have lack of reporting mechanisms (can be for various reasons). As others have said there are other infections out there that currently have a higher fatality rate but does that stop people travelling? At the end of the day you have to make decision and then be happy with it - we can't make it for you."
"It's certainly true that only the traveler can make the final decision on whether or not to ahead with their travel plans but it's also more complicated than ""everyone gets the flu"".Governments around the world have shown that they have no problem shutting down airports tourist sites and gathering places at the drop of a hat. Major conferences and events, even months out, are being cancelled and there's even talks of canceling the Olympics in July. Our travel provider has just confirmed that while they'd be happy to help us rebook and reschedule due to travel problems that arise from the outbreak, we would be on the hook for all associated costs and losses. Even CFAR travel insurance only reimburses you for 50 to 75% of your losses.One of the best things about planning travel is the anticipation of the great trip you have scheduled. Spending the next weeks and months worrying doesn't sound like much fun.It looks like this isn't our year for adventure travel, unfortunately."
Or you can just wait & see how things look in a month from now...
"welcome,I know you want assurances, but you may know that mother nature and bugs usually dont go by what we humans do, think or say.So if you wifey isnt a happy camper, then why push her buttons? Im not married mind you, but im not so unaware, that if ""mom"" isnt happy, no one will be happy.Peru isnt going anywhere and same with other places for other travelers that are considering to travel.So, you may want to put it on hold until things settle down.ALso, im not sure why you are only concerned with Peru and where you are going. No one considers if the USA gets it big time, what the USA will do.Theres aways 2 sides to things and most of the times, people put on blinders and only look at the other side, not in their backyard. If we do get it, its not to say that other countries can block USA people from entering.good luck"
"OP, Imo, I'd say go and don't worry about it. But I think I only say that because I travel regularly. I know there are worse diseases that are there than one can get in Latin America. But since you are not traveling alone, it sounds like it will be tough to convince your wife. I wouldn't pressure her, and if you do go, that's all she will likely be thinking about while there."
Just make sure you get good travel insurance.
Dr. Drew said people need to calm down. Most people who get it have a mild case. This is being politicized and over blown
We leave from Australian heading to Lima and all points in Peru on 20 March. We are going. Peru has been pretty clear and we may get a reasonably clear run at Machu Picchu and Titicama etc
Peruvian President Vizcarra announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 this morning. A young man who is a LATAM pilot was traveling in Europe and began feeling sick after arriving to Lima.
"I just arrived in Peru on 3/6 on a flight that landed at 8pm. The only precaution I saw the authorities taking was most immigration staff were wearing masks. If you have concerns over the Coronavirus then consider delaying your flight or come prepared. Be aware that immigration is notoriously slow in Peru. It took me 2 hours 10 minutes to clear immigration and the immigration hall was very hot and humid with people crammed together I.e. think Petri dish. In Lima, information on the single virus case is just hitting the social media/newspapers so everyone appears to be carrying on their normal daily activities."
There are not enough tests. There have been more confirmed cases in Lima and one in Arequipa (someone that was in Europe).
"There's an up to date map from the WHO, you might want to check that out to stay up to date. In Peru there are 6 confirmed cases so far, but I'd totally agree with what has been said above. I booked all of my flights + tours for April and I'll definitely go. But hey, everyone makes that choice for themselves :)"
"got my trip booked 6 months ago, traveling with 2 kids. Dont know if I should postpone or go for it"
"CM you as an american represent a bigger risk for peruvians, than vice-versa."
"We had a trip planned for March 20 and I canceled last week. I just don’t want to get stuck in Peru with my kids. I was going to reschedule for this summer, but don’t want to risk it. So hopefully we will go spring break 2021.We got back most of our money except for Machu Picchu tickets. They said only way to change date was to come to there office in Peru!! And Latam won’t refund or change dates for flights from Lima to Cusco.Edited: 1:50 pm, March 10, 2020 "
That's good that you got back most of your money. Are they refunding most flights or did you get the international trip with travel insurance?
I found the information myself. It seems like most airlines are now offering changes or even refunds with no penalties.
Don't travel to Peru and in general to South America until this craziness stop. With just 10 cases confirmed spread in a country if 33 millions they are putting travellers in quarantine people could you imagine if the situation increase (flights Frome Europe) the airlines are not making responsible for this
Is Lima quarantining travelers from USA as of now? We are arriving next Monday March 16 for 2 weeks.
I am Italian but I live in London and I haven’t visit Italy in the past 3 months. I will travel to Lima next week from London via Bogotá. I will travel with my Italian passport. Will I have any problems?Thank you
I would cancel those trips. They haven't started to quarantine ... yet. Peruvian hospitals will be overwhelmed quickly as their capacities are much lesser compared to the US or the UK. What would you do if you get sick or if they refuse the trip back to the US or UK?
"“They haven't started to quarantine ... yet”Actually they have started to quarantine. The first were the passengers from a flight coming from Madrid. It says that pax with symptoms will be taken to a mobile hospital and others will be quarantined in their homes or hotels. https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minsa/noticia…Presently there’s 4 countries that are concerned but the list could expand. The official decree says: ““Any person entering the national territory from countries with an epidemiological background and which are on the list elaborated by the Centre for Epidemiology, Prevention and Disease Control - CDC of the Ministry of Health, such as the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic and the People's Republic of China, must be subject to a period of home isolation for fourteen (14) days. The list of countries is updated by the CDC and published on its website and that of the Ministry of Health.” The original version is here: https://cdn.www.gob.pe/uploads/document/file…As for the list of countries it would be updated on the first website I linked to.Edited: 1:32 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"I meant the OP and the other traveler's countries as they were asking about specific areas, apologies for the incomplete sentence :p"
"If you care to respond here, please let me know how it is. I'm hoping to go April 4."
"Hold off on booking. Everything may change in a month or 2. It could easily go one way or the other. I’m seeing a lot of people losing a lot of money so far because no way will you get 100% of your total purchases back. I booked a trip last September for May. Flights, hotels, train tickets, Machu Picchu tickets. I’m checking the news constantly, hoping two months is enough time for it to die off. But we don’t want to be quarantined in Perú. I’m not making any sudden moves, and I suggest you do the same. There are other factors you may need to consider. For example, El Salvador is not allowing foreigners in. I have a planned overnight layover there. Who knows what the world will see in 1, 2, 3 months? Not I."
Scientists are saying that we should prepare for the world to be very different for the next 6-12 months (isolation measures to continue or become more strict). Hopefully they are wrong
I'm booked in for May 21
"I'll go to Peru on April 10 (Lima, Huaraz and Cusco). Hope things get better. June is still so far. I don't think you will have problems."
"Hiya... supposed to fly in from UK to Peru on April 1st but have read “all flights” from Europe are suspended..?Cannot find any information on how long this is for , and currently i havent had any message from my airline. This trip planning started a year ago, and I am so close to going & now this coronovirus happens!! Feeling so disappointed, but still holding on to a little bit of hope...Havent started to cancel anything yet but trying to come to terms with the thought i may need to...Any more news on flights or quarantining..?Or is it just one of those things that nobody knows & we just have to wait and see......?"
"Here is a link to the FCO website detailing the current restrictions on flights from Europe:https:/…healthCurrently it only applies to flights from Spain, France, Italy and China The relevant paragraph detailing the restrictions:""On 11 March, the government announced that all travelers coming to Peru from Spain, France, Italy and China will have to self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival in Peru. This applies to all flights (direct or indirect), and includes transfer passengers (even if they only transited through airports in these countries).""Of course, all this could change tomorrow, but if you have a direct flight from London then you are ok. If it is routed through Madrid or Paris then you would be require to go into quarantine.Most flights from Europe are routed through Madrid and would be affected but there are some via Schiphol which I imagine are unaffected.Good luck!"
"@Creston: that was 2 days ago. Now it is the suspension of flights from Europe and Asia (official news in Spanish: https://www.gob.pe/institucion/pcm/noticias/… ) .A decree should be published later today, providing more details about the suspension of flights and access to some sites.Edited: 7:54 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I was supposed to go April 21. So far it's looking the same. I'll lose out on the Machu Picchu and Domestic flight tickets from Lima to Cusco. I haven't canceled yet, just researching and coming to terms that I might have to. I'm wondering how this will play out for people that are still traveling, especially if Peru is banning gatherings of more than 300 people."
"I’m booked for April 5th. Haven’t cancelled but another person mentioned, I’m coming to terms that I may have to. My big concern is getting stuck there. This trip was planned a while back and I paid for it all already so it’s hard to just cancel my flight and call it a night. I would have to figure out how to cancel everything else including excursions and domestic flights."
"There a notice from the Culture Ministry saying Machu Picchu tickets can be re-schedule or transferred free of charge in 2020.email: callcenter@culturacusco.gob.pe Need to include Reservation code, new dates. New names and passport/ID number is the ticket is being transferred.The email request can be made UP TO 24 hours from your original schedules visit date (printed on your ticket)"
Can you provide the link to that notice? I’m wondering if it might help convince my tour operator.
Have you tried contacting the call center yourself? Your tour operator might be trying to convince you to make the trip regardless of safety issues
The notice is in Spanish on their face book page.Here is the link:https:/…It also mentions refunds for Inca Trail permits & MP tickets. But the notice is not very clear if refunds are only for tour agencies or also for individuals.
Very helpful thanks.
"Hi IanMy trip is May 1, can you update me by IM to me about Peru policies to foreign tourists, especially from the US. I worry about 14 day policies . We are 8 adults in our 60 's coming from CaliforniaThanksTanya"
"If you are in your 60s, from California, you should not be traveling.Period.You are in the high risk group. More than 10% mortality compared to younger people. Please, don't come to Peru. You will get sick and will overwhelm the health system. The US is not prepared. What makes you think that Peru will be prepared for you?"
Currently booked for 4/12-4/21 from the US. Has there been any news about tourist sites closing? Or a ban of incoming flights from US?
"We are scheduled to depart for Sth America March 26 and I'm currently requesting credits for airline and tours. I have a family member who holds a high level medical administrative position in West Australia. Between her advice and the global responsibility now being requested by WHO and governments, we don't want to travel now. Cases of COVI-19 will very likely (she says inevitable) soar from about now in the southern hemisphere and the current cases figures we are all following on the various websites are not definitive in many countries eg lack of testing in all regional areas. It is just a flu virus and most people will not get very ill but medical and/or travel insurance won't guarantee an intensive care bed and ventilator if you're lining up with others for one if you do develop scary symptoms. Isn't the citizenship issue now as important? It is now real as to whether or not one wants to increase the chances of being a carrier and maybe passing onto those more vulnerable. We feel that if we travel it will be with trepidation, worry and now guilt and that doesn't fit with our feelings when we paid for this trip. Good luck with your decisions."
The Larco Museum in Lima is closed now until 30th March as a precaution to avoid spreading the virus. Not sure if other sites in Peru will follow.
My husband and i (we are on our 30-40s) are booked from Chicago to Lima on April 13-21. Havent booked anything besides the plane tickets. Now thinking about cancelling the trip. Keep me posted about the current situation in Peru and your travel plans!
"Hello just want to know whether you went on to your trip and/or came back? I am in similar situation - travel solo as a woman in 30s. Not too concerned about getting sick and as I usually book (spend) when I arrive so not worry about money. Just want to know how things are going there, did they close most entertainments, museums, etc as they did here in US. Thank you!!"
"You should do the sensible thing and follow experts advice about avoiding unnecessary travel. Maybe you don’t care about getting sick but others do. Don’t risk bringing more cases into the country. People have to start acting responsibly and stop being selfish. You should cancel.Edited: 11:22 am, March 14, 2020 "
Im concerned about the same issues
"I am travelling from Australia and have three weeks tour booked to Peru, Chile and Brazil, at end of March. Planned it all myself and took more than a month to research and book things. In light of recent advisory from Australian Government, to avoid unnecessary travel, I have cancelled my tour, unfortunately. The factors that led me make this decision are,1. What if I get infected and have to be in hospital in a foreign country. It's going be very unpleasant, especially as a solo traveller2. The tours always have a minimum participation limit. What if they don't meet that quota and you have days there without any activity3. What if the places I am travelling to, decide to be closed when I am there. Travelling to Peru without seeing Machu Pichu or travelling to Chile without being to Torres del Paine, doesn't make sense 4. What if Australia puts a travel ban on South America while I am there and have to put in quarantine on way back?5. Travelling without openly interacting with the community there, doesn't make sense either I will be losing several $$ worth of cancellations, but nothing comes in front of being in a situation which you can't control and have no actual peace of mind."
"Well, it is hard to say how the situation will be in June, we are not Nostradamus, but we are backpacking south america for the past few months are there are now registered cases in every country, however the numbers are quite low. Due to these low numbers nobody really pays any attention and traveling is not affected... We plan to finish our tour in Columbia in June, soon departing for Bolivia, and then Peru in April...Let's hope that the situation here will not escalate as in Europe..."
"""Well, it is hard to say how the situation will be in June, we are not Nostradamus, but we are backpacking south america for the past few months are there are now registered cases in every country, however the numbers are quite low.""It's spreading in the community; the numbers are not truly low. People are already dying in South America. Please, do the sensible thing.Why do you think ""the situation escalated in Europe""? Maybe because people thought that the ""numbers were low"" and ""traveling was not affected""?"
"I am I Peru right now (we left the US for Ecuador in January before CV was shutting g everything down). Peru does have some cases and has closed schools, banned gatherings over 1000 people and is restricting entry from some countries. We got a message from our next hotel asking for info on where we travelled from, apparently hotels are now required to obtain that information. Undoubtedly more restrictions to come"
"Italy went from 3 cases to almost 25,000 cases in THREE weeks! Go home (if you can get there) and stay there until this is all over."
Peru Declared emergency. Border closure for 15 days to start with effective 16th March
"And tour companies and hotels will not give money back, and travel insurance only talks about rescheduling... what the"
Obviously things are changing daily but at the moment they are asking me to change my flights and everything to September to keep the business I guess.
"Travel insurance will not help. The virus is a ""pre-existing"" condition. Therefore, it is not covered."
"As someone who traveled around Peru without a tour company and with advanced knowledge of the language, I would seriously consider punting any vacation plans that involve Peru until very late this year or even trying for next year. The infrastructure is significantly different than Oz (Australia), North America, Europe, etc. and in addition to persistent border shut downs you may be contending with regional airlines going out of business, protests, lack of proper medical facilities, etc.I have a pretty high risk tolerance with regards to traveling, for example, I didn't cancel my trip to Egypt the year that 2 major airplanes crashed *likely* due to terrorism, but I did end up cancelling my existing travel plans for later this spring. This global pandemic is a different type of beast and will be highly disruptive, I believe, for months to come."
"Does anyone have any updates regarding potential refunds for previously-purchased Machu Picchu tickets? I have tickets for both the citadel as well as Huayna Picchu, so I'm out about $215 if I cannot get a refund.The official website that I booked the tickets on is completely down now, so I wouldn't even know who to request the refund from.https://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/inicio"
I do not think anything in thevtourist areaxwill he back to normal until 2021
