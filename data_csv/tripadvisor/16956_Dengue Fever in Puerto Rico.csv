I didn't know that it existed in PR. I learned this from another post. I'm going back in November so i decided to look it up. for anyone wanting to know more I'm posting the link to the CDC page for it. From what I've read not a good thing to catch.Am surprised that there's really no warnings about this posted on most travel sites. http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/about/inPuerto.htmlAlso below is the weekly cases from the CDCcdc.gov/dengue/â€¦wklyrpt_eng.pdfEdited: 9 years ago 
"Hi NYYFan27,Please do not worry too much. Yes we have had an outbreak of Dengue Fever, have a look at these past posts:http://www.tripadvisor.com/SearchForums?ff=71&geo=147319&scope=2&q=Dengue+&returnTo=__2F__&sub-search.x=10&sub-search.y=12"
"We had a dengue epidemic last year (2010) and we had a ""warning"" posted on our web site from February through December (when health department declared the epidemic to be over). We caught flack from a lot of people for that warning because it might ""scare tourists"" and hurt tourism. I disagree. An informed person is our best tourist."
"""Am surprised that there's really no warnings about this posted on most travel sites."" Really? Are there warning posted on the travel sites for NY about the possible insect-borne diseases travelers to NY can catch there- Lymes, West Nile Virus, or at very least itchy Bed bug rashes etc)?There are insect borne diseases everywhere. Dengue is always around in tropical/sub tropical climates, but unless it is an epidemic, the chances of getting it are so low, it is hardly worth mentioning. There have been cases of Dengue in Florida, but no one is issuing warnings because it is not a huge threat. Same thing for PR this year.If anyone is concerned, use Deet bug spray."
