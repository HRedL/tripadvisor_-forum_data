"I know many travellers are quite concerned about the coronavirus situation in the Philippines and the impact of their travel plans and the risk of catching this virus.Unfortunately a travel forum (a group of strangers on the internet) can’t decide nor tell you if you should travel or not, and the risks of catching this contagious infection. We are not medically qualified to assess the risks.As the situation is constantly evolving please assess official resources such as your own countries Travel Advisory, Philippine Department of Health and The World Health Organisation.The following are links that can assist you to make a decision:Philippine Department of Health https://www.doh.gov.ph/2019-nCoVWorld Health Organisationhttps:/…travel-advicehttps:/…novel-coronavirus-2019So please don't ask if you should travel or not and what the risks are.I will have this added as a “sticky” thread.If you have any other useful links please post here."
"A ""sticky"" thread may have the intentions of a good idea but unfortunately it has not worked as demonstrated in the Singapore Forum in the past week."
"Global over reaction for covid-19 when influenza or the flu has a much much bigger casualty count.Good intention by the OP but given how people dont read for the answers already available even within a thread, I predict threads about this outbreak will continue to propagate."
"I'm not worried of catching the virus, i am worried that the holiday that i have been planning for two years will be cancelled. Is Lufthansa going to open the flights again? they have stopped the flights till the end of march and i want to know if they are going to cancel my flight as well so if that's the case i want a refund asap so i will book with another airline."
"I was booked RT LAX-MNL-LAX on United A/L that has now been postponed due to the virus. No problem there. I also booked a domestic flight in the Philippines with PAL. The PAL website says it is only giving credit for international flights, not domestic. To me this is not fair because of my USA to Philippines trip was postponed I cannot use my PAL domestic tickets thru no fault of my own. I just wish to receive credit for my domestic cancelled flight to use later."
