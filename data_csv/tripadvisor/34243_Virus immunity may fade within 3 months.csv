https://ca.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-immuni… html new study suggests that one vaccine shot will not be enough
There goes the herd immunity theory if that’s true.
that's what I thought pp !
It could be like the flu shot. You get it every year and covid would be added like H1N1.
Since that link doesn't seem to open try this one.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/1…
What worries me is I keep reading of an anti-vaccine movement - why anyone would be anti having a vaccine to prevent a serious illness beat me.
"<< ""why anyone would be anti having a vaccine to prevent a serious illness beat me."" >>They're against vax for polio, smallpox, meningitis, hepatitis, measles, mumps, rubella, etc, etc, etcScary what people with even a third-grade reading level can be convinced of.Edited: 5:48 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Assoc Chief of Public Health Dr Howard Njoo just emphasized that the scientific community does not expect that there will be any long lasting immunity for folks who have recovered from C19 - and that the only realistic protection will be the immunization of the general public (what is to be done about anti-vaxxers?)
Good Luck #20times
20Times why would you want to not have a vaccine to prevent catching a killer ? I remember as a child hearing of people dying from polio dyptheria and a number of others all unheard of today. I think it is you who is being arrogant by not wanting to play your part in eliminating this virus.Are you serious not minding risking carrying this virus to pass on to others?
John F ...if you take a look at the previous posts of #20times ...perhaps your question will be answered !!!!
"We should be careful not to mix up /confuse vaccine and natural immunity having been infected The Kings College research is about immunity post infection and is as has been predicted for some time by a number of eminent virologists I belive KC are going to follow this up to see if there is more / longer immunity from a more serious infectionTheir Covuid 19 App is useful for 'new' developments As far as vaccine immunity is concerned ....too many under development or at trial stage to make definitive statementsEdited: 6:49 pm, July 14, 2020 "
Just a footnote to the Kings College research ...it was a very small sample ....96 At the height of their infection 60% had a potent antibody response ....3 months later this was 17%Much more research needed ..as it is with the part played by T cells. Some research says they play an important part in fighting the virus but it is also possible that T cells can make it worse by triggering an inferior immune response On a positive note .... it would appear that so far there are no major mutations
The reference to vaccines with a possible falling immunity was about those derived from an attenuated or dead version of the Sars - Cov-2 Of an estimated 224 vaccines in development ...17 fall into this categoryIn the UK Oxford and Imperial attempts are using hi-tech RNA and adenovirus which they hope will not have falling immunity or T cell issues
#11 See what you mean.What I have noticed here and elsewhere these anti-vaxers never come back with a reason for being against vaccines. Seems they are anti because authority wants you to have a vaccine.
"I would dearly like to be able to have a safe effective vaccine,- as one of the really vulnerable population, I would really like to have the opportunity to be able to""Live"" the remaining years of my live - rather than just ""existing"" - so even if it means an annual shot - I'd do that - anything rather than going on this way ...."
Well I am sure I responded to #16 a couple of hours ago!! Surely the definition of an anti-vaxxer is someone totally against vaccines. Someone who just feels they want to see more tests regards safety is primarily for having the protection afforded by a vaccine. 20Times your post did not read you were in the latter but were very supportive of anti-vaxxers.ASO I am very much with you - I want to see some of the world (esp.Barbados) but will not spend money on UC if we are all wearing those masks
"I don’t understand why other countries are so against masks ! If you come to Barbados you will have to get used to wearing them so why not on the plane .  I know they are not fun but just as our Muslim friends get used to them as every day apparel , so have we . I forget I’m wearing mine now when I come out of a shop and have to remind myself to take it off and I certainly will be wearing one all the time I’m in the U.K. in December .  As for wearing one on the plane , well that’s surely a no brainer and much more comfortable in UC , so I don’t follow that reasoning at all . Just bring several with you and keep changing them to keep them healthy. Oh and it’s nice if the match what you are wearing lol .Edited: 2:26 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"ASO... terrible terrible terrible. I am younger..early 50s..still I feel I am wasting time. My sister and hubby just retired this spring. Mid 60s and *proof* gone are there plans and they sit home. I had planned to share Barbados with tbem in the near future. Breaks my heart. I know I am fortunate to have have some ""extra"" years but who knows if that will end up being reality.I could be misquoting- Dr Fauci but I think he said once their is 25% of the population infected and have antibodies and we have vaccinated those who will get the vaccine we should be ok. Taking into account the anti people. Catching it should be rare. Optimistically early next year we have a safe vaccine...so maybe by this time(summer) next year...it might be safe to go out again."
"I am not against wearing masks at all (I live in a condo bldg in Ontario and when I open my condo door to go out into the hallway etc, I wear a mask, as other people use the hallway too, just common courtesy nowadays)"
"Westie I am not saying they should not be worn on planes at present or if they should not be worn in shops etc. All I know is I hate wearing them and seeing several people wearing them in shops gives me a strange feeling - it is so unnatural as is, in my opinion,seeing Muslim women with their face covered. My comments regarding UC travel is imply I enjoy the whole experience from checking luggage in to collecting it at my destination - the restrictions being imposed reduces that enjoyment. Not a criticism just a personal choice.Edited: 2:55 pm, July 15, 2020 "
imply should read simply !!
John F - don't know about BA or Virgin - but AC gave up treating UC pax to drinks and nice meals since the pandemic - so just sitting there with my mask on was really not relevant to me...
