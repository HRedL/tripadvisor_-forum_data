"I need some serious help from those of you that have travelled to this beautiful island. My husband and I planned one last getaway before starting a family - we booked about 1 month ago to an all-inclusive in Mexico for August. Well then this Swine flu hits(yes I know, its still somewhat far away but I'm not sure if a ""pandemic"" will subside in that amount of time and to be honest, who knows if we will be expecting-don't want to take any risks.) - I looked into Turks and Caicos just to see if at that time there are any great deals - and of course I find one. I have ALWAYS wanted to stay here! Called the travel agent yesterday and I can't get a refund on air! ($600) So my question is....Do I take it as a wash and still go ahead with Provo? Or is that absolutely crazy? My husband is a school teacher and I'm a school social worker so we do have to work hard to save for vacations - but i want it to be an incredible one! Do you think its worth it?! I hate to ""throw money out the window"" but considering the circumstances..........."
"Honestly, I would steer clear of Mexico until I was 100% sure the epidemic had passed. And at this writing there is no assurance whatsoever that Mexico will be safe in a few months.Dr. Harvey"
"After coming here, you won't regret loosing the airfare. As soon as you take a step on the beach....the waves will wash away the memories of it!"
"I would check on the airfare again, maybe directly with the airline since they should be giving some consideration for a credit (not a refund) since it is Mexico. Hopefully you could use any credit towards airfare to TCI.Is it worth it? I would say absolutely if you are mainly going for beautiful beaches and relaxation. Both are better than Mexico imho."
"I just want to add my 2cents here. Provo is AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL and everything else people have said. It is also EXPENSIVE. I dont care how you slice it (not eating out, cooking in, etc) it is a much more expensive destination than Mexico, and def more than an AI in Mexico.As long as you are prepared money wise to handle the prices, then I say GO FOR IT.As you are already losing a hunk of change, and you mention that you work hard to save for vacation, I would just want to make sure you get the vacation that you want.In other words, I have ALWAYS wanted to go to Tahiti and I'm sure its amzing and beautiful, but I dont have the $$ to pull it off yet. Not trying to discourage you, just trying to keep it honest.Provo is amazing, and if you do decide to come, I am sure you will fall in love like the rest of us."
"Thanks for all your responses...I'm definitely leaning towards going! Fluffy k - i appreciate your honesty! We would have to add in food so I'm figuring and extra 1,000 which is fine - It just stinks to have to lose 600, but I love tvtoq's response - ""the waves will wash away the memories of it"" :)"
"I agree, prices are waaaaay different. Had friends visit who typically go to Mexico - they were a bit shellshocked at the prices and ended up splitting a lot of meals. $15-$30 for breakfast$30 - $60 for lunch$60 - $150 for dinner None of that includes drinks- maybe a glass of wine at dinner on the $150 end.Add in a travel excursion, a rental car or cabs, housekeeping tips, drinks at the bar and tips, bottled waters on the beach, tips at the resort for staff, etc., etc., It is a beautiful place, and I think you will enjoy it - just be prepared for the prices."
I agree with Sig's prices
"I'm not sure where in CT you're from, but I didn't find the prices in Provo to be so ridiculous at all. I think if you consider your local home restaurants - if you were to eat out every day - all meals, it would be just about the same cost. Of course at home you may not dine as 'fine' as you would on vacation - but that's the point of a holiday isn't it? To treat yourself to something special. If you're in a full kitchen unit - eating out all three meals isn't necessary. Shopping in the grocery store isn't so outrageous. I think that it's all relative. To me, something may not be alot of money - to you it MIGHT be alot. I don't think that $300 for an amazing dinner out is so outrageous. Keep in mind - you DO NOT have to spend a ton of money down there to have great meals! Coco Bistro, Mango Reef, Hemingways - all come with excellent food and atmosphere without breaking the bank per se. Come up with a realistic budget (are you really going to eat out three meals every day?) Also - some people have higher meal tabs due to alcohol consuption - which is a huge part of the bill. Are you bid drinkers that have to be trashed all day long with every meal? Then right there - you're saving.As far as the swine flu goes, when and IF...(big IF)they restrict any travel - your money will be refunded.Here is a great source for information:http://www.who.int/en/Please note the following excerpt that I found to be interesting: 1 May 2009 -- WHO is not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of the influenza A(H1N1) virus. Today, international travel moves rapidly, with large numbers of individuals visiting various parts of the world. Limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading, but would be highly disruptive to the global community.If getting to Provo is your goal before a family, then by all means - I'd choose it over Mexico. You're comparing apples to oranges. Mexico is not an island, and it's quite evident no matter where you go. Even in Cozumel and Isla Mujeres...it's just got a bigger vibe."
I agree with Sherilynn.You can do meals quite reasonably in Turks & Caicos.That is the great thing about the condos. We do our big meal at lunch with exception of maybe couple of dinners out.Like to see the water & at dinner you cannot. Don't like going to bed after a big meal so we have a light dinner or ice cream sundae for dinner at night.Agree Hemmingway's & Mango Reef same prices as home.We buy a case of Turks Head when we arrive too.I'm usually too tired after beach all day to even get dressed at night for dinner & don't really like getting out of beach shorts after having to dress for work.
"I would check with your airline, for I saw this morning that they were waiving the fee for changing flights because of this issue. Don't give up hope of getting to Provo, for I just returned after my first visit and it is beautiful. Good luck!"
"LLH -- We, too, had a trip planned for Mexico ... to leave in TWO weeks. Regretably, we decided to cancel it and are going to Turks & Caicos ... our first trip here. We were flying to Mexico on American. It was not a part of a ""package"" ... just the flight. Anyway, American is giving us full credit for our flights in the form of a voucher. We have up to a year to book another flight with American and use them. And, the flight can be anywhere that American flies, up to the cost of our previous trip. I thought that this was very accommodating of American. Not sure what airline you were flying, but you might want to call them directly and see if you can get some kind of credit. Most airlines seem to be working with their customers these days. Good Luck. P.S. I'm sad that our Mexico trip got canceled, but I'm excited about going to Turks & Caicos. I will be watching this board for tips for our trip!"
"TCI will provide you with a much nicer (IMO) vacation than at an AI in Mexico. Not to dish Mexico, there are many beautiful resorts, but sometimes the AI are not the nicest.TCI is all about relaxation and the beach.A condo rental will afford you the ability to cook in a couple of nights and dine out when you want to.We usually cook in one night and dine out the rest of the time. When the suites are so nice, we like to chill one evening in. I would check with the airline also about the ability to change your flights to another destination. I think that under the circumstances, they might be more flexible.And with the economy, most TCI resorts are offering some incentives.Welcome to ""our"" island and I am sure you will love it as much as the rest of us.Mike"
"We traveled with a family of five and spent $150 for the most expensive dinner. That usually included a beer or drink for two. We did not go to the high end restaurants but had really good food at each place we ate. Breakfast was cereal and lunch was a ham and cheese or pbj plus snacks. We ate out every night and had good food at each place. But, you could blow a ton of money if you don't read the menus before you go. Go to the Conch Shack if you go! "
"LLH,I'll chime in here for the lower restaurant prices. I'm not sure where you ate, Fluffy k, but we spent much less than you for an average B, L or Dinner. Usually with a couple of Turks Heads as well. Even our big night out to Coco Bistro only ran about $100 before tip, and that was with wine and dessert for our daughter. We also definitely took advantage of the kitchen in our suite to make our own meals several times during the week.As for the airfare, we had to cancel a trip to Mexico 2 years ago when Hurricane Dean was a Cat 5 headed for Cozumel. Continental Airlines refused to refund our plane fare in cash and instead issued us vouchers. At first we were pretty upset because we couldn't plan another trip within the year's time they give you to use the voucher. However, we discovered that we could sell the vouchers. We cut about 20% off the face value of each voucher and listed them on Craig's List - took less than a week to sell them all. I bet you will be able to get your airline to switch you from Mexico to T&C, but if they don't fly there or will only give you a voucher, make sure it is transferable. Then you can recoup most of your money and help out a fellow traveler at the same time!Just so you know, Cozumel was our back-up destination after we couldn't make it to Provo that year. When the hurricane came and we had to cancel Cozumel too, I couldn't believe I had two beach vacations slip away in the same summer. But fate knew what it was doing -- even though we missed the beach totally that summer, it allowed us to re-group and we ended up in Provo the following year. I would never plan a special getaway to Mexico if Provo is possible. I'm not dissing Mexico; it's great for what it is. But Provo is a whole other world. Have a great time wherever you go!"
Thanks so much for all the replies - some really great info! After all the positive posts I'm feeling pretty confident in my decision to book. I'm also going to keep track of the upcoming airline policies-I'm hoping something will come of it....
"For what it's worth, our family of four (two children) spend an average of $180 per day on food and beverage.Breakfast is included with our room, and we usually combine some upscale resort dining with authentic local restaurants, and a few kids' meals served at the condo.Like most destinations, if we ate EVERY meal at the resort and tourist-oriented restaurants, we could easily spend $3-400 per day.Breaking it up a bit makes dining much more interesting <IMO> and cost efficient."
"With regard to your air,I can't imagine that you cannot pay a change fee (plus the difference between the two fares) and use your tickets for another trip. If you are on a carrier that does not fly to TCI, or anywhere in the Caribbean, I would go somewhere the airline does fly this year, unless you know you can reuse the tickets within the specified period applicable. As much as I love TCI(it's the only place we vacation now) the islands will be there for another trip."
"SEashell-We ate at Coyaba, Magnolia, Las Brisas, Da Conch Shack, Coco Bistro, Aqua, Sharkbite and Bay Bistro.I think its a silly point to try and say the island is not expensive. Its an island, all islands are relatively expensive as the price to import in many of the goods that are provided on the island.While I am not in disagreement that there ARE more affordable options on the island in relative to other options on the island, I would certainly not say that Provo is ""cheap"" like Mexico or even Miami or NYC.Thats all my point was to the poster...Just to be prepared is all."
"We spent last Thanksgiving in Miami Beach (Fontainbleau Hotel), and fluffy's right. When comparing ""apples with apples,"" Provo's upscale resorts and restaurants can be just as expensive at MB's.e.g., a mixed drink at the Fontainbleau bar costs $14 -- similar to ordering a drink at The Regent Palms or Grace Bay Club. Also, $30-50 entrees are not uncommon for the upscale and resort restaurants at both destinations.As fluffy said, there are other options, but be prepared for some sticker shock if you care to indulge."
"No, you're not crazy. You will have a wonderful time in turks and caicos. I would think that many of us forumulites are in the same boat you are financially. We prioritize and get creative when it comes to vacations you can't beat providenciales. My husband and I repeated our vows for our 25th on grace bay. Just me my husband and the pastor. Loved it! You can be a busy as you want, we prefer to take advantage or all the water sports. We are planning on another trip the end of the month. Have fun with your husband after all you Earned it."
