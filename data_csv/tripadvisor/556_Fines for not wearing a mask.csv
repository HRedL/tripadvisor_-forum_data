"People not wearing a mask in public spaces in the municipality of Benito Juarez (where Cancun is located) could be fined up to 4000 pesos...Report in Spanish: https://www.poresto.net/quintana-roo/2020/7/…Translation: https://translate.google.com/translate…Edited: 8:56 pm, July 16, 2020 "
"I for one, am happy to hear this!"
Good.
"Personally I absolutely hate wearing a face mask. It's just plan miserable with the high levels of heat and humidity these days. But I do it. So I think this is great. There are far too many people who don't wear them. Anytime I'm out I see large groups of resort workers waiting for their transportation to work and the majority aren't wearing masks. They may be wearing them at work but they aren't when out and about downtown. Of course, it's not just the resort workers who don't wear them. I was just using them as an example because I see it frequently. Something has to be done to slow the spread of we will never get to yellow. And, I got one, an more than ready to get to yellow. I'd really want to go to the beach, lol."
Or a fine up to 9000 pesos according to Riviera Maya News...https:/…2020.html
"And it's not just failure to wear a facemask. It's failure to observe social distancing and refusal to use sanitizing gel when in public. The city council also approved the sanction of the offender being placed under arrest for up to 36 hours. https://translate.google.com/translate…Edited: 10:32 am, July 17, 2020 "
"Apologies to those who sent me messages asking if the fines applied to tourists in the hotel zone. It saves me a bit of time by answering the question here instead of responding to each individual message. Yes. Tourists can and will be subject to sanctions the same as locals for violating the protocols when I'm public. That includes in the hotel zone and when using transportation such as buses, taxis and private transportation services."
Just out of curiosity why would you assume that because you’re a tourist you’re exempt from the regulations? If a tourist comes to your town and breaks the law Do they get away with it because they’re a tourist? If so you live in a very strange placeWear your mask. You shouldn’t even need to be told you’re going to be fined to do the right thing. But if that’s what it takes I’m all for it
"No idea, Carol. But based on my inbox this morning at least 12 people wanted confirmation that tourists were exempt from being fined as long as they stayed in the hotel zone."
They may be from states that do not require masks. Here in IL they’ve been required for months. I’m sorry to say I’m actually getting used to it from so much wearing!!
I thought this is valid since April at least here in Playa Del Carmen. So more than 3 months the case. Not sure why they make this as something new when it was even enforced in the past months. Good so and I absolutely support it not just here but globally.
"Wearing masks has been mandatory for the past few months, but there wasn't a penalty for not wearing one. Now there is in the municipality of Benito Juarez. Still no penalty in Solidaridad (the municipality where Playa del Carmen is located)."
Throw the book at em!
"From Riviera Maya News today...QUOTEFines, arrests for not wearing masks now legal in CancunBy Riviera Maya News on July 27, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — Modifications to a law will now allow authorities to be able to fine anyone not complying with municipal health requirements such as healthy distancing and the wearing of a mouth mask in public.Modifications to the Bando de Policía y Buen Gobierno de Benito Juárez in the Periódico Oficial del Estado was made official over the weekend, now enabling authorities to hand out fines for those found in noncompliance.With this, municipal authorities may impose a fine of up to 3,475 pesos and/or an arrest of up to 36 hours in the Municipal Retention Center (El Torito).UNQUOTEFull report: https:/…2020.html"
"For anyone who needs a conversion and a wake up 4,000 pesos equates to about 200 dollars US. You can buy a large # of masks for 4,000 pesos in Mexico or $200 in the US. So if you are dumb enough to not wear a mask, are you dumb enough to give that amount of money away???"
"""So if you are dumb enough to not wear a mask, are you dumb enough to give that amount of money away???""I'm guess, the answer to this question is, yes......"
"""Just out of curiosity why would you assume that because you’re a tourist you’re exempt from the regulations?""I imagine it has a lot more to do with being an American than being a tourist. While we do have rules here on a state-by-state basis, they're not being enforced, and there are virtually no repercussions for failing to wear a mask. So, while many of us Americans do wear the masks (voluntarily or not), I imagine most of the ""tourists"" who questioned the policy were Americans. Because, you know, we're special."
"They should also be enforced within the resorts. I have seen so many pictures of tourists putting the lives of the resort workers in danger by not wearing a mask or social distancing. Such a selfish act. I can understand not wearing one outside at the beach or pool if social distancing, but otherwise just not safe these days."
"Tourists also imagine they’re special and exempt because many operate under the fantasy that, as long as staff are masked, they are protected. The number from hot spots who feel this is shocking...as if hotel staff is who to fear, rather than them! I wish officials would make spot visits to resort lobbies and fine guests and the resorts."
"I’m with you Reviewer. I’ll be in resort a soon. I’ve already decided that I’m just going to be rude. If you’re not wearing a mask and you’re in line at the bar behind me for example I will turn around and ask you to back off. If you come to close to me and you’re not wearing a mask I will ask you to move away. I don’t want what these idiots are giving away. And I also think it’s incredibly rude and arrogant to expect the staff to wear protective gear to take care of us, but we don’t have to do anything in return. What it shows you is there a lot of tourist or self-centered rude people. Do you want a definition of ugly American and you’re not wearing a mask? See a mirror  Unless you are laying on your lounge chair, in the pool or the ocean, or eating or drinking, you need to be wearing a mask. Come on protect those people who are giving you such good serviceEdited: 7:54 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Carol,Asking people to give you space is a good idea."
"Perhaps it is time for responsible tourists to chastise the irresponsible tourists. Most people do care, they just do not think. Carol A, when you do visit cheerlead the mask wearing by tourists."
"So you guys think people come here to be preached at? I have to laugh. What a joke. You do what you want and everyone else will do what they want. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.PS if a stranger tries to confront me anywhere about not wearing a mask, they've got another thing coming.Edited: 10:40 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Starting August 3, Cancun will be activating a new Covid React Police Team. Their sole responsibility will be to enforce new law requiring masks. I'm told they will be stationed all throughout the city (including the hotel zone) and will also be responsible for ensuring that large gatherings of people do not occur. He's a bit of info on this from today's Riviera Maya News:https:/…2020.html"
"Mikey (from FL, of course),I have no intention of preaching to or chastising anyone. I do like Carol’s idea of politely asking for a little distance if necessary. I’ve had to do that at home. No one has been the slightest bit put off when it’s said nicely."
"Reviewer, you're absolutely correct. I make it a point to keep a great distance between others."
Reviewermaryland - I think that we do not understand. Mikey is from Fla where there is no problem with people not wearing masks. As the world knows there is no COVID19 problem in Fla and people there never think about wearing masks. I am sure that he is a nice person and when he realizes that there is a COVID19 problem in Cancun he will be glad to wear a mask.

After all you should ignore laws as you don’t like. Yeah that’s going to work well. I’m always want to hear trip report about the inside of a Mexican jail can’t wait for Mikey’s report
"""So you guys think people come here to be preached at? I have to laugh. What a joke. You do what you want and everyone else will do what they want. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.PS if a stranger tries to confront me anywhere about not wearing a mask, they've got another thing coming.""@Mikey Listen you rude disrespectful *****. I suggest you don´t come down here because you will be asking for problems and I mean huge problems if you don´t play by the rules set here. If you don´t plan to do social distancing and don´t plan to wear a mask you will try the shade of Mexican jail. There are laws here! What makes you think it´s not up to me or us? Sure it is! You won´t be ALLOWED to do what you want! And trust me, I will be the first one looking for you to report you and get behind bars. Don´t get me wrong. If I see anyone without a mask outside, I approach that person and politely ask to put on a mask. If that person decides to decline, be rude or even aggressive, then I take steps that will end this in a matter of seconds and then police takes it from there. I have done that and will do it any time again. Actually I am inviting you to come and come as soon as possible. I can´t wait when you will be confronted here anywhere, at the airport, at a taxi or in the hotel and show your American ego how it´s done the right way outside of your country. My friend anywhere you stick your ugly arogant junkie face out you will be required to wear a mask. If not, then you won´t be let in to anywhere and people won´t mess around with you and call the police. There are citizens who want to see responsible tourists here and if that is not the case bye bye, you will be asked to leave very quickly with a lot less money and maybe jail experience. People warned you and people know where you are planning to stay so please take it seriously because I do. You will not even arrive to Mexico without a mask do you realise that?!"
"You guys are nothing but Bullies. You tried to be nice to Mikey (from Florida) in a snarky way. Then once one person started you all piled on. What the heck is wrong with you ppl? I'm not gonna debate any of you, but it's no wonder kids are bullied. Look how the adults act, wonder where they get it from. Disgusting"

IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.PS if a stranger tries to confront me anywhere about not wearing a mask, they've got another thing coming.”That was Mikey’s first post on this thread lest anyone be confused by yet another of Clmeade’s “alternative facts” posts."
You just cannot help yourself can you? You definitely take the fun out of Trip Advisor. Carry on....
"I don´t understand how someone can be on the side of Mikey? Are you out of your minds? Like really, in your home country you also break the laws? When something is mandatory down here you all will respect that or you will have to take responsibility for such actions. This is not a thing of advice. THIS IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR EVERYBODY TO WEAR A FACE MASK IN CANCUN! Which part you don´t understand? Obey the f*****g rules and laws. Simple as that and then we don´t have a problem. But if one is a witness of crime what do you do? You report it and make sure it doesn´t happen again. So please tell me where I am wrong and where Mikey is right with what he wrote? Have you read the article? Yes sure, you have the right to disagree but that´s it. Nothing more. Don´t come if you don´t agree."
"For those who think they will not be wearing a face mask here in Cancun and who will not be practicing social distancing, read this article please to finally admit we take it seriously down here and it is not a joke or anybody being bullied. Disgusting are those who can´t follow a simple requirement in a pandemic!https:/…2020.html@LeoinMD, man I feel good knowing I have all the authorities behind me on this and that I help them out as much as I can to spread awareness and quickly report those who break the laws."
"I am hoping that if Mikey and Cimeade visit the area, and mask wearing is the law, they'll follow the law of the country they're visiting. Otherwise, why vist? A visit, a vacation is voluntary, obeying a country's law is not.Stay in the United States if you don't like the rules, simple as that.Edited: 10:31 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"The ""good"" old saying so often heard in the USA, ""go back to your home country!"" It looks to be here more like ""stay in your home country"" and the advice from health experts is not far away from this. They say ""stay at home"". Are they bullies? Of course not. They want to keep me, you, all of us safe.Tourists are welcome under one condition and that is to strictly adhere to all the laws, rules and health protocols mandatory in Mexico. If not, then really stay at home and don´t bother to even dare think coming down here.Edited: 11:07 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Paul, there was a recent confrontation in a dog park where a woman reportedly used pepper spray or similar against a man who was not wearing a mask.When I read one of your earlier dissertations, that is what it sounded like. Assault people not wearing a placebo mask.If you want to save people, quarantine those who are vulnerable...and that is not most people. Stop this charade of masks and social distancing."
"Copilot please educate yourself and stop writing nonsense. EVERYBODY is vulnerable. It is not just the old people. Anybody can get infected and die. Read how the life of those who got the virus and did not have to be in hospital changed and how they are messed up now and for the rest of their lives. You look to be one of those who claim Earth is flat and not round. And the story with the pepper spray is BS. Sure it was an assault, I would use that as a defense instead if I were attacked by some jerk who gets aggressive when I ask him to put the mask on his face and certainly not to force him to wear a mask even though honestly sometimes I must say it comes to my mind when I am angry. Lastly, laws are laws and most of the world uses masks for a reason. Dumb idiots refuse them because they are just what they are. Please educate yourself, know how this sh*t is transmitted and why you NEED to wear a mask even if you don´t feel sick. It is spread by tiny droplets from your mouth and nose. There are asymptomatic carriers of this disease! So the mask protect others and gets the droplets trapped inside and not spread so easily out. I am not here to give you lessons that even a small child understands. Go get the virus, forget about the mask and let us all know how it went if that is what you are asking for. All the experts and educated people are wrong, but you are right. Bravo."
""" Anybody can get infected and die.""That is clearly wrong. It is largely age related and impacted by certain underlying medical conditions.That is why people in those risk groups need to take 100% responsibility for avoiding the virus which may mean 100% quarantine or equivalent protective measures.The ineptness of ""the medical community"" is a factor in the deaths of thousands of people.As I mentioned before, you should organize everyone in the area and demand that everything be shut down until the virus is no longer a threat."

"@42 : No, it is a collective responsibility and a matter of public health....and it is not just age related. Follow the law and respect your hosts or stay home. People should not have to lock down because of selfish idiots.Covid is not just about death rates. I have two friends one in her mid 30s and the other early 40s that caught it in March, both were in very good physical shape, slim, fit people, trekking all around the world and running semi-marathons in very good times. They got sick but not sick enough to be hospitalized. They are now Covid free but they are completely messed up: climbing the stairs in their house sends their heart racing at about 160 pulse per minute and they are always exhausted, unable to do anything, including returning to work. Doctors don't know how long this will last.

"Paul S, I just don't agree with the attacks. It seems that on every thread, the same ppl are calling ppl names and as I said, once one starts, everyone piles on. Yes, I wear a mask. Do I like it...NO! But I do it or I stay home. If you aren't involved with the attacks that go on all the time here, then no worries. If you are, maybe YOU could use a little reflection.

"Co-Pilot Ref # 42 I don't usually quote statistics as some one comes back with other stats and it ends as two CPAs tossing figures. That said I do just differ with you on your statement that older people are the bullseye for COVID19. Most released data has about as many if not more people of various age groups succumbing to this virus than the older ones. At first that was the thought, but I believe that you are still sitting right seat in a C-47 while the rest of us are in jets.Oh, I did have time in the left seat of a C-47, but moved on to much faster, but not better things."
It's hardly rocket science that you can get COVID-19 via virus particles that land on the eye. Not sure why he is making a point about this now.
"Sorry CalmJohn, the deaths are FAR from evenly distributed throughout the various age groups. Do some research of your own instead of watching CNN. CoPilot is correct the mask is a security blanket for people who are afraid. It's like putting up a chain link fence to keep the mosquitoes out. I will not violate the laws of Mexico so I'll be saving the 10 grand that I spend every winter on multiple trips to Mexico because I'm not spending my vacation wearing a rag over my face to make people who are scared feel better, https:/…AgeAndSex"
"Gotta love how all it takes is a little propaganda to convince people that medical facemasks are a dangerous placebo. It’s crazy how zero medical professionals have experienced any problems from wearing them since they were invented, eh folks?!Just for the record, covid rides on water droplets that do not generally fit through mask fibers. While it’s not 100% effective in prevention, it definitely helps. The only place you can find information to the contrary are on propaganda sites like Info Wars, Rush, and Fox, although even Fox are starting to take their heads out of the sand at this point.Anti-maskers absolutely deserve to be shamed, online and in public. They are a danger to the world, as they are programmed to only consume and repeat harmful nonsense. They do not deserve to be engaged with otherwise, as they will reject any truth that doesn’t conform to their narrative, and insultingly condescend you in the process. Let them get their tickets, let them get kicked out, let them cry their way onto the next viral Karen video. Don’t argue with them, let the police do their job. They’ve already admitted that they won’t wear a madk under any circumstances in Mexico, and that means they won’t be there, which is great news for the rest of us. They can stay home listening to Ben Shapiro whine about stuff while they clutch their gun tightly, imagining bald eagles flying overhead while they sing the national anthem, fantasizing about being persecuted."
"Lucky, I think if you read my comment again, I said that they were more evenly distributed."
"Chris- In my state we are struggling with outbreaks in nursing homes. All employees have to have a mask on to enter the building and no visitors are allowed. If the masks are so effective how do the residents keep catching the Jin Ping virus? I never said that I wouldn't wear a mask under any mandate in Mexico. I simply stated that I'm not going to spend a lot of money to go on vacation this winter and spend it wearing a rag on my face so I will stay home. Here in Iowa I can go about anywhere except Menards or Walmart with no mask. We've been on vacation this week and we spent a few days down at Lake of the Ozarks. If the 'Rona was so dangerous this should be Covid central. Thousands of people at lakeside bars with pool bars, not a mask in sight and no employees with masks. It's been like this since Memorial day. According to CNN every employee of these bars and half their families should be dead. Camden County Missouri has had a measly 280 confirmed Covid-19 cases. Apparently you can be around other people with no mask especially outside and not die of the 'Rona."
"Good Lord, you can’t fix stupid."
"Funny, I think you are stupid but we can agree to disagree. Spend hours doing your own research like I have and you might not believe everything that you hear on CNN. And news flash, people die every day. It's a fact of life. We are keeping children from learning when statistics show that they have basically zero risk of dying from Covid.Edited: 9:45 pm, August 01, 2020 "

I said 2 months ago I wouldn’t be going back to Mexico until I didn’t have to wear a mask or listen to someone yelling at me to social distance and I got attacked. That’s not a vacation to me. That’s why I am choosing not to go until this Covid settles down.
"""Copilot, your stupidity keeps making me wonder more and more about who and what is brainwashing you but as I said and I repeat - EDUCATE YOURSELF and stop writing BS and making look americans as idiots.""Quote from Paul S. Paul, as I mentioned before. Lobby the Mexican government to shut down all air travel from the US. Maybe from all countries. Then let us know how people fare in the coming months. Document how many people are out of work. No way to pay rent or buy food. Keep track of all the businesses that close."
"Dear Paul S. Do a little research about how Sweden has handled this. No lockdowns, no school closures, no masks, bars and restaurants still open. They fared worse than some European countries that locked down and better than many European countries that locked down. If the vaccine is ineffective (likely it will be) the Swedes will already have herd immunity and their economy will be humming along while other countries are still hiding in their basements wearing their masks delaying the inevitable. Sincerely, ""The Guy Above You"""
Dear Lucky. Maybe you should do more research on Sweden and their death rate. Not so good.
Most of the deaths in Sweden were nursing homes. The Swedish government admits that they could have done a better job protecting the nursing home residents. We've had a couple of states (New York and New Jersey) that have really skewed the death rate because they didn't properly protect nursing home residents.
Sweden's 'herd immunity' hopes are fading as only a small fraction of the population has coronavirus antibodieshttps:/…
"Lucky,Further, only 20% of deaths in NY were from nursing homes (residents and staff) unlike Iowa, for example, who I guess “didn’t properly protect the nursing homes” with 53% of state deaths from nursing homes. Overall, the numbers across the country are at about 40%, do not just include the elderly, and vary widely from state to state. In Maryland, where the numbers among nursing home staff and residents were initially very high when this (novel) virus hit, leading to a higher rate, there has been a far better understanding of containment and proper safety protocols per public health guidelines since that has made for very few cases since the early weeks. Our numbers were high, but we followed the science in our state including masks and other appropriate PPE, and now nursing home deaths from Covid-19 are rare. Also, Sweden has one of the highest Covid death rates relative to population size in Europe.https:/…coronavirus-nursing-homes.html"
"People,This is a travel site.Let's get back to the question.Mexico wants you to wear facemasks.Case closed.Do not go to Mexico if you are not prepared torespect their laws."
"And if you don’t wear a mask, and you get to go to jail, please post trip report. I’ve always wanted to hear about how stupid tourists are treated in a Mexican jail because they thought they were above the law. Oh and they expect to be paid for those fines at the time they find you, so be sure you carry a lot of pesos in your pocket. They aren’t gullible enough to believe the Americans are going to mail them money after they get home"
Agree gle...enough rhetoric...
"lucky9862 please don´t pick one example and make it as an example for everything and making it look it is the right approach when it isn´t. Sweden is just one example a failed example, but look at Brazil where they also thought they can ride it out. And the reality? That is more likely what the world would look like if there were no lockdowns and shut downs. The majority proved it is not just the right way but only way to get it under control. Forget about Sweden. USA is aksing to be isolated in the world and have ban on people arriving from there to other countries. So I suggest everybody to be reasonable and respect what is common sense and the advice from experts.Copilot you are only focused on me and my posts, but read what others have to say to you too and then you will finally see I am not alone, but you are alone with your stupid ideas and way of handling this pandemic. When you contract the virus one day and I never wish it to anyone, then you will change your mind and admit how dumb you were or even worse when somebody you know very well dies of it. This is no joke and all people who don´t take it seriously and endanger others should be penalised in some way, repreated offense should be prosecuted and sent to jail because I had enough of this. I lost all toleracne to such people, lost all my patience through the months this goes on and america needs to get it under control fast, very fast and guess what guys, it will be done by force, so all will start to wear masks and soon you won´t be even able to get out without a mask. 90% of the world lives like that since 4 months just one nation and country, actually a few don´t get it. Now back to the topic, yes Mexico takes it seriously and you all who refuse to put on a damn mask stay home and don´t go anywhere. Still I haven´t got an answer why it is such a problem to put on a mask you all anti facemask people??? Really what´s the problem? As far as I know face masks are also mandatory in the US in some states so just a matter of time when it will be mandatory everywhere. I can´t wait to see that. Refusing will maybe give a chance to more police brutality. What a perfect recipe for desaster. Who wants what will get it. Simple as that. So asking for trouble is not a good idea. Stay out of Mexico and we are all good!"
"""Oh and they expect to be paid for those fines at the time they find you, so be sure you carry a lot of pesos in your pocket. They aren’t gullible enough to believe the Americans are going to mail them money after they get home""The way they seem to be handling it is they take the person before an Administrative Judge and the fine is imposed. You pay it then (or call someone to bring it to you) or if you can't pay, you're taken to El Torito. Jail. The appearance before the Judge is NOT for arguments. You are guilty by just being there. It's strictly to ensure the fine is pay and a bribe is not. No getting out of this one, folks. A $20USD to the police won't do it. At least here in Cancun it's being taken very seriously."
"Paul- Unless they come up with an effective vaccine that works (and they likely won't) 60-70 percent of people are going to have to get this before we achieve herd immunity and it goes away. Would you rather hurt the economy like we have or destroy the economy but shutting everything down and hiding in our basement wearing masks for years just to delay the inevitable. The whole concept was to flatten the curve to make sure that hospitals did not get overwhelmed. For the most that has been achieved outside of a few instances. Even in NYC they brought that giant hospital ship in and never even used it.. We have 3.3 million people in Iowa and currently have 231 people hospitalized with Covid in the entire state, 75 of which are in the ICU. Even those numbers you have to take with a grain of salt. My wife works in surgery at a large hospital. Last week they did surgery on a Covid positive patient because the patient had an aggressive form of cancer and the surgeon did not want to make the patient wait 2 weeks. The patient was young and barely had any symptoms, he was only tested because he was having surgery. Because he had to stay in the hospital overnight he was considered a ""hospitalized Covid patient"" even though he would have never sought medical care if not for his cancer.Edited: 5:15 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"Seriously, just wear the flippin' masks where and when expected to. If the authorities in Mexico have laid down rules and recommendations abide by them. If not, stay the heck home wherever that may be and for good measure abide by their rules at a minimum regarding this Novel Coronavirus."

"Not trying to weigh into the mask debate which the numbers clearly speak for themselves that they don't work because in Fla 95% of the people are wearing them and the numbers keep going up not to mention that they are not an end game solution, but I digress. In the US we don't worry so much with stupid laws because much like speeding, a mask law is more of a suggestion than a jailable offense, I would be less likely to press my luck and challenge authorities. Undoubtedly the police have had a huge mordita loss from the world of traffic scams so it would only make sense for an enterprising officer to seek out maskless tourist for a good shake down. Hopefully by my next planned trip in November things will have normalized or maybe I'll delay my trip."

"@Sungod wearing a face mask is not the only thing one needs to follow to not contract the virus. There are other also not less important things to do. Maybe even more important is to practice social distancing. Avoid crowds, avoid people, stay at home, sanitise your hands frequently, don´t touch your face, specially not your nose, mouth, eyes. What is the purpose to wear a mask in the public but then a few hours later participate on a stupid party with nobody having a mask, 90% of people drunk AF and forgeting about even the basic common sense to protect yourself from any harm? This is the thing. If people will follow all the advice there is and that is first of all to avoid people or places with lots of people then it will work. It won´t stop the contagion, but will keep it under control as much as possible. Yes you may argue that you have to go to work, you have to go shopping, but you don´t have to go and sit in a bar or restaurant, you don´t have to fly in an airplane, you don´t have to go to a party or a beach or anywhere with a larger concentration of people. Regarding shopping? Here in Mexico Walmart and all other stores introduced back in march a rule that only one person from a family is allowed to get inside. The other rule is that they limit the ammount of people that are inside. So Walmart had like a maximum of 250 people at one time as a maximum limit to be allowed inside. Others had to wait outside. It still is in effect today. So they make it safer for me and make social distancing easier also where it would not be easy. This is how it should be. And if I see somebody neglecting all this and not giving a damn about wearing a mask and following these practices, then we have a problem and a big problem where it gets most of the time very personal and even physical. All I see from the news in the USA is that people get attacked by those who refuse to wear a mask if they are asked to do so. Well I am the other type, it would end bad for those who would want to attack me, because I will first. I get very agressive if I see such behavior. Fortunately I had not a single problem with the locals and mexicans here, but that can´t be said about gringos mainly from the US. I said to them what is mandatory here and you can all guess what the answer was. A hint it was the F word and they tgought I will leave it that way. What a mistake. i wen´t on to repeat it in not a polite way anymore. Long story short, I tested out my pepper spray and they wished they had a mask because they were breathless for at least half an hour. They thought they can attack me and my friends just like they do in their home country and there will be no defense or counter attack? Is time to step up the game and teach those violators and agressive fools a lesson. I was polite and nice when I reminded them what they are forgeting and what awaits them if not doing so. So basicaly that´s it. I am not doing anything wrong here, just asking all tourists to be mindful, respect the laws and rules and policies in a foreign country and all will be good. They will have a good holiday. But if one asks for trouble he will soon find himself in it. There is a guy in this forum who is a perfect example for doing everything to get in trouble."
95% of people in Florida wearing masks? Very funny.
"sunngod.... in Fla 95% of the people are wearing masks,,??????can you give us all a link so we can check these facts,,,LOLthanks"
"No links, but I can tell you from first hand information. Just because there is not state mandate, doesn't mean is isn't happening. Pretty much all business have mask policies. South Florida is even more strict. What you see on Facebook and the news isn't always accurate. Merely being on the internet doesn't make it fact."
"sunngod just because you say it ""doesn't make it fact."",,,"
Here you go babaloo - https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080… Now it is is true because it is a link where I say it is true.

Whether we agree with Lucky (He hasn't been on the forum long) or Co-Pilot (who has been on for an extended period and has earned his wings on many subjects) as long as they stay with their opinions of a subject we can disagree, but I think that it can be done in a more gentlemanly like manner. Shall we dispense with the posturing and attempt to provide useful information."
"Sungod - Where did all of these newbies, who think that they know everything, come from? I think that the fine should doubled. Not to be argumentative as to if or if not the masks help, but because it is the law in Mexico. I haven't read where anyone has been forced to go to anywhere in Mexico. If the local police take advantage of the situation, again that is Mexico and if you don't like it vacation somewhere else.Edited: 6:40 pm, August 03, 2020 "
Calmjohn I agree and I agree my problem is that I get easily provoked and a bit too agressive then. But Copilot lost all credibility with his point of view that is not just against common sense but against all the people I have great respect and want to keep us safe. Mikey is the guy who deserves to get people like me on top of him to keep him honest and in check or at bay as we say. Then somebody mentioned racism in this thread and I keep out of that. I focus on what is here in Mexico and what the local guidelines are in regards to covid-19 and if some think they are above the law then I am here to prove them wrong or at least give them a hard time.

"Paul S, in your opinion, if an American comes and follows all the rules are you okay with that? Do you think we should stay home. I am honestly curious. I have never, not felt welcome when I came and I don't want that to happen now. I am booked for November and March-April. I can and may cancel if things get worse. But if most ppl have your attitude, I will go somewhere else. I really wish Mx was demanding testing. Maybe by then they will."
"Good! I am happy you are here because I am sure you had to have a face mask on your face at some point while getting down here, so I rather say you are happy to be here and obey the rules. You had to have a face mask on the plane, at the airport, while in transport to your resort and this will be the same if you want to go anywhere here in Cancun and on your way back home. Anyway mission done, you had a mask on your face that is all I wanted for you. I will be looking for you and if I see you without a mask you know what awaits you."

"Paul S, I don't know Mikey or agree with his comment. I was asking an honest question. I'm not talking about breaking the law or not wearing a mask. We rent a condo and are a bit out of the bar hopping, nightlife age. We do go to the beach, usually walk for a couple hours every night and eat most meals at home. Unless we grab some street food. I came back and asked,because I looked into other places we used to go on Trip Advisor and it just seems less hostile. I'm not saying you, but for some reason, the Cancun area forum is alot of arguing and negatively. My concern with coming to Mexico this year, if the locals weren't comfortable with it. We use the public beach, so if the locals can't go, I'm sure we couldn't either. I have a few friends there, I keep in touch with, so I'll be asking them their opinion too. If everyone thinks the US is the hotspot for the virus, I guess we wouldn't be as welcomed as someone else. That's why I wish we had to be tested."
"Thanx for taking the time to respond. I find it quite disturbing, anyone not in their own country would purposely break the law.(or in their own country, for that matter) Thanx again, stay safe!"
"""the locals are getting more and more pissed of at any tourist who comes and is having fun on the beach while all others (locals) are being banned from the beaches and sent back home because beaches are closed and we are on orange light""Paul S, Very true. I see it everyday here. Unfortunately, I think we may be coming to a point where the tourists see it too. There's only so long these resort employees can go doing their work and watching what is basically a double standard without some resentment creeping into their attitude. I fear for their jobs because if a tourist complains an employee was rude there's a long list of people waiting for that job. ""We use the public beach, so if the locals can't go, I'm sure we couldn't either""""But for some reason, the Cancun area forum is alot of arguing and negatively.""Clmeade, Yes. It's true you will not be able to use the public access points to the beaches.  And, sadly, it's true that lately there's been a lot of arguing and negativity here. ""Click here at the link to see the screenshot what he just sent to me in a private message. https://imgbox.com/Az0JmJCB""Paul S, I did click on it and I'm calling bullsh*t on it. I'd bet anything that never happened. Something that people who don't live here might not be aware of but one group that has been hit hard by Covid deaths are the police officers. They are one of the professions here with the highest rate of Covid deaths. This isn't a money making scheme to them. They're one of the most exposed groups because they have to deal with people who simply refuse to follow the law because they don't agree with it. It's viewed by the officers as an attempt to keep even more of their own ranks from contracting the disease. Of course, there's always those not or two rotten apples but the chances of Mikey running into one while he's not wearing a mask are about as good as me winning the gold medal in figure skating in the next Olympics.IJust follow the law, folks. You wouldn't think of coming down here and renting a car and driving that car after 10 tequila shots would you? It really is the same thing. It's the law. If you can't abide by it then perhaps this isn't the vacation spot for you."
Looks as if the delete police were out big time. Perhaps that will encourage people to just wear masks and not complain about it.
"We were at the Valentin July 18-25th and I have to say that at least the resorts are taking this much more serious than most places in the US. All staff including the guy driving the tractor on the beach was required to wear a mask. Anyone with direct contact with the guests was required to have a face shield and a mask. The resort however did not require guest to wear masks. My husband and I kept our distance from people and enjoyed our time there. There are already rules in most places that say that as a woman my breasts must be covered in public unless breastfeeding. Literally no one has died from seeing a woman's breast and yet there isn't a huge national outcry about this rule infringing on women's rights. If me wearing a mask has even the possibility of keeping someone from getting COVID19 then it's worth wearing it. I can't pretend to understand why the Mexican government has kept the beaches closed to the public but not the tourists. One day near 5 pm a family with two little boys showed up on the beach. We were one of only two couples left on the beach at that time. Normally I would not be happy about a family with kids crashing my adults only getaway, however, I knew that the public beaches were closed and this family just wanted to enjoy a little beach time just like us. They played in the water for close to an hour then gathered their stuff and left."
They were lucky. Some resorts are calling the Police on locals who attempt to use the beach. All beaches are public so technically ALL beaches are closed......including the parts in front of resorts They're allowing an exception for tourists. Locals run the risk of having the police called to tell them to leave by the resorts if they manage to get to a part of the beach in front of a resort. Public access points are closed off and locals can't enter through resorts short of buying a day pass. I'm glad that family got to enjoy the beach for a bit but most of the families I know wouldn't run the risk of having the police called on their family.
They were at the far north end of the resort's beach area and next to that is a couple of condos that didn't seem occupied and one condo building that was in the process of being built. Maybe it was on of the construction worker's family. Like I said there were a total of two couples still on the beach at that point. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it and the other couple seemed like minded.
"Christal, Personally, I think the majority of tourists would have your great attitude towards it under the circumstances. Resort management for the most part doesn't seem to share your generous spirit. But I do understand they're concerned about looking like they're exceeding the 30% capacity. And I'm sure they don't like calling the police on locals just trying to sneak in a few hours at the beach. But sadly, they are doing that. It's just a very unfortunate situation."
Christal D - A tip of the hat to you for letting the family have a few minutes. Few things are more important than families and as they were hurting no one it was nice of you to 'turn your head'.
"Most of the resorts closer to Playa are only getting around 15% occupancy from what I have read so a few might be close to 30% but most are no where close to that number or even the 25% or so Cancun resorts are getting. When I go later this month I would also not have a issue with locals using the beach in front of the resort given the circumstances as well.Edited: 5:14 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"I always marvel at the Mexican culture as it applies to social etiquette. Things that we look past in the US are viewed much differently in Mexico. I think in the US that as business owners we don't want to put our employees into situations that might be confrontational with our customers, but in Mexico it is much different. I remember being searched once returning to the Presidente because I had bags and the bell boys wanted to make sure that we didn't have drinks or snacks. Seemed odd because that would never happen in the US, but that is the way of life in Mexico. I assume that condo security as well as mask police are doing what they do because someone told them and no doubt that someone would want to lose a job now or ever in Mexico."
"Calmjohn,,, if you see a Mexican family with 2 children enjoying THEIR ocean and beach,,,,mind your own businesses....they dont need to ask american tourists to 'turn your head'......"
"Baba, Not sure if you are just taking a swipe at John or missing his message. While there is no question that the beaches belong to Mexico, the family unfortunately would be breaking current ordinances. While I am sure (or hope) that no tourist would be so spiteful to report the family, but there is a chance that they could unknowingly rat the family out by saying something to someone that might feel it is their responsibility to enforce the laws."
"sunngod...its none of your business what a mexican family does,,,,,if other mexicans wish to report them that is fine,,,,,americans can leave if they are worried about the Mexican families going to THEIR beach....Edited: 9:57 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Babaloo, I think you're creating an argument where there isn't one. No one suggested that it was tourists who would call the police on a Mexican family who was enjoying the beach. Sadly, it's the employees at the resort who are reporting the family to their bosses. And it's those bosses who may or may not call the police. I use the word sadly because I refuse to believe the reporting is done by the employees out of malice. But they're between a rock and a hard place. They need their job. And like it or not not, right now if a local family goes to the beach they are in violation of a city ordinance. All that being said, every nationality has some mean spirited people. Yes, a Mexican family doesn't NEED a tourists permission to use the beach. And I'm sure that 99% of the tourists wouldn't think twice about seeing a family on the beach sneaking in a few minutes of enjoyment. But there's always that 1% of the people who for whatever reason (including just because they're mean) would report them to management. I may be wrong, but I think Calmjohn was just commenting that it was nice the poster who talked about the family was in that 99%. And I think sunngod was just echoing that. Really, I think we're all in agreement here...."
"here are the 2 posts made by american tourists,,,telling us how good they are for letting a Mexican family use THEIR beach,,,,,,..how lucky the mexican family is for have such considerate americans and allowing their mexican children to play in the water for ""close to an hour""Christal D ..""Normally I would not be happy about a family with kids crashing my adults only getaway, however, I knew that the public beaches were closed and this family just wanted to enjoy a little beach time just like us.

"Again, Babaloo, I think you're misinterpreting the intent of the posts. I don't think Christal was saying she'd normally not be happy if a Mexican family came to the beach. I believe she was saying she'd be normally upset if ANY family came to the beach at an ADULTS ONLY resort. Her issue didn't seem to nationality. It seemed to be that it was a family. And I believe calmjohn was just basically saying ""good for you"" for not being one of those mean spirited people who might report the family. I truly think you're reading something into the posts that just isn't there."
Relax Baba. You are getting worked up over nothing.
"Christal D ....They were at the far north end of the resort's beach area and next to that is a couple of condos that didn't seem occupied..a total of two couples still on the beach...so the beach was emptyJoan S...beach is public,,,,,,there are no adult only beaches....the mexican family have every right to be there,,,they do not need an american tourists permission.....if americans do not like seeing mexican children playing in the ocean for ""close to an hour"",,,then they should go back to their adult only resort,,,,"
"Baba has a point. Not every tourist will think and behave like those who turned their heads the other way. I don´t want to add fuel in to fire but the problem is created by the hotels and resorts in the first place. As someone said they will do anything to get money and not looe the job. That goes to reporting the locals. The order here is that beaches are closed! And that means for everybody. In Playa Del Carmen I have seen police officers kicking out even tourist from beaches that were from a hotel and a resort because the locals got very angry about it. We can´t discriminate the mexicans. So if it were me, then I would take very radical steps here and either open the damn beaches for everybody or keep it closed for everybody. No freaking joke in between. And there is nothing like a public becah and a private beach here in Mexico. All the beaches are public from the water a few meters wide where anybody can walk, sit, swim and have a good time and can´t be kicked out by any hotel staff because is public and belongs to mexico and their citizens. So not to let some tourists think the beach belongs to them and nobody can be there. The hotel property ends like 8 meters from the water or so (not sure the exact width) but there were a lot of conflicts in the past becuase of this. So unless the hotels and resorts don´t want to have an uprising or even a riot from the locals there I would be very careful in reporting the locals and abusing it too much because one day the patience will be over and a mass of locals will flood the beach and occupy the hotel and not leave. Tourists would be sent runing home and back to Cancun airport! I would be the first one to lead them and participate on such protests. This will not hold on for too long. I am sure the orange light will be put to yellow even though the numbers with infection will be the same like now with an orange light. This creates hostilities. I am a local here too and it pisses me off to see gringos having fun and I have to stay at home and not even get to a beach for now the fifth month! The beach is public, the access to the beach can´t be blocked for one group and open from the hotels to another group. Is illegal and there are many lawyers who are working on this day and night to end this as soon as possible. Even AMLO the president has put clear orders and investigation in place. Tensions are rising and I warn any american or other tourist to dare report a local being on the beach. Attacks on tourists are rare but would be the biggest nightmare for Cancun and the day will come when some will say I had enough and do something about it. It won´t be nice and peaceful..Edited: 12:47 pm, August 05, 2020 "

"Babaloo I am with you here. I had already argues here with some who dared to come here and refuse to do social distancing, refuse to wear a face mask, refuse to hold on to sanitary protocols, totally break the laws and be joking how they will buy their way out of a fine or problem. They think they come down here and do whatever they want even breaking the laws because Mexico will tolerate that thinking Mexico needs their money so they can push the limits. For all those I have a message for you, no they don´t need you and your money here. The tourists who said they turned their head when the local family was on the beach was a good thing, but as I say not many will think and act this way. And even a resort or a hotel can get easily closed and very fast if tourists think they can come down here and not obey the laws. Here is a link to what happened... https:/…2020.html"
"""This will not hold on for too long.

It would sad to find out that the majority of tourists were so self centered and entitled to think and act otherwise."
"Wow Babaloo you took that sideways really quickly. It wasn't at all about it being a Mexican family or them being on ""my beach"". That was your assumption. We were staying at an adults only resort that we have been to before and it does not have any major resorts next to it. Even before COVID19 the beach normally has very little non-resort foot traffic other than a hand full of beach vendors and we have never seen kids on that section of beach during our previous trips. I do understand that the beach is not private and that anyone can use the beach. In normal times most resorts don't care who's on the beach as long as non-resort guests stay off of the resort loungers. I'm not sure why you took a sweet moment like a young family playing at the beach and twisted into something ugly. I knew that as locals they were not supposed to be on the beach at all regardless of the location of the beach. I don't understand or agree with the double standard that the Mexican government has in place. I was just happy that the family got to enjoy the beach for a while without any problems."
"Christal D.. ""I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it"",,,WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,,?....did their children spend too long playing in the ocean..?Edited: 1:57 pm, August 05, 2020 "
Babaloo I didn't want them to get in trouble that was all I meant. While I can control what I say and do I do not have control over what other people say and do. I had read prior to our trip that some resorts were reporting locals for being on the beach. As I have stated I don't agree with the double standard that is currently happening. I was happy they got to spend time on the beach and I didn't want their time to be marred by them getting in any trouble. I'm sorry you found everything about my post so offensive. You must be fun at parties.
"Christal D,,,,,they are a mexican family on a mexican beach,,,the beach was empty,.they were in front of some empty condos at far end of beach,,,,,,there was only one other couple on the beach,,,,they let their children play in the ocean for nearly an hour,,,,,you are an american tourist,,,,IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,,,,,,,i guess they should be very thankful you didnt make a""big deal about it""......thank you"
Joan do you know how the situation is with the beach outside of the hotel zone in and around Punta Sam? I haven´t been there for two years now after bad experience with crime. I think it is easier for the locals to go to the beach there but I wonder how well do they keep the beaches cosed over there? Thanks.
"As I read thru this thread, I am very saddened. IMHO if a country is choosing to allow tourists (especially US tourists) into their country, the beaches should not be ""closed"". In reality...the beaches are only closed to locals who don't want to pay a day pass to use the beach at a hotel. The beaches are only realistically open for tourists paying to be at a beach resort. That is wrong in my opinion.Either open beaches to everyone (I realize at this juncture since they have been closed for so long that that would be a logistical nightmare), or close the country to tourists. It's not at all fair to make ""local rules"" and different ""tourist rules.""I don't have an answer to that previous choice, but I do realize that this will never end well when a government puts the need for $$$ over the sanity and welfare of their own people."
"Paul, In the beginning (even when we were classified red) some locals would go to Isla Blanca and the Punta Sam area for the very reason you suggested. Those areas weren't monitored very well. That has changed now and as a result the only people out that way are the tourists staying in the resorts and people that live there. We were asked by friends a few weeks ago to head out there with them but declined. Honestly, our declining had less to do with knowing the beach was closed as it it did with the fact that crime at those isolated beaches is still very prevalent. Our friends did go. It I should say attempted to go. Before they could enter the beach they were greeted by the police who told them to turn around and go home. Not liking that answer, they left to another part of the beach were the same thing happened. And guess what? They didn't like that answer either so they went on search of another beach area. And what did they find? Yup, the exact same thing. They wasted an entire day looking for a place to sneak in the beach only to finally have to admit there just wasn't one."
"At the end of the day, us Americans should respect the laws of another country. Its disappointing that this thread has gone on for so long over something very simple. I personally think that masks should be required inside the resorts as well. I find it to be selfish behavior when I see tourists around employees that are required to wear a mask without a mask and not practicing social distancing. There is a certain level of entitlement that comes with thinking its ok to disrespect the laws and expectations of another country or business."
"I agree with you about indoor masks at resorts where social distancing is not possible, to protect resort staff and fellow guests. Unfortunately, there are those who can’t be bothered with that small inconvenience on their “hard-earned vacation” so hotels won’t risk making it a requirement. I see so many reassured by the staff all being masked...as if staff are the only concern instead of their looking in the mirror. There’s a lot to unpack in that worldview, which I won’t do as not to stir up more controversy."
"In what situation is a mask required. If I am walking on the sidewalk? At an adventure park? I don't have to where one at my resort but I have no problem putting one on to walk through a restaurant at another resort. What If I am walking down a empty beach along the water to get to another hotel. I just want to know so I don't get it trouble. And please don't tell my to just wear one everywhere or I will get arrested because that's what you think people should do. I want to know the real rules to know when they are required and not required. Does anyone know the real rules.Edited: 4:32 pm, August 16, 2020 "
">> ""In what situation is a mask required.""In all public spaces in the municipalities of Benito Juarez and Tulum.>> ""If I am walking on the sidewalk?""I'd call that a public space, so mask-up.>> ""At an adventure park?""Also a public space, but if outside the municipalities where mask wearing is a law, it might not be enforced.>> ""What If I am walking down a empty beach along the water to get to another hotel.""That's also public space.Will you get arrested for not wearing a mask? Probably not, but IF you are warned, and still refuse to wear a mask, then you're in trouble. Masking is not well-enforced at Playa del Carmen, and from what I hear, Tulum.Edited: 4:45 pm, August 16, 2020 "
That is alot different from what my hotel is telling me. They say you don't need to where a mask on the beach because its a private beach.. And you really only need to wear one indoors when your not at the hotel. I have people on this forum telling me that I have to wear one basically at all times. I'm just going to see how it goes when I get down there and try not to worry about it because I don't know what to believe.
"The hotel is wrong -- all beaches are public -- but you probably won't be hassled to wear a mask on the beach.Edited: 5:36 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"But here in Cancun you might be warned by the police that the beaches are closed if you walk away from your resort any distance. You can use the beach at your resort. In front of your resort. That doesn't include 20-30 minute walk down the beach. It's just as it say....AT your resort. If you are outside on a public street you must have a mask. Shopping centers, stores, markets, grocery stores, in a taxi or bus.....all require a mask. Basicalky, if you're outside your resort in Canc u you are required to wear a mask. And it is being enforced in Cancun. In the first week the Covid Police were active they have out in excess of 600 citations requiring the payment of a fine for not wearing masks. Yesterday they were checking people on the buses in the hotel zone to make sure everyone was complying. And Mr. B is right. Your resort is wrong. All beaches in Mexico are public. The city of Cancun is allowing resort guests to use the beach. It's not the hotel that's ultimately making the call. Many resorts like to think they own the beach (resorts attempting to privatize the beach in front of their resort is a huge issue here) but they don't. It's all public."
"Please, understand.The rules of the country are there.Nobody cares about your opinion of their laws and regulations.Obey or don't go."
"do wear mask, covid is worsening in area .. by 300%From local news:https://www.poresto.net/quintana-roo/2020/8/…Google translate: ""Cases of COVID-19 soar in Quintana Roo with economic reopeningMexico is positioned as the third country with the most COVID-19 infections worldwide and Quintana Roo registers an increase in positive cases of 296.78 percent since the economic reopening took place,"""
Again with the fake news Mexico is not 3rd in infections they are only 9th in the world in active cases and 7th in total cases. Quintana Roo also saw its lowest increase in new cases in over 3 months the other day at 29 new cases for the whole state.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"DreamDays Is not really interested in accuracy, it’s more about the drama. She is convinced that if she just posts every day with a news story or a new piece of information no one will ever travel to Mexico again. I don’t think it’s working, But it gives her a hobby"
"Of course is fun to travel, I my self traveled half of the world, but in pandemic times? Is safer to stay home, less chances to get sick or spread, what is wrong with you Carol, really, keep getting on me for trying get the message to people to be more more careful for their own good, in few month vaccine is out, why cant wait till then? So Mexicans can get vaccine and not getting sick and dying"
"Carol A, you hit that nail right on the head. I extended my stay after my first flight was canceled. I am sick and tired of people feeling the need to ""White Knight"" and show how they are better than everyone else. I am a healthcare worker, I have zero worries about traveling, as do most of my colleagues."
"coldcalgarian, I was just as you just few month back, till covid affected me personally, is just not your time yet to understand that covid is downplayed, going to be to late for few, for 783k is too late already, in just few weeks it will be 1 millionEdited: 3:19 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Hi, Carol.As a health care worker, what are your recommendations for flying internationally? Things to do while on the plane, etc.Thank you!"
This is the internet. Just because someone says they are a healthcare worker doesn't mean they are. They might work in a hospital cafeteria. Be careful where you get advice from. I don't think it is accurate to state that most healthcare workers have zero worries about travel. That has not been my experience.
"Hi Kimberly F, Carol never said she was a healthcare worker, I did. I hope you don't mind me answering you. First of all, follow the rules of the airline you are traveling with. If they require masks throughout the flight, obey it. The airlines I am flying with have exceptions like when you are eating and drinking. You do not have to rush that. Second, if you are flying with disposable medical masks, make sure when the mask gets moist from your exhalation, change it out immediately. That is the point where masks get dangerous to your health. Cloth masks and non-medical masks are totally useless and only make others feel more comfortable around you.Third, this is how I always flew anyway, wipe down your seat, tray table, armrests and screen with an alcohol wipe. You can put them in a baggie in your purse, they will stay active and moist for up to 2 weeks if sealed.Fourth, get as much fresh air and sunlight as possible before your flight, take an immunity booster with a high dose of vitamin C, and zinc twice a day 3 days before your flight and for 3 days after you land. If zinc bothers your stomach, eat more meat or legumes, spinach is good source too.Fifth, wash your hands, use sanitizer when out in public - like a restaurant or shopping center.Sixth, relax and enjoy. Eat great food, talk to people, take time for yourself. Stress will make everything more prominent and lower your natural immune system.I say all this to make everyone more comfortable. I am a believer in herd immunity and natural immune-boosting properties. I work with very ill people who are in the high-risk category, in a designated C-Vid_ One 9 hospital. I would not give this advice lightly. I, myself am in a high-risk category, as is my father who I take care of."
"Marcus S, I am a frontline worker. I am directly involved with patient care. I don't know what your experience has been but as you are free to voice your opinion, I am as well. I understand your hesitancy to believe a stranger on the internet, I really do. This place can be toxic but I want nothing more than to help people. I have no bad intentions."
"I work in healthcare, I’m not a provider and have never said I am and I’m not going to give people advice on what they should or should not do. You need to make your own decisions and do your own research.Unlike DreamDays I don’t have a motive to either get you to travel or not get you to travel, that’s your decision and you can decide as a responsible adult based on the risk to you, the risk to those you encounter I’d recommend doing your own research and not depending on anyone here who probably has a motive either to get you to travel or to stay home for your facts to help you make your decision."

"coldcalgarian what a wise advice .... "" I am a believer in herd immunity "" ? you have to research again, update your self, Fauci now tells there is NO ""herd immunity"" antibody last from 1 week to 3 monthhttps:/…index.html Fauci said: Herd immunity could lead to enormous death tolls in the U.S.Edited: 6:18 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Faici said: """"If everyone contracted it, even with the relatively high percentage of people without symptoms ... a lot of people are going to die,"" he said.Fauci noted that with the number of people with diabetes and obesity in the U.S., ""the death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable"" if everyone got infected"" In Mexico more than in US obese and diabetics, soo scared for them, poor people ..... victims of spreaders those who refuse to put mask on"
"DreamDays, if all you follow is CNN perhaps it's you that needs to update yourself. Fauci has been flip-flopping on this issue since day one. I didn't quote anyone, I think for myself, thanks. If you believe you are the authority on anything because you watch CNN non-stop, you are deluded, which you have proven over and over again in the month I have been here. I am sorry about your friend, I am sorry you are suffering so much. I know you will not accept this but I would gladly help you find someone that can help you work through your feelings. Someone asked for an opinion of a healthcare worker and I gave mine along with personal information to cement my own experiences. You push a vaccine that can be incredibly dangerous after just a few months and think it to be the saving grace. It isn't and I say that with 100% certainty, a safe vaccine takes 5-8 years of studies - not human trials. You need to find peace and I hope you do sooner rather than later."
I think Dream Days' heart is in the right place.
"OK, in your opinion how long last antibodies?And .. will FDA approve vaccine if they are not 100% sure is safe?"
Antibodies are only one piece of the puzzle. Even after the antibodies are gone our T cells still recognize and mount an immune response to the virus if there has been a previous infection. The link that I am providing even suggests that prior infection with a different Coronavirus in the past may provide immunity from Covid-19. The link I am providing is not from CNN or FoxNews it is from Science Magazine so it should be non-partisan. https:/…
"""And .. will FDA approve vaccine if they are not 100% sure is safe?""How many drugs have been approved by the FDA that were later stopped for serious side effects.If you want to bet your life on a vaccine that may never be developed, that is your choice.People at risk need to know who they are and take the measures needed to avoid becoming infected. Not silly masks and six foot separation. Not closing economies."
"OK CO_Pilot54, so your opinion .. what we must do to avoid more people affected ? Just today MEX + USA around 3k people gone. People who were alive just week ago ... what must to be done to save their life?"
This is entertaining. We have one person who is determined to raise any alarm and one person who On one hand says FDA is full proof and should be trusted when it comes to hand sanitizers and then claims we should not trust them when it comes to vaccines. Make up your mind copilot
"many people are big to criticizes, you tell don't trust CNN, Fauci, vaccine, face mask, science, FDA etc, in while thousands die each day, so what you propose to reduce human casualties? herd immunity clearly wrong directions as way too many die in process to reach the goal, Meanwhile thousands die each day, what we must do to reduce death?"
