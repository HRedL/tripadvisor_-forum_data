"Thinking of booking Venice for a week in September, but wondering if it will have joined a no go area by then. We could isolate on return, but feel travel etc. may close down so an indication of how numbers have been changing recently would be very useful to us,"
The poster GAC has been writing up daily reports in the pinned COVID thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…
"This thread gives the numbers and is updated daily:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…In my personal opinion, this is a very bad time to plan a European vacation, or indeed to travel anywhere in the world outside of your own country of residence."
"You also can follow the numbers here:https:/…countriesClick on ""Italy"" and you'll find a lot of information about the numbers, the deaths, the trend, a.s.o."
There are much better aggregator websites than the link in Post 3. I would avoid using that particular website as a primary source of information.
"USA-Drew, please give me a better website with all that overviews and statistics which is neutral??"
"Thanks a lot for those replies. I think we may delay booking a while to see how things go, but those links are extremely helpful."
"The numbers of contagions are at present steadily low, though less low than in July. But maybe it is no use spending one month, or more, checking obsessively the COVID numbers. Think to relax and to set your mind elsewhere for a couple of weeks. At the end of August, or at the beginning of September you can decide for the best feeling what is the best thing to do for you; if you decide to go, you'll have no big issues in finding some accommodation, with all people from other continents who can't travel yet.If you want my opinion, if the situation doesn't get worse, you could try. I have already noticed that people who have not travelled yet, and spend most of their time at home, exposed to the media - always reporting about COVID and hardly anything else - have a much more anxious attitude than those who ""dare"" to travel; these ones usually are very satisfied to have travelled; I can't remember negative commentaries like ""we should not have gone, everything here is so gloomy"" or ""we were steadily in the fear of the virus"".Myself, some days ago I travelled to Portugal and it was a very beneficial experience."
"Thanks Aristofane, you talk sense as we went off to somewhere just a couple of hours away for 3 nights a week ago and it does make me feel a lot less bothered about it all."
Personally I would hold off booking until a couple of weeks before. I’ve just booked a three night trip to Venice for the end of the month. There was plenty availability and prices were good. I accept things can change in two weeks but I’m reasonably confident at the moment that things should go ahead. I wouldn’t be confident about anything further out than that at the moment.
#9I find that things concerning COVID-19 are changing just about daily!
"Post 10 - they of course are changing daily but the 7 day rolling case numbers per 100,000 which the U.K. government is using as a guide to determine which countries go onto the quarantine list gives a bit of warning and a level of predictability."
"I agree fully. In fact, in my own daily postings hyperlinked in #1 above, I am now giving the rolling 7-day average of new cases registered in Italy, which gives a better indication of the trajectory than merely one-day figures."
"Hey from over the water! HahaI booked our flights two nights ago to Venice for 1st September, so I’d say just go for it!"
"Let's note also that the absolute number of detected contagions should be rapported to the number of tested people. These days the trend is testing anyone coming at airports from important countries like Spain or Greece, what means much more tests. So:14 August: 46,723 tested people, 574 detected contagions (1.22%).15 August: 53,123 tested people, 629 detected contagions (1.18%)Of course, the media have taken advantage to scream about ""enormous rise in numbers"" and so away. But in fact the contagion ratio is absolutely low, and even lower on 15th than on 14th.Edited: 2:40 am, August 16, 2020 "
"There is apparently a spike in cases -- especially in people under 40 -- and I just saw something on Twitter that because of that spike as of Monday masks are required in all public places from 6am to 6pm-- apparently including outdoors -- and nightclubs are closed.Edited: 1:14 am, August 17, 2020 "
"https:/…Sorry, I got that wrong. New mask rule for when distancing not possible from 6 PM to 6 AM, not the reverse."
"Sorry but here we are supposed to talk about numbers. These restrictions might be imposed regardless of the real numbers of contagions, which in fact keeps staying very low; moreover, one may suspect that so more tests at the airports have been made latest days to justify a new policy of ""unavoidable"" restrictions."
"The OP is from the UK.The ECDC figures which the UK government uses to assist its decisions on travel advice and prohibition are currently showing the UK to have a higher 14-day case notification rate per 100, 000 than Italy. On that measure Italy is therefore safer than the UK.That case notification rate is also rising in the UK, but not (yet?) in Italy. However a rise is not necessarily an indication of greater infection, as it can also be an artefact of who, where and how many are tested. Better indications (though with a slightly longer lag) are the rates of admission to hospital and death rates, neither of which are (yet?) rising in the UK, and which are (so far?) continuing to fall in Italy.Edited: 5:13 am, August 17, 2020 "
"ReiseBeate:>>please give me a better website with all that overviews and statistics which is neutral??<<Sorry - I typed up a response earlier this week but when I clicked submit, I received an error message - I think TA was updating the website at the time. When this message was bumped the other day, it reminded me that I needed to re-type a message to you. I think we already discussed this topic in a prior thread anyway, but maybe I was not specific enough. As I mentioned earlier, I would recommend using an aggregator website that was created by a university group. There are several options to choose from - and you can select either US based or non-US based universities. The problem with Worldometers is that Worldometers doesn't care about being accurate - they only want a new daily number and want the total number to be higher than the previous. There are many errors that have been pointed out and communicated to Worldometers about their reported numbers and they never fix the errors - they simply don't care. They just want clicks on their website. You might ask which university website to choose? Well - it will depend on how you want to view the data because each website presents the data in a different manner. For example, the Harvard based website that I linked below presents the data on a 7 day rolling average in a per 100,000 people format. They also show the total number of cases and deaths but focus the presentation on the last 7 day rolling average. Click the button to toggle the data from US to World view. https:/…Edited: 11:47 am, August 19, 2020 "
"Let's not forget the ratio with the number of people tested.Today 19th August, 642 detected cases, for 71,095 tested people (0.90%). Compared to the data of 14 and 15 August I cited before - when the ratio was already very low - the ratio is even lower.If the trend is testing more and more people, it's logical that the detected cases are likely to grow a little. Of course, our beloved media have once more taken advantage to talk about ""enormous rise in cases"" and to spread terror."
"It is also important to look at the trend in daily hospitalizations. From the absolute lowest number of TOTAL hospitalizations (705) on August 1, daily new admissions have been slowly increasing through August 15, then increasing somewhat more rapidly in the past four days. Total hospitalizations today are 866, which is 22.8% higher than on August 1 (but still only 2.99% of the highest total hospitalization count of 29010 on April 4).So, quite apart from the statistics on new daily reported cases (which vary considerably according to the number of swabs taken), the hospitalization numbers have been trending up for the past 19 days, although not alarmingly so.ICU numbers have also been trending up from July 29, when they reached a low of 38. Today they are 66, up 73.7 from July 29 (but still only 1.62% of the highest ICU count of 4068 on April 3). Given the uptick in hospitalizations, it is useful to also keep a close eye on the ICU numbers going forward.Statistics can certainly be very misleading, as Aristofane correctly notes above, and the Media indeed has a recognized proclivity to sometimes exaggerate them, or at least not to consistently put them into context. Nevertheless, the COVID situation in Italy today is worse than three weeks ago, due largely to the much increased movement of people, the relaxation of many restrictions, and the return from domestic and international vacation destinations. There have also been numerous reported examples of people assembling without taking the necessary precautions (e.g. nightclubs and discos (now closed), beach activities, happy hours, parties, etc.). This of course is NOT limited to Italy (indeed, it may be worse elsewhere).The recent COVID numbers in certain other major European countries are much worse than those of Italy."
"# 19, USA-Drew: We here in Germany have the Robert-Koch-Institut, which is an international higly accepted research institute. They give their numbers to Worldometer, so Worldometer and RKI (Robert-Koch-Institut) are releasing the same numbers. And as the numbers of RKI are the right numbers, also the numbers of Worldometer have to be right.And as I see the numbers given of GAC above: the death-cases are the same as Worldometer today writes.Edited: 4:24 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Thank you for these interesting considerations, GAC. Anyway, I would have some doubts about the certain cause/effect ratio of""due largely to the much increased movement of people, the relaxation of many restrictions, and the return from domestic and international vacation destinations""It is quite possible, and, no use reminding it, it is the theory supported by the media: let's blame all of it on people, they were not docile enough to the orders given for their good. But it is debatable, and, I think, it should be definitely debated more than it is in fact. Other hypothesis might be that data go on fluctuating randomly on low values for months, maybe years, and anyway a vaccine might be never discovered (or made available in great numbers). So, what to do? People should also have granted a lot of other rights, to work, to socialize, to flirt, to kiss, why not to travel.Edited: 4:40 pm, August 19, 2020 "
