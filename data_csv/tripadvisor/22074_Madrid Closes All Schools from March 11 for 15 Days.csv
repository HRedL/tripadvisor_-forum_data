"The Spanish Health Minister is closing all schools in Madrid for 15 days because of the coronavirus, which has affected Madrid more than any other area of Spain. This will affect more than 1.5 million students and 135,000 professors. The schools affected include universities."
"The reason for this is that in the last 24 hours, the number of cases of the coronavirus in Madrid has risen from 202 to 577 and the deaths have risen from 8 to 16."

The average temperature is 2-11C during December.On March 11, TV news interviewed Isabel Sola, who is the Codirector of the Centro Nacional de Biotechnologia de Madrid (CNB-CSIC). She is an expert on the disease. She said that with the warming of the temperature in spring and the advent of more sun, the virus will be less deadly because the virus prefers cold weather."

"Tips from the Stanford Hospital (Palo Alto, California, USA)The Stanford Hospital is one of the leading hospitals in the US. They have these tips about the coronavirus:1. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. Please send and share this with family and friends. 2. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 110. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water! THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days. 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention."
The Regional Government of Madrid has just ruled that all restaurant terraces have to be closed.
#11 Benny you may mean well but posting cut and paste pieces without checking their accuracy (see the comments on your post on the Malaga forum) is unhelpful and potentially dangerous.
This cut and paste Stanford Hospital advice is fake.
