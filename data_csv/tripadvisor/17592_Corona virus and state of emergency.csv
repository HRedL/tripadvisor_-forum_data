"I have a trip booked for spring break . We are coming specifically for the zoo , sea world, a stop in HB and a drive to LA for universal . Should I cancel amid the corona virus epidemic ?"
"Up to you.It isnt something that has changed either my or my wifes travel plans (she travels weekly), or anything that I do from day to day, although her company did just cancel a trip to Mexico that a large # of employees were going to.Edited: 7:09 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"No, I would not cancel unless you have underlying health issues and are prone to sickness."
"Your risk is more about being in an airplane for 5 hours than it is being in SD. The decision is yours. If f you’re traveling with small children or you have immune issues that should impact your decision. I’m not flying until this over. But my choice isn’t yours. But a lot of large companies Facebook, Google, Amazon) are severely limiting their employees travel."
We are healthy but are traveling with kids . We don’t have any underlying health issues . My dr didn’t think this was worse than flu deaths . I am just concerned since we are traveling to places with crowds So I’m on the fence .
>>My dr didn’t think this was worse than flu deaths <<I believe that there have been around 80 influenza deaths in SD County this season and 0 Coronavirus deaths. If Im not mistaken there has been 1 Coronovirus death in CA a state with 40 million residents and it was an elderly person with underlying health conditions.
The “state of emergency” is a legal declaration to obtain government funding. It doesn’t mean there’s an actual emergency.
You live in NYC where you are in crowds all the time. If you do your normal travel there then coming here should be easy for you.
"Individual choice. Children seem to be the least affected, and there is at least some theories that suggest they may be carriers but not actually sickened.The profile of fatalities, including in China where data is slowly trickling out, is heavy among aged and infirmed although sadly among the Chinese dead are some medical professionals.Do get a flu shot. Even though that is not directed against Covid19, flu is still something to be avoided."
"Well...you know there are three cases in NYC now, right? I'm guessing that pretty soon, the risk level will be the same no matter where you are."
"Actually it is doubtful that the risk level will be the same no matter where you are.Even in China, there are hot spots, especially in Hubei, and in Daegu in Korea. Don’t know Italy well enough to comment.And frankly, there really are no hot spots in the U.S., regardless of the deaths. For now."

We wanted to fly to San Diego in April. Is it safe? Trump says it safe to fly but I don’t believe a word that idiot says!
"No one can guarantee your safety anywhere you go in the world at any time! With that said, you have more to fear on the plane itself than here in San Diego.Up to you the risk you are willing to take.It depends on your own health."
>>We wanted to fly to San Diego in April. Is it safe<<<Why did you just ask the same question that the op asked? You will get the same answers that have already been given.
"A lot more people have the flu. If that would stop you from traveling due to underlying health issues in your family, then treat it the same way."

Keep checking. https:/…cases-in-us.html
"Many people get such minor symptoms that they don't seek medical attention. I don't believe the CDC, WHO or anyone else knows how many cases there are (or have been) in the US. So while the fatality rate looks high, the overall number of people who have (or had) the virus is completely unknown, but certainly larger than what's reported."
"We are heading down to SD in April and will fly from San Jose. We will be taking the precautions recommended by the CDC. Unless we are sick ourselves or our family is that we are visiting, we will be going.Edited: 7:59 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"We are splitting time between our San Diego and San Francisco homes. We are seniors in our 70s. We continue to go out, go to lectures, zoos, museums, gatherings. To not be engaged in socio-economic activity is also harmful to our communities.But we are also conscious of risks.....we lived in Guangzhou in a SARS and H1N1 setting, we were in Japan for the earthquake/nuclear meltdown, we have been through natural disasters....So precautions and health consciousness are necessary. We are not without chronic ailments that can be extremely negatively affected by viral infections, but our medical professionals have also been good in providing counsel.CDC remains a great source, and enough reputable expertise is out there too. And there are, of course, your own medical professionals."
>>>We wanted to fly to San Diego in April. Is it safe?<<<No.Maybe not safe to leave your home.
"Well I leave my home daily and I’m a public servant so I have a great risk here too . The schools , banks , post offices and courts are still opened . What scares me is the confined space on the plane and the recycled air ."
"We canceled our trip to California. We were supposed to fly from Toronto to LA today for babymoon :(, super upset. But we were stressed as I am pregnant and if I get sick, there is barely any medication I can take as being pregnant. I think if you are healthy you should have no issues."
I think being pregnant you made a wise choice. Why risk it since we don’t really know what the outcome could be? Listen to your obgyn and your gut. I’m sure you can find something nice to do in driving distance to your home. Congratulations !
Sorry to hear that Kim . Better be safe than sorry .

Disregard that last very inaccurate post.
"What a difference 10 days make. I just reread my post #2.Now, all work travel for both my wife and I has been cancelled, we cancelled travel to the NCAA Tourney that isnt being played and opening weekend at Wrigley. I cancelled Marriott reservations that I had for the next few weeks in SF, Sacramento, Spokane, and Chicago. And multple flights on Alaska, United and SWA.I did go to the bar last night (The Local) and it was busy like a normal Friday night there and as I posted in another thread Little Italy seems like business as usual.Im also now working from home as are all of my colleagues."
Went to our branch library today. Not a few parents beefing up childrens books because of the school closures....we are Poway.....and the libraries closed starting Monday until April 6.

Some restaurants closing in SD.https://sandiego.eater.com/2020/3/15/2118049…
"Governor Newsom’s directive on bars and night clubs will hit the micro- breweries hard because many are indeed micro. Restaurants already seem to have sparse clientele anyway,"
The Scripps testing cabana: https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/pu…
"I hope that by now you have read the news and know that most if not all of the stops you've planned to make are now closed until further notice. And it will be raining here every few days in the coming weeks. ALL restaurants, bars, theaters, and gyms were ordered to close 3/17 at midnight."
"I’m not glad to hear any of this . I know the parks are closed until the end of the month . Even though we aren’t due to travel until mid April , I don’t see it happening. I think things will be shut down beyond what they have said"
I see New York is not without problems. Stay safely socially distanced.
