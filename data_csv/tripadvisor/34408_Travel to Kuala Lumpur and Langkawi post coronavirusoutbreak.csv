"Hi guys I would be travelling to Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur on 10th March for 5 days from India(Kolkata).Is it safe to visit ?I am really tensed about this visit and not sure about what decision I should take ?Are Indians or tourists from other countries visiting Malaysia post the outbreak ?What precautions should I take ,?All my hotels ,sight seeing via klook and flight tickets are non refundable hence I am saddened and tensed about the entire situation right now .Kindly assist"
Just heard about a news where a person tested positive in Kedah Langkawi .What precautions to take ?Is it safe to travel ?
HiNone of us can tell you what to do and if you are so worried then it is best to cancel your trip.
"HiKedah is the whole district which covers an area on the mainland and also includes LangkawiEdited: 4:44 am, February 15, 2020 "
Hundreds of thousands of people are continuing to travel to all parts of the world. I probably would not be traveling to China but I can’t see a reason not to travel to Malaysia. There is no large scale issue there. But if you are going to be stressed going then it is probably wise to cancel as the trip will not be enjoyable for you. CheersSean
The person mentioned in post #2 was not in Langkawi but at the border station arriving from Thailand.
Thanks Sean .A current state video or in depth review from someone who visited recently would have been really helpful.
India should have travel warnings for their citizens as most Countries do. Maybe check this and see if it eases your concerns. CheersSean
That looks a bit vague.No advisory as such but I would like to have an in depth analysis of current situation in Malaysia and necessary dos and don'ts required for a smooth visit.May be someone or some group who recently visited Malaysia can let me know the current status .
"I would suggest you post your question to India's CDC or other legitimate health authority rather than posting here on a travel forum. Here in Taiwan where I live we have 18 cases of the coronavirus--the same figure as Malaysia--but people are going about their daily lives, just with a greater sense of caution and preparedness. I'm sure people in Malaysia--and India--and the rest of SE Asia are doing the same. Personally, I wish I was getting on a plane to KL tomorrow..."
"Actually I find the post quite amusing.Malaysia is a country of a population of 30M people. We have so far identified a small handful of infected persons and quarantined them.True there may be carriers with no symptoms among us.So I translate your fears on myself.I currenrly live and work in KL. With the same fear should I stay at home?Since your bookings are non refundable, my suggestions are as follows:1.come2. Take precaution by wearing masks at unavoidable public places like airport and airplanes3. Modify your itinerary to go to less crowded places - langkawi should be easy4. There are lots of places in KL where crowds are less serious. Go thereMyself, i avoid crowded restaurants, play golf instead of going to the gym, have coffee at cafes rather than crowd at busy restaurants etcEdited: 6:54 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Maic’s advice is great. I would only add that it is important to ensure that your hands are clean, especially before eating and touching your face.Other than all that, there is no way that it would be appropriate for any of us to advise whether to cancel or proceed with your trip. I realise that you are not necessarily comfortable about making this decision, but this really is a time when that is exactly what you will have to do."
Thanks Maic that was helpful !!
"Hi pratikrock7,We Malaysians go by like any other regular days: go to work, eat out during lunch break, head home (and sometimes catch up with friends over roti and teh tarik) - all this while continuing to be mindful and maintaining hygiene on frequent basis.Our government - like any other foreign government continues to maintain active preventive measures to ensure everyone's safety.And with all the valuable feedback from fellow TAs with some residing in Malaysia, that should be able to draw up a definitive answer for you.I can understand your concerns but if you still think otherwise, it might be best for you to visit Malaysia next time around.Be well :)"
Please don't say like that .I surely want to go and visit Malaysia .Planning it since a year almost .
"Not in Langkawi but have been in KL for 10 days now. I can't think of any rational reason not to come. In my opinion one can and must distinguish between actions at a public health policy level and at the moment the actual threat to any one specific individual. With 21 identified cases in Malaysia as of today and tens of millions of people, well you can do the math.Edited: 9:58 am, February 15, 2020 "
"I have recently come back from a 2 week holiday with my family in Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia. We planned our holiday as normal. We went swimming in the pool, I went gym several times, travelled by taxis, hired a moped, went up Penang Hill, eat in restaurants and street food outlets. We took the advice of all health officials who said masks are not really necessary but wash hands frequently. We have to go about our lives as long as your being cautious. Had a lovely time in Malaysia. Great people and great country. Our hotels were doing frequent temperature checks and also asking people if they have come from China in the last 14 days. Don't fear. Go and enjoy yourself as planned."
Fantastic post full of common sense Naeem. Glad you had a wonderful time. CheersSean
"Hi pratikrock.So, just continue with your plans then. I don’t know exactly as that is not possible for anybody, but suggest that the possibility of catching some sort of temporary debilitating illness would be as likely in your country as well as many others."
Thanks Lenny Bruce
"So after all your panicing, what have you decided to do or are you still agonising over it? Just interested."
"Hi - My Wife are doing the same trip but for two weeks. We are on our third night in KL at the moment, life goes on as normal. Just be careful."
"I've researched the coronavirus for at least 2 hrs a day for the last three weeks because of my upcoming trip to Malaysia on March 4. I think the odds of a trip interruption or quarantine are much greater than the odds of getting the virus. Do you have travel insurance? I just cancelled my trip to KL (including Borneo and Sri Lanka) because yesterday my flight was changed dramatically by Cathay Pacific to result in a 7.5 hour layover in the Hong Kong airport before departing for KL. I was not concerned about getting the virus in Malaysia but I was concerned about hanging out in the Hong Kong airport and a bit concerned about flying in the airplane (there are asymptomatic virus carriers traveling). Cathay Pacific is giving me a full refund and I can go next year, so I have nothing to lose financially, making it an easy decision for me to postpone my trip. I agree with all of the prior posts that the odds of getting infected are really small. My bigger concern would be trip interruption. Here's a great example of how easy the virus can unknowingly spread and lead to travel delays/quarantines: https:/…index.html""Of the 143 passengers who traveled to Malaysia on the infected woman's flight, six were held for further testing. The rest were allowed to continue their journeys.The locations of about 500 other passengers are currently unknown, with many believed to have already left Southeast Asia.""Edited: 1:05 pm, February 18, 2020 "
Hi Renee (#25).I think that your post is one of the very few sensible ones that i’ve seen since all this began. Of course what you’ve reported on the forum is spot on.
"Agree TK, that was a good post from Reneet as we need a bit of sanity. Personally I think the economic damage world wide is a far bigger issue as when superpowers like China sneeze, pardon the pun, the rest of the smaller economies catch a cold. I know personally of tradesman not able to work in Australia as materials are held up on the docks in China. CheersSean"
@travelkat88@seanjotadhgThank you for the kind words!Good luck everyone with your travel plans!
Hii even I have everything for booked for Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur for 19 the March and dont know what to do as my flight tickets are again nonnamendable.
"Hi globetrottermumbai and welcome to Trip AdvisorI guess you are aware that there are some cases of the virus in India also, so from that point of view it doesn’t make any difference where you are. You could still catch it. However, what does matter is the possibility of air transport disruption and various countries closing their borders. They are issues which nobody can predict or advise about. Perhaps you could wait a while before deciding what to do as your departure date is still a month away."
Hi globetrotterYou have lots of time yet and the situation could change for the better (or worse!) before then. Just keep your eye on the news and monitor the advice your own government will be giving about travel at this time.We cannot tell you what to do. Ultimately it has to be your decision.
"As of 19 February 2020, Malaysia has had 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of these 22, 15 patients have had full recovery and discharged. The remaining 7 cases are in quarantine and being monitored. There have been no deaths to date.There is no panic buying of toilet paper or groceries. Not many people wearing face masks in the streets, maybe 5-10% of the population. More people were wearing face masks during the haze last year. People are going to work, shopping mall and restaurants as normal.At the end of day, its up to you to make the decision whether to come. No one can make it for you."
"Just to add to what Jadamros has said above.My friends in Langkawi are all going about their life as normal, kids going to school, shopping etc, etc and they are being pretty laid back about everything and I doubt that any are wearing masks although perhaps the hoteliers, who are meeting and greeting tourists from many different countries, might be wearing them.The island seems to be fairly quiet but there is still a good amount of tourists on the beaches and in restaurants and they do not seem particularly worried either.Just keep monitoring the situation."
"As an aside the Star has a report on the Genting Dream ( cruise out of Singapore) docking in KL today after screening of passengers. It mentions 957 passengers.The listed passenger capacity of the ship is 3,348."
"It's interesting what can change in only three days. See the link in my post #25 regarding a Westerdam cruise passenger found to have been infected with the virus (after flying to KL from Cambodia) and the delays/quarantines that affected many travelers as a result of that single diagnosis. Now fast forward only three days and information is emerging that she may not have been infected with the coronavirus. Considering the patient is 83 years old and is still sick (from something), I doubt she was miraculously cured of Covid-19 in a few days. But who knows? Since I posted the first article about this case, I felt compelled to post this follow-up article. https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asi…"
Keep in view of this post from our authorities.https://www.tourism.gov.my/news/trade/view/m…https://vm2020.malaysia.travel/alertTravel safe :)
"Further confirmation (this from the USA Center for Disease Control - CDC) confirming the passenger on the Westerdam cruise ship previously testing positive (in Singapore) was never infected with the coronavirus. This case shows how far reaching the effects of an incorrect diagnosis (or a false-positive) can extend to the misdiagnosed traveler and any others associated with that traveler, including those on the same flight. https:/…"
"Good for you pratikrock. I feel sure that once you start your break and get into holiday mode, you’ll forget all about this issue and will just enjoy yourself."
Pratikrock7 are you still traveling on 14th when the number is gone to 83 in Malaysia
"Re #38, the woman was diagnosed in Malaysia not Singapore. The article linked stated that “The CDC retracted an earlier statement to USA TODAY stating that the woman in question never had coronavirus. On Monday the CDC said they ""have no visibility on whether the initial test of the woman was anything other than positive."""
"We are travelling direct Brisbane to KL for a couple of days from Easter Sunday. Then a week in Langkawi. Our return Malaysia Air flight was cancelled so we took the opportunity to book a couple of extra nights down at Batu Ferringhi after 3 days at The Blue Mansion in Georgetown.We are simply watching Australian Govt travel warnings and ignoring the crazies on social media.I'm in my 60's and so far I reckon I've survived 5 of these 'end of the world ' scenariosEdited: 11:39 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Keep in mind this new notice from Malaysia dated March 4 regarding Sarawak. Things could change and affect other areas of Malaysia in the near future. My travel plans would have been affected by this notice so I'm thankful I received a full refund from Cathay Pacific for my March 4 flight to KL: ""On Wednesday, March 4, authorities announced that Sarawak state would prohibit entry to all non-residents who had spent time in or transferred through mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea, Iran, or Italy up to 14 days before their arrival in Sarawak. These measures have been implimented in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).Malaysian non-residents of Sarawak are strongly advised not to visit the state if they have spent time in or transferred through the aforementioned countries and territories in the 14 days before their arrival in Sarawak. Sarawak residents who have visited the these countries and territories in the last 14 days will undergo mandatory home quarantine for 14 days.""https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/3…"
"Re: #41, thanks for the clarification! I actually meant to say KL, not Singapore, and it appears she likely was a positive! Oops.Edited: 1:50 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Hey pratikrock7,Did you go to Malaysia. If yes, Can you share your experience ?"
"I am in Malaysia, what do you want to know...?"
"Those articles that tell the majority not to be concerned because of their younger age, don't seem to care about those that don't fit into the ""safer"" age groups. Sad."
Travelling from the UK on Friday hoping the Malaysian government dont enforce restrictions like Vietnam!
"Same, Paul. I don't travel till next week but hanging on edge here, waiting and seeing how things progress."
"Hopeful we will be able to travel at this point, as although the situation is serious the media definatley does sensational things,When you step back from the media everyone here in the UK is carrying on as usual really other than the panic buying of toilet roll !Reading the posts on this forum it would appear many other places are the same"
Hi yes I agree but there are no restrictions for other countries with far more cases than the UK ie France Germany and the US so fingers crossed Cheers
be safe. the current situation is a bit fluid. if can avoid will be better.
What is it like on the streets in Kuala Lumpur? Calmness?
less people walking about in hotspots such as Bukit Bintang and Changkat. Bit calmer than usual but still life goes on
Thanks!

"As much as I hate to say this, in a pandemic situation, the socially responsible thing to do is to avoid non-essential travel overseas to minimise the spread of the virus from one country to another. The risk of getting infected unknowingly and passing it on to other more vulnerable people around you (your family members, co-workers, neighbours, the elderly, those with compromised immunity or pre-existing medical conditions) is high now. Viruses cannot spread without people moving around and coming into contact with other people. Short-term pain is better than long-term pain. If people cannot comply, we won’t see an end to this pandemic and the resulting recession any time soon.Edited: 12:22 am, March 16, 2020 "
Hey guys I will be arriving 1st time ever in Malaysia in next few days and not worried about COVID at all. Question: Easiest way to arrive my hotel just flag down a cab from airport to my final hotel destination @ Jalan Bukit Bintang? About how much will it cost? Maybe 120 - 140 Ringgit?
"You can't technically just flag down a cab at the airport.If KLIA you can either buy a airport limo coupon just after customs, or use the grab app to hail a grab car. Else take the KLIA express train into KL Sentral and get a cab or grab from there.If KLIA2 you either get a coupon taxi, grab or KLIA express train."
I saw that online today as well - here is the article I saw:https:/…
No partik did not go. Also I cancelled my trip
