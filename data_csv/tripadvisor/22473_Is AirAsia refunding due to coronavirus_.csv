"Hi, anyone has any experience of getting a refund from AirAsia Thailand in the wake of coronavirus situation? Singapore based airlines are offering full refunds but there is no such thing yet from AirAsia. Just wondering if anyone has some firsthand experience? Thanks."
My guess would be that they would charge extra.
Have you tried to contact the airline directly?
"Thanks for your reply. Their tickets are usually non refundable so they would simply not refund, deduct 100%. I am wondering if they are offering anything back in case a tourist decides not to travel in the wake of the virus situation."
"Hey FCB1, unfortunately they dont have a call center number...they do have a virtual rep who would not respond to specific questions like this. They are offering refunds to travellers with tickets to China but nothing for tourists from anywhere else, according to their website."
"Why would they refund non-refundable tickets? High expectations there! In my understanding, there is no travel warning out for Thailand, so why would anyone issue refunds for a simple change of mind?"
"Thanks Oldnhappy, your comment makes sense. There is no travel warning yet for Singapore as well, yet for some reason they are facilitating their customers."
">> Singapore based airlines are offering full refunds=====================There's a big difference though, it's because these Singapore based airlines are experiencing reduced demand and are cancelling or consolidating flights. Therefore, if you are on one of their cancelled flights you can get a refund, move the dates of your travel or fly on an alternative flight. If you aren't on one of those cancelled flights, you aren't allowed to refund etc, you are still tied to your ticket terms and conditions."
"rameenhashmi,I just looked up Air Asia (Malaysia based) website regarding refunds requested by travellers.Here is a direct text:""Only applies to the areas below;India Domestic (I5)Indonesia Domestic (QZ)Flights from/to the United States Flights departing /arriving/ transferring at South Korea.""Edited: 12:26 am, February 20, 2020 "
"You can't normally get a refund for a flight, simply because you have changed your mind and don't want to go anymoreMillions of people are still travelling and having no issues at all, I just returned a week ago from a 7 week trip to SE Asia"
Oldnhappy even though there is no travel warning out for Thailand some airlines are offering refund. I cancelled my trip to thailand in the first week of february. The Airline tickets were non refundable by the time I booked it.But due to corona virus they gave full refund to everyone who cancelled it. rameenhashmi Its better you contact the airline. if you are in australia you can contact airasia australiacall centre. AirAsia Australia contact number: +61 2 8188 2133. I found this number on google. Dont know whether its working or not.
Many thanks Ree...great help mate...this is what my original question was...any practical experience of refunding. Cheers mate.
Glad to help you rameenhashmi. Please note that My ticket was not from Airasia. It is from another local airline.So I dont know whether Air Asia will give refund. BUt All I know is some airlines are offering non refundable tickets refund due to corona virus Outbreak.
"My LCC has been very honorable with their cancellation policy.I use HK Express between Phuket & HK. They have temporarily cancelled their daily morning flight, leaving only the red-eye special.My options are:1.Full refund.2.Re-booking at no rebooking fee within 6 months.3.If the re-booked flight is more expensive; any additional costs are waived."
I canceled my trip in March to Thailand as well. And I have AirAsia tickets from Phuket to Bangkok. I’ve been trying to cancel as well. My flights from the US to Thailand back to the US were all canceled. But my one flight to take a day trip from Phuket to Bangkok is nonrefundable to Air Asia. Bummer
"Hey Tanya, Airasia is practically impossible to even contact. I guess they dont need to consider refunds given the fact that they will end up with profit no matter if we travel or not. Our tickets were from Bkk to Brisbane. Will not buy tkts from cheaper airlines in future, lesson learnt."
"good post Ree, doesn't affect me either way but an actual answer to the OP's post instead of useless one's questioning the OPit's post like these that make me keep coming back to TA even if i have to deal with scrolling over nonsense postsCheers!"
Their fares are non-refundable. I doubt even travel advisories would be an exception.
rameenhashmi Absolutely lesson learned. My US flights didn’t want to deal with rerouting my layover was in Hong Kong. They happily refunded me.
"no way is airasia refunding anything try to get refund from Honolulu to Bangkok via osaka japan. they offed to change dates for 150% of ticket cost, ticket cost 215 us dollars change fee was 369 dollars. what a complete joke"
"Why should AirAsia refund anything? Has there been general travel advisory issued by relevant authorities not to travel to Thailand or Japan ? There are meanwhile 9 countries with more Coronavirus cases than Thailand. Tomorrow France will probably the 10th country to overtake Thailand.Should Lufthansa, Air France, Asiana, United Airlines, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, ANA all refund all the money they received from bookings?"
Just a heads up ...AirAsia is Malaysian.
If you want to cancel then perhaps next time retain the flexibility of a ticket than can be. If your government have issues a travel warning against all travel then your travel insurance would pay upIf AirAsia cancel the flights then I am sure they would refund or allow a change
"Yes travel insurance may pay but often there are excesses, internal flights in Thailand won't be that much anyway, often around 800 baht."
Hmm..travel insurance!
"I had a non refundable ticket with China Southern and they cancelled and received a full refund a few weeks ago. The agent I booked through said it could take 30/45 days to receive the refund. It was actually in my bank within 24 hours.Even a non refundable ticket can be reimbursed if the airline cancels, if your country advises not to fly you should be able to claim through insurance.I’m meant to be flying out on Wednesday with Gulf air who say at the moment they’re still flying in and out of Bangkok, so fingers crossed it’s still flying on Wednesday."
The very reason why I never take Air Asia even when they offer zero air fare. At least Malaysia Airlines offer refund or change travelling date. But Air Asia?? NIL
"It's not refunding in Malaysia or Thailand. Certainly UK travel insurance wouldn't pay out either as no government travel warning in place, they haven't even put one on South Korea other than 2 places so people can't get refunds there either from insurance."
"They may pay out if your flight to Thailand is cancelled.Some years ago I had this issue, my flight from London to Bangkok was cancelled due to a strike, my other flights to Laos were covered.Edited: 1:53 pm, March 01, 2020 "
got a full refund when they cancelled my flight from bangkok to honolulu via osaka
of course you are likely to get a refund when the airline cancel the flight but the question is about the customer trying to cancel a non refundable ticket which is completely different
"Hi rameenhashmi, There is no refund for Domestic Airasia Flight in Thailand. Even I have booked a flight which they have refused to cancel. Since I booked it from Goibibo, I requested Goibibo team to reach out to Airasia. And Yes, Airasia refuse to the Charges. Even the Hotels with non refundable booking have simply refused to provide any refund (not even partial)."
"Mr_Dhawan, why would you expect any refunds, especially from non-refundable bookings? Read it ... NON-REFUNDABLE. You are a bit special if you think that means ""refundable if you get the jitters and want to cancel and get all your money back"". Even more so if you booked through a third party agency. Kiss it goodbye or go to Thailand and enjoy a lovely holiday. Your choiceEdited: 6:26 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Lesson learnt, maybe."
"Of all the closed coronavirus threads, this one lives on?"
Depends on the tix but usually not refundable especially the promo seats. Hopefully though that they make some consideration.
AirAsia cancelled my flight from Singapore to Krabi on 14 April and have refunded me in full already.
"If the airline cancels the flight, then no problem getting a refundThe problem is that some people are expecting refunds, just because they have changed their minds about travelling."
Thats the difference between Air Asia cancelling and the passenger cancelling.Of course Air Asia will refund if they cancel their flight.
"But how about if Thailand has imposed a quarantine? As I booked it travelling from HK, with a 14 day quarantine I don't see many people wanting to travel. I guess time will tell if AA will cancel the flight altogether"
"AA would have to cancel its flights between Thailand and HK, if Thailand would imposed a quarantine on all passengers coming from HK. They would then obviously have to reimburse all passengers. However, the Thai government has confirmed today again that no mandatory quarantine will be imposed on travelers coming from any country (unless you are sick obviously) ."
"For those who were genuinely interested...and also for those who got irritated on my question....i had a couple of non refundable bookings in hand on Scoot, the Singapore based airline. Had a chat with them, they have offered either a 50 percent refund or a 100 percent credit voucher with 1 year validity. That despite non refundable tickets. I guess people who understand corporate and social responsibilities will understand this as well, others will find it weird..refund on a non refundable ticket. Cheers folks !"
"AA apparently is going to give it rest, to China for the rest of the month. Really no point in flying empty planes.""Thai Air Asia has announced that they will stop flying to and from Kunming, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau from 11-31 March 2020 due to the #coronavirus epidemic. Passengers can:✅ Change flights without charge✅ Transform it to credit✅ Request a full refund """
"Since there is no travel warning covering Thailand, odds are AA will not cancel. If they do, the refund will be in the mail. Your decision is your prerogative. Granting a refund, of a non-refundable ticket, on a currently scheduled flight, is theirs.Now you're just pouting ...Edited: 8:43 pm, March 10, 2020 "
They are actually refunding for some special destination. Check the link https:/… chat with AVA
Update: Airasia eventually cancelled its flights between Bangkok and Brisbane. Full refunds are now available.
"Yep, as above poster has stated, flights between Brisbane and Bangkok (and return) have been suspended for the time been.They are offering a choice of:1:Reroute via Gold coast-Klia2-Dmk2: Move flight (the suspension starts on the 5th April, so can move your flights to before then)3: Credit into Big Account4:Refund.My flights for mid April are a part of these suspensions, so I'm looking further into the opinions to see which one is better for me (might be flying either Thai airways or maybe going with Singapore Airways with a stop in Changi)"
thats the problem you cant contact air asia direct unless you want to call India or the UK there is no australian number to ask the question nor is there an email that doesnt bounce back - ive never come across such bad customer service - please if anyone can inform me how to contact them instead of trying to go through the virtual robot as I need to know how to either obtain a refund or try to move the flight date until nxt year
what about Brisbane to Bangkok
Flying AirAsia currently through Thailand and Vietnam and back to Aus. They are not refunding only re-scheduling. If your flight gets re scheduled they give you option to change day/time aswell.
"Apparently if you are a no show, you are able to get the tax back - just google it. Saw on OzbargainIf I do not wish to fly after purchasing a flight or if I could not show up for flight, what can I refund?AnswerThe booking of a seat is confirmed after full payment of the fare is made and after we issue you a booking number and/or the Itinerary.However, you can get a refund on Airport Tax. In the situation where you did not board the flight, you may request for a refund on the Airport Tax paid, within six (6) months after the scheduled date of flight departure. You have the option of an AirAsia Credit Account or back to the original mode of payment.Should you prefer the AirAsia Credit Account, the full amount of the airport taxes paid will be refunded. On the contrary, refund back to the Original Payment Mode is subject to a refund fee (per guest per sector) as stated in our Fees and Charges. Other services purchased together with the flight would not be refunded.https:/…"
"Nope. Dont even expect. :( I already asked them via twitter message, and no matter are the cases, they wont give any refund. Unexception Covid-19. Btw I bought connecting ticket from Palembang-KL then KL-Bangkok. Like almost 2 months ago"
"Air Asia has refunded our Brisbane to Bangkok and return flights booked for June and October. We will now use the money to rebook with a different carrier, providing we are able to travel. Good luck."
That number doesn’t work anymore :(
"I anyway traveled on 11th march (as cancelation was never provided as an option) on air Asia flight as scheduled from Surat thani to bangkok. And to share my experience, we were treated pathetically. First we were forced to web check in, which didnt left us an option to sit together. If you want to sit together, you have to pay extra. This was my last booking with air Asia and I won't travel with them again. In fact, I will think twice before traveling to Thailand. People are racist there and I had to face it not once or twice, but 4 times. It happened almost everytime when we checked in at a hotel or obtaining a boarding pass for an airline. They would keep best seats or rooms for white people. I didn't expected it to happen but people lie on your face."
#54How if you have to check in on line do they know you are not white and to give you the worst seatIt is no secret that on Air Asia you pay a cheap fare and then get ripped off for everything else
"They have self assit station for web check-in on airport which had a long queue and everyone was forced to check in from there. When you are traveling with infant, you have a separate queue when you are traveling with an infant, you have a separate queue for check in or the baggage counter just do it for you, which wad missing. Additionaly there was no gratitude in their behavior. Forget gratitude, not even a smile on their faces. The note with regards to racism was on my flight back to home when I was said no for a front row seat(saying it was already booked) while same was allocated to a white guy simultaneously on the adjecent counter (web check in was showing that seat empty, but I couldn't do it as it had to be done at lease 4 hours prior). I really wanted to confront them right then and there but with baby sleeping on my shoulder, I didn't. I also strongly felt it while checking in at IBIS Krabi and Milky Bay Resort in Koh phangan."
"How did you apply for a refund, MelbourneCountrygirl?"
Unfortunately there is still no refund on domestic travel in Thailand. My personal advise would be to avoid unnecessary travel. Else you may have to face quarantine upon your return.
"Ahh so post #56, what your really saying is that you were to cheap to book a desirable seat, and because they wouldn't give it to you for free, they must have been racist to not pander to your needs.Nice try at pulling the racist card (I give it a 5/10 score, you would have scored higher if you said the cliche lines ""my human rights"" ""I had a baby so no one else matters"" or the best ""I clicked my fingers and no one came running, they must hate Indians and they are all racist"")."
"""How did you apply for a refund, MelbourneCountrygirl?""When I applied for my refund due to having the same flights cancelled (Brisbane to Bangkok), I used the link in the cancellation email they sent me, and went thru the automated AVA site. Really was quite simple and only took a few minutes.Just have your booking reference number, full name, date of birth and email you booked with ready.I only cancelled about 5 days ago so haven't got my refund yet (they said it can take up to 30 days), but will update once I receive it."
