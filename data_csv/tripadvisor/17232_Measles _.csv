"Hi folks, Another forum member intending to visit Paris,alerted me to the recent increase in measles cases in some European countries including France. BBC news report is on this link - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13024173 Perhaps local experts like kerouac2 could comment on the ground reality and assuage doubts of people intending to travel to France next month. arvind"
"Measles aren't a huge issue if you are vaccinated, as most westerners are, so I am not sure? if this is something you need to worry about. .. have you been vaccinated"
"Hi joan1, Yes,it is the same here in India,people are vaccinated. It is just that travellers should be aware of the quantum of dosage and take corrective steps.( I have been vaccinated but,regretfully,I have no plans to visit Paris at present. ) Wish I were and dreaming . arvindEdited: 9 years ago "
"Edit: Sorry, Arvind, I was writing my post while you posted the above. I thought that you were planning to come to Paris next month.Arvind,I have quite a few Indian friends who have not been vaccinated against measles, so I understand your concerns. Giving you a definitive answer about the risks of you or one of your family members getting measles while you're in Paris isn't possible. If statisitcs help to ease your concerns, last year 27 million tourists came to Paris. According to the linked BBC article, there were 1,000 cases of measles in all of France (not just in Paris) in January 2011. I think that the chances of you contracting measles while you're in Paris are fairly slim. I haven't heard anything on the French news about the measle outbreak. I also checked the US State Dept. travel warnings and the official government site for Paris to see if I could find anything. It didn't turn up on either of those sites. In any case, I would recommend that you carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you when you're in Paris. I usually apply some after getting off the metro and before eating.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Hi, Thanks all.it was my concern on the measles. I am happy to see the advise and any way shall consult my family doctor.Neelu60"
"Hi sojoh, Thanks for that informative post. If precautionary steps as mentioned in the BBC post are taken,travelers should have a wonderful trip. How I wish your presumption were true and I could come to Paris again. arvind"
"hand sanitizers are worthless against measles -- it is an airborne and highly contagious condition being spread about the world by people who don't take the responsibility to vaccinate their childrenunfortunately if you have not had measles but are an adult vaccinated as a child yourself you are likely to be somewhat vulnerable -- vaccinations don't innoculate as well as having had the disease and many adults have reduced resistance to measles (and pertusis) if you are concerned you might want to re-vaccinate -- if you were never vaccinated then you shouldn't be traveling about the world without measles, pertusis and hepA vaccinations at least -- the first two incredibly risky and easy to contract through the air"
"Not a big deal. It's true that a lot of these diseases are reappearing because people have forgotten about them -- they were ""almost"" wiped out so people now forget to have their children vaccinated as they should."
epidemics didn't happen because a handful of children were not vaccinated due to allergies or whatever -- they happen because large numbers of parents are free riders or nut cases --- it takes a significant group of vulnerable people to make an epidemica dud vaccine will do it if lots of kids are unprotected -- or a group who decides that their child should face no vaccine risk and so they will rely on everyone else vaccinating their kids to protect the unvaccinated through herd immunity
"Many parents in the UK were not happy about the triple vaccine, as gardengirlie says, considering this too much for a baby to cope with, but chose to pay for three single vaccines instead.Unfortunately some parents still choose not to have their children vaccinated, despite the very unpleasant or permanent side effects of some diseases. Then doctors surgeries are inundated with phone calls of panicking parents when a possible outbreak is mentioned on the news.It is the same when travelling to any other countries with recommended vaccinations - some people pay a lot of money to have all the recommended ones, and others will only have the compulsory ones if a certificate has to be shown at immigration.Outbreaks of illnesses / diseases are always possible on any holiday, so always have any recommended vaccinations or tablets before you travel.Better safe than sorry.Hand gels are only helpful towards preventing contact viruses, not airborne ones. Wearing mouth/ nose paper masks doesn't help either, as they are ineffective as soon as they get damp."
"Interesting topic. Where I live, one cannot register one's child for school until proof of vaccinations are presented. I wonder if this is not true in other parts of the world."
There are no notices currently being distributed in Paris-area schools of any level regarding measles.
"The Minister of Health posted the following information on the Paris.fr website today. paris.fr/accueil/â€¦rub_1_actu_99444_port_24329The translation is thanks to Google:Measles, wrongly considered as an ordinary childhood disease, is currently undergoing resurgence in France. The number of cases is increasing since 2008, it is exponential: 5000 cases in 2010, already more than 3500 cases since the beginning of 2011. Paris was hit by the epidemic, 240 cases of measles were reported in 3 months. One method of prevention: vaccination. It is a highly contagious disease potentially serious or even fatal. It usually causes high fever, rash, cough, tiredness (severe) and sometimes pulmonary and neurological complications that may require hospital treatment. Several deaths have occurred since the beginning of the epidemic one of them since 2011, including frequent hospitalizations among children less than one year and young adults. The only way to be effectively protected against measles is vaccination, two doses of vaccine are needed. The vaccine against measles is safe, well tolerated in most cases, and is reimbursed by health insurance. If you are not sure to be protected against measles, tell your doctor or check with vaccination centers in the city of Paris"
"Measles were mentioned on the news today, and there is indeed an epidemic. For the first time in decades, there have even been some deaths."
"Arvind,The concern was mentioned in an article on cnn.com. I don't know if you are travelling with an infant, but the increased risk was to babies up to 11 months who are not yet old enough to receive their scheduled MMR vaccine which is around age 15 months. So doctors are saying that if you must travel to the countries affected by the outbreak with a baby within that age group, that he/she gets a travel dose of the MMR vaccine.If others have been vaccinated there is no risk of them contracting measles."
"Sorry for the late post. Thank you,everyone, for your informative inputs. arvind"
"We're travelling to Paris in a couple of weeks with our 6 month old. I asked our doctor about getting him vaccinated for measles when he was getting his other 6 month vaccinations, but they won't give him anything until he is 12 months unfortunately."
"I view vaccinations and travel insurance as the two most important things when travelling. You don't have insurance for when things are going well, but for when things don't go well. We have house and contents, car, health and other insurances when we are at home - why not when travelling? Keep all vaccinations up to date. After all, you don't know where the person next to you has been"
