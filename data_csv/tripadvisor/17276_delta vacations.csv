Okay.....???
Well that explains it then!Thanks for the heads up.
why?explanation as to why?bella..
I just returned Tuesday from Vegas on a Delta package (a couple hundred $$$ cheaper than booking separately) without any issues (previous Vegas trip was also a Delta package).Curious to know what his/her issues are?
Not enough people to fill tour. Tour cancelled after I am in Nigiril Jamaica.Hotel says one penalty Cocolapalm. Feel cheated. Stay away from DeltaVacation.
We use Delta vacations all the time. Everything has always gone perfectly. Sorry you had a negative experience but that doesn't mean no one should ever try them.
"Found out about ""Apple vacation"" = more for less. Will try them next."
"Here is one more against Delta Vacations--through Travelocity, I researched a trip to Cozumel, Mx flying Delta and staying at my favorite hotel. Then I went through Delta Vacations to book the same trip and found it over $200 higher. Their agent suggested reserving the flight for 24 hours and appealing for a price match through their ""price guarantee"" program. I did, with supporting info showing it was the same trip in all respects. It was rejected with no explanation other than that the trips must be exactly the same.I conclude this ""price gurarantee"" program is a fraud. I will probably fly American and book through them.Edited: 8 years ago "
Yet another old thread being replied to by a first time poster. There has been an epidemic of this happening over the past few days. What's with this?
"""What's with this?""Nothing to be alarmed about. Usually people doing a google search for something. Like ""Delta Vacation Reviews"". If you put that into Google you get 3-4 links to various Tripadvisor pages. So they come here, they read, they want to respond. They're not really paying attention to the date of the first post in thread. And they really don't need I guess. TA does close threads once they hit 6 months without new posts I think."
And I just booked my flight last week with Delta. Did I make a mistake? Should I cancel? I am so nervous now. Maybe I just won't go. Will they get mad if I cancel my trip? How much should I tip if they don't get mad at me?
"Normally I like to book seperately so I can make changes if needed. Last year, the rates were so high that I decided to look at a few travel sites and ended up using Delta Vacations for the first time.I had a great deal for the Wynn including round trip airfare and resort credits. I was afraid that I would get stuck on a lower floor and hear all of the night club noise. When I checked in, I mentioned this and got a fantastic room on the 44th floor with a partial strip view. Would not hesitate to use them again."
"Irish,I just mentioned it because there has been a rash of these 1st time posters replying to old threads lately. I also was under the impression that the threads were closed to posting when they hit 6 months without a reply. However, earlier this week there were 6-7 that were over a year since the last post that were bumped up."
"Regarding my new posting on an old thread--Read Destination Expert's post. That is exactly what I did. I was so irritated at Delta Vacations' run-around that I googled around looking for the most wide-read place to vent. My encounter with Delta Vacations went on after I made the original post and got worse. Ultimately, I went with Travelocity and got an additional 10% discount. Total savings for a two week trip was about $400 compared to Delta Vacations. Thing is, I had used them before with no problem and got a cheaper trip than I could have arranged a la carte. Where I ran into a problem was when I tried to use what they were advertising to make themselves look competitive with other services.P.S. I complained the customer ""service"" at Delta Airlines and got brushed off with a form response saying to contact Delta Vacations.Edited: 8 years ago "
"NOTE: My post is not about LasVegas but about booking via Delta Vacations.The advertised price for our cruise, $159pp, was nowhere near what we ended up paying: $580 total. We feel like we got robbed by middlemen and will NEVER book through anyone but the cruise line directly ever again. Recently, the airlines were forced to show fares which included all fees, so the consumer would enjoy ""what you see is what you get"" pricing. The cruise lines will be next, if I have my way with this!To be fair, the Delta rep was very nice to deal with over the phone. No complaints about our experience with her. We booked our cruise at the last minute, so our options were limited and we did not have time to shop around... something we now regret, having been socked with so many fees!One more thing: The initial cruise offer came via Jet Blue Cruises in an email. We did not realize that Jet Blue does not book anything but flights; instead, they have a relationship with Delta Vacations which ended up being the actual booking agent for our cruise. That meant that we got stuck paying TWO middlemen, as I am sure that both Jet Blue and Delta got a piece of the action.""Live and learn"" as they say.Oh, by the way, we sat at a dinner table with two other couples who booked last minute and paid much less than we did. Both had the same inside cabins we had, very near us and each other...and both spent hundreds less!On to the Federal Trade Commission and my Senators and Congressman to get this kind of ripoff redressed. All we want is transparency and fair treatment."
"""The advertised price for our cruise, $159pp, was nowhere near what we ended up paying: $580 total. ""A $159 cruise? Do cruises typically get offered for prices that low? What was it, and overnight on the Staten Island Ferry?"
"Ha ha! Yes, we went with our ""ferry godmother"" :)No, it was a 4 night Bahamas cruise on Royal Caribbean. Last minute deal, so price was reduced to fill the final few cabins. Small, inside rooms, no window. Not what we usually book, but for the price, we said, let's go for it. No regrets on the cruise itself, especially for what we paid, even though we were unhappy with the additional fees... still a deal, to be fair.If you watch the websites of the cruise lines and you have some flexibility as to when you can go, the deals are out there. Best deals of all happen between Thanksgiving and Christmas, particularly the first week of December, when fewer folks are traveling.Our cruise only had 2 stops: one at Nassau and the other at RCI's private island. That was your basic beach and BBQ day, fun in the sun, what you sign up for on such a cruise. Enjoyed our day in Nassau, took a van tour around town and saw a lot, got some great shots from an old fort, etc."
"Delta vacations has zero customer service, I judge a company by what they do when there is a problem, not what they do when everything goes smoothly, had 2 issues with them out of 2 trips and both went poorly. First the show tickets they gave us with our rooms in Vegas were not available for when we were staying even though the shows were half empty but not available for the promotion, why did you tell us we would get them 2 free show tickets if we booked with you? ""no answer"". They only told me tough nothing we can do, second time the flight I booked with them was with Delta and was booked as a discount ticket ""like priceline"" so no changes, no flying early in the day, no standby, very disappointing experience."
Thanks for bumping up a thread almost THREE YEARS OLD to tell us. lol.
