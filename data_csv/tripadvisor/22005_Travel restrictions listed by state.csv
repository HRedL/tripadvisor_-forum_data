"The website linked below keeps an updated list of states with quarantine advisories.  I hadn't previously noticed Kansas had restrictions, and yesterday NY, NJ and CT added advisories for travel from Delaware, Kansas and Oklahoma as well as the previous and still active advisories for other states. Scroll down for a handy map.It also has a section on ""Most recent actions.""https://ballotpedia.org/Travel_restrictions_issued_by_states_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020Edited: 2:06 pm, July 08, 2020 "
I clicked on Iowa. It is outdated on the self-quarantine after travel.
"I didn't find a restriction for Iowa on their own website, just an urging to self-quarantine. How that differs from other states with a ""direction"" to quarantine without enforcement, I don't know. I agree it isn't perfect, and the list is more up to date than the map, but I haven't been able to find anything with more comprehensive country-wide data.If you think it isn't helpful I could pull the post."
"I don't know about the accuracy of the other states, I only checked Iowa. The state of Iowa doesn't have any requirements for those traveling to the state, nor to the citizens that travel out of state. Things change so often, it would be very hard to keep up! A town north of where I live put in a mask ordinance, but that is not a travel restriction as such."
"What I've been thinking about is how many people have no idea there are restrictions because they aren't widely reported.Anyone planning to travel really needs to check the state websites for their state and any state they plan to visit.As for mask requirements - we've been wearing them on the rare occasions we've had to go to places where other people may be nearby.  Even now with mask mandates in a lot of places, people aren't doing it."

"""What I've been thinking about is how many people have no idea there are restrictions because they aren't widely reported""I have to respectfully disagree as the media is still obsessed with COVID. Our state quarantine is still daily news.People really need to be their own advocates and make their own informed decisions. I personally have no interest in getting on a plane or eating in an indoor restaurant and will likely only choose lodging where I have a private entrance and can open the windows. But I would not tell a poster they shouldn't fly, dine out indoors or stay in a hotel with common entrances. I would hope everyone's priority is to stay safe and healthy.Edited: 4:22 pm, July 08, 2020 "
This dashboard has information by county that is updated often. https:/…
"Restrictions are definitely widely reported, it's just a matter of whether you chose to follow them. I don't really know what ""making their own informed decisions"" means. My ""informed decision"" is to stay home and not travel all over the US this summer as if there is no pandemic. The cases have more than doubled since the ""peak"" in April. Something is not working. The EU and the US were at exactly the same case level in April. We are now at 60K daily and they are below 3K. We never bent the curve downward. Leadership has made the ""informed decision"" that life should go on as normal, and COVID will disappear. Explain that to my best friend's 25 year old son who died in Colorado last week from COVID."
"The Washington Post also lists state restrictions, I can't speak to the accuracy: https:/… I think this is not behind a paywall."
"Eric -Flying vs not flying is an example of an ""informed"" decision. You having been citing the air quality and cleanliness of airplanes and stating that it's fine to fly - an ""informed decision"". I have not been swayed by what I have read and thus have no interest in flying - also an ""informed"" decision albeit a different one. Hope that example answers your question."
"rjr0810...Understood. I personally would not fly now, and the two times I flew were in March and April on empty planes. I cancelled all my plans for this summer, but still think a 5 hour flight in an uncrowded plane would be safer than piling a family in a car or RV and taking a week to get out to Yellowstone and back. Just consider all the personal interactions that would take place....restrooms, food, lodging, and every other conceivable thing."
"Eric, SO sorry to hear about your friend's young son. This disease is so unpredictable as to who it takes.I personally know 3 people who contracted COVID-19: 2 died (one quite elderly & one was battling cancer). The 3rd was a marathon runner in her 30s who was very sick for weeks. As for restrictions, as others have noted, many are NOT state wide. I live outside Pittsburgh, PA & case numbers are on the rise. County where Pittsburgh lies has just closed down all indoors dining and bars. The neighboring county that I live in does not have that restriction... yet. Things are so fluid right now - can change within 24 hours."
"So sorry for your friends loss, I can only watch so much news. Had the 25 year old been sick? I know that people my age have dies from Covid 19:but I had thought it was mostly people tha5nhad some type of pre-exsisting health issue. We have decided to,go,on a road trip in an RV to see so,e of the beautiful national parks out west, Go willing we will be safe, no plans to be in the general public much."
"Thank you bluehighways and mary-ellen....My friend's son was a marathon runner and in perfect health. He developed flu like symptoms and only lasted 3 weeks before he succumed to COVID. He was in Colorado pursuing a graduate degree. mary-ellen.....I saw some of your trip plans on the other forums. I thought you were not going by RV?Edited: 8:21 am, July 09, 2020 "
