"Hi. It may seem like a weird question, but me and my boyfriend are supposed to travel to Portugal in next 2 weeks, but all the updates on Coronavirus have made him think twice about travelling. I am curious how other travellers feel about this and what are your thoughts. Thank you!"
My concern isn’t about getting ill with Coronavirus but as the end of the holiday approaches somebody feels ill and the hotel or cruise gets put into lockdown for a fortnight .But there is absolutely no hard evidence to say that will happen.It’s just a concern of mine Just like you are concerned and hundreds of others too but that doesn’t mean anything will happen to make you ill with Coronavirus
"I had these thoughts as well, as it happened to some of my friends while they were on holiday and all the flights to UK were cancelled because of the drones issue at the airports, you might know what I am talking about. ( I’m not good at explaining, hah).I am now thinking how much hassle this would cause, even some would happily enjoy the extra holiday.Thank you!"
If you are supposed to travel I assume you’ve already booked flights and accommodation. Are you happy to lose that money? If yes and you’re genuinely worried then don’t go. Me? I wouldn’t think twice about travelling there.
"Just go and enjoy yourself.What is there to say?In a couple of weeks time there might be more cases in the U.K. and maybe just maybe one person gets diagnosed with Coronavirus in your town - just the one.Are you going to stay home, stop shopping, don’t go to any public places As far as I know there are no reported cases in Portugal so what’s the difference between here and there?"
"Hi Jjjo, I noticed that you inadvertently posted your question in the United Kingdom Forum, so I have moved the topic on your behalf to the Portugal Forum.  Happy Travels!Trisha Tripadvisor Community Moderator"
"As you can see from the map on this site, Portugal is one of the few countries in Portugal that has no Coronavirus till now https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.html Will it remain like that? Probably not for longtime, we are receiving thousands of tourists,some switching their holidays from other destinations, so one of these days we'll have the 1st imported case."
Sincerely appreciate you taking time to reply!
IMO.. You might be more at risk in London than Portugal !
"I thought the same, somehow there’s the “fear” of airports, where there are thousands if not more who come and go from different destinations.I’m the skeptical one, but I don’t want to believe that if this is going to last for ages, are we really going to stop travelling? What about business trips?"
"Portugal has two cases at the last count of a population of 10.3 million.If and when governments announce compulsory bans on travel to or from certain countries or areas (business as well as holidays), suspend sporting events, entertainment and anything else where people gather, then we will know we are in trouble,Who remembers the effects of SARS in 2003 or Zika or Ebola more than once since?"
"We are in the midst of planning our Portugal summer vacation now and have had the same thoughts. Just remember how many folks get common infuenza strains and die from it each year... These are last year's (2019) stats from the US (CDC website) alone:32,000,000 – 45,000,000 flu illnesses 14,000,000 – 21,000,000 flu medical visits310,000 – 560,000 flu hospitalizations18,000 – 46,000 flu deathsWe will take precautions, but the most important prevention method for everyday living is hand sanitization so we will be bringing and using more hand sanitizer. Having travelled with small kids in foreign countries, it has always been a high priority anyways so no big concern. And we are also comforted by the idea that Portugal is a modern country in the EU with modern hospital facilities if ever needed."
"Our holiday is from 16/03 to 19/03, and after lots of discussions, we decided not to go. Unfortunately the accommodation is non refundable, same goes for the flights. Ryanair has not yet cancelled the flights to Faro.As a prevention of not necessarily getting the virus but getting it and passing it on to someone who might be more vulnerable to it than us, we decided not to go on this holiday. It is so much uncertainty regarding this and it is so much out of our control, my opinion is everyone should reconsider all the unnecessary travel and just take measures to stay safe. May you and all your loved ones be safe!"
I would go and enjoy the peace you could get covid 19 here .
"kazzy , your post is out of date........the OP was back in February. The World is a very different place now............for the time being anyway!"
