"Hi !We're visiting next month and would like to know if there is still chikungunya on the island. Also, I'd appreciate any reports about the dengue this season from anyone in Puerto Rico.Thank you."
"Dengue is endemic in PR. Chikunguya is probably still out there. There have not been many reports of either as we are barely getting over a drought, so few mosquitos breeding."
"Their has not been a new case of Chikungunya in PR, to my knowledge since early November 2014. It does not matter how many mosquitoes are out there if there are no new ACTIVE (first 10 days of infection) you can not get it. The mosquito must bite someone with an active infection then find you within a couple of days. You are right to worry, I got it last September and still suffer bad days with it, it is awful BUT at the moment it appears you are safe!.Edited: 4 years ago "
The CDC is a good resource for this type of thingcdc.gov/dengue/…wklyrpt_eng.pdf
Do we have less chances of getting this virus if we come to PR on December or January. Maybe there are less mosquitos?
The graph (on the bottom of the CDC page) shows that from Sept 2014 to Jul 2015 the highest rate of infection was by far Sept/Oct 2014. This is for Dengue. This would coincide with the rainy season.
"These are diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, which need water/rain to breed. So outside of rainy season chances are lower of catching any disease. For some perspective, the flu can be a more serious illness and it is more prevalent and easier to get.And yes, there have been chikunguya cases, they just don't make the news anymore.Edited: 4 years ago "
"There are new cases of both all through this year, but not very many. The dept of health publishes the infection numbers weekly. The official word is we are at a low level of alert. salud.gov.pr/Sobre-tu-Salud/…Dengue.aspx"
"What rainy Season, we are in a Drought this year. There are more Mosquitoes these day's, but nothing like last Year. Just use protection such as Off, Citronella Oil, better save then sorry.I have a Visitor right now that was bitten at least 40 times walking around in the neighborhood at 6 pm"
40 that's a lot lot. What are the chances that a single bite give cikungunya or dengle?
"Russian roulette...who knows.Do not worry about this. Again, the flu is a more serious illness. Did you get your flu shot already."
No but i will go to a c'inic next week. My theory is that in 2015 there has been about 80 case of dengue so far. I guess the population of mosquitos is greater that the population of people. That give a potential of 80 infected mosquitos out of many millions. I don't know if my evaluation is right?
"80 is a very low number. You are overthinking this. If you are hiking in the woods, do you think about the odds of getting Lyme's disease?Hey, I understand you want to be safe. I am travelling soon to SE Asia, where there is dengue, chikunguya AND malaria. Plus all sorts of GI bugs. So wear some repellent, cover exposed skin as much as you can tolerate, and enjoy your vacation. At least you can eat here as much as you want :)"
I don't woory much about Lyme because it did not make the news in tha past years. Do you think the odds for lyme in the north and dengue right know in the carribean are about the same?
Higher odds of Lyme's disease up north than dengue (at least dengue in PR right now. There is an ongoing epidemic in the Dominican Republic).
Is this epidemy can move from DR to PR and make PR come up as it was last year?
"You need mosquitos + infected people. No rain, no mosquitos, no dengue. Dengue is only transmitted by a mosquito vector. No person to person transmission."
