I recently just heard that there was a person with confirmed coronavirus and was in Jaco. Did I hear correctly? Thank you all in advance
See https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30929… particularly the Tico Times article in response #17. It appears the American tourists that brought the virus visited the Pacific coast but the story doesn't specify exactly where.
An overview over the current situation: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
Great info! Thanks for sharing this
"Kandy, TA now has the following posted - https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019 . Antarctica is the only continent without it."
"Coronavirus in Jaco? Yes. Apparently a couple has been tested and they are also testing the maid at the hotel. I was notified by the hotel where I’m staying just to be sure that I knew what was happening. I thought that was a nice gesture. I have friends coming next week we are changing nothing. Fear is an awful thing. Sure, we can curl up and have coronavirus run our lives. That’s not going to happen to me. I’ll deal with it if I get it. My friends feel the same way. Life is full of unpredictable hazards including automobiles. And we get into those every day or so. Enjoy Costa Rica and live by their very popular motto Pura Vida, meaning - life is good!"
"Agreed! Also, wash your hands well and often and don't touch your face!"
I just spoke to a local over in Jaco and they said it was at Hotel Balcon Del Mar just for information. I’ll be arriving this coming Wednesday and definitely still going on my vacation.
"I'm leaving for CR a week from today. I'll take the same precautions that are also necessary at home. I normally don't, but I'll bring my better laptop so I can work more effectively remotely, if necessary.For anyone who's job would be at risk if a vacation is unexpectedly extended, bear in mind that there are other risks to consider.We once spent an extra three days in CR because Turrialba activity closed SJO for a few hours and we couldn't get a flight home sooner."
Dear Jim A...thank you I love your attitude...We are waiting for you mimsadaisy...and hopefully hundreds of people more will come...Roadadvsiro

I have plan to travel to Costa Rica next week with my older parents. I was wondering if touristic spots are closing?

">I have plan to travel to Costa Rica next week with my older parents.<You are going to travel internationally with individuals who are categorized as ""high risk?""The US State Dept. advises to reconsider any international travel. Before you know it, they will advise against any non-essential travel - just like so many other countries around the world. I'd argue that this threshold has already been met for high risk groups..."
"We all have the right to respond in our own way but we do NOT have the right to impose our opinions and strategies on others. Given that the first case here in Costa Rica was brought to us courtesy of a pair of American tourists (who at the time would have been unaware of the danger they posed to our local population) now that we are aware of the risks, do you really think it’s fair to expose others? Hopefully, you and your friends will keep to yourselves and observe our country’s guidelines with regard to social distancing, etc, so that YOU do not infect US.Edited: 6:27 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"No worries, D E - it won't be long before travel will be restricted and/or airlines will cancel even more routes, thus slowing this ridiculous spreading of the virus for purely egotistical reasons."
"Since you will be the only one traveling, this may be a moot point. The messages from the White House this afternoon added no additional clarity nor plan. This will be dealt with but it will not be a matter of days or weeks. I am optimistic the Costa Rican national health service will be proactive and reasonably efficient.BerniPura Vida ""Hotel"""
"stay home. as an individual living in Costa Rica with a compromised immune system, I beg everyone to stay home."
"But Inca, what if I really want to drink some Patrón at the RIU swim-up bar? Shouldn't that take precedent?"
"I cannot describe to you how few ""f#cks"" I give for that type of traveler Framp :)"
"The border is closed, and will be until at least April 13th. You won’t be able to get in."
