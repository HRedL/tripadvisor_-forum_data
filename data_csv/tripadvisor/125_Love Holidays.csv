I've recently booked a holiday with Love Holidays and am due to depart in a few days however I still have not received my boarding passes for my flight and have previously emailed them to pre-book seats. Is this an issue anyone else is having as I have tried ringing them but am getting no response?!
"Hello Alice,There are already topics on Tripadvisor about Love Holidays. This link below is the main one, it's got 51 pages of people's experiences with them. I don't know how they usually do things. They should have emailed you some kind of confirmation with flight numbers and passenger number on it. Have you looked on the airlines own website and tried to do ""Manage my Booking"" where you would enter in your passenger number and it would show if you are booked on that flight? tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-i12290-k5841…I was just browsing through that link I give you above and there is a LoveHolidays Rep answering questions sometimes. Here below is a link to their Tripadvisor Profile. Click on the Send Message button and type them a Private Message here on TripAdvisor. If they answer you will receive email notification that you have a Private Message waiting for you to read by clicking in the link within the email -tripadvisor.com.au/members/loveholidaysltd"
Any more info on this holiday company? I've just had an email from them for the first time....
"piglet,Did you read through the forum topic I gave a link to in my reply above?. If you want even more information on the company, scroll up to the search box just above the original question by Alice S, type in Love Holidays, and from the drop-down menu choose ""All Forums"". Click Search. That will take you to topic links on the company so you can read other people's experiences with them.Did you make contact with Love Holidays to request information on a holiday, or did you just receive an unsolicited email out of the blue from them, offering you some deal? I suggest you do the forums search on them and read, then judge for yourself if you want to use them."
"From the experience I am presently having with this company in trying to resolve an issue with a holiday I have recently booked. The customer service is not good. If you have booked a holiday through them(I wish I hadn't) I suggest you check with the hotel that what you have been sold is what you are getting. Some of the hotel information/descriptions/choices given on the website are wrong and misguided. I booked a twin superior room. When I received my paperwork it stated a double room. I contacted the hotel directly and they told me that all of their superior rooms are double and they do not have any superior twin rooms. After contacting customer service they checked and admitted the details on the website are wrong. When it came to choosing room on the booking page, the choice was there for a double or twin room. So, the holiday was mis-sold under consumer rights. I keep calling customer service after I was told they would call me back and didnt. I was then told that the investigations apartment would call me back within 48 hours and they havent. The last person I spoke to told me that I should have been given that information by the other two customer service reps that I spoke to. I am now awaiting contact from them as to how this will be resolved. Its stressing me out. In future if booking through an agent I would go in store and speak to one face to face. Then if any problems at least I can go back in and try to solve it face to face. I hope this helps. Good luck :)"
I've regularly noticed discrepancies between room descriptions on various booking sites. It's always wise to check with the hotel itself before making any commitment. It's usually much better to identify and resolve problems at an early stage rather than fight to get something done after you've given a company your money.But good luck in getting a resolution :-)
"Hi all, just posting here as I want to make people aware of the experience we are currently having with Loveholidays.com. Rather than writing the full review on this thread, here is the link to Trust Pilot where I have written a review https:/…loveholidays.com. Essentially though this Monday they withdrew the room in the hotel we have booked for this coming Saturday, have offered us appalling alternatives yet still offer the room type we booked on their own website 'through a different supplier'. 'You could book that room if you like madam, but there would be an additional charge of £1,000'!! Can't believe this kind of thing still happens!"
@jhdraine.... please see post 1. This contains info on how to contact the LH rep who sometimes replies to posts here.
Great thanks! So frustrated!!
I have used Love holidays for the last few yearsThey are helpful when I call and payments are made easy by paying monthly. I cannot fault them. I speak as I find and my experience has been great.
Had a really good holiday with Love Holidays in the last few weeks  no problems at all and very good price
I have been trying to ring there customers services for the last two days no one answers they r suit do the book holidays with them
They don't answer your calls
Once they get ur money they don't answer there cslls
"Please read ALL of the small print on your booking. Love Holiday have just ripped us off for £92 transfers that the hotel were providing free and they charged the balance to a credit card rather than the debit card we said we wanted to use.Complete waste of time speaking to them as my wife was met with a complete blank by the young call handler - ""Oh...it says you have to give us three days notice....blah blah blah.... I cant give you a refund etc. Sounds like another 'profit before customer care' business hiding behind the naivety of youth. Wont be using them again and can in no way recommend them. I would be happy to discuss this if they have the mettle to contact me."
"Research is as vital as reading the T&C's, Stewart."
"Ive been trying to contact Loveholidays today and just hung up after being kept on hold for one hour. They've taken an undue payment from my credit card, even though my booking was cancelled well withing free cancellation period. I do realise its a Bank Holiday Monday, but why place me on hold if they're not answering? Will try again tomorrow. no idea how much the call has cost? Not happy."
"> ""I do realise its a Bank Holiday Monday, but why place me on hold if they're not answering? Will try again tomorrow. no idea how much the call has cost? Not happy.""==> I doubt the sales call centre agent who answered you call knew if the Accounting/Admin department was open today (bank holiday) or not. They would have just transferred your call. Always best to avoid trying to reach the back office business teams on a Sunday or public holiday. Call tomorrow or in the week during regular office hours."
"That is good advice. I expect that most companies like LH would focus on sales and revenue on Sundays and bank holiday Mondays, while their other functions work a more regular schedule."
I've recently booked a holiday with love holidays and I'm absolutely appalled by their service. I cancelled my holiday with them due to finding a better deal still with love holidays. However they are charging me a fee of £377.00. I paid a £98.00 deposit and on their site it said that a fee of £25.00 would be taken which is fair enough. I cancelled the holiday within 30 minutes of booking it and still booked with them but to a different destination. I will not be booking with love holidays again. I'm annoyed that I have booked another holiday with them. The women who my partner spoke to on the phone was rude and not helpful at all. Forget her name. Shocking service. Very unhappy customer.
"I expect that what they did was fully in line with the T&C's you agreed to. If not, then you have grounds to take things further."
"have not received confirmation after 48hrs, is this usual ? Family booked same holiday and had confirmation same day, now concerned some of us booked some not"
"I have no idea on whether this is normal or not, because I've never used this company and it's more than likely that I never will!But if you are concerned, let them know, and see what happens next. Hopefully, everything will be sorted out and you can start looking forward to your holiday :-)"
"I booked accommodation online 48 hours ahead of traveling, for dates in June 2017, confirmation has some random dates in November. When I queried it I was told that ""sometimes the dates change to the cheapest option if you press the ""back"" button"". I didn't do this. The hotel agreed a refund, loveholidays.com are withholding my money as it is non-refundable.. yes, as I booked 48 hours in advance, and not for random November dates on the confirmation.absolutely shocking. BEWARE OF THE BOOKING PROCESS."
"The worst agency ever I booked holidays with them,was sorry but was too late,cause they tik my money straight away from account but nothing was done,flights were not booked,I had to ring them hundred times ,and finally the last minute when I had to fly couldn't check in my tickets horrible service ,never again"
"I have also booked with loveholidays for the past few years as a single mum i cant fault any of the holidays i have booked with them, if i had any issue it was sorted quickly... just booked again for christmas trip away and looking forward to it"
"I always use love holidays, when you book your holiday, they send you out all the information. You have to go to the airlines website, add your details and print off you boarding passes from them."
Just come back from a weeks holiday in Salou first time for me to book with love holiday booked online on the Wednesday and flew on Saturday I have to say everything went really well no problems at all would definitely book with them again

"Reported #30 for language - no need to use the language. We are a travel advice forum, not a chat board. As for the company - I see hundreds of negative threads and posts going back 4 years and more - I don't think they are going out of business anytime soon. After all, people who continue to click, click, buy - with no attention to researching the company they give their money to - are rampant on this forum. Maybe next time consider a google search BEFORE clicking buy."
"Its a pity people don't take the same amount of time to read terms and conditions as they do to join and complain on TA. Love Holidays are no worse than many OTAs, and a lot better than some. As with all online bookings though, you need to know what you're contracting to. Sometimes something that goes wrong is down to the particular agent that's dealing with the booking. I know a couple of their homeworkers, and they're both very good travel agents. I've worked in retail with both of them. Not all agents are good though, in any company."
"MY ADVICE WOULD BE NOT TO BOOK WITH LOVEHOLIDAYSMy whole experience with Loveholidays is one of nothing but stress and anxiety. I simply booked a hotel and flights through them.I became uncomfortable after reading reviews about people being let down a couple of days before departure with their hotel no longer being available. So I contacted our hotel directly and funnily enough – there was no booking for us. Despite reassurance from Loveholidays that everything was in order, quote: “Hi Carol, the hotel have your reservation but our hotel suppliers do not send passenger names over to the hotel until 1 week before departure. Your booking is all confirmed so please do not panic. If there is anything else we can help with then please just let us know. Charlotte”, I could not shake the unease. Lo and behold, a few days later I received an email advising me our accommodation was no longer available. They were happy to take my confirmed quiet, out of town, beach front, spa resort, with sports facilities, 4 pools, various restaurants – all singing and dancing resort - and exchange it for a back street, no facilities, small undesirable hotel, that I wouldn’t want so spend one day in. However, I was ahead of most people who get the standard email, purely because I had time to do something about it. I booked (and payed for) another hotel as a back-up. A hotel incidentally Loveholidays couldn’t book because they said there was no availability! Loveholidays customer service is appalling. Once they receive your booking, their involvement ends. It’s impossible to get through to them on the phone. They never return calls. You have to resort to stealth tactics and trick them into talking to you. When I asked to speak to a manager regarding my problem, she had the audacity to say “I can’t speak to you long, we have others customers waiting”. She had no interest or desire to listen or help.It was only down to pure tenacity and unwillingness to accept their underhand approach that this situation was resolved satisfactorily. I involved ABTA. I did not ease up on the barrage of emails and calls. Finally, a few weeks before departure our original hotel miraculously became available to us.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I would not book with this company, i mistakenly booked a holiday for 1 person instead of 2 and i noticed straight away but was not allowed to speak to anyone to rectify it until i had an email confirming the booking and then it was going to cost me £546 to add a person on, making the holiday cost £1776 instead of £1300 that they were selling it at or to cancel £260. I think it is a disgrace that it could not be rectified as soon as I noticed as it was basically and just an order then, they had not booked it, I got nowhere with them and cancelled as i was still cheaper doing that and booking the same holiday with someone else. They are Rip Offs i would not trust them!"
"While I wouldn't book with LoveHolidays under any circumstances, surely it's much better to get things right in the first place rather than try put things right later?I'm not being smug here. I've made mistakes myself. And they have cost me to put them right on some occasions. And that's my point, really. If you make an error, I think you have to accept that it might cost you, no matter who you book with, because that's usually the way of things."
"Just booked 8 days in Miami with Loveholidays. No flights just hotel room, but wasn't cheap!! During booking process I was not given the opportunity to request specific room type e.g. high floor, none smoking etc. Went on to manage my booking they told me to contact hotel directly. Contacted hotel with booking reference - they have no record of the booking ref or our names. Back to love holidays 7 emails later an automatic response. They only advise our names 2 weeks prior to going. More emails from myself. No response. Phonecalls - still awaiting call back after 33 minutes on hold as all lines were busy. I am extremely worried about this booking. I seem to be going around in circles reiterating mu issues and they respond with same automatic response Any advice"
"Thankyou for your post. I too am having similar problems as you, but as yet they have not cancelled the booked hotel. I do feel very uneasy as you said. I think i too will continue my barrage of emails and probably involve ABTAAny advice from yourself would be useful"
"taylajoel- Depending on how Love Holidays have bought the hotel room, it is very possible that the hotel would not have details of your booking immediately. It could well be as they have said, names confirmed two weeks before arrival. It depends on many factors, how they bought the rooms and the release period of the rooms back to hotelier.Your documents from Love Holidays may even indicate who the supplier of the hotel is. Love Holidays may contract a few hotels directly but I think the majority are procured via what are called Bed Banks or Receptives. Popular ones for Miami might be shown on paperwork as Hotelbeds, Tourico, Bonotel, GTA.You don't mention when you are travelling but I would suggest at about 6 or 7 days out you contact the hotel, perhaps giving them your approximate arrival time and then ask about requests for floor levels etc.I would not be too concerned at this point."
ThankyouYes it is Hotelbeds. We don't travel until October. Just a bit concerned re lack of communication etcEdited: 3 years ago 
"Unfortunately, the cheaper end of the travel booking sites don't really 'do' or at least excel in customer services. In this case with a hotel only reservation, that's about the best it gets. They will book the room. Period. They won't contact the hotel for you and make special requests. A good travel agent would of course do all the nice adds ons for you but of course you might be paying extra for their services. You can of course make contact with the hotel yourself and make requests. It is also a good idea to check your reservation in advance - but as you have found, not too early. Depending on how the Hotelbeds booking was made by Love Holidays and the agreement Hotelbeds has with the hotelier, your reservation will be past to them anytime from shortly after booking, right through to just before your booking starts. The later timeframe however really only when they pre-buy the rooms.I really would worry at this point. Hotels will rarely action requests such as a high floor until shortly before you arrive anyway. Some just as you check in. I would contact the hotel about a week before arrival date.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Oops.Should be ""I really would NOT worry at this point."""
ThankyouI feel much happier
"Love Holidays is a bad company,they put the phone down on you or you get told difficult things by different staff and they never ring you back. They sold me a hotel that ceased trading and can no longer be found on TripAdvisor or google search and even gave me an ATOL certificate for it. Alarm bells rang when I was trying to organise transfers. The hotel had changed names and was now housing refugees waiting deportation from Greece and was not a city hotel but airport hotel, they said it was in a peaceful location next to Science Museum ( in reality that was 45 minutes away hardly next-door or being on airport site hardly peaceful) . They refused to refund me by referring me to cancellation policy when I pointed out that they took money for a hotel that no longer trades so the cancellation policy can't apply, Love Holidays then said I should have used google map to check location. As I was going to abta they changed their website to including 1- picture of the hotel with its new name . They are happy for customers to be stressed out by the poor quality dirty hotels they sell and lose money as long as they make a profit."
">>>they said it was in a peaceful location next to Science Museum ( in reality that was 45 minutes away hardly next-door or being on airport site hardly peaceful) .<<<Don't rely on anything you're told by any company. Check things out for yourself, and then double chack to be sure. Some of these people will tell you anything you want to hear in order to get you to book, as you've found out.>>>Love Holidays then said I should have used google map to check location.<<<That's my advice too, though it doesn't have to be Google Maps. Other mapping services are available."
"It's all very well saying we learn from our mistakes but this Company appears not to or does not want to improve. Found this on another website if anyone wants to complaint higher up in the management ladder:Little information for you:-CEO Mr Alex Frances alex@loveholidays.comHead office:-Worthing House, 2 – 6 High Street Worthing West Sussex BN11 3AETel:- 01903 258 288Edited by Glynis HT Admin 1 month 1 day agoEdited: 3 years ago "
"There are some companie sabout who don't want to improve. They see no point, because trying to get better will cost them money and they get sufficient customers to make a profit while providing a poor or average level of service.I'd say that there's very little chance of the CEO getting to read any complaint that's addressed to them. It's normally passed back down the line to customer services, though sometimes, depending on the nature of the complaint, it may be given to someone more senior to compose a reply that will be signed off by the CEO."

"guys I know how you all feel about this company. just back from ibersol Mediterranean suites in Salou. most awful experience in last twenty years of holidaying. hotels was an absolute joke, looked amazing in the love holiday website pictures but was old, poorly maintained and more suitable to a stag/hen weekend than a family holiday. no cleaning service, had to ask reception for toilet paper when ran out and was only allowed one at a time. two hundred guests with only 19 loungers at pool. pool so small that when more than 6/7 people in it it was impossible to do anything other than stand in it. cracked tiles everywhere cleaning staff refused to take rubbish from outside our front door we had to take it down the street and dump it ourselves. we also had to wait almost 7 hours to get our room after arrival. along with 3 other English and Irish families who arrived at around same time as us. receptionist was a complete ....... won't even say it but you can guess what I mean. we paid just shy off €1000 for 3 people for eight nights for this hotel and it is rated as three stars which honestly is a out and out lie. love holidays did reply when contacted although next day but required us to do all the leg work and take pictures write reports etc so that they could maybe get us a new room in the same hotel. we saw some of the other rooms and weren't best pleased ours was better than most and you could not swing a small kitten in ours so why bother wasting our time and effort trying to do what they should have done themselves. will never use love holidays again and advise all Irish English Welsh and Scots to never go to this hotel. this is only a quick breakdown of the issues with the hotel. I have listed over 47 issues with the hotel in the week I spent there. ps mattresses on beds 3 inches thick and much less when laid on. awful hotel awful booking agent awful experience of Salou which In itself is a lovely holiday destination"
Hotel operatiosn are a matter for the hotel. What were the reviews on websites like this one like when you checked the hotel out?Have you written a review of the acommodation yourself so that you can help others?
"I'm no fan of LoveHolidays or any of the OTAs. I can't see a point in using them.Website pictures and information come from the property themselves. OTAs and tour operators don't invent them. You can see the size of the pool on the website so that shouldn't have been a surprise. I've stayed in s/c apartments where both rubbish removal and toilet paper weren't included, and 'star' ratings on OTAs and tour op websites are an opinion which should only be used as a guide. Reviews are generally positive so far this year.As for the lack of sunbeds, quality of mattresses and anything operational are down to the hotel. LoveHolidays are only an agent and you can't expect every agent to inspect every property they sell. This is where personal research comes into it's own prior to booking. Obviously we don't know what time you arrived at reception but if it was early morning then I would expect a long wait. If it was afternoon then I wouldn't."
"brains2bryne- please make sure you lodge a complaint with ABTA which can be done online, whilst ABTA may not necessarily take action against Love Holidays as Love Holidays hide behind being a travel agent it will highlight to ABTA that this Love Holidays are doing this all too much. Even if ABTA are not able to help it demonstrates that you have attempted to reach a reasonable resolution. Also please keep evidence by screen shots from their website that the imagines are different to the actual holiday (so that anyone can see it's 'not as described '). You can claim the money back from your credit card using As the booking was less than 120 days ago and accordingly, I can claiming a full charge back as it was an online purchase and you are allowed a cooling off period under section 75. The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 as it was goods from a Business that were misleading description/ misleading omissions and/ aggressive selling. The images from Love Holidays website will show that the hotel is not as described at the time of your booking. This is the same legislation that your solicitor would use. Also you can show the bank how many hotels Love Holidays sell that are misleading from doing a simple internet search as this will make it clear it's a dodgy company.Please also consider writing a Trust Pilot review for Love Holidays as they use Trust Pilot as an independent reviewing company so they don't like any negative reviews on it. At the end of the day Love Holidays state don't belief the TripAdvisor reviews so it's not fair that others tell you you should have checked or put a negative review on for the hotel - the issue is that this dodgy company Love Holidays sells hotels that they know are unsuitable . I have notified them about a hotel below par and they continue to sell it in their website regardless of the number of customer complaints ."
If you scroll down this thread there is the email address for the CEO for Love Holidays : if everyone keeps emailing him they will have to a lot of complaints to deal with or have to change their supplier as there is one big bed supplier these large companies use.
"Do not book you're holiday with this company!!!!!. We booked a last minute deal and when we checked where the hotel was on google maps we couldn't find it. We contacted the love hoildays and they couldn't find it either. They said they would get us an address for the hotel. This didn't happen. Now we have to choose another hotel and pay a top up because of we don't, we will lose £150 of the money. You think you are getting a bargain but it's all a scam.Edit"
just trying to let everyone know that love holidays and the ibersol Mediterranean suites are both to be avoided unless you want an experience that you'll regret. regards checking hotels services and the like is that not why people use such agents as love holidays? they are selling rooms and apartments on the rating and say of the hotels when they should be checking them out for themselves. they advertised over forty hotels in the Salou area when we did our check of their site. they do not have agents or reps to deal with issues like ours unlike agents like Thompson's or Thomas Cook or other high Street agents who provide similar services but have a rep available to deal with issues whilst abroad. if I buy a washing machine from a supplier my contract is with the supplier not the manufacturer. so having paid love holidays the money should it not be to them to ensure that the product they are selling is of a suitable standard and that the pictures supplied by the hotel are true and accurate. again I don't believe that a company with so many complaints against it is acting in a fair and truthful manner and that it should be brought to book for it's inadequacies. I'm just highlighting both these parties for the scam a artists they are.
has anyone noticed that the people on this site who are suggesting that the problems are down to lack of searching by the complainants regards the hotel quality etc have tens of thousands of forum posts. could this be the online travel agency trying to apportion the blame onto the poor saps like myself who worked their posteriors off for twelve months just to get a few days away in the sun only to be ripped off and to be more stressed than before they left to get away from all the stresses me day to day life. wise up and stop making it the fault of the wronged. you may experience this yourselves someday and might need to vent yourself
"brains2byrne,Nobody here works for any company. Tripadvisor has forum posting guidelines and company promotors would get their account closed down by Tripadvisor staff. Everybody is just a member like you. anyone with tens of thousands of forum posts may be a long-time Tripadvisor member, being on this site asking and answering questions for 10-15 years. Some could be Destination Experts for various forums. Do you know what a Destination Expert is on the forums? Not sure if you are on the full website or the limited Tripadvisor APP, but on the full website you can see details of who people are and which forums they are Destination Expert for displayed under their username and photo, and you can click on anyone's username and get into their profile and look at which forums they post on and what they say. We can read all of each other's forum postings, stretching back maybe 15 years. That will soon show you nobody here is a Representative of Love Holidays.If people have been focussing on the vital need to check before booking and research before handing over your money it's because every day in these forums we all see people who could have avoided all the stress, loss of money and ruined holiday plans if they had checked on a companies reputation before booking. It's not blaming anyone, just trying to raise awareness of the need to protect ourselves by checking and researching a bit to make sure a company has a good reputation for service and reliability. We all work hard for our wages, or some people may be retired and on a fixed income and wanting to travel. It's so important for all of us to use great resources like Tripadvisor to read reviews of hotels and research travel companies before using them. Or even using Google and typing in a travel company name and the words reviews and complaints can bring up a lot of results to read. Then hopefully we can be pre-warned, choose to book elsewhere and don't have the need to vent after a bad experience.Edited: 3 years ago "
"@brains.... trip advisor does not have a forum for reviewing travel companies, escorted tours. or travel agents, including OTA's. Hotels themselves have publicly posted reviews & Air travel forum has airline reviews. I suspect the reason why TA doesn't have travel company etc reviews is that there are just too many companies to prevent planted reviews or covert advertisement. So, the Bargain forum has by default become the place where most people come to complain, or make a single post to vent.The DE's and regulars here are all volunteers, & have tried to assist posters here by writing numerous information articles, about how OTA's work, planning, and the outstanding topics from the "" Know How To..."" range. These take time and effort to put together,& are intended to inform posters about all their options and hopefully prevent people from being ripped off. Sadly they can't be seen on the very limited TA phone app & can only be accessed using a pc/laptop or tablet. . If people don't make use of all the free advice & information here, it's inevitable that some of them will get ripped off. But it's not because the DE's & regulars haven't tried to help."
"I have an email from Love Holidays customer services staff telling me that the hotel they sold been ceased trading and I am not entitled to a refund or different hotel. How could I have researched that? They are continuing to advertise the hotel on their website knowing full well it ceased trading is that right ? I work hard for my money doing 2 and sometimes 3 jobs as a single parent my wage is important. I don't think it's correct that consumers are blamed for not doing their research. To me its morally wrong to continue to sell a hotel knowing it has ceased trading, I have not put that email in this website but I can if you want . Love Holidays are scammers"
"@rains... 1.If you paid by credit card, then contact your credit card company. You'll need to forward the email from Love Holidays. 2.If you didn't use a cc, then contact your travel insurance company. 3. If you didn't use a cc and didn't have travel insurance, next option is to contact ABTA. You'll need the ABTA registration number from Love Holidays website.4. Last option is to start small claims case in your local county court. The CAB can advise on what to do, the forms to use and the fees.5. If Love Holidays have a Facebook page, consider posting there too, but stick strictly to the facts, and don't include personal information."
I want to find the forums not great with this but loveholidays are crooks as they advertised and sold me a 3 star hotel while it was on paper 2 star i went all inclusive to find that my hotel had no food licence from greek authorities worse holiday ever ruinned my summer i will be taking legal action froud crooks the lot of them
what a scummers i was bullied threatened but i stud strong i shot a all documentary on my holidays also had interviews from all other holiday makers from many nationalities and will be offering it to either itv or bbc after the editing also planing legal action on this fraudelent company of cowboys
they advertised a 3 star place and the place was 2 stars well on paper as in real 0 star is that a ground for law suit?
i send many emails to their ceo none of them got a reply
"@Jani...star ratings mean nothing at all. There is no agreed international standard. There are cheaper and faster resolutions to your complaint as I have highlighted in post 62.Unless you are using the small claims procedure, legal options are expensive and time consuming. A good solicitor will advise you whether or not you have an admissible case, and whether the costs of such legal action will outweigh the action. . If you incurred a loss you will need evidence, so don't discard any receipts for items/goods etc which you still have. Your insurance policy will cover medial costs, & cannot be included in a legal claim, as you cannot be compensated twice for the same loss.Before you go on holiday again, you may wish to read the accommodation reviews in the specific destination forum, from which to make an informed decision.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Jani star ratings, unless they're the official rating of the tourist board pertaining to the country, are just opinions, nothing else. LoveHolidays actually point that out to you in the terms and conditions you presumably didn't read. LoveHolidays are an agent, nothing more. They advertise what their suppliers give them to advertise. Information and photos have come from the property involved. Maybe you should be taking this up with the company that you had a contract with, Love Holidays supplier. Their name will be on your paperwork, and if you had a problem in resort they are the company you needed to contact while you were there. You're not going to get a reply from a CEO. It's not their job to deal with complaints. Their office passes them to the relevant dept to be dealt with.Maybe researching before you book is the way to go?Edited: 3 years ago "
well so love holidays sell 3 star hotel when in the hotel licence is a 2 star is this legal?is it legal to sell all inclusive holidays when the hotel dont have restaurant or kitchen nor dining area and neither licence for food?i am determined to go all way with this and i shoot a full documentary that will be televised withing any costs i am member of press and a film maker good luck to love holidays
yes you are right i did not research as i was overwemed with my sons operation outcome i just wanted to go away and make my family happy that is alli did tho make a good video for the british tv and will make the rest of us aware
is not just a complaint now is that the ceo or their press officer will have to give their side of the story to my film
i booked on the telephone in a hurry i know i am the only one to blame who do we trust now? lol
"@Jani... I'm sorry you've been unwell, and that time prevented you from adequately researching the accommodation you booked. However, I suggest you just put this sorry episode behind you and learn from the experience.You've stated that you were to blame for making a rushed decision. Taking legal action takes money. Possibly more money than the cost of the actual holiday itself. A solicitor will advise you of the costs involved, & whether a court will adjourn with liberty to restore once all the other dispute resolutions have been exhausted. Contacting TV companies is an option, but is highly unlikely to yield you any compensation. I assume it is compensation you are seeking? The legal departments of TV companies will ultimately provide permission to broadcast, to prevent them from being sued.As other posters have already said, a CEO will not reply to a complaints email. This would be passed onto customer services. I am not unsympathetic, but feel you are not going to get a resolution, be that an apology or compensation unless you followed the well established processes for your resolving your complaint.Edited: 3 years ago "
well thank you i am a member of press i shoot a full documentary i have 3 hours worth of footage interviews and so on ill make my money back anyways but i dont want others to suffer i am a sucker for justice i spend 45 k last 3 years suing companies that keep changing names so i am happy to do that but cheers for the advice if no one rises to the crooks we always will be taken for a ride and i am not the one to be riden trust me i am like this
"Jani J: Please come back and share how your lawsuit goes. I am skeptical, but who knows. If you have deep pockets and time to afford, maybe you can be the one who wins? As for the rest, PLEASE do better research before handing over your money to a company you don't know - any company you don't know."
Please come back and tell us when your documentary will be aired and on what network.
Maybe the press put as little care into their holidays as they seem to do in to their journalism these days ;)
"I'm waiting with eager anticipation for the documentary., it'll be highly entertaining I'm sure... the grammar, the factual content, the production values and content integrity will surely be something to behold.Jani JIf you mean, "" as a member of the press"" that you are an accredited Journalist, then, spellchecker and poor grammar notwithstanding, the public are highly unlikely to have any interests in your scribbles here or on the small screen either somehow. Good luck with finding a commissioning agent to buy your "" documentary"".I don't think the Rank Organisation, who made the "" Carry On"" films, are in business any longer..And , BTW, if a "" member of the press"" can't spell the word "" fraud"" at least consistenty, then I fear for the future of journalism in this country! , I'll get the popcorn ...Edited: 3 years ago "

They sound like some saddo that goes out of their way purposely to find fault with things, just to get their 5 minutes of fame, oh and make some money of course. Maybe we're seeing a new type of ambulance chaser?"

"Love Holidays is advertising the Margaret Studios in Kremasti on an all-inclusive basis from £20.57 per person per night. Thats the selling price after any mark up and margin applied by the travel company. I suspect that the actual hotelier is getting around £15-£17 pppn on those lead prices for the supply of the room, all food and all drinks.Whether a 2 or 3 star graded hotel, I think at those sorts of prices I would be very wary of the likely quality and offering of the hotel and their all-inclusive plan."

as we travel to costa blanca in four weeks time we are getting worried about events in spain at the moment .could you advise us what to do if it not safe to go there .we are two pensioners aged 77 and78 please could you answer thank you
"Follow the Foreign Office advice. If they say it's not safe to travel to Spain, you will likely get your money back. If they don't you will could well struggle to get any kind of a refund, even from your insurance company."
"Unless the FCO issue an advisory against travel you will not get a refund if you cancel, and your insurance doesn't cover for changing your mind."
"Do not book through loveholidays. Had a terrible experience, arrived at hotel to be to,d we were being moved due to overbooking. Had heard nothing in advance of this as we should have been given chance to accept or cancel. We contacted loveholidays straight Away and requested to be moved. Sat around waiting, waiting and waiting. I had to keep calling them as to what was happening and our first day was ruined as well as our anniversary. Was promised phone call by end of day with plans as to arrangement to being moved back to our hotel, never got them! Next day sat wiaiting and waiting. Finally got through to customer services due to time difference, they agreed that I had recieved awful service and was promised a call from manager. Never got it. Have put in a claim for two days of holiday wasted being sat in limbo and no communication from these as well as having anniversary day ruined and they have tried fobbing me off with they are not accountable. I am taking my dispute further. Shocking treatment, shirked my compensation claim and had the audacity to offer a voucher off of booking with them again!"
Anna A - what was the hotels position on this when you were having to hang around the hotel lobby awaiting Love Holidays to call? It is very likely that it was the hotel that overbooked as so it was actually them that should have been trying to resolve this for you.
"Sounds like a classic case of hotel overlooking and not informing the bedbank. If they don't know they can't tell the agent, and the agent can't tell the customer. Its not the agents fault because they can't overbook. They have no contact with the hotel."
"Agreed. I think the same thing could have happened with any number of booking sites, not just Love Holidays."
"It is Love Holidays fault as they should be checking with their supplier, love Holidays paid the supplier so they are responsible. The booking wasn't made direct with the hotel but using Love Holidays . If you look at the Love Holiday terms and conditions section 2 it states they will refund or move to another hotel if this happens or hotel goes insolvent. As an ABTA member they have to fulfil the ABTA duty of care which means they have a duty to protect consumers not rip them off"
"Much as I sympathise with you sadly you re the architect of your own misfortune. The company did provide T & C's, but you decided not to read them. It appears that you didn't research the actual accommodation booked , nor research this company either. For future reference, you may wish to read the info articles that are in the Top Questions box.These items include the Know How To.... series, with topics ranging from accommodation, flights. travel insurance etc. There's also an item on OTA's. The Trip Advisor phone app is too limited to show all this info, so you'll need a laptop/pc or tablet to access the full trip advisor web content.Edited: 2 years ago "
"mcpinder is right. Havign read your story, it appears to me that you made lots of assumptions (eg that All inclusive = Premium) wihtout actually checking much out. You say you entered into a contract with LH, but it seems you didn't even check what the terms of the contract were. If you had, you'd have known that LH aren't responsible for the operation of the accommodation, the facilities or the standard of service there. They can't be, in fairness, they are just a booking agent. They haven't recommended anything, you chose the hotel, at the end of the day. So I'm afraid you have to take some of the responsibility, particularly if you didn't check out the reviews to see what the reality was behind the glossy descriptions provided by the accommodation themselves.This is not an excuse for them not infomring you about the flights, but they are a company that's had more than it's fair shar eof complaints here."
U have to book by airlines one month before flight using ur ref no
"DISASTROUS EXPERIENCE WITH LOVE HOLIDAYS in relation to flights, transfers, hotel and total lack of customer care/service or responsibility for anything in the event of a failure on their part. They claim then to be a booking agent only, not a holiday company. They take your money but offer absolutely no reassurance or accountability. FULL REVIEW: https:///uk.trustpilot.com/review/loveholidays.com"
"SECunningham writes:""THIS IS NOT A TRAVEL COMPANY, JUST A BOOKING AGENT WHO TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF THINGS GO WRONG""Yes. Yes. Yes. You got it. You figured it out. It should come as no surprise whatsoever that your deduction as to Love Holiday's position should reflect exactly what they tried to tell you. Which was:""As just an agent, we accept no liability in relation to any contract you enter into with the Service Provider(s), or for any services or arrangements you purchase, or for the acts or omissions of any other person(s) or party(ies) connected with any Arrangement."" Yes, the flights were messed up, but it should never have come to that, because the above condition should have put you off using them at all. Forget that stuff about having no reason to go the bottom of the page. I went through the booking process there, up to the point of being asked to enter names, and I couldn't move from one step to the next without a request coming into view to read the Terms and Conditions, and each request included a statement of the essential fact that they were just an agent and nothing more. You just chose not to read it. Yours was indeed one of the most miserable experiences we've heard related here. You paid a high price for the lesson about how to book trips. We do what we can to guide people who come here to ask questions. I think most of them get here by searching for reviews of suppliers and travel sites before they book. We simply have no way to reach the others who just assume things are the way they would like them to be. Why they make that assumption about anything they find on the Internet is beyond me."
"That's very nicely put, 5thGenTexan. LH make it perfectly clear that they are a booking agent not a travel company. SECunningham is, sadly, far from alone in having higher expectations than is the reality, or of failing to read the T&C's."
"We had a similar experience with Love Holidays where we booked early in the year and then one of the ""bed"" companies went bust but we were not told until we had paid the full amount which was 2 months later. They then proceeded to offer us other accommodation which was not appropriate and when asked why they did not inform us when it happened they said ""they deal with the holidays as they come up in date order""!!!! We ended up in a reasonable hotel but not where we wanted to be and they expected us to pay for the privilege of having drinks included and tried to add £350 to the package - despite the fact that we had all inclusive at the original hotel (including drinks) - I did argue the point and eventually spoke to the manager and just paid £35 for the privilege!!! - I would never use then again.Christine"
"I think they have a point, Christine. When something happens like a bed company going out of business, companies need to deal with people in priority order. That means by the dates they have booked in practice. Remember also that LH won't have a lot of resources that they can throw at sorting people out. There's no way that they'll be able to deal with everyone quickly. It's going to take time to contact customers, offer them alternatives, and wait for the response.I'm not saying that they are a good company, I wouldn't go anywhere near them myself, just trying to point out the realities of the situation.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Having contacted their ""Customer Services"" department i can honestly say that they are abusing the phrase customer service.I would not use this company again, they are not at all knowledgeable about the properties they are selling and are not very helpful when you do have an issue, they are not interested in customer feedback at all.Stay clear of this company, do your research thoroughly before booking ANY hotel, read lots of reviews and check the area of where you are looking to stay."
yes you are right many members here defend them not sure why i think they have links with thembut i tottally aggree with you look on daily mail article where they are mentioned on 5th of this month and you will see this we are right
"With referece to my most recent post, as I said, I was pointing out the realities of the situation. That is not the same as defending them. Of course, I don't know if you're referring to anything I wrote, Jani."
How is your TV documentary coming along Jani J?
No Roji I said it in general from my past experiences in here we come here to give our review and see if any good advice not to be taken for a easy ride ok I did mistake not reasearching first time I booked my own holiday usually some one from the office did or I went somewhere and booked there I have good network abroad this time I wanted to doit Iike anyone else I did not know travel industry is so badly runned and not regulated not just love holidays but a bunch of other agents I am scared to book another holiday lol
"OK, Jani, fair enough. I am sometimes accused of taking one side or the other when trying to explain how things work in practice. I just wan tto help understand the truth of things so that they don't get caught again."
RojBlake if you know the law please tell me how does all this works LH sold me a 3 star hotel actually is a 2 star they admited that even on daily mail now they saying they just booking agent but you travel telling me on email officially that my contract is with Lh as i paid them and booked on phone to them when many people including abta telling me otherwise now is travel industry so badly regulated that travel agents taking the hard working public for a ride?
"RojBlake - I actually had a good experience with LH. I used them to book a hotel in Mexico - they were WAY cheaper than any other website. I had my reservations and did a lot of research before booking to make sure it was the hotel I wanted. I confirmed the reservation with the hotel 3 days after booking and everything was as it seemed. I don't think I'd ever book a full holiday through them - I always book direct with airlines - and would definitely decide on my hotel first and follow up immediately directly with the hotel (like I did this time) to ensure it's reserved. It's buyer beware, make sure you know what you're looking for and be proactive about making sure your holiday details are in order."
well said texan as i booked over the phone was all read fast to me but u right i learned a lesson and i am not the kind of person letting thinks go i havent finish yet when i am finished and done then ill let you know the outcome i know i should let it go but i am not from a place that we let thinks go my principald r deeper than my wallet
u r right i always did it that way but this year we had a hard year in a family of 3we had 4 operations so far betwen us so far few more to come and as soon as we got a breathing space overwelmed i picked up the phone and did mess it all up my thinking as i am not greek but fluent in greek as i lived there few years in my youth i said what can it happend greeks usually friendly nice food even if is small some greek mother will cook something went there to find hungarian hospitality in greek island lol every one here is making this sound like is just my fault is like every one blaming the little boy for not securing his pushbike properly and was stolen no one is blaming the thief in this place like in some other forums this is the funniest advice i am ever getting here especially from the texan lolEdited: 2 years ago 
"We're not here to point out that there are online sites that are sly, misleading or plainly crooked. God knows that's apparent after reading this forum for a few minutes. It is, in fact, the primary reason we're here, doing what we do, because, all other things aside, it is painful to see someone's joyous trip ruined. But we have long studied the way these things work, and we know that the primary wrongdoer, the one with no excuse, was the hotel that misrepresented the accommodations. It's true that the agent's business model doesn't provide protections for those who use the site, but none of this would have happened but for the hotel.And be truthful. What would you tell the little boy who knew there were thieves about and didn't protect his bicycle? You know exactly what you would say. ""Those were very mean people, those thieves. Why didn't you lock your bike?"" If that's not what you would say, I wish you could have been my mother, because that's what mine said, along with telling me I could just wait a while before she replaced my bicycle. I do hope you return to report the outcome. It will also serve as another lesson on why one must take great care, because there is usually no way to repair the loss."
"I'm not a lawyer by any means, Jani, but I do know that you can't always rely on star ratings. Some questions to ask yourself is where do these ratings come from? Are they officially awarded by a tourist organisation in that country? Are they a holiday company's own idea of what the hotel should be described as? Are they based on facilities, as many official schemes are?I'm sure there ar eothers, but that will do for now.To try and illustrate my point, I;ve staye dins ome wonderful places that have been given a star rating or one or two. They have been spotlessly clean, very comfortable indeed, well located, and run/staffed by some lovely people. They haven't had more stars because they don't have things like a swimming pool, a 24 hour reception, or a restaurant.I've also stayed in some less than brilliant 4 and 5 star establishments, Yes, they've had a pool, a restuarant opr even retaurants, bar, spa and whatever else may have gotten them those stars, but the quality just hasn't been so good.Moving on to more general points, I think an issue is I wouldn't call LH a travel agent. They may technically fall under such a description, but to me, a travel agency operates in a different way. I'm glad that Bexiboo had a good experience, and I regularly say here that even the worst companies in the world will ge tthings right more than they get things wrong (assuming the are not criminals or scammers).I like 5thGenTexans comment about the pushbike. Yes, the thief is wrong, and in this case the hotel is guilty of misrepresenting themselves. But we also encourage and allow people to get away with bad behaviour if we ar etoo trusting and not careful, enough. That's the lesson here as I see it. Don't allow yourself to be a victim. At the end of the day, if you trust everyone, there are always going to be some who abuse that trust, and they will walk all over you if you let them."
Ref LVE 267424 flying with Ryanair from Newquay Cornwall 3rd October 2017 22 of us in the group.booking in my name Celia Hammett group members phoning m regarding flights with Ryanair can anyone help as to what I should do
"CeliaSpeak to the airline, but first, remove your post.It is madness to post your booking ref, departure date and real name in a worldwide public forum.Stay safe on-line folks!"
Beware of booking through this company:loveholidayshttps://www.loveholidays.com/…There site looks like a package holiday site and you see the ATOL and ABTA signs but they did not book us a package holiday.They booked us onto Ryan air and an expensive all inclusive hotel in Teneriffe. When Ryan air started cancelling flights this week they tried to claim they were just a booking agent and had no responsibility to us. We would loose our flight money if we cancelled and booked with another carrier and would have to wait for cancellation notice before a refund or an alternative flight was found. We then found out that if we couldn't get their we here non refundable in our hotel and that would be 2 grand up the spout. The ATOL/ABTA signs apparently count for nothing with this BOOKING AGENT. It took a long time on the phone to find this out and my argument that they took our money so our contract is with them so they are liable held no truck with this shower.My advice: Do not book with this company and go with a reputable package holiday operator.Joe
"The real lesson is that in a competitive industry when the suppliers are already trying to offer their services as cheaply as possible and who want you book direct so they don't have to share with an agent, it doesn't make any sense that you can get the same service even cheaper by buying it from someone who is also going to want to keep a portion of it as commission. But you just wanted it cheaper and didn't inquire how they were to perform this economic miracle. You now know that they do it by booking without rights to cancel and without the possibility of refund. They could also have booked with two legs each way, using two airlines and separate tickets, because that is often the very cheapest way to get somewhere. But if your first flight had been late, you would have no assistance and would have to pay again to go on. But you wanted it cheaper, remember. And while none of those things are very good things to do if you want a worry-free trip, in all fairness, they did tell you that they merely helped you book and then left you on your own with the supplier. They really did tell you that, or tried to. But you have not learned the second lesson, which is that the above is true for virtually every other such travel site, and you run the same risks with all of them."
"I totally agree with you regards LH stating they are a booking agent, but what they do is to take your money for a booking they do not make or intend to make. We booked and paid a deposit for trip to Cyprus back in May for end of September. within a few days we had to re-arrange the date by one week. So we knew it was going to cost. We dealt with airline direct and paid again for flights as they were non cancellable and as told by LH we contacted the Hotel who had said they did not have a booking for us.We contacted LH many times asking for help but they were very unhelpfull in fact totally useless, so we contacted the hotel and were told they had no booking for us. We then made arrangements with another hotel which was better and cheaper. We go next week! We are now being hounded by LH to pay the full amount and yet there is still no booking for us at the original hotel.I have told them to take us to court and we will counterclaim for the deposit taken under false pretences!Would love to go to court! They are definately cashing in on peoples inexperiences!All we can do is to expose them and remind people to be more careful, which is what your message is."
"In fact as I posted the last message we recieved an email that charged us a £395 cancellation fee, if they are merely an agent how is this justified? especially as they havent booked or paid for anything!Edited: 2 years ago "
Ouch!
"Okay but in the UK we have a number of bodies which ensure htat sites make there 'offer' very clear. I have reported this to the Trading Standards Office, Advertising Standards and Office of Fair Trading and they are investigating to see if the side is misleading. It is up to websites to ensure their offer is fair and if it's not it could be fraud. I don;t have to check to see if it is correct - they must tell me what it is I'm entering into up front,Do't know how it works in the USA but I might be very wary of booking anything there if the rules are not the same or not upheld."
Have you though about small claims?

"@145/146 -RichardFDepending on the arrangements LoveHolidays have with the supplier of the hotel room (not necessarily direct with the hotel) it is quite possible that the hotel would not have your names or booking information immediately. In some cases they might not receive the information until either a week or so before your arrival, or even in some cases just a day or so before. This does not mean that you don't have a room at the hotel just that the hotel does not have the full details of the reservation.I suspect most of LoveHoliday's supply of hotel rooms come via 3rd party bed banks. It is these bed banks which contract the rooms with the hotel, or sell rooms between themselves. These room blocks will be held by the 3rd party and details of sold/unsold rooms plus corresponding guest names will only be provided to the hotelier at a predetermined release date. Up to that time the hotelier will only know that he has say 10 rooms allocated to Bed Bank A but no guest names. To further muddy the water, some bed banks will even have a pre-buy or guarantee agreement whereby they commit to using x number of rooms. In these cases the hotelier might not even receive guest names until the day of arrival.I fear that you may have created a problem for yourself by assuming that there was no hotel reservation after calling the hotel but not checking this out further with LoveHolidays. I can see why they might be chasing you to pay the balance for the hotel booking - a booking that in fact has been there all along."
"@143 - Joe G""They booked us onto Ryan air and an expensive all inclusive hotel in Teneriffe. When Ryan air started cancelling flights this week they tried to claim they were just a booking agent and had no responsibility to us. We would loose our flight money if we cancelled and booked with another carrier and would have to wait for cancellation notice before a refund or an alternative flight was found.""- strictly speaking that information is correct and you would find the same issue if you booked with another discounting online travel agency. Booking a package holiday with a reputable tour operator would be different and you would have more protection should one element of the holiday be changed or cancelled.- Ryanair are getting a lot of flack (rightly so) about these cancelled flights over the coming weeks. They are meant to be publishing all of the affected flights by tomorrow. Until that time if you decide to cancel your flight (before being told by Ryanair that your service is one that is being cancelled) then normal conditions apply and you would loose the payment made for the flight. The agent can't change this.- I think in this case your anger should be redirected to Ryanair and not LoveHolidays. - Hopefully you will be one of the 98% of Ryanair customers who's flights operate as planned.""It took a long time on the phone to find this out and my argument that they took our money so our contract is with them so they are liable held no truck with this shower.""- in fairness how they operate their business is well covered on their website and within their terms and conditions of trading. These you presumably read and agreed to?- your 'argument' is sadly flawed as you have not understood the arrangements that you have entered into and the terms and conditions of booking via LoveHolidays.- the same T&C's explain who your agreement is with - the airline/hotel, rather than LoveHolidays who act as an Agent.I do hope that all works out for you and that your Ryanair flights are not impacted.Enjoy Tenerife but perhaps take this experience as an example of some of the draw backs of booking a non-bonded package holiday."
Worst travel company ever do not book with them - save yourself the hassle and stress go to thomas cook - the service at love holidays is bad staff are rude they will hang up on you. will not reply. they got our holiday wrong and never reply to our emails calls. Do not book with love holidays please we met people in resort who funnily enough said the same thing worst travel company ever!!!! Do not even bother going to there website or calling them such rude staff!!!!!!!!
"Please take T_U's advice on board for the future, it's good stuff. In particular, it's right that a contract isn't about who you give your money to, but about the T&C's that govern it. It's true that we have legilation in the UK to ensure that T&C's are fair, but that doesn't mean that they can automatically be overruled."
"""It's true that we have legislation in the UK to ensure that T&C's are fair, but that doesn't mean that they can automatically be overruled.""I tried to imagine what would be patently unfair. I suppose that saying. ""You hereby agree to additional terms and conditions that will remain secret until we wish to invoke them."" would be unfair. Or maybe telling you there would be a fee of unspecified amount and then charging twice the cost of a room, rather than some fee that reflected the service rendered would probably be held unfair. But mostly, the T&C statements I've seen would be held to be fair, since they're in reasonable language and available for view when you're prompted to say if you agree. And fairness, while it might be enforced through some (probably excruciating) process by a government agency, wouldn't move a credit card issuer to break the contract for you."
"The law is intended to prevent whooly unreasonable T&C's, preferably so that they don't get written in the first place. On example would be 'If you elect to cancel anything we will charge you an additional sum of £2000, or 200% of the original booking, whichever is the greater, to cover our costs'."
so lets have an update to all of you that did not believe on me after a battle and ping pong talks no need to go to court loveholidays awarded me full refund for the accomodation so how about that thank you to all of you that did not believe on me lol
rip off britain has most of the video footages daily mail already has the story published i will put video soon on youtube mr traveler undercoverEdited: 2 years ago 
Can't wait to see your footage Jani J. Do you have a link to the Daily Mail story as I don't waste my money on buying that rag?
It's ok. I found it on the Daily Mail online site.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-4…The Daily Mail are also giving up to 50% discounts on Love Holidays trips discountcode.dailymail.co.uk/love-holidays
travel undercover i would be happy to send u some of them raw unedited via we transfer trust me is amazing footage or would u like the sound recording of the hotel owner trying to bribe me up lol
"Jani J: Despite what I may previously have thought - I'm glad you disputed your bill and got resolution for the issues. BUT, the fact still remains that if you had researched better who and what you were buying BEFORE booking them, you could likely have avoided this all. In my mind, advance research always wins."
">>>In my mind, advance research always wins.<<<I totally agree. To my mind it's just much easier to avoid having to battle with companies afterwards."
excellent company booked with them 3 times
lovely holiday company booked with them 3times
Milkybri in posts #164 and #165Welcome to TA today.Do please tell us more...I'm sure we'd love to get a lot more details of your personal experiences of a company that other think are thoroughly shonky...Regards Mondial
"Have you had any joy with your holiday , I've never booked through love holidays and very nervous after reading reviews which I wish had done first Booked. Holiday they have taken the money from my bank but have not had any confirmation except from the flights confirming 2 seats yet the holiday is booked for 4 people !! I've rang 3 times now and no one at low holidays can give me an answer , they also can't find my booking because I have not had a confirmation with a reference number , they were happy to take the money so I've paid a lot of money for what appears to be nothing !!"

"I booked through love holidays and have to say that everything went perfect we spoke to a real person on the phone who was very helpful and within hours we got a conformation email which was all correct.After I booked I came on TA and then found all the bad stories about them which sent me into a panic so after advice on here I emailed the hotel direct who confirmed our booking.The shuttle transfer was all there waiting with our names and was also on time for the return,I was one of those people who did not bother to reshearch the T&Cs about them and how they operate we were at the end of our teather trying to find a suitable holiday and Love Holidays were the only ones that had it and so jumped on it.So a success story but not sure if I would book with them again because I just had 8 months of worry after reading all the bad things on this forum about them.I think if you get the conformation and all is correct then you are 90% there, it seems that is there are any issues then it is a nightmare to sort it. Also some people just read the hotel info supplied by Love hols and go with that which leads to issues but I always check the TA reviews and street view and satalight so there are no surprises - or disappointments when I arrive.Edited: 2 years ago "

Yes and yes.
I have had a nightmare with this company booked holiday to Cuba I tried to emend hotel sent email 3 different hotels they reply with prices to change one was £88 pound I sent email back to emend 3 hours later lady phoned me up she said the amendment is being done now but I will have to pay difference now £88 pound she took it on card payment said new details will be emailed to day 10 mins after taking payment email comes ignore the price we sent it is now £470 more after paying them I phoned them back after an hour of phoning got customers service said why have you taken £88 what for she was clueless and was very un help full and ended up hanging phone up very rude I think this firm is a disgrace and will never book a trip again
"DEfinately avoid Love Holidays ! We booked and bungalow in a 3 star complex in Fuventura and ended up in 2 star in a appartment in town that we would never had looked at !! GIven no reason as to why - we are trying to claim compensation , wish us luck !!!!"
Love Holidays are only an agent. They don't book accommodation direct. Did the confirmation on behalf of their supplier have the correct details on it?
leyland you a laove holidays lawyer ? or representative i am just curious
"A simple exercise of checking on the profile and looking at the threads in which they have posted would tell you that they have thousands of posts in several forums over more than ten years and, so far back as I cared to waste time to look, only one relating to Love. So, you're not curious or you would have done that. That's the height of rudeness to imply that someone is a shill for a travel site when there is not an iota of reason."
i have no problemits all good
Jani I don't think this is the first time you;ve implied that people are working for a company. Please stop.
I don't think I will ever get over this awful predicament I am involved in with LOVEHOLIDAYS.Com ( pretty unlikely as they do not seem to know what they are doing without charging you an outrageously hideous fee for doing it!! ) and if the stress of it all doesn't give me a nervous breakdown -I hope this site can make people of the possible nightmare they may be walking into!!. Sorry if this sounds totally vitriolic but they have the WORST customer service and the WORST attitude towards their customers I have ever come across in my life and I am in my mid sixties!
"Unfortunately, deedannd, this seems to be the way of things with some companies. I suspect it's because of the way things are now. Far too many people don't use the internet in a sensible way. They come across a cheap advertised price and jump straight in without doing any checking on the company involved.The worst companies know this only too well, and they realise that they will continue to get customers no matter how bad their service is. So they have no incentive at all to provide good service. Indeed, such is the competitive world of online booking sites, and so thin are the profit margins, that they can't afford to do any more than the bare minimum anyway, in most cases.My maxim is to think the worst. I assume that everyone is out to get me and rip me off until I'm convinced otherwise. I trust no one!Edited: 2 years ago "
"Booked a Holiday with LoveholidaysBooked a Holiday with Loveholidays, flight and accommodation to Tenerife, Leaving UK on 03/10/17 to be flying with Monarch, watching the news unfold early (very) Tuesday morning decided to book another flight with TUI, lucky enough got one with almost identical timings. Received an email from Loveholidays giving clear and precise update on Monarch situation, informed them had managed to get another flight, my refund for the original Monarch flight was processed by Loveholidays on 05/10/17 and back in my account 2 days later, brilliant brilliant service from Loveholidays."
"Do not book online..After losing our xmas break with Monarch we searched and booked same place through LH online as soon as we heard.. It was more expensive but we new prices would increase. All booked. Deposit paid..I could have booked and confirmed flights/hotel direct for the same price as LH but decided to book in one place..What they didn't say was that when booking is completed online you then learn that it's not confirmed and you have to wait 48 hrs. Frustrating but we couldn't cancel,just waited.2 days later. Phoned,75 mins holding. Told to wait another 24 hrs.After 4 days no conformation or reply to emails..phoned customer services,65mins. Told we would receive email..Email later that day, holiday not available at price originally paid for..Told to phone through. Unable to get through,ring back didn't work..Holiday would now be another £600. WHY waste my time, ruin a xmas break , we now can't afford to go away ,no contact apart from today's email saying they had tried to ring and email but have now cancelled holiday.We are Totally disgusted with there total lack of customer care..They don't give a damn about customer satisfaction,just money..Why lead people on. A bit of honesty from the start would have gone a long way.."
">>>WHY waste my time, ruin a xmas break , we now can't afford to go away ,no contact apart from today's email saying they had tried to ring and email but have now cancelled holiday.<<<The simple answer is that it's unavoidable sometimes because that's the way that they and their business model works. You might hav ebeen fortunate and found that everything went smoothly, quickly, and with a minimum of fuss, but that can never be guaranteed with these online booking agents.It's partly why I never use them and prefer to arrange flights and hotels myself. They rely on people thinking it's easier and better to do everything in one go, and I;m sorry you;ve found out the hard way that it often isn't advantageous to do so."
Had I lovely holiday with Love Holiday to Croatia in October. Due to fly a week before Monarch went bust but I managed to find alternative flights and got a full refund from Love Holidays for the flight in just a matter of days. Personally I would happily use them again.
I must admit that I booked have booked a few package holidays with L.H and never had any problems.
"I'm sure that there will be lots of people in the same boat as you, Brightonwiz. Unfortunately, as I said in my last post, nothing can be guaranteed, so in my view it's all a bit of gamble using site slike this one. When people do have problems, they can be major issues which take a lot of time and effort to sort out.There's no way to ever be 100% sure that you won't encounter a problem, of course, no matter who you book with, but I do like tor educe the odds as much as I can. For me, that means going direct to the suppliers much as possible, because the more intermediaries there are, the more chances there are that problems will arise."
"Loveholidays has the worst customer service I have ever experienced, After making a complaint on my return, that I had to chase up as they did not respond for over a month, they said ""As you arealready aware, loveholidays acts as an agent only on behalf of your serviceprovider "" so basically any issue you have is not going to be their fault, Stay well away....."
"Good luck,they are total crap."
"Thanks I have never heard of the company, but I was thinking of booking a holiday for next year. Have changed my mind and will use a different company.."
"I booked into a hotel and have since found out that it is being used as a homeless shelter. I fully commend them for offering shelter however as I am paying good money I feel the need to be notified. When I put in a request to change a new hotel, the prices were increased and as Love Holidays did not book when I told them too the prices went up again. Who had to pay the additional costs?? Me....I've been told that unfortunately there's nothing that they can do to help. I'm very dissapointed and I feel that Love Holiday really couldn't care, they've got there money and that's all they care about......Book via someone else would be my advice...."
"Some hotels are indeed used to house people who are temporarily without somewhere to stay. I found myself in one such place years ago in Dover. It didn't affect my stay any more negatively than was the case with the hotel I once stayed at in Cork which was next door to a shelter for the homeless.The question I want to ask is how did you find this out, and how do you know that LH were aware of these arrangements?"
Basic questions: Did you get a room? Did the room reasonably match the description? Did the hotel's description match?
"Right now I am nervous after reading the thread. I booked hotel only with Love Holidays for January 2018 as their the prices were great. Almost too great. This should have set up some alarm bells as I am a seasoned traveler, but I have been under a lot of stress and did not have my brain with me. The sales guy was polite claimed he had stayed himself at the hotel.When I received my confirmation it says my booking is by You Travel, a third party supplier. I called the hotel and they had no trace of my booking, but I understand these ""hotel bed"" companies might only supply our names 1 week before arrival! Has anyone booked safely and managed to have a successful holiday where the hotel booking actually existed and where there?"
"Try not to be nervous, susie. EVen with the worst companies in the world more goes right than goes wrong. Unless a comopany is a scam or fraud site, and LH isn't that.But don't put yourself in the same position again in future. Check companies out before you give them any money. Every time. And avoid those that you would be worried about."
"After our experience this week I will never use or recommend this holiday company again. There was an isssue with our booking, all the ‘customer services’ agents were rude, defensive and condescending. They sought to belittle and blame the customer rather than solve the problem in any shape or form. A real case of we have your money Now and we don’t give a sh*t. A disgrace to the UK travel industry. We will be highlighting and reporting our experience to ABTA."
"Do come back and let us know how you get on, sheera. I'm also interested to know what your issue was."
"I am most nervous about LH being only an agent and having outsourced my booking to You Travel and LH having no responsibility at all. Hope they will be able to honor my booking. Let's see how it goes. 1 month to departure, I'll keep you all updated."
"A painful booking process. When originally booking the holiday the website glitched and booked for the wrong dates and from a different airport. The then have made us liable for cancellations fees, admins fees and to pay for the flights as well. Despite many emails saying we don't accept the charges they still took the money we thought we were paying for the actual holiday and put it towards the holiday that their website invented for us. Customer Service people seemed huffy and unrelenting on the phone, claiming that we hadn't confirmed the cancellation and basically forced the full payment on us."
"You made big mistake,"
"This company is the worth company to book with, they not reliable at all. They mug people by price promsing and price match, but they don't do it. It's the wroth company I ever dealt with it"
"I booked a short break in Lanzarote with Love Holidays. The apartment was foul smelling, in poor state of repair, and unhygienic with cracked and broken work surfaces trapping dirt and grime. Wardrobe doors missing and cupboard doors hanging off. I contacted love holidays at the time and they advised I seek alternative accommodation MYSELF, as it would be cheaper, should I look around the resort myself, YES. Send us e-mail photos please, But I don't have e-mail here, ah well not much we can do to help because the service providers will just dispute it. Poor poor service from Love holidays. I upgraded at a cost of 30 euros, I asked love holidays to re-imburse me, they sent me a voucher for 50 euros. I have to book another Love Holidays trip to get the benefit, I am not sure I want to do that given your poor customer care. Please can you send me 30 euros rather than a voucher? No reply. However they are at pains to point out that they are only a third party and go between for holidaymakers and providers of accommodation, so its not really their fault. BEWARE OF LOVE HOLIDAYS, if you have a problem, your are ON YOUR OWN OUT THERE."
"They are just a third party, philip. They aren't responsible for what the accommodation provides, or it's condition. I expect that the very most they could have done was to forward your complaint with supportng evidence. What did you want them to do?"
I may have been naive but as they were selling me a holiday I expected them to have some responsibility to provide accommodation that was fit for purpose. The room I was given was dreadful. I really did expect them to at least use their telephone to encourage someone to respond to my request to change rooms. It cost me 30 euros to change and I was content with the new room. I did hope that as a gesture they would reimburse me. I imagined they may be concerned about their reputation. I now know better and understand that they are no more than a go-between. In future I will ask what assistance they can give at the resort if there are problems. Love Holidays are unable to assist so its pot luck really. You live and learn :-)
"I don't think you have been naive. Perhaps inexperienced is a better word, and i mean that in a positive way because I'm only saying that you most probably have never had issues like these before, so you;d likely never had cause to try and sort them out.I've never rented an aprtment, so I;v eneve rhad problems with maintenance etc, but if I did, I'd be looking to try and get hold of a local owner or their rep to try and assist me. I don't know if that is the right approach to these things, or if I'd be successful, but I wouldn't expect an agent like LH to do much, if anything for me. If they did it would be a bonus!That said, I don't think it's an unreasonable expectation to think that LH might provide a bit of help in putting you in touch with someone local if you asked them."
"I have booked 3 holidays with LH and all have been perfect - everything was booked correctly - flights, apartments and transfers - have another holiday coming up in March also booked through LH - wouldn't use anybody else. I do always contact the hotel prior to travel to confirm my booking and have never had a problem"
"Booked several holidays with them. , never had a problem"
"I hope your luck continues to hold, geejay!"
"Hi -I am with you no problems ever , have booked several times . Maybe as most staff are self employed for cost cutting reasons ( ie working from home) it may be as simple as some are better by far than others ?? Cannot think of another reason - I shall certainly be booking more trips with Love Holidays . All the best !!"
I would never use this company again. Unreliable. The worse customer care. Impossible to get anyone on the phone once they have your money. Changed our hotel. Shabby alternative offered. Loveholidays = stress holidays.
"Please stop spamming the forums. One post is enough.They didn't change your hotel. They're only an agent. From reading one of your other posts it sounds like the hotel overbooked and you got bumped. It happens. All hotels overbook and if they don't get cancellations they bump people. It looks like your room type that they overbooked so they contacted Love Holidays supplier to inform them. They told Love Holidays and Love Holidays offered you an alternative. That's all the agent can do. Presumably they offered a refund for the accommodation if you didn't want to accept the change, or told you that you could pay any difference in cost if you wanted a different hotel?"
"I'm looking at booking a hotel in Hammamet, Tunisia through Love Holidays. My boyfriend has called the hotel directly and the price they quoted him is quite a bit more than what I'd pay booking with LH. Slightly suspicious but maybe it is just a good deal.I'm just wondering, if I do book with them (which I think I am going to), is it best to give the hotel a ring and check that they have my reservation confirmed?Thanks"
"#212They will be buying the room via a third party intermediary. Nothing wrong with this and a way to secure more advantage rooms rates, the intermediary being able to secure a lower rate because of volume of sales and likely a year round or full season presents.Certainly call the hotel, but I would only do so nearer to your arrival day. The hotel will quite possibly be unaware of your reservation until nearer the time with names released to them only 1-14 days before.Your hotel voucher will indicate the intermediary party (e.g. YouTravel, Hotelbeds, Medrooms).Edited: 2 years ago "
"THere is an upside to using companies like LH. That's mainly getting a slightly cheaper rate thna you would from booking directly or through the likes of Booking.com or Expedia.There are also downsides, though. One of which is having to deal with what amounts to a fourth party, which can cause problems if anything goes wrong. And, to my mind, there's more that can potentially go wrong.It's up to you if you consider the reward worth the risk. If you do choose to go through LH, then it's a good idea to check the hotel has your reservation, but due to having to go through more intermediaries, it may take some time for the booking to get to the hotel, as T_U has rightly said. Personally, I'd be prepared to pay more for the peace of mind, but like I say, it's your decision."
I have booked a holiday with you in march at the bugibah hotel Malta on the 18th of march and would like to know why I am paying fifty pounds for transfers when with other operators they are charging between five and fifteen pounds? I am paying nearly eighty pounds more for same holiday ? Many thanks Daphne
"That's a good question, Daphne, and I'd like to know the answer, should they ever give you one. I can't see you getting one from them here, I'm afraid."
"Also had a terrible experience with loveholidays.They charge £25 to cancel a reservation. Never in the decades of booking hotel reservations have i ever to pay to cancel, 6 months ahead.loveholidays also charge £75 to amend a booking. Ridiculous. Some kind of scam that will hopefully get shut down soon."
It's not a scam to make these kinds of charges. We all need to make sure we know about them in advance so that we can make an informed decision on whether to use the company or not.
Do you think agents and their suppliers work for nothing? News flash - they don't. Where bookings are amendable they charge £75 to amend plus any supplier charges. They charge £75 to cancel a booking plus supplier charges. Some bookings are 100% non refundable. No scam. All clearly written in the terms and conditions you agreed to. I'm guessing you never bothered to read them though.
Do not use this company under any circumstances. My wife made a mistake with the dates of our hotel and when we tried to amend them they refused. We lost over £700 terrible customer service and we will never use them again.

"well, my last post got deleted so i'll try and rephrase. @LeyLand10 - You need to chill. A forum is a place to express personal opinions, if you do not agree there is no need for that aggression."
Terrible company with zero customer service I was left out of pocket by over £700 when they would not switch the dates of a holiday booking despite repeated attempts to contact them.
has anyone used the transfer that love holidays use? ( Hotel Beds Slu Transfer Eur Uk)i am going to Antalya in turkey in june and getting picked up at 2am in morning so would like to know if they are reliable and can speak english?
Hotelbeds aren't actually a transfer provider. They're just one of the suppliers that agents use to book accommodation and transfers.
Tried to read this but got annoyed with your excessive USE OF CAPITALSEdited: 2 years ago 
"We arrived in Lanzarote and the private transfer we booked via love holidays failed to show up had to get taxi , love holidays so unhelpful and say won’t refund us as we didn’t get a receipt from taxi driver won’t ever use them again"
"In the event that any pre booked and pre paid element of your travel arrangements is not delivered (or doesn’t show up in your case), it would be wise to obtain a receipt for any new service that you have to buy. That way you have a chance to claim for a refund from the original supplier of your extra expenditure."
kelly did you ring the number on your transfer voucher to see where your transfer had got to? Whenever you buy anything that you are going to claim back you must always get a receipt to prove you actually bought what you're claiming for and how much it cost. I'm not aware of any company that will refund without proof of purchase. Love Holidays aren't going to refund you out of their own pocket. It wasn't their fault the transfer didn't appear. In order for them to claim the cost from the transfer provider they would need to some evidence of how much it cost.
"Dear all,I’d also like to share my experience with LoveHolidays, which has been the worst in terms of “customer service”.Before booking with them I checked the reviews online and was surprised about how many people complained about receiving a different room to the one they originally booked. Therefore, I was very cautious and asked the representative on the phone to confirm that we will definitely receive the room with a balcony that does exist on the hotel’s webpage. She explicitly stated that she can already see on the confirmation PDF that the room has a balcony. I was happy and booked the room.30 minutes afterwards I received the confirmation email with a standard room, excluding the balcony. I immediately called up LH again and stated the incident – they promised to have a look into that. This was 7 weeks ago. After one week they even admitted that this was their fault and promised to get this resolved with the sales team asap.In the meantime, I have sent an endless amount of emails and called them up many times but the answer is always “we appreciate your frustration, we chased the sales team again, I can’t do anything from my end”. I’m going on holiday in 5 days and haven’t received any response. It looks like I will have to pay for a hotel room that I could be offered since it exists on the hotel homepage but LH refuses to book this one and instead just leaves me with the standard room.They haven’t offered to book the correct room, any discount, any refund – just no response and “we can’t do anything about it”, despite the fact they admitted it was their fault. During the booking process they sounded lovely on the phone but afterwards they just refuse to be of any help.Any ideas on how to get this issue resolved? Strongly recommend to not book via this agency – pure luck to receive what you paid for!Many thanksEdited: 2 years ago "
"Sorry. You're not going to get it resolved. You just used an unnecessary Internet site to do the simple job of booking the the kind of hotel room you wanted and did it without any online investigation to see what were the chances of them getting it right. I would say that if you had booked with the hotel itself, this would not have happened, if in the unlikely event it did, it would be fixed. I assume because you're asking for resolution you haven't had your holiday yet. Love is done with you now that they have your money. Trying to cancel something like this, even when it is technically allowed, generally opens a huge can of worms and often results in loss of both the money AND the room. Are you familiar with the novel, Catch-22? In which one version of ""Catch-22"" is, ""They can do anything to you you can't stop them from doing."" I really thing that at this point the only hope is to approach the hotel on arrival with the best possible smiling attitude and explain what was done to you, that you know it's not their fault, and can they please accommodate you. The routine is, ""I was so looking forward to this trip and the view. Is there anything you we do."" Always ask what they can do. Don't tell them what they can do. Individual rooms usually aren't assigned until arrival. I have a feeling that they were paid only for the non-balcony room and that, if they have one left, they might let you pay the difference for one. That puts you out the difference twice, but you get the room. Or if they don't have one, they might be nice and at least do something for you. If you accept that it was LH's fault, in no way blame the hotel. They, too, would rather you had booked directly with them. So until they demonstrate otherwise, assume they're reasonably nice people and will do what they can for you. If it turns out they can do nothing, well you got your lesson in how not to book travel at a much lesser cost than many others."
"There's a coupl eof things you cna remember for the future, because I don't think you're going to get anywhere this time, sorry.Firstly, remember that it's the hotel, not any third party agent, that is responsible for allocating rooms. So, while an agent may tell you that, yes, tehy will book a certian of room for you, it's always going to be the case that a hotel may not have availability, especially if the agent does not have live pricing.Secondly, and very much linked to the above, is that agents will frequently tell you whatever they think you need to hear in order to make a reservation with them. They might be telling you the truth as far as they are concenred, or they might be telling an outright lie, it's difficult to kno for sure. But if the latter, proving it can be very difficult indeed."
"Worst holiday company I have ever booked with. None of their employees pick up email chains so you have to constantly repeat yourself or argue the same point with different representatives. If there is anything wrong with your booking, there will be heavy charges for any slight mistake & they will try to overcharge you in any way possible. They do not look at helping you in any way & I would describe this company as unprofessional & unhelpful. I also had to calculate the costs up myself as one representative charged me more than another from the same company! They cant even add up something in a calculator!"
"We are booked for a trip to Crete 14th to 21st May, we are going from Stansted and I think that I have downloaded all necessary printouts. The comments I have read here are rather troubling, I have tried to 'Manage my Booking' on the Loveholidays site but it will not accept either my name or the reference number I have been given, the phone line is unavailable. I was hoping to ask questions concerning public transport/trips etc. What should I do next?"
I fully agree . Booked holiday for wife's 60th.. Pathos no in resort rep.. site 15 euros taxi to Pathos 1000 ft up in hills no transport.. all in elusive food was dire.. cold bland potato or CABBAGE SOUP... all main meals.. rice chips n broccoli for 10 days.. No barman entertainment or guests. Compensation .. No way.. not our fault.. never complained in 20 yrs but these guys are cowboys.. Don't buy holidays from them
#234You would probably be better popping on to the Trip Advisor regional boards and asking any questions regarding public transportation and excursions on there. I’m sure that the local experts on the Crete board will have more information to share than anyone from LoveHolidays.com.
"#235/236LoveHolidays are an online travel agency. They do not have overseas representatives like you might find with TUI or Thomas Cook. I not believe they promise this service so not sure why you expected it.Sorry that your holiday was not as expected. I think you have found the importance of doing a lot of your own research before booking, especially if booking on the cheap with these separate component type holidays. A check on google maps will give you an idea of location and TA forums and reviews on the hotel and surround."
Terrible customer services - do not use this company
"Do not use them, awful customer services, dreadful service, would not use again"

"“when I said this to Love Holidays they said they cannot do anything about that! and complain to the hotel! they don't take responsibility with their mistakes or mis-selling of hotels!!”—-> The hotel write and provide the copy that is listed on the LoveHoliday.com website.“...even though Love Holidays is an on-line Travel Agency they should have resource available at the destinations they provide!!”—-> Travel agencies would not typically have overseas representatives. Certainly a cheap online travel provider won’t. Thomas Cook and TUI have resort representatives and the provision of these reps is included in your holiday price. Often contact of LH customers will be via the third party who provides the accommodation. If you had a representative from that business there, that’s a bonus. Most would just be phone contact.“its principle of providing service - not always about money or crabbing money! and when lodge a official complaint they come back with their non liability jargon”—-> No it is not a principle. It comes down to pure economics. No doubt you picked this trip with LoveHolidays.com because it was cheaper than booking with Thomas Cook and TUI. Well something needs to give. You didn’t pay for resort representatives and a personal service...and you shouldn’t expect to receive it. Buy cheap, get cheap."
"<<and the hotel includes amenities which should be all inclusive and when we got there you had pay for gym and sauna!>>An all inclusive hotel doesn't mean everything is free of charge. It's not unusual to have to pay for some things. Love Holidays list what is included and neither the gym or sauna are on that list.The photographs are the same as on other websites. An agent has no say whatsoever in whether or where a hotel lets people smoke, nor do they have resort reps."
"I am confused about what you expected LH to do, and in what way they have missold the accommodation. As stated, they have no control over the smoking policies of any hotel or resort, and it's naive to believe otherwise. I;m sorry to say that it's also naive to believe that All Inclusive means that everyhting is automnatically going to be included. The relaity is that AI is a very broad term and that within that description you'll find that some properties do include everything they offer on site, while others have a far more limited range of included dining/bar facilites and activities.As is so often the case, the devil is in the detail, and we have to read the descriptions of what is included very carefully rather than just making assumptions."
"Some of these comments have rather unnerved me so I have checked with my hotel that we are actually booked with them and have also logged into my flight company to make sure we are booked. All seems fine and the hotel have been very friendly and helpful. We have been advised to get an App.so that we can check in online for outward and return trips, this will avoid an extra charge. The only thing I have not checked is the airport parking but the documentation seems cosha. Fingers crossed for a good holiday!"
"It sounds to me as though you haven't got a great deal to worry about. You've done the right thing in checking with the hotel and airline, and I recommend that you continue you keep an eye on your bookings just in case."
"Thank you. Thing is i cannot remember how I was directed to this company in the first place, I have never used them before. I usually go Expedia or Trivago, I researched the hotel I wanted and found myself with Loveholidays??"
"Trivago is only a price comparison site and there are some very dodgy companies appear on their search results. Some make LoveHolidays look like a 5 star company! You're best to stear well clear of middlemen and book direct. Flights are always better booked direct but if it's a very complicated itinerary use a good full service agent, not an online one. If you can't book direct with the accommodation itself then go via booking.com. It's the next best alternative."
Maybe you did a Google search for the hotel and didn't notice that you had clicke don a third party? It can happen to anyone. I'm normally very vigilant but I do get caught out now and again and end up on a site I don't really want to be on.
"Thank you I will be extra careful in future. This sort of thing really spooks me out. Did Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam with Audley [tailor made], expensive but it all worked."
"I am having a similar terrible experience with Loveholidays. As soon as I booked changes needed to be made and they said I'd hear from someone within 72 hours I waited almost that time and cancelled I had a bad feeling and have never had to wait with any other Company. They're now insisting I pay the flights which are in terms and conditions as non refundable which I didn't tick. I cancelled , had to verify cancelling and have now received the changes to flights etc days after 72 hours. It seems there is a real lack of correspondence within the Company. I emailed back saying this holiday has already been cancelled. They are useless con merchants. They have my deposit and won't be getting a penny more, they've made numerous mistakes. I am pursuing it as a complaint now. I the same as yourself wish I'd never booked with them.I have booked the same holiday for cheaper I just wish I'd found the Company I'm now with first."
Jessica M - I think you have sadly open yourself to ongoing trouble. Don’t be surprised if they pursue you for the costs of your holiday.
"Jessica you have to accept the terms and conditions or you can't book. Whether you read them or not is up to you. ""By clicking the 'Book Now' button to confirm your booking, you are agreeing to our agency terms and conditions, and the Supplier Principal(s) terms and conditions.""Flights are 100% non refundable, and you agreed to that when you booked. They said 72 hrs but you didn't give them that time and chose to voluntarily cancel. Doing that renders you liable for cancellation charges. Sometimes it does take agents a while to get back to customers about changes because they have to wait for their suppliers. What mistakes did they make? You wanted to make changes and then you cancelled before they were made."
Love Holidays are very poor when it comes to customer service.They are happy to promise you everything and take your money but when you need support they are just not interested.Avoid this company at all costs.
I booked holiday with love holiday it was disastrous we didn't stay in the hotel. Airport and the hotel is 1 hour away. We end up booking another hotel near the tourist location and the airport. No public transport and no shuttle service so i dint understand how this is a package. This happen to me in Greece and for another friend had to £200 for shuttle service to get to the hotel from the airport. I would not use love holiday again and will suggest my family and friends not to use love holiday to book their holiday.
"“....so i dint understand how this is a package.”—-> It wasn’t. But they tell you that on the front page of their website when they say “We do not create or organise package holidays”What is offered and what you selected and booked was two or more travel services. You need to be very careful that you select the right hotel that suits your needs. An airport location hotel might be offered but if you want to be near the city centre, or one near a beach, then that is what you need to pick. Check the hotel website, TA and other points to research ahead of booking if the hotel offers the facilities that you require."
"T_U is correct on all counts. I'd just like to add that this demonstrates how important it is to read and understand what you are buying, your responsibilities and your rights."
Am also having an awful experience with love holidays. They are disgraceful. I booked a family holiday with my sisters family staying in the same hotel. They have changed my sisters hotel due to an overbooking. They gave us the run around for 8 weeks before saying they couldn’t change us to same hotel. It has put a real dampener on out holiday. I would never use them again. They take no responsibility for their mistakes and blame everything on the service providers.
"Ty for all your reviews , my husband has been looking at holidays through them ( I like to at least have heard of a company ) having read all your comments HE will be looking elsewhere lol"
"Be careful when booking with LoveHolidays in ireland, I was certain the price was given in Euros but after paying came in as Sterling! Don't be fooled by promises of cancellation, it will cost you £75 per person, yes this is in the T&Cs but lets be honest do we all read them or do we go by the impression given on the initial booking page. the same goes for any change to your booking, that bargain holiday ends up costing you a lot more. Not to mention the hours of fun spent trying to get someone on the phone just to tell you to do it all online yourself. Will never even look at this company again and have advised friends and family likewise."
"<yes this is in the T&Cs but lets be honest do we all read them or do we go by the impression given on the initial booking page.>Yes, I read them - because I don't want to risk finding something out later. And then posting here - which no one will read - to warn something to do what I neglected to do. Yes, I read the forum because it teaches me how to be careful about booking and how these 3rd party OTA's operate. I do BEFORE booking because I like to be warned and prepared BEFORE I book and hand over my money. Then the risk is on me. In short, one can learn a lot of things from T&C's."
You read it!
"I read them, too, and for the same reasons that bk has mentioned.I think you'll find that there's a direct correlation between reading the T&C's and complaining about nasty surprises that have cost money. Those that do the former tend not to have to do the latter."
U must have flight ref on ur booking Go to airline website and login with ref and ur surname U can book seat boarding pass and all Hope this work for u
"I agree their customer service is very bad.I booked a one bedroom apartment but was sent voucher for a studio. Could not do anything until I returned and the love holidays were not interested in the problem even though they were at fault. Also found muc cheaper deals elsewhere, so would not recommend them"
I had the misfortune to book a holiday with love holidays and I strongly advise you to check small print as when anything goes wrong only response from them is they are only a booking agent and as they did with me left me stranded in turkey as the hotel I booked through them did not have the eminities advertised and the hotel had not had said emenities for 3 yrs most of the advertised hotels are out dated on their website and don't look anything like they do on love holidays website
"I wish I'd read these reviews before booking a holiday with Love Holidays. I can assure you there is no love in the customer experience. I booked a room with a terrace on their website at a premium cost. When my documentation came through it said I was booked into a Standard room, which is much cheaper rate - I have been to hotel many times so know the dates and rooms. After 2 weeks and 5 phone calls they have still not resolved this, keep blaming the company they use. Not good enough, no ownership taken of my issue or any update unless I phone them.Raised a complaint and it will take 28 days to respond - 28 days to check a basic issue!!!! Really. I can only assume it will take up to 28 days because they have a backlog of complaints.Love Holidays will not survive with poor customer service like this as there are far better holiday firms providing much better customer experience."
"I expect it will take up to 28 days because they have to contact their supplier, and wait for them to reply back. It might be quicker, but then again it might not. That's the trouble with booking holidays where there are so many different links in the chain. LH can't take responsibility because it's most probably not theirs to take. It's probable that LH will continue to trade for the foreseeable future because people use them. They see what they think is a good price and jump in, seemingly without checking how it all works and reading the T&C's first. Too few people appear to think about things going wrong before they jump on what seems to be a good deal. As long as this continues, so will companies like LH, who aren't the only company to use this klind of business model."

"Don't use them. Their communication skills are limited to messages only which take 72hrs between each message. They supply mis-information regarding verbal contact (10 numbers not 11). If you need to make changes they tell you to Re-book, or call a number which is worse than Virgin media phone system as it all refers you back to using email. If you are lucky by any chance to get it to ring that's as far as it gets. They ask for information which has already been supplied and the grammar is somewhat basic."
"I booked with LoveHolidays, told their representative who was quite rude and couldn't be bothered that I would be arriving a day late, only to find that Laberna hotel received no such message. Luckily the hotel had a room, nice room but not a good view, free wi-fi but range is limited to lobby / reception. Don't go on the quad bikes, you'll get soaked with cold hose, bad experience and pushy for photographs.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Avoid Love Holidays. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Unprofessional / unhelpful / impossible to get a hold of / underhand / untrustworthy. If you fancy a holiday experience of stress, anxiety and grief - go for it. If not - AVOID."
"Just come back from benidorm we arrived 12.30 am there was no key so we went to all the nearby hotels no luck. We went to Bobby bar luckily they new where to get the key was and bless them took us the hotel marina thank god ,also the swimming pool didn't have sun beds ,but the apartment was nice"
Both my wife and I travelled to Rome on June 12th 2018 and stayed at the Adagio Aparthotel Vatican.We paid extra and opted for minibus transfer from the airport to our hotel. Unfortunately we were given very little and confusing information as to the arrangements for transfer to our hotel once at the airport. Eventually after working out what we needed to do we were met by a gentleman who asked us to wait at station 2 inside the airport for no longer than 15 mins. After 45 mins he re-appeared and showed us to a minibus to take us and about another 8 passengers to our hotel. From the time we set off to the time of arrival the driver (and I use that word loosely) was constantly using his mobile phone with no respect for the safety of us passengers or himself as he wasn’t even wearing a seat belt?. I have actual filmed proof of this on my mobile phone for at least 3 mins. I could see peoples faces on the bus as we braked hard a few times to avoid a crash.
"This is exactly why I prefer to organise my own travel and transfers, Alan. You never know how relaible anything arranged for you is going to be,m whereas if you use official taxi's and public transport, you should have no such concerns."
Yes Roj you are right and I will def think twice next time around.
"We wanted a quick getaway, somewhere within 4 hours of the UK and against our better judgement we went for a package deal, the be fair the holiday itself was good but being left stranded at the airport in Lanzarote because our transfer company was closed, kind of killed the mood. This in itself wasn’t too bad, although we had over paid for direct private transfer that we could have got cheaper if we had got a taxi, but the customer service is appalling! They want you to direct message them on FB then email them, then email another department and all the time just delaying you and slowly breaking you down. Will never ever use these again!"
"Similar experience to others regarding the Transfer company appointed by Love Holidays in Tenerife. Lady on transfer desk did not speak any English, i know we are in their country and my Spanish is non existent but a UK company should at least ensure the transfer company are able to communicate with UK travellers.Eventually a surly and rude guy turned up and confirmed our booking was an express transfer which meant we would have to wait a further 20 minutes. I ended up getting an airport taxi.Love holidays response was no existent for 2 days after complaining and that was from a Resort Rep who attitude was basically , Tough.Eventually got a reply from Customer Services 3 days after getting home from the holiday having again booked, via our hotel, a taxi back to the airport.My recommendation is give Love Holidays a wide berth."
"Yes this seems to be a common theme with LoveHolidays. Unfortunately their only concern is to make sure they have your money. A pity really because if they only understood and listened to the customer it would lead to Better Service, More Customers, More Profits! However, while they are making at least a little profit nothing will change! When they are losing money they have to provide a better service to survive!! Not really Rocket Science is it?A typical British company attitude to customer service..... Profit is all that matters.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I don't think it's particularly British, Alan. There are plenty of ropey companies out there who are based in other countries."
You have to check in online.. via manage my account and print your boarding passes off
Awful awful company got to be the worse holiday company advertising at the moment
Loveholidays.com is a fraudulent agent you have to stay away from.They will take your money for particular resort and before the holiday will try change it with something much worse.
"Please stay away from loveholidays.com, not reliable."
That's shocking it's a trap I booked but you don't get to select a flight that suits you for me I wanted a single room but gave me double when you pay deposit all change options come at a high cost . They don't answer the phone I went on web site later & all the room choices were there . After reading reviews I'm concerned about not getting checked in on time that would cause more costs I'm with Ryanair check in is 4 days before.Has anyone else had this problem
"I have just recently booked a hotel via love holidays, and honestly it's not that bad, they are good and have good deals going."
"I booked a holiday with Love Holidays yesterday morning and soon got a confirmation email. Within a few hours they had called me to tell me that the flights we had arranged were actually fully booked and that we had to cancel the holiday! They offered no alternative dates or flights for the same holiday but gave us 2 options instead; cancel the booking or use the money I had paid to get Love Holidays credit. Well I certainly wasn't going to be booking any further holidays with them after that! So I opted for the cancellation. Instead of them sorting out the mistake they had made on their end, they then told me to call my bank and cancel the transaction. Why have the option to book a flight if it is no longer available?! So I have now had to spend even more time looking for a new holiday and luckily have booked one with TUI - much more reliable. Will not be using Love Holidays again."
"I’ve just got back from a 10 day holiday in Crete in a 5 star hotel, half-board. At the time I booked I felt the price was reasonable however after seeing the hotel and our room it was clearly not 5 star quality. This disappointment was compounded by the fact that comparing what we paid to other holidaymakers we had paid up to 40% more than others who had booked all inclusive. To make things worse when I contacted Love Holidays they were very dismissive and wouldn’t entertain either upgrading us or providing a refund. The attitude was very much “thanks for the money, now get lost”. Despite this we tried to enjoy the rest of the holiday but it did leave a very sour taste in my mouth. On reflection I would never use this company again, they don’t appear to be a professional and trustworthy organisation and I would definitely not recommend them. To anyone about to use them be very careful and shop around because you could be paying through the nose."
"I have noticed on LoveHolidays.com and other similar sites that the hotel grading or rating can be rather dubious. Their operating set up allows for various holiday components to be cobbled together to create a holiday. You are not buying a true package holiday and your contract can often be direct with the hotel or supplier of the hotel room rather than with LoveHolidays.As hotels or third party bed banks are listing their own content, I suspect the ratings being used are more for marketing purposes rather than a true official tourist grading or the traditional grading that a “real” tour operator would use. You really have to do your own research, checking Trip Advisor reviews, doing other Google searches as well as generally looking at the hotel copy on the website. I find the images will often show if this is a true five-star hotel or just marketing fluff to push the hotel up the search rankings.Which hotel was it?"
Struggling to cancel a holiday . They don';t allow phone cancellations and the web site cancellation is unusable plus the fact there are a myriad of addresses for them when I attempt to do this by overland mail. They are harder to find than the Scarlet Pimpernel.
"Changes and cancellation requests can be made via a call to their customer services team - 01903 258 288.You then need to back up the cancellation in writing as per their terms -“All requests to cancel must be made in writing and re-confirmed once you have been advised of total cost to cancel.”I would have thought that when you call they would tell you the address to use. Simply ask. Or, google their main office address.When you think about it, isn’t it wise that they seek written confirmation of your cancellation rather than just accept a call from what could be anybody to cancel your holiday? I also expect that many change their mind about cancelling once they realise that not all monies paid will be returned.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Soooo angry with Love holidays!!!! Joke! This company are nothing more than a cheap broker for sloppy, cheating low budget holidays. Organising deals with sloppy third rate providers who, when they misbehave and con you out of your money are powerless to take any action. Not like a mainstream provider, as they are brokers, when the provider, who actually arrange the trip, stitch you up!Love holidays have no power to intervene with their third party providers... Full Stop!!! Don’t book with this lot! Stick to main brands like Thomas Cooke or TUI, who at least have some say in the sloppy actions of their providers, when they act badly. I booked hard rock and they swindled me out of nearly £1,000, as I upgraded to “rockstar” but when I arrived they tried to charge me again or forefeit. Love honey admitted the errror and then said they were powerless to act. Even after the event. My Quandry - pay an extra £1,000 at the desk or lose the £1,000 that I had already paid for the upgraded holiday??? Why? I lost out on my room, food, upgraded drinks package and VIP status (restricted areas) that I had paid for. I got no extra benefits on my hols, although I had paid the extra money for the privilege. The hard rock said pay again or you don’t get the upgrade. But I had paid £1,000 gbp already to love holidays. Where has that money gone? Who knows. All I know is that lovehoney admitted the error but were not able to address. Joke! On the basis of what I lost I could have booked through a mainstream provider a lot cheaper! So this is site is a joke, con and damn right bunch of thieves. I gave them 3 months to resolve. Slippery, dodgy company which I advise you to adviod. Would never use them again. Don’t bother complaining unless you like to be fobbed off with templates saying their sorry. They know that the staff at hard rock scammed me and they were powerless to assist. Useless protection, when it all goes wrong, Go to a known brand like Thomas Cooke, when things go wrong, with them, at least you know they’re (TC) are a well known and reputable brand not these monkies. Haven’t heard the last of me either."
#294/295/296 are duplicates of #293#293 -Do you recall from your accommodation voucher who the Supplier was?Did the name of the room category on the voucher match the room category description on the website when you booked?This could possibly be a problem with how the hotel Supplier has loaded the room type and how that was fed through to LoveHolidays.
thankyou to all who posted i wont be booking up with loveholidays after reading all the bad reviews
"I have read alot of reviews and discussion on TripAdvisor and all over the internet about loveholidays which were mostly very bad reviews but read the reviews here and were mostly good so i thought ill go ahead and book a holiday through loveholidays which i regret now using them so please be aware of their cancellation policy, making a change to ur booking or even make sure that they booked u the right hotel that u wanted. I booked for a group of 5 people , 2 british and 3 other nationalities to find out after few days when i called the hotel that the rate was shown is for british only and not for any other nationality and i will have to pay extra upon arrival to check in ( no body could tell me how much until we arrive at hotel which is awkward ) i phoned love holiday and i got told that its fine and as long as the lead passenger is british , my booking is confirmed and all good without paying any extra. I then phoned the hotel again to make sure we will not have any hassle at checking in but again the hotel said what loveholidays says is not true and booking for british is still valid and i will have to pay yet unknown extra price upon arrival. I then phoned loveholidays to tell them what hotel said, then finally loveholidays admitted it and said ya the rate they quoted me and i paid in full is for Brits only so i asked them to keep our room for us the 2 brits and cancel the other room of 3 non brits but then loveholidays said sure but they wanted to refund me the money minus 450 pounds !!!! What a bloody joke. Its not my fault and i did nothing wrong but trusted them and paid the price in full. They should take responsibility as im not a travel expert to know about different rates for different nationalities and its not mentioned any where on their websites. They take ur money first and treat u with their terms when u have no control."
"“It’s not my fault and I did nothing wrong”Completely disagree. You actually DID research the company, as so many other people fail to do, but then you still went ahead with the booking! That is what is most shocking about this tale. All the bad reviews didn’t stop you from booking. It’s weird because the two biggest pieces of advice here are: always do your research and always book direct. It’s failing to do these two things that get 90% of people in hot water. If all those bad reviews didn’t put you off from booking, then why should your bad review put off the next person on the fence?"
"#296Is it just a hotel you booked or hotel+flights? Just wondering if the £450 that they are not willing to refund is for the payment of the 3 x flight seats.Some hotels do restrict rates for certain nationalities but as you say it is not for you to know that. The ones that I have seen this most for are Turkey, Egypt and India when some hotels will not allow their own nationals to stay at the discounted U.K. rate. Which hotel and what nationality are your friends?If purely for the hotel, I would ask LH where exactly they stipulate that the bookings has to be for U.K. citizens only. If this was not clearly displayed prior to booking either under the hotel listing, or within their T&C’s , I think you have good reason to seek and obtain a full refund without deductions. A little more information from you first would help the TA community make suggestions for next steps.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I agree with Ben that you made a big mistake in not taking notice of the bad reviews that you read.Rather than mentioning cancellation, perhaps you would have been better to keep the room and insist that LH paid the extra charges to the hotel?"
"Disappointing - I'm not sure the room we booked with them was ever available! Our first time using Love Holidays and our hotel was cancelled due to overbooking. We have never suffered an overbooking before and we are frequent travellers.We spent a lot of time researching before choosing, booking and paying in full for our hotel almost 8 months before our date of travel. A month before we were due to go, they emailed to say our room was no longer available. They offered an alternative which was a hotel we didn't like at all, so they offered us to choose another on their site, up to a certain amount. Unfortunately, there were no hotels left available at that price or below it - they must have been aware of this before offering the option. They also offered to refund our money, which would have been fine if there had been other options at a similar price out there for us to find. At such a late stage though, we researched and found nothing available in the same price bracket. Love Holidays were keen to point out that they 'are only agents acting on behalf of other companies and our contract is not with them'. My point is that, if the money we paid for the room had been passed to the hotel when we paid it, there probably wouldn't have been an overbooking situation. In my view, either they or the 'other company' held onto the cash and the room was reallocated by the hotel. It did not completely ruin our holiday, but there were issues for us with the hotel we ended up with and so it was spoiled - a shame for those of us who save hard for our precious times away.It was a mistake on our part to use an agent. We will not use Love Holidays again - we will book direct as we usually do."
"Hotels can and do cancel rooms even if you book direct, Sue. There can be thing slike fires, water leaks, and other unexpected occurrences that are not at all common, but do happen.I do agree that by using certain booking methods there is an increased risk of a hotel reservation being cancelled. Some sites have direct links to hotels, others go through wholesalers and bed banks, becoming in effect, fourth parties. This is the riskiest option, but also provides a chance of a cheaper price. The danger is that hotels, having initially decided to sell some of their rooms more cheaply through these channels, then realise that demand is higher than they thought, so they cancel those bookings in order to sell the rooms at a higher rate.I htink that this is far more likely to be what happened than it having anything at all to do with payments. As such, avoiding LH won't achieve that much, as there are many other sites that work in exactly the same way. But your conclusion, to book direct, is absolutely correct."
"This Company needs investigating. Using their website I inadvertently booked for next year rather than the current year. Realised the error in the morning, cancelled the holiday and have now paid almost £700. The cancellation fee is not £75 but close to £100 because, apparently, the extra costs do not constitute Administration. Further, if the flights are confirmed prior to cancellation, you are stuck with them. Took minutes to get a holiday confirmation so I now have two plane tickets I can do nothing with. This cancellation cost more than the holiday I took last week. If you have to deal with customer services, they read from a script and will only refer to the script regardless of your complaint. I kept being told 'It can take 74 hours to confirm a holiday' several times so I am disadvantaged by the timely confirmation? Avoid this company at all costs!"
"You're right. The company doe sneed investigating. By every person that is thinkling of using them, and preferable before they hadn any money over."
Booked with loveholiday for a villa on Rhodes six adults and one child for 5/09/18 for seven nights got confirmation email for flight and accommodation when booking. but got slightly nervous when readings review's on here ask loveholiday for contact number of villa but told they only act as agent's. Did a little bit of research and found contact number of owner we rang owner to confirm our booking he took our contact details told us he would get back to us he rang us two day latter and told us he could confirm our booking. Sàt in terminal 1 departures Manchester on the fifth of September got email off loveholiday say accommodation had been overbooked and they were providing us with alternative accommodation. In SPAIN six adults and one child in meltdown rang villa owner from T1 he told us he knew nothing about this and was still expecting us rang loveholiday asked for explanation was the the accommodation provider had overbooked and they were organizing alternative accommodation in Spain when we told her we were going to Rhodes she put phone down.got to Rhodes had fantastic time. But will never use loveholiday again
"I agree totally, I will never use lovholidays again, very quick to take our money but then you have to go and make all the arrangements yourself, why? Might as well just book direct yourself and cut out the middle man. The only thing they seem to do well is take your payments on time.Edited: 1 year ago "
Don’t pay for the “express transfers” you end up waiting an hour for all the other passengers there is no Express part of it and you do not get dropped of first Also just looked at a holiday to sharm el sheik the cost of £248 looks great. They then offer a flight for £450 what they neglect to tell you is that this is only to Cairo. There is no onward fligh or transfer offered . How they expect you to travel the 500 kilometers to Sharm I have no idea
"I had quite a few problems with Love Holidays, some of which were probably partly my own fault but it certainly wound me up!They book you onto OK rentacar .This is way off Airport and if you need an early drop off there is a E50 extra charge. I queried the timings with Love Holidays and they said it would be fine! It is there in the small print but as I queried it it would have been nice to tell me!Also OK rentacar did the usual trick about how we would be much safer to pay an extra E114 for proper insurance so we paid £50 excess cover to Love Holidays plus all the rest. Not cheap at all!"
I think Sharm is currently not served by any British Airline as it is still off limits according to the home office.We are desperately hoping to get back to Sinai but are still waiting!You can go via Germany but it is a mission!
"Is it Ryanair? If so you have to do it all yourself and the later you leave it the worse are your seats!My email ended up in my Junk file, just check!"
"Used Love Holidays for the first time after a friend telling me about them. Will be using them again, even though they could make things a little more clear.We traveled to Grease, staid at Diana Palace Hotel.We upgraded the room with Love holidays at a great price. Regrettably if you upgrade direct with the hotel, you get the safe key and Air Conditioning free.As we upgraded with Love Holidays we had to pay 6€ a day for these. Not the end of the world but would of been nice to know.Would I use Love Holidays again. Yes"
Can someone recommend a good travel website to book holiday please without any hassle. Thanks in advance
"I booked hotel montelone through loveholidays, I was scared after reading all the reviews, a few points first, I found the hotel first after lots of research of where I wanted to stay, love holidays had the best price, again after lots of research. I made sure all details were correct, double triple checked before committing. Flights I booked separate with BA direct.Still, I had my doubts, my flight I knew was fine, but I only had my confirmation from love holidays regarding the hotel. At this point I had spoken to no one, all done online. I contacted loveholidays via twitter, they responded very quickly and told me I can contact the hotel at anytime if i needed to. I emailed the hotel who confirmed the booking, this was a great relief after all the negative reviews I'd read.So from start to finish it was easy to book, I made sure I'd done my research. I made sure all my details and dates were correct. I've just returned from a wonderful trip to New Orleans. I know there are plenty of negative reviews.I just wanted to share my positive experience."
Booked a holiday with this outfit. Was totally PO'd when it became evident that you have to book your own seats on Jet2 at £50 extra. We've been used to proper travel companies that do this sort of thing automatically. How low can you get?
"You must have last travelled when Noah was a boy.Many airlines, including Jet2, charge for advance seat assignments. Even if you booked with in-house Jet2 Holidays you would have only been given the option to be preseated if you paid a supplement and did the seat selection online yourself.Not a LoveHolidays issue."
"Went to Mauritius this year with Emirates, everything was paid for including transport to hotel by the travel company. Love holidays did not even tell us that we should have to book our own seats or, if they did,the it was well hidden."
"Bit of a difference flying Emirates to Mauritius vs. Jet 2 to a fly n' flop European destination. I expect you paid a little less for the LoveHolidays/Jet2 trip.FYI, even the base fares with Emirates do not include free advance seat selection.Expectations need to be measured against cost paid."
"Well the price per night is around £440 h/b ; much the same as the St. Geran which isn't exactly cheap. Not exactly sure how we arrived at Love Holidays. It was suddenly there when I was checking out the hotel! In my experience travel agents have always asked which seats we'd like and booked them for us with the price included in the holiday price. We shall not be using them again. Unfortunately none of the proper airlines fly to Tenerife from LBA so we're stuck with Jet2 which is an improvement on Ryan I suppose. Most times, I book holidays and flights myself as it's usually cheaper approaching hotels directly and using air miles where possible (hmmm)."
"It sounds to me as though you probably accidentally clicked on Love Holidays after searching for the hotel. Although you aren't happy with Love Holidays, if this is what happened you are lucky that you didn't end up on a site and with a company that was much worse!"
"There are worse? Unbelievable, I now intend to contact the hotel to ensure we've got what I paid for!"
"Yes, there are worse. Even if they are the reals cam sites that pop up occasionally, relieve a few people of their money and then disappear again."
"Hi - I have made several bookings with loveholidays recently. Details of flights, transfers and accommodation have been supplied with the original confirmation on each occasion, including vouchers for transfers and hotel which have this printed in top left corner. For your flight you need to go to whichever company with whom this has been booked, to 'Manage my booking'; there is a link provided with the original booking confirmation from loveholidays. Hope this helps."
I bet it does say in the T&C’s that every portion of the holiday is non-refundable. That’s how things work. That’s how you get cheaper prices. I think she was letting you off very easy by only having to pay 25 to cancel. She’s right- you should be charged the full amount. Someone does you a kindness and you complain! Unreal!
"I'm looking to book the Hilton Orlando for the 17th to 19th September this year. Loveholidays.ie have the best price by a significant difference.The majority of issue here seem to be regarding flights amendments and car hires etc etc. People missing obvious terms and conditions. In terms of them simply fulfilling a hotel booking, do we think they will satisfy that requirement and book our hotel room at the price given?"
"Hi,I have just had a bad experience with love holidays. I was processing the payment for my booking and my card got declined , I then entered the details again and it went through. When my confirmation came it was for the wrong dates! 17th Feb not 11th April , I went back online and my original dates were still in the search section. I couldn’t believe it! You can’t even fly out of the north if England direct to Rome next Sunday!I spoke to Love Holidays who say I put the dates into the search engine and they have proof and emailed me a set of internet page data?? They also said my card never got declined. I had a google as couldn’t sleep and found that this has happened to many people that during the refresh the date has defaulted to a different date!! Love Holidays said They bought the room of another company who say it’s non refundable, I have emailed ‘italcamel’ asking them if it can be altered, but I’m not holding out much hope. I also rang the hotel in Italy who didn’t even have my booking yet and said providers can alter it they would not mind, I have also rang my credit card company in the hope they may help, and they can see the transaction was declined and will process a complaint for me. But I have 3 nights paid for in a lovely hotel on the wrong dates! And still need to book the hotel ! I am trying not to go through a 3 party provider and check reviews first but lots of them are negative !!"
In a nutshell - NO. I booked a hotel only through Love Holidays and they didn't get that right. I had confirmation that the hotel was booked from then. I contacted the hotel direct - NO BOOKING. I much later received an email telling me that my chosen hotel was no longer available. DO NOT USE LOVE HOLIDAYS.
Love holidays would have done as you asked it would have been the supplier who didn't book the hotel. Love holidays would have sent you the confirmation that they themselves received. So looks like when you queried it the supplier told them it had messed up and now the hotel was full.
"I suspect you're right, and that this is yet another reason to avoid sites that go through fourth party suppliers. It only adds another layer of complication."
"Love holidays are conniving people and liers, dont tell them your complain straight away as they will look for an answer to back them self up. i booked a honeymoon holiday2 month in advance and 2 weeks before i emailed my holiday to see if i can arrange a transport from them, i immedietely got an email back from them to saying that their hotel has been closed down due to refurb since dec 2018 and wont open till 2019 some day. they also told me that my travel agent (Love holiday) should have told me about it and to contact them immeidietly, as i called and told my provider, they tried giving me a hotel saying it use to be a 4 star and now its a 5star..... what a full of crap cos it looked horrible and nothing compare to the one i booked which was much better, i gave them 3 options of hotels in which they declined and they gave me 3 options which i declined becuase it looks horrible and it was only 3 and 4 stars. it came to an end where they told me to take anything or they will cancel it and refund me everything which means i was under alot of pressure so i took whichever one i saw that looks the best. i confirmed it that is all inclusive with double bed n so on. as i got to the hotel at 10.20ish in the morning, our room wasnt ready and was told to come back at 12pm, they took our lugguage and dumped in near the toilet with other peoples lugguages., me and my wife ate and came back at 12 and then we was told to come back at 3pm because our room is not ready, love holiday before i booked it confirmed with me that everything will be ready by the time i get their. we asked them if we can have a room for 5mins so that my wife can change as we have a activity soon, they told my wife to go to the toilet and change, i called up love holiday immedieltly and complained and they could not do anything back, they took my complained and log it.6pm we came back from our 1st activity and our lugguage is still dumped near the toilet. we get our room key and off to the room, now as i entered i see 2 single bed and not a double bed as i was promised from love holiday, the bathroom itself was dirty and looked like broken or burnt like a ciggerett burnt. during the clean up by the room service, they didnt replace the towels, i came at night at 10.50pm from my second activity and told them i need 2 towels and they said they will send someone up to check....yes to check and not to send someone up with the towels. waited til 1am and no one had come, me and my wife fell asleep, i woke up in the morning and told them again that i requested a toewel and no one gave any, they said they will send some one to our room, now its 1pm and i asked them again, as i went up and i saw a cleaner in which i told them i need a towel now because i dont have it, he checked and gave it.now i came back to london and i logged on to my email as i didnt have any data package, i see a email from love holiday, without helping to telling me anything, they emailed me back saying that they cant do nothing and it was the hotels policy bla bla bla and that i can not make a complain and the case is closed. these love holiday is a right mug and a scam, they ruined my holiday and my hotel was worse then what i can imagine. no apology and too late for one now, AVOID booking through them liers, false promises and they will ruin your holiday just so that they can make their money."
"Love Holidays can't guarantee that a room will be ready at a certain time. That isn't even under the complete control of a hotel.Similarly, Love Holidays cannot guarantee a specific room configuration. Nor they can they do anything to override a hotel when it comes to such things. Whilst I am never going to use LH myself, as I consider them to be a poor option, some things are simply outside of their control."
Beware. I have had a serious issue with this company and involved ABTA. IT turns out they sold my holiday I booked through Loveholidays to a non ABTA registered travel firm. Therefore any serious breach and you are not protected.
They also sell your original booking to non ABTA travel forms. So good luck if the company go bust or you have a problem because you are not covered. I have an official response fromABTA to prove this. Very misleading and unacceptable. Use them at your peril.
"I booked a hotel in the middle of nowhere in Utah through LoveHolidays and paid up front in full. When we arrived, the hotel had no record of the booking and was completely full. Luckily, the only other hotel had a cancellation that afternoon, so we managed to get in there. If it wasn't for that, we would have had to spend the night in the car. Totally unacceptable.I contacted LoveHolidays about this and received a ticket number. That was over 10 days ago and they haven't contacted me once to tell me when I will get my refund.Never use this company. Your money and booking is at risk!!!"
"Love Holidays don't book with hotels, only with bedbanks. If you had a booking confirmation and accommodation voucher then your booking had been made by the bedbank. If that is the case then it sounds like a classic case of the hotel overbooking and bumping a bedbank booking in favour of a direct booker. It happens too often unfortunately. If you had no booking confirmation and voucher then you should have chased it up soon after booking."
"#332If you look at your hotel voucher it will likely tell you who the 3rd party intermediary was.I would however suspect, like Leyland10 suggests, the hotel could well be the guilty party and have oversold. Very easy to then blame the agent who is thousands of miles away.You should receive a refund from LoveHolidays although I suspect they will need some time to investigate what went wrong with your reservation."
"It's not that rare for hotels to try and blame a third party for their own actions. It is easier and cheaper for them to try and pass the buck rather than own up, take responsibility and pout things right."
"J'ai réservé sur leur site internet un hotel en Sardaigne Castelsardo Resort village pour 11 nuits du 11/8/2019 au 22/8/2019 pour 4 personnes avec chambre et petit déjeuner. Cette réservation a été faite en janvier et j'ai payé l'intégralité du séjour sans remboursement possible. Le 15 mai 2019 je reçois un mail m'indiquant ""que certains de nos clients ont confondus deux hotels réservés qui ont des noms similaires et sont proches l'un de l'autre "" Loveholidays en profite donc pour me dire que ma réservation est au Diffuso Castelsardo et non au Castelsardo resort village pour lequel j'ai effectué la reservation (photos de l'hotel, description de l'hotel, etc). ils me disent que compte tenu de ces erreurs clients ils me proposent un rabais de 30% pour bien me rendre au Diffuso Castelsardo. Or je n'ai jamais entendu parler de cet hotel et il n'y a aucune photo sur leur site concernant cet établissement.Loveholidays veut donc me changer d'hotel de force !!! J'ai appelé l'hotel Castelsardo resort hotel et là surprise ils n'ont aucune trace de ma réservation !!!! Si Loveholidays a fait une erreur ils doivent l'assumer !!!! De mon côté j'ai les billets d'avion et la voiture...Après 4 mails sans réponse et 1 coup de fil en Angleterre, ils me maintiennent leur offre de 30% de remiseInadmissible !!!! Je pars en procédure contre cet établissement qui bafoue les règles élémentaires du commerce avec ces tromperies et le non respect du contrat passé !!!Dernier volet de cette mésaventure, ne pouvant trouver de solution ni de solution de remplacement, Loveholidays a tout simplement annulé ma réservation et remboursé. Mes vacances sont fichues j'ai les vols et la voiture et à deux mois et demi du départ que très peu de choix et des prix exorbitants. Honteux et scandaleux !!! I booked on their website a hotel in Sardinia Castelsardo Resort village for 11 nights from 11/8/2019 to 22/8/2019 for 4 people with room and breakfast. This reservation was made in January and I paid the entire stay without refund. On May 15, 2019 I receive an email telling me ""that some of our customers have confused two hotels booked that have similar names and are close to one another"" Loveholidays takes this opportunity to tell me that my reservation is at Diffuso Castelsardo and not the Castelsardo resort village for which I made the reservation (photos of the hotel, description of the hotel, etc). they tell me that given these errors customers they offer me a discount of 30% to go well to the Diffuso Castelsardo. But I have never heard of this hotel and there is no photo on their website about this property.Loveholidays wants to change my hotel forcibly !!! I called the hotel Castelsardo Resort Hotel and there surprise they have no record of my reservation !!!! If Loveholidays made a mistake they must assume it !!!! On my side I have the plane tickets and the car ...After 4 unanswered emails and 1 phone call in England, they keep me their offer of 30% discountInadmissible !!!! I go to court against this establishment that violates the basic rules of trade with these deceptions and non-compliance with the contract!Last part of this mishap, unable to find a solution or alternative, Loveholidays has simply canceled my reservation and refunded. My holidays are ruined I have the flights and the car and at two and a half months of departure only very few choices and exorbitant prices. Shameful and scandalous !!!"
"Awful. Love Vacations confirmed and charged me for a room at the Four Seasons in London I booked on 17 April for a stay in July. I first became suspicious that something was awry when I tried to arrange an airport transfer in June and the reservations team could not locate my reservation, even after I sent them the details and reference numberI contacted the customer service number and was assured that the booking was in order. I asked for them to confirm with the hotel. Days passed and after no word a further 2 calls and still no email or call back (as promised) - the third call resulted in the company saying the 'hotel' had rejected the booking and there wasn't any 'space' - even though they didn't inform me and held on to the payment. I dread to think what would have happened if I turned up in London to find no place to stayI have now had to book another hotel, at a much higher rate and am still awaiting the refund to my credit card"
"Do you mean Love Holidays, or are you posting about a different company?"
"This company is engaged in what I can only call a scam. They sold me a holiday including a very nice hotel for just under £3000. 2 months later I am informed the accommodation is not available. On challenging them to ask why it has taken 2 months to let me know they say they have just found out: I e mail the hotel directly to check and find out that they were told there was no availability at the outset. Clearly they wait until departure date is close before telling anybody on the basis that it is then too late and customers are likely to opt for the alternative accommodation, rather than lose a holiday altogether. I was in this category, and I am offered something cheaper, I accept (foolishly) and am given a small refund amounting to nowhere near the difference in prices, they presumably pocket the difference as added profit. In other words their business model is: they sell a full priced but unavailable hotel, wait until close to departure then force a change in hotel at a lower price but they pocket most of the difference in price. I should have asked for a full refund, but did not and that is what they bank on. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY"
"Freddy,Sorry, but if you didn’t do any research about the company before booking with them, what makes you think anyone will take any notice of your warning not to use them....?There are 338 posts in this thread,( and dozens of other threads also on TA ) the vast majority of which are highly critical, and yet people still use Love Holidays ....obviously never having bothered to do even the most cursory or basic checks about who they are entrusting their money and their travel plans to..."
"As an aside, people are always very keen to believe whatever a hotel says to them. I'm not saying it's the case here, but there's always the possibility that a hotel is being economical with the truth."
"Of sure if I've just dodged a bullet twice or others have been very unlucky, but I've booked 4 times over the last 2 years with love holidays, and have had no problems at all.The offer an easy way to pay it up not needing last payment until 2 weeks before departure.But as I said I've never had a problem, maybe that's the issue, if their is a problem your screwed from what folk are saying on here.This year we are booking up for February and are puting the money away every month then book Dec/Jan and hoping flights are still available, and book last minute,so probs won't use love holidays.But as I've said we had no issues the last few times we used them."
"If you want to go on a holiday and stay in a hotel that you have chosen - DO NOT USE LOVE HOLIDAYS. You have been warned. No matter what your confirmation says, it is highly likely that a few weeks before you depart, your chosen hotel will be unavailable and you will be placed in an inferior substitute. . Free yourself from any stress and disappointment. LOVE HOLIDAYS = UNTRUSTWORTHY, FAKE, NON EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, LIARS."
We were very worried about booking our Orlando holiday accommodation with Love Holidays because of all the bad reviews. We decided the price was so competitive that we would give it a go and delighted we did. Easy to book and manage your booking. No problems with booking at hotel when we arrived. Definitely would look at Love Holidays first before any other travel agent.
"You rolled the dice and you won. To be fair, I think the odds were in your favour, but be prepared for things not go so well if you use them again."
"Need two tickets , anyone please let me know"
"What sort of tickets do you want, Jessica? I assume it's not raffle tickets (but if it is I do happen to have some for a meat draw later this week!)"
"Jessica seems to not know how to use TA forums and seems to think it's some sort of travel agency from the wording of her questions. The brevity of them prevents anybody from offering real help, as well.SWT"
I booked a trip to tialy with loveholidays . not good very little or no communication and told a response would be dealt with it within 24 to 48 hrs a week later after been and gone on holiday not one response so for that reason i would never use this company again . on the morning of flight there was no confirmation of email from accommodation i had to ring italy myself and confirm this and was told by hotel there was no reservation in our name.
I had the same issue in fact morning of departure no confirmation email for accommodation despite ringing and emailing them I was assured it would be sorted . I had to ring Italy myself and sort the problem im home over a week now and loveholidays have not contacted me. shambles of a company never again.
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVERFor a business trip i made a booking through Love Holidays and aftermore than 8 hours spent on the phone and live chat, the hotel still did not receive the booking confirmation from them. They were passing the phone calls on hold and saying we will be contacted back. At the end of the day they said it was an error and they will provide us with an relocation, we waited for hours, a proposal that never came. In the end we had to cancel our entire trip that was for business not for vacation in the night we were supposed to leave. DO NOT TRUST IT'S A TOTAL SCAM"
I just called the hotel they booked and there is NO RESERVATION for me. I was supposed to be able to cancel until December 26 FREE but now they are charging a cancellation fee. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!!SCAMMERS
“I just called the hotel they booked and there is NO RESERVATION for me. I was supposed to be able to cancel until December 26 FREE but now they are charging a cancellation fee. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!!SCAMMERS”—> Calm down.—> You are clearly travelling sometime in the future. Given their business model of using intermediary suppliers there is every chance the hotel not yet having your name as being quite possible. This does not make them “Scammers”.—> Revisit what you booked and the terms you agreed to. If it is clear that it is 100% free cancellation then you will get your money back. If however within the terms there is a service fee to pay net of the hotel booking repayment then that is what you have to swallow given that it is within the terms agreed and you have engaged their services.
"Their business model means that it will often be the case that a hotel won;t get your name and other details until shortly before the date of the stay. As T_U has said, it's how it works.I wouldn't even think of cancelling at this point,m but if you are please follow the good advice from T_U."
Interesting Trip Advisor didn’t enter all of my complaint. The rest was: i had until Dec 26 to cancel. So I tried and the response on the site was no refund when canceling with 26 days. Its two months away that Im going!
Thanks but that kind of “stand by” booking isn’t for me. I wasn’t aware that’s how they operate.
“Interesting Trip Advisor didn’t enter all of my complaint.” Not sure what you mean by that Twyla?Tripadvisor staff don’t hang around or moderate these travel forums. Whatever you typed gets posted on the forum when you click on the “Post your Reply” button.
Its not a standby booking the booking will exists but probably under the name of a company who will supply individuals details nearer the time.
"A really bad supplierA really bad supplier, made us wait for more than four hours for a booking that we made in Egypt hurghada. Saying that they contacted the supplier but they haven't. We're are supposed to check but they wasted our time and money with making calls to them several times with no result and we still waiting. I would really avoid using it again. Very poor customer service"
"Used Onthebeach,similar set up....they just put a flight and hotel together...in the UK you do get ATOL protection,or similar by booking like that....but to be honest I've looked at this company...and because they just blindly put together the packages they never consider things like airport transfer availability...try landing at Barcelona at midnight...then going right up the coast past Tossa....and getting a cheap transfer?....You'll end up with a taxi that can cost over £200+....and that's before customer service issues et al...Use them for ideas....then book flights direct...compare off skyscanner....more choice,there are airlines Loveholidays will not include...book these direct...more choice and more control....always get a flight that will land early enough for you to get transport to the hotel.......and finally we did TUI to Tunisia in May...we had a package,great hotel,included transfers and Rep service etc...my friends booked with Loveholidays...they paid more,for less...and no transfers........"
"You choose the package and then you can choose to change your flight to any flight that is listed. If the customer chooses one that arrives at midnight that is up to them. You can add transfers to your booking if you choose. Do you really expect an agent to restrict the flights they offer based on arrival times? If you choose one of those then it's up to you. Some airlines just do not have arrivals at ""sociable"" hours, or won't have them on the dates you want.Personally I wouldn't touch them, or OTB, TR, AR etc etc because I'd rather book direct, but it's wrong to say they blindly put packages together."
"#361'Personally I wouldn't touch them, or OTB, TR, AR etc etc because I'd rather book direct, but it's wrong to say they blindly put packages together.'Compared to traditional operators like TUI they most certainly do....have they inspected the hotels?...Have they checked if economical transfers exist?...I've even seen hotels advertised that have restricted reception/check-in hours....ones that will not necessarily work easily with your flights...many of their options are obvious if you look closely...I would expect them to at least put warnings on those that they cannot guarantee transfers easily available for...people could easily assume more research has been done,and so blindly book.Yes you can play around with flights...some will work ok,others could add a small fortune to existing prices quoted!...But yes,I would also book direct...I've done a few OTB..they did seem to have a better idea."
"The difference, at least to me is that outfits like OTB don't put packages together at all. The consumer does that themselves and that is what OTB facilitates. The likes of TUI make the packages up for the consumer.I arrange my own trips. I don't use OTB or TUI, but I think that a lot of people out there assume that things are the same. That OTB will do more for them than is the reality."
"<< have they inspected the hotels? >>Of course not. Does any travel agent? It's just completely unrealistic to expect that to happen. Do the high street agents check the hotels they book people into? If you book a DP through a TUI store, or an indy high street agent those hotels haven't been checked by them. << .Have they checked if economical transfers exist?.. >>That isn't up to them. Have you seen some of the arrivals time the airlines TUI use arrive? You can book transfers with LH when you book your flights and accommodation. If you want to arrange your own it's up to you to do some research and pick your flights accordingly. The same applies to a TUI package if you don't want to take their transfer coach. Plenty of people miss the tour ops transfer in favour of a private one they book independently."
"#364My point about TUI is that they sell package holidays,and they have a Rep available in the hotel,they have fully inspected it,they turn up at the airport and pick you up...they drop you back there...etc...when you search on the Loveholidays/OTB sites etc,it will come up with normally the cheapest combo of flight and hotel together...it will not have factored in transfers,hotel reception policies etc....yes of course you can then put your brain into gear....check flight arrivals,hotel check-in etc....availability of transfers etc...and cost of above mentioned.......I am not disagreeing with your points....they are valid...my point simply is will many people understand the difference between a conventional package holiday...and one that is simply pairing available flights with available hotels?....Looking at many on this forum who do not understand how things work I would have my doubts."
"#3Good morning Roj...You echo my own points exactly...There is a huge gap between the old style package holiday and LH/OTB who just throw bits together....in fact BA holiday finder is actually worse....economic transfers often do not exist,and sometimes the flight can go into a different country,making a taxi impossible....but how many will book,then discover this too late?"

"Morning Tim! I think you have a point. I do believe that companies like First Choice, TUI etc have at least taken a look at the accommodation and it's facilities, and that they have specific contracts with hotels.I think that too many people expect a site like OTB to work in the same way, which is why they complain to them when the hotel doesn't meet their expectations. Then they get annoyed when OTB won't do anything.I don't reckon that TUI etc carry out daily inspections of the hotels that they use, but having contracts with the accommodation means that they do have some power to insist that standards are maintained.Maybe the main difference is between a traditional package holiday and piecemeal arrangements or flight plus hotel plus transfer. I didn't really get how things worked until I joined TA. And I still think LeyLand knows a lot more about this sort of thing than I do."
"#368TUI and the like will have reasonable influence with their hotels,they dealt very well with a complaint I made in Marrakesh this year...they will have them checked out....then rate them etc...not daily of course......OTB at least do a bit of research...their hotels are actually tourist places,in the geographical location of the tourist areas they list...my last post proves that LH cannot even do that........and yes I'm sure our honourable fellow poster LeyLand knows his stuff...we're just looking at it from different angles.I did/do a lot of packages to North Africa,always at bargain prices,and TC/TUI were always far better than friends who did LH and the like...but then I got a lot of practice in finding and booking them....Now TC are gone prices are up,so who knows?....I'm looking at December/January now for my next one...if the prices come down to the level I'm prepared to pay.Off to Heathrow soon,look forward to speaking again."
"Never before in 30 years of holidaying abroad have I come across such an ABYSMAL Travel Agent. Their staff DO NOT LISTEN to customer requests, are DISINTERESTED and UNHELPFUL. Having booked for, and paid for the majority of my holiday, when there was an issue, I spoke with them to look for alternatives, which they said they were going to do, however they FAILED to listen, FAILED to help and took the easy route just to cancel my holiday booking WITHOUT ANY PRIOR COMMUNICATION. No professionalism or customer care whatsoever. I will NEVER use this company again"
"What a worst company to deal with, A small amendment taking ages to confirm, no email of contact since taking the money which is non-refundable btw. Rude people at customer services if you ask them why is it taking so long, they wound just hang up"
"hi booked hol for march through love holidays ,i got a confirmation booking with flights and hotel..nearer the time will i receive boarding passes?"
"You won't receive a boarding passes until you check in online. Depending on the airline that you've chosen to fly with that may be as late as 24 hrs prior to departure. Checking in is your responsibility.Edited: 8:38 am, December 11, 2019 "
"I recently booked a holidays for my Son and his partner to travel on Norwegien Airlines via Love Holiday, I had made changes via the Manage my Booking portal. I printed off the travel documents which showed the correct names. On arrival at the Airport the previous name was on the Airline system, the airline would not make the changes. Love Holidays spent 1.5 hours asking for £150.00 to make the changes and finally admitted that only the airline could make the changes.After 1hr 45 minutes My Son had to leave his partner as no one would make the changes necessary for her to travel.The team at Norwegien Airlines said they had experienced this before with Love Holidays. I would not book with Love Holidays again, they and Norwegien are a fatal combination, of poor customer care and failure to acknowledge when their systems do not work. If the Manage Your Booking does not communicate with the Airline then an email that can get into the trash is not good enough to communicate.Love Holiday could do so much better, Acknowledge the value of holidays, financially and emotionally.Very DisappointedE London Oct 2019"
"#374With what you wanted to do, a call to them would have been better.According to the Loveholidays website, using MMB allows you to communicate a change REQUEST to them. It sounds like you did this but their response went into your junk mail folder and was overlooked. If you did not respond then the name change with Norwegian (which would have come with a charge if it had been possible at all) would have been due.Loveholidays -“If you wish to make an amendment to your booking please click here to submit your request through 'Manage My Booking'. Please note that any changes to an element of your confirmed booking(s) will incur charges as stated above even if this is for example one letter in a name. Amendments can only be accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Service Provider(s) of your Travel Service(s). The Service Provider may charge amendment charges which may be as much as 100% of the cost of the Travel Service and will normally increase closer to the date of departure. Whilst we will try to assist, we cannot guarantee that such requests to make changes can or will be met.”"
"How this shonky got so big just proves how trusting and how little research people do!But to be fair any changes to budget airlines will cost a lot,even sometimes the cost of a new ticket.There is no real saving using LH,you can search easier and better yourself...both flights and hotels...and easily put your own combo,with full control in place to make a better holiday..."
"it got so big because in the vast majority of cases it works perfectly well it had 1.23 millions passengers last year so must be doing something right. In the majority of complaints it tends to be the person doing the booking that has no idea what the terms are. The complaint above someone thinks tha by changing your name on the website would somehow miraculous also mean the airline changed it to. You also get a monthly payment option and full package holiday protection if you book a flight and a hotel in one transaction. i have used them successfully even changing my hotel in the last days before going had no problems ever.Edited: 3:59 pm, January 06, 2020 "
"Good to hear a positive view and experience Robert V.As you say Love Holidays carries thousands of customers on holidays each year. I expect most of these customers have positive experiences but of course very few post those positive views on internet forums. Only the negative issues are reported, and as you say often self inflicted issues.LoveHolidays is actually now the U.K.’s 4th largest ATOL licence holder - that makes it larger in protected holiday purchases than British Airways Holidays, Expedia and Virgin Holidays."
"I will never use this company again. We booked to go to New York,as a Christmas present for my daughter who we flew in from Michigan. As my wife has severe mobility issues, we booked taxi transfer from JFK to Times Square and back. We had confirmation texts of these bookings. On arrival at JFK at 01.30 UK time-no taxi! We waited an hour with my wife in pain, and then paid for a taxi. Our daughter was worried sick, . On the way back, again we had a text to confirm taxi transfer, but planned too late to make the flight. All this has been reported to Love Holiday, but we keep getting nowhere. We do not love thise Holidays! Can anybody help?"
We call air line to book seats ect
Terrible company. We paid £1400 for a hotel in New York which was disgusting. The were also rude to us while there when we complained to Love Holidays they practically told me it was our fault.
Has anyone travelled recently with Love Holidays? Did everything went well?
"I booked a trip to Budapest on the 21st January £105 pp including breakfast, this was all confirmed. I received an email a few days later confirming changes to my booking. I have not made any changes. They have changed my booking to room only and increased the price. The chap I spoke to said I had done this on my portal. I protested that I most certainly did not make this change. Why would I change from b&b to room only with an increase in price. I spoke to another agent who said they would investigate. I've had an email back saying they can change my board back but this will cost me an extra £98. The holiday was actually still being advertised and at a lower price of £102. I'm wanting to make a complaint but cannot find how to do this. I've told them i'm not willing to pay the extra. I still have the original confirmation showing b&b. I'm totally disgusted that through no fault of mine i'm being penalised."
"I would contact my card provider, tell them what happened and ask them to help me get my money back."
"Love holidays are a terrible company. We as a family booked and fully paid for 7 rooms in the Mercure Hotel Princes Street Edinburgh 2 nights 30/31 December 2019. The hotel over looks Edinburgh Castle.We had hotel vouchers issued and were looking forward to our stay over The new year.They phoned and cancelled every room saying they did not have the rooms we booked and paid for in hand.We went direct to the same hotel over the same dates but had to pay a lot more. Worst company everEdited: 2:04 pm, January 28, 2020 "
"#385'They phoned and cancelled every room saying they did not have the rooms we booked and paid for in hand.We went direct to the same hotel over the same dates but had to pay a lot more. Worst company ever'You have been played for a fool....Love holidays did not cancel....the hotel did,knowing they would get more for the rooms elsewhere."
"I strongly suspect you are right, tim. This always seems to happen at very popular times, and Edinburgh at Hogmanay must surely count as that."
"Cant speak to them, cant live chat, went to cancel holiday as they said they could not confirm after sending confirmation email for deposit of £98. The cancel area only give reasons that are my fault not theirs. still waiting for any reply or refund, will never book with them again absolutely a scam company, disgusting service and web site."
How can I ger in contact with this Company - was holding for more than an hour today to discuss a hotel booking which hotel say does not exist. I only booked with Love Holidays because on the payment page it states : Free hotel amendmentsWe understand that sometimes you need to make changes to your hotel booking. At loveholidays we want to give you maximum flexibility and great value so we will not charge you an admin fee to make any change to your accommodation. Changes can be made up to 5 days before departure. I tried to change the booking on MMB and it wont let me. I tried the On-line chat but was waiting for more than 30 minutes for an operator and couldnt spend any more time trying to contact them. Only line that is answered is new bookings but they cant help or put me through to anyone. I have contacted my credit card company to dispute payment and they suggest emailing Love Holidays to advise them of my action. - does anyone have an email address for them ?
"Gillian,Others have previously reported that post-sales contact with Love Holidays can sometimes be troublesome and frustrating with long call hold times. Adding to that at the moment is probably the fact that as well as generally being a peak booking time for holidays they probably have lots more people trying to contact them with concerns and requests to revise travel plans following the corona virus issue. None of this of course helps you.The fact that you are unable to make the change online yourself may possibly mean that your current accommodation has some type of restriction. Not all may fall under the free hotel amendment scheme you highlight. It might be worth rechecking your confirmation paperwork to see.Regarding contact, email I suspect won’t help. Their website does not seem to promote this form of contact and would likely be the slowest response anyway. Easy for emails to sit in a large inbox. I think you will need to persist with the telephone. Try calling first thing in the morning when lines open.https:/…contact-us.html"
"Gillian the hotel booking will exist, it's just they don't have it in your name. When Love Holidays book accommodation it's done by one of their suppliers (bedbanks). Those bedbanks don't usually sent their manifest to the hotels until a maximum of 14 days prior, sometimes it's less than a week. They won't have individual names until then, the rooms are just held off under the one name."
"I agree with T_U and LeyLand. There will be a booking for you somewhere, but it has probably not reached the hotel yet.The ability to make changes might be restricted under the T&C's of this particular booking, or the facility to make changes may be temporarily suspended, maybe due to the coronavirus situation as T_U has suggested.I don't know what has happened, but these are definitely some of the possibilities."
"Have tried to get through but it seems that once you have made a booking, they really arent interested in speaking with you. I have checked the booking confirmation paperwork and it is a bit vague - doesnt say non-refundable and booking voucher is through Hotel Beds slu and not Love Holidays. Number for Hotel Beds, although a Spanish Company, is a Dutch number and the line is no longer in use. What I cant understand is that if they say the booking is fully changeable upto 5 days before travel before I pay the deposit, how can they change the conditions once I have paid a deposit. I have only paid a deposit so far but when I try to cancel they want to take the full amount for the whole stay in total over £1000 - booking is more than 6 months away."
"Hotelbeds will be the third party supplier of the hotel room. The intermediary between Love Holidays and the hotel. They are a B2B operation and you will be unable to interact with them about your reservation.I don’t think that anyone has suggested LV changing the booking conditions post booking, just that it might be that your particular hotel or room/rate type does not permit this. I don’t know this for sure but just offering up a possibility as to why the option to amend is not available. Hotelbeds may have a guarantee room block or you booked a discounted non-refundable rate category, these might therefore have change restrictions on them. Whilst LH do offer and advertise this flexible option I don’t think it has ever been advertised as valid for all bookings.Which hotel is this for and what room type and rate category did you select and book?I would also continue holding for LH on the phone as ultimately only they can answer your question and provide the solution."
"You have a hotel voucher so hotelbeds have made the booking. If for some obscure reason it turns out there is no booking it's because the hotel hasn't done their bit.Hotel beds are a huge bedbank used widely in the trade globally. They are trade only and won't deal with the public, even if you have a booking that's gone through them. Once you involve an agent to book through everything has to go via them. That is just one of the downsides to using a middleman or men. LoveHolidays employ a lot of homeworkers, which is quite common these days. As with all agents some are better than others. I understand that you want to amend this booking but if you involve your card provider it presumably is for a refund. Unless they actually charge you 100% of the full cost you're trying to get something you're not entitled to. Have you been ringing 01903 258288? If they won't/can't deal with your problem, I would try a private/direct message on Facebook and Twitter. If still no luck then I would write to them at their postal address, and send it recorded delivery."
I have only paid a deposit on the rooms which I want to cancel or change to another hotel in a different location which is what I understood that I could do or I wouldnt have booked with them. The hotel is in Disney World Florida . When I try to cancel on line they want to charge the full amount for the whole stay and not just keep the deposit. I involved my card company to block any future payments being made to this company which I consider has not sold me what I purchased - I bought a product that could be changed per their pre-booking terms and now they wont let me change it (only cancel with them taking full payment).. I would be happy to change to another hotel at another time or just cancel the booking and never deal with Love Holidays again. They say they will cancel the booking if payment is not received - has anyone not paid and had a booking cancelled that way?
"Again, not all hotels, not all room and rate categories, have this flexible amendment option. Which hotel and room category in Walt Disney World?If you cancel your credit card and disable future payments you are just risking losing any money paid to date- plus if you took up a low deposit offer, being chased for any balance due."
"Guessing, I have picked the Walt Disney World Swan & Dolphin.I picked a random date..https:/…Two options, one cheaper and marked as “Best Rate - Non-Refundable’ the other slightly more and marked ‘Free Amendment before xxxx date”.In this example if you selected the cheaper option it does not allow changes, it is a lower rate in return for you agreeing it being non-refundable.I am guessing that you picked the restrictive rate and that is why you are unable to change it.Edited: 12:12 pm, February 06, 2020 "
It is the All Star Sport and it clearly says that I can make free amendments before 6 August - I have a screen print of what I booked. I also checked with the new bookings line that I would be able to change it if my dates changed or if I couldnt travel and they confirmed that I could do so.
There was only one rate offered and that clearly stated that I could make free amendments. Has anyone else fallen foul to this promise only to find they cant change the dates ?
Thie hotel is still showing as being able to change upto 5 days before arrival -https:/…
You're not trying to amend though.<< but when I try to cancel they want to take the full amount for the whole stay in total over £1000 >>It isn't free cancellation.
It wont let me amend either - I would be happy to amend the booking to a European City hotel in October. Just changed jobs and cant take time off in August.. This was the reason I specifically checked this with a new sales agent before booking and was told I had until 5 days before departure to make any amendments so I felt confident in booking knowing that I could change it if unable to travel.
Is it flight+hotel or just hotel?Are you still trying to reach LH?
"Just hotel - I checked again on the email confirmation from Love Holidays which states ....use your booking reference to login to Manage My Booking where you can easily make payments, view all your travel documentation, make amendments and add extras..... All I wanted to do was to make a change but MMB wont let me. I am still trying to get through on the phone but no luck so far. I have managed to get hold of an email address - not sure if it is valid but anything is worth a try and it follows the same generic address as that of the CEO of Love Holdiays. I'l let you know how it goes."
I wonder if it is something to do with their Low Deposit scheme. Perhaps the MMB won't permit manual changes until the balance is fully paid on the reservation. Hope you can reach LH soon to clarify and resolve.
"I gave love holidays 5 stars yesterday as the booking process was very simple. I take it all back, been on the phone and internet since 9am today trying to contact customer services. In the end I called the airline who assured me they would get through to live holidays then get back to me. I wished the Lady Luck with that one. I think this explains how difficult it is to each them, the rep from the airline got back to me hours later to inform me there was no way she could get through to who I needed to talk to. I have had no reply to my email either. I strongly advise everyone reading the reviews to believe the worst ratings. Steer very clear of this company or you will regret it the minute you’ve handed over your money! There are plenty of good alternatives to go to. God help us if we have a problem while abroad, we will be alone."
Unfortunately many of these online businesses which draw customers in with lower pricing seem to be lacking in the post sale service element. I suspect focus is applied to new sales and revenue generating work with back office and non revenue work given little or no resource. Probably not helping at the moment will be many trying to contact them regarding the Coronavirus issue. I guess cheaper prices comes with cuts elsewhere.
"I'm confident that T_U is spot on in saying that companies like LH focus on revenue generation not after sales service. I also agree that the virus issue has made things even worse than they usually are.I don't know what issue you have but it might be one that can't be solved, even if you do get through to them."
"Attention à ce site très attractif.!!!Il vous en coutera bien plus cher que prévu !!Je viens de réserver un séjour d’1 semaine à New York à un prix attractif. (550 euros) Malheureusement arrivé sur place, l’hôtel me demande un supplément de 230 euros !! Selon eux, ce sont les taxes ... alors que sur ma confirmation de réservation d’hôtel, absolument rien n’est précisé !!Évidemment impossible d’annuler ma réservation et je ne vais pas dormir dans la rue... donc je sors ma carte bancaire.J’ai bien tenté de contacter loveholydays sur leur numéro d’urgence en cas de problème ... mais je suis tombé sur un interlocuteur en anglais qui m’a précisé que c’était normal, l’hôtel faisait payé les taxes qu’il voulait .... SUPER !!Je tire la leçon et je vais resté sur des sites de comparateurs D’hôtel bien plus fiable ..."
"This is an English language forum, sandrine b. You're very welcome to post here, but please post in English."
"We were due to fly to Tenerife with BA on February 9th and the flight was cancelled due to the weather. Hotel was booked with Love Holidays, we notified them immediately, and since then their customer service has been criminally negligent. The upshot is that finally today they told us we will not be refunded any of our money despite the hotel not having been paid (we checked). Do not use this booking agency, their behaviour is obstructive and dishonest."
"#412Did you book this as a package or a combination of holiday components booked together within 24hrs with Love Holidays? If so, if the flight did not operate, you should be covered for a full refund. Booking as a package gives certain protection under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018.If however you booked flights separately from the hotel with DIY type arrangements, unless you had a very flexible hotel booking, I fear all is lost. This is a draw back of not booking a protected package or linked travel arrangement holiday."
"<< they told us we will not be refunded any of our money despite the hotel not having been paid (we checked) >>How did you do that? Love Holidays don't book direct with hotels, nor do they pay them. Your post makes it sound like you booked flights, and then a hotel separately through Love Holidays. If that was the case then unless the hotel was refundable right up to the last minute you aren't due any refund. Your travel insurance may cover it if you had the correct cover. If you gave a bit more detail we would be able to offer more accurate advice."
"As promised, I have finally reached a resolution to my problem getting hold of LH customer service. After many failed attempts and because the next stage payment was due to be taken, I contacted my credit card supplier who advised me to dispute the charge which would either result in LH accepting the refund or prompt them to make contact with me. The latter was the case. The agent advised me that my booking was non changeable and non refundable unless I was able to provide evidence to the contrary. I sent her screenshots taken at each stage of my booking which clearly showed that it could be changed upto 5 days before arrival, as well as the hotel voucher which also confirmed the same conditions. I also pointed out that I was still able to book the same hotel for a low deposit of £10 with the ability to make changes if required. Within 24 hours, I received an email from LH acknowledging cancellation of my booking together with a Cancellation Invoice. Lesson learned from this is always to take screenshots of any bookings made on-line."
Thank you for returning to update your story and to explain how you managed to resolve the situation. Hopefully that may help others who discover this forum and thread. Glad you have everything sorted.
"Yes you are being smug..if you make a genuine mistake and notice immediately, you should he able to change without cost.. what I dont get is how one expects a holiday for 2 to cost the same as 1..."
"Luca, I'm not sure who you are replying to, all replies go to the bottom.""if you make a genuine mistake and notice immediately, you should he able to change without cost.."" That isn't how the real world works."
"Thanks for that bit of info I'm having massive difficulty with Love holidays too - they are not operating as a reputable company at all regarding my booking. I would like to warn others not to make the same mistake I did by booking a holiday with them I just don't know where to post it. They have acknowledged that I am due a refund (I too took screenshots of the messages) but despite admitting that they are refusing to refund me flights that have been cancelled. I am out of pockets over €1,600 and they are refusing to refund. I am going to contact my bank now so hopefully it will work for me as it did you. I quoted from my contract - their own T&C's which state I am legally entitled to a full refund, I showed them the airlines T&C's which say the same and the service providers contract stating the same and they acknowledged that it was indeed the case but in the same message told me that they would not be doing so. I also sent them a second paragraph from the contract which stated that they are insured against flight cancellation so that my booking was financially secure in all situations - now they are reneging on that! Seriously people need to be very careful and think long and hard before using these guys to book anything with as they are not a reputable company. They also cut me off from the live chats when I ask them a question and stopped speaking with me over the phone (now they have cut the phone line completely) they are a disgrace and they have no problem breaking their contract and not supporting customers when it suits them."
"Barbara, is this all linked to the worldwide coronavirus covid-19 pandemic?"
"Horrible service.... if you call them it says theyre available 9-5 but regardless of wht time you call there's no answer. Had booked 5 rooms and the next day after check in we get a notice from the hotel that only one room was paid. Luckily, the hotel decided not to try to charge us again and wait eventhough we were there for 7 days. Hotel was paid until the 5th day. Definitely will never use them again."
"I booked a holiday to go to Mexico and during the booking confirmation there was an issue on the website and the wrong dates were booked only from the 17 of December to the 22 of December 2020. My initial booking was from the 17 to the 27 of December, I raise the issue as soon as I got the confirmation voucher to change the dates and I only got a refusal to change dates or cancel the booking. I have sent a letter to their legal team to raise the issue and still not have received any feedback. So, in the end, I have a holiday booked only for 4 days from London to Mexico just a joke!!! Could anyone advise the best way to get the contract cancelled and my deposit back?"
"#422I am not sure you have grounds to push home demands for a full refund of your deposit. From what you describe (and trying to put this politely) this was a User Error. You made a mistake, quickly picked up on this and contacted them to enquire about changing. You need to work with them for the solution. I wouldn't suggest a heavy handed approach and not sure sending a letter to their legal team was the best initial action. Legally - have they done anything wrong?"
"Just to add that once you involve a company's legal team or department, then they will normally handle everything for that point onward instead of the customer service team.Depending on what you told them, they could be preparing for legal action."
Appalling customer service.Booked a holiday pre-COVID. Cancelled and offered a voucher. Declined voucher to request refund in line with legal rights under EU Regulation 261/2004. Communication only via impossible to reach message service. When finally reached unable to resolve anything and declined to discuss further when advised of passenger legal rights.I do not recommend this company.
"We already know, Gary. We've seen this thread for 4 years. Not sure how you missed it as you are a longtime member here.You need to reach out to your friends, the people like you who don't do any research before giving your money to sketchy companies and stop THEM from making the same mistake you made.Anyone who DOES do research will find this thread with 420 or 430 posts and quickly figure out to stay far away"
Love holidays are not a sketchy company they have a Atol licence for 1.6 million bookings they are the 4th biggest Atol holder ahead of many Stella names. They are owned by TUI the biggest travel agent in Europe and the number 1 ATOl licence owner 5.5 million passengers. Their profit increased by 57% 2018/2019 as they had close to a million passengers. Yes there maybe complaints on here but no more than most companies and compared to the customers that actually went home happy its not many at all. If you actually dig deep most are just people that didn't read the terms they agreed to when they bookedFor the record I have no relationship to this company what so ever or any other travel company
#427TUI do not own LoveHolidays.
"i do apologise I got that from a google search just checked again and it says this bizarre but i believe you are right  We are a trading division of TUI UK Limited, Company Number 02830117, having its Registered Office address at TUI Travel House, Crawley Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 9QL and Our Agreement With You sets out what you are legally entitled to expect from us when you buy a Package Holiday from us ..."
TUI have not been at that Crawley address since 2017.Again. TUI do not own Love Holidays.Only possible connection might be LH using TUI Airways flights for some holiday arrangements.You are correct that TUI is currently the largest ATOL licence holder. We Love Holidays Ltd is the 4th largest (AKA Love Holidays).
Again. TUI do not own Love Holidays.Did i say they did I believe i said you were rightI looked in to it deeper and Google is picking up something from the terms and condition associated with booking a TUI holiday through Love holidays. and then using it to answer do TUI own Love Holidays. Shows how the internet can spread false information even by accident.

Any suggested assistance would be appreciated...My son and 15 of his friends are supposedly travelling to Magaluf on Monday 3rd August. Love Holidays are nowhere to be found trying to help.The hotel which they booked has not opened this year but LH told my son that it was a non refundable booking so if he wanted to change to a different hotel he would have to pay for the new hotel and loose his money on the old hotel (NOW CLOSED).FCO have now listed Canaries and Balearics as No Non-Essential Travel and yet the holiday has not yet been cancelled with 5 days to go...Is there anywhere I can go to get information? Is there any one I can turn to as the boys have scrimped and saved for a holiday which they can no longer get insurance for never mind be safe going???
"If they didn't get insurance at the time of booking that won't work now.If they paid with a credit card they can raise the issue with the credit card company to get their money back.Finding threads like this with 400 complaints over 5 years after the deal has been made is a huge problem. There are SO many bad companies out there you really must find these warnings prior to giving your money to random companies.Suggest you skim the last 5-10 pages (50-100 posts) of this thread to see if there is any wisdom, but generally if you don't have insurance going back to the CC company is your only remaining option"
#438Did they book this as a package (flights+hotel booked at the same time)? Do they have an ATOL certificate?Which hotel is this?
