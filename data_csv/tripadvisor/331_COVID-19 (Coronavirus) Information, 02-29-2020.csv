"Since the first US death has been officially reported (a man in King County, Washington), test kits have been altered to be usable for Hawaii and other states, the CDC is recommending people stock 2 weeks worth of supplies........I thought I'd post a thread about the virus and info available for Maui and Hawaii.Two threads have already been closed by TA because they went into the political weeds. I ask that people PLEASE refrain from doing that to this thread. We are clearly heading into a long run of this virus and no doubt it *will* impact travelers and residents both. If you want to debate politics, the Off Topic Chatter Forum is great.Here are some news sources. These are all free. I use the NY Times a lot, but it isn't free. You may wish to check their subscription prices though, as they sometimes have sales.CNN: https://www.cnn.com/Hawaii News Now: https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/KHON: https://www.khon2.com/KITV: https://www.kitv.com/Civil Beat: https://www.civilbeat.org/…The Star Advertiser is another source, but I can't post the link without it posting my account...so sorry to say you'll have to google :-). Many of its articles are for paid subscribers only, too.For Maui, Maui Now and the Maui News *can be okay*. However, more and more, both have become shills for the HTA IMO. They also tend to be quite late in their ""news"".Maui News: https://www.mauinews.com/Maui Now: https://mauinow.com/Maui 24/7 is excellent for many news items.....but they lean more to things like accidents, rescues, etc. They are on Facebook--no account needed, just click outside the demands to log in or create an account, and scroll down.If you are traveling to Maui soon, I suggest you practice really good hygiene. Have hand sanitizer with you, don't ignore the pleas to cover your mouth etc when you sneeze, and above all---get medical attention if you are sick. Please don't spread something (flu, a cold, OR COVID-19) by ignoring the risk you pose to *others*.There are no travel restrictions to or from Hawaii at this time, except the same ones as the rest of the US. That probably won't change.....in other words, if travel to/from Italy is banned in New York, it will be everywhere in the US, or travel to Iran is banned, same thing.  Hawaii isn't a third world country, and there has never been a travel ban that was only in place for it. I mention this because there have been some comments otherwise :-).Above all----if you are unsure, worried to the point you will not be able to enjoy your trip---CANCEL. Plead for mercy from the airlines, hotels, condos, car rental, whatever you can do to lose less of your money. But don't come to Hawaii if you are going to be a nervous wreck and fearful of everything. That's just not healthy :-). If your trip is newly booked or farther out, you MAY be able to purchase CFAR trip insurance, but even that will only help so much-and it's very expensive.Be proactive, be realistic, and be kind to yourselves and others.SWEdited: 5:12 am, March 09, 2020 "

Spanish flu had a mortality rate of between 2 and 3%.
"Sue, do you realize that the mortality rate for the 1918 ""Spanish"" flu was 2 to 3%?? WHO has some excellent material for those who wish to dig deeper.Again--my post isn't to panic or spread panic. It is to give people choices to obtain information and news from a variety of sources. Each person needs to do their OWN RESEARCH and make their own decision(s)."
"Great minds, Kaeleku......Here's an older but very valid paper from WHO:https:/…9789241547680_eng.pdf"
My error. Two percent didn't seem all that terrifying to me. I've removed my post.
"Wondering what the impression is on those vacationing in HI right now vs. the residents. I live in WA and the only difference I see at the stores, for example is the absence of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Also, numbers the same at our gym, schools, etc. I've read posts from vacationers (can't remember which island) saying everyone is vacationing ""as usual"" whatever that means."
"I don't know how some tourists feel, but I spent some time with a few yesterday--who had much the same attitude as me: what will be, will be.....I'm sure there are some residents AND tourists panicking. But most residents here are pretty laid back about it right now. Some aren't, of course.I think that was on Oahu--but I haven't seen much difference here on Maui."
"I'm surprised frankly that ppl here in King Co aren't in a panic. I was at Costco today getting gas etc, and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. You'd think the shelves would be bare here too."
"Reminds me of the missle launch from North Korea. We decided a Mai Tai on the beach together watching the end.Of course nothing happened just like us flying to Hawaii two weeks after 911.Sorry folks, no one escapes life alive.Panic over yet another respiratory virus? Yeah NO."
"Thanks for all the links and this post SW. I have noticed more of these on other forums..Italy, France, etc and posted as a sticky on top of the recent conversations. They are continually being updated. I personally am feeling like we dodged a bullet by changing our Italy trip to 2021, although the change had nothing to do with the virus. Hope you and all our TA friends and family stay alert, healthy and virus free. Aloha!"
"What good would ""panicking"" really do? Be smart, but panic - no. Why?Anyone remember the news articles and videos back in 2001/2002 showing adults how to fit your child with gas masks and how to duct tape yourself into your living room safely in the event of an anthrax attack. It felt like fear mongering at the time.I think it helps to be smart. Yes, if you are (or in care of) and eldery/young child/or person at risk, stay home. As someone said, what will be, will be. My mom doesn't travel because she is in fear of dying in a plane crash. I think of all the places my kids and I have seen, and would have missed out on if that fear held true for me as well.I hope it does not become a pandemic, and I am sorry for anyone who has health challenges due to the virus. That being said, you never know what tomorrow will bring. Live life to the fullest, be smart, but don't live in fear."
"that's all these amateur posts really do, spread possible misinformation and cause people to panicthere are plenty of reliable sources available that can keep things in perspective and up to date"
"Gosh, John....how very unhelpful. Can you please tell me what links I posted that are unreliable sources, spread misinformation, or make people panic?I'm not a doctor, don't play one on TA--and never have claimed otherwise (unlike some people). But I think posting a variety of links for people to use and MAKE THEIR OWN judgments is more helpful than calling you names...........very sad you are more focused on attacking me than helping people.Yes---it was me who said many of us feel ""what will be, will be""......and also cautioned to use your head and good hygiene. People with impaired immune systems and the elderly seem to be the most susceptible.Edited: 4:01 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Well I’m not a Dr, a pilot or an astronaut as some have claimed....But I always bring hand sanitizer and wipes with on the plane and vacation (and usually have in my purse at home in case needed). Today I was shopping for some stuff for my trip next week and these things were sold out at the store. I think some are just getting prepared to be sanitary. Found it now and I’m ready. Nope I’m not canceling... I feel I can get it at home just as the same as in Maui. I just feel we have to continue living life and see what happens.Edited: 4:24 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Wife and I were out picking up travel goods for our trip in under three weeks. Hand sanitizer and wipes are in short supply but we did find some. We aren’t panicking and still planning on going - but that may change if anything develops. Friend of mine who is sanitizer obsessed even before all this, mentioned that Amazon is all out of the stuff. I believe in being prudent but some things are getting out of hand - like $20 N95 masks and $15 bottles of hand sanitizer"
Price gouging already? Isn't that against the law or only on some places or circumstances?
"It's not price gouging on private site/sellers....like Amazon. It's only price gouging in a physical location where there are no other choices. It's a complicated law.I was in Costco early in the week, and things were fine--it was well stocked and no signs. I hear they have instituted limits on things now. I was in Safeway yesterday and shelves were full and no limits.No, if planes cancel no condo or hotel ""has"" to give you your money back. I would def get insurance..if you can. Again, it will be CFAR, which is more expensive and also usually still only covers about 75%.People *think* it'd be fine and fun if their flights home get canceled. But having been in tourism during 09-11, I can tell you people didn't have fun at all."
"Yuppa - sites like Amazon operate under a different set of rules I did call Costco a few days ago and if we cancel for any reason by 3/16 (we leave on 3/20), and confirmed we would get 90% of our package price back as stated on our paperwork. IMHO, that’s fairEdited: 5:31 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"@Sarah H: By now Federal Way must look like Redmond and Issaquah right? I posted earlier this afternoon (pre announcement about the death) and it’s now in full hoard mode here. There are 1 hour waits at Costco for a shopping cart. Our Costco has predicted that their western WA stores will be out of stuff by tomorrow. We decided to cancel our upcoming trip for April. Alaska Air waived any fees and we can rebook a year from cancelled departure date. Only out $50 fee for condo cancellation and thanks to Discount Hawaii Car Rental’s easy policy, no hassles there. There are just too many unknowns about it right now. Best (for us) to stay put. For those that choose to go: my sincere wishes for safe travels"
"One hour waits for a shopping cart at Costco? wow!I'm doing my Costco regular shop tomorrow, be interesting to see the temperament of people, all rushing to one area, buying in more bulk than usual, also how many customers show up wearing masks and wiping down their carts before pushing them around.I have friends living in Japan, masks, toilet paper and surgical type gloves(so they don't touch anything) are in extreme short supply."
"Bellyqueen, that sounds awful.....I bet the regular stores are out of things too?I have heard many stories today about stores all over the country being out of things--from New York to Florida to California, Colorado, Arizona, Washington, Illinois, Minnesota, etc., etc. I understand you cancelling--and as I said many times already, people need to make those informed decisions and do what is best for them. Hawaii--or any other destinations--will still be there when this is over."
"@4SW: Yes, Fred Meyer (a grocery chain) Wal-mart, etc. was at both today and the shelves are BARE for items like pasta, rice, canned stuff, paper products. Even soda. Bottled water is gone too. We are basically at ground zero as we live very close to Evergreen hospital. People are nervous also because at a nearby skilled nursing facility (near Evergreen hospital) there are 2 confirmed cases of patients that are in long term or permanent care. There is no new news, just recycled stuff, but that is doing the job quite nicely. Schools are already scheduled to close and our Gov. has declared a state of emergency for WA. These are the kinds of events that reveal peoples' true character. We will wait and see what happens"
"Also from Seattle area and can confirm the craziness. Not only is the hand sanitizer gone from all 8 stores I checked today but it’s out online at every store I can think of too. And all the isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol is out at every store too. Are people seriously going to make hand sanitizer. I’m just annoyed because I use hand sanitizer on a regular basis and always carry it on me and I just happened to be low at the wrong time. Fear mongering. Telling people supplies might run low, so what happens? Everyone runs out and buys hoards of it. Not helpful. People should practice good hygiene year round anyways. With that said, we are still planning on going to Maui in June, unless something drastic happens. Can’t live your life in fear. Hoping it will be better by then. Better as in, under control, OR we know the outcomes more and aren’t so fearful of the unknown. Time should tell."
"Yes, people are going nuts. I didn’t have a Costco run planned today, but my mom went to Walmart and noticed the hand sanitizer had been cleaned out."
"I didn't go to any stores here on Maui today, but I bet they weren't that crazy. ....It might sound weird---but here, people go and hoard buy more often. So it's not such a sudden or unusual thing. Every summer we see this with hurricane season.I hope for the best for everyone."
We are due to fly to Maui on Fri Mar 13 (I knew I shouldn’t have booked for that day!). DH is very concerned and has been suggesting we should seriously consider cancelling. I cried and cried at the thought - our first real holiday in 10 yrs! And if we do cancel we’d have to wait until at least this time next year before we could go. I think I’ll crack up if we have to cancel!!
"""hoard buy"" Awesome term!! LOL"
"East, I understand, and think you have a very, very hard decision. It's been so long....Selfishly, I want you to come as planned. But I want all of you comfortable and feeling secure too."
"there were some folks posting on here wishing for a crash so tourists will stop coming to Maui, well they may get their wish the hard way"
"Thanks for posting this SW. I came here to see what was happening on Island and appreciate you posting this. We are coming to Maui the first week of April for 2 weeks. Its status quo for us at this point. As mentioned, people have to do what is right for them. They may have underlying medical conditions that are prudent not to ignore.I think people who panic about this type of thing are prone to that type of behaviour.Hand sanitizer is flying off the shelves here where I live too. Some stores, like London Drugs, have put them behind the counter at customer service and are only handing out 2 small travel sized bottles per person.To me, this is just an amped up ""flu season"". Same precautions apply.Wash your hands!!!"
I just saw this on CNN:https:/…
"You're welcome, Lori! Glad it helped and I think the CNN article you linked is good info too.I see that Washington thinks they may have or have had as many as 1500 cases. The senior/assisted living center mentioned by Bellyqueen seems to have more cases....,very sad and dangerous for those folks.Tourism will no doubt take a hit. How bad and for how long remains to be seen. We are a long way from the end of this, world wide."
"We were actually in Kirkland, Washington, where this care home is, two weeks ago on Valentines Day weekend.I will admit it gave me pause. My thoughts are with all health care workers during this very stressful time."
"the 1500 Number comes from folks who have self quarantined for ANY flu like symptoms, not who have tested positive for it."
"The report I read was an extrapolation by a medical hotshot at one of the universities....not a survey or something. He was also quoted as saying that the virus could have been in Washington for nearly 6 weeks.It was in the NY Times this morning. The major point in the report was that they really have NO idea how many cases there are in WA. or (of course) many, many other places."
Yes. Though an educated guess at this point. As of this morning Our ER’s are flooded now with ppl exhibiting ANY type of upper respiratory symptoms. You can be tested immediately for flu nasal swab. ( results for that are available within 30 min) but if assessment determines it’s not the flu and you exhibit flu symptoms then they test for it vis a blood test and send it out for evaluation (takes 24/48 hours)
"We are flying into Maui from the east coast via Las Vegas and HNL this Tuesday. Not any more concerned about contracting influenza than I usually am (I work direct patient care in a large hospital) or Coronavirus. Will take the usual precautions such as hand hygiene, wipe down seat table etc when boarding the plane. Any unexpected delays at the airports for additional screening for illness yet?"
"No, no delays in Hawaii.....not sure about other airports."
Great video (short) that explains Corona Virus. https://www.youtube.com/watch…

Wow! They must be concerned because people aren’t buying tickets?
"Teri, Yes! I don’t want this I just want $100 (or more) knocked off my trip. Lol!"
"Can't find hand santizer anywhere on the island and they laugh when we ask about it. Now that I see how people are reacting nationwide, we are strongly considering ending our trip at the end of this week and flying home from Maui instead of our original plan to fly over to Kauai for another 5 days. Feel like I'd like to get in and out of LAX for that connector sooner than later and get back to home in the Midwest sooner than later. Feel like home base is a better place to ride this out and as of now the midwest is calmer with no know cases (I know that can change in a minute).Sad about having to make this decision. Like others have said, it's funny to say I'd love to be stuck on an island but I do not want to be stuck anywhere that's not home longer than I planned. And this panic seems to be spreading fast."
"Think outside the box?Bath and Body, Michaels, Dollar store...there are many places that sell Hand sanitizer.Good luck with this difficult decision."
Amy - only you can decide what’s best for you. Just don’t let other’s actions or over reactions make that decision for you
"Even Ulta of all places was sold out and we were only one of a handful asking.Not worried about the virus as many have said.....worried about dealing with a clusterfudge at the airport in 10 days from now. Since it seems to be getting more dramatic by the day. Two days ago, never would’ve considered it. Ten days from now might be hard to fly off the west coast. We go through either LAX or SEA."
"Well Wisconsin and Illinois do.... and most likely many more places but it is ""unknown"" since they aren't testing more people yet. Personally I would stay and enjoy, but if you can't let it go and enjoy your time then yes I would go home. There is no point to stay if you are worried.Hula gave good suggestions.My guess is there will be warnings if airports will be shut down etc... they gave weeks warning to stop flights from overseasEdited: 10:50 pm, March 01, 2020 "

make your own sanitizer? (Though alcohol may also be hard to find)Love how it says you can use vodka in a pinch. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.azfamily.co…
I feel like I am not really making my point properly. It’s not about the hand sanitizer. It’s about how mass chaos can ensue so quickly.My husband‘s been on the phone with Delta for over an hour just to see what our options are . She said the call volume is to the extreme with people trying to change travel plans. Pickings are already slimming down.I just really worry about getting stuck not able to get home. I should’ve prefaced this by saying that this is a month-long trip so we really don’t need to take on anything longer.
"Amy, like I've been saying, only you can decide what is best for you. And yes--as I also said, being stranded ain't so great for many people. I understand what you are worrying about because I have seen it.Whatever you decide, best wishes.SW"
International terminal at hnl seemed strangely deserted today.
"SW remember the 2018 hurricane season and how we tracked them all summer long. Well the Corona virus is 2020's hurricane season.For those on the island it's a good idea to have alternative travel plans in place and getting up to speed on how airlines are going to handle a shut down situation, but if I were on the island I wouldn't be concerned with hand sanitizer I'd make sure I had at least 2 cases of bottled water.And if there's an airline shut down I sure as hell wouldn't be at the airport and no way would I give up my rental car. Also if you don't have any cash on you I'd find an ATM like in now!!! Draw out a min of $500.00 cash, cause when it comes down to paying for that last bottle of hand sanitizer cash will trump credit."
"Thanks Nick. I’m not making any moves yet, just considering smart options. The way this whole thing has been progressing, the next few days worth of headlines and mass reactions (or fingers crossed, lack there of) will help my decision."
"People landing in Venice said the screening for fever lasted less than 10 seconds. Venice reopened their museums today, (SEE Italy TA) . So I'm really not sure what the worry about the airport congestion is."
Good advice. That is a good read.I am flying over to Maui March 10. I travel by the seat of my pants usually. But this time for th First time in my life? I am concerned with the germs on the plane...
windy - not much you can do about the recirculated air but try to avoid anyone coughing/sneezing. We normally bring Clorox wipes to wipe down our tray tables but we see that wiping down seats and arm rests have been recommended.
"Coming from the state with 6 COVID-19 deaths (Washington), I'd be much more concerned about getting or having the virus *there*.I see no reason to panic in Hawaii. No, I do not think people need to rush ATMs, Costco, or any other store/site. We have NO cases here, anywhere in the state.......though yes, we have flu cases. I'm sure we will get coronavirus cases (probably already have some undiscovered, like most states)---but all this focus on Hawaii is misplaced. Look at the map, folks.Panic is counterproductive. It distracts from the real situation, inflates more conspiracy theories, brings scams and thieves out, and takes advantage of the most vulnerable."
They are closing Covid threads. Not travel related? Not family friendly? Advertisers complaining?
"I think that they are concerned that these threads get political and demeaning after a whileEdited: 3:51 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Has anyone called or contacted CSA travel insurance about whether or not the Coronavirus would be an acceptable reasoning to cancel and if this would be covered? I did not purchase at the time of booking, but if I understand correctly, I believe I am still able to purchase.?.?"
"As I mentioned in the first post, if this thread stays ON TOPIC it shouldn't be closed.Again, people need to read the reliable news sites and research. They should be comfortable with their choice(s), and also stay informed when on Maui (or in Hawaii).Local news sources are doing better now, but I still suggest people use major sources for the best up to date info."
"No, the only kind of insurance you will be able to recover money from will be ""Cancel For Any Reason"" policies. CFAR won't cover every penny or dollar, but it allows you to recover a good amount depending on the company.Viruses etc. are not covered under standard trip insurance. If flight were canceled by government authorities (such as the bans on some destinations), you can sometimes get a partial refund.You probably won't be able to buy insurance now if your trip is soon, either.Edited: 3:59 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"SW reliable news site now that's funny.Like the ones over the weekend showing long lines at Costco. There's always long lines at Costco on weekends especially at the beginning of the month. I wonder if the news will report about the long lines at the return counter at the end of the month. ""I'd like to return this case of hand sanitizer and 10 packages of toilet paper"""
"Well unfortunately for one half of the country, ""becoming political"" means acknowledging about a pandemic virus outbreak is even taking place and/or using facts.Edited: 2:25 am, March 03, 2020 "
Here’s and an article on CFAR insurance https:/…Hopefully this will help somebody. It’s pretty restrictive and you need to buy it soon after your first deposit or booking of your trip along with other restrictions.
"Costco in Hawaii doesn't have lines like these were, just cause it's the first of the month or start of a discount booklet. However, ahead of any serious tropical storm threat, longshoremen slow down in CA, or strike action--yes, we see very long lines and people buying large quantities of things. Rice, TP, paper towels, detergent, noodles, pet food, water, and canned food are the most common. So this isn't odd to *us*---it's just a different type of event.While Costco will allow returns of most items, they have cracked down. The 'regular' grocery stores are MUCH more strict about returning items, so don't overbuy. You may not be able to return any food or beverage items period.That's a good summary about CFAR--thanks for posting, I think it will help people who are planning trips or have one booked. I had mentioned in the header post that it's expensive and needs to be purchased early, but the article explains it in more detail :-).Edited: 5:35 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"We have a couple of travel MEDICAL insurance and EVACUATION/REPATRIATION (to home) coverages because we travel to weird places :)These are yearly coverage, costing $1000+I asked them what about COVID. They will provide assistance but cannot evacuate you or take you home, as for any contagious disease. Fair enough. If you get seriously ill far from home, you are stuck where you are until you are not contagious."
"AK I had no idea how restrictive CFAR insurance was until all this because I looked into buying it butfor my trip in May but it doesn’t make sense for this trip. If I had just booked an expensive condo or home and I was going soon enough that I couldn’t cancel before final payment I’d buy it. If losing your deposit is less than the insurance then I’d skip it. Btw out local stores are out of hand sanitizer and Safeway has put a limit on two tubs of Clorox wipes per purchase, at least at our stores. The schools are requesting supplies from the community since they are rapidly running out."
"I go by ""SW"".....just fyi :-).Indeed, it is very tough (CFAR). I've posted about it for years, and many times people don't understand that it is completely different than ""normal"" trip insurance.Many Americans don't buy trip or travel insurance, compared to Europeans. It's pretty dumb, IMO.......virus or not, there are often reasons people have to cancel trips. Many lodgings--esp condos--have strict no refund policies, and airlines are getting tougher and tougher."
"SW, yes I always buy it for Kauai especially since we don’t stay in hotels that can be canceled a couple days before we leave. I wouldn’t be canceling at this point, we have cases in the next county over so it’s just a matter of time before it’s here. I’d be more worried about bringing it to Hawaii than anything. Our schools are making there own hand sanitizer with help from the PTA. Rubbing alcohol and aloe vera gel. Until we run out of rubbing alcohol! I guess you can substitute cheap vodka but that might not be a good idea at school."
"LOL.......on the other hand....cheap vodka might be what the parents and staff need the most!You're smart, ref the travel insurance. Honu also raised a good point-- extra medical coverage (beyond what your own medical insurance may cover)."
"Maybe I did it wrong: I looked into CFAR insurance a couple trips ago as we booked almost a year in advance. Based on our ""advanced"" age, it really drove up the price. (we're in 50's and 60's). It ended up being more than the 2 week condo rental! And even then the payout wan't 100%. Does that sound like an accurate scenario?"
"It sounds like you maybe duplicated coverage.....in other words put the same amount in for 2 people?That might have skewed the quote. You would only want 2 airfares and 1 condo cost.....so if you were getting a quote you might have gotten one for the condo x 2 people?I may be confuzzing you more, not less, LOL. But something def doesn't sound right. It ain't cheap but it's not *that* much!"
"We have always bought travel insurance for our trips - domestic and international. CFAR does have to be purchased right around when you book and it is not cheap but we have never felt the need to purchase. We are lucky that we purchased our vacation package (flight, hotel and car rental) thru Costco and I called and verified that If we cancel for any reason by 3/16 (our trip departs on 3/20), we will get 90% of our package price back as per our paperwork. That’s pretty fairly, imho"
"I agree--Costco is more than fair. They are the largest travel wholesaler in the world so they have a pretty big cushion :-).Independent travelers or people who book separate parts of trips (like condo, air, car all separate) are the ones who need to consider insurance. Whether it's CFAR or more limited policies, people should look.With this virus--airlines are really cracking down already, on waiving fees or giving refunds. The Air Travel Forum and other Air forums are full of sad stories and pleas for help with getting refunds or even travel credit. Of course, most are having NO luck at all.Hotels have been nicer...so far. But that could change too. Private condos are a wild card--but in the past, they were nice at first and then stuck to no refunds after a couple of months (in the recession and after 09-11, for example).Edited: 7:37 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"I have never purchased travel insurance before. And once again, when I booked my accommodation for my upcoming May/June trip, I didn't purchase it. But now in retrospect, between my parents' fairly new health conditions (my father had a heart attack in October) and the uncertainty of what will happen as a result of the Coronavirus, I am thinking that I should have made the purchase. Could have, should have, didn't. From what I understand, in speaking with a couple of agents, CFAR insurance can only be purchased 72 hours after the initial booking. I booked my reservations (at three different locales - the Inn at Mama's Fish House, the Wailea Ekahi (through a private owner from whom I rented last year) and Kapalua Bay Villas (through Quam) last July. So it would seem that the window of opportunity to purchase that particular type of insurance has expired. Also to note, I made my 50% deposits (for each of set of accommodations) at the time of booking, with the remainder to be paid at each respective property 60 days before check-in. I can cancel my reservations entirely without a penalty (or at least a nominal one) as long as I cancel 60 days out.Those dates are soon approaching. I check into Mama's on May 11, I check into Ekahi on May 16, and I check into Kapalua Bay Villas on May 22, where I am supposed to stay until my return home to Ottawa on June 9).Mama's is not a huge concern (I would forfeit one night's accommodation by cancelling), but I am wondering now, if I should cancel my other bookings, rebook and immediately purchase the CFAR insurance. Even then, I am not sure if I would be covered, given the current CVOID-19 situation.I spoke to an agent today and they weren't entirely sure what I would be covered for, but said that they would get back to me, although it might take a while, as they have received a spike in calls.I also called my bank today regarding the credit card to which I have charged my accommodations thus far. They informed me that due to unforeseen situations (such as travel advisories and sickness/death of an immediate family member), I would be reimbursed up to a maximum of $5K. My entire accommodation costs are much more than that so if I were to rely on the credit card insurance exclusively, I would still be out a considerable chunk of money.All to say, I am not sure what I will or should be doing. This is clearly a personal choice, but it is a difficult decision to make, for certain."
"I am a believer in travel insurance as I have had to use it 4 times in say 20 years, once for work and 3 times for a relative that became illfor us the most important clause is the waiver on pre-existing medical conditions for travelers and immediate family not travelingthe clause is free but you have to buy the policy within a certain time frame usually 14 days from your first trip deposit"
"Reau, check the fine print on the CC. If a travel advisory is issued while you are *on* the trip, it may or may not be covered. Also check on coverage for the illness/death scenario, because it often only applies to certain situations and *not* pre-existing conditions that could be foreseen (e.g., heart).I suspect the cost of CFAR on the whole trip (if the agent says you can cancel/rebook/buy) will make your eyes water like a hot curry. You may decide better to roll the dice with what you have......"
"I think that I am becoming a believer too. John, you mention the insurance has to be purchased, usually within 14 days from the first trip deposit. Are you referring to the CFAR variety or for the typical trip cancellation/interruption insurance, or both? Also, I have received some confusing advice from the travel insurance I company I dealt with yesterday. They said that if I were to now purchase trip cancellation/interruption insurance, I would only be covered (in a situation of family illness or death) as long as the family member did not live with me, regardless of whether they had a pre-existing medical condition. However, if the family member lives with me and has a pre-existing medical condition, I would not be covered. I have to admit, I am finding this all very perplexing."
"I stay at Mama's pretty often & am fairly sure they have a 30-day cancellation window, I've used it more than once."
"Reau, much depends on the company.......you need to know what company John is using.--plus whether their CA policies/terms are the same as their US.The exemption (or non-coverage) for a person living with you is not unusual.Edited: 8:50 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Thanks SW - I will check the details/fine print. But when you say that ""if a travel advisory is issued during my trip, it may or may not be covered."" I'm not sure if I understand entirely what you mean here. If I'm in Maui and a travel advisory is issued, I would have to remain on island and would not be forfeiting my accommodation costs. Are you saying that if I'm in Maui and a travel advisory issued and I can not fly back as scheduled, then the insurance would not cover the additional costs of accommodation?Re. pre-existing medical condition, that's where I am uncertain, particularly given what the agent told me yesterday (please see my post above to John)."
"If John posts the company onfo you can make sure you get a quote from them. I know he's posted it before-maybe Allianz...but I can't recall.Travel Advisories are funny. It depends on *what the advisory says*. We see it with approaching hurricanes, when airlines say they will waive changes for XXX, YYY, and ZZZ days. If you don't take advantage of that--nope, many policies will NOT cover you staying beyond the date certain. Or, say an advisory is issued at Level 2 (meaning sort of okay but maybe shouldn't go) the day before you leave for Maui. You go anyway but then they raise it a week later to a 3 and you want to leave. They won't pay the airfare difference because you ""shouldn't"" have come. Again--these are worst case examples.....but you can see how tricky it can get.Many policies don't pay for extended lodgings.....only refunds or changes to air tickets. Be careful, friend."
"""Well unfortunately for one half of the country, ""becoming political"" means acknowledging about a pandemic virus outbreak is even taking place and/or using facts.""Thank you SW!"

"LOL Thank you ""Kaeleku"""
*sigh* - this is why I say that some threads get closed Reau - check with InsureMyTrip.com or Squaremouth.com. Not sure what they can offer you but you can get clarification on policies and under what conditions do they become voided and the like
"Yeah, LOL..........but Dusty---please stop bringing politics in. I ask that you respect my thread and don't get it closed. Kaeleku's post doesn't need to lead to a war with you or anyone else, okay? Please?There are some good tips and good discussions in this thread. Let's not screw it up."
"I’m with you Reau... I’m not really worried about my trip starting next week, but my June... but I’m thinking we will just go with it and hope for the best. I could cancel by April 10 and the flights can be rebooked up until New Years (when I booked them). But as long as they don’t cancel flights, we will be going.Ps love the new avatar.Edited: 9:28 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Reau, what you need is a good independent insurance agent you can talk to and give you advice. They can compare with different insurance companies and you can compare prices and policies. If it looks like you may have to pay some big bucks for insurance get a professional."
"Herfnerd gave you great advice, Reau. Travel Insurance isn't the same as other types of insurance.Edited: 9:31 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"The virus is definitely having an economic impact on the travel and tourism industry here in the US. The housewares convention in Chicago which draws 60,000 attendees has just been cancelled due to concerns about the virus."
"We will see more effects--all over the US--as this grows. Hoard buying is already a problem in many places, including ones that don't have any cases at all.Hawaii isn't immune-to either the virus or the effects. But it is somewhat more ""business as usual"" so far here. The hoard buying is normal for any storm situation, for example-or as I mentioned, a dock strike or longshoremen slowdown. Tourists are more panic driven than us. Again, if you are here or coming soon--be careful how crazy you go buying stuff. Two years ago all the regular grocery stores stopped allowing people to return cases of bottled water, for example. You bought it, you got it.......end of story."
SW! All I did was thank you! I did not bring politics into this (maybe a little)! You did! I agree with you!

"@4SW: I just went to insure my trip. Com and did a quote for travel on April 2021, comprehensive,CFAR booked today.  it was just a matter of plugging in dollar amts. so condo, plus airfarex2, plus car. Then it spit out a quote that was around $570I must have been much closer to my travel dates the last time I asked for a quote. Still, $570 is a hunk of $$.Edited: 1:10 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Reau,I use Travelguard and I believe there is Travelguard CanadaThey have an easy to use website that compares coverages for several policies starting at a more bare bones coverage to a policy that has lots of options and very rich benefits and the prices are shown for eachin the US there are 3 policies to choose fromthe staff at TG has been great in going over each side by side and the pro/cons of each and which would work best for my situation and budgetyou might try talking to them and get a feel for there coverages and how they workI did see some answers to your question but most of it is incorrect from any policy I have bought or used, best to talk to them directly good luck"
"Belly - CFAR has always been pricey and we never purchase it. We went with Travelers International which is a C&F company which was only around $120 - for additional primary medical coverage, medical evac and repatriation. The missed connection, lost/delayed luggage and the like are just extras. Than again, booking with Costco, we can cancel the package four days from our departure for any reason and get 90% of it back, within two days and we can get 85% back but there are some penalties with the hotel"
"Thank you Herfnerd - I will check with the companies you suggested.Thanks also to you FishDiva - that was a good suggestion that I speak directly with independent insurance companies. And John, many thanks to you as well - I will look into Travel Guard Canada. I have a lot to chew on over the next few days. One thing that I don't have to worry about is health/medical insurance. I am covered on that front with supplementary health coverage provided through my public service health care plan.TB4 - Good luck with your planning as well. And thanks for the comment on my recently updated avatar. Sending best wishes to all and safe travels during this uncertain time."
"I just went to the Travel Guard site, as per John's suggestion, filled in some basic information, and got a quote of approx. $450 (CDN I assume, since I went to the Canadian Travel Guard site) for trip cancellation/interruption insurance. Not bad. I'll call and speak with a representative, just so I am fully informed of what I would be covered for in case I need to cancel or interrupt my trip as a result of a travel advisory or sickness in my family. I would not cancel my trip out of fear or uneasiness (but only if the situation warrants it, again travel advisory or illness/death in family). Thanks again!Edited: 6:30 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Reau - doesn't hurt to shop aroundTravel Guard is found on those two sites I listed - we have purchased their policies in the past. The site makes it easy to compare providers/policies from different companies as well as read user reviews fabout them, check out their AM rating, how long they have been in business and how many policies they have sold since their inception.We do change up providers based on the plan and what they offer as well as their respective costs. There are differences in domestic, international and cruise policies so its nice to be able to compare them from on one site. Its also nice to be able to contact someone that can assist you in making the right choiceEdited: 7:25 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Travel insurance is confusing. I talked to Costco travel yesterday. It seems if I cancel at any point I lose $200 per airline ticket and the closer to travel date I also lose 10% to 25% of hotel/car. American Air offers affordable CFAR and the one page document I have access to does not mention any penalties at all, which I find hard to believe. Note: I’m trying to book a new trip for 2021. This is not an existing trip. We typically have not bought insurance. But my travel companion is elderly so we have started to buy it for the past couple of trips. I’m not too concerned with flu/virus as much as I buy 10 months out and a lot can happen in that time."
"Reauglad you are making progress and I agree with Herf to shop aroundthere maybe other companies that better fit your needsi will say one thing about Travelguard in the USAI had to put in 4 claims over the years worth $1000s of dollars and they paid with no hassle.I think the key to us is to buy the policy right away to have pre-existing medical conditions waived. It does not cost anything and covers all immediate family whether they live with you or not and they do not need to be travelingthat was 2 of our claims, my wife's mother who did not live with us took ill from a long time illnesssimple form from the dr and they paidgood luck"
"We're going to Vegas in May yesterday I thought I'd seen the first sign of a corona effect travel price drop, but today I think it was just dumb luck on my part.I booked a rental car several weeks ago on Costco. The price has not dropped at all. Yesterday I checked and it had dropped by $40.00, Book-it a good SCORE.Today the same car is $80.00 more then yesterday like I say dumb luck on my part, but I will take it."
"Yes Costco is great but the airline portion still goes by the airlines rules I believe. I’ve only booked the flight with Costco a couple times because I usually have points to use. Even with points the airlines charge you to put them back in your account. Sometimes if it’s on one ticket the will only charge one account.Facebook just held off on a big conference in San Jose. If you want to stay at the Mark Hopkins on Nob Hill in SF the next couple weekends= $125 a night!Edited: 10:42 am, March 03, 2020 "
This is an interesting website for informationhttps:/…
"Thanks, Nickers! That is a good one."
"Hula - Yuppa, when i confirmed with Costco last week, up to four days prior to departure, it was 90% refund if you cancel - basically we lost the $200 pp for the AA flights and $30pp for the inter-island flights. This is due to what sc said - airline rules. But when you spend $5700 on a package, I am not going to cry too much about losing $460 if we have to cancel. Not even sure if CFAR policies would be able to do any better."
"yes the CFAR add on is pretty expensive and you only get back50% to 75% but it does work if you are going on a trip and the cancellation clauses have not kicked in but you are skittish about going right now you can't get a claim approved for say an upcoming cruise as the ship is still going but if you don't want to go and you have CFAR option purchased you can get some money back if you choose not godon't need to give the insurance company a reasonEdited: 11:42 am, March 03, 2020 "
"We are booked to travel to Hawaii for the first time on March 18th and were SO very excited. Have Oahu, Maui and Big Island on the itinerary. Now am in a quandary as to whether we should travel or cancel? Totally confused.Edited: 11:49 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Dogmon, you are the only one who can decide for you......here are some questions I think you need to ask yourselves.*Will you be comfortable flying through mainland airports?*Will you be comfortable far from home, should any of you become ill (with any illness!)?*Why do you want to cancel--because of news on the mainland, or rumors/fears about Hawaii?*Can you afford the loss of $$$, or get travel credits/vouchers/refunds?"
"I missed my edit window....one of the most important questions (IMO) is:**Are you in good health overall, without any immune system and/or respiratory issues?"
Thanks much for your inputs ! I guess it is a call we need to take as a family ! It is not an easy call :(
I would like to follow this forum to see future posts. How do I do that? I am ending up searching all over to find this. Thanks in advance for any help !
"Update on travel insurance. I have been busy this morning conducting some research about different types of Travel Insurance (in preparation for my upcoming trip). The findings have been informative.First things first, I wanted to figure out what the total cost of my trip would be - flights, car rental, hotel (Mama's) and condo bookings (Wailea and Kapalua). I then subtracted out the costs related to flights since I booked a flight that allows for changes. I subtracted out the costs relating to car rental since I am not required to pay for those costs upfront. I subtracted out the costs of accommodation at Mama's since the booking can be cancelled within 30 days of arrival - after the 30 day window, I would forfeit my deposit (very manageable - essentially, one night's accommodation). I then went to the Travel Guard, Insure My Trip, and Square Mouth sites. I also spoke live to a Travel Guard representative.My findings:Travel Guard: will offer me trip cancellation/interruption insurance at a rate of $430, based on my travel cost estimate. I can purchase this type of insurance up to a day prior to travel. If a travel advisory were issued and I could not travel to Maui, I would be 100% reimbursed. It would also cover situations when I had to cancel or interrupt a trip due to illness (my illness or an illness of a family member, i.e. my dad). However, if I have a pre-medical condition or if a family member (even though they are not travelling with me) has a pre-medical condition, I would not be covered. I would only be covered if our respective medical situations were stable and controlled 90 days leading up to the purchase of the insurance. This is not my situation. My father had a heart attack in October 2019 and remains under a treatment plan. In fact, he has a cardiac ablation scheduled for tomorrow. All to say, it is highly unlikely that I would be covered if I had to cancel or interrupt my trip if something were to happen to my father (I don't even like to imagine the thought). I also mentioned to the Travel Guard agent that the credit card to which I have and will be charging my accommodation provides me with $5K worth of insurance. I asked if I could lower my travel cost quote by $5K for a new estimate. The response was a firm “no”. I am required to register the entire policy with one insurance provider. Insure my trip: I checked their policy as well, and plugged in the total cost of my trip (again extracting costs relating to flight, car rental, and accommodation at Mama's). The quote was considerably higher but not a game changer - $671 (with Manulife) and $681 with Travel Guard. When I read the terms of the policy, once again, I discovered that I would not be covered if I had to cancel my trip due to my father's medical condition. The terms of the policy are very specific. I would not be eligible if: 1) my immediate family's medical condition has not been stable and controlled; 2) my family member’s heart condition has required them to use, take or be prescribed to take nitroglycerin any form more than once a 7 day period; and 3) if my family member's lung condition has required the use of home oxygen or has required them to take oral steroids (prednisone, prednisolone)Square Mouth: The rates quoted by Square Mouth ranged from approx. $1400 to $1900. Very expensive. I didn't read the policy terms regarding pre-medical condition.Bottom line: If I were to chose one provider, I would probably go with Travel Guard (of the three referenced above), but knowing full well, that I would be entirely on the hook if I had to cancel or interrupt due to a medical emergency for my father.I will keep up with my research to see if there is a company that provides coverage when there are pre-medical conditions. Will keep you updated."
"Dogmom---You can bookmark this thread.........or you can go to your own history and click on your posts in this thread.Each person or family's situation is unique. While I think it's good to read a variety of opinions..in the end, only YOU can decide what is right for YOU.Edited: 12:30 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Good info Reau...it sounds like Squaremouth's quotes include pre-existing medical conditions, perhaps? That would make sense in my experience."
"We just cancelled our Seattle trip due to the spread as well as other factors but will wait and see with our Maui fall trip.In terms of travel, we've considered the co-morbidity data (which of course changes) from the American College of Cardiology: ""Overall the case mortality rate remains low at 2.3%; however, the mortality rate jumps to 6% in hypertensives, 7.3% in diabetics, 10.5% in patients with cardiovascular disease and 14.8% for patients equal to or above age 80"". We'll be keeping an eye on new information as it comes in.If there's a place with a lot of community spread and uncertainty about how it's being handled, it's a red flag for us. I also think that for a trip I'd bring a month of meds (I'm on a couple of orphan type meds) in case of quarantine which would be difficult for me to get on a holiday. It could also prove to be quite expensive for accommodation, etc. BCAA (I guess the equivalent in the US would be AAA which I know nothing about) is good about covering pre-existing illnesses but of course, you pay more.So, lots to consider. I wish the best for you all. I haven't heard of any cases in Maui but perhaps there are some.Edited: 1:26 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"good infothat is why I buy the policy as soon as I make a first deposit and then it includes the waiver of pre-existing condition like your dad's and it is covered we have benefited from the waiver several,times with no problemthe claim form did not even ask about my in laws prior medical history or treatment as we had the waiver included, they only wanted to know what was going on right then and there that we had to cancel the tripEdited: 1:30 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"the price for the policy is the same with or without the waiver of pre existing condition with Travelguardyou just have to buy the policy within 14 days of your first deposit and the clause about pre-existing conditions is ""waived"""
Thanks everyone for all the research. It was confirmed what I suspected: the very things I would need insurance for aren’t covered.
"That's too bad, Bellyqueen......but glad you have been able to get the info and look it all over.A person who died in Seattle *before* any known cases has now been ruled to have died from the virus. This goes to the belief the virus has been circulating much longer than thought.The markets aren't doing well again......the cut by the Fed didn't help in the end.Do your research...including whether a recession will mean you shouldn't have spent money on a vacation. Make the best decision for YOU and your family."
"Thanks so much John - good advice for me for next time. In the meantime, I'm scrambling to see if any insurance company would cover me (and reimburse costs) if I have to cancel or interrupt a trip due a medical emergency involving my dad who has a pre-medical condition."
"Reau, hopefully a rep from Squaremouth can explain and help you."
Our flight to Maui goes through Seattle. I am considering changing it.

"Reau - that would work but its a lot more of a hassle than its probalby worth. Not to mention that your new booking may not be the same as the original, depending on how long ago it was booked"
Steve mine does next week...but I figure that any airport probably has equal risk. Plus the majority of people I come in contact with are others going through..not from Seattle.
"Herfnerd - I figured the same. I also deleted my post, because I didn't think my musings were quite appropriate."
TB. We went through Seattle because I hate the sh## I always have to go through at LAX. Besides they have a good Denny’s at Sea-Tac
"Here's a good ""checklist"" and info sheet from the CDC about travel:https:/…faqs.html"
"So the latest number I saw was 123 cases (the most recent a Vet in California) in the US.None that we know of anywhere in Hawaii...though between testing issues (all the kits are being held by Oahu) and more, I don't believe that like I did 3 weeks ago, LOL.......Japan has started talking about delaying the Olympics. There are a growing number of events being cancelled on Oahu. I think we will see more in the next week or so."
I pick Seattle because it gets me to Maui the quickest of all my connection choices. I think I’ll be going to Denny’s! Thanks I didn’t know! I think that is exactly it SW. we really have no idea how many have it here because they haven’t been testing like other places. And last I heard the numbers were taken off the website so there’s that too...
"I think the scariest part of this coronavirus outbreak is that people can spread the virus without symptoms, so they can think they're perfectly healthy while they actually contribute to the pandemic. So while I'm definitely glad people will take washing hands more seriously, I have to say that I hope the US government provides and mandates those face masks for everyone to wear, even if they don't seem sick, especially while traveling. Seems more feasible/favorable to a quarantine."
"Face masks do nothing. Virus travels right through the fibers. Also gets into eyes.Face masks Are designed for sick ppl to wear. Since this appears to be transmittable if you’re asymptomatic, it’s. Moot point to even suggest themEdited: 12:12 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Not just that, but the virus lives on surfaces for around a week. Plus unless the masks actually fit properly they're basically useless."
"So weird how this is playing out in the diff. regions of the US. here at “ground zero” as folks here are calling it anyway, it’s chaos. Amazon has already delegated ppl work from home (employee has tested positive). The skilled nursing facility where many have succumbed to the virus is locked down and love ones on the outside cant communicate with their loved ones, some of whom have cognitive disabilities. The facility isn’t answering phones. Schools in our town are closed and events canceled. It’s all ANYONE is talking about. Our gym is deserted, freeways are light. We’re seeing a definite impact. Posts from the mid west seem different than in WA. Hope everyone stays as healthy as possible."
"Bellyqueen, I’m sorry, that sounds really scary. I really for the people in the nursing home and their families."
"bq - definitely feel for you, hopefully all goes well. I was reading an article in the guardian about your region, if this is the care in one of the wealthiest regions of the US, we're in deep trouble. Inconceivable that even after months of warning, tests are still not generally available. They say epidemics expose the weaknesses in a country, apparently in ours the weaknesses are a weak and profit-driven medical system, and a complete inability to plan or utilize facts. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…"
"I thought that I would update you on an email exchange that I had with an insurance agent about trip cancellation and interruption coverage.See below for an extract of that conversation:I understand you would like to know if we have any Policies that can offer Trip Cancellation due to a Coronavirus outbreak in your destination area.I apologize, travel insurance only covers for unforeseen events and circumstances. As such, coronavirus is considered foreseen by all providers. Unfortunately, you cannot purchase a policy as of now and be covered for any Cancellation, Interruption or any Delay benefits. The only possibility would be to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason policy. This is an optional upgrade that some policies offer. You would need to purchase a policy within 14-21 days after your initial Trip Booking date. Cancel For any reason costs an average of about 40% more premium and you can only claim for up to 75% of the insured Trip Cost.Many policies would exclude coverage for Cancellation or Interruption due to a Pre-Existing Medical condition of your own or a family member. There are some policies that offer a waver to this exclusion. Pre-Existing Condition coverage is time-sensitive, meaning it is typically only available for 14-21 days after a traveler makes their initial trip deposit. Additionally, most policies may require you to insure 100% of your trip cost in order to be eligible for Pre-Existing Condition coverage."
Yuppa - that's pretty much my understanding of CFAR policies.
"""Posts from the mid west seem different than in WA.""Yes. Everything is business as usual here in Ohio. For better or worse."
"Well.....up until yesterday when NC got its first confirmed case (the person traveled to Seattle and visited the nursing home at Ground Zero) it was business as usual. Now the Nextdoor sight is blowing up with talk about homeschooling kids and buying supplies. I just don't know what people want these days. Those that are ""infected"" and show absolutely no signs of the virus can spread it, so short of everyone staying home, what is the alternative? I'm just going to go about my daily business but be more diligent with who I come in contact with and make sure I wash, wash, wash my hands......Edited: 9:23 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Reau, thanks for that. It is pretty much what I've been saying all along...even before this virus (about CFAR). I appreciate you posting it from a ""reliable source""---maybe people will stop snarking at me now.Herfnerd, that's also exactly the point. How many people did the NC victim contact in airports, car rental, hotel/restaurants, parking lots, grocery or other stores...........and their office (if they work)?People need to accept that this is long since out of the ""bag"". There is no magic wand or genie to put it back in the bottle. It *will* reach all over the US, and yes, into Hawaii---sooner or later."
"In his editorial in today's Chicago Tribune, Steve Chapman cites a Harvard epidemiologist, Marc Lipsitch, who estimates that 20% to 60% of adults worldwide will contract COVID-19. He says that the death toll in just the US could reach the millions. The editorial also speaks to the pandemic causing a recession. In another Tribune story, the Illinois director of public health is going to Washington to appeal for federal help. The story says that the entire state has only 2200 test kits for this virus. I am starting to think about this pandemic in terms of the hurricanes that threaten Hawaii (and *anywhere*). The Nashville tornado was awful, but it came, and it left. One of the worst outcomes is when a storm stalls -- over the islands, Houston, anywhere -- dumping rain for a long time, prolonging the misery. This COVID-19 appears to be a slow storm. It's not like ordinary flu, although it is respiratory and the mortality is high in people whose health is already compromised. People have tested negative for COVID-19 once, even twice, then they test positive. People develop the disease following two weeks of quarantine. People 'recover', then relapse. I don't think there are enough 'preventatives' in the world to put a fast end to this. (I also don't see how a worldwide recession won't result.)Also, in the US and worldwide there are many more elderly people than in 1918 -- and many more are in congregate living.Edited: 11:52 am, March 04, 2020 "
"New update regarding insurance. I spoke with a Travel Guard agent a few minutes ago and was advised that if I were to purchase trip cancellation and interruption coverage with them, all non-reimbursable costs would be covered as long as I purchased the policy before a travel advisory was issued. So as of today, if I were to purchase the insurance, I would be protected as a flight advisory has not been issued by Canadian authorities. That’s a no brainer for me. Will be purchasing this as soon as I get home."
Reau.....I hate to be the downer....but that sounds too good to be true--esp considering how long ago your trip was booked.I'd want that in writing from them on company letterhead before I spent a penny........is this CFAR or ?
This isn’t CFAR but the silver level trip cancellation and interruption insurance. I asked if they could email me to confirm this in writing but they said that this is clearly stated on their website under the terms and conditions of the policy. I’ll be reading their policy closely.
"Highly doubt that is the case. Most of the chatter I've been reading is that all non-CFAR insurance does not cover COVID-19 as that was a ""known risk"" since late January."
"But they indicated that as long as a travel advisory has not been issued, I would be covered. Yes, i agree, I should get it in writing."
"Reauyup thats the way it works thanks for the summarythat helps clear up some of the other misinformation posted here about how the policies workit really helps to have actually used them to understand how they work as it is a confusing subject and lots of fine print we deposit, we buy right away and insure 100% of the trip, which we did and we automatically get the waiver of pre- existing conditions at no costthe longest window for that waiver that I found was 21 days initial deposit it is cheaper for us now in that we can buy a policy that does not include cancel for work, that cuts the premium by about 25%I just look at it as the cost of traveling and we are way ahead of having to eat costs for some trips we had to cancelBy the way when we cancelled and put in several claims they did not ask, us tp prove we insured 100% of the trip, they just wanted receipts for what we paid in deposits and they even reimbursed us for the redrposit fee of our frequent flyer miles back into my accountalso the premiums seem to be priced in brackets so $1600 is the same as $1950 but changes over say $2000so I sometimes can over insure just to be safe and have a cushion at no cost, some costs might come up that I didn't think of think you are set for the future and thanks for doing a tutorial for usbeing being able to purchasebefore a travel advisory is pretty standard for that one event good luckEdited: 1:00 pm, March 04, 2020 "
how the policy works for travel advisors is written right into the contract and you can read it it think they have a sample policy that you can read before you purchase on their web site
Thanks John - I will definitely review the sample policy wording and take a screen shot of it for future reference.
"if you buy the policy they will email you a copy of your policy or if you prefer they will mail you hard copy via the post office once the policy is issued you can make changes to it online such as different dates, costs and even destinationthey recalculate the premium and either charge you the higher premium or refund the differencewe were going to the BI in April this year and I bought the policy, we decided to go in Oct so I went online made all the changes to the policy with the new dates and costs no problem"
"I just got back from a month stay on Maui, Kauai and Oahu. I honestly wasn't concerned. Even on Oahu, I didn't see a lot of people wearing masks, although Long's had a sigh that they were sold out of masks. People on Kauai seemed more interested in the Daybell case than the virus."
"But you bought right away, John.....right after booking.Reau booked months ago.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Regarding the Travel Guard Insurance - as I mentioned, the agent clearly indicated that even though I made my booking a while ago, I would still be covered by their policy as long as I purchased it before there was a formalized travel advisory. They indicated that this is stipulated in their policy. Again, this is not a CAFR insurance but rather trip cancellation and interruption insurance. With the CAFR insurance, SW, you are correct, I would have had to purchase it shortly after the initial booking. This is not the case, however, with the trip cancellation and interruption insurance. Big relief.I checked the policy terms, and the covered risks are stated as follows:Covered Risk 14. Travel Advisory – A “defer travel” recommendation or a written formal notice is issued after Your Departure Date by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade of the Canadian Government or Health Canada advising travellers not to travel to a country, region or city specifically listed as a destination on Your itinerary of Your Insured Trip. (As of today, no travel advisory has been issued from Canada, advising against travel to Hawaii. So up to this point, so I would be covered)Covered Risk 29. Quarantine or Hijacking – You, Your Spouse, Your Dependent Child, Your Travel Companion, or Your Travel Companion’s Spouse or Dependent Child is quarantined or hijacked. So it would seem that it would be best for me to purchase the policy asap.I just came home so will look into this further and purchase the policy either today or tomorrow."
"Further John, this is one company, in the Canadian market. You congratulating her for ""clearing up misinformation"" is not particularly helpful. For example here is Allianz' policy:As of February 3, 2020, both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization have recognized 2019 Novel Coronavirus as an Epidemic. Many travel protection plans exclude losses caused directly or indirectly by an Epidemic. In addition, for customers booking trips to China and other impacted areas, the Coronavirus became a known event on January 22, 2020. Travel protection plans generally exclude losses caused by events that were known or foreseeable at the time the plan is purchased. Customers who purchased their plan prior to January 22, 2020 may still have coverage for a covered loss for a trip booked to China or other impacted areas.https:/…2019-novel-coronavirus.htmSo it's great that this works out for Reau, as someone said before, seems too good to be true.Edited: 6:22 pm, March 04, 2020 "
Delta just announced they will not be charging for flight changes on international flights in month of March. With United cutting back on even domestic flights it will be interesting to see how far the cutbacks go.
"I will keep my fingers and Lolo's paws crossed for you, Reau......I hope it's real too!All the airlines will be cutting domestic flights soon. Some of the sales are both to ""put on a happy face"" and to try and fill seats that have been cancelled already.I understand Vegas is taking a HUGE hit."
"COVAD-19 outbreak on Grand Princess cruise ship that called in at Kauai, Oahu, Maui and Hilo Feb. 26-29.https:/…"
"The infections apparently date to the ship going between Mexico and California....not Hawaii and California. The explanation is confusing, I can see why people are reading it wrong.There are some people on the ship who did both legs, and could be infected. No one stayed in Hawaii--but there could be people who were exposed and infected in Hawaii. It's a great example of how confusing and changeable things are with this."
"SW, I found this confusing, too. It does seem to indicate some passengers exposed to the index patient then made their way to Hawaii ports where they disembarked. Is that your reading?"
"2 confirmed cases from the sailing to Mexico62 passengers who were on the Mexico trip remained on board for the Hawaii sailing, plus unknown number of crew21 people currently aboard Hawaii sailing have symptoms"
"One of the two died, in California.I have seen different numbers....The crew member tested in Hilo weeks ago was cleared.Right now, one passenger is quarantined on the ship. Others (both crew and passengers) are being watched.Edited: 11:03 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"The ship was ordered to return to San Francisco. The governor of California, though, has directed the ship to remain at sea for the time being. The 62 passengers who were potentially directly exposed to the known victims have been directed to remain in their state rooms until medically cleared.What I don’t understand is why they wouldn’t be also quarantining all of the passengers who were potentially exposed during the Hawaii journey."
Because the 62 aren't showing symptoms?? Remember they have been exposed more than 2 weeks already. I think the reports are incomplete and don't think speculation is helping. I think we should all wait to see what better information comes out by tomorrow.
"With All the uncertainty can’t a girl get a great deal, right now, for travel in January 2021?Lol."
"SW I love you, but don’t appreciate being tagged as confused, “reading it wrong” and speculating by you. I have only relayed what is being reported in multiple news accounts and in primary documents readily available to anyone to read on the Princess web site and CA Gov statements."
"We've seen how well it works to quarantine people on a ship (Diamond Princess). I don't know how any virus can be contained where there is congregate living (the nursing home in Kirkland) -- or wherever you have HVAC circulating air (buildings, airplanes). Do we know if COVID-19 requires direct contact with individuals or surfaces?Edited: 11:29 am, March 05, 2020 "
I heard you can be within 6 feet of someone and it lives on surfaces for 4 days. I do not know if these are facts...I don't know what to believe anymore. These cruise ships need to be shut down for cleaning as well as the airline industry needs to step up and clean their birds better.
"Well, sorry to have offended you. But the fact remains that reports are still being sorted out. The first reports didn't say 62 people were infected...but that a total of either 21 or 23 were **suspected** due to symptoms they had. 11 were passengers and 10 were crew **according to most reports**. Your post made it sound like the 62 under ""watch"" must, must be infected and need to be quarantined. That's one reason I posted that we ALL need to wait.Sue, according to the CDC direct contact is not necessary. Droplets can infect people through the aerosol spread (such as sneezes or coughs).I don't *think* they have determined whether HVAC can spread it or not.I did some shopping yesterday, way before the news of the Grand Princess. Most shelves were fairly well stocked, thanks to barge and container schedules.However......one of the largest wholesalers on island has issued a notice that there won't be any more hand sanitizer delivered until at least the end of March. Other wholesalers are scrambling to find sanitizer and paper goods.I not only bought TP and paper towels (Kaeleku, betcha I got as much TP as you, LOL).....I got dog food, cleaning products (normal everyday ones), and misc items that I know won't be shipped if things get bad."
"I am in the shipping/container logistics for work. China is still backlogged with containers still out for deliveries on old bookings. There are shortages of containers everywhere and bookings are getting rolled or canceled because of blank sailings and no equipment. Hang on for a bumpy ride for a few months.Edited: 11:59 am, March 05, 2020 "
Looks like Canadian travel insurance companies are moving to disallow corona virus as a reason for cancellation. https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus…
"Yep, Sara--and here the effects are amplified quickly. Like I've told friends, there are many impacts that hit us harder and faster than the mainland.The mainland has multiple shipping corridors, routes, options, and companies. Not Hawaii. If the longshoremen in Oakland decide to use sick time.....we are screwed. If crews on container ships decide to sick out-for valid reasons or not--we are screwed. Air cargo also suffers, esp on neighbor islands.If it gets bad, only food (human) will get priority. But that also means there have to be crews in Hawaii to unload those ships or planes, and that any clearance procedures are fast and effective. Neither fast or effective are things Hawaii government is known for.After 09-11, ships that weren't allowed to dock in Honolulu sat in the channel. They dumped tons--many, many tons--of produce and perishables into the ocean as it spoiled on the ships. We didn't see fresh tomatoes on Maui for 2 1/2 months.........just one example."
Here's a pretty good and coherent summary about the Grand Princess and its visit to Hawaii:https:/…
"Been watching a 2 hour special on Hawaii News Now with interviews with all,the head honchos of the state. Governor, Lt.Governor, Director of the State Board of Health, Department of Transportation Head, State Board of Education Head. Now, all the head honchos, physicians of all the medical facilities. Very, very, informative. Don't know if they'll stream it later but this has more than answered many of my questions and confirms, denies and questions many of the statements made in this thread. If they do stream it I highly recommend watching it and get the most up to date info about what has, what will and what might happen in Hawaii in the near future!!"
"confirms, denies and questions many of the statements made in this thread.Lol, well that is helpful."
"LOL, Kaeleku. Moving targets are hard to hit.......whether they are in China, NY, Hawaii, Washington, or ___________.This is and will be a fluid situation. I trust the variety of sources I read far more than the ""head honchos"" of Hawaii government. I want to read a variety of information from a variety of source--as I posted in the very beginning. Again, everyone must make their own decisions. Base those decisions on the best possible info you can get, not just one or two sources. Make sure you stay away from the growing number of scams, too."
Very vague I know. I purposely did that because I won't get into pissing matches if I happen to impart something that wasn't quite right. It's better to go straight to the source instead of second hand information. Just wanted folks to be informed that this is going on and hopefully they'll be able to pick it up later. If not perhaps other states will do the same for their folks.
"My locality had a facebook town meeting with local health officials. In response to questions the public health officer said if you get sick with a mild fever and are ""doing ok"" there is really nothing they can do to mitigate the virus (ie no Tamiflu equivalent) so just stay hydrated and take fever suppressant. Stay home. Only call ER or doctor to arrange for safe screening if have breathing issues or fever keeps climbing."
"Yes, anyone who uses only one news source will be lacking info. It's good local officials are coming forth with information. Anyone could chose to believe it or not. The thing is now they are accountable and I thank them for doing their jobs."
"People can easily watch it right here:https:/…if they wish.There have been a number of 'bulletins' 'roundtables', ''discussions', etc., etc, ad infinitum. And there will be more. .......reliable or not.One of the biggest reasons I choose to disregard much of the ""expert advice"" from fish's source is easy: It's aimed at protecting tourism, not people. I encourage people to consider the *motivation* behind a source as well as the information posted by it/them."
My locality didn't imply there wouldn't be huge numbers of patients. Just that showing up in a pointless quest for treatment creates more patients.
"The markets are tanking again, very badly.Here's an interesting chart from the CDC (via CNN) about testing in the states:https:/…h_b1ca2826468942e0275ea2d6bb7a5053"
"SW, thanks for this thread. And thanks, friends for keeping it non-confrontational as SW asked. Coach has removed the OP on his COVID 19 thread. There were a variety of opinions on that thread & some good points made. I don’t want to turn this into an emotional thread or any kind of disagreement. But I do want to make the point I made in that thread. I hope it might stick, since earlier threads I posted OHare now gone too. So I’m going to repost my response here. I hope people will read the link in it. 83. Re: Some thoughts of Encouragement on Coronavirus HysteriaMar 5, 2020, 8:17 AMSave“ ...it’s when it’s an opinion piece and people have different opinions it will go sideways- especially when others can’t handle an opposing opinion or even facts.”Well said, TB4.Coach, sorry. I wish this virus would just go away. But it won’t.It can be a difficult balance to take it seriously without engendering panic. There is so much we don’t know. And so much at stake.Yesterday I read a thoughtful blogpost written by a doctor, an infectious disease epidemiologist, who had worked many years at CDC. Juliana Grant, MD MPH. Her purpose was to help people understand what to expect, to keep calm but to take it seriously.https:/…coronavirusThe line there that most hit home for me was this, “ It is likely that people you know will die from COVID-19.”My sister and a daughter-in-law fly on business several times a month. I have a son & another daughter-in-law who live in China. I have an 85 year old mother, one of the most vulnerable population.Our family in China is doing well. The Chinese government got on top of this quite quickly. Our kids are actually much more worried about us now. One of concerns is whether or not our trip to meet on Maui this summer will be able to happen...So... while doing my best to avoid panic, I, along with many others do feel some anxiety. A few jokes, especially political ones, can bring relief."
"Could we do some ""tirage""? Focus resources to protect the most at-risk population? Let's say these are people 60 and up and all individuals whose health is already compromised. It appears that younger people and those without serious health issues may contract the virus, but they largely survive without serious consequences. It doesn't seem that we can stop the spread, but could we keep it from infecting those most like to suffer the most serious consequences?Edited: 2:14 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Coach, your thread was clicked out by the clickers early today. Sue, how do you do that? Do you tell SW that she's not entitled to be tested--or receive medical care because she's healthy and under age (so to speak, LOL)? And how about the homeless? They are def in the ""most vulnerable"" group. Do they get treatment and testing for free while I. who pay for health insurance-doesn't?People also need to realize that many people have undiagnosed conditions. I know that well-it happened to me and nearly killed me twice, most recently only a few months ago. I had NO clue of my problem until it landed me in the ER. So the diagnosis of COVID-19 may mean ""more"" than it seems, for some people. For example, there are many times a person goes for a case of bronchitis...and is found to have lung cancer. Or a visit for an injured limb turns into the discovery of a rampant infection, or pancreatic cancer.I will never support rationing of health care, anymore than it already exists---because it does. But in this outbreak, we need people to seek medical care if they have the symptoms, to try to limit the spread in what small ways are possible. Cutting people off, or charging excessive amounts for test--means less viable information.Edited: 2:40 pm, March 05, 2020 "

"With limited resources we will HAVE to do 'triage' at some point. I'm not saying I know HOW, but we can't have millions of people in quarantine for very long. I was thinking more of who should be/could be sequestered. I'm glad I am not living in a nursing home or other congregate living, but how long should my DH and I stay away from other people -- like our DS and family? This virus could be active for many months. It's not realistic to have rolling quarantines, is it?"
"You are hitting the nail on the head. We need to delay and spread out the impact of this as much as possible. Otherwise ERs, hospitals and clinics get overwhelmed and the death toll rises sharply. However, still, as of 3/5 it appears that it is business as usual in the US. Flights still spreading it from region to region; schools, universities, nightclubs, gyms remain open ensuring plenty of young healthy spreaders propagate it to their vulnerable relatives; still no testing; top politician still pooh poohing and pretending media and experts in 60+ counties are all engaged in a conspiracy against him (narcissistic personality disorder) and his moron followers bravely proclaim nothing is happening; only 62,000 ventilators in a country of 325,000,000. This will totally end well."
"https:/…All passengers aboard the Diamond Princess have now been asked to stay in their rooms. Originally only the 62 who had been on the earlier sailing were confined to their rooms. As my earlier post clearly stated, “ The 62 passengers who were potentially directly exposed to the known victims have been directed to remain in their state rooms until medically cleared.” Article excerpt: “ Cruise ships are a unique environment when it comes to health concerns, according to the CDC. In an article on their website, the CDC says that, ‘Outbreaks on ships can be sustained for multiple voyages by transmission among crew members who remain onboard or by persistent environmental contamination.‘“"

"An email from American is posted below.Confidence when you buy and fly with AmericanYour safety and well-being is always our top priority at American Airlines, but particularly in relation to the coronavirus (COVID-19). Providing you with up-to-date information on what we are doing to respond to the issue is a critical step in giving you peace of mind when you travel. Here are a few highlights of our efforts: Travel flexibility We are extending our offer to waive change fees for customers who purchase tickets March 5 through March 31, 2020, for travel through January 30, 2021. This is available for any of American's nonrefundable published fares. See details for waived change fees. Enhanced cleaning We have a strong, structured cleaning regimen and our aircraft are cleaned each day at key touchpoints on their journeys with an EPA-approved disinfectant. We are also enhancing our cleaning procedures on international flights and aircraft that remain overnight at an airport. This move, which will touch the majority of our aircraft each day, includes a more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces, including tray tables and armrests. Also, most of our aircraft are equipped with High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters that provide a complete air change approximately 15 to 30 times per hour, or once every two to four minutes. A HEPA filter's complete air change is better than most other forms of transportation and office buildings’ and similar to the standard for hospitals. See more details. Ongoing efforts Our entire leadership at the airline is focused on the coronavirus issue and your well-being. We are working closely with the federal government, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many other health agencies to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep you safe and well-informed. We are confident that our incredible team of more than 130,000 will care for you in the best possible way during your journey with us."

"Good info, Hula - makes me feel a LITTLE better flying AA there in a couple of weeks......."
"AA -- and all vendors in any realm -- are 'doing all they can', which is virtually nothing better than issuing a rabbit's foot for good luck with every ticket sold. They are 'making an effort'. They're showing 'good faith'. It's PR. It's not 'all they can do', but all they can do without severely curtailing flights. You can barely collect debris and swab the toilets in an aircraft in the 20 minutes it's on the ground between flights. Forget focusing on international flights. The virus is *here* now."
"I believe that the airlines have to be proactive and are doing all they can - I don't want to be that cynical and believe its all PRIf they don't and it comes out that everyone's fears of planes being THE contributor for the spread lf the virus, than air travel will tank and I don't think the industry wants that.JMHO and YMMV"

We are ready to fly to Oahu/Maui in mid-July and I'm hoping in a few months things will be under control??? It's just a matter of time until we get our first case in CT as it has appeared in every state surrounding us. FWIW, we just had 7 people die in CT from the flu last week adding to the total of 65 flu deaths in CT this season. Safe travels to all!!"

They may want to contact airlines NOW and see what can be done. Ditto for talking to owners/agents of condos that are booked.I think the short term fee waivers etc are what I said before......they've had enough passengers cancel that they need to re-sell seats. But they can't just cancel flights without tanking the consumer confidence even lower. So instead they are offering free changes......and great sales at the same time, for the very same dates.PS--Yes, the ship passengers that were confirmed as ill had *not* been to Hawaii. I qualified my post last night because the info was, as I mentioned.....vague. There was some confusion about whether passengers had been taken off the ship and flown out, in fact.

"RyanI agree with what you say and am aware of the circumstancesjust ironic for us to see a pocket almost right where we are goingwe are flying through LGA and out of Bos after a road trip and both will probably be very crowded, but we shall see how things shake outthis might be the new normal"
"TB4, wishing you a great trip & safe journey. Hope you report on your traveling experience. I just left Maui 3 weeks ago...seems like much longer than that, now."
"According to twitter, it's in HI now, from the cruiseship"
"Yes, in Hawaii:https:/…"
"Yes, if you lookAt the GIS link someone else provided it now shows one in Oahu."
"First case reported in Danbury by the Hartford Courant today.Or, if you cancel, you will save yourself thousands more in expenses incurred during your visit."
"The Oahu case is a great example of how the state and federal governments have failed.The person returned from the cruise in the third week of February. So for over 2 weeks, that person has led their life and potentially infected ????? people?Pretty much what has happened all over the country....."
"SW, So unfortunately true. Current state boils down to testing (or lack thereof). Testing in California is so woefully behind the curve. Providers are pleading for testing. It is not happening. Welcome evidence that things are different here or elsewhere."
"Testing everywhere is ridiculously behind. So is tracking or being honest about numbers. So far, Italy wins my vote for most honest."
"I, too, have been watching Italy as an overall barometer/indicator. And Singapore which may be the gold standard on best response/management."
"Watching the 20/20 special and it addressed why test kits were slow in coming. The CDC didn’t get accurate reporting from China until mid Jan. And not an overwhelming number of companies that manufacture these tests. So there was a lag. And why even compare the US to Singapore?? “Singapore brings: a top-notch health system, draconian tracing and containment measures, and a small population that’s largely accepting of government’s expansive orders”We can weld ppl into their homes here. Or breach HIPPA laws to contain suspected cases."
"I'm really curious as to how the ""state"" failed in the case of the individual from the cruise ship."

Well aren't we just full of kindness and warmth this glorious morning that we are lucky to see!! So glad to have you join the Maui forum.
"I said in another thread.....I find it ironic that TA is referring people to the forums--when they've tried so hard to kill them.More people are cancelling, and more and more cases are and will be confirmed all over. Hawaii is behind the curve....but it won't last, IMO."
"The first case in my county was reported today and the she was on the previous Grand Princess Cruise. She apparently was at work and going about her life before she got sick, like anyone would.https:/…31269568"
"We have community spread cases here in Oregon. Very little testing, authorties are very tight lipped. Wonder how that approach will play out. I'm over 65, so in the risk demographic. Oh well, this outbreak should ultimately save the government money on medicare and social security expenses."
Just some thoughts & questions:Why haven't the homeless contracted the virus?Since all the attention to sanitizing and washing are there fewer flu cases and deaths?How many deaths from the flu have been reported verses corona during the same time period?
“ Why haven't the homeless contracted the virus?”Because they aren’t testing the homeless here in our grate kontry.
"Yeah... since “we” don’t want our numbers to double we don’t test.. if we don’t test, we don’t know. We can say all is well and we’ve done a great job. Ridiculous. Not."
"“ Why haven't the homeless contracted the virus?” What evidence indicates the homeless have not contracted the virus?""How many deaths from the flu have been reported verses corona during the same time period?"" How many cases were classified as influenza-like illness but were actually covid19?"
Wouldn't you think do to their living condition and drug use if the virus had reached the homeless population there wouldn't be a noticeable spike in deaths?
Good points Practicealoha. I’m pretty sure it is many places we don’t know. Unfortunately that makes it very hard because we can’t protect the people at risk this way. They really need to do a better job.
"Can we stick to Hawaii? And please not go to politics again? Please?Cases will increase as more and more people seek medical attention and tests are made available. But in Hawaii, they hope to be able to do 240 tests a week. That's not many. Tests are not available on Maui except through the hospital so far. Then the samples have to be sent to Oahu.While there is speculation that the homeless will be victims in large numbers, that may or may not happen in Hawaii. They live outdoors, away from things like schools, nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, airports, hotels, restaurants......you know, all the more common places people seem to spread this so easily."
"Thanks, TA! I appreciate you reinstating this thread.So, as many may know already, there has been a second confirmed case on Oahu. The man is elderly and has been referred to as ""critically ill"". He traveled to Washington state, and returned to Hawaii **after becoming sick**.........so he brought it with him. He went to a Kaiser clinic a few days after landing--but they didn't test him.He went home and ended up calling an ambulance a few days later. He is in ICU."
It has been confirmed that the second case (mentioned above) flew on Hawaiian Airlines. HA says they have thoroughly cleaned the plane he was on.I've not heard the status of the crew or other passengers on the flight.
"I wonder how many people flew on the plane before it was cleaned properly.....3 round trips? 4? 6?As I said in another thread, no one knows how many cases there are in Hawaii. I do know there have to be more than 2. Two simply doesn't make any sense, people."
I only posted the case in my town because originally our local news said her cruise returned from Hawaii. Now they are saying Mexico but all California to Hawaii cruises make a stop in Mexico but passengers don’t necessarily get off the ship.
"scincalifornia - great point. Cruises must stop at a foreign port ... if they fly a foreign (not US) flag. It's the law. (An old, weird, convoluted law.) Hence the ""Mexico-touchdown."""
"270 ·“I wonder how many people flew on the plane before it was cleaned properly.....3 round trips? 4? 6?”Here’s the thing about statements like this....this just perpetuates fear. We know COVID-19 is spread person to person-through droplets. Most viruses don’t last long on surfaces. The plane that person was on was not “infected” a virus needs a host to replicate-in this case, the narries or lungs of a person. While it possible that the people sitting close to him on the plane are at risk-those in subsequent flights were not. At most-the area where that person sat if droplets where present because the pt coughed-may have been contaminated for a short time. The person sitting there after the infected person would have have to touch the droplets then come intact with their face."
"It was 2 different cruises, SC.......and some people (and obviously crew) stayed *on the ship* for both cruises.They never made their mandatory Mexico or Canada stop after Hawaii, because by then they had been notified of the man dying in California.Italy has now implemented very strict travel limits, is closing its borders almost totally---and banned ALL public gatherings.US cases jumped more than a hundred so far today.........and it's early still.Marie......maybe you should read the CDC guidelines about planes. Several rows ahead and behind, plus side to side are the recs for cleaning. But here's the thing: Since that wasn't done to start with, and there could easily have been plenty of others on the plane...it's just a flying petri dish.Edited: 5:25 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"""We know COVID-19 is spread person to person-through droplets. Most viruses don’t last long on surfaces.""False. From the WHO: ""It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).""https:/…q-a-coronaviruses"

*aborted Hawaiian cruise*? The map in the article shows it stopped at all four major HI islands. Initial announcements by HI officials indicated the same.
"SC.....you really are missing it, sorry, I don't know what you are reading but it is totally wrong. TOTALLY. The cruise came to Hawaii.

Loving the cancellation waivers by airlines... I can tell you from first hand experience this week... if you contact the airlines directly... being nice goes a long way... you can often negotiate more than you would think.
Very encouraging to see airlines helping people make a health-responsible decision about travel. Sooner would have been better.
"Thanks, Herfnerd! Great info."
"As mentioned in another thread, the Department of Health has now done a contract with a private company in Texas. They will send test kits to any doctor. No word on how long it will take for those to reach doctors here. These tests will be sent back to Texas. Not counting shipping time, results will take 3 days. So total time will be around 5-6 days, between test and results."
"Testing and quarantine is key. Even here, now with drive in tests as of tomorrow, only people with Corona symptoms are testes. It is a pandemic with a virus that spreads so easily, that they only hope to delay it as much as possible to keep the medical system from completely breaking down as is already the case in Italy: 10000 confirmed infections, 600 deaths. Usually I feel blessed that we live a mere 3 hours drive from Italy. Not at the moment. My heart goes out to the people there. SW is right in mentioning that without Corona test, you will not know how much the virus has already spread and what the situation on Maui already is.As kids are almost not affected and the virus is worst for people over 60 and people with health issues, experts are concerned that kids might unnoticed (only mild cold symptoms) spread it to their grand parents. So among other measures (no concerts, sport events, several schools closed etc) they recommend kids should not visit their grand parents in the next couple of weeks. Nevertheless they expect that 60% of the populations will be affected by this virus. I really hope that Hawaii will not be affected by the virus as much as we are here in Europe. I doubt there are enough E.R. beds for all the people that might need one.Edited: 3:56 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Sternchen, I've seen some of the reports about Germany and all of Europe--very frightening and sad. It is so strange to see the photos of deserted Piazzas, squares, train stations, and stadiums.I posted about the lack of testing in another thread earlier today (in Hawaii). As of now.....a grand total of 19 people have been tested here in the **whole state**. Yes, 19. Our population is about 1.4 million, not counting tourists. The daily tourist average is around 260,000 people......and the State and DOH have done NINETEEN tests.The Department of Health proudly announced that they have reached a contract with a private company in Texas. Doctors can order test kits from this company. Once they get them, they can supposedly submit tests without limits like those that the DOH has been enforcing. Those tests have to be sent to Texas, and the results will take about 3 days. So....you are still looking at close to a week from the test to results---once we even get the kits."
"Hi SW! Sorry, but this sounds really bad. Only 19 tests and with the time required to get results is a joke for a virus that spreads so fast and easily.Refusing to notice that measures have to be taken will not slow the virus down.I have to admit that I did not take the virus that serious until recently when I realized how easy it spreads and how easily a medical system can come to its limits even in the western world.Edited: 4:25 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Hi back! It's very nice to see you, even over a very serious and sad situation.Yep, despite pleas from many doctors for 2 months now, the Department of Health wouldn't approve tests for nearly ALL potential victims. They had the only test kits, and they controlled the whole system for this. If a doctor's request didn't meet **their** interpretation of high enough risk.........no test.It worked-sort of. On paper, Hawaii only has 2 confirmed cases. Well, gosh, Hawaii looks downright safe and perfect!!! Come visit!!! Don't worry, be happy!!!If the new tests show what most of us expect, those numbers will change rapidly. And that won't include all the earlier cases or those misdiagnosed."
"Here's a good article describing the new policies............which are not totally new. Note that the State still controls quite a bit:https:/…Edited: 4:42 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Our leading politician in Bavaria summed it up nicely:„We hope for the best, we prepare for the worst. There is no reason for panic but for severe concern.“Sincerely hope authorities in Hawaii will come to the same conclusion and will take appropriate measures. Any attempts to neglect the virus to keep tourism up will not help in the long run but will make matters worse - for tourists and residents alike. All the best to you SW!"
Not everyone shares the same opinion that the authorities in Hawaii are doing anything differently than anywhere else in the US at this point. In fact we're in better shape than a lot of other states. They do have a right to be concerned about tourism. When that tanks we all go down.
"Thanks, Sternchen! My best wishes to you and your family, too :-).SW"
"On a slightly different side of this........all the vrbo/airbnb/expedia/homeaway/booking dot com. etc sites are really, really starting to cry about lost money and lost reservations.If you book a trip *now*, I would totally buy CFAR insurance. ......it will be expensive, but your only hope of recovering some of your money if you end up having to cancel.If you already have one booked, and are staying in a condo, private rental, etc. ( versus a hotel)........good luck. You might get a small amount back from some of them, but don't bet on it."
"Related to the panic or hoard buying that has happened (all over).....Target has now announced they will start limiting purchases of ""key"" items. You can bet that includes TP, disinfectants and wipes, and paper towels. I believe it takes effect this weekend. IMO, they should have just *done* it, not announced it ahead. You can bet that people will be charging to Target even more the next few days."
"Under what circumstances would a trip in 2 weeks canceled? My main concern would be a quarantine and not being able to get back to work.Edited: 8:39 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"<""Under what circumstances would a trip in 2 weeks canceled?"">A travel ban? A lot has changed in Italy in the past 2 weeks ... if you're following the stories about it, it will give you an idea of what could happen anywhere where extreme measures need to be taken to keep the virus from spreading."
"Do you mean cancelled by an authority or your airline? Like Susan said, it *could* happen but pretty rare.You could cancel for a number of reasons. On this end....not so many."
"I was busy, and didn't post this from a conference a while ago. Wow, the State is up to 22 tests now (including the 2 confirmed cases). Compare to Colorado with hundreds in less than a week, California with thousands, ditto for NY.https:/…At least they seem to be edging more into reality."
"A little more info:""The tests will be conducted by the State Laboratories Division in Pearl City and will enable the state to identify and notify people who test positive and take action to try to stop the spread of the virus, officials said. Health officials will contact the provider and patient in the event of a positive result and provide further guidance.The Laboratories Division expects to receive up to 400 samples a week from participating healthcare providers and will randomly select and test 200 of these for COVID-19 testing....""200 random is better than zero.....but they should be testing all 400. The samples are coming from suspected people."
Doesn't say where in Hawaii this doctor was but they tested positive after their triphttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/covi…
"SW aren’t they randomly testing samples from screenings for garden-variety influenza? I’m not sure everyone screened for basic influenza would be deemed suspicious for COVID19.  Either way Hawaii’s strategy is smart, look for other states to follow suit."
What are the reports from hospitals in Hawaii regarding increased admissions? Beds available in ICU? Respirators available? Isolation units?How are patients and staff in nursing homes being monitored?
"QuailfromCan, Thanks for that link. Wow! A doctor in her 30's caught the virus, so for all of those saying ""hey, I'm in my 50's and healthy"" don't think you can't get it too. She obviously got the virus in Hawaii and brought it back home, to her cancer patients unfortunately."
"Sue, for Wilcox here on Kauai there have been no increase in admissions. They and all hospitals in Hawaii have started screening everyone coming into the hospital.  They already have isolation units and capacity to expand it. Staff go through a yearly physical examine and rigorous testing for known diseases. They all have been briefed on what to look out for and know what they should do should they start exhibiting symptoms."
"Maui Memorial has had protocols in place for weeks now. Will they work? Who knows..just like anywhere and everywhere, this is a changing situation every day. They are doing the best they can and so are other health care facilities.The Canadian doctor.........has anyone realized that she could have brought it with her? The incubation period is such that she could well have landed in Hawaii while asymptomatic, based on the limited info provided so far. Perhaps that will be disproven as more information comes out. She also could have gotten it on the plane(s).............Yes, the 400-ish tests a week are for flu first-then if it it negative, 200 of those will be selected for more testing. I see I'm not the only person who thinks this is Russian roulette, HI govt. style. Several state reps and others are also calling for more tests *period*. The cute name doesn't change the fact that Hawaii is far behind in testing people. Other states have been doing many more tests for up to 2 months now. They didn't name them.........they just did them."
"WHO finally declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. It's overdue, by at least a month, in many people's opinions. What does it mean? Well, the biggest takeaway should be that it will keep spreading and affect every country/state/locale/ etc....except maybe Antarctica. Will it crush tourism? No, but it will severely hurt it, all over. Germany believes they will see a 70% infection rate, and they have had more aggressive containment practices in place already. As Hawaii gets more cases and the gubbermint continues to play ostrich in the sand, we will get a ***worse*** reputation than we would have if they'd been honest.Some layoffs have started, mostly on Oahu. Like after 09-11, this will have a gradual climb. The cuts will be less noticeable at first, then larger. Businesses that were already on the edge will go under. Housing will prob fall about 20-30%....but not right away. If you decide to visit Maui-or Hawaii, or anywhere--during this, please be informed. Follow the recommended practices and procedures. Don't risk yourselves if possible, or the people around you who have no control over *your health*. Don't cough in my face, for example.......really."
It really is a larger issue. Larger than Hawaii tourism or losing a deposit. The only thing that will limit the growth rate and the eventual end is social distancing and hygiene. We have no vaccine or even effective antivirals. Individual actions matter to the world. Hard to believe but watch the last 30 seconds of this https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg
"Housing falling back 20-30%??? Do you mean prices?? We have some friends who bought In Maui (Wailea GC) in 2008 less than 400K, they were living there at the time, they now have 5 condo's + their house. I wish we had bought then as well.Edited: 2:30 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Yes, I mean prices. Your friends better have one heck of a cushion, BTW. With falling tourism, comes falling rentals....and that is just how many people scooped up ""bargains"" from about 2008 to 2012 or so. Oops........now what? No tourists, no pay mortgage, no have 5 condos anymore...........Here's a decent article from the Maui News about the hospital's capability:https:/…which highlights how MANY hospitals will not have enough room for a larger outbreak, not just Maui or Hawaii.And here is a poorly written and totally inadequate article about a suspected case at OGG:https:/…LOL..you almost can't tell whether the couple was positive or not..whether they are still being ""held"" or not........whether they were tested properly or not.... gawd.Edited: 2:36 pm, March 11, 2020 "
30% and I'm in... I'll just move there... not holding my breath yet.
"You might want to read the Top Question I did about moving to Maui.......It will likely take about 8 to 12 months for the real estate market to fall in the *median* range. Very high end won't change much, and neither will very low. But the middle range will bounce around and find its low point after the dust settles. Seen it plenty before, each cycle :-).Back on topic.....people are asking about things closing. Still none that I know of--and I doubt we will see any yet. The main tourist activities and places will do everything possible to stay open. As numbers drop, they may do like after 09-11---cut things to four days a week instead of 7, close earlier or open later (restaurants and shops), etc.Keep in mind that mid April starts to slow down, too. Things are generally fairly slow until the third week of June.Edited: 5:17 pm, March 11, 2020 "

A European doctor's perspective on why even the young and unafraid should stay put#bendthecurvehttps://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
"@Honu: very good article that describes the situation in Italy and Europe quite well. And yes, even if they say most younger people or kids are not affected severely, there are exceptions, like a 2 year old in Berlin with Corona virus now in intensive care. Worse even for people over 65. Estimation by an acknowledged virus expert of the Charite Berlin: up to 25% fatality rate for this age group. I have to admit that even 4 weeks ago, when we returned from our trip to Hawaii, I did not take the virus that serious, even though I belong to a risk group (asthma). Seeing what is going on in Italy, started in Germany and most likely will be the situation in the US within the next weeks my view of the situation changed dramatically. I believe neither of our health systems is prepared and will be able to cope with the number of patients severely affected if we are not able to slow the spread of the virus. Apart from the travel ban for Europeans to the US, even if we had a trip coming up, I would not fly anywhere at the moment. I know this situation is hard for businesses and especially for the tourist industry and I believe it will get worse, but a life weights more in my opinion than any business."

As I mentioned in another thread...Disneyland is closing until March 31st. There haven't been any cases there---they are being proactive.If they see the writing on the wall..........maybe more people will too?
Posted on the other thread as well:We were planning to come next week however British Columbia's chief medical health officer just announced the recommendation to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Very disappointed to cancel the trip and have no idea at this time if we will be refunded over $8000 in accommodation costs. We do have cancellation insurance but obviously doesn't apply as we are not sick. Perhaps Canada will add the US to the travel ban as that is the only way we would see that money again.
"Mountain, I also asked in the other thread----where are you booked?"
A condo through Ali'i Resorts.
Contact them See what they will do in the way of a change or credit for a future stay.
"The ""drive up"" testing I mentioned earlier has gone live on Oahu:https:/…"
Viking Cruises is also suspending cruises until at least May 1st.Disney World is also closing:https:/…
"A first, very sad----but necessary. The Merrie Monarch has been canceled."
"Wow. TWELVE ICU beds at Maui Memorial. But they can transfer patients to Honolulu, 'where there are more beds'. (And more people.) I wonder where the hospital has stashed this supply of 'additional staff' to be recruited if necessary. I suppose you have to say *something*."
"Wanted to add that this isn't 'bashing Maui Memorial'. Every hospital will be strained, but especially those more remote, with fewer resources upon which to draw -- including a limited pool of qualified workers. Whatever became of the branch posited for West Maui?"
So we officially have a national emergencyhttps:/…index.html
"As I posted in another thread, here's what should scare some people into sense:More than 350 people in the state have been identified (as of early last week, like almost 2 weeks ago) as potential COVID-19 cases.32 of them have been tested. Yes, not a typo---THIRTY TWO.So.........what's the exponential growth from the untested people? How many were/are positive? No one knows. How many tourists have incubated it and brought it with them? No one knows.None of the health care facilities in Hawaii can handle an epidemic. Zero. But our govt. refuses to even see the basic need, much less the road ahead."
I know for a fact there are arrangements being made here in Hawaii for alternatives in case the hospitals become full. This was done weeks ago. Trumps actions today will make that even easier. They run the gambit of setting up field hospitals to the Navy and Coast Guard setting up hospital ships off shore.
"Yes, of course. But then all those people have to be cared for and managed too--including *tested* themselves. The scenarios are so much larger than people understand."
"Hi There,Thank you for this information. Can you please help offer some insight into my questions? My hubby and I love Hawaii--we actually met there many many moons ago. We have a trip planned March 27 and, of course, have some questions.1.Is your island still receiving regular shipments of necessary supplies--disinfectants, bleach, toilet paper, food, etc?2. Is your hospital still receiving necessary supplies--antibiotics, masks, gloves, etc.?3. If people become ill on the island where are they being asked isolate? Are they allowed to go outside?Thanks again, Kara"
"Where are you from""Again:More than 350 people in the state have been identified (as of early last week, like almost 2 weeks ago) as potential COVID-19 cases.32 of them have been tested.

But our govt. refuses to even see the basic need, much less the road ahead.****************************************************************We don't even know how many cases we have. We do not have enough disinfectant and other supplies, and some are back ordered for more than a month out already. No, our hospitals do not have enough supplies or personnel to cover an extended period like a month or more. No one has been quarantined here yet--see above. No one knows what the govt. will do when they have to do that. You could well be taken to an isolated facility."
"Thanks to 3 Chi...........NCL has also suspended all cruise now, until April 11th.This includes the Pride of America interisland cruise."
"Many more closures starting to come in now. Most are on Oahu, some on other islands. Maui's are small events that most tourists don't go to anyway.The PCC (Polynesian Cultural Center theme park) on Oahu is closing until the end of March (so far). That's a first, IIRC. Museums are also starting to close."
"Yes, supplies are still coming in but the demand is having a hard time keeping up with it. I haven't seen any hand sanitizer in weeks, no rubbing alcohol, limits on how much you can purchase on everything you mentioned. Very much like the mainland. Haven't had any problems getting my medications here on Kauai. Food isn't a problem, certain brands might be. Oahu has a plan for quarantined visitors (not in the hotels for sure) but I don't know what the neighbor islands are doing in that regard."
Ummmm......********MAUI*********has had hand sanitizer off and on until just this Wednesday. Some store might get it back in by early next week.We have also had rubbing alcohol available every day.........on MAUI.
"I forgot, Bath & Body had sanitizer yesterday, too (Thursday):https:/…Costco ran out of TP this morning--but then restocked. Maybe Kaua'i just isn't as efficient as Maui, fish!"
"I posted this in another thread, but people should know that Maui County pools, gyms, sports facilities, community centers, and public restrooms at all parks will be closed for at least a month."
"I have an email from the agency we employ to look after our condo and our guests. They represent hundreds of condos in South Maui (and some on Kauai). The president of Condominium Rentals Hawaii says they are allowing people to cancel reservations and re-book later in the year -- no penalties. The original cancellation policies will be in effect for the re-booked reservations. My home state, Illinois, has just closed down virtually *everything* but emergency operations, at least until the end of March. My DIL will be teaching her 7th and 8th grade students in the Chicago Public School system from home. My DGD and DGS will be learning from home. My DH has gone to our public library this morning to 'stock up'. They will close down this afternoon. He is the 'step and fetch-it' for us.Better LATE than never!"
"Ref my post about the Mayor's announcement yesterday---after a few hours of pushback about the restrooms at beach parks, he changed that. The bathrooms at beach parks will be open. Of course, you should plan on bringing your own soap and I'd prob have TP too.....2 tourists on Kaua'i were confirmed late last night to have COVID-19."
"Trump has just announced he is thinking of banning domestic travel today just as my son travels in an empty United Airlines flight to Maui against my wishes as his friends Doctor parent paid for the flight and trip for FREE! Totally did my best to restrain him, but he is an adult and my wife didn't support my suggestions on NOT going during a global Pandemic. he might get some very bad response there when he states he is from INFECTED California and INFECTED LAX airport!"
"I head the prez say the same thing. He also said from ""hot spots"" Time will only tell and then it might be too late."
"Yeah, trump said that days ago. The travel ban has been extended to Britain and Ireland (to the US)."
Domestic travel ban soon according to Trump today!
"Can you post a link to a source for your claim? Again--he threatened that days ago. Haven't seen anything new, maybe I missed it.Here's some more info from the Maui News. Note that the two tourists on Kaua'i with COVID-19 weren't even included in the State's testing claims....does that scare anyone? It should. Also note the testing rules and locations here on Maui:https:/…"
"I am suppose to travel 3/25 with my son...but I am concerned about what's happening in Maui (and if it's anything like the bay area—empty shelves). If there aren't supplies, and food, or if restaurants are closed, then it wouldn't make sense to travel. Thanks!"
"As several of us have posted.....for the MOST part, supplies are fine. Also, no major tourist activities have closed .......***yet***. Will they close soon? Very possibly.Restaurants and shops so far are all open like usual. What it will be like by the 25th is something no one knows."
The 2 new cases on Kauai were on Maui first.....and were not allowed tests bythe State.
"Yes, the way it was worded was ""interesting"" sw. ""On March 12, case A was seen at Wilcox Memorial Hospital and at that setting they informed the healthcare professionals they had close contact with an individual that was COVID-19 positive."" Interpretation A: Tourists with close contact with covid case decided to travel here anyway. After all, it is mild, they are young and will be ok, and they are special and cannot be inconvenienced. As multiple posters are writing in.Interpretation B: Tourists who didn't know they had covid traveled here, spread it around, saw multiple doctors, and finally lied (""yes, we were in contact with a covid case"") to force a covid test.Either way, 1) a covid case went through multiple doctors without being detected because there is no testing and 2) tourists should not be coming to Hawaii, period.Edited: 7:07 pm, March 14, 2020 "
I'm going with B. It was just a matter of time until patients started providing false information in order to get tested. One more thing for health care workers to contend with.
What I think happend is by the time they got to Wilcox Hospital (Kauai) they were met at the entrance by screeners. This has been protocol for days now. They either told the screeners of their contact with an infected person and/or the screeners flagged them. Isolated in a place provided by the county and tested the next day. Still in isolation but not hospitalized.
It would make it easier to cancel if condo's could be refunded. Hard when you have saved for so long for a trip and now you are out thousands.
568 confirmed cases in WA state as of today
"Sunshine, you are right. Tough position for vacationers and rental owners alike. But prospects for a carefree vacation are not looking good. If what you deposited is non-refundable, whether you go or not, you've already taken a financial hit. Going and dropping thousands more will not put you further ahead."
"Here's a better article than some of the initial ones, about the new cases. It's still confuzzing but not quite as much:https:/…I think they had contact back home, and brought it with them. It incubated nicely while they spread it with such ALOHA on the planes, hotels, restaurants, clinics, etc. What a deal--bring your own virus to Maui and Kaua'i, great story to tell all your IG and FB friends!!!!!! Awesome and sooooooo cool!!!!!!!!ETA: In case people miss it, the last two sentences were sarcastic.Edited: 10:45 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Geez.Presumably the health care workers in isolation were from Wilcox? What about the urgent care providers on Maui and Kauai?
"No, 2 on Maui and one on Kauai as things turned out. Not that we can afford to lose any medical people either."
"#379. Right? Just read most recent Mauinow which says contacts were Mar 4, 7, 9 and 12...so four presentations resulted in how many individual contacts with registration, ancillary staff, nurses, providers?"
And another case on Oahu.

Government officials finally have there message right about the virus. When you layer a spike of coronavirus patients on top of seasonal flu our health system will break.

But she did. She stayed at the Royal Lahaina and ""self isolated"": until she went to a medical clinic Gosh...I'm sure she didn't infect any co workers, passengers, employees at hotels, etc, right????? Sure. I have a bridge to Oahu if you buy that.They are keeping our schools closed through the end of the month so far. They are asking ALL companies and even government agencies to have people work from home if at all possible. They are cancelling concerts, shows, etc. They continue to claim it's not really a problem here in Hawaii. Sure. I have a bridge to San Francisco for sale too."

"Good advice. Airbnb has done the right thing by allowing cancellations outside their regular contract. VBRO has not yet done the right thing, and at the moment, their clients are left with no recourse but to seek restitution from whatever insurance they might have.

Very sad that even tonight, some people just want to fight, argue, and/or cause trouble. Can't they grow up???"
"SW, assume your last question was rhetorical. ""the airlines and government continue to send very mixed messages."" The level of obfuscation coming from Gov Ige rivals that of the White House. Hopefully arrivals will continue to slow so the State can focus its attention on the needs of residents."

"I see no reason to call the governor names no matter how mild. It serves no purpose. I don't call him anything but governor Ige. The use of ""we"" doesn't include me.

"There should be more results from the private labs soon. I expect we'll see many more cases this week.Many restaurants on Maui are starting to limit hours and/or consider how to stay open or do take out only. As other cities close restaurants, bars, and more--Hawaii has to grapple with it too.The State Judiciary issued new policies yesterday, which followed a milder announcement a couple of weeks ago. DMV is closing offices and/or limiting people allowed in. Haleakala has closed all visitor centers (both the summit and Kipahulu), and Pearl Harbor is closed.

Hawaii will be on lockdown soon. Governor has asked tourists to stay away for 30 days. https:/…People without symptoms are a major source of COVID-19 spread. Angry residents are talking about picketing the airports starting tomorrow. Your vacation may endanger our elderly and those with health conditions. Time to reschedule your trip.
Hawaii residents are pushing for 14-day quarantine for all arriving passengers. Demonstrations at airports started today.
Here's a good article about traveling to Maui-or anywhere in Hawaii--right now. I wish people would read it and realize that this is how many residents feel. We are increasingly worried as cases increase and the lack of leadership from the governor continues. Our hospital simply can't handle a major outbreak.........and neither can the other limited resources available.STAY HOME. https://medium.com/@serenegunnison_78499/thinking-about-traveling-to-hawaii-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-don-t-57211a515862Sorry the link doesn't collapse.

"""My greater concern is where did the 2 stay who went to Kauai? ""This was answered a few days ago in an article on Hawaii News Now:Here’s what we know about their itinerary:The two traveled from Indiana on a direct United Airlines flight to Maui on March 2.They stayed in Kaanapali from March 2 to 8. Shortly after their arrival, however, one of the visitors developed a fever, shortness of breath and cough. That visitor went to an urgent care facility.On March 7, the second visitor also started developing symptoms and went to urgent care.A day later, both of the visitors flew to Kauai on Hawaiian Airlines Flight 149.They’ve been on Kauai since then, and were staying at the Kauai Marriott until being placed in an isolation facility provided by the county.Ige said that on March 9, one of the visitors — the first to get sick — visited an urgent care facility on Kauai. The visitor was prescribed antibiotics.Then, on Thursday, the visitors went to Wilcox Medical Center. At that point, the two informed health care workers that they’d had close contact with an individual who had tested positive for coronavirus."
"I meant where did they stay ON MAUI. I remembered though that they stayed at Marriott Ocean Club........LOL, in fact I posted that a week or so ago. Too much going on sometimes!We still have no info on the latest case."
true in fact I read an article about the hidden costs of the virus in the loss of productivity of people at work spending so much time on social media talking about the virus
"Yes, was just pointing out the article said they stayed in Ka'anapali. So didn't understand the comment about Grand Waliea cover up?"
"My mistake :-). I'll remove it..............no need to worry about GW's reputation, LOL.I guess some people aren't very efficient, john!PS--MS, is GW cancelling their luau yet?Edited: 2:26 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Don't forget that almost ALL travel between the US and Canada is coming to a halt..........if you have flights going either direction you need to check now.Also remember that only the Feds can order flights to be shut down. States can't on an extended basis (like COVID-19 concerns).
"AkamaiNick4SW, I can't answer any questions about the GW's activities. I have lived locally for decades and am not employed in any aspect of the tourism industry nor am I associated with investments in any vacation rentals.

Thanks for asking. GW did send me a nice offer today since it's cold and raining here I'm seriously considering being poolside tomorrow.
"And all those great discounts from airlines, hotels, and even management companies are a huge part of the problem.We desperately need people to stay home--and not visit. Our hospital is almost full already, has been. We don't have the infrastructure or the personnel to support a large outbreak. Trilogy also just cancelled all tours for the next two weeks. Slowly the tourist companies are waking up."

"@Fireball I'm reading this thread and really enjoying it! :) We have an up-coming trip that will likely be canceled/postponed.It's probably in the thread further along but now we have the border closed between Canada and the US except for supply and essential travel.

"Hey SW I hope you're doing well (and your family and everyone).March 18, Canada will limit international passenger flight arrivals to four airports (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary). WestJet said yesterday they were suspending commercial operations for all international and transborder lights Sunday March 22 11:59 pm. Three days ago we were told to postpone or cancel non-essential travel outside of Canada. This includes cruise ships. Everyone is supposed to self-isolate for 14 days upon return from travel outside of Canada. BC has been declared a state of emergency. Vancouver as well. My opinion is that this is too little too late and that borders should have been shut a long time ago. Testing in BC is only for three groups: 1. travel to specific countries 2, healthcare worker 3 long-term care residents (does not include social spread)I think Trudeau asked people to return to Canada quickly. Lots of ""snowbirds"" will need to return. That's it in a nut-shell though I didn't really answer your question. There is information all over the place. Maybe someone else is able to answer you more specifically; I find lots of information kind of all over the place.While we had delays in responding to this pandemic, the very unfortunate delays in the US have been alarming at best (no, I won't get into that). So, hopefully people in Maui and elsewhere are able to return really quickly. Wishing you well. I think this is a good thread as we can be updated in one thread which is great so thanks to everyone who has been keeping everyone informed; much appreciated.Stay well."
"Thanks!Very good info--it has been kind of confuzzing sometimes between ""Maybes"" and ""it's ON"", LOL.The ""mandate"" from the guv isn't, even now. But at least some people and businesses are taking it more seriously since he changed his wording some."
