is it safe with the coronavirus to travel to tromso Norway were going march 16 for one week
"It is impossible for us to predict if is safe or not. It depends on who you interact with during your travels, and if they have the virus or not. Airports abroad and large crowds are the highest risk."
Would you personally still go on holiday
The decision is yours and yours alone. No one can make that decision for you.
"Update your profile with location and perhaps we could give you some informed opinion.Right now I wouldn't hesitate travelling around Norway, but that might change tomorrow. As of now your biggest risk is airports and particularly flights where you are in close contact with others from goodness knows where."
"I live in Norway, and I'm not at all worried. You shouldn't be either. Look forwards to your holiday, Norway is truly beautiful!"
"I live in Norway too, I am not overly worried as I can take a bout of flu, but I have also had flu on holidays a couple of times and that was no fun at all !! And there is a risk of being quarantined and that would be even less fun. And the decision may be made for you in the end as more and more flights are being cancelled.Each and everyone needs to think through what kind of risk they are willing to take. Postpone if you find that more reassuring. Norway is not running away anytime soon.Edited: 4:35 am, March 06, 2020 "
Thanks everyone

"Just stay home!!! This is a word problem not just China or Italy! So staying at home is the only way to get rid of this nightmare! Everybody JUST STAYS HOME! I’m living in Oslo and the situation is underestimated: soon will come also here strong restrictions. To go around just spreads the virus. Is this hard to understand? Thanks, Pietro."
"“Just stay home”? How do you plan to get food, go to work or obtain medical care or supplies if everyone stays home Pietro?"
Ask to the Italians how their are living now. It is not impossible if you forget your personal needs and your egoism. We all need to make some sacrifices for the welfare of everybody otherwise this will be never over. Is that clear enough?
"Pietro, i understood your post to mean ‘your home country’. And I do agree with you that travelling for pleasure is possibly something we should not be doing. The infection rate seems to be escalating and many seem to be those who have travelled to Italy or been in contact with Italian travellers.I’ve cancelled 2 holidays and will be staying in the UK. Holidays can always be taken at a later date."
"As of this afternoon Norway is in official lockdown, all arriving from destinations outside the Nordic countries are facing a 14 day quarantine."
"Valid from today:https:/…Travel• We want domestic transport to continue as normal as possible but we strongly encourage everyone to avoid leisure travel• We encourage everyone to avoid journeys that are not strictly necessary (both domestic and international), avoid public transport if you can, avoid other places where you can easily get close to others, avoid close contact with others.• Everyone who comes from outside the Nordic countries should be in quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. Retroactive from 27 February."
Many thanks for the information.Do you know how that works in practise? Will there be a form to fill when people arrive? Will they be forcibly put in quarantine or is it expected that people will be responsible on their own? I understand that people should postpone their trip (and I suppose airlines will inform their passengers as such) but some may already in a plane.And do you know what happens with travellers who are currently there and arrived after Feb 27th? (I'm thinking particularly of Hurtigruten guests).
"I don't know, Soph. Currently the authorities don't have capacity to force people in quarantine, hence they put the responsibility on the travelers themselves. Let us see how this develops."
"Thanks Pippi. Sorry, that was a bit of a stupid question given that these are such extraordinary circumstances. Hopefully this will help Norway and its people.I'm expecting similar measures will follow in other countries (including mine)."
"> Will they be forcibly put in quarantine or is it expected that people will be responsible on their own?---that's the point: there's no adhoc infrastructure anywhere for enforcing the self-isolation rule/wish ... this would require that border police do track and watch people, locals or travelers, entering in.I was last friday until yesterday in Sankt-Peterburg, and similar measures were discussed, and actually Moscow mayor passed a local directive where most western-yuropan countries where listed as potentially risky, Norway included, and arriving travelers are supposed to go into 14-ine or if shorter stay, for the whole of it, like keep themselves in their hotel. But... in practice, nothing has changed at arrivals in moscovite airports. So...Yet Russia, which shares a long border with China, did implement at once an almost hermetic sealing of it, with few people allowed entry after sanitary border control, as soon as China informed of the epidemic. It worked, because indeed the country wasn't affected at all. The measure there was to not let people in, instead of letting in with a dubious self-isolation requirement. And, ironically first case was last week with a moscovite returning home from holidays in ... Italy. Russia can put in action quite some numbers of law enforcement and military people in order to implement a tracking and follow-up of travelers entering the country, and while it may happen, by now there's nothing more than the text of the directive.Comparatively how Norway may ensure that people will do 14-ine seems even less plausible. Makes no sense. what puzzles me quite is that Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, are the main countries with very long borders with China, and well I know well Almaty, it has a huge amount of chineses, there's the motorway and the high-speed train to Urumqi in Xin-Jiang, very important share border trade zone and travels. Yet all these three countries kept the epidemic away.Instead It has propagated at a dramatic level in ... Italy, which is now the worst cluster. The first case in Russia, as said, was a guy returning from Italy, and the other day the first case in Mongolia (which is bordering China!) was a french arriving from Paris through Moscow.so I have serious doubts about the western-yuropans elites..."
"I work in an offshore service company here in Norway and the retroactive quarantine regulation is chaotic at the moment, we are still at work trying figure this out. We have many commuters on our rigs at the moment, most of them from the UK.This is to be continued..."
"From what I read, Hurtigruten passengers may not go ashore unless they are actually disembarking at the very port. So passengers without symptoms are more or less quarantined on the ship. In case of contamined passengers onboard, I suppose the ship will be held in a suitable port.We are supposed to self-quarantine, but there are no measures to check that we actually do. The authorities appeal to solidarity, no big deal for me, I am at home, but I doubt tourists who have paid good money to go to Norway will confine themselves to their hotel room.We are also supposed to be fined if we break the quarantine, but it is not said by whom. In short, we are not really prepared for this kind of emergency situation."
""" In short, we are not really prepared for this kind of emergency situation."" I don't think anyone is unfortunately.Thank you for all your views on the situation."
"Some answers to my own questions, with news from Hurtigruten travellers (on a FB group). It seems that passengers in planes arriving in Oslo today after 6pm are not allowed to disembark until they choose either to go back home or quarantine in Oslo. However passengers who arrived today before that were totally unaware of what was going on (and some don't seem to understand that they are expected to self-quarantine now)."
"> we are not really prepared for this kind of emergency situation."" I don't think anyone is unfortunately.---the point is that european governments were not taken out of bed !Fact is that this started in central China in december, chineses informed about it, reacted quite fast and let in WHO. Countries with the main borders with China, ie. Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan took measures also at once and were not infected (Kazakhstan is still not, will not last though...). Moscow is a major airlines hub for the China-Europe tourism, but nothing reached there.Then the disease popped out in ... Italy. And the situation in western Europe propagated from there (in Norway, people getting sick back from italian holidays, alpine skiing and cities tourism). The recent cases in Russia and Mongolia have arrived not from China, but from Italy and France respectively, which questions the way the governments of the Schengen-zone have been evaluating the risk.The russians certainly didn't except the pandemic to jump in from the shiny, witty, superior EU/EEA, while they had it under control by their own border with China! So now they have cancelled many routes from/to France, Germany, Spain, besides of course Italy where delivery of russian visas has been suspended. Now USA cancels european flights.Meanwhile norwegian government is still unclear about its borders. And I am laughing: Solberg has declared people who have traveled outside the Nordic since Feb 27 must self-quarantine 14-days. That's my case: i came back from Russia yesterday, and while I was there, they were considering couple days ago if they were or not going to put Norway on a ... ban list ! there are today >700 cases in Norway for a population the size of Sankt-Peterburg vs. >30 cases for the whole Russia ...."
"I was planning to come Tromso from the UK, for 3 days. Apparently I need to be put in quarantine from 14 days of my return. How is this possible if I’m only there for 3 days? Where will they force us to stay? I have booked hotels and fjords sight seeings"
"You should seriously consider postponing your trip to a later date. Basically Norwegian authorities are asking international travellers to not travel in Norway at the moment, so as not to spread the virus, so please be responsible and stay home."
You should not travel to Norway at this time. If you do you must be in self quarantine in your hotel room. Not worth it! Please read reply #14 in this thread. It has all the details you need to know.

"Frank Nilsen, please do not spread unsubstantiated rumors (and at this rate it's pretty much spamming). No one knows how the epidemic is going to evolve and how long it will last."
"> Frank Nilsen, please do not spread unsubstantiated rumors. No one knows how the epidemic is going to evolve and how long it will last. actually what he is refering to are articles in the press about the current period being the 2-nd step in a 5-step process which should have at its peak ~700.000 infected (infected, not seak) and which will last until autumnfor instance this kind of national press articlehttps:/…dette-er-fasene-av-pandemienmaybe this itself is unsubstantiated, but FACTS are that everything on this side of Europe shows a lack of competence from the ruling elites in the first place, so everyone is in the dark, rumors or not.(subtantiated evidence about the lack of competence of authorities:- China warned, kept updated and got WHO inside since the beginning in **december** - the main neighbouring countries of China assessed the risk at once and took strong measures, so the virus didn't spread westward in a progression China-Russia/Mongolia/Kazakhstan-Europe, land borders and airports hubs being sealed and/or strongly controlled on that path. Have a look at a map.- instead it popped out in northern Italy end January. Still not known how.- Italy, ie. the Schengen-zone, ie. included Norway had by then good knowledge of the situation and havoc in China and Korea, and yet from Italy it has spread elsewhere, even, hahaha, eastward, backpedaling, to Russia and Mongolia, which were free for infection until few days ago.)the only practical point for travelers is then: stay away, cancel plans until autumn, swallow the loss."
"""the only practical point for travelers is then: stay away, cancel plans until autumn, swallow the loss"".Very sad, as we have a 2 month trip planned for May and June in 6 northern European countries - Germany, Poland, Norway, Finland, Russia and Iceland.Most of the cost will be refunded, I hope, by airlines and through the booking sites - booking.com and hotels.com I feel very sad about the impact that this will have on people who run small tourism businesses in Europe. Not much is currently said about them, but the impact for many will be devastating. I would be happy to not claim a refund from some of them. Yet is the shareholder owned airlines who are crying out for state aid."
All Norwegian airports shut down Monday morning (16/3) at 0800.Same goes for Norwegian ports. All Norwegian residents are asked to return home asap. All borders except for the Swedish (as long as it lasts) are closed. So visitors should try to leave Norway as soon as possible while you still can.
"> All Norwegian airports shut down Monday morning (16/3) at 0800.> Same goes for Norwegian ports. almost but not exactly: airports stay open for returning norwegians and residents:https:/…flyplassene-stenger-ikkeand border police is not going to impeach non-residents travelers in the country to leave it :)but anyway remaining tourists should hurry, because practicalities are not clear, what Erna didn't explain is that this works the other way around: Norway being a risk area, not sure that foreign airliners will want to fly planes to Norway just for some norwegians stranded in Malaga, Canarias, Nice, etc, to get home and for non-residents to leave by air, there must be planes available, typically the ones carrying norwegians home... what happens with tourists who had a return ticket for sometime after monday? etcthe fun of the quarantine rule is that now it will be mostly both-ways: tourists returning to their countries may get it because arriving from higly-infected Norway..."
"Yes, I was a bit quick, that piece of infomation was adjusted a bit later.I'm a bit curious about these figures because they refer to those being confirmed corona infected, which means that the persons have to be tested for the virus in the first place. Norway ha sick pay from day one, so there is no personal incentive for a person not to test himself, other countries have different systems. I think there are large numbers of unrecorded infected everywhere, the death rate (death per infected) still varies wildly. Interesting times."
In France people with mild symptoms are not systematically tested anymore (anyone with symptoms is of course required to self-quarantine). I agree that there are very likely a lot more cases everywhere than the official counts. Stay safe everyone.
