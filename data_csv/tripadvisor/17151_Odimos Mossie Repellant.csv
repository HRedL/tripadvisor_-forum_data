"Thinking of buying this from DiMello's in Cavelossim - is it a spray or rollon, please?"
I think it comes in every guise ... a cream too.
"Like music says you can get cream or spray, I use to use it but not any more,as found I was getting bitten still. Some people are fine with it, however note it as only 12 percent deet, and 50 percent is recommended. I use boots own, which as 50 percent deet and works wanders. Not one bite this year:)), saw lots of people with bites this year however."
"I had more bites this year than in the last 10 put together I think. I was using Boots tropical 50% deet roll on, but was still bitten, so changed completely to Mossieguard Extra, which doesn't have any deet in it at all, but citronella, menthol etc (it is recommended for use in the tropics), and hey presto, no more bites. Well, not until I got to Mumbai airport anyway. So I'll be stocking up with Mossieguard for next year, and not bothering with the deet-based stuff any more. Odomos doesn't work for me at all."
"We also tried Odomos and it had no affect....I am like a mossie magnet and have to use deet based sprays...Repell 55 is good, sell on amazon....They also do Repell 100, that even keeps the O/H from biting... lol"
Works fine for me but saying that I don't get bit even if I don't put any on.
works with me never get bitten also drink lots of guinness for a few weeks before you go that works to
We use repel 55 too Glyn H. Been 4 times and not one bite between us!
"Found Sand-Flies a big problem this year, interesting article and a bit scaryinfoplease.com/cig/dangerous-diseases-epidemâ€¦"
