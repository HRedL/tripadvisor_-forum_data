"I've already asked a similar question on here and, oddly, not had a response. So I'm trying again in the hope that this time someone in the know will see this. I'm looking at flights via all sorts of searches including directly through the airlines themselves. The best deals at the moment, though, seem to be on hopper.com iOS app. But I'm worried that it's just another third party ticketing agent and that if I buy through it I'll be opening myself up to all the potential problems that an be associated with such purchases. What do people think? Once we've bought will the price stay the same? Are the deals on Hopper coming direct from the airlines? One thing that concerns me is, unlike with Skyscanner, it's not made clear on the app exactly where each deal has come from.... Help me, please! I need to get these flights booked but am scared to without being fully in the know! Thanks :)"
"The reason you're not seeing any reviews is that (a) this is a very new company, and (b) they only provide a search via their app - there's no web search capability - which means people have to download it and check it out. I may try it if I have time tomorrow. That worries me a little, as why wouldn't they add a web search?As for their website, they appear to be a legit startup. Here's their ""About Us"" page, and people can delve into it and check whether their staff exist or not. Assuming they are legit, whether that means they're any good is another matter."
Thanks for responding! :) I just wish I knew who I was booking with... Surely some people on here must have used it by now?
I just wish I knew who I was booking with...=================Trouble is you don't. Susie this is a straight gamble and no one knows how risk averse you are. Only you do. You have to weigh up whether the perceived saving of Hopper over the airline direct is worth the risk.How much are you saving per ticket?
"The advice always given on this forum is to book direct with the airline rather than with a doubtful online agency.If any web site is offering tickets significantly cheaper than the airline, then there is a strong possibility that the site is a scam of some kind."
"Well, one one-way journey is £718.92 on the airline's own website and £653 through Hopper... That's not my exact trip, but I just wanted to compare like with like."

Apple voted it their best travel app if that skews your opinioncntraveler.com/stories/2015-12-18/this-is-th…There are some reviews on the App Store site and on Google Play. Not many thoughhttps:/…id904052407https://play.google.com/store/apps/details…
I try to be an early adopter and downloaded the app. I personally did not find the app to be useful and worth using so it was deleted. fwiw
OK so I downloaded it and tried a dummy booking for March 17 - 21 AMS - EDI. Cheapest fare on Hopper was £121. Went to Google flights and it was £105 for the cheapest flights those dates. Also Hopper didn't bring up Easyjet flights. Only KLM and EZY fly this route so not too much choice. Easyjet are £82. Both these prices were live from the respective airlines sites not a third party. So does not instil confidence in the app really.I tried to log in via facebook and it wanted to send a verification message to my phone. Only thing was it asked for the number but set the country code to +44 and I couldn't change it so I'd either have to hunt my UK phone out and probably charge it or set up a login. Not sure I'll bother.

"Hi belomiser, Sorry to hear that. We would love to get your feedback though. Would you mind emailing us at support@hopper.com with some more details about how you think we could improve? Thanks!Thanks,Brianna @ HopperSupport@hopper.com"
"Hi RonaldoC,Thanks for using the Hopper app and passing along valuable feedback regarding our coverage! Our predictions and flight lists include over 250 carriers worldwide but not all of them. Our coverage does include Europe; however, Ryanair and Easyjet are not currently sharing their data with Hopper, so we are unable to include their flights at this time. We're also missing some regional low-cost carriers. We are continually improving our coverage in North America, Europe and elsewhere internationally, so we do hope to offer more carriers soon. If you'd like to help, please tweet at your favorite airline and encourage them to feature their fares on Hopper!Best,Brianna @ HopperSupport@hopper.com"
"Hi Brianna,Thank you for your reply. However, I believe my concerns are adequately covered by the paragraph quoted by BK_T1 earlier in the thread. As hopper.com includes quotes from other third-party websites, and cannot guarantee how those third-party websites will behave with my booking, then I cannot buy from this app. Many thanks."
"Hi Susie,No problem and thanks for the feedback! We actually handle all bookings ourselves directly in the app. The third-parties you mentioned are the airlines since we need to confirm all bookings with them. However, your entire itinerary will be managed by Hopper so if you need any help our support team is available.We understand that everyone may not be comfortable booking on their phones, but for those who are we offer a unique and seamless experience that has earned us near-perfect reviews in the App Store from our millions of users. If you have any further questions, feel free to email us at support@hopper.com.Best,Brianna @ HopperSupport@hopper.comEdited: 4 years ago "
">>your entire itinerary will be managed by Hopper so if you need any help our support team is available<<Brianna - with the greatest respect, what exactly would that mean in terms of meaningful help if somebody purchased an itinerary from Hopper which involved a plane and airline change in an intermediate airport and the first flight was late for weather or technical reasons, so the second flight was missed? Would you be proactively booking the passenger on the next available flight at no extra cost? How would the impacted passenger be able to contact you and you be able to help in a timely manner in this kind of a situation?SWT"
"Hi SWT,Thanks for reaching out! Our customer support team handles any issues related to your booking, including elective flight changes or cancellations, up until the time of your departure. They are accessible via phone or email. As with any OTA like Priceline or Expedia, weather delays and connections are handled by the airline. We are happy to assist you if you are unable to reach the airline, of course, but once your trip starts the carrier is responsible for anything related to the actual operation of your flight. Hope that helps! If you have any additional questions, you're welcome to email support@hopper.com.Thanks,Brianna @ HopperSupport@Hopper.com"
"So, sorry to be dumb, but how does that support your claim that the entire itinerary is managed by you, if at some point you hand over responsibility to the airline? SWT"
That sounds like every other OTA from the OK (Expedia) to the downright dismal (take your pick). Cannot see the point in such an oversupplied market.
For a potential saving of just 9% versus the potential pitfalls... Not a chance.
">> Ryanair and Easyjet are not currently sharing their data with Hopper. We're also missing some regional low-cost carriers. We are continually improving our coverage in North America, Europe and elsewhere internationally, so we do hope to offer more carriers soon.<<OK feel free to let us know when you add the biggest carriers in Europe then."
"Thank you Brianna, so from your answers to mine and SWT's concerns, are we to understand that a booking with Hopper is made only with one airline? In other words, if I book a journey with several stops does the responsibility for the entire round trip rest with one airline company? For example, I am looking at a Dublin-Manchester-Orlando trip on the app, but when you click through to the booking page it only supplies T&Cs for Aer Lingus. In the itinerary it says that the second flight is Virgin. Is the entire booking made with Aer Lingus then? Or would we have two separately booked flights and be stranded if our first flight was delayed, thanks to them being separately booked with two different airlines? I think this is what SWT was driving at...There are also consequences regarding baggage dependant on whether such a trip is booked with two separate carriers which concern me..."
"Susie - if you go ahead and use Hopper, may I wish you well and hope it all works out for you. From my own point of view, given Brianna's comments and the noticeable dearth of airlines that Hopper has access to, I won't be touching them with a barge pole.SWT"
"Thank you SWT, however I think I will give them a miss myself. My concerns have been compounded by the fact that at around this time yesterday I sent a message to them through their website support message service, and I have yet to receive a reply. When an agent is quicker to respond to queries on a public forum rather than to those conducted in private, then I have to worry..."
"And, surprise surprise, Brianna is nowhere to be seen..."
"I went ahead and booked hopper, got a great deal virgin Brisbane to New York $1018 AUD return with non stop Brisbane to LA. $10 booking fee Hopper.Immediately on booking were given a virgin and hopper booking number.Looked up the virgin website and was able to retrieve the booking no worries. Was unable to get seat selection, so emailed hopper and within the day a reply plus seat allocation given, which is on the virgin itinerary now.A slight change in virgin flight times was emailed to me by hopper and also notified by the app.I like the app and would use it again, it alerts you immediately the price has come down which beats looking yourself every day."
I also just had my flight canceled. It only canceled my boyfriend's flight and not mine. I tried calling the hotline and it brought my to some odd site. Horrible app. Not going to use it again.
did the airline cancel the flight?or was it hopper?How far out did it get cancelled? now i am worried!
"What an awful app. I booked tickets for myself and my boyfriend. Less than a month before our trans-anlantic trip they canceled only my boyfriends flight. They don't return e-mails and the phone number they have listed for Israel doesn't work. Now my boyfriend will have to buy a 1,900 ticket if he still wants to fly with me."
Same thing happened to me! I've been trying to contact the company all morning!
"I booked tickets for myself and my boyfriend. Less than a month before our trans-anlantic trip they canceled only my boyfriends flight. Hopper hasn't return my e-mails and the phone number you have listed for Israel doesn't work. We called KLM and they told us that boyfriend will have to buy a 1,900 ticket if he still wants to fly with me. How can you just cancel a booking like this without providing any alternative. If this issue isn't resolved soon I will never be booking with you again."
Susie your faith in people in the know is misplaced.For a ten percent saving don't do it.
"Hi there Leah,Thanks for reaching out. I’m from Hopper’s customer support team and we just answered your email about this particular issue!Best, Jezebel @ Hopper Support"
"I just used Hopper to book four airline tickets for myself and my family to the UK, and we had zero problems, AND I easily saved us about $1000. No joke. We had no issues with our flights other than one of our carriers changing a departure time, but that had nothing to do with Hopper, and in fact Hopper was super proactive in notifying me of the change while we were traveling and making sure that our flights home were sorted and solid. I will definitely continue using it. The whole experience was easy and I definitely appreciated the tips and tricks to getting cheaper flights."
"I was asking the same thing and it looks from these posts that none has had luck with them. They have emailed me severL times(my neighbor too)since we are trying to get good prices early to Key West from Norfolk. Says $376which is too good to be true. After 15min of typing all the info in, there are no flights at this time for mid February! Something is fishyCourtney"
"A lot of the 'sraper' styled comparison websites don't always give the correct up to date pricing, and what I have found is the headline price is not normally what you are booking, its usually the cheapest price that day not particularly the times you want. I always use these as a guide and use Skyscanner for example where they will send you an email alert of the times/flights you particularly want daily or weekly what every your preference."
"if price is your only yardstick, perhaps. my experience has been that in not booking directly through the airline (turkish air) your only option to make changes is through the Hopper telephone line."
"I use it to check the prices for different days around the traveling time. It is good site to check the price, e.g. Thursday costs more than Friday, for example."
"that's not true at all!! the airline websites always charge more for tickets than Orbitz, Priceline and Expedia. Have never used Hopper."
"I have only used the app to track a domestic US flight. I was looking a month ago for a flight that was $166, Hopper recommended we wait for better prices. I checked the prices frequently (on expedia) and it went up to the mid 200's to high 200's but Hopper continued to say to wait and it predicts lower prices. Last week I got a notification that I was too late and prices have gone up, it never even gave me the notification that it was a good time to book. Hopper is back to telling me to continue to wait for better prices. My flight is down to the 230's which was lower than last week based on expedia, I decided I'm not listening to Hopper. We are paying 60+ dollars each and there are 3 of us, I should have just booked it last month. I am tracking a few other flights, both international and domestic, I am probably not going to use Hopper for these. Anyone have good experiences? I was reallyhoping that this app would help me out."
Just booked a flight for 2 on Spirit from Vegas to Seattle rt on Hopper. No problem. Great price. Verified it on Spirit site after email confirmation from Hopper. No problem. Feel satisfied.
Haven't used Hopper myself. But my card was used fraudulently 8 times to make purchases on the hopper app. Luckily my bank and the airline are opening up investigations into this - but I contacted Hopper and they wont investigate it. They just refused. Said it is not their business.Quite shocked that such a new company has such a poor policy on trust and security. I would strongly recommend to avoid them at all costs.
"""that's not true at all!! the airline websites always charge more for tickets than Orbitz, Priceline and Expedia. Have never used Hopper.""The above post simply is not true. ANY seasoned price-based traveler will tell you the best price is almost exclusively found directly from the airlines website. It is simply a matter of finding the cheapest day and time that they offer. Oh, and Orbitz, Expedia... owned by the same company that owns about 12 or more other travel search engines. Priceline can find some cheap airline tickets, but you can expect to be inconvenienced by multiple layovers and extended wait times for connections. Priceline is great- for hotels, and only then if you use their bidding option which only guarantees a star level and general area.Edited: 4 years ago "
I booked a flight thru Hopper without any issues
"How did it go ? I am from canada and i wanted to book a trip i just worried on how will it go ,"
We booked a flight through Hopper as they were the only site that offered a 14 hour flight duration from Jhb to Bkk for our dates.Due to a very short layover we emailed the airline who informed us that we would definitely not make our connecting flight in time and that we would have to change our flight at our cost (also increasing our flight duration by 6 hours therefore no longer making it an economical flight at all). Hopper promised to sort this out.Hopper then responded to inform us that they tried ‘their best’ but unfortunately the flight cannot be refunded and we will be liable for the flight amendment fee as the current flight that we booked through their app cannot be used.Hopper sold us a product that we cannot use so i will definitely not recommend using them.
"Some friends of mine recommended Hopper to me earlier this summer. I downloaded the app and entered a fare alert for a trip to England in the fall that, to be honest, I'd written off as being too expensive this year. Then forgot about it. Imagine my surprise when I got a fair alert from the Hopper app with multiple carriers all offering sub $700.00 round trip airfares. Of course, not knowing any better, I ended up buying directly from the airline and ended up with airfare for the dates and times i wanted (making sure to allow myself adequate time between connections) for about $5.00 less than the Hopper lowest fare.So I give Hopper high marks for fare alert. Can't offer opinion on anything else. My friends did buy tickets to Paris for November using Hopper. I'll be curious as to their ultimate experience."
"I concur. I have been using Hopper as a fare watch app (I didn't even realize you could buy through them). I received an alert this morning about a great fare to Italy next June/July. I booked it through Bank of America Travel Center (to get double points on my card with them) at the same price. Glad I jumped on it as the price more than doubled (back to where it was in recent weeks) after a few hours. I still can't believe I found tickets JFK>Venice, then Rome>JFK for $735 RT!!"
"So I wasn't crazy. I was playing around with Hopper and comparing it to Kayak, etc for next summer. For about a half hour or so, I was getting amazing fares ($735.00-750.00) to various places in Europe, then, bam, back to $1500.00 or more. Weird. Maybe should go ahead and set fare alert for NEXT trip. ;)"
"while the app is very good, their customer service is very bad. i would recommend that THE APP CAN BE USED ONLY AS A TRACKER FOR CHEAP FLIGHTS but when it comes to booking a flight do it directly with the airline. if you search the airline they would show the same price. why i say this? because if later on you want to make changes you can deal directly with the airline. save yourself from unwanted stress and save your money. one more thing, when you call them about any changes or questions regarding your booking they don't do verification so it leaves your credit card info at risk. i had to call my bank to stop authorizing any transactions from them in the future. just my experience with them. i hope this does not get deleted."
"I just booked my flight through hopper on Sept 8 2016 and paid for it. They emailed me my iterenary without the ticket number. I called them up [ and by the way it takes an hour of wait ] and found out that my booking was cancelled. and refund will take 5 to 7 business days. i check on their app, same flight more than double the price. i WOULD NOT recommend HOPPER to my worst enemy!!!!"
"I don't have any vested interested in Hopper, but I am curious if you checked your spam filter for a second email canceling your flight? The only reason I ask is because, as I said, I booked my ticket directly via American. They emailed me an ""itinerary"" with ""Ticket Pending"" and then shortly emailed me a confirmation with my ticket number. It is possible that the same could have happened to you, and your cancellation notice never reached you.Again, I don't doubt that your ticket was canceled without notice, and that you've perfectly illustrated why it's important to consider carefully before purchasing from a third party reseller."
"I booked an American Airlines flight on Hopper recently. I paid on the Hopper app and within 10-15 minutes I could look my flight up on the AA website and choose my seats. I haven't flown it yet, but it seems to be a good service, so far. Plus I saved about $150. I would recommended based on my experience so far."
"I recently purchased tickets using hopper for a trip in November. The tickets came out of my account directly from the airline and there was a separate charge from hopper for their fee. I've seen on some facebook forums that it's accurate. I've spent a bunch of money with them...so, I'm hoping it all works out!"
I didnt found how to book and pay at all!! Still curious where is this option hide
I used it once and purchased a round trip flight from the states to Colombia a a ridiculously cheap flight and there were no complications! Really great app and easy to use.
"Just FYI. We received our bank statement recently for a $5 charge to Hopper.coma (yes, COMA) for 9/13/2016. The same day a ticket for $261 was charged for Hahn Air, a German airline with flights only in Europe. Obviously our card number was stolen, but Hopper had no problem charging an American account for a round trip ticket between two Russian cities."
"Just booked flight from the states back to Ireland over Christmas via Hopper. Really liked the updates on prices of flights over the last few weeks, and after extensively reading through this tread, decided to book through Hopper. Saved over $300, and got all my flights confirmation numbers a few min later. Checked those numbers on the actual airlines sites (trip is with multiple airlines and layovers), and my info came up with the flight details straight away. So far its been great and would recommend as I've saved a lot of money. I see other people in this thread have run into problems when looking to contact them regarding changing flights or issues like that, but I'm hoping it will run smoothly for me!"
Yes they are amazing! We ( 4 adults)flew on Lufthansa to the christmas markets in Munich and then on to Italy for $600 each in high season..Great!! Have used a few times and recommended to all my friends. They are the only search engine that lets you put in multiple countries. if you have relatives in Europe its super helpful to know that you can fly into a neighboring country and save $$$..
No multi-city option. That renders the app virtually useless for me as most of my bookings are open-jaw/multi-city.
It's a great app! What I did was set it to alert me when a flight from JFK to Milan went below 600.00 USD. I got an alert that the fare - RT- was 498. I then went directly to the airline website (Delta) and purchased the deal of a lifetime! You could book directly through the app but I prefer to book directly with the airline.
"I am about to take the plunge and book a ticket return to Koh samui from Melbourne $1330 return as opposed to $1399 webjet. waiting to hear from Flight centre but not holding my breath... save $120 on tickets, so I reckon it's worth it, maybe, Yes?"
"Personally i have never used Hopper App myself, but hope it all works out for you if you decide to book flights through them. Whether it is worth trying or not really depends on how much risk are you willing to take on to get these cheap tickets / save $120 on tickets..."

I was cursing myself on why did I not read this review before buying through them. I loved the app and suggested it to many people. I like the search and notification but ended up doing the mistake of booking my international travel using the app. They simply moved from travel dates for both outgoing and return flights. On calling the airlines they asked to talk to the Hopper guys. I have been running behind their support team that is suppose to handle these situations but no luck. The app still shows the old dates. I will strongly suggest just using them for search but never buy anything through the app.
"Hopper is misleading. They don't tell you until after you've booked your flights that your flight dates can change by up to 3 days! How is anyone supposed to plan a trip that way? The fee that they charge you for booking a flight is not refundable so they make their money either way. Then when you try to cancel the flight, they cant seem to find your confirmation number in their system. I am still trying to get my flight canceled and get my refund. This company is either purposely misleading people or are incompetent, either way, it's a terrible service and i would steer clear of them."
"I'm finding charges on my credit card from them (only $1 and $5) that I didn't expect. Not much money, but I dont remember it being noted anywhere that I would be charged for booking a flight through their site. I'm still looking into it. Not too happy."
"I will never use Hopper again. Our family trip to Mexico for Christmas doubled in price, as Hopper kept saying to wait. I finally booked our flights today at double what the fare was last month, when Hopper kept saying to wait! I will never use Hopper again. DON'T USE HOPPER!!!"
"DON'T USE HOPPER!!! Out family vacation to Mexico at Christmas doubled in cost, as Hopper kept saying wait to book-airfares will drop. In fact, they doubled!! I finally booked us today at twice the price of last month, when Hopper kept saying to wait. I will never use Hopper again. DON'T USE HOPPER!!!Edited: 3 years ago "
I use hopper app - it does not always have the lowest price though. I then book through expedia on the upromise site and earn points for travel and money back for my kids' college funds (which can be cashed out at any time and really used for anything)..googleflights.com is better and they do price alerts via mobile phone or email. I like how you can see 2 month's worth of airfare prices at a time and they highlight lowest prices in green.
"PhilipI am impressed. Expedia points, college fund credit, and FF miles with airlines. Is that triple dipping? You really know how to maximize that dollar :) good jobPs. Do you use a rebate credit card to pay?Edited: 3 years ago "
"I just had a poor experience today. I do not recommend using the app to purchase flights. It may be useful for predicting fares, but their prices are not accurate. In my case, I was billed 3x the cost of the ticket advertised on the app.I purchased a flight from Hopper for $311 but was actually billed $932 on my credit card. I even received a receipt from Hopper stating the flight cost of $311.Luckily, I check my credit card statement religiously and was able to notice the charge within the 24-hour cancellation period. After speaking with Hopper customer service, they claimed they were unable to correct the price of the flight because they are merely a booking service. Thus, they suggested I call the airline to cancel the flight and rebook. I called the airline and am able to rebook, but now the ticket cost is $622 rather than $311. The airline stated the ticket cost was never $311 and that Hopper had a false price advertised.So after being bounced back and forth between customer service agents, I called Hopper again. Hopper apologized for the issue and stated that there was nothing they could do, citing a glitch in their booking system causing false prices to be listed. The only option suggested was to refund my ticket. What a mess.To answer your question, the Hopper App is NOT trustworthy.They need to update their FAQ topic, ""Is booking with Hopper safe?"" (https://support.hopper.com/hc/en-us/articles…), with a big fat no. Booking with Hopper is a gamble at best, and sometimes you may even be charged 3x the listed fare on the app.You would think that Hopper could do SOMETHING to make the situation right, in good-will for their customers. Sadly, this is not that kind of company. Shame on them."
"I doubt any company will ever say that they are not safe, nor will they highlight customers poor experiences on their own site :-)"
"Hoppers app is amazing, I have however just experienced the most unfortunate experience with Hopper and Frontier Airlines. I found a wonderful deal to go see my family for Christmas, 622.40 for my boyfriend and I. Today I got 3 charges on my account from Hopper no surprises there. Then 1,732.40 from Frontier Airlines for my flight. I got an email letting my know my flight was canceled today and ""the airline may have charged you a higher price."" When I asked to speak to someone, help get my flight reinstated, or for an explanation of how they allowed a third party to take so much unauthorized funds from my account I got an email. ""The fares Frontier shared with us were incorrectly loaded into the app resulting in these overcharges"" ""I hope you're able to scoop up the fares you need at a price that your comfortable with"". I have no flight, a pending amount on my account preventing my from being able to purchase a flight or pay my full rent and an email basically stating good luck hope it works out."
"***Update to my previous post***After multiple emails and phone calls with Hopper customer service, they agreed to reimburse me the price difference between my initial Hopper.com booking ($311) and the cost of the flight booked directly with the airline ($632). It sounds like I wasn't the only one that had issues with Hopper's booking system, but at least they were able to right the situation with me by reimbursing me the difference. I'm thankful for being reimbursed, but I hope that they fix this issue soon so that other customers aren't overcharged and/or lose out on their vacation plans."
Use it to track price drop but purchase directly from the airline instead of from them.
"We used Hopper to fly from Philadelphia to Milan last June. Their price was 563 USD round trip. My searches on other sites were all running 1000 USD and up. We had a great experience, not a single issue. I am using Hopper to watch for flights to Prague and Croatia for this summer!"
"BUYER BEWARE! AKA. ""HOW TO USE HOPPER WITHOUT GETTING F**KED""My girlfriend booked a flight through Hopper 2 months in advance.She received confirmation emails AND they charged her credit card.Day before travel she checked flight status and she did NOT have a ticket with the American Airlines as indicated by the confirmation emails. She had to re-book through another airline paying MUCH more because it was the day before.MY ADVICE FOR USING HOPPERAFAIK, Hopper does not actually get special flight deals. They are just constantly monitoring the prices and alert you when it's cheapest (or predict how long to wait)When you find a good deal on Hopper, simply go to the carrier's website. The price will be there. BOOK DIRECTLY.Booking through something like Hopper will put you at the very bottom of the list if anything ever goes wrong on a flight (overbooked, etc)"
I have used the hopper app to book flights AMS-MEL. The saving vs other sights was >50%. Less than 2100 Euros return for a family of 4 is insanely cheap. Payment was made direct to the carrier NOT to Hopper which was a surprise at the time but gave me some additional comfort. I have contacted their customer support line and got a prompt reply (was having trouble pre booking seats). Was redirected to the carrier who helped me out and also confirmed that I actually had tickets. Like any discount price provider you do get what you pay for and the run around sorting out the logistics of our trip is harder than if I had booked direct but I will do a bit of running around if it saves me a few thousand euros...They are real! You can book real flights.There are real people when you have a question.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Hey, just wondering if you ended up booking through the hopper app and if it worked ? Was there any problems ?"
"I haven't read through all the responses on Hopper, as I only just came across this thread. Forgive me if this is repetition. I used them about 10 months ago to book a trip to Oaxaca, Mexico, and it worked beautifully. They had a fare about $200-$300 less than anybody else. When I saw the fare I checked other sites, including the airline's, and no one else had it, and I don't believe they ever did. I had been watching the fare for a while. I booked it while sitting in a bar -- it was a Delta flight operated by AeroMexico, and there were absolutely no glitches. Of course I checked, and I was in the airline's system immediately. Once I see that, I don't worry. Hopper notifies you of any changes (they even emailed me about a time change in one of the connecting flights that amounted to less than five minutes), and it was possible to reach a customer service rep by phone if need be. I'm following a flight right now with them -- right now the deals don't differ from what the airline is offering. You can get on their alert system, and you'll get a ping when a price changes. There's a small service charge for booking with them, but when you're saving $200-$300, who cares?"
"I tried to edit the above message, but my editing time had expired. After reading through a few posts, I would curb my enthusiasm for Hopper, as while my experience was great almost a year ago, others didn't fare so well. As someone else suggested, Hopper might be best used as an alert system for when a fare drops -- use it as a cue for when to check the airline's site."
"I used Hopper to check flights and they advised me the price for my flights was €281 but to hold on because it would get cheaper. I got two further notifications saying the same thing. Big mistake, flight is now €342"
"I had booked 3 tickets from Austin TX to Hochiminh city Vietnam in October. The flight date is January 20, 2017 return on March 27. About $720 each. The flights are by United and Air China. The first 2,3 weeks I had some concern since when I access these airlines websites to check the confirmation number, it was not recognized. Then I got the itinerary from United I was just a little bit assured. Today I am on the flights to Hochiminh city. So Hopper is real and saving me a lot of money since with other airlines, I would have paid $1,400 or more a ticket during this Lunar New Yesr festival. I had waited to this day to let you all know about Hopper."
"I would not recommend purchasing via Hopper, since Hopper purchase cheap tickets through various airlines that will have many hidden conditions, such as a ridiculously high change fee. I had an extremely unpleasant experience when I gave the app a try. I initially booked a flight BOS-LAX on Dec 21 and LAX-BOS on Jan 21. I was issued two tickets: one with United and the other with American Airlines (AA). I did not travel on the United flight on Dec 21 because I had to return to LAX earlier on Dec 16, so I bought a separate one-way ticket to go to LA on Dec 16. I was not aware, until today when I tried to check in at the airport for my flight back to Boston with AA, that United Airlines has a policy that if I did not use the going forward ticket, the entire round trip ticket is invalidated and I could not use the return ticket with AA. I guess the disadvantage of using an app like Hopper to purchase a plane ticket was that entire ticket purchase process was so straightforward that I was not notified of this condition by United Airlines. It was also misleading because there were 2 separate airlines for each leg of the round trip, so it was natural to assume that if I did not use the United ticket to fly to LA, I could still use the American Airlines ticket to return to Boston. Who would have guessed that the 2 tickets operate under United who invalidated my AA ticket since I did not board the first flight on Dec 21.  In the end I spent $384 plus a Hopper fee for a round-trip ticket that I could not use."
"""United Airlines has a policy that if I did not use the going forward ticket, the entire round trip ticket is invalidated and I could not use the return ticket with AA.""---It's not just United that have this policy, a lot of other airlines do too."
"I have followed Hopper for several international flights. They do not appear to be the most accurate in their reporting. For the purpose of my travel analysis, I tracked Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkish AirlinesExample 1: Singapore Airlines booked direct on their website (on my required dates) from IST to HKG or IST to BKK or IST to SIN was actually $100-$150 CHEAPER each flight than reported for Singapore Airlines on Hopper. Also, the sale fares on the Singapore Airlines own website were available about 2 weeks BEFORE Hopper started showing any price reduction what-so-ever. This occurred in Jan 2017.Example 2: Hopper NEVER reported the January actual lower sale fares on Qatar Airlines which were readily available on Expedia, Orbitz, Hotwire and Qatar Airlines own website for the same flights in Example 1. Their reported fares for Qatar airlines were always higher on Hopper.Example 3: Emirates ran an extensive sale during late December until mid January for trips running through December 31. 2017. Prices on Emirates were ALWAYS lower on other websites than reported on Hopper.Based upon my personal observations across the months of December 2016 and January 2017, when I watched Hopper and tracked several other fare sites (Hotwire, Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia) on a daily basis, I found that Hopper TOTALLY MISSED reporting of lower airfares for the international flights and dates which I was seeking.I also followed Hopper for a couple of inter-European flights such as Frankfurt to Malta, London to Amsterdam and a few other locations as well. Strangely enough, Hopper seemed to work ""better"" for these European destinations. Keep in mind that Hopper does not report for discounters EasyJet nor Ryanair nor Southwest nor DELTA.Truth be told ... the best fare reporting I have found is 100% hands down on MOMONDO.COM.Edited: 3 years ago "
"J'ai réservé des billets pour NewYork via cette application. Les prix sont intéressants mais au final j'ai été débité deux fois de l'intégralité des billets (soit une arnaque de + de 1500 euros). Et quand je demande le remboursement à Hopper ils me disent qu'ils n'y sont pour rien, que c'est la compagnie .. etc .. Mais mon seul interlocuteur lors de l'achat a été Hopper."
"Hopper -- not worth the bother, IMHO. I booked a return trip between Vancouver, Canada and Auckland, NZ. Due to changes in my schedule I needed to re-book the flight for 3 months later.#1. It was agonizing trying to contact their customer service by phone. I did not want to send my credit card number through email, so I ended up being on hold for literally 30+ minutes.#2. When I finally talked to their customer service, the change fees for the new itinerary were absolutely ridiculous. The agent was not helpful in trying to source alternate dates to bring the fees down, and accidentally hung up on me -- after putting me on hold for a very long time.#3. They are relatively prompt to responding by email (within 24h) but this is not the most efficient away to deal with re-booking a flight, especially if you are in hurry and need to forward payment info, etc.I ended up calling AirNZ and they got me the fares and dates I wanted, they were very friendly and helpful. Hopper is amateurish by comparison. NOT RECOMMENDED."
I just booked with Hopper and chose United Airlines for a rtrip . It was very easy to use and they only charged me a $15 fee for using them. My confirmation number was issued by United and I went to the United website to confirm and everything was there! What Hopper does is send you emails if you are searching in advance for the best ticket prices. They will alert you if they are up or down and let you know if it's the best time to purchase tickrets. They emailed me to alert me this was probably the best time price waise as flight prices would be going up shortly. I checked directly with the airlines and Hopper was right. After making my reservations I called United and everything was in order! Once you book on Hopper it takes you to the airline website.
Why spend $15 more? Why not book directly with United?
"Did the ticket you book through hopper have 016 as the first 3 digits of the ticket number? If it does, it is the same as if it was bought through united directly."
"I have booked a flight from Calgary to Tampa and return coming up in March. I too was leary of booking, but decided to take a chance. Once booked I confirmed on WestJet's website that we are actually booked on the flights they specified. The only thing that has happened is that one of our connecting flights has changed because the airline cancelled that particular flight. We were booked onto another flight with no additional cost, but it wasn't necessarily the best connection. Means instead of getting into tampa at 10:30 pm it will be closer to midnight. I did search online for other possible connections and it seems this was the best possible. Since we haven't yet actually taken the trip, I can't comment on what actually happens until later."
I have purchased 3 international tickets using Hopper and have received huge savings. I bought 2 tickets to London and each ticket was less than $600. One of those tickets is during the summer and normally tickets to Europe are well over $1000. I also used Hopper to purchase a ticket from London to Norway and the price was lower than the other online websites including google flights. Each of these tickets were authenticated by the actual airlines. I have saved a lot of money using Hopper. I highly recommend it.
Hopper is much cheaper than the actual airlines in most cases.
"I had an horrible experience with Hopper. Had our flights rebooked 3 times after we purchased them, and the last time it added a one day stop at one of our transfer. Will never do business with Hopper again. We lost one day of vacation, plus the rental fee for the hotel at destination, plus we had to book an hotel to spend the night near our overnight transfer. All that after spending countless hour with them on the phone to find a better solution. They proposed acceptable compromises, but would always call back a few days later saying the option was not available in the end and then offered us something worse.In my humble opinion, the savings are simply not worth that kind of risk."
"hello, I have booked hopper yesterday and after booking they have send my confirmation afterward but after several minutes, i received an email from hopper telling me that they have found descrepancies so they ask for the ff...below, and my problem is they are asking for my picture for proof that it was me who is booking with them, This is the list that they are asking:1. govt picture issued ID matching the name of the card holder2.screen shot of pending transaction in the bank3.a photo of the card holder taken from the mobile device??????????number 3 is just insane, y do i need to take my picture and send this to them since i already have send my govt IDwith my picture on it????? could somebody give me an idea.....i have booked MANILA-IAX Texas cost 893$a friend of mine told me that her friends used it too..."
"Hello, can i ask if hopper is asking this to you? thank you your response is highly appreciated..Good day! A photo of the cardholder taken from the mobile device on which you made your Hopper bookingThe photo is just to match you with the photo on your ID so that we can confirm that it is in fact you, the card holder, who has the card, and not someone who is simply posing as you. As we understand that this is a bit cumbersome, following the confirmation of your identity we will happily refund you the Hopper Fee charged to your card when you made this booking :)"
"I have Hopper tracking prices to South Korea for me. I get an alert once a week or so that gives me a price and then says something like ""but we expect the price to be lower in the future"". Every alert, for the most part, has given me a higher price than the one before. I'm going to stop them because it's pointless to keep getting alerts that don't show lower airfare. I've been getting this for about 6 months, maybe a bit longer."
"I am super Disappointed with this company.I received a confirmation and a reservation number. They took the money from the bank and 2 days later, they wrote saying that I needed to send:1. govt picture issued ID matching the name of the card holder2.screen shot of pending transaction in the bank3.a photo of the card holder taken from the mobile deviceThis is so weird to me. Super weird.Then, because I saw my email late, and did not answer on time, they cancelled my reservation arbitrarily and yes, returned the money, but I already made plans for my trip, and the result is now I do not have a way to go to the place, because they cancelled.This is a joke.They played with my time and my money.After my complaint, they wrote to me saying that is for my protection, but in reality is the bank that has to to worry about the security of my transactions.I am so upset right now. Never seen something similar to this before and still do not understand."
"I don't know about booking on Hopper, but it's terrific for finding out whether to wait or go ahead and book. Last year, we were looking for a fare to London from Orlando, and waited for Hopper to give the go-ahead. I got antsy and booked early. Two weeks later, Hopper said to book. Waiting would have saved us $300; not much against a $5000 fare (for 3 in Comfort), but it would have been on an airline with more roomy seats."
I bought a round trip ticket to Ireland four months ago for $1300+ The trip is in three months. I have to change the return date by two days. The change fee is $300. If I bought the ticket today the round trip fare is $862. Because of Hopper I'll pay $1600+ for an $862 flight.
"Actually I was wrong. When I called to change the dates, resigned to pay the $300 change fee, Hopper said that the ticket would be an additional $4,000. Plus the $300 change fee. Really. This comment goes with the one immediately below.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I booked a ticket via Hopper and ended up with pay more money. Due to their lack of customer care and confusing fare rule that no one explain clearly; I had to just go ahead pay fees and money that I got discount for using app to airline and change my ticket. I will never book a ticket with them. Just use it as a references. And be aware once you book a ticket with them don't expect any afterward service. I got yelled at, threatened and humiliated by their staff. Not much cheaper to bear that kind of inhuman treatment."
"NO IT IS NOT !!!!!! my brother and i went to krakow poland last week for a 3 day break, when we arrived at the alexander 11 in krakow we was to told our room had been cancelled two days previously they said and showed us a printout of the cancellation but did not show who cancelled it,we showed them email booking confirmation, bank statements, payment details through room hopper showing paid,the hotel was not interested and it was 10.30 pm ,they put us on the phone to there people who said if we wanted to stay we needed to pay to stay although we already have! ,we had to pay again,or go elsewhere by which time it was 11.30 pm and no idea where else to go and had arranged via another website for a full day tour at 8am the next day to auschwitz, so we could not even pay for just one night as we would not be available to vacate at midday ,so we paid again for the 3 nights and was going to sort it out when we got back ,now we are back my brother is in the process of sorting it out as he had no response from roomhopper whilst in poland,discusting website,incidentally the hotel was a dump and very noisy i had no sleep the first two nights and there were many other problems about the room,Edited: 3 years ago "
"Thanks, Hopper, you notified me to purchase my plane tickets today, saved a bunch of money! I even just finished my seat selection for my trip in October! I would recommend!"
"@ Linh from page 9, How would you not know this? This is no ones but your fault, every single airline has this rule...Edited: 3 years ago "
"Maybe I'm wrong but I think an airline would have let Linh change her ticket from BOS to LAX from Dec 21 to Dec 16 for a fee. When I tried to change my round-trip ticket to Dublin from San Diego - a trip three months from now - Hopper said it would be $300 change fee plus $4,000 for the return ticket (changed to two days later.) Since round trip tickets for my new dates are now $1,000 I conclude that tickets bought through Hopper are more expensive to change than tickets bought from the airline would be."
I just saved $800 using the Hopper app. I put in my dates and kept getting notices that the cost was $1200. Then one day it gave me a price of $400 (round trip to Spain) on multiple airlines. I went to the airline website and booked the ticket on Delta/Air France. The price lasted for 3 days and then went back to $1200 on those airlines. I am a very happy camper and if I knew how I would send them a fan letter.
"May be too late to help you, but 4 of us recently used hopper to fly from Atlanta to Dublin. It was a good experience! We had no problems and I did call their customer service with questions after booking and they were able to help. (I was confused about Jet Blues affiliation with Aer Lingus and how that affected luggage.) We were happy with the price, and the notifications while we were shopping. Just booked another trip with them for Atlanta to Copenhagen, got a great price of $525 round trip, nonstop!"
"I would not trust them. They lie about exchange fees to me. One said only $300. I called back to make the exchange and then it was $300 plus whatever other fees they wanted for the tickets and instead of working with me to find the same flights for the price, they just try to take the money and push me off. Guy was very rude and loud with me."
"I've used it twice now. The first time, I saved a little money and had no issues. The second time, I bought my tickets early to save money. Now there are issues with the flights because the airline changed the flights and they no longer connect. I called Hopper several times and waited on hold forever to finally get unhelpful support. I eventually got an email with just two options of how I could get to my destination, and they aren't very close to the original times I had scheduled for. Hopper isn't helpful in resolving this. I just have option 1 or option 2, or just try to cancel the whole thing and rebook with much higher rates now.I wouldn't use them again. Not great results, really bad customer service, and they don't seem to have a good relationship with their airline partners. Hopper didn't even know that my flights had changed and no longer connected!!!"
"I booked AMS-AUA and back yesterday with the app.....It makes agreat difference: about $ 200,- Early online checkin though does not work so we'll have to see about that at the airport at the company-desk."
"NO they are very unreasonable and extremely poor customer service.My children booked a flight with them for a gift. I had medical emergency and not only they would not give me a credit for another flight I was not even able to change the name on the $3,000+ tickets to one of my children so they could use the tickets. Customer service was horrible...first thing he said to me when I didn't have my flight information ready was ""How did you expect me to help you if you didn't have the Hopper Number?"" (I wanted to ask about changing the name on the ticket which would not need a number). Then later in the conversation when I asked if there was nothing he could do to help me? he replied ""What part of NO do you somehow not understand""I will never use this company again!!! $3,000+ simply gone"
DO NOT USE HOPPER!!!!!!! They are a bunch of scumbags. They charged me for a flight without sending confirmation. Lost 1600US plus they CANCELLED the TICKET!!!!!! MUCH safer to buy from the website directly.
"I just tried it once and it has caused us huge headaches. They posted three charges, two to determine whether my credit card was legitimate, and one for their seven dollar commission. The three charges triggered a decline on my card from Bank of America, and then the bank cancelled the card. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the card. Now we have to wait three days for new cards. In the meantime I will lose the rate on the flight I wanted, and this will cost me at least a hundred dollars, or more. Hopper customer service did reply to try to explain the charges, but say they cannot do anything about it. So I definitely do not recommend booking through this app! I do like the notifications and the feature that will watch prices and make price predictions, so I may continue to use those, and then book through someone else's."
IDK if they're trustworthy after the fact. But I will say that the process of getting questions answered prior to booking was enough to convince me not to use them. If you can't answer my question directly then I don't trust you. And customer service was awful.
"Hi! I must say I've had the worst experience with Hopper so far. Thought they will track and send you reminders on prices (Google flights can do the same, as well as any other website), DON'T EVER BUY YOUR TICKET THROUGH THE HOPPER APP. Cancellation, alteration and everything else is a PAIN, they will leave you hanging for over 30 minutes every time and never really resolve your problem. If you want to use it for checking prices, that is great. But don't buy through their app, always go to the airline."
"Do not book with Hopper. iBook edition on their online site and when I received my confirmation the destinations were reversed. I tried for four days to have a rep fix it. I emailed them 10 times and always got a response that they were confirming with their local supplier. When I talked to the local company they said I had to talk to Hopper. Finally at the last minute instead of missing my flight, I booked with a local cab company in Lagos. I guess I'm just forfeiting my Hopper prepaid fare and next time I'll go to the local company where you can actually get some good customer service instead of being lost in the uber world....."
"Short answer: No, Hopper is NOT reliable. Their customer service is, on the surface, appalling. Their support@hopper.com staff apparently doesn't read their email. For the particular problem I had, a call to the the ""for all other problems"" option led to a 20 minute queue to someone who told me my problem was handled by a different department. No, he couldn't transfer me. No, he couldn't give me a direct number. And no, I couldn't speak to his boss. He DID tell me I could get help via email at bookiing@hopper.com, but I am holding final judgment about whether or not I might use this company again as to whether or not they give me a timely response, a sufficient solution to my problem, and how they respond to my complaints. I'll let you know later."
"I've had the exact same dodgy experience. Having booked my flights today (which required me to enter my card details numerous times and rack up $14 in $1.50 fees to Hopper for I don't know what) and receiving an email confirmation from Hopper, I've since received another email, cryptically citing 'discrepancies' in my information, and saying I need to supply: 1. govt picture issued ID matching the name of the card holder2.screen shot of pending transaction in the bank3.a photo of the card holder taken from the mobile device.... exactly the sort of info most security experts would warn you not to send over email, especially to strange email address.However they're kindly saying that if I don't supply the info within a few hours (it's the middle of the night in Australia) they will cancel my booking. Crazy requests and really unhappy with how this has been handled.I've tried to call their 'Australian customer service line' which is answered by a voicemail of an imaging company in Perth!! How can a company as big as this not have a correct customer service line listed on their website??I'm a at loss as to what to do. I'd heard great things about Hopper but so far not so good."
"don't go with them - the booking is relatively simple, but otherwise we had a terrible experience,our flight back was cancelled for unknown reason, we had to buy new one way tickets for a different flight ( the original one was totally booked.two months later still fighting with them regarding reimbursement.HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!"
"It's definitely not trustworthy to me. Booked some tickets to Europe, and my ticket got cancelled. I have tried to get in touch with them, and they have not replied for weeks. Their lack of response to help me is terrible, and I regret for not purchasing directly from the airlines. Save yourself a headache. and stay away from this app. Or use with caution."
No ! They have in their terms that they can change the price of your trip even after you have purschased your tickets. I had a price jump up $231 dollars and the customer service agent Miss Ross told me they can do that if the airlines raise the price even after you book. It's a scam better prices on other sites that will not try and charge you more latter. Hopper is a scam
How did you get in contact with customer service?
Do not use hopper. I ordered tickets with them. I made a mistake on the ticket. I canceled it within 18 minutes of purchase. The tickets are canceled with united but hopper says I still owe the money. Crazy. They have a 24 hour cancelation policy. My 18 minutes was well within the 24 hours. I filed a complaint with the BBB.
I just bought tickets on hopper to Orlando Florida. Flights booked on American got s confirmation and itinerary. We leave tomorrow so so far no problems.
"Can the app be used strictly to watch a fare and then when the fare is where I want it, could I then go directly through the airline to book at the rate listed on Hopper? Or must the ticket be booked through Hopper in order to get the rate?"
"Yes, I have done this myself. You can use Hopper to alert you, follow it through to see the airline, route, etc. then go to the airline website yourself and see what price they show for the same details."
"I love Hopper! I have saved so much money using them. However, I just use them for the price alerts. I never book a flight with them. It's always best to book directly with the airline. Less complications this way"
"When you book a flight through the app you're booking with the airline itself and you get a confirmation from that airline - you reserve through the airline, not Hopper. (Although they do charge a small fee for their service). That service is an excellent watchdog of price variables - not only for real time choices but also their projection of potential fare increases/decreases. There's really no risk, other than booking at a price that may decrease at a later date. It's the best app I've found yet for evaluating all the variables you may have for your specific needs. I've just booked several one-way flights for a multi-destination trip and it was a breeze doing it all in one place. I was able to choose dates, times, airlines and pricing for each flight directly from the airline - which is the page you're on when you actually book. My only grumble is that two of my flights came down in price after I booked them! (I didn't turn the ""watch & notify"" option off after booking.) They found a flight from Colorado to Washington D.C. for $79 on a major carrier (AA) - and I paid under $100 for each hop between, including the return. They show you every detail and give you multiple choices before you commit. I'm beyond impressed with Hopper. I even opted to pay instead of using frequent flyer miles - it was cheaper by far! You can always just price shop with the app and compare. You're not committed or strong-armed by any gimmicks and you know exactly what you're buying. They just show you what's out there and you do all the deciding."
When I booked through Hopper it was definitely NOT with the airline. I wanted to change my flight by two days. Hopper wanted a $300 change fee and the new ticket for a one-way change of date was $4000 on a ticket that was originally $1300. The airline was selling a round-trip for those dates for $870 at that time.
As far as I can tell it is a useful app for information but I would book directly.
Check the review on PC magazine. They give it 5 stars! I have a friend who just booked a Thanksgiving flight from FL to Newark for about 150 round trip. The cheapest? Not sure but she was happy.
I just had a very bad Hopper experience. Booked trip to Cartagena for friend's wedding. Needed to change return trip so talked with Hopper agent who quoted $345 fee differential plus $115 change fee per ticket for two business class seats for a $920 total. After exploring other days with similar results I told the agent to make the change. On her own initiative she said she would call the airline to see if they would lower the cost and call me back within 30-60 minutes. Three hours later I get a voicemail saying it is now over $1200 to make the change I told them to make 3 hours earlier for $900. Spoke with supervisor who did nothing but parrot the agent that the price isn't final until the ticket is booked. Will never use Hopper again and caution anyone considering them to be very wary.

"The Hopper price for my flight is way lower than on the airline's site, so how can it be booking direct with the airline? I am loathe to trust it after some of the reviews."
"Hopper is a great and reliable app to use for price alerts. I've been using this for close to 2 years and I travel quite frequently. However, I NEVER book directly through the app. I always book directly with the airlines. I think this is where most people run into problems because they book though the app itself. It seems like Hopper is pricier when it comes to cancelations or changes to your flight.  In my experience, the price drops on the app have always coincided with the prices on the airlines' sites. Check your search filter settings. Maybe you have basic economy checked? That's the only reason I can think of why your flight is cheaper on the app"
"I have filed a formal complaint of the following:I called hopper earlier last week to inquire about transporting my pet. The person said she would call the booked airline Virgin-atlantic to inquire and call me back within a day. She did not. I called again and spoke to Anne. She told me the same thing that she would call Virgin-atlantic to inquire and call me back within by the end-of-day. She did not. I called again and spoke to Jayson, who was more supportive and investigated wilts I was on hold. We together figured out that Virgin-atlantic states they will not allow pet in the cabin but that they would ship in cargo, which I consider inhumane. Jayson investigated and found a website that advertises that Virgin-atlantic allows pets as carry-on and suggested I take this up with Virgin-atlantic, when I attempted to do so they wanted this information.I called Jayson back to asked him to provide this information to Virgin-atlantic and provided the contact information of the individual I spoke with. Hopper said they would do this but instead they (immediately after we were off the phone) sent a boilerplate email stating that Virgin-atlantic does not allow pets in the cabin. I found this response both rude and insulting to my intellect. It leads me to believe you never followed up with what your they said they would do. So this is the third time that Hopper representatives do not do what they have said they would do and that I am walleyed on resolving issues with flight details that get more expensive as time grows closer to the flight dates. I will not be using Hopper services again and I will not be recommending the app to my friends and colleges."
"!!!!!!!!!DO NOT USE HOPPER !!!!!!READ THIS NOW IF YOU ARE THINKINGWe made 2 different bookings with this app for our summer to Europe from Canada . One of our flight ran into over lapping date issue right away (basically can't be in two place at the same time) any other app or website would have detach that error right away and they admit to us that it was their mistake but will not be able to refund or exchange anything. Our 2nd flight cost us around 2000USD and we got to the airport in Canada they were not able to pull our names from the system, Basically no booking was confirmed and we got lucky and was being arrange to fly out under the airline arrangment(No help from Hopper ) then the worst happened with our returning flight,we got to the airport again being told our booking was cancelled and we need to contact our agency,but their service are only from 7am to 12. With different time zone we were stuck in the airport for 9 hours before we could hear from them(We already missed our flight) . We had all our confirmation codes and yet was not able get on our flight .All 3 Airlines that we were suppose to fly with said our agency book our tickets wrong . We wrote them over 10 mails and all they will say ""What ever happened was cause by the airline and we had no control or way of knowing exactly what happened there.""  In our case we stood at the airport watching our flight depart and we spent the next 9 hours calling all airlines,additional transportation, hotel ,long overseas calls and a whole lot of stress to rebook our flight . We were exteremly lucky air canada understood our situation and rebook our tickets without charge but we would have had to book an other flight for over 1000Euro .Hopper' s app might be easy to use and keep track of the price but when it comes to booking the actual flight it not trustworthy. I regret not doing more research before I book with them and spending my effort here to warn every traveller . It was an horrible experience with them and if you are still reading this good for you doing some research and please just safe yourself some troubles book with other agency. And if anyone had similar experiences and look for more case to sue them please feel free to contact us ,we will be more than happy to share our case."
Keep in mind that Hopper does NOT have Delta Air Lines fares. They don't have Southwest of course but that's common.
"Hopper IS just another third party ticketing agent and if you buy through them, you WILL be opening yourself up to all the potential problems that can be associated with such purchases. My experience with their customer service is that they say they need to check on things and call you back. Then never call back. They have wasted allot of my time."
"I've used it multiple times now, with great results. I've booked flights to India multiple times & just used it for a flight to Europe. Fares were great! Liked that I was notified and updated on pricing & whether to book or wait for better fares. I checked out the airlines as to their reputation, plus checked on specific airlines & other sites to see if the rates were cheaper. Had a great flight on Etihad to India in the spring for a fantastic fly low fare & just came back from a Europe trip via. Finnair, also a good experience & fare. Like any search app, it's always good to compare, including going directly to airline being advertised."
I used it and I found a great deal to Barbados from NY. The service charge was only $5. I liked using hopper.
"I just used ir for the first time and I booked to flight to Rome in 1500 us and when I looked for the same flight in Alitalia, ten minutes later, the flight was 1200 us. So, I will never buy through them again. My advise follow the prices but check other sites once the price is at the point you are looking for"

Is the hopper app safe to book a flight?Please informTIA
Seems it only give rates for AA
"Hi there Sonya,That's a great question - you can certainly use the Hopper app to search and watch for prices for flights. It is not necessary to book in the Hopper app, but sometimes we have the best deals compared to airlines.If you have more questions, just let us know!Best,Hopper Support Team"
Have not booked tickets through Hopper but have watched flights - didn't find it helpful as it told me I could save several hundred dollars by waiting a few weeks - several days later (when ticket prices had already gone up) told me to buy immediately as prices were going up.
"Hi there Meenotid,That's a great question! Yes, the Hopper app is safe to book through - These prices are real. There are no hidden fees or gotcha charges. Most importantly, we are an accredited travel agency, which means there are real humans behind Hopper who can help you with your booking. :)If you have any other questions please let me know!-Hopper Support"
"Hi there ldygnv2001,Hopper currently offers flights through many carriers including AA and many others - we are also working on expanding the carriers we offering through the app, so keep an eye out for more to come!Let me know if I can answer any other questions. :)"
I wish I could give a zero. Booked an Airberlin flight through them. Arrived at Chicago O'hare airport (after a 5 hour drive from Ky) to learn Airberlin had went out of business. I called Hopper's customer service line who said they sent an email stating the flight would be cancelled. I never received an email stating this information from them. Reading through the other reviews shows that this issue of informing customers of cancellations is systemic and not a one time thing. I was also informed (after 1 hour and 1/2 on the phone) That they would not issue a refund and there was nothing they would do about it. They suggested I just purchase tickets through another site if I wanted to get to Germany. Which I did. I will never use this company again.
"Edis, there have been problems reported with other companie,s including airlines themselves, not infomrin gcustomers about cancelled or rescheduled flights. I guess it's the nature of email communications. Messages can go astray, even with the best will in the world. Hopper may be worse than the avergae, I don't know, but the point is that it's bette rto be proactive and keep any eye on any flights you've booked via the airline website.Third parties won't refund customers unless and until the airline has refunded them. In the case of a bankruptcy as with Air Berlin, I suspect that there will be no refund from the airline at all."
"I love hopper. I don't book flights through it normally because it charges you $5 more for their service to book through them, but I use their watch feature to get notified. Then when I see the flights, I book through Hotwire or the airline company itself."
"""Booked an Airberlin flight through them. Arrived at Chicago O'hare airport ..."" - Obviously without checking the airline sites to follow the status of your itinerary as you are supposed to do."
"I trusted it to tell me when to book, and I'm sorry that I did. It keeps telling me to wait, and our tickets went from 750.00 to over 1000.00. Now Time is running out, and we have to book at horribly high price."
I have and they totally screwed up my ticket so bad - I just ended up leaving the airport and didn't get to fly out. I bought a round-trip ticket to Providence RI and United said that Hopper only bought me a one-way ticket for Newark NJ. Customer service is only available certain times of the day. Also the first customer service rep I spoke with wasn't even in the US. She was very confused! After I reached back out to customer service several times - they kept blaming the airline and the airline told me this was a problem with Hopper. It is a total scam. The Airline refunded their portion but hopper never did. I would not use again!!! Buyer beware!!!
"Don't waste your time or money!!! My wife saw them on a tv show and told me to try them. I did, what a huge mistake. I booked a two-way flight to Providence RI and when I arrived at the airport, I was issued a one-way ticket to Newark NJ. I immediately called Hopper and their customer service wasn't open. My flight out was scheduled for 6 am but their offices didn't open till eight. So I called the airline and they told me that Hopper only bought me a one-way ticket to New Jersey. Apologized for any confusion and tried to help me but I would've had to pay three times my ticket Price. When I finally got a hold of Hopper, the customer service rep could barely speak English and that lead to a very confused and frustrating conversation. To make a long story short, United blamed Hopper and Hopper blamed United and told me that I should speak with United if I was frustrated and gave me an 800# to call. In the end, United did refund my money but Hopper didn't refund any others. Total scam I would not trust or fly with them again."
"Don't waste your time - Hopper is a total scam!!! DON""T TRUST THEM WITH YOUR MONEY!!!"
This is the first time using it. I bought a ticket to Spain and I just checked the airline and everything seems to be good. I will be leaving in 2 weeks.
"I just booked through the Hopper App. I had it watching a flight for me and when I hit search for flights for the watched flight, it showed me exactly what airlines. I booked so I hope it is legit!"
Why do you say this? I just booked an Int'l flight with them and saved $300. I then contacted the Airlines that Hopper booked me through and the airlines verified that my flight is booked with them. Please share your experience.
"The hopper app is garbage and can't be trusted. I had a flight out to Dominican Republic and the time changed. Hopper never notified me but accepted the change on my behalf. Needless to say I missed my flight. Hopper would not even try to accommodate me. They said they emailed me and when I didnt acknowledge it they accepted on my behalf. If I didnt accept, why not call or text? More importantly why not update the app with the new time? On top of that the custpmer service was flat out disgusting. They're not worth the $7 they charge in commission. Don't waste your time money or energy!"
"<They said they emailed me and when I didnt acknowledge it they accepted on my behalf. If I didnt accept, why not call or text? >Because that's not what they say they will do. They tell you to check your email and then your carrier's website.https://support.hopper.com/hc/en-us/articles…<Will Hopper keep me up to date on changes to my flight? Yes, Hopper will notify you via email of any schedule changes or cancellations to flights you've booked on Hopper.If your flight has been modified or canceled, it will be noted in the app as well. For the most recent changes, check your email. You can also access your itinerary via the airline's website, using the airline confirmation code we provided in your confirmation email.>"
"Hopper is not trustworthy at least and at best they are just a cog in the big wheel of the modern digital world attempting to bring savings but in the mean time they are deceptive. I went to book a flight and found the price immediately jump over 15% when I went to book. I reloaded the app because I thought it was an error and the same thing occurred. True the money went to United and I disputed the Hopper fee of only $10( it also took no less than three hours to actually get the app to work with the help of customer support manual authorizing my account.) United said that they have many examples of the 3rd parties boosting prices at the time of booking but they, United, by law only offer one price. Hopper did not admit to any price hopping ( ha ha) But it was clear that they put out the best offer below price and changed immediately upon booking. They say next time get a screen shot. I heard Google flights is the best and I found just fly offering better prices immediately and better flights after I fell for their little bait and switch. Amazing what they will do for a $5 fee which became 10 on two tix. On the other hand I was told that while UA gets the money for the bulk of the listing, these companies often will buy blocks of inventory with heavy restrictions. This booking had many restrictions and pulled me in by making it more appear more urgent than it was."
"""But it was clear that they put out the best offer below price and changed immediately upon booking. ""---It's simply because they don't have access to live pricing. So when you went to book, the lower advertised fare wasn't available."
"Sunmagic is completely right, John. What's more, Hopper are far from the only company that do this. Very few third parties actually have live prices advertised. I believe it costs them too much, and they scrape by on thin margins as it is."
"Thanks for your feedback! We're adding more and more carriers as we grow, so you're likely to see more than just American Airlines offered in the app :)"
We're sorry to hear that you may not have had the best experience with the Hopper app. We're working on building an amazing support team to better serve our customers. Please feel free to reach out to us so that we can take a look into the situation. We'd be happy to help!
We're really sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our support team. That's definitely what we don't want to hear. Please feel free to reach out to us again so that we can work to remedy the situation.
"I've used this site twice. Got a good price for Geneva- Miami round trip. They do offer many possibilities and keep you up to date as to prices and when to book. Not all airlines are used though ( easy jet, Norwegian). There are no extra fees ( maybe $10 for credit card?) like some online companies ( edreams charges $41 per person + crdiet card). Our second reservation was mixed with vueling, a low cost airline, and we were never informed of a €35 charge for a bag one way!!! With our experience and others, go directly with the airline to avoid surprises and to be sure. Perhaps just get an idea with Hopper."
"NO, it is not!! I ""followed"" three flights to see how it would work, but in the end I booked the flight for that trip with another company. In the last two weeks I find my credit card has been charged for all of the the flights I followed! Foolishly I entered my credit card details on the Hopper app which of course I should not have done unless I was actually booking one of the flights. DON'T TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGEPOLE!!"
"I hope you have contacted your card provider to see if they can help at all, Roger."
"I tried Hopper for the first time a couple of months ago. I started watching a trip to Victoria Falls and at the time, the RT price was ~$1080. Hopper advised me to wait as the price was expected to go down by the 2nd week in Dec. I have been checking the price every day and the price keeps going up--as of today, it's over $1600. I doubt the price will go much lower in the next couple of weeks and I'm disappointed that I didn't book when it was $1080. I won't be using Hopper again."
"I noticed the problem straight away and notified the CC company, so I imagine i will not be paying those charges."
"So, how ended up, did you have a good experience?"
"I've used Hopper and not only did we get unbelievably cheap flights from Vancouver to Dublin via United/Aer Lingus, but when United Canceled the first leg of our flight a week before departure, Hopper arranged for a far better option for us immediately. Their customer service agent, Camilo, was fast, friendly and more than helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hopper, in fact, I'll sing their praises. Their app is really easy to use, and their methods for tracking the best prices and/or routes seems pretty great."
"@kimmdo7 Thank you for your feedback regarding this issue. We're sorry to hear that your price prediction was not accurate or seems to be behaving strangely! That being said, we'd like to investigate this further with you, so please feel free to reach out to our support team at support@hopper.com so that we can take a look :)"
@Roger A:Something definitely doesn't sound right here! Please reach out to our support team at support@hopper.com so we can look into this with you and remedy the situation.
"Hopper is TrustWorthy. I am a junior in College and I study biology I do not work for them or something. Anyway I live in the US but I am an international student from Cote D Ivoire, it is a country in Africa and the average round trip ticket to my country is $2000 it can be higher though yet I got it with Hopper for $1400. I went home last Christmas. I was afraid before booking with them you know I had never heard of them before but it went well. Right after I paid with them, I called the airport to verify my booking and they had me, everything looked good. It is cheaper because you have a lot of stops but it was worth it. I got to go back home and everything and I enjoyed using Hopper. I was even able to call them all the way from my country, back in Africa. I would recommend it to anyone.One Tip: around midnight or so, the prices tend to drop majorly, that is when I how mine so cheapHope I was any help :)"
You people must think we are really naive.
Really !
"Myrna, I'm afraid it's always a bit suspicious when someone joins TA and on the very same day they head straight for a thread in which a company is being criticised, then submit a very supportive post of that company.Perhaps it might help you to be seen as genuine if you explain how you found TA, the forums and this very thread? Even experienced TA users sometimes don't know about hese discussion boards."
"Not a new user and I have had great luck with Hopper on multiple trips! Just wanted to drop my two cents as a long time tripadvisor user. I sometimes don't have the patience to wait until the price drops, but on most trips I have continued to watch the prices and they eventually do drop to right around where Hopper predicts. If nothing else, why not use it to make an informed decision when purchsing flights directly from an airline? Anyone should watch prices for a bit before booking anyway, this is just a useful tool that notifies you without having to look."
"That is helpful, Snowangl. Perhaps more people should take the time to post about positive experiences.""Kerry"" and ""Myrna"" on the other hand are obviously the work of Hopper itself - they do their own public relations, this ladyprnewsonline.com/awards/2014risingprstars_Sc…In a thread which asks ""Is it trustworthy"" to find the enterprize resorting to bald lies provides its own answer."
"I disagree with any company posing as a user to promote their product/brand. Unfortunately, less than stellar practices like this happen all the time. There are millions of paying jobs for people to post positive reviews all over the internet. This is why it is hard to trust someone on here that hasn't been around for a while. In this case though, that cannot be proven - just surmised. With that being said, as someone who works in marketing, Hoppers goal of coverage in the article you linked is smart. PR is extremely important to any company's survival. So I don't knock them for this alone."
"I'm sure people can make their own decisions on whether posts are gneuine or not. To me, companie spretending to be users does them no credit at all, though I understand the motivations behind such action and I accept that it is extremely widespread.I continue to believe, however, that this kind of behaviour is ultimately self defeating for the company."
"Hi all, My name is sanjay pandita . The hopper conned me so that i had to pay 600 $ more for my flight. When i complained they told me i responsible for visa even if they book my flight for any stop in between. They are conning people. I work in Tata Consultancy Services and have shared my story so that nobody from my company is Conned by them ."
I was worried too! I just bought tickets for my daughter at an amazing price for Christmas. she got an email right from the airlines after purchasing through hopper and things went off without a hitch ! I highly recommend!
"That's great to hear @Sandra! If you or your daughter have any questions about your booking, please feel free to contact us a support@hopper.com. We're always happy to help!"
I just heard about the site and tried for about 20 minutes to download and attempt tp use their app for about 20 minutes then gave up. They seem to have constant download and connectivity problems with whatever servers(s) they are using so I’m really cautious now to make any further attempts to book a flight. Sorry Hopper. You lose.
Do not book via hopper use it to get the price trend and then contact any travel agent or airline directly. Hopper is a con app.
I downloaded and am wondering if it's safe to buy too. After you click on your trip it takes you to prices of a ton of different airlines.
@Don GThanks for letting us know about that! We value your feedback and would love to help solve this issue with you. Please feel free to contact us a support@hopper.com so that we can take a look in to what might be preventing your phone from downloading the app. We'd be happy to help!
@Hannah KPlease feel free to reach out to our support team at support@hopper.com and we'd be happy to help you with any questions or concerns you may have! :)
"Downloaded the app, checked the prices for a bunch of flights and then compared them to the results in google flights, hopper always had more expensive tickets, uninstalled the app.For instance STO<->BKK. Same flights, Hopper €610, google flights €490."
"I have used hopper several times to fly from Chicago to Durham, and never had a problem. The only issue I encountered was when I went to choose my seats, there were none available without an up-charge. I know this was not a Hopper problem since I booked pretty late, but it would have been nice to know up front that the price they found - was not really the price I was going to pay. Again, the app probably doesn't know how many seats are available. I also use it just for notifications of price drops and then book directly through the airlines."
I’ve used it to alert me to the cheapest tickets and have had great success. I just go directly to the airline and purchase the ticket. I save over $1000 on a flight to Italy.
"Hi Just seeing this in looking for a review on hopper...they are legit and I was super happy when I just booked my trip the other week. I thought they showed you hidden fees for flights, especially the international ones that add on so many extras it ends up being more expensive than most others. But they don’t. I found out after booking and chatting with customer service to make sure it all went through since it was my first time using this app that there were still hidden fees that I was unaware of. I even asked customer service about these specific fees I wanted to avoid since the details were only included once you dig through some airlines websites. I was told no that is the final cost...nope. Not so. We won’t use them anymore. We don’t trust them and after trying for answers with customer service they told me I should have been aware of some random airlines extra fees. I hope this helps..."

"I booked an international flight a Wednesday evening and received an email saying that I will receive the tickets very shortly. On Thursday evening I had nothing. I called the customer support. At my great surprise, they answered immediately, I didn't have to wait. The representative told me that he could see there was an issue and that I will have to wait two to three minutes while he will check with the resolution team. It took at least 5 minutes before he came back but he told me hat they were working on it and asked me to wait some more. Five minutes later he told me that they were in the process of issuing the tickets and asked me to wait some more. About five minutes later he told me that the tickets were issued and that they had send them to me by email. I got the email ten minutes after. I don't know about you, but it has been a long time that I had an issue resolved in one phone call without being cut off !I forgot to mention that the same flight was proposed on Google Flight and Orbitz for the double price !Edited: 2 years ago "
"Not sure how trustworthy - but is it accurate? I booked flights based on advice from Hopper as 'is is the best time to buy, etc,etc' - same flights now considerably cheaper."
At what point can I book thru Hopper? Do I have to wait when the app tells me to book now? Can I also pick my seats thru the app?
"@Cheryl I That's a great question and thanks for your post!You are welcome to book anytime in the app. Our notifications are to give you booking suggestions based on historical data, on when you SHOULD buy your tickets. Sometimes waiting can really pay off! :)To answer your other question--while you can't book the seat numbers directly in the app, you're always welcome to reach out to our support team who'd be happy to check out the seat map for you. Depending on the airline's policies, we may or may not be able to reserve your seats in advance on our end. Please feel free to reach out to our support team at support@hopper.com if you have any further questions. We're always happy to help!"
We have used it for two flights and a friend for one. So far so good. No problems. They charge a nominal fee of $5 per ticket. The only thing I'm noticing is that for one or two tickets it worked great. Now I'm searching for four tickets and I keep getting not enough seats available or the price has gone up by over $50.00
I think the thing about hopper is that is cant identify who is offering to you the best deal....the app merely tries to help you predict when is the best time to travel....you need other tools but it can be useful.
I'm not trusting it. There's a $5 charge on my statement and I'd never even heard of hopper. Looking it up brought me here. I was hoping to find a phone# to ask them to remove the charge. I haven't booked a flight; don't even recall doing any flight searches lately. Not sure how they got me but not happy about it.
"@johnM3381TL, If you want to be cynical about Hopper, that is your prerogative, but I had a great experience and I believe in giving companies great feedback when they go beyond my expectations. Had Hopper's customer service not been so helpful and so insistent on finding a solution that worked best for my family, my experience could have gone drastically different when United cancelled our flight a week before departure. Hence my glowing review. I am a real person who travels often, so please don't paint me as some lackey who was paid to submit a fake write-up. I don't appreciate the slander.Kerry"
That response sounds like you work for an airline. Check this article https://tinyurl.com/y89uegly
"it is a scam, they display an attractive price at the search and immediately when you try to book it, they plat like the search run into an error, by that time you already entered your information ( including credit card number), and when the error magically disappears, oops guess what? the price went up. They are actually engaging in criminal activity and getting away with it ( they collect your information without any promise to protect it, they sell, and god knows what else) but also they try to screw you big time on the price. I would sleep with the devil rather than buying a ticket through them."
Just booked with them for next years trip. Read all the negative reviews. I guess some people don’t read everything because in bold print it states no cancellations or changes allowed. Every complaint I read had to deal with changes or cancelations. It’s a bit of a gamble but I saved over 50% so as long as you can make the flight all is well!
"I used the Hopper App to purchase flights from Venice to Rome. The flights were on Alitalia. I cannot remember what i paid but price was significantly cheaper than what Alitalia advertised and the price included baggage. After purchase I logged into Alitalia online and there was no mention of baggage attached to my reservation.  This worried me, so I contacted Hooper via a chat and was assured that all was well. A week before departure I had an epiphany and I called Alitalia and the rep told me that bags were included with ticket. Not sure why I didn't make that call in the first place smh. All went well and I plan to use the Hopper app again, if the price is right :-)"
Nooooooooo!!!!Liars!!! Thieves!!!!Do Not Do It!
"Absolutely love HOPPER. It watched my Europe trip, scanned for deals, notified me of when to wait and when to buy. Round trip tix from LAX—>London—>Norway—>Lax $612 out the door round trip. Best app ever. Had a name change. No problem. Fixed it. Wanted different seats. No problem. Handled. They rock. I’ll book through them all day long."
"DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!It has honestly been the worst experience and I have been flying for over 20 years. Story: I called to change my flight through Hopper and they found me a flight but since I was on the phone with them for 4 hours waiting, they told me that they would email me the flight itinerary. About 2 hours after I hung up I got the flight itinerary and emailed back right away telling them they had my permission to book the flight using the original credit card that what used for the reservation. I did not hear back so I decided to call them. They then informed that that the fare had gone up $600 and that I would have to change my return flight as well. I asked them why, and they told me that the AIRLINE said it was the rules. Which I had never even heard of so I called the airline directly and they told me that was a lie and there was no rule that has ever stated that. So I called HOPPER and told them that. They said they will try to continue to work with them. I kept calling once everyday for 2 weeks, then they finally found me a flight I could go on 12 hours PRIOR to the departure. So I gave them my credit card number, they charge me for a flight, and I started packing. 4 HOURS PRIOR to departure they called me and told me that the ticket could not be booked because a problem with the airline. Once again I called the airline and they said that the agency had not put anything through. So I called every 4 hours trying to change my flight and check on the progress of my flight. 34 days later they finally found me a flight, charged me card (again) and im now less than 48 hours out from my departure time and once AGAIN am being told by the airline DELTA that HOPPER has not changed my flight. So I am now waiting 2 hours on the phone with HOPPER waiting for them to resolve my issue. DO NOT BOOK WITH HOPPER!!! Use it to check the prices, but then directly use the airline to book your tickets."
"I have booked a few times with hopper. The price obviously depends on the airlines and your destination but for me, Hopper was a little cheaper than any other website. It also shows you the fare rates, so you can see the rates there. Hopper has taken about 3 Euros of commission for my last two flights, where the airline's official website took 5 EUR commission. I don't think it's a scam by any chance."
I love hopper i use them all the time
"Do you have to pay for the entire at checkout, or can you make payments?"
"Do you have to pay the entire amount at checkout, or can you make payments?"
"Cool, a friend mine use hopper from Seattle to Hawaii without a problem, I never used myself, thank you to share that was ok with you, best regards"
"Ive used this service when i went to hawaii the last 3 times, you just have to put in a date and watch it because you will get your plane ticket cheaper if you wait plus it will notify you all the time when they think you should buy it. The last time i went over ( A couple months ago ) I saved 50% off what any other ticket would have cost thru the airlines. It is a great site in my opinion."
"Watch to make sure Hopper doesn't automatically book you a return flight you don't want and bill your credit card. Happened to me twice. Trustworthy? I guess so. Competent? Well, the problem is that this country is being run by children. s/ Jimmy the Toucan"
"You pay in full, just as you would on an airline's site.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hopper rip me off $800 when I change my date. I did not have option.I do not recomended. Only like reference, then you buy straight for the airline.They never will answer a call. Only they will call you to rip you off the money.They are the nightmare. Never ever ever...God help me"
"Similar to queenvalley, a friend and I booked tickets based on Hopper's low fare notification. I booked directly from the airline's website, my friend went through Hopper. She received a confirmation email with a confirmation number, however sometime between booking the flight and the day before (when we went to check-in) Hopper had sent her an email saying that something had changed with her flight information. She never saw that email (probably went to spam) and because she never responded she was dropped from the flight. It cost her several hundred dollars more to get her ticket back - fortunately a seat was still available the day before. It was a nightmare for her and I never had any problem since buying mine directly from the airline."
"I have used Hopper several times and made out very well (cheapest flights available, regular noticed of changes in pricing. Good wait vs buy advice). I just got screwed though and will now be rethinking it. Situation: Bought 2 tickets via Hopper on Frontier Airline and was hit with $97 fee/ticket when checking in online.This fee was for seats (yes, unbelievable right?), checked bags, carry on bags etc. The fee is bundled as some kind of money saving perk.complete BS. When I tried to check in w/o buying the bundle the individual fees for each were outrageous. $80/bag greater than. 24 hrs b4 flight. $85 w/in 24 hr window. Seats ranged from $35 to $50 each. And no answer when I tried to call."
"Listening to the Doctors T.V. show this morning and they had a lady on recommending this app. and how it could save you money; also alert you when prices dropped. Original network: SyndicationExecutive producers: Travis Lane Stork, Andrew P. Ordon, MORENominations: Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host,"
I’m not a fan. I saw a flight and it told me I would save money if I waited. I looked daily and the prices kept rising. I wound up paying almost double the price.
Feels like a scam. I found tickets a number of times. As soon as all my details are entered flight prices shoot up. Go direct to the airline and they haven’t. I didn’t believe it’s coincidence. Personally will never use them again. Deleted app and will expose their tactic. Don’t take my word. Try for yourself
"Hey,Just booked with Hopper. I guess reading all these reviews there is positive and negative ones. When you book just go directly to 'managing your booking' with the airline company and use the email you received from Hopper to check the details on the original website of the airline you booked with. For me flying Amsterdam - Bangkok through Hopper the reservation went fine. I'm flying in October but already logged in with Malaysia Airlines for the confirmation. Everything is ok."
"I am new to Hopper and recently had it recommended to me by a person that does extensive traveling. The benefit is to alert you to drops in price and the best time to buy. One point that I questioned was if they were aligned with an Airline. I recently put in a trip to NYC and all the flight suggestions were for United Airlines only!?! For another flight to Alabama the current price was $761 but I found a flight on Delta (at their website) for $350, so I'm still not sure about Hopper."
"I've been seeing Hopper ads that look very appealing, saying they use big data to predict the cheapest times to fly. It's weird how when I google reviews, most of them have had similar experiences, but the app store says it has 4.8 stars (although the reviews displayed on its download page are all 3* or less??).Thanks, everyone, for sharing your experiences—I'm not happy you had to go through that, but you've helped me make a firm decision not to consider Hopper."
"Hi! My question is, I haven't seen if you can choose, economy, business, or first class. I don't want to assume, but; since it is a site that gets you great air deals, do they only offer economy?"
"Wow—there’s something wrong with you. P.S. I’m skeptical about the app, and worried about my dates so I haven’t made final purchase yet, but I CAN say at least half of that isn’t true, which makes you a liar. What’s your problem? Got fired? Ex boyfriend works there? Geez."
No. They were unable to process my flight but still charged me a commission on my credit card. No way to contact them. Their phone number in Cambridge MA does not work and they do not answer e-mails. SCAM.
Replying to Cosmopolitan674031:That’s normal for Frontier. They’re charter flights. I used to work for a vacation booking outfit and they worked with frontier a lot. You have to pay for baggage and to choose your seats. Not a hopper thing.Edited: 1 year ago 
"I am also flying to HI, what was your baggage fee? Where you happy with everything?"
"I've used Hopper since I heard about it. It hasn't let me down, yet. The only thing about Hopper is that you are not able to book tickets for the same flight for multiple people. Hopper is great for people who travel alone, hence why I like it so much. If you're someone who travels alone and really does not care about about seating, flight perks, etc, then this is the app for you.As far as canceling your flight or your flight getting canceled, Hopper will let you know if you need to check your itinerary and will actually direct you (if needed) to the Airline's (the one booked for flight) website if you want more details on your flight. When you book your flight at the given price it will not charge you extra if the price goes up. You are able to watch flights and their prices and if you enable notifications for Hopper. It will give you estimates of the best time to buy your ticket and tell you if prices will rise. I hope this helps!"

"i was told to use hopper, and its telling me to wait that in the next 6 weeks the price will drop with more than a $100, so what should I do?"
"Hopper uses searches of current prices, plus historical data on what MAY happen in the future, based on what has happened in the past.I tend to use Hopper to set alerts for me and watch certain flights/dates, when something comes up that looks good, I go to the airlines website and book through there.No one can tell you what you should do. If you wait, you might save $100, but the price may also go up for some reason.Also, keep in mind, unless you have set up filters, the prices you are shown are for basic economy-seat choice and checked luggage will be extra."
"i dont know about the filters but yes i know its basic economy. my flight is till april and since they tell me wait for the next 6 weeks, i hope is because with black friday sales may come up"
I just booked two people on the same itinerary...
I love this app. In August 2018 I put in dates for a trip in late March 2019. Every once in a while I would get an updated notice that prices had come down but I should wait. So I did. Yesterday I was notified that flights had lowered and I should book as they were not likely to get any lower. Tickets were almost $200 less - for one - than the same trip last year.
Hello there I have been using hopper for the last two years. They have been easy to use and i have always found i get the best price when they tell me. They also let me know if i am just searching for a good deal when the best time to buy is. The only thing i wish they had or were a part of is a points system. Like aeroplan or airmiles where if you booked with them you got airpoints.
Can you use hopper to search any destination? As in some apps say “anywhere” and then give various destinations.
"@Cathie E That's a great question! While we don't have an option to select ""Fly Anywhere"" at this time, this is a feature that we'd love to implement in the future. In the meantime, you can search for cities all around the world, and we will notify you when the flights to those cities have great deals! Happy Travels!"
"DO NOT USE HOPPER!!!! There are hidden fees that you will find out at the time of travel (a shady practice that will cause you stress just as you are beginning your vacation and trying to relax). If you use the app to keep watch on fares, then go to the airline website directly and book it at the best price you can get while knowing that what you pay up front is actually what you pay, period. I was burned by this experience. DO NOT TRUST THEM!"
"Be careful. I hope you had a good experience, but I did not. I paid a minimally lower price through Hopper, but at the time of travel there were hidden fees. By the time all was said and done, the cost to fly was the same as if I had booked directly through the airline but if I had done that to begin with at least I wouldn't have had all the last minute stress because of Hopper. I won't use them again."
"No, don't do it!"
I heard about this app via glowing reviews from NYTimes Travel section. I am not using it to book flights but just to keep track of and be notified of prices for specific itineraries I am interested in. The main reason to use it is for their predictions that specific fares will go up or down. I use their filters to filter out “basic” fares - the ones with all the hidden fees for “extras” like seat selection. What I am wondering is how reliable their predictions are. I am looking at a flight to Miami in January and it keeps telling me to wait because fares will go down. Hope they’re right. I have non-refundable hotel reservations. When it is time to book I will book directly. I can say that the fares their search turns up match exactly to the fares I see on airline website. Which is definitely not my experience with Google flights!
"I'm watching for Christmas fares and they've been telling me to wait for lower prices for a month. So far, prices have only gone up & I'm a bit nervous. It's highly unusual for prices to drop closer to Christmas than earlier out. I hope to goodness I'm not being led astray. Kayak is saying prices will increase in next 7 days."
If you’re looking for fares for this Christmas I’d be very surprised if they came down now when it’s less than four weeks away.
"I wouldn’t reccomend using them to actually book a flight. For a simple incorrect last name I wanted to change that I booked through them, they were no help. KLM said it must be changed via the booking agent. Hopper said it was the airline’s job. The result: I lost a 700$ ticket. Use them only to find the cheapest days to fly, then book through the airlines. Hopper won’t/can’t help if there’s a problem later...."
"Everything is fine until you actually need to get in touch with Hopper support to help you with an issue. I view booking apps such as Hopper as passengers’ agent and I CHOSE that particular app’s employees to represent me for a trip - I bought a rebookable ticket for a CAD $200 rebooking fee, so Hopper’s agent’s answer that booking is out of their control is unacceptable."
I have used hopper many many times and have NEVER had a problemThey delivered exactly what I booked and paid for and only had to call them once with a question and had excellent customer service.
I am in need of a cheap flight to Miami on Feb 15th. Rates are high but Hopper is telling me to wait. I am afraid that if I keep waiting the price is going to keep going up? Hopper claims rate will drop on Jan 19th. Can I trust this and wait?
Hopper really disappointed me. I should have booked my flight a week ago when I wanted to. I listened to Hopper and waited. Hopper and a Crystal Ball work about the same way.Forget this app. Book as early as you can and that's when the price is the cheapest. The longer you wait the more you will pay.
I've tried hopper and I don't think it very reliable. I am going to New Orleans this March and when I went to buy my rt tix months ago at about $385 the app said to wait they will go down to $285. I never got an alert for tix at that price and its been telling me to wait for lower prices since. The prices never went as low as $285 or I didn't get the notif for it. So now I'm going to be stuck paying over $500 for rt tix from Chicago to NOLA.
"I've noticed that Hopper isn't reliable as it used to be. I would never use it to book flights directly(You should always book direct with the airlines).In the past, I would save tremendously with Hopper alerts. Now in the past 6 months, it has told me to wait to book, while prices increased dramatically. Then all of a sudden, it would switch to book now. I now like to use Google Flights and I will go back to Kayak for price tracking. The software that Hopper uses isn't good anymore."
"Been watching a flight to Italy for a few months.. same price.. it keeps saying in the next 3 weeks prices will drop, and after March 9th go up $140. Getting nervous! Leaving in April!!"
Oh it does thanks
I have had no issues with booking and using the hopper app. I even confirmed my flight with the airlines to make sure that I had a ticket and all is good. Got a flight for my family of 5 during Easter to Italy and was cheaper than Expedia for everything including hotel.
How was spirit airlines...I've Seen nothing but bad reviews and they are voted the worst amongst the top rated critics
"I completely agree with your comments! Hopper is not trustworthy, and is completely ridiculous to deal with. Just as bad as Norwegian Air customer service."
"A big major NO!!! Hopper is not Trustworthy.I booked four tickets for four different people with Hopper.There are four legs to each ticket.I emaled then that I would like to change one leg if the trip for only one person.They did not get back to me,!, Also when you call their customer service number you get sone obnoxious music playing in your ear with the same 8 count annoyingly playing over and over.They never interrupt the tape to tell you what your hold time is and they never offer you to leave your phone number for a call back.You are not allowed to change the flight with the airlines be only with hopper.They are impossible to get a hold of.Stay away from them at all costs!!’!"
Agreed use them for pricing. Book directly through the actual flight company.Edited: 1 year ago 
"I just waited 27 minutes on hold... So I started down the path of doubt.ALLIE from Hopper answered and was super DIPLOMATIC and wonderful. Solved everything in minutes.The long wait time was due to the ""Max"" jets being grounded and 100s of people calling to rescheduling flights.Go HOPPER:)"
"Worst app ever!!! Doesn't work if you live in HAWAII. Awful, uninstalled it 5 frustrated minutes after installing. I would not trust it at all."
"I haven't used Hopper for a couple of years now, and it sounds like perhaps its algorithm for suggesting flights might be compromised now, but when I DID use it back in 2017 and 2016, I had no issues whatsoever with either the app itself or the tickets I ended up buying through it. Bummer to hear it doesn't seem to be working as well for people now...c'est la vie, I guess. Agree it's probably still worth looking at for pricing, though I think they were able to secure lower fares because your itinerary tended to be a little more drawn out and/or had you go through lower-demand airports, so I'm not sure the low fares they show would necessarily be achievable if you go directly through the airlines...but maybe you could replicate their itineraries and get the same price? Aaaand now I'm just rambling. :) Good luck, all! Happy travels, however you get there."
Definitely does not seem like it. I'd avoid it https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hopper.com
"Worst company ever! Don’t use! They messed up my booking, we booksd a private taxi they turned up with shuttle instead of the private taxi. They turned up at 3:30 instead of the time I booked which was 04:10am. The driver rushed us to get ready and was angry at us, driver would not look at our booking to see if something went wrong. I Called in to get some help they would not help. Stay away."
"Do NOT trust this app. I waited, and waited checked flight prices through Hopper and competitors as well daily for 4 months. The app would tell me to wait, the price would drop to half the price listed, instead of $900 it would be $450. It was a lie. My trip is now just a few weeks away. Tje prices never dropped. Hopped never notified me to purchase. I should have bought the tickets 4 months ago at $600. With 8 of us flying that's alot of money waisted, trusting an app. This was for an international fligh, peak Season."
"This is absolutely NOT a trustworthy company. Do not book with them if you want to actually go on the trip you planned on the dates you booked. They keep changing the flights, including dates and duration of the trip for no apparent reason. They blame the airline, the airline blames them. In the end you are out hundreds of dollars."
"I leave for Spain in 8 days. Over 6 months ago, I bought tickets for this trip from Hopper. My travel time to Spain was approximately 17 hours. Today, EIGHT DAYS before my flight, Hopper emailed me with a change in my itinerary. Now, my tickets leave a full day earlier, but arrive at the same time. I would be leaving on WEDNESDAY and arriving on FRIDAY. So now I have over 14 hours of layover for reasons completely out of my control.Quite simply: Hopper appears fraudulent to me. This is my first (and LAST) time using Hopper's service but it seems as if Hopper charges a higher price for a better ticket and then switches it last minute without compensating their customers.Do not use Hopper.Edited: 1 year ago "
"No, it's not trustworthy. I had been using Hopper for a while, and it was fine. Then I have a trip planned for a couple months from the time I am watching flights, and prices spike, Hopper is telling me it's the best time to buy because they are going to either remain the same or go up further (at this point they were ~$400 per ticket rt). I purchase this through the Hopper app itself. Three days later, I get an alert from the app that there's been a price drop, to $198!!!. This was three days later....off by $200. I reach out to Support, they give me the run around and tell me they can't do anything because they are beholden to the airline prices, and there is no guarantee of the accuracy of their predictions. I was not accepting this as an answer, as them issuing a refund or reimbursement has nothing to do with the airline, it's about taking care of your customers and taking responsibility for when your app doesn't do what it claims it does. I was told a week and half ago my request was being raised to their leadership and they'll get back to me as soon as possible. I still have not heard back.I continue to get alerts that the price is in the $200s. It's been like this for 2 weeks now. The fact they are not doing anything for a once loyal customer when their app is so incorrect speaks volumes about the company. They suddenly fall into the ""we're just 3rd party, we can't do anything"" garbage expedia pulls. But this is different, they are claiming to get you the best prices at the best times, and when that algorithm doesn't work, they throw up their hands and say, oh well, it's not really trustworthy and it's just the risk you run using us. Oh, all right then. I guess there's no reason to trust your app or use it ever again. They don't care about their customers, and are little more than a 3rd party booking company with a gimmicky branding that doesn't actually mean anything, and can end up costing you hundreds of dollars, and they won't care."
"Hi Sean, It sounds like you're expecting their crystal ball to be 100% effective when they say that it isn't.""it's about taking care of your customers and taking responsibility for when your app doesn't do what it claims it does.""According to the big text on their website they say they have 95% accuracy in price prediction. That would imply that at least some of the time they might not be correct. They don't claim to be 100% accurate. You mentioned that you've used it quite a bit and have been happy with the success you've had so far, so it sounds like it's been giving you good predictions most of the time. In their terms and conditions https:/… that you would've agreed to, they make it pretty clear that they aren't always right and do nothing for bad predictions: ""our price forecasts are merely the best guess that we can provide at any given time based on existing data and past trends. There is no guarantee that our forecasts will be correct .... Accordingly, while you may choose to rely on our forecasts, we do not and cannot guarantee their accuracy, and accept no responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur from your reliance, including loss of chance or differences in pricing"""
Do not trust Hopper!! I attempted to book a trip to Croatia and after I did a few months later they changed my flight. The first time was a slight change in time which was fine with me but then they did it a second time but now it was a day earlier and didn’t provide me with information for how to cancel or change my flight back. Since then they have been extremely difficult to work with and have lied to me about the process to receive a refund. I spoke with the airline multiple times to confirm that Hopper has mislead me. I will never use them again.
"People are so silly...the app does work, and well at that. Like any flight tracking app or website that runs stats on prices for routes - they're all simply PREDICTIONS, so they can never be 100% accurate when suggesting to ""book now"" or to ""wait"". The same goes for Kayak, Skiplagged, Expedia, etc.I've used Hopper and booked flights for 4 separate occasions, typically when flying between Canada and the USA. If you're overly concerned about booking on a third party website, then don't. My suggestion to you is if you want to take the risk, right after booking, look up your confirmation ID directly on the airline's website (""manage my itinerary"") ...this will tell you if it really went through or not - and this goes for ANY third party booking site, NOT JUST Hopper. From my experiences, I've used hopper to guide me to when the price drops (and booked on other websites like Expedia, to get my gold member points). In other scenarios, I have booked directly on the Hopper app. For the instances where I have booked directly on the Hopper app, I have flown seamlessly from Medford, Oregon, USA to Toronto, Ontario, Canada on two occasions (with United Airlines in Jan 2019 and April 2019) and from San Antonio, TX to Toronto (with American Airlines). I have also booked two other flights for the future: another from Reno, Nevada to Toronto (United Airlines in Aug 2019) and Miami to Toronto (July 2019). In all honesty, I've had MUCH LESS headache through Hopper than other OTAs. To be fair, though, none of my flight itineraries have changed dramatically in timing (if only by a few minutes), requiring me to use Hopper's customer service to cancel or change a flight. I typically use Hopper to book flights that are no later than a couple months out, though. The only form of negative commentary that I will say about Hopper is that it does not notify me about flight check-in 24 hours before I'm expected to fly as other OTAs typically do. In the grand scheme of things, though, that is very minor, as my e-mail inbox automatically syncs flight itineraries that I have booked to my calendar.With respect to pricing, I have saved as much as $350 CAD per one way ticket or as little as $50 CAD using Hopper when comparing the same itinerary other OTAs such as Expedia, Flighthub, Momondo, Kiwi and Skiplagged."
Thank you!! They were hundreds of dollars more than skyscanner. Dont know why so many rave about them!
"Well I have been following a flight that was $129 and told not to purchase yet, just got a notification it is now $169. I waited and now will overpay $40 per ticket. I would not wait per their direction."
How often is Hopper going to charge the $5.00 from my card? I've used their services several times to purchase tickets however I was unaware that I was going to be charged the $5.00 so now I want to know how often I am going to be charged that fee.
"Dawn, I suggest you go to their site and read their terms that you signed up to. It will likely tell you about their charges and frequency. Most regulars on here wouldn’t use something like that, we book directly with the airline."
"I used hopper to get our June flights to Mexico from Dulles airport. We got the tickets for a slightly better prince then booking directly with United airlines. However, Hopper charged us extra for an assigned seat but United is not honoring that. I tried to chat with Hopper but their chat is never active and you have to email or sit on the p hone waiting for someone to answer. I am sorry we booked through Hopper ."
Beware Hopper has non existent customer service. They finally replied to me Two Days after I asked for help. They screwed me out of 200 pounds just by not communicating anything b a timely fashion. The airline was willing to change my ticket. Hopper just was not available to cooperate. Never Nevet trust them
"I took a flying leap and booked 3 RT flights to Paris for myself and my daughters for a May trip plus a RT for myself to Raleigh to meet them and enjoyed huge savings: $1500! Hopper found me 3 economy Paris flights with very decent travel times for $500. You can’t beat that. I booked through the Hopper Ap. I tried to make no changes, I read all the airline rules on baggage for my flight and there were no surprises or glitches. American Airlines let me choose our seats (from a limited selection) for $30 more and we did on one leg of the flight. I called Hopper once when I couldn’t check in on AA’s web site. A lady told me to Google “manage my booking American Airlines” and I was able to access it immediately by typing in the AA reservation number Hopper gave me. Hopper gets a big thumbs up from me."
Hopper is telling me the flight is going to drop significantly in a week. Is this reliable>?
Can Hopper tell me what the winning lottery numbers are going to be?!
don’t use it. they won’t let you book until they send a verification link. things change between your choices and the link they send
"I wanted to book a flight from LAX to OGG (Hawaii) for two adults and two children in Aug/Sep 2019. Two months ago Hopper indicated flights were $562 and directed me to wait. They dropped to $468 - still wait. Dropped to $398 - still wait. Went back up to $562 (ugh!!) - still wait. Just dropped today to $248 - direct me to BUY!. I did. Saved me approximately $1,000!! By the way the airline's website showed the fares at $468. I don't get it. But I'll take it!"
"I’ve used Hopper several times... but what I do is let it search the best deals, then, as you move forward as though you’re booking, it will tell you the airline before you buy. I then go to direct to the airline and get that price avoiding the Hopper fee and the restrictions that can come with it. Often the price there doesn’t include baggage meals or seats where direct to airline it does. That’s why you may see a slightly higher price in the airlines site. Buy on Hopper and you’ll still have to buy those “extras”. In short, it’s great to find the deals, but I try to go straight to the airline. If you need to make any changes or have an issue it’s far easier dealing direct.My husband and I are flying to Barcelona, and paid less than $600 each round trip. That was a Hopper find. Norwegian Airlines there and West Jet back. I would never had known to do two one way tickets without guidance from Hopper. Killer deal."
"Is there a direct number to call, a bit concerned entering my cc info on the app"
"i used the app to track the cost of flights and even set an alert on when to buy but the price kept going up without even warning me, i think it sucks!"
And what phone number works for customer service? I've been on hold for 40 min for the 18555003548 number. Same story yesterday.
Do NOT use hopper. Their customer service is non existant. If anything goes wrong with your flights (including them canceling or changing them which you have no control over) you are completely screwed.
"Beware of the $5 ""tip"" Hopper recently introduced. Instead of explicitly asking you to pay the tip, Hopper automatically includes it, doesn't fully explain it, and it's up to you to pay attention and to opt out by toggling something.I don't think it's a good business decision. You pay the fee by mistake once and will never use the app again."
"Dont book with hopper. They are dishonest, make flight changes you have no control over and customer service is non existant if you have to change anything. I wish someone had warned me."
Never again Hopper! Scammers! Check the reviews online before even thinking of using this Hopper app.
"NO!!! I was one of their victims. A friend of mine booked the same flight thru Skyscanner which is 325usd cheaper than Hopper fare. I cancelled the ticket that i booked thru Hopper within 30mins as soon as i have learned the price difference, but still they charged me for usd300 (half of the total fare) and never refunded my money back to my account. They acknowledged it and asked me to wait for 10 business days, even asked for my credit card statement to investigate why the money is not refunded yet by the airlines, they even asked me to wait for my credit card 2 billing cycles to submit to them, then in the end after more than 2months of chasing them, they denied that amount. They are thieves!!! Scammers!!! Do not trust Hopper! Read the other reviews online."
"How do I book for multiple cities? I only see return flights on the app, not multiple like on other search sites. Would appreciate your help! Thanks!"
I would like to help you by advising you to go to airline sites and not to use this app at all.
I booked flights for a family of four from USA to Italy after seeing prices I couldn't pass on - I then read reviews and was completely terrified that something would go wrong and we would end up stranded somewhere.Well - something did go wrong and a flight delay meant we would miss a connection in Portugal - Hopper and their service was EXCEPTIONAL! They answered their phones almost immediately (after reading reviews I thought they wouldn't) and worked with us to change our first flight and not miss the connection and made sure we had equivalent seats which we had paid for previously. The service was second to none!
"I was told about this app and downloaded it. Thought it was great. Booking a flight from Orlando to Honolulu. It kept telling me to wait prices would go down to around $550. At this point prices were about $690, that is a real savings so I waited. It is still telling me to wait that prices should go down to around $700. The $550 NEVER showed up! Now prices are at $930 and I am suppose to leave on July 2! Looks like I got screwed!"
"Travel 6/22/19 through 6/29/19We ponied up and purchased $1500 worth of tickets on our CC basically maxing it out for a last minute vacation. The hopper app had just shown tickets 26 minutes ago in the app. We purchased the tickets and then after hitting submit it said that American Airlines had declined our offer. Our offer? What the hell does that mean? Our offer? Anyway, it wasn't an offer.... it may have been an offer presented to us by the Hopper App... I suppose. But, I wasn't under the impression I was making an offer on anything. It said, buy now, so we bought now. Anyway, here comes all the headaches. The app promptly declines the purchase, says it's AA fault, and promises that AA hasn't charged our card. Well, they did! Right away in fact, as I got a text and email alert from my credit card company. So, I first approach Hopper to ask them why would AA decline a deal? Hopper who I just paid the recommended tip of $5 for the best customer service responds with ""Flight prices change quickly"" and said that they couldn't help. There is no phone number or online chat, to talk quickly with Hopper... you just have to randomly wait for them to respond to you. So I exchanged quite a few emails with hopper over the next day lamenting at the fact that AA has charged the card, and that the money is no being held. The money I wanted to use for air fare to our last minute destination of which I've already purchased a hotel. No such luck, hopper plainly didn't care. So, I try my luck with calling AA and to my shock and horror they relay over to me the real story. Yes, they had went ahead and charged my card because they thought I wanted the deal. Then, HOPPER the Travel Agency quickly went ahead and REVERSED the transaction and voided the ticket. I could not believe it. The AA agent on the phone told me if they had not done that I would have been on my way with a ticket. So, Hopper offer me a deal through there app, i opened up my wallet, paid nearly $1500, and behind the scenes they decided it wasn't good enough. The VERY last email to them was with this info and I never heard back from them. Meanwhile I have gone on my vacation and am now back and it's the 10th day and my money has yet to be reversed back on to my credit card. So, I just want to warn others out there... THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.... and if you were like me wanting to use credit card instead of cold hard cash.... that's what they did to me. The customer service they provided me was non existent and terrible. Nothing was resolved and I believe this company is completely unethical. I would avoid them the risk of your vacation being ruined is too much of a risk. Read the APP reviews of the guy stuck in BALI..... pathetic company."
"Question of the day if you are from Quebec province...are you protected thru the OPC...office de la protection du consommateur?? nothing on their website about this.it,s a bit like that cheap airline WOW ...comes and goes.....and you are left out of pocket. or that web engine godirect.com....who closed up 3 times!!!!go at your own risk!! why not use the services of a legit travel agency, talk to a person, and get explained your options...the web just does not give you this."
"Well I just called the OPC in Montreal and they are not registered, meaning ....Quebec clients...YOU ARE NOT PROTECTED thru OPC. and are you protected if you from Ontario ..NO.all the world of booking travel on the web, you spend hundreds of hours, then you second guess yourself, then you think you really got a deal, then you find out you have to pay all these surprise extras. You think the web gave you the best flight schedule but you can't see all your options as the airline will only sell you what is not selling and what they decide they want to give you."
NOPE. Flight prices changed without warning between glitchy searches and I went in circles trying to “sign in”. Waited over a day between so-called support emails and was offered a non-solution. Looked up other reviews - STAY AWAY. Delete it and move on if you have it.

Have you had any problems with your bookings?
"Hopper was completely useless to me when I tried to change a flight I had booked through the app. Customer service is impossible to get ahold of, and when you do, they are so inefficient it is impossible to do anything in a timely manner. I was told the fare could be changed, but every time Hopper went to change the fare, the price had increased, so they would reach out (through email) and ask if the new price was okay, I approved but the same thing happened, the fare increased... so Hopper would email again. This happened three times. Good luck trying to get in touch with anyone at Hopper by phone, it will most likely never happen. DO NOT USE this app for booking airfare."
"I absolutely love Hopper and vouch for it. Finishing my European trip today and saved money, hundreds of dollars, for multiple travelers. Easy! Predictive of best prices. Easy flight check in. I love it."
"NO, IT IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. My husband booked a flight but was unable to get any help when he was forced to cancel. Terrible customer service. They have no phone number and we found there was no one on the chat line after waiting for hours. It is better to pay a little bit more and get reliable customer service"
I had the opposite experience in a different route. Fancy that.
Customer service is zero with hopper
"well like many flight websites online...if something goes wrong....you get very little help if any. it s a roll of the dice. there are still some travel agents out there who specialize in air and have great air contracts and can even open up seats to get a better fare and better routing than the airline website. it s all about finding someone your trust who will do the research and work for you...instead of you spending hours on the web ....choices. all about choices.Edited: 12:55 pm, September 02, 2019 "
"I have never used Hopper for anything but tracking prices. I have been tracking a flight to Reno to visit my mother and today I received notification that there was a flight out of MSP to Reno (Sept 5 - Sept 10) for $211, I had already purchased a ticket on United airlines a couple of days ago but I wanted to see if I could find the same deal directly on FlyFrontier.com (considering that is what many suggest doing) to my surprise there isn't even a flight departing from MSP to Reno on the 5th of this month. Very strange and very misleading, don't think I would ever buy a flight directly from the Hopper app."
"No they Are not trustworthy. There is a glitch in their system, They cost me my tickets, over $1000 and no one cared to help me Their customer service is horrible."
Good to know thank you!
"There are lots of good response.. mostly negative ,I see ,about hopper ! I use it to track flights. I would like for you to know about ASAP tickets. My brother booked a trip to Europe for his family and had a great experience ! I just booked a trip but haven’t flown yet, to Turkey-they had a fabulous price! You will have phone calls and an active relationship with one of their agents. Would be worth checking their pricing!"
"ASAP tickets? That name rings a loud bell with me, I wonder why. Could it be because there's a thread or multiple threads about them?"
Impersonal customer service. I have used the Hopper many times with relative ease BUT this time a major issue. My flight was cancelled due to weather. I’ve not been able talk to anyone at Hopper. The responses thru email are canned responses Not quite answering questions. The airlines keep referring me to Hopper saying it’s a third party ticket. I finally received an email message from Hopper stating I’ve been issued a credit thru one of the airlines for one year and I have to pay $75 to rebook. WHAT?? I’m still trying to confirm this info with airlines. They keep referring me to “third party ticket agent”. I brought my ticket thru Hopper and would like it resolved thru Hopper. I would not use this app in the future and would advise others against it as well. I’m going to refer this matter to the Better Business Bureau.
"by ""third party agent"" I think the airline is referring to Hopper, the third party between you and them."
"Do not use hopper!! I just had the most awful experience today. I have a very important business trip I needed to get to in a Barcelona. I booked months in advance and I got to LAX today just to find out they cancelled my entire trip but not my colleagues and blamed me for cancelling my trip. I spoke with someone about changing the flight the day I booked it and ended up telling them it would be fine - they responded with ok great! So why was my trip cancelled?! They’re unresponsive! I’ve even contacted the director, Nick Young, and left him multiple voicemails. On the app they’ve even notified me of my upcoming trip three days ago!!! Not one email, not one phone call to inform me they’ve cancelled my trip."
This was a 3 yr old message but I wanted to add that we have used it twice and we’re completely satisfied. If you find a bargain you must jump on it. Lee in Denver
"I was so happy to know and app like this existed, until I finally purchased a ticket through them. I just lost $1500 due to their lack of transparency with their transactions.The ticket I bought through them, never said that I could not exchange it nor that it had ANY restrictions howsoever. The airline that I flew with told me that my ticket had all kinds of restrictions such — I can’t change my return date because we bought the cheapest option through hopper and that if we wouldn’t have use hopper, we could have exchange the dates directly with them. At no point while I was purchasing this ticket I was shown this during the check out process. We contacted hopper about this issue and they were in no way helpful. We are yet still to see the fine print or where those restrictions where listed when we purchase the tickets with them.We are taking them to court as this is completely unacceptable and unreasonable not to respond with a positive outcome but to “apologize”. I have no return ticket due to their lack of transparency. This is a company with no moral integrity."
">>>At no point while I was purchasing this ticket I was shown this during the check out process.<<<I do not expect to be shown anything. I expect to have to look for and find information on the fare ruls myself. That will often mean hovering over or clicking on something on the screen, maybe a 'q' or an 'i' in a little circle which will reveal additional information.I would be very cautious about legal action unless you are very certain indeed that the information is not to be found anywhere."
"DISGUSTING!! IF YOU WAN’T TO TRAVEL WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAS NO REGARD FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS, CHOOSE HOPPERI purchased a ticket from hopper and my flight was canceled and was placed back to be resold by both hopper and the airline. You can imagine my distress, especially because Hopper did not even notify me. It was only when I logged into check-in and the statues had changed from confirmed to canceled. I contacted hopper and all they said was “that we apologize and we are looking into it.” I was left scrambling for a flight with less than 24hrs. All flights had doubled in price. Customer service has been useless. It is extremely difficult to get a hold of. There has been absolutely no concern to ensure that my way home has been arranged. I STRONGLY suggest that you run far from this airline. Extremely unprofessional with zero concern for their customers well being, and they have ended my trip on a sour note. Shame on you."
I used hopper to book my family’s flight to Italy and I was on American Airlines from NY to Charlotte then American Airlines from Charlotte to Rome and British Airways from Rome to London and American from London to NY. When you search for flights it tells you what airline you are flying on and the total cost including taxes.
If your flight was canceled it is not hoppers responsibility call the airline to which you have a ticket for. I booked a flight though hopper and my flight was delayed and then I missed my connecting flight I booked on American Airlines through the hopper app and American Airlines took care of me. If a flight is canceled because of weather the airlines will rebook you for no charge. Next time check with the airline not hopper. Great app saved me a ton of money will use again.
"Hopper? No, I just lost $520 because of incompetent customer service. As usual everything's fine until there is a problem.I contacted Hopper’s ‘customer service’ days before the expiry of my return date to have the flight postponed and after a long 2 or 3 chats the agent promised to search and change for an alternative date. I accepted any proposed new dates, I just wanted to buy extra time and avoid losing my return. She recommended for me to close the app chat, she would send me a message when she’d get a flight.The message got to me -by email - 2 hours later and went to my junk mail. I never saw it, no message eas sent through the app. Again I had clearly explained on my email that any date would do. That email asked to choose between 2 flights, 2 days apart.The next day, I realize, I haven’t got any news, I follow up and I am informed with plenty of emojis, that I lost my return since I hadn’t replied before the flight time and the airline marked it as a no-show! Well thank you very much Hopper for not acting accordingly and allowing my ticket to be lost. Did I save any money with Hopper? Obviously not, I lost the price of a return I will now have to purchase at $520. Why? Because nobody cared my ticket would be void, no one in customer service owned my case. Good technology + lousy customer experience equals = mistrustful app."
DO NOT book with them! They charged me twice for plane tickets and there is no human you can speak too about fixing it !
"I have just recently used Hopper for flight from kentucky to scotland. I booked this flight over 6 months ago. Two weeks ago, I received an email from Hopper that the airline had changed my departure time and I had 24 hours to reschedule or accept the new flight time without cost. However, after reviewing the information on the airline, the flight time had NOT been changed. When I contacted Hopper they initially told me that I was wrong, that they had NOT contacted me about any change and that the departure time was unchanged. However, I sent a screenshot of the email that clearly indicated they indeed DID send me a new itinerary. The response was they had a glitch. I will not use this site again.Edited: 9:35 am, October 10, 2019 "
"Booked a flight through them that was cancelled by the airline a few weeks after. Tried contacting Hopper to get my money back (since I talked to the airline and they confirmed my money was refunded back to Hopper) but I could not reach them & never received my money back. I Sent them over 4 emails and even used their chat, no response at all... (& of course they dont have any customer service number you can call to...) Finally, I had to dispute the transaction w my Bank to have my money back. Do not book w them, worst experience ever!!!!"
"Hi , I am facing a similar issue and I cannot find any contact information on hopper to give them a call ."
"Hopper App is NOT trustworthy. I just booked a hotel for tonight and made for certain that the date was correct and that there was no small print disclosing hidden fees. I booked the room then received an email confirmation for the wrong date (tomorrow). I searched for tonight, was returned results for tonight, chose a room for tonight, then Hopper switched it to tomorrow. I contacted someone through the app. It took 1.5 hours for a representative to reply. They told me that they changed the date on the last screen (where I swiped to book) because no more rooms were available for tonight. This is not true. It is complete fraud. DO NOT USE THIS BOOKING SERVICE."

"Hey, what number did you use to contact them?"
"What number did you use to contact them, as there is no number listed, only a""chat"" option. They haven't replied to me yet. Smh."
"How do you get ahold of them? I cannot find a phone # that actually gets a person. US vm is full, and Canada won't answer the phone."
"In short answer, no. I booked a flight through them that originated in Philadelphia, and through a connecting flight in Toronto, would land me in Istanbul. My flight from Philadelphia to Toronto was cancelled due to weather, so after emailing them several times I had to book my own flight from New York to Istanbul the next morning. After 22 emails now, I've asked them to call me about 10-12 times and I still haven't received a phone call. They keep emailing me the same thing. That it is out of their hands because I was a ""no show"" to my flight in Toronto. How am I supposed to show up Toronto when my first flight was cancelled. The customer service is awful. Just the worst I've ever experienced. I'm reporting them to the BBB right now STAY AWAY FROM HOPPER!!!!"
Any phone to talk to a representative
"Frustrating experience with Hopper booking. I was shown the final flight amount in CAD and I used my credit card for purchase. In the confirmation email, they inform me that I will be charged in USD!!! The final price went way beyond the original amount shown in Hopper app and it was a huge disappointment dealing with their slow and unhelpful customer service :("
Is hopper prices inclusive of all charges + taxes
"Who knows? We don't know what price you're seeing or for what flights, and whether that quote includes any extras you need such as seats, checked baggage or meals. For peace of mind and clarity on what you'd be paying I'd recommend booking directly on the airline website."
See previous reply....
"No. This is the worst agency ever. I booked an international flight around a month ago and just to make sure, I called the airline to confirm the flight. First of all, hopper gave me the wrong reservation code. In the same call with the airline, I was asked if I would accept a schedule change that basically had an earlier time of arrival back to LAX. I accepted because It didn't cause any harm to my agenda. Several days after I received and email from hopper saying that “adjustments have been made by the airline” and to basically give a response confirming the knowledge of this. They didn't give an option as the airline did... i wasnt forced by them, I was asked, and if there was a “no” from me they just simply wouldn’t make any changes. I didn't bother to reply to hopper since this was a very late message by the time I already confirmed everything with the airline. I kept receiving these emails and next week I decided to reply saying that the new schedule did work for me. Yesterday night I was at the airport and turns out that my departure date was changed to a day after. I was in shock because I needed to be at my final destination by Thursday evening and not Friday. I send them an email telling them how awful was the communication to their clients and asking them to fix this problem. Im very disgusted with this not only because they tricked me but because to begin with, they didn’t give me the option to decline the changes, they just authorize that and give you the updates, and I’m pretty sure the airline will accept to keep the schedule as it originally was. Hopper says they have a 24hr help chat and it has been 6 hrs now and haven't had any response so far. Im so pissed off honestly. They sh*t on my plans."
I hope you can now understand the additional hassles that can arise by putting another party in between yourself and whoever is supplying the actual service that you're paying for.Even a good third party will be an additional layer in between the consumer and the supplier.
"Hi,today I book a flight with hopper but the code that they gave me to manage my booking in the airline page isn't working have you experience these before? Thanks!"
"Would anyone happen to have a telephone number for Hopper so I can talk to a real, live person! Thanks!"
"I'm pretty sure this app is a scam. I found a number on their policies page but when I called it the automated message said that the phone ""was not monitored"" and to contact a representative "" through the app"". I've been trying to get in touch with them for over 5 days now to cancel a flight do to an emergency. The only replies I've received are automated messages telling me someone will be with with me soon. Now I'm on hold with the airline and they can't even find my flight... I swear this can't be legal."
I actually bought a ticket for today and went to the airport they said my ticket was voided even though they took the money off my credit card. I was very lucky they were able to do something this morning. But this app is a complete scam!!!
Can you please refund my money.... it is day 11 and counting!!!Lara
"Then why is the customer service quite awful!! Chat lines consistently down, emails bounce back and phone references unavailable chat line.The company does not pay back refunds.timely.... not quite sure if they do..... still chasing my refund, 11 days after."
"I've used Hopper without any issues, but that was only until I HAD an issue. I wanted to change a flight, but when attempting to do so, had no way of doing it. First I tried their ""chat"" option on the app. Joke was on me, as there is no chat. It's always ""unavailable."" Then I tried to call using the phone number on the site. No one answered the call. I finally resorted to email and got a robo response that someone would followup up with me because they are experiencing a high volume at the moment. They robo reply said the app would alert me when someone read my request. It's been 5 days....no response. I'm fairly confident a human being is not even reading the emails. Don't book using this app unless you are POSITIVE you will not need to speak with someone to manage your booking. The airline you end up on will NOT help you as you booked through a third party."
I was disappointed to see that El Al airlines is not included in Hopper's search results.
hopper is a piece of poop. Their customer service is awful. They have no phone number to call. They only have a messaging responses and it take them from 3 to 5 days to respond. Worse costumer service in the world!
What telephone number did you use to reach a Hopper customer service agent. Same exact thing happened to me.

"Try to contact them . Customer service, physical address , phone number is not available if you will search online. If you will get into trouble then you are on your own."
"I booked 2 hotels and 1 flight in the past few months since learning of Hopper. The first hotel we arrived and they had no record of my booking. I had to pay again directly at the hotel after 25 minutes of ""texting"" customer support and getting nowhere. I requested a refund. Therefore nervous about the 2nd hotel I called and they had no record of my booking until I got transferred to the reservation department with the hotel. They were able to find me and gave me the Hotel booking confirmation # which seemed to work when calling back. I requested a refund anyway on this one too and booked something else not with Hopper. I received both refunds after a couple of days. Now onto the flight. I was able to use the confirmation number for American Airlines provided by Hopper to check on it however when I did online it was not for the flight times I booked....it was a newly added flight that is now $300 cheaper than what I paid....I got no notification of the flight change and definitely wasn't give the $300 difference back. Now it has been 48 hours since questioning them on this via the contact us option in the app. NEVER will I do this again."
"Honestly, it's hit or miss. I had watched for one-way flights from PDX (Portland) to OAK (Oakland) for over two weeks, for travel on Dec 19th. The app kept telling me to wait, as prices would continue to fall until Dec 15th. Checked it the night of Dec 11th, and it still said to wait. Now, it's the evening of Dec 12th, and the price jumped over $60 in less than a day, and won't be going back down.Needless to say, I'm pissed and extremely disappointed in Hopper for giving me such shoddy information.CONSUMER BEWARE!!"
I read your review and noticed you called Hopper? Do you have a number? I cannot find any legitimate number.
"I wish I could not even give one star! I booked a flight with Hopper and did not realize an error was made in the flight path, instead of flying from YVR to SJD it was reversed, I did not notice until a week before my flight. Of course there is no such thing as a phone at Hopper just their ridiculous chat system, which is an absolute fail. I left my post on this so called chat with ""yada yada yada ""Thank you for your patience - we will be in touch with you soon!"" NO, 3 days later still nothing! The flight leaves in a few days so I now have been forced to purchase new tickets. I bought my tickets for this trip with the error in JUNE, as you can image there are not many flights heading to Mexico for Christmas which are not full or beyond overpriced. DO NOT BUY FROM HOPPER. Customer service ya right, NO customer service!"
So you didn’t check your itinerary in June when you booked the tickets? It sounds like your error.Sadly you chose to book through an awful online ticket flogger. None of these floggers have good customer service as they have to keep cost as low as possible.It’s always wise to do due diligence checks before you hand over a load of money to a company you know nothing about. Next time book direct with the airline and check everything before booking and once you receive your itinerary. Good luck next time.
"I realise my error and I know how these companies work, it is amazing I have never had an issue with Expedia. And my point is we should get a response to correct the error. They should have at least a email address or how about something called customer service."
You go with an awful online flogger and you pay what you perceive as low prices. Why would a company like this invest in customer service? They don’t they cut overheads to a minimum.If you want customer service then book direct with the airline.It’s your word against there’s regarding the booking. Do you have screen shots to prove what you booked?
No not at all no customer service. God forbid you have to change a flight. Waited 27hrs for a response. They have no customer service phone number it's text only communication. I bought the cancellation insurance and have been getting the run around for four days to cancel my flight. I had to rebook with an actual airline pay again cause I'm now too close to departure to change flights. Garbage just Garbage zero customers service. Just wanted to change a flight wow.
"See what smudge said in the previous post to yours. If you book on the basis of a cheap price, why would you think you'd get good customer service?"
"It's nice because they help you with the timing of your ticket purchase but the customer service stinks. Don't use them! There is no phone number. I'm currently on an online chat lasting 5 hours that is worthless. Never buy the ""cancel for any reason."" My mom died and they said i couldn't get my money back because of American Airlines. I called AA and it was no problem."
"I would say No the app is not trustworthy. Let me explain. I am active duty military. So we are always flying somewhere. When I am going on vacation, I can’t use the military DTS app so I resulted to this app. Well this is what I received on my credit card statement, flight payment, 44.00 with no details, taxes and since I am St. Leadership I always, always get insurance to cancel of 39.00. Well if you look at the insurance it is only 17.00. So for a 386.00 flight, I have paid an additional 154.00. Is this really worth an extra 154.00. I don’t think so. This is one of those times that I have been directed to get Some Soldiers prepared for mobilization. This app has no way of contacting customer support. The chat doesn’t even meet the integrity agreement of contacting you back. Therefore I will be warning Soldiers of the integrity issues of the Hopper app immediately via Public Affairs for complete distribution."
"Steer clear! I got all excited about a flight I'd been watching for a while when it dropped suddenly. So I paid $20 per ticket to ""freeze"" the price. An hour later, I tried to complete the transaction but the tickets were no longer available. Hopper has not offered to reimburse me the deposit nor have they even responded by chat to my multiple inquiries. There is NO PHONE # available. Frustrated as hell."
"I use Hopper EXTENSIVELY to check airfares, but I always book through the airline. Hopper is invaluable for ""timing"" information, but seldom offers all the options for our new 'a la carte' flying experience."
"Not to bother. I got zero customer service, not even a number to call, waiting DAYS on the chat room only be told incorrect information, then waited more days with no response. This is for changing a passenger names for frustrating 14 days without success. This’s by far the worst online travel booking I ever had"
"Precisely zero customer service in my post. I wonder whether it’s legal for a online travel agency to be completely out of reach for days post sales, or not. Time to contact consumer affairs department in the state, maybe those investigative TV station reporters. I am very mad for such zero service travel agency to even exist to lure customers in."
Do not use it. I used it once and was double charged. It is one month later and I still can't get anyone to help or get a refund.
"I bought tickets to Indonesia from USA. Over $1000 for my single ticket. My other friends didn't have a date nailed down but I wanted to buy the ticket at Black Friday Prices, and since they have a Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) policy I figured it wouldn't hurt to buy them early. Turns out my friends can't join me that week. Trip has to be moved out into February. I was about to use my CFAR policy until I noticed in the fine print that Hopper says it only gives out a ""Partial"" refund. What does that mean? I tried contacting Hopper. No response. Every day for 8 days now I have reached out to them. No response! I can't afford to buy two sets of tickets to Indonesia. I might be going there by my lonely self now, and my friends are on the verge of canceling the trip entirely since we can't get tickets lined up, let alone other reservations that need to happen.I will never be using this company ever again. Hopefully by writing this review they will take notice and help me out. Then maybe I'll change my rating."
Try them again after New Year Day. Lots of places close down or have small numbers of employees on duty during the holidays.And always read the Fine Print before you book something.
I would say not trust worthy I purchase arOutline tickets for the holidays and the insurance. But when I became ill and could not travel they did not refund my money.
I have a question- how did you call Hopper? I’m trying to reach them. But the only way to contact them seems to be the online chat- where nobody has seen my message. It’s very frustrating.
Can’t only text support. Rip off
"I have used hopper a couple times, but this last time will be my last time. The airline changed my flight, big deal, that happens, but all hopper did was send me an email that said ""here's your new flight"" and the new flight was TERRIBLE! I tried replying to the email i tried contacting their ""customer support"". what ""customer support""?!?! as long as you are fortunate to have no hiccups of any kind you will not have an issue with hopper, but once you do have a problem there is nobody who can help you. The airlines won't touch your reservation if it was made through a 3rd party. so you get stuck. it is a gamble. you can use hopper to watch flight prices but DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM!"
Horrible and non existent customer service. I booked hotel and contacted them a week ago. The only way to contact is via the app and they don’t respond at all. I’m very worried as I also booked several future flights with them which I now don’t know if the airline honor since it’s looks very strange that you can’t get any response for over a week. I will definitely file a complaint to our consumer complaints state.
no they are scam!
"Snap! Great minds think alike...It's great for monitoring multiple flights over a period of time to see decreases and in some instances it sends notifications more consistently than say google flight alerts or skyscanner alerts where I am always having to check they're still active or cancel and re-do. However, their prices decreases are still not necessarily good value as the same fares can often be found cheaper elsewhere but it's a good prompt"
"I tried booking a flight yesterday. The price quoted was then raised at the time of payment. The message they displayed said that the airlines change quickly. I agreed to pay it and I got an error when paying. The trip was not confirmed yet they charged $1, then credited $1, then charged $5. I tried going on the app and look for Chat or a way to leave a message and it does not appear. I have no way to contact them to see what happened. This is not a way to make me feel like I can trust them."
"I used this app once to book flights, and would never use it again. They did NOT find the best prices, there is no way to contact them (other than a robotic chat), and the airlines will pretty much refuse to accommodate anything regarding your reservation if its made with Hopper."
"How do I get a refund on the ""Cancel For Any Reason"" that is through Hopper. The app isn't working."
"Do NOT use Hopper to book flights!!!! Use it for comparative fares, then book directly with the airline, and to check WHEN fares are low."
Thanks! What's your reason ?
"My reason? What you’re reading here. Non-existent customer support. However, the fare tracking data is valuable. If you book through the airline when you get a Hopper notice, you still save."
Does someone here know the phone number to contact Hopper´s Customer Service? I followed their travel refund instructions in the app and they have not replied for over a month!
Very worried and can’t get any help. Terrible support. I screwed up and typed my name wrong on the ticket. I immediately called the airline and because I bought it through a third party they would not help me. I have contacting hopper on the app through support for 2 weeks and have not gotten any help. I also had purchased the cancellation insurance through hopper. I don’t know how to access. Very frustrating. Anyone know what I am to do?
I am on the same boat... not even a phone number to call... I got a robot reply on the app and on an Email saying they are working on it but it has been 3 weeks.
It’s not. They just added my husband to my flight and nobody is willing to help cancel. They are just waiting for the 24 hours to pass. So disappointing!
"It’s absolutely not trustworthy!!go public everyone!! I did.Edited: 5:30 pm, January 29, 2020 "
"I would not book with Hopper. We chose flights and were booked with different flights. We paid for flight insurance. Even with the cancellation insurance we've been unable to cancel. No human is ever available, only text in the app. It states they will get back to you in a day or so and I've waited over a week. I've texted 3 times in different text streams to try to find a person. I can't find a phone number anywhere. I am now refuting the charges."
"Update on my experience with Hopper- after more than a day with mail and text, they DID help me out.They canceled the booking with my permission and will refund my money. I have to wait 3 - 6 business days. Not sure if I will book with them again though."

"Hopper has zero customer service. We are currently trying to avoid the Coronavirus by redirecting our flights home. Hopper has no customer service number, and their online app stopped replying to us as soon as the heard our situation. They’ve washed their hands of us without any kind of response. Our travel insurance will not cover tickets through a third party. Now we have to make some tough decisions..."
"No way. No customer service. Only robo response. No phone number to call. Use Google Flights for exact same fare prices. When tryed to cancel for Corona virus to Asia, said ""we will contact you."" Still no contanct after nearly a week. Keep messaging. Get exact same robo response. Seems like one person managing 1000's of bookings. Really? So many other options besides this poor service company."
"Read the 100s of horror stories. No customer service. Robo response only. Better Businesses Bureau ""bad list"" type."
"Absolutely not trustworthy. Scam in my case. I booked a Flight to Canada via America. Payed over 100€ per person extra for checked baggage. And Hopper? They booked flights in the cheapest class with a wrong return flight (2h earlier) and WITHOUT baggage or seat reservation. Unacceptable behavior that I don't get a message since over one week.The Airline told me, that I should pay 200USD per person for baggage and 200USD charge for the change.Allready called my AMEX Service for a chargeback and will do that today. I will also do a criminal complaint against this company."
"It's far more likely to be a mistake, probably through poor training and incompetence than a deliberate scam."
"We have had terrible experiences! They are impossible to get a hold of. Use another app or just book directly. This app is a great concept, the customer service is BEYOND TERRIBLE."
What is the phone number
What is the phone number?
how did you find their phone number?? I'm trying to get a hold of them the last 3 days and have had NO luck. please share!
They are NOT reputable. They cancelled one segment of my flight and I c annot get ahold of them.
They are NOT trustworthy
"I don't waste time looking for air fares anymore. I just send a text message to my Travel Agent and he finds the best fare for me when it is international. Never had any issues and very reliable. For domestic, I just book with airline.My Agent doesn't charge any extra fee and he get paid by the airline. Most of the time it is less than hopper, as I have double checked prices multiple times. So go to your trusted agent and give them your head ache and let them deal with it, rather than online web sites."
How did you get a hold of them?
"I booked two tickets to Africa for my sons for spring break; however, I booked the wrong week and want to change [since I cannot cancel, though I bought the cancellation insurance].I am now waiting for SEVEN WEEKS and have not gotten a response.These tickets were a couple of thousand dollars and British Airways says to deal with Hopper. I am so angry I could BURST. I will speak with my credit card people to see if I have a claim for a full refund.Otherwise, I will hope and pray that they get back to me in time to change the tickets."
How di you get them to respond? I have been waiting for more than 6 weeks
No. No. No. no. No.Worst experience ever. So many other better options. Cost me $$$ and lost hours and hours and hours waiting for a response that didnt answer my question
"No. Absolutely not. I originally thought Hopper was great... until I decided to use their ‘cancel for any reason’ travel insurance. I paid for the extra insurance on two flights around southeast asia due to travel concerns over the coronavirus. When I decided to cancel my trip and therefore my flights, I messaged Hopper Customer Support (which is the only way to contact them). I asked them to cancel my flights and refund me. This was almost 2 weeks ago. I have not received a refund or even a response from Hopper. The messages have not even been read yet. Their customer service is non-existent. Moreover, canceling and getting a partial refund is a service that I paid EXTRA for. This company gets you to use and pay for their services and you think you’re getting a deal, but then they scam you out of hundreds of dollars and there is not even a phone number you can call to speak to someone. NEVER use Hopper for anything more than comparing prices. It’s not good for anything more than that. Book your tickets directly through the airline."
Somebody know if hopper have a phone number?
3 months ago I booked a flight from US to Europe on Hopper. I leave in 9 days and by happenstance just found out from American Airlines that Hopper cancelled out my reservation!Hard to believe. I just sent Hopper a note (they have no phone number by which to talk to a person). App says a day before they'll respond but others here are saying they often don't answer.I might be screwed. They can get away with this?
Hi would you be able to share Hoppers customer service number? I cannot find it and I am having issues changing a flight. Thank you and sorry to hear you had a bad experience with Hopper.
Di pec... I do not believe they can be contacted via phone. You have to use the app (possibly email too)
A little Update from me:After I talked to AMEX they initalized an chargeback.Hopper didn't even reacted to American Express while they tried to contact them. Got all my money back from AMEX. Guess that is super trustworthy....not.
"Don't book through them. Use the app to compare prices, and then book directly through the airline. They have no customer service, so if anything happens and you need to change or cancel a flight, you are out of luck, even if you paid extra for their cancellation insurance."
"They don't have a phone number. You can contact their bot through the app, but you cannot talk to a person. I've heard of people getting responses through social media, although they have never responded to me."
How did you get in touch with them I don’t see a number and the app is not working when I use the support option
Reading through the thread you might have spotted the following email address:Support@hopper.com
I have a flight booked through the hopper app and have beef trying to make a change to my flight for three weeks with no response from customer service through the app. No phone number to be found online. I will not use this app again. Kayak is a better service with the same flight prices available.
What is a good customer service number for HOPPER
I just contacted Delta about the pricing I saw on Hopper and they told me to book directly with Hopper as Hopper's pricing will be a couple hundred cheaper than booking through Delta. I asked if Hopper was legit and he said yes to call them and book it.
"Hopper is horrible when it comes to customer service, ability to problem solve, response time, and clearly stated restrictions and policies. It took a day, half day, hours, etc. to get a response other than a Bott response. Then it took a day to get the answer to a time sensitive question, rendering the answer moot.I am deleting the app and returning to using Expedia and Trivago.Hopper doesn't have the proper staff and capacity to provide necessary customer service."
"Hopper may find you flights, however customer service is HORRIBLE. You get canned Bott responses. There is no way to reach a human or problem solve in a timely manner. The humans they have to address the responses are clearly overworked or just doing it part time, as their response times were a day, half day, and many hours regarding time sensitive issues. I previously used Expedia and Trivago and found them far superior to Hopper. Recently I've also joined AARP and used their call in center, which provided excellent response time and discounted comparable prices for flights and car rentals. Ex. The car rental discount was $3 per day cheaper, plus some free upgrades."
"This app is terrible! If you have problems you're just out of luck because their chat support won't respond for days and then when they do they don't answer the questions you're asking. There is no phone support so again your just out of luck! The travel insurance is worthless because when you travel with an airline if your trip is interrupted or there some problem before your return flight you can and as she ate the insurance but with hopper, from the departure of the 1st flight the insurance deactivates! I'll never use it again"
Can’t find the hopper customer service number. Can you list it?
What’s their phone number?
Same thing happened to me Jodi! CFAR Cancel For Any Reason is a scam and they know it because they bury the important details instead of being forthright.

There is none! You are stuck with their understaffed chat!!! Don't hold your breath waiting for a response because you'll be dead by the time you hear from anyone but their Bott!!
"Horrible customer service! I just need to cancel my international flight due to the virus. I don't even want any refund from Hopper. I just need the proof of cancellation so that I can use that to file a trip cancellation claim with my travel insurance. Ive sent multiple messages but only get a generic automated message back. I emailed hopper as well & got a response from 'Mariam from Hopper':""Alright, thanks for confirming!We are currently experiencing a higher volume, so wait times to speak with someone are longer than usual. I am sorry about that! For this reason, we are prioritizing cases based on the urgency of travel. Please feel free to go about your day and you will receive a notification in the app as soon as we're able to help.""I had no trouble cancelling the rest of the tour package with other companies. A surprise trip that I had planned for my hibby & kids has turned into nightmare!Never using them again unless they respond in the next 24 hours!"
"DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! they are a scam. The first time it worked fine. This time I was beat out of $250.00 by using the ""price freeze"" option that they advertise then when I booked the ticket and it was more than the price quoted they said they would refund me the difference. Never happened and they are ""conveniently"" having technical difficulties with their customer service number and say they cannot answer. There are 2 numbers with the other number stating that they can't hear you when you tell them you're -having an issue these are the numbers advertised. 855-789-0253 and 802-231-1806"
I have used hopper to fly to BC and to Hawaii and never had an issue. Currently though I bought tickets to go to Japan and Japan has offered refunds but I need Hopper to do the refund It is extremely difficult to get a hold of Hopper. Only by internet. But I have never had diffficulties with the flights and they do save you lots of money.
What phone number did you use? I cant find a phone number.
"No, total ripoff. No customer service available for emergency situations. No plan for country-wide cancellations.We booked our flight on Jan 10, 2020. Return was via Italy. Italian govt has locked down entire country.Air Canada is providing free reroutes but says you have to go through your travel agent. But it's been hours and Hopper is not responding through their app. Departure is in less than 24 hours.Never again booking a flight through Hopper. First and last time."
"This is the worst travel experience I have ever had. I booked a flight with you months ago confirmation number RXMFEN and through all this time it read confirmed. The flight was today and the airline company still could not find our reservation. I had to spend double the on purchasing tickets at the airport because the purchase I made through Hopper was FRAUD! I need Hopper to reimbursement my entire purchase. Hopper is stealing money claiming to sell flight tickets and it's fake! I tried contacting Hopper since last week and no one replied. I need my money refunded! $1,685.84"
Speak to your credit card provider about doing a chargeback.
"Why do people believe there is a free lunch? If they are charging lower prices as an intermediary, THERE IS A REASON!!! Or is that too tough a concept to grasp?"
"Often, the prices aren't even cheaper. Cecelia, you are not speaking with Hopper here. Next time, you should probably check your reservation directly on the airline's webpage."
I have not yet encountered a fare on Hopper that I could not duplicate on the airlines’ own websites. Why book through Hopper ever? Use them as a “who’s offering what fares” database. Full stop.
"booked a flight with cancel for any reason insurance. Had to change the dates so attempted to cancel. they changed the refund policy after i purchased the ticket and it Took a week for the company to respond. I actually had to reach out to them on twitter its pathetic. I bought the CFAR plan and Hopper only offered me a refund for $150CAD less than i paid. absolutely pathetic customer service. You have to reach out on twitter before they will respond in the app, and you cant call hopper. Hopper does not have a phone number at all."
"I WILL NEVER USE HOPPER AGAIN. Booked comparatively cheap fares weeks ago for spring break in Mexico, San Antonio to Cancún. Was a combination of two one way fares, one on United going, Interjet coming back, seemed to be the best combination of prices and times. The res code for interjet never worked which I identified even before I took the trip. The only way you can contact Hopper is via an app which I did, No phone. No email. Only a chat. Did this days before I left and multiple times through my trip. All I wanted to do was to be able to check in online etc. Never any response and this is when Coronavirus was starting to happen. Hopper is just an aggregator of fares with little to no responsibility for what happens outside the app. Pay more and stick with Orbitz or other or book w airlines. Then you can get somebody on the phone who might actually have some obligation to help you. And while I am on the topic never could get Interjet on the phone and their app seems to suck. I am dine with non US based carriers unless it is completely unavoidable. And after this burn I will not book separate one way fares on different carriers. Just more to go wrong."
"Okay, ONE MORE TIME. Last year I “discovered “ the airfares for my UK trip on Hopper. It told me of obscenely low fares on TAP Portugal Airlines headed East, and Norwegian Airlines headed west. I BOOKED DIRECTLY ON THE TAP AND NORWEGIAN WEBSITES, and got the very same fares reported on Hopper. I will do it again this year. Use Hopper as an information source ONLY. Their customer service bites. Don’t be so childlike in your attitude about cheap fares. They’re all the same as from the airlines."
Not at all a scam with no customer service
"NOT TRUSTWORTHY!1 Tried contacting them to change return flight for student studying abroad who was recalled due to Covid-19. NO PHONE NUMBER AVAILABLE! Only response was thru a bot. Their help desk shows on their website to contact the airline. Will not work. I will contact my legal representative this week to discuss the possibility of filing a class action lawsuit against Hopper.As an aside, the student purchased the ticket before I had an opportunity to become involved in it.Suggestion: make other arrangements to purchase any plane tickets either directly from the carrier or from a more reputable agency. If there is no way to contact them other than via bot, you could possibly lose money.Our resolution: we had to purchase a new one-way ticket with another carrier in order to exit before the new travel ban becomes effective Monday 16 March 2020.Hopper provided absolutely NO assistance in resolving this matter."
"I had some bad experiences. The main issue is you can't deal directly with the airline if there are changes needed. This was annoying once before when a connecting flight was canceled, but downright anxiety producing during the coronavirus pandemic. On March 12, I tried to cancel a booking 48 hours before my first flight. It didn't get a response for over a week (March 20, so even my returning flights on the 19/20 didn't get cancelled), at which point, Hopper told me it was too late for a refund or credit. They don't have a phone number so for that period of time, I just had to wait the 8 days for them to respond to my messages. Very frustrating. I will never book through them again."
"""The main issue is you can't deal directly with the airline if there are changes needed.""---That's generally the case when you book with any third party."
"Hopper will tell you a flight is Economy when it is actually Basic, after you filter out all Basic Fares. Not until you check your booking with the airlines do you see what you are actually getting. I filed a cancelation early this week as my airlines is allowing them due to CV, lets see how smoothly that works..."
"Okay, some weeks after I made the chargeback this scam company changed my flight (they canceled 3 Flights and changed 1 to checked baggage) they now forced AMEX to chargeback the money from me...So now they want the money and give me totally NO FLIGHT.100% Scam, made a complaint today and hope for the courts.."
Hopper is unreliable. I paid extra to be able to cancel flights for any reason and when I cancelled the trip they didn't process it and they didn't give me a refund. I dont recommend using hopper
"Did you get any resolution? I booked a flight for June, and now, I can't talk t anyone"
"I cannot believe the horrible customer service provided by Hopper. I could not travel with these travel bans and the airlines were offering free rescheduling, but yet Hopper will not answer my multiple attempts at contact for the past 2 weeks. All that answers is the stupid bot and its some generic canned response about how they are overwhelmed with people contacting them. Well No Duh! My flight has left without me on it because of your unprofessionalism in running of a business. So basically Hopper has stolen my money."
what number did you call bc i can’t find one
"Please never use this app. I try to get some information for almost 3 weeks. No help, no customer serive, no contact."
"Hopper is Fraud never book a ticket through them...I have booked my ticket through Hopper with British Airways and paid for all types of insurance too and my flight was on March 14, 2020, from USA to Turkey and return on March 31, 2020, from Turkey to USA, however, due to COVID-19 President Trump banned all Travels from USA to Europe and vice versa on March 11, 2020 so I have messaged Hopper since this fraud company has no direct number, I contacted British Airways couldn't reach anyone for days till to date. I don't know how to sue them they have my money more than 3 weeks now. Today I rechecked Hopper messenger they removed all my flight info and messages They are fraud never buy ticket from them and the government should find out where they are located and they should be jailed by stealing people money during this pandemic and unemployment."
Not if anything goes wrong. The worst customer experience of my life
"Don’t use Hopper, go directly to the airline. Hopper is a scam and yes you will have endless grief."
Don’t trust Hopper. I booked a flight with a cancel forward any reason option and got stiffed for over $1000.00. There is no way to contact them and they have quit responding to my emails.
Well they don’t sound too amazing to me. I had them scam me out of hundreds of dollars. Their price lock s not really a price lock as they advertise . They tell you after you purchase the fare that you would only get $100 refunded if the fare goes up yet when you book it they tell you you will get the full difference. It really is a scam and a bait and switch
Vased on myPersonal experience DO NOT USE HOPPER. My flights were cancelled do to the worlds situation and although I purchased travel insurance hopper will not refund my money. They gave me no choice and choose to issue me travel credit that I mostly will never get to use because the length of usable time isn’t enough. However I would like to have my money refunded in the same way in which I paid. I have tried to contact them several times about this issue with no reply from them. Hopper has now blocked me from contacting them.
"Hopper is absolutely horrible. If you want to use it to look at the way the prices of flights will change that is okay. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT book through the Hopper application. I have booked through the Hopper application twice and have been screwed both times. The first time I was charged additional fees for checked bags that I should not have been charged for. When I booked through the application I was told I would be allowed one FREE checked bag per individual travelling. My fiancee and I each had to pay for our own checked bags when we arrived at the airport. So (1) they provide misinformation when you book. The second time I booked with them I was told I would be allowed two FREE checked bags on my international flight. Once again I arrived at the airport and I was charge $200 for my second checked bag which was supposed to be free. This was on my recent trip to Greece. Unfortunately I happen to be in Greece when the travelling restriction was placed. I tried to contact Hopper's customer service team, but nothing. They clearly state that they are trying to tend to individuals with immediate emergencies first, but if it had not been for my daughter I would still be stuck in Greece. The airline I was flying with (United Arab Emirates) ended up cancelling my return trip home on Thursday March 12th. On this same day I logged on online and pair extra for my seat selection. They took the money from my credit card even though my flight had already been cancelled. My daughter decided to do some research and call the airline. She spent two hours on the phone to find out my flight had been cancelled. I had not received any communication from Hopper or United Arab Emirates that my flight had been cancelled. She scrambled and spent about 4 hours trying to find a flight for me to be able to come home on Friday March 13th because after that Friday travel restrictions were becoming severe. She paid $2500 to get me home on that Friday. I have been in communication with Hopper customer service through the app since Saturday March 14th. I keep getting the same message. One of the Customer Service pages on the Hopper website stated that any additional charges incurred due to issues would be covered. I was told numerous times that my refund request has been submitted with the airline. In addition I received a very rude and non-informative email from the United Arab Emirates Airline. I have not received any response from the Hopper customer service team on the application for two weeks now and it seems like the messages I send do not even go through or are even seen because they are from an ""old"" chat. Totally crazy. So I have spent approximately $600 for my round-trip flight, an additional $200 for the checked bag that was supposed to be free, $27 for selecting a seat on a flight that was already cancelled, and $2500 to come back home being that Hopper was so helpful in assisting ""those in immediate emergency situations"". PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE heed my advice and do not use the Hopper application to book flights and/or hotels. If something happens, you will be royally screwed."
"Fool me once, shame on you . . . . Tell your friends on Facebook and elsewhere, Anna. We have 600+ posts here telling us they are terrible. Your post isn't informing anyone new."
"It's sadly true that almost all of the people who see your post will already be well aware of the message, Anna.N_T is right that using social media to tell your friends and family will be a more effective thing to do, but even then I don't think it will make a huge difference.Maybe if a few million do it, we might see a difference, though."
Do not use hopper! We booked through them and covid-19 shut down happened: they refused to refund the reservation even though flights and hotels were closed
"So..try to find a phone# for customer service for Hopper. Nothing on their app. Googled them , they are based in Montreal and have a Boston office. Called phone number and its not Hopper on the other end. So no accurate # found.The app has directed me to Iberia airlines to deal with COVID issues. Iberia initially said deal with Hopper...then on subsequent call Iberia told me that TravelFusion in the UK is the ""holder of my tickets"" and only they could refund me...Iberia will only give me voucher for future trip (with time constraints). TravelFusion (only available by email) replied ""contact Iberia for voucher or full refund.""I had bought trip/flight insurance at same time from Hopper. Aon refuses to cover as a ""claim"" and appearantly is underwritten by Nationwide Ins. Finally when I asked to be refunded insurance expense or at least a credit for future flight I was denied- so they took $ for insurance on a trip- that by no fault of mine - never occured!!I have issues with the poor response of all of these involved companies... but be AWARE- HOPPER sells ""services"" from sketchy companies..Not only do they lack transparency...the associated companies and even their own customer service appear to be undiscoverable. I WILL NEVER USE HOPPER AGAIN"
"yes, Terea, that's why this thread is 4 years old,Don't tell us, we already know. Tell your friends. Post on Facebook. Tweet about it. Tell the people who also don't research before they jump at a ""cheap fare"" like you did."
"The problem is hopper says their cancellation anytime will be refunded, and they didn’t honor that. If they’re not going to honor it, don’t say cancel anytime. Done."
"Please post any updates if a class action is started, I have had the same trouble!"
"The only way I got a reply was by 1) starting a ""Charge Dispute"" with my CC (VISA) and 2) by sending them a DM on Twitter. THEN is when suddenly I was contacted. Prior to that it was crickets."
"Hey! So I saw your question about HopperI have used Hopper SO MANY TIMES and I have never had an issue. I have used it for domestic and international travel. It's one of my main travel apps I use. I have never had an issue however I like to use it to find my fares and then I will usually go to the direct site of whatever airline it is offering and see if booking directly gives me the same price (if so, book direct) . The only way you will get treated differently at the airport by using hopper is if you do not chose your seats. When you book 3rd party the airline does know and you seat choice isn't always the best. Best sometimes for the fare.... it doesn't even matter. I have flown to Hawaii for 500 RT from the Midwest, Greece, Germany, Mexico, etc. 10/10 would recommend."
Hi. What email address did you use for them. I can’t find one
Have you ever had to request a refund because the airline cancelled your flight and you purchased the flight protection cancel for any reason insurance from hopper?
"Please stay away, I've had a bitter experience. While the app gives some info which is helpful. DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM. There are no live personnel who'd respond incase you run into problems. The replies in the app are automated responses."
"I couldn’t agree more - do not use Hopper! I will never use again. I’ve been trying to cancel for flights and have spent months trying to do it. I have sent multiple cancellation requests and filled out the Hopper cancellation form multiple times. No one responds. Their communication is awful. And it’s impossible to reach a human being. When you use the Hopper app, it takes you in circles. But when I call the airlines, they say that I need to cancel through Hopper since I booked through Hopper. Never again."
The airlines are right.And this thread has been warning folks for 4+ years. Did you do any research before you gave them your money?
"READ THIS FIRST BEFORE BOOKING WITH HOPPER!!!! They are not trustworthy!!! I repeat, not trustworthy!!! No phone to contact a representative! No replies to email!! No way of online chatting with them. They misconnected my flights just to hold tickets on flights. I have lost $691.80 after buying REFUNDABLE tickets. They include in the price of the ticket a tip to them. It is NOT worth the frustration and loss of money!!!"
"@Northern_Traveler00 - Several friends had recommended Hopper (before the pandemic). Thanks for the lack of empathy for other travelers.Edited: 9:14 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"Your friends got lucky, HS. I hope you have told them to stop recommending Hopper, as well as telling the rest of your friends,Edited: 6:08 am, May 25, 2020 "
"Hopper is not trustworthy. They are a third party and their cancel anytime insurance is a fraud. Additionally the AON insurance I purchased did not honor their contract to pay for the canceled flights due to covid-19. Instead these travel companies are using covid-19 as a reason and way to rip off customers - just go to the airline company instead. Do not use hopper, they are a scam and fraud. If you're searching for their customer service and cannot find it, it is because it is not listed anywhere and only in their app is there is a robot chat. Do not use hopper. They are a scam."
"I am a teacher who has limited funds, but loves to travel.I have been using hopper for a few years now and always recommended it to my fellow travelers for finding cheap flights. I had never needed to contact them before this pandemic. I have had two of my trips cancelled by the airlines. Both times I was told by the airline that my refund was given to hopper because I booked with them. I have repeatedly tried to contact hopper. There is no phone number, no customer support email contact. Just a make believe robo chat, and ZERO actual customer support. After 2 days of searching for how to apply for a refund I finally found a form that I was able to fill out and submit...I still have not heard back. For the next cancelled flight, I received an email from hopper telling me my flight was cancelled by the airline with the directive: ""If you have questions about an airline schedule change, feel free to contact our support team for assistance by tapping ""Other requests"" directly from your trip in the app!"" Funny, because when you click on this ""other requests"" button (which is the only button available to press) it takes you to meaningless articles that put you around and around in a loop of nonsense. The cancellation request form that I filled out for the previous cancelled flight is now nowhere to be found on their app or website. Unfortunately I have a third flight coming up that will most likely be cancelled as well. I will NEVER use this app again. I will be posting this review on every single travel forum I can find and will be taking legal action. Hopper: If you would like to fix this issue, which I sincerely hope that you do, please contact me. I understand that you are overwhelmed, but It doesn't seem like you actually want to help, just steal hard working peoples money. I TRULY thought you were a great company. You should be ashamed!!! So disappointed."
"Jennifer; I'm sorry this happened to you.I hope you teach your students to do research before they make purchases.This thread is 4 years old for a reason, with over 500 posts.Please TELL YOUR FRIENDS and your students not to book through online agenciesAnd don't take ""legal action"". File a dispute with your credit card company"
"Many of us have had the exact same experience with Hopper, Jennifer. I had never even used it until about 2 months before the pandemic. Like you, I also used it based on a few friends’ recommendations. I have a total of 4 flight reservations for myself and family members which need to be canceled and I have absolutely no idea whether I’m going to get any kind of credit or refund from the airlines. The airlines will not deal with us directly since we booked through Hopper. But it’s impossible to reach a human being at Hopper nor receive any kind of confirmation that our cancellation requests are being processed.I think we should ALL file complaints with the BBB and other consumer protection agencies. Maybe that will get their attention. I’ve also disputed the charges with my credit card company.Edited: 6:21 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"H S 2 things 1 - Hopper should only be used as the tool it is, find out every airline that flies from point a to b so you know your options, then buy the ticket from the airline if the hopper app has a cheaper price, still book with the airline, problem solved....however....the BBB is not a consumer protection agency, they have about as much legal authority as a college dorm RA, the one thing they can do is ""grade"" businesses. Google reviews, yelp, and general internet forums like this have made the BBB totally obsolete and filing a complaint with them will just make someone feel good that you remember they exist. That all being said, you went bargain hunting and you found a cheap ticket, you got it through a cellphone app and the airline told you that its not their problem, that does not justify you filing a consumer complaint against anyone except take it as a learning opportunity and book directly next time"

"Just Another Hopper Horror StoryI flew to Europe before the lockdown. Air New Zealand LAX-LHR-VIE no problem. On the return Austrian wasn’t flying so I couldn’t get to LHR. I used the app to contact Hopper 10 days before the flight to try to change it. No response. The day before the flight I called Air New Zealand and they changed my booking out of VIE on Austrian and put me on a Virgin flight to LAX. Eventually that was cancelled also. Air New Zealand said to ask for a refund from Hopper. Hopper says because Air New Zealand changed my flight they, Hopper, wouldn’t process the refund. Air New Zealand tells me they have already paid Hopper back and that I should get the refund from Hopper. So Hopper is using the excuse that because they didn’t respond to my change request but the airline did, somehow that absolves them of any obligation to refund.Most likely Hopper won’t survive the lockdown so there won’t be any money for refunds in any case. Good riddance."
"Hopper App……… better off walking to your destination…….it is the worst travel app I have ever used and their customer service is useless and a ZERO response rating. NO phone and NO email!!! They deserve NO STARS as a review rating but I had to give 1 Star to be able to leave this review…….Customer Service is through a supposed chat messaging system in the app which they never respond to. Here is my situation – ongoing with Hopper…….. I used them per a friend’s recommendation…..needless to say my “friend” will not be getting a Christmas card this year…. all jokes aside…. I used them to purchase (2) RT airline tickets first week of February AND I bought and paid for their “CANCEL FOR ANY REASON” Travel insurance. As everyone knows COVID wiped out travel in February and March and my travel plans and subsequently my trip was canceled. This happened shortly after I made my reservations in February and I have been trying every which way I could find to contact them and discuss my refund etc etc. In 4 months, it is now June 11, 2020, I have attempted to contact them and resolve this issue, mostly through the app messaging support system. I look at all my messages sent to them regarding this fiasco and they all read…..message NOT READ, with exception to a few that sent me a generic message, due to covid etc etc we are extremely busy blah blah but then never responded to any subsequent messages after. I must have sent them 30-40 messages in attempt to get some help. Nothing but CRICKETS. Meanwhile I am out well over 600 dollars since February, including the cost of that aforementioned insurance. So after all these MONTHS of no answers to my pleas for help, I receive an email from them -TONIGHT June 11, 2020, from a NO-REPLY email address of course…… now mind you this is my account, my credit card and my email……however this email is written and directed to someone else through my email and purchase confirmation number and it states as follows…… Hi *******, (NOT MY NAME)We are reaching out to you regarding the cancellation request for your Hopper booking ******. When processing your request, we noticed that after submitting your cancellation request, you have since re-booked your travel for A FUTURE TRIP. Because you have re-booked, we will not be processing a cancellation request for your booking and your request has been removed from the cancellation request queue………. Are these people absolutely MENTAL??? I have booked no travel of any sort since February which was this cancellation. Where are they getting this information??? This is the most absurd travel or attempted travel setup experience I have ever had, and I travel a lot. So to top off the email…….. They thanked me for my patience during this “challenging time” and feel free to contact us if I have any further questions. WHAT THE………..? I double checked all my attempted contacts in the app to Support to see if by some miracle they responded LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD in the app and nothing changed just a ton of messages UNREAD……but hey they had time to update their website and make it nice and pretty, since I last looked a month ago……..Hopper is sadly pathetic and I am even more sad over my 600++ dollars due to these people and their scam. My advice……. DO NOT USE HOPPER, TERRIBLE operation, TERRIBLE service, TERRIBLE EVERYTHING…… I sincerely hope Kharma nails them and they close up shop…. Maybe they can take my 600++ dollars and go to a nice steak house, since they are apparently a bunch of scammers and thieves. I know this was a lengthy review but I am truly pissed off and frustrated and HOPPER…..you deserve ZERO stars in every category…. Thank you for taking my money and providing me with NO SERVICE OR ASSISTANCE!!!!"
"Can't read all that but three suggestions for you:1) file a claim with your credit card company2) never buy insurance from the company selling you a product or service. They will always make sure that it is next to impossible to collect, and if they go out of business you are out of luck3) always research companies independently before you give your money to strangers. This thread is four years old and 500+ posts for a reason"
"After my the initial email from them saying I was no longer eligible for a refund (because the airline changed my reservation and that was because Hopper did not respond and the flight was imminent) I responded to Hopper. I think I'm lucky because I was eventually contacted by an actual person at Hopper via email. That person appears to be professional and interested in helping. I'm going to reserve final judgement until this is resolved--likely months into the future. I'm still not convinced Hopper will survive, but I'm hoping for the best. In summary, if you are contacted via email by a real person, they seem to want to try to do their job and provide service."
"Hopper is absolutely NOT trustworthy.They lure you with a feature called ""price freeze"" and then promise a refund if you book through them.I used them recently to watch flights during Covid-19, and found one decently priced offer from one West Coast city to another. I usually drive this scenic route, but figured for less than $150, I'll fly this time. I used the price freeze function, which cost $35. I secured PTO and tried booking within the week they allow for the price freeze, but the booking function did not work. There was a note ""Oh shoot! Something went wrong - There was a technical error while processing your booking. Not to worry - you can visit our Help Center for more information or contact our Support Team directly."" Then a blue button, Contact Support. I did that first; who has time to read through all the Help topics? Clearly, this was something that went wrong on the app. I left several questions in the support window, but no-one responded. I waited a few hours, tried booking again, tried leaving messages to support, and my previous message still was ""not seen"". I made about twelve booking attempts, left seven or eight support messages and a lengthy description of all the steps I had taken, but even after 18 hours, no one had responded, no one had seen it. I went through the help topics regarding price freeze troubleshooting. They suggested creating a new flight watch for the same date and destination, but all flights were either much longer with at least one stop, or a lot more expensive. The trouble with Hopper is, they don't respond to you unless you write a bad review. A developer response did not shed any light on the situation, but offered to ""investigate"". I then emailed them, and a Pamela (aka a Karen) responded telling me this situation was not Hopper's fault but the airlines; due to Covid-19, airlines had increasingly canceled flights. This was a lie; I had checked with Alaska Airlines, and they never canceled the flight; they just sold out and the only ticket left was a first class ticket. Pamela also claimed she had not seen the support requests in the app chat function; it follows the app is even faultier than it appears. They are scammers, and the reviews in the App Store support this. I was not offered a refund but was told I could book my next flight through Hopper and use the $35 then. Needless to say I have no desire to keep this app, and I certainly don't trust them - so why would I book a flight through them?So stay away. Google offers flight tracking, which I was using before this. You're better off booking directly with the airlines anyway."
"I absolutely DO NOT recommend Hopper. They may be a little less expensive, but it's NOT WORTH IT.We had to cancel our flight because our cruise was cancelled (due to covid). Apparently, Hopper thought we should still have flown to NEW YORK CITY at the height of the pandemic. They have REFUSED to refund our money -- and gave us a 'voucher for future travel' instead -- which must be used within one year.NOT FREAKIN' ACCEPTABLE. WE aren't responsible for the cancellations."
"wiersma:Had you waited for your flight to be canceled you likely would have been refunded your money. By canceling your ticket voluntarily you gave up so many of your rights.Going thru a third party like Hopper, or Priceline, or TravelGenio puts you in a precarious position right from the start. You are no longer the customer of the airline, but you are the customer of some internet company somewhere.This is not a good company. This thread has 4 years of complaints. Did you do any research before you chose to give them your money? Even in normal times they are a company to avoid. But since you chose to cancel your tickets you are likely out of luck. Truth be told, you likely shouldn't have even gotten a voucher.Book direct with the airline in the future.Do research in the futureAsk someone if you should cancel or wait in the future instead of just jumping in and canceling."
We booked through Hopper because my daughter used them a LOT last year when she spent a semester in Spain. She and her friends traveled all over Europe -- cheaply!But I understand exactly what you're saying. And I won't take a chance like this again. The worst part is I had booked 5 tickets -- so the loss is well over $1000. Live & learn...
Hope you saved enough using them over the years to cover these losses
NO!!! Hopper refuses to refund my money on a cancelled trip to California during the Covid 19 travel restrictions. Be advised if you live in the USA legal recourse is difficult as they are based in Canada
Update on the class action suit??
"There won’t be any, Jackie. And if there is, the lawyers will get most of the money, like usual."
Do not use this app. A few days before the airports were closed in Europe due to Covid 19 my son who was studying overseas was desperate to get home the flight that he reserved on hopper was canceled this was a desperate situation because we had enough money for one flight He he managed to get home but to this date which is June 30th we have not received any money back from hopper I'm hoping that somebody will file a class lawsuit against them
"No lawsuit is going to help you, Lori. Only lawyers make money there.Dispute the charge on your credit card and learn to book direct."
"What is their number? I had same problem and I can’t find their contact info anywhere, just a chat and they aren’t answering. please help"
How did you contact their support services? Do you have a phone number?
"No Number. Bad company  Posts here warning you away for many years. Read the thread for advice. Not many options, but a couple"
"I am a frequent traveler, and until recently, I loved Hopper and recommended it to many of my friends. Now, I will NEVER book through Hopper again.Back in February 2020, I purchased a ticket from JFK to Capetown, South Africa for travel in April 2020. I also paid an additional $83 for their ""Cancel for Any Reason"" plan. (The name of this has since been changed to ""Refundable Ticket Plan."") Due to both work circumstances and COVID-19, I cancelled my flight in March. I expected a prompt refund, which was the entire reason I purchased the ""Cancel for Any Reason"" plan. However, I received an email stating that I could expect a decision to be made within 90 days. I completely understand the extenuating circumstances because of the pandemic BUT the title of the ""Cancel for Any Reason"" policy is VERY misleading. Apparently, the terms and conditions were changed after I purchased - a pandemic exclusion was added meaning that I may not actually received a refund at all.Furthermore, it has now been MORE THAN 90 DAYS. I have been trying fruitlessly to contact Hopper through the app and via email without a response. Despite an email that I received boasting about the ""new and improved 24/7 live chat customer support,"" no such thing exists - there is only a bot. I have searched endlessly for a customer support number without success.I am EXTREMELY disappointed and frustrated with Hopper."
"TNP: That really stinks. All of the online agencies are having trouble coming up with refunds. They all have thousands and thousands of cancellations with no money coming in. That being said, you are owed your money back.Have you tried a credit card chargeback?"
"@Northern_Traveler00 Thanks. I plan on contacting my credit card company later today, as as several people have suggested that. I'm afraid it might be too late though - my understanding is that legally I have 90 days to dispute a charge."
"Hopper is a scam. I booked a hotel reservation through them. After COVID hit I cancelled the reservation and the hotel manager contacted Expedia who owns Hopper and told them to give me a full refund. Expedia said they told Hopper to process the refund and I only received half of the refund. I have in writing from the hotel manager that I am to receive a full refund. Hopper does not have a customer service number and they have since deleted my reservation on their app so I cannot contact customer support through the app. I have setup a dispute on my credit card but have had to appeal since Hopper replied that the charge was valid but did not reply to the hotel's cancellation. My next step will be to take them to small claim's court as they have violated their contract with me and the hotel. Basically they have stolen the money from the hotel by not issuing a refund and by not paying the hotel. My advice to anyone who is not receiving a refund is to setup a credit card dispute, if that does not work take them to court."
"Hopper steals from consumers! A $76 ""price freeze"" fee just magical appears on my account they are failing to respond or refund. NEVER use them. I am filing fraud with my credit card company!https://www.facebook.com/*******87821/posts/*******450837/?d=n"
"lets start a lawsuit against them!!! they have messed me out of $2,000!!!"
"Good luck with that, colita. Have you tried a chargeback with your credit card company?"
Hooper is a fat scam they did not refund my covio19 losttrip. There’s no number to call. SCAM
"Have you contacted your card provider about this, Jun Le Reign?"
Complete scam that is using the pandemic as an excuse to hold your money that airlines have refunded for cancelled flights. There is zero customer service and no phone numbers. They do not monitor the chat rooms in the app and only send bot responses. I received an email from Hopper on 6/1/20 (from a cancellation request made on 3/27/20) saying the airline approved a full refund and that it could take up to 6 weeks to post. It’s been 9 weeks and not a word from Hopper. This is for flights in May to Hawaii that were cancelled by the airline. There is absolutely no reason I shouldn’t have my full refund by now. My husband is an attorney and is in the process of pursuing legal action. NEVER use this 3rd party app EVER. Hopper - refund my booking now or be prepared to have legal action taken against your scam.
Did you overlook four years of complaints here when you booked with them?
"Booked my flight but Cathay cancelled flight. Hopper useless to help as requested by airline, chat doesn't work, email doesn't work, phone rings three times and disconnects. Tried a hundred times. Totally useless. You must beg the airline for help!!Don't risk money with Hopper!"
"Didn't search for reviews. Really stupid of me but the airline is making it work!!! Never ask for refund, take a voucher!!!"
I booked a flight on Hopper on 2/29 for an event. The even was cancelled due to Covid. I cancelled my tickets on 3/18. I received a reply to be patient due to Covid and it might take up to 90 days. It has been over 4 months and all I get is the standard reply even though I have repeatedly asked when I should expect my refund. The frustration is not worth the small amount that I saved using this app. It was my first time to use the app and will not use again
"Don't do it with Hopper. If your flight is delayed or cancelled, your money is history!!! Go directly to the airline, third parties are now hopeless!!"
"If you cancelled the flight, Shawna, you may not be able to get a refund. If the airline canceled it then you might have a refund due"
Horrible
"They owe me $1200. I will never see it until some attorneys decide to do a class action. That should be soonThey are horrible. Dishonest. They don't care. The Hopper President had but a simple response to the Pandemic; he closed down email services, shutdown telephone lines and laid off customer service reps. He saved money at our expense. SHAME ON HOPPER"
"until some attorneys decide to do a class actionNot gonna do it on their own Burl, are they? If you're that sure that Hopper has broken the law (which is highly unlikely), then get on with it yourself. Alternatively, you'll continue to sound like a snivelling cheapskate.Edited: 2:07 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Yes, good prices but no service. If your flight is changed or cancelled by the airline, you are screwed! Hopper will keep your refund !!!!!!!!!Their phone doesn't work, chat doesn't work, email doesn't work.Look elsewhere. ""F"" rating with BBB"
"""F"" rating with BBBThat should finish them off. The mortal blow."
"What was their rating when you booked, Rweinc?"
"Hi, I’m going through the same situation where I’m canceling my booking and going to book directly with the airline company. All the reviews I’m currently reading about their refund, makes me feel like I’m going to end up not getting my money back. How did you contact them? There’s no working phone number for this company."
It takes weeks to get issues resolved. You can never talk to a person just through Chatbots. I had an issue where I tried to book a flight through hopper gave them my credit card info etc and then when I hit book it said that flight was sold out and error. I went to Airfrances site and booked directly for that same flight at a cheaper price. Hours later Hopper sends me an email saying flight booked and charged me. I have been trying for weeks to get my money back on their double booking and no one responds and I can’t speak with a person. So caution in working with this company.
