Trust me; that post won't be around long...:)Truth Hurts.
"No where in that article does it say that Obredor is thinking of banning Americas from coming. And even if it did, consider the souce. (Not you Gene, the DailyMail). Hardly a publication with a reputation for publishing only the facts. E and I watch at least part of Obredor's daily press conference just about every morning. NEVER has he even come close to suggesting he might close the norder. Just the opposite, in fact. He's routinely said Mexico will not close their borders. Agree or disagree with how Mexico is handling this situation. That's your prerogative. But at least rely on accurate info when doing so and not some publication best known for sensationalism."
Like tourism?
"The post with truth will remain here, others such as these will likely be deleted."
"Well, I hope you are right ... it sounds like a stretch to me, as well.Not implausible, however.Sheesh ... these days, everything is up for grabs.Edited: 7:07 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"From Noticaribehttps://noticaribe.com.mx/2020/03/13/coronav…Since tourism is evaporating rapidly anyway at least for the near furure whether there is a restriction or not, might as well have the restriction and protect the public health. It's unfortunate but necessary. If the USA had much stricter restrictions on foreign arrivals a month ago when there were 60 cases instead of now with thousands and multiplying we wouldnt have tilhis problem. It's basic epidemiologyEdited: 7:15 pm, March 13, 2020 "
PS. Obrador is the president's maternal last name and is not customarily used on it's own in Spanish. That's like calling you Ms.____ (and using your mother's maiden name.)
"I know. But when I referred to him as AMLO no one knew who I was talking about, lol. People asked if I meant Obredor. I said this in a thread on the Cancun Forum where you posted your source but I'll say it here as well. Thanks for posting it. I don't (and will never) put any stock in what the Daily Mail reports but do trust your source. Thanks again."
"Worldtraveler way to blame Trump for something that has absolutely nada to do with him. Anywhoo, I did consider the source, but other news sources are reporting similar stories, so it would not surprise me if it were true. And I was mistaken, it says the minister of health, not the Mexican president.Edited: 7:47 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Reuters is pretty reputable, and they are reporting a similar story, we were so looking forward to this trip, but health is more important.https:/…"

·I don't believe this at all! Americans make up for over half of the traveling that goes to Cancun and Mexico. The amount of money Cancun and Mexico would lose would collapse the entire Mexico and Cancun economy beyond repair.
"If Amlo or whoever wants to bar Americana, it must include Canada as well, as they will be playing political and financial suicide with the new trade agreement. This will not happen. Just mis information."
"World Traveler, keep your politics out of it AND TO YOURSELF!!!!.... Lay off CNN, GEEZ. Try Fox for real news.PS, Fredo is an Idiot"
"Fearless comin in hot for his first post, and I have to agree with every word!"
"Actually, I've posted a lot over the years. For some reason, TA has given me a new name or something.. I'm a huge fans of your too! lolI go under Atripforalifetime"
I think I corrected it..
"Well the governor of Ohio (a republican) was just on Fox (Trump TV), and said they estimate there are 100,000 people in Ohio infected. If this is the case, Mexico needs to close the border now and go into extreme mitigation procedures to stop the spread before it overwhelms their hospitals."
"It does seem the USA has a lot more cases of the virus, so it might make sense. Lol, the irony, though."
"So close them, whats stopping it? Capitalism on Mexicos part. Either everyone shuts it down for a month or we all accept the spread and see what shakes out on the backside. Trying to blame this on USA while you openly allow the tourist travel..."
"World traveler- you are just sowing more political division with your blame comments.United we stand, divided we fall."

"travelernewyork I posted a link from Reuters as well, it's pretty reputable. It's not clear in the articles if they are just considering actual border closings, or halting all US citizens from travel to Mexico. And to try to blame Trump or his cabinet or try to inject your political beliefs into something that is absolutely not political is asinine(not directed at you travelernewyork)https://www.jpost.com/International/Mexico-c…https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…Edited: 10:38 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Trump called the virus a hoax six days ago. Regardless of political leaning, you cannot deny what he said, as well as his lack of effort to mitigate initially. I agree everyone should shut it down for a couple of weeks to stop the spread. My trip is impacted as well, however Isla Mujeres will still be there next go around."
Actually Trump did not call the coronavirus a hoax.https:/…As for closing the border it sounded as if he’s considering it which is a heads up for people to get home soon. He just closed the border to England and Ireland starting Monday. Expect more closures if the pandemic gets worse. I can’t be sure but it seems as if the pandemic is being exaggerated for political purposes. I mean what isn’t these days ?!
"Trump never called the corona virus, or Wuhan Corona virus as some prefer to call it a hoax. He likened the Democrats criticism of his cabinets reaction to the virus to the hoax impeachment. Any way they try to spin it, its BS. He halted flights to China, and they were outraged saying he was overreacting. Then when the virus hit US shores they said he reacted too slowly. Its despicable the way our president gets blamed for situations out of his control. https:/…Edited: 5:17 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Yes, we have reservations in Mazatlan at end of May."
"We have reservations at Mia May 10th, and unless they shut down travel we will be there."
