"Hey, so I love the idea and the spirituality behind the sak yant tattoos, but I am wary of the health risks. I've read that the tattoo needles are re used between clients. I was just wondering if anyone has had an experience with sak yant (good or bad) or if you know of a place that performs this with new needles, or if I can purchase a new needle for them to use. Love the culture but not really trying to get hepatitis or HIV on vacation :) Thanks!"
"HiSak Yant in Thai mean tattoo. The spiritual tattoo often done by monk ( monk won't do it on female for religious reason as the monk can not touch female ) or former monk because the use for the language/ script. Sak Yant is not Thai script, it is bpali Sunskrit which the Buddhist monks must studied for for pray/chanting."
"My wife and I just got them at the temple outside Bangkok. When I researched before I was read about using the same needles, but we paid and were able to get them done with brand new needles that I saw them take out of the package."
"'My wife and I just got them at the temple outside Bangkok'What temple, there is hundreds ?Edited: 6 years ago "
"Wat Bang Phra, it's about an hour by car. You can find directions by bus if you look, it was easier for us to just hire the taxi from a previous tour and he became our translator."
Thanks
Have you been since your post? And if so were you able to buy a new needle?
"If you don't mind me asking, what was the extra cost of the new needles and was it easy for them to accommodate that request?"
"Actually paid for the tattoos, I think we got hooked up because our taxi driver translated for us. Probably wouldn't have gotten them that way otherwise."
"hey everyone...i ended up getting on from wat bang phra. reused needle, but i've been good so far health wise lol (knock on wood). if i ever find myself in thailand again, i'd definitely get another."
Has it been 3months since you got the tattoo?
That's where I went too.
Gianna! So excited for you! Can you share your experience? How long did it take from the time you arrive to when you left? Which tattoo did you end up getting? Did you have a translator? Anything worth sharing I would love to hear!! Thank you!!!
Hey everyone!I'm interested in getting a sak yant from a specific Ajarn at Wat Sala Daeng in/near Bangkok. Does anyone know how to go about doing this? Who do I contact? Do I make an appointment Do I just show up? Should I bring a translator and suggestions for that?Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!
Do you know the name of the ajarn?There is one outside of bangkok named Ajarn Fu - just google him - his website is very informative
"Thanks. Yeah I have is name and his temple, I just don't know how to go about seeing him.ie: Who do I contact? Do I make an appointment Do I just show up? Should I bring a translator?"
"Email them and he has a business partner named Paul who will email you promptly and he can pick you up, tell you the price, etc. Paul speaks English so no worries there. I booked with him but actually have to cancel (bummed about this). there should be an email on the website. The email i have for Paul and Ajarn fu is enquiries@ajarn-fu.comExplain to him your situation (ie: what day you are looking to go, any questions you have, etc) and he should get back to you. He was great with helping me with my timing and recommending hotels, etc as we were originally planning to have our tattoo the day we left. hope this helps!"
"hey everyone! i ended up going to wat bang phra. the cab ride from bangkok was....interesting. i dont think our driver was the brightest bulb in the closet, but eventually we found it. looking back it's hard to remember what time we left, but i want to say around 6 or 7. i did it so we would get there right as they opened or a little before hand. our driver got lost, so we arrived maybe 20 mins after opening.our dim driver DID speak a little english so he was kind of a help. we bought our offerings and went inside. surprisingly, there weren't many people there at all. there was a group getting tattooed when we arrived but we only waited maybe 20 mins tops? if that? hard to remember. there was a thai lady there that spoke english and she said i could pick between the gord yao or the ha taew, or go upstairs where there was a guy that did the bigger, more elaborate ones. before i knew it i was up. our ""group"" up for tattoos was me, my bf, and this other group of americans. the monk that did mine was Luang Pi Nunn. he stamped me with the ha teaw outline and tattooed away.however, he used a tattoo gun on all the girls that were there. the guys got the bamboo stick. i wasn't going to complain though, even though the bamboo was what i originally wanted obviously. as it is known, he did not change the needles and re used the same ink. however, we were probably the second group of the day so i felt my hep chances were lower than if i went later on hahawhile/after tattooing he prayed over the tattoo and ""blew"" into it, and before i knew it i was done. having gone first i think i embarassed myself with my post-tattoo bowing, but the monk didn't seem offended lol. my bf went next and got the gord yao. after that our annoying driver was super rude and was like okay we can go now! ugh.anyway we left. nobody told us any ""rules"" to abide by...so i just go about my days being a good human being. i love my tattoo and i'm actually not mad in retrospect about it being done with the machine, as it's obviously more detailed than my boyfriend's. however, if/when i get more in the future i'm going to try and insist on the bamboo without being rude obviously."
"&mmonkie i got the tattoo in June and i'm still feeling good. haven't had blood work done to be sure but i'm feeling normal. i should mention, if you're in koh phangan there's this guy ajarn man who seems super cool and performs sak yant. i was originally going to see him but i missed him by one day lol"
Hopefully this is not classed as advertising but http://www.poodumtattoo.com/sak-yant-gallery/Comes recommended ...... Not in Bangkok but with a little planning easily done
Used needles - talk about tossing the dice!
Yep!
"I am speechless about this post!!I can't believe young people would be so flippant about their health.I hope that your gamble pays off and you remain in good health.Didn't really appreciate the way you referred to your driver. Calling him ' dim' is disrespectful, and disappointing. Never forget that YOU are a guest in THEIR country."
Ditto.
his level of intelligence has nothing to do with my respect for thai people. i obviously respect the culture enough to tattoo a piece of it on my back.
"just re read my post -- i wasn't referring to him as dim because he didn't speak english, though i can see how it can be misconstrued. he frustrated the living hell out of me because he drove past the place 7 times and circled around, then pulled us out of the temple prematurely because he wanted to get back to bangkok."
"Hallöchen...Ich reise bald mit einer Reisegesellschaft nach Thailand, und möchte mir ein sak yant Tattoo mit den Bambus stechen lassen. Ich habe mich informiert, und möchte wissen, WO ich das machen kann. Vielleicht könnt ihr mir helfen, und mir eine Adresse schicken, oder eine Internet Seite empfehlen. Ich hab gehört, das man das in Bangkok fast überall an jeder Ecke machen kann. Stimmt das ? Wie kann man sich das vorstellen?Durch die Reisegesellschaft habe ich leichte bedenke, da wir unterandern sportlich unterwegs sein werden, und im Meer schwimmen gehen. Wir haben Freizeit, und können auf eigene Faust los, die Zeit könnte jedoch begrenzt sein.... so für ein Paar Stündchen. Reicht die Zeit aus ?Eine Touristin die jetzt ein Tattoo hat, meinte das es in wenigen Stunden abgeheilt ist, und nach einen Tag kann man normal Trekken/Schwimmen ect. Stimmt das ?Das sind übrigens unsere Orte, und ich würde mich riesig freuen, wenn jemand mit Erfahrung weiß, wo man sich eins stechen lassen kann.Bangkok Ayutthaya Sukhothai Lampang Thaton Mae On Sup Chiang Mai Ko Chang Über eine Antwort würde ich mich sehr freuen :)MFGLisa"
"@Lisa R, I think you are asking if your itinerary is ok perhaps, but it would be much better in English for the majority of us reading it."
"Okay I'll try. This has now been translated by a Website :)Hey ... I travel soon with a tour company in Thailand and would like to leave me a sak Yant tattoo pierce with bamboo. I have informed me, and want to know where I can do that. Maybe you can help me, and send me an address, or recommend an Internet page. I heard that you can make the almost everywhere on every corner in Bangkok. Is that right? How can you imagine that? By Travel company I consider light, because we will be among other sporty road, and go swimming in the sea. We have free time and can rid on your own, however, the time may be limited .... so for a few hours. Do I have enough time? A tourist who now has a tattoo, said that it has healed in a few hours, and after a day, you can normally trekking / swimming ect. Is that right? That's the way our cities, and I would be very happy if someone knows with experience, where you can let yourself sting one. Bangkok Ayutthaya Sukhothai Lampang Thaton Mae On Sup Chiang Mai Ko Chang About a response I would be very happy :) MFG Lisa"
"Only certain temples do Sak Yant so it is not true you can get it on every street corner. I would not enter into this lightly and whilst the Sak Yant tattoos are supposed to heal very quickly I recently saw a post from someone who had had one done and was experiencing pain and soreness some days after. I cannot tell you anywhere to have it done other than the temple in Nakhon Pathom, but you won't be near that one, so perhaps Google it for other places."
I have take my researched and i have founded a hiv virus dont survive more than 2 seconds outside the body!!! soo the rest is just have a vacine
Then how do you explain the HIV epidemic happening among heroin users sharing needles? The two second rule only applies to dropped food.
"Hello,I was wondering what temple you got your Sak Yant tattoo done? Where did you purchase new needles? Was it traditional in the sense they picked where you received your tattoo and what it was or did you pick out your design as well? Thank you so much!!!!"
I got mine here in my place in Malaysia. An Ajarn came down so I went and get sakyant. he does change the needles tho. Throwing the old ones (before me) into the dustbin and sanitize everything with alcohol. :)The art work is beautiful i would say :)
"Reply to ChickenWingSoup: Her research is partially correct in that the HIV virus cannot survive more than a few seconds after being exposed to air. To answer your question, HIV is transmitted among IV drug users because the blood is transferred to the vacuum container within the syringe before being injected back into the vein. Despite being out of the body, it never comes into contact with air, thus survives.How this is relevant to sak yant: there's no risk of HIV infection during the tattoo process."

is there a good sak yant place in Bangkok?
"went in for a sak yant tattoo but wanted to see the place first to check it out to make sure it was a clean, professional place and it was, in fact first class all the way, with my work done by the master of sak yant there (a bamboo stick job) he was fast, professional an when I his work was done they had an assistant clean and put a clear patch on my work, first time I had seen this type of covering but it worked like a charm, I would recommend this for anyone wanting work"
Could you tell me the location and name of the tattooist please?
"Hi Ben. U mean at wat bang phra or tattoo parlour in Bangkok? As far as i read thru , the tattoo work environment in wat bang phra is a bit shocking ."
Yes does anyone know if one more central in Bangkok? I wouldn't get one unless the needles were changed and the same ink tub wasn't used for everyone. Can't understand anyone that would take that risk...bizarre!!
"To those who aren't Theravadan Buddhists, and likely don;t understand any of the symbolism of Sak Yant nor hold the associated mystical beliefs, do you think perhaps that this is cultural appropriation that might be seen as disrespectful?"
"Just wanted to leave a comment for people thinking of getting this as I was upset at the way a “arjan” (teacher training to be a monk) treated me. I contacted an arjan for a Sak Yant tattoo. Basically, I am half Thai, half English. I hold a thai ID card, passport and I can speak thai, although not fluently. I looked at this arjan’s facebook page and found some nice sak yant tattoos he did for people, and someone commented on a photo asking how much, and he said “525 baht”. When I rang and spoke to him on the phone, I asked him how much it would be, and he told me 5000 baht. I was in shock, because he knew I was half thai and this price is extortionate – over £100! I asked him to lower the price because I am Thai and this was clearly the price he charges westerners. He asked if my mum was Thai, I said yes and he said then 4000. I replied that I am thai, I have a thai passport, why do I have to pay more? That’s extremely unfair. He said no, your mother is thai so you get a discount but you are still white. I could not believe this. He then starts haggling me, saying his tattoos are really beautiful and that when I see it I will be happy to pay 5000. I told him I read his facebook and found that he was charging 525baht. To which he replied, its 525 for them because they are Thai. At this point, he could tell I was getting upset so started going back on what he said, saying I can pay whatever I want. After this phonecall, he then messaged me asking for my facebook page. I was already upset at this point and did not feel comfortable giving it out because of my profile picture – I may be half thai but I look more like my father, so have a more Western face. I then replied telling him I did not want the tattoo and would not be going to get it. All my life I have faced racism – be it in England and being called a “chink”, to people like this arjan in Thailand, telling me im “not thai”. If you are thinking of getting a sak yarn tattoo… DO NOT PAY 5000!!! This is an absolute rip off and they are basically capitalising religion and this is a sin in Buddhist teaching (and you should tell them that if they try to overcharge!). I wanted the tattoo for protection as I am planning to report from warzones for my journalism career, but I felt this guy was not authentic and I was insulted that he would say that I am not Thai when I clearly am. Anything over 1000 baht is not worth it guys. A true monk/arjan does not use sacred tattoos for personal gain, they should be done to help and protect the person if they believe them to be worthy."

I've reported both poster #45 and 46 as spamming/advertising.Business must be rough if you have to be dodgy and spam forum boards for business.
The trend must be winding down. Time to find a new trend the suckers will spend their money on.
"What’s your “level of intelligence” getting a tattoo with reused needles? And you say you’re healthy because you feel normal, but didn’t get any blood test... Feeling “normal” doesn’t mean anything. Diseases can get into your system without symptoms. This post blew my mind completely."
Me puede decir el nombre del tomo. Si le hacen el tatuaje con bambú y el dolor?
