"Hi all, I have a trip to Malta planned in mid-March and I am getting concerned about the coronavirus outbreak in Northern Italy. I understand Malta is an island nation off the coast of Italy (so it is separate), but I was wondering if anyone in Malta right now is concerned? I assume there is a lot of travel between Italy and Malta so potentially the virus could spread. Is anyone canceling their trips to the region now?If anyone has any thoughts on this or local info, that would be much appreciated. Thanks!"
100% temperature screening of all arriving air and sea passengers starts this week so Malta is taking precautions as are many other countries and there are no health warnings against travel to Malta.
"Up till now there are no reports of coronavirus in Malta. But, as you said, there is a lot of travel between Malta and Italy and especially Sicily. Many citizens are on high alert due to proximity of Italy to Malta.Things may very much change until the end of the week, let alone mid-March."
"We are here at the moment due to go home on thursday. I have one of the conditions that puts me ""at risk"" but didnt consider cancelling for a moment! I am a swine flu survivor so hope to get through coronavirus too if needed. Fingers crossed I get home ok"
I believe someone has tested positive in Sciliy now. That’s only twenty miles from Malta ( am I correct?) We’ve just made the decision to defer booking a holiday in September this year for a month or two - we were going to book by the end of this week but have decided to see how things evolve in the next few weeks before paying our deposit. We’re not ruling out the holiday but just delaying the final decision...
"Sicily is very close to Malta - 40 minutes by plane or just a ferry ride away (keeping in mind they're 2 separate islands). If there's means of deferring booking, I personally would opt for that choice although I know many would disagree. As it stands things are up in the air and I'd rather book a trip when things have settled down."
That’s all we’ve decided to do - just delay for a month or two - a wait and see approach. We’ve time on our side. Six months to our preferred dates in September. Still keeping the dates free in our diary. We’ll have a better idea in a few weeks time.
"Thanks all for the thoughts! Unfortunately I have already booked flights to/from Malta and a hotel, but the hotel is refundable at least (and the flights weren’t too bad from within Europe). I’ll wait and see how the situation unfolds, but hoping I do get to visit this beautiful island for the first time!"
"We were booked to go to Vietnam this week. A few weeks back we cancelled and lost our flight money paid. We have booked Malta and we ""will"" be going.Take sensible precautions, wash your hands, use hand sanitiser and antibacterial wipes on the plane for table and seat belt.Edited: 2:15 am, February 26, 2020 "
We have two elderly ladies in their late seventies in our traveling party - they would struggle badly to cope if they became ill abroad. It sounds like you are going soon (?) and I hope you have a wonderful trip. We’re not going til early September and it could be a worldwide problem/lockdown by then if it gets out of control. There’s big enough changes by the week. Six months is quite a long time... we don’t have to decide right now so we haven’t - out of an abundance of cautioun. But we wish you well on your trip. It must have been disappointing to lose the cost of the flight to Vietnam...
"Just to add that I think flu is a greater killer worldwide than Covid-19 and it doesn’t get the same headline coverage. I read somewhere that 6,000 people died of flu in the US last year but it doesn’t rate a mention in the news! The media loves a horror story!! So let’s keep it in perspective."
"Yes the media loves to make a drama out of a crisis although you do have to be careful.We are booked for the end of March & unless told not to we will be going,both near 70 & have too much still to enjoy to let a bug stop us!Let's face it,put it off & there is always another crisis around the corner!"
"Yes you are right.. in 2008/9 13,000 people died in the UK from Flu. I don't remember all this publicity then. Every year there is a flu virus going round the world, if we all take care, washing hands and using anti septic gels all the time, we will have done our best."
"I'd personally be more worried over being stuck in quarantine in a foreign country, or constantly being on edge that the situation may change to that similar to Italy's. That would ruin my holiday. The situation in Europe is getting worse not better. But I do recognise that this is a very risk averse approach."
The difference between the flu and Covid-19 is the reaction of the health authorities - they seem to accept flu as a fact of life but are on high alert for Covid-19. Not that they should ignore it but they’ll confine you to quarantine if they suspect Covid-19 infection but not for flu!! The Spanish flu in 1918 or was it 1920 killed 20 million - more than the First World War! But being on edge and afraid of being confined to a hotel room for two weeks would spoil the enjoyment of a holiday for most people... you want a carefree break when on holidays! Everyone will have to weigh up the risks for themselves...
"Google “ How many people died from flu last year worldwide”The result I got from this search says 291,000 to 646,000 died - according to medicinenet.comSo without wanting to belittle all the awful fatalities from Covid-19, it’s dwarfed by the death toll from seasonal flu worldwide!Just to put it into perspective..."
"Rather than Googling how many people died of the flu, I think it'd make more sense comparing mortality rates. In Italy we're hearing of a new death every few hours. I've read that the mortality rate of the flu is 0.1% compared to Covid-19's 2%. Then again it's reported that the majority of people recover and we know how the media sensationalizes events."
"I’m home now, an amazing few days in Malta. There were quite a few people wearing masks at the airport, not sure why as I have read it only protects others from getting it from you, and hand washing is far more important. There doesn’t seem to be much news about “survivors” or descriptions of what it’s like. The media are just winding everyone up. I hope you all enjoy your Malta holiday as much as we did ( the carnival was amazing!)"
"Thermal screened on arrival today.The issue is a rapid escalation to quarantine, should Malta see its first case. That could impact anyone.Edited: 8:29 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Yes there's travel between Italy and Malta, in fact the Italians are the main tourist after the brits, followed by a mix of other Europeans then other western countries even Eastern, you get quite a mix of nationalities.A friend of mine flew in yesterday they were screened they'd flown in from France via the UK. There asking questions apparently of where you come from, which part of said country and have you being in area where the virus may be,being in contact with anyone who has being to an area where the virus is etc, said it took them about half hour longer to get through customs because of this, was causing queues, not massive ones, but eneugh to flow you down a little.Eileen"
"Hi, I'm also going to Malta at the same time with my partner but the worry for me is if flights are cancelled. According to UK news, so far there have been no cases in Malta declared so I really don't think we'll have problems (fingers crossed).Good luck."

It’s a 45 min plane trip from Malta to Sicily
"We are booked to go to Malta this week, but have changed our minds due to Coronavirus. My husband is 86 and has diabetes. Rather than take the risk, I wouldfeel safer at home, not so much the hotel but the airport and flights.Edited: 4:00 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Norma, don't forget you can claim taxes back that were paid on flights"
"Schools in Italy have closed. Italy has the highest cases following Asian countries. Meanwhile we have several flights to and from Italy weekly and not a single person has yet been reported to have the virus although all Western European countries do. The news has changed so many times it's hard to keep track, but the latest news is that it is NOT like influenza. We are a small island. We do not have regions to close off once the first cases are reported. But arrive to your own conclusions.Edited: 3:17 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Mt-avid traveller the reasons other European countries have it at guess and Malta dosent this is going too sound awful but I don't mean it that way is that they have a higher population of Chinese and Asian who visit there family, friends in there countries of origin, also a higher rate of Asian tourists also, it was a Chinese Dr who started the hotel cases in tenerife for instance, it was reported he'd actually treated people in Hulan China, tested negative originally so gone on holiday to tenerife to find he actually had the virus and that's how it spread there, similar in France a Chinese tourist took unwell was found too have the virus, here in the UK it's thought to be people who've visited infected Asian countries such as China not realising they picked up the virus like the Chinese parent who caused a school to be closed and infected a teacher etc, Malta is screening everyone on arrival I believe now so hopefully they'll keep it a bay,because like you said with the island being so small they can't shut off areas like they have in Italy and places,so dread to think how it'd be maintained to one area after all your beautiful Isle is smaller than most Capitol cities throughout the world.Eileen"
"I have a back up plan that I came up with in case our trip was cancelled,my Wife is truly hoping that it doesn't come to that as she is desperate for somewhere hot & doesn't think my plan B,Belfast,fits the bill!!!"
"We're booked for September only for a week, as suppose to be going gerona Italy too see friends from Malta for a week, we'll def be going Malta, will have too see about gerona tho. Lol.Eileen"
"Eileen, the recent and, as far as I remember reading, majority of European transmissions are now traced to persons that had previously visited Italy not China."
"The two cases I outlined certainly weren't they were traced back to China.But it makes sense more recent cases would trace to Italy, the UK and other European countries do have a lot of travel between them and Italy be it tourism or people visiting family and friends, but once again the virus originated from China originally so there must of being a tourist or some one who'd visited China for it too get Italy in the first place, my husband is a chef in an Italian restaurant where we live, one of the other chefs have just got back from North West Italy he'd visited family, the owner and boss who is from Naples told him not to set foot in his restaurant, to isolate himself for 2 weeks, he said its not fare on other staff and his customers to allow him to eotk, to be fare the bloke has isolated himself for 2 weeks, he's fine and back at work on Monday, but too me it's irresponsible of people who know they've being to a highly infected area (country) to go out and infect others, but it would seem people have done just that, personally I think as soon as it came out about the virus in China every country should of closed its borders to flights in and out of China, OK wouldn't of stopped it completely as China did its usual and didn't take action straight away so it wasn't known to the rest of the world, but it would have contained it more if our borders were closed to flights etc from China.Eileen"
"Absolutely, countries should have closed borders immediately. But nobody wants to harm their tourism industry so flights are going on almost normally. And any tourists coming in from Italy to Malta are not quarantining themselves whilst on holiday. Thermal screening doesn't mean 100% no virus good to go. So in reality barely anything is being done to prevent cases."
"Obviously it dosent guarantee 100% but it will show a fever up, which is one of the symptoms of the virus, but if the person hasn't yet started with the virus then yes it's pretty useless, still more than what most other countries are doing tho, isn't it.Eileen"
"@ Simone W ""It's only a type of flu!"" *No* it's not!!!"
"Dale yes your correct it's not a type of flu, what people need to get into perspective is that fact of comparing it to flu, yes flu kills around 675 thousand worldwide a year, that's in a year, look at how many deaths in 2 months from corona virus, times it by 10,its a lot more than flu, there's a vaccine to help people prevent getting flu also, nothing for this tho, could be years before, if at all, now I sound like I'm scaremongering. Lol. I'm not, as long as your fit, no serious underlying conditions, or very old or very young as there immune systems are compromised because of age either through age, or not fully formed ie babies, toddlers etc, then most people will recover fully, just like they would with flu, but it's not flu your correct, but it is a virus quite a deadly one to some, luckily I'm in good health overall, and do are most people, so not too worried, would I deliberately go on holiday to somewhere with a big outbreak, would I hell I'd be an idiot if I did, what gets me is all these people coming from highly infected places ie holidays, seeing family etc why risk infecting others, airports, ports, borders, should of being closed to these countries a long time ago, then maybe just maybe we wouldn't be seeing what's happening in Italy, and quite possibly could happen throughout Europe.Eileen"
"Is it any coincidence that the rise of this ""glorified common cold"" coincides with the seemingly ever growing daft trend towards Vegan foods (the so called Rebel Whopper, and the Vegan Bake from those ""sausage roll people"" Gr***s,on the high street?)Never had diseases like this back in the day did you eh when all this food fads weren't about?"
"If we concentrate on eradication of the worlds diseases and viruses and increase the average life expectancy in 50-100 years the population will be in the region of 14 billion, the worlds resources that we now consider normal and essential for simply living, will be scarce commodities (breathable air, clean drinking water, living areas on normal earth as opposed to on sea water accommodation) horded by the super rich in their gated very high security residences.The remainder, the 98% of the world population will be forced to live in a dystopian world akin to Mad Max post apocalyptic universe.That is if we are not wiped out first by any of the following :Yellowstone Super Volcano eruptionImpending untracked asteroid impactNuclear WarGlobal flooding..The future? Its as above (or worse!)For the record, there are parts of Scotland that have a lower life expectancy than that of the Peoples Democratic Republic of The Congo, and they have Ebola**Ebola? That WOULD be something to stop football etc. over! The Tyson Fury of viruses !!"
"This thread has turned into a discussion on coronavirus. Can we restrict it to coronavirus/Malta please. For those of us planning our trip soon I was keeping an eye on it so as to ascertain number of cases (if any) in Malta, what airports ,shops, tourist sites are doing etc.Thanks."

"Best look at The Times of Malta or Malta Today (local papers) really. Bar a few exceptions this forum is frequented by non-residents and is a case of ""your guess is as good mine"" . You probably won't find anything cast iron on here with regards to the current status am afraid."
"https:/…Novel-coronavirus.aspxNo cases as yet reported on Malta. Link above re the virus, and defense against it, The maltese are screening anyone entering the country, any form of fever the person will be tested, quarantined. So it looks like they won't get into Malta as such if any cases they'll be taken straight to quarantine.Dosent look like there has even being any suspected cases from screeing so far, which amazes me with the amount of travel between Italy and Malta especially sicilliy, so looks like the maltese are doing a good job stopping it entering, or just lucky so far. Eileen"
"Merseymcc se link I posted its a Maltese government site.Shops, sites etc are operating as normal at the moment, The only way onto Malta is air, or ferry from sicily or a cruise, it says there screeing all arrivals, anyone with a fever will be tested and quarantined, so looks like there trying to stop it entering, this will only work tho if the people entering show symptoms on screening, it can take 24 hours plus for symptoms to appear my cousin told me who is a doctor, so not entirely fool proof, but more th n some countries are doing.

We go to malta tomorrow I am 75 my wife is 63 I have blood pressure my wife isn't too bad we can't get our money back is it safe to go
Only you can make that decision...could you check with your GP before leaving.
"Micheal where are you from if its the UK then we have 273 active cases and 3 deaths albeit 1 of those deaths was not in the UK, it was a UK national on holiday. Malta has 3 active cases, no other cases as of yet past or present, no deaths as of yet, I'd say going on them figures and the fact ours rose overnight from 209 to 273,maltas still only has 3,I'd say Malta is safer than the UK at the moment, not saying that won't change after all one thing this virus has shown it can increase in just a few hours, keep an eye on maltas local papers, use Google, keep yourself posted up too you going and while away, that way you will no the situation and know whether to go, or if there, where, what to avoid.Eileen"
"We are off to Malta in 2 weeks,I'm slightly younger than Michael with blood pressure & my Wife is slightly older than his with Diabetes,we are more concerned with missing a trip than catching something.Knowing my luck we would decide not to go then one of us would take a trip to our local Tescos,all of 100 yards away from home & come into contact with someone there & fall ill!Life is just full of such decisions!"
Charlie T - it all depends on what you mean by safe.
"As of yesterday when I left Malta they had 3 cases all in the same family and all isolated. I think whether going represents a higher or lower risk than the UK depends, I travel by tube into central London daily so Malta didn’t worry me but I don’t have health issues."
"At the moment , they have 3 cases of the virus."

I have just seen that Mater Dei hospital have drastically reduced visiting hours and that all visitors will be screened. I think it is just half hour in the mornings and one hour in the evenings and only 1 visitor allowed.
How is it in Malta now? Leaving for Malta from US on 3.16
Fourth case announced today. 100% lockdown in nearest neighbour Italy. Expecting escalation here.
"4 confirmed cases, all recently travelled to northern Italy. The prime minister announced that all travel between Malta and Italy will stop."
Wish we were doing the same in the UK....think all flights should be stopped from Italy
"Darn....Just bought 2 prepaid seats for the 7:00am flight out of Luton next Wednesday. too much scare mongering and I'll be the only one on it! Oh , me and 6 no doubt well fit stewardesses and a trolley load of beer.Some ya win eh?"
"We're off tomorrow, can't wait....either not many checked in or lots of empty seats"

"Holy water is being removed from church fonts on the advice of the health authorities because of coronavirus (Covid-19), the curia in Malta and Gozo have announced.The fonts are seen as posing a risk because people dip their fingers in them.Parish priests were advised to remove the water from church fonts in circulars issued on Monday.Parish priests had previously also been advised to only give holy communion on the hand and to ensure that the celebrant disinfects his hand beforehand.The Church authorities in Malta and Gozo also called for prayers for the victims of coronavirus and those taking care of them. Priests were told to organise special prayers for the spread of the virus to stop. (Times of Malta).That's it, my faith is lost I mean surely nothing evil would dare get near holy water, would it?"
I'm due to go to Malta on 16 April so keeping everything crossed.. and an eye on everything!
5th case announced according to the Times of Malta.
"Flights to/fro Malta- Italy are haulted...currently there are 5 cases in Malta, all 5 infected are Italians who live here and who visited north Italy... they stayed quarantined upon returning back to the island and are currently quarantined at the local hospital. The Maltese are concerned about the outbreak, so do not be surprised to see someone wearing a mask. Overall, I think it is safe as it is in other parts of Europe, and everyone is carrying on with daily routines."
"Me too, I leave 19th April from Melb AustraliaEdited: 11:46 pm, March 10, 2020 "

"Starting to bore me all this. Just hearing that they are ""cancelling"" the St Patricks Day celebrations in St Julian's. Closing The Dubliner pub all day. Yeah that should work, how can you ""cancel"" a date? What is stopping people just going out, in a public space and celebrating?It's all just multi-media gone mad. Not saying it is ""fake news"" but for sure it is over exaggerated. Why don't we just let it run its course. Let life go on as normal. If folk get it, they get it and it is no more lethal than the myriad of other inconvenient illnesses there are out there.Its suffering from a PR nightmare if you ask me. By naming it THE CORONAVIRUS it sounds probably a lot worse than it actually is.Perhaps at its outset in China they named it a ""quite a dodgy strain of the common cold"" things may have been a bit different eh?PS Holy water is holy water Elaine. The older I get, the more religious I am becoming."
Had to laugh how last weekend they stopped footballers shaking hands as a risk prevention measure but seemingly forgot to tell the players not to shake hands(& more!)at the final whistle!
"There are till now six cases of coronavirus in Malta. The numbers are getting higher every day. This is a small island, with limited resources and I honestly don't think that the hospital here is well prepared if the virus spreads further. I suggest cancelling your flight to Malta for the moment. Better safe than sorry."
"Your concern is greatly appreciated but I'm afraid it's a big nope from me. 6 out of a total of 493,559 = about 0.001% of the population. Meaning 99.999% are probably OK. You can't just ""cancel your flight for the time being"", you just cancel. Mr O'Leary at Ryanair (among other fliers) plus hotels etc. will not be forthcoming with refunds unless Malta is designated a no-go area. The chances of that? Pretty low I would say.Take all the hype with a large pinch of salt, follow the basic personal hygiene requests and come and enjoy your holidays."
"Are those downplaying it aware of what is going on in Italy? It is far from ""quite a dodgy strain of the common cold"".TheStath, if you've been in Malta for St Patrick's before, I'm sure you're aware that it's more than just turning up at a bar. Pubs and bars usually host big events. Streets are VERY overcrowded. It's not just people merrily drinking in bars.Edited: 9:01 am, March 11, 2020 "
Our flight from Bratislava to Malta is tomorrow. It's only a short three day trip. Should we cancel?
"Hardly Ebola is it?Those that are dying are dying of ""other more serious issues"". Children don't actually contract this virus.So what we are saying then is , those that are at risk are already seriously ill.The remainder may feel a bit groggy for a week or so but will recover.And children are not affected.No I reemphasise my point this is actually less serious than a heavy cold, or flu?In the time this thread has been in existence I dare say more people have been maimed or killed on Malta's roads.Does that stop folk coming on here to enquire as to what is the best car hire company?Take a realistic look at things and as for Italy? Well say no more eh? Never a great nation to show any strength on the national stage.St Patricks Day? No never but I dare say it isn't a patch on Dublin, and they are cracking on with it all.Oh and Ryan's Bar is flinging opens its doors in St Julian'sEdited: 9:09 am, March 11, 2020 "

"I can say what I like within reason , it's a free travel forum and my ""words of wisdom"" as you so eloquently put are backed up shear un-adulterated common sense.You sir if I may say so are just a doom monger. You really are. I think I can safely say that give it a matter of a few weeks, when all the drama has subsided , we will wonder quite what all the fuss was all about.So folks unless your airline sends you a text saying that your flight is cancelled then follow the self hygiene practices and go and have a great holiday.You'll regret it if you don't when you have lost 100's or even 1000's of euros or pounds.I am, I go on March 18th and I am VERY much looking forward to it."
"You are giving advice without reading our local news or being in the country itself, so I rest my case.

"Note the current travel ban for people travelling from Italy is to be expanded from midnight to cover France, Germany Spain and Switzerland ‘Prime Minister Robert Abela told a press conference on Wednesday afternoon that arrivals from those four countries today, and anyone who arrived from Italy in the past 14 days has to observe mandatory quarantine at home.People who live in the same residence also need to observe quarantine. Tourists have to stay in their hotel rooms.Arrangements would be made for meals to be delivered to people in quarantine. Arrangements will also be made for the repatriation of stranded travellers.Spot checks will be made by the police and anyone failing to observe quarantine orders will be subject to a €1,000 fine.‘"
"https:/…A 16 year old girl with the corona virus after being to Italy too see family, has being receiving death threats after posting a photo, of her in bar saying to hell with self isolation, apparently she did it as joke, the photo was taken before she went to Italy,OK yes it was a stupid thing too do, 16 year old do stupid things, death threats seem a bit over the top, but then the people making them didn't realise it was a joke. Not sure how I feel about this to be honest, yes it was joke, but apparently she visited a friend while in isolation, this friend was also in isolation as she'd being in Italy also, but seems ab it irresponsible to me, the parents should of not let her go, isolation means isolation no contact, or going out, incase you infect others. Eileen"
"No I am paying attention to my airline and my hotel company.So far Ryanair have categorically stated that no flights at the moment are affected from the UK.Travel Republic have assured me that I am to carry on with my holiday plans regardless.You sir are putting the fear of god into folk who will no doubt hit the panic button and cancel holidays when there may not be a valid reason to do so, costing holiday makers 1000's. So yes by all means read the Malta Times, but newspapers never let truth get in the way of a good headline grabbing story (misery sells) .I wonder pre 24 hours rolling news and Social Media would anything like this have caused such a stir? It's people panicking that is making an awkward situation far far worse and why are they panicking? Because the media has gone into over drive!I am absolutely furious the way this has been managed, using a sledge hammer to crack a nut.Its ludicrous."
"If people listen to you and only pay attention to airline and hotel companies they may end up finding themselves in quarantine if they are coming from banned places, and that is definitely a waste of money."
"@Stath, Given the news today that the travel ban has been extended to include 4 more countries and given that we are being told to expect a spike in cases in the U.K. over the next week or so, it’s quite conceivable that the U.K. will be added to the list soon. Therefore, unfortunately I do think your flight on the 18th is in some doubt."
"What is happening in Italy is terrible, I fo ferl for the people there, however Malta does seem to be taking more steps to contain the virus than what Italy did, earlier on, the screening at the airport, enforcing self isolation with a fine, arranging food for those isolated, stopping large gatherings ie organised events etc, it took Italy a while to do that, and even now its in lock down with law enforcement patrolling you still see people walking and driving about, to me lock down means stay isolated unless it's emergency untill your told you don't need too.Just wish the UK government would take more decisive action, Boris speech certainly didn't reassure me.Stath it's not a flu, and yes it's mainly the old, or people with medical conditions more at risk, but where did you read it dosent affect children, yes it does tell that to the 14 and 16 year old girls in Malta who are 2 out of the 6 cases there. It can also be bad for babies also as there immune system is still developing, my information comes from a reliable source my cousin who is Dr at one Britain's biggest children's hospitals, also an ex RAF doctor. Eileen"
"Answering The Strait. Thank you for your numerous comments, where you seem to know everything without actually being in Malta or following the news here. It's people like you who keep Trip Advisor going.I was directing my answer at the person who asked the question originally, not to you. He or she asked for a local opinion. I gave it. It's just a personal opinion. He or she can make their own decision.  I must point out, however, that I'm not concerned about the virus on a personal basis, since I'm healthy and relatively young. I'm concerned, however, for the elderly and vulnerable, as we all should be."
"Myself and my wife have booked a holiday in Malta on 1st April,she is disabled and got health issues we're both worried about coming over. Which is a shame as we were really excited up until recently. I'm keeping a close eye on the latest developments Any advice??"
"Bit presumptuous isn't it? I've spent the best part of last two years there, the bird (lady friend) lives in Qawra whom I speak to daily and I am reliably informed that it is very much business as usual for the hotels and the area in general. There is no panic on the ground , no carts going round requesting you to ""bring out your dead"" and place a big red cross on your door. ""Bag and tag ya granny"" leaflets not distributed. So, until Ryanair and my hotel company tell me otherwise I am sure to be going next week. It is scare mongers,drama queens and conspiracey theorists the world over which are fueling this situation. Someone somewhere is making an awful lot of money out of this. The world needs to calm down, take a step back and have a reality check."
"Kevin just keep an eye on the news, how and where or if it escalates, your not going for 3 weeks or so a lot could happen in that time, it could escalate or it could burn out and all be over, however Malta have allready stopped flights to and from 4 countries including Italy within Europe, so if it escalates in the UK, you may find that they add the UK to that list, if that happens then your airline will have to refund you.However if it escalates in Malta wouldn't suprise me if the Maltese government stop flights from everywhere and put the country into shutdown they've being pretty fast at acting so far, they were one of the first countries to screen people at the airport, there one of the first to ban flights from countries with a high outbreak, so dosent look like they'll mess about. Eileen"
My husband and I were due to go also 23rd April. My husband suffers from ill health also and this would have been our very first foreign holiday but now the excitement has been taken over by worry so I also will be watching the situation closely. Health is definitely more important and other people's safety
Hi! I read this health article from gov in Malta! https:/…Novel-coronavirus.aspxI am going to Malta from Poland 20th of March. Here they say `Avoid non-essential travel to these countries with local transmission (Poland). This states the opposite direction I guess also.
"@TheStrait I'm sorry for whatever happened to you to make you react this way. Take good care of yourself.To everyone else that is concerned about flying to Malta, I reckon that each person should follow the news and make his/her own decision accordingly. @Katrinaag Your flight is in a month and a lot can happen till then. I hope that the virus will remain to be contained and that it doesn't aggravate, so that you and your husband can enjoy your holiday here."
@angeld I sincerely hope so too as I've always wanted to visit your beautiful country
"Following the news in Malta carefully as me the husband and 2 kids, 7 year old and 9 month old, are due to come out on May the 5th of May for a week. I would have a weakened immune system due to medication so I would be at risk. Hoping that's it starts to die down by then. It's good that the airport is screening people coming into the airport. Hopefully with travel being banned from Italy, it won't spread as quick"
"Contrary to what has been posted on here I believe that St Patrick's Day parade in both Cork & Dublin have been cancelled,I guess the end result will probably be even more crowded bars!"
"I likely think that in the coming days that most of ""Europe"" will escalate to lockdown for 30 days. Many hotels here are already on skeleton staff and not operating fully. Only hoping the corner is turned quickly."
"People just love it don't they eh? Just love doom and gloom. They love worrying. Nothing else in their sad empty lives than to sit there and wait bad news. I speak from personal experience as all my dad does is sit there in his kitchen with Sky News on. A murmur in North Korea and its ""oh well, get tin hats out""...Don Trumpy says something and ""I'm off to the bottom of the garden to dig a bunker""...folk on here in the past have stated ""Brexit? Oh well that's us back to the dark ages""....its cobblers! Was just speaking to a bloke in an (empty) gym more sanitisers than people and we both don't buy in to this mass hysteria. In the past 2 decades we have witnessed :Foot and Mouth disease vast amounts of burning animals : result? No ArmageddonBird flu? Result? Sorry, no ArmageddonSwine flu? Result? Again, we're all still hereMad Cows Disease? Sorry folks, we survived that oneEbola in Africa? ContainedThis will be the same. Mark my words. And yes hotels are on skeleton staff as its still very much out of season...6 days and I'll be in Malta cold beer and fun in the sun. So lets have some positivity can we please!Thank-you."
I am under lockdown in Italy at the moment. I would postpone your trip. Malta has closed its borders to Italy but that aside now is definitely not the time to be travelling to anywhere in Europe.
"Nope. Not until I have been officially told that there will be problems on my arrival. I have waited 3 long months since my last visit I am not bottling out of this one...As yet there are absolutely no restrictions on travellers arriving from the UK to Malta. You get screened at the airport on arrival, if you are good to go you are good to go.If I feel feverish between now and then I'll think about it but am smashing my gym at the moment and fitter than ever.So as far as I'm concerned my seat on my plane will have me on it next week!"
"Just because your country is not on the list of banned flights to Malta right now does not mean that you should travel here. Travelling here just because you want to have a holiday is simply selfish and irresponsible. Malta is small and we have one hospital with very limited beds. It is doubtful if we can take care of more than 30 people if this virus spreads. We have another case today, and while you may think that 9 cases are not many, for this Island they are. We also are understaffed and over worked. As from yesterday one of the doctors got infected too. Right now the prime minister has asked everyone from the age of 60 upwards to stay indoors. So please do not come to our island right now. You may be carriers, or you may pick up the virus on the flight. Choose not to infect those at risk."
"Anyone travelling from the United States needs to contact there airline or travel provider, Donald Trump has banned all flights to and from mainland Europe the only countries this foes not affect at the moment are the UK and Ireland, it includes Malta that's probably because you have fly via another European country or maybe trump being the chump he is dosent realise Malta is an island nation and has no land border.Eileen"
"Okee dokee Mark...want me to wear sack cloth and ashes too?I'll do that then, just for you OH PM me then perhaps you can weigh me in the cost of my flight (as that will not be refundable) the cost of my hotel (as neither will that as I am within 7 days of travelling) and the difference in the amount I bought my euro's for and the amount I will get back if I attempt to change them into sterling again?Fancy that? Be about 500-600 quid...No? Well I, like no doubt 1000's of others will until we know different will be out and about in Malta next week"
"Stath I understand what you are saying, but please read the last post from a Maltese, he is correct in saying that the Matrei dei will not likely to cope with more than 30 cases, after all you know its a tiny nation, dosent have the resources of bigger nations, now I'm not saying your going to go and infect people, but as pointed out flying is high risk at the moment, you could contact it on the plane, you may not either, now I'm no scaremonger you know that, in fact I've allready said that providing my airline is flying when we are due to go in September (hopefully it'll of died down by then) then I will be going Malta, however if its still escalating or in a pandemic stage where flights are stopped or cancelled then obviously I won't, I do feel tho that if I assed and feel we shouldn't then we won't, the reason I'm saying still going at the moment is because I feel the maltese economy is going to take a hit and as Malta was like a second home to me while growing up I should do my bit and go if I can and spend my euros to help support there economy.Just a word of warning tho keep checking your flight, as the EU lifted restrictions on airlines having to operate 80% of there flights yesterday, so if your flight is less than half empty because lots are cancelling due to the virus and not travelling, Ryan Air may cancel it as there no longer obliged to run it.Ryan sir and other airlines have relaxed rules and are allowing people to change flights at no extra cost, or even cancel and get a refund, obviously if a flight ban or they cancel they have to refund you under EU law. EileenEdited: 4:51 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Booking agents, travel agents are also allowing people to amend, change and cancel bookings at no extra cost, and refunding also, it's all being on the news, it happening, so Stath your very likely to be able to get your money back or change your flights and hotel to another date at no extra charge, within reason of course.Eileen"
"We seem to be forgetting that folk are screened at arrivals. Show any signs of having a bug, you'll be hauled away somewhere to fester, pretty fool proof really...That flight will run even if there is nobody on it. If its legal to land indeed a 1/4 full flight would no doubt put a smile (ish) on Michael O'Leary's chops as it would burn a lot less fuel if only a 1/4 full...And come (Eileen) you do have a bit of form for panicking , remember the day after the Brexit vote came in? Kind of bricked it a bit then didn't you?The only thing that will stop me or 2 pals (1 today from Liverpool I think, maybe Monday and another on Sunday from Luton and me Wednesday) is if we are told to by the authorities. My people in Malta can't wait to see us."
"If UK faces exponential growth in cases, flights will also probably be banned and if you're already in Malta you'll be stuck here with the rest of us. And then that'll be one hell of an expensive holiday. But never mind thatEdited: 5:05 am, March 12, 2020 "
If screening is foolproof we wouldn't have any cases as we've been screening for a while.
"Can think of worse places to be stranded in must say..... :-) That apart Britain always rescues its citizens in times of need so I'll get back at some pointBut this is getting personal now so I'm out of this conversation .Wish you all, all the best .I'll be back when it dies down (with a trip report!)"
"Wow,has it quietened down a bit now!?Just to pick up on a point by Eileen U in(I think) post #118 about possible catching the virus off somebody on the flight,can't disagree with that sadly if you stay back home you could just as easily catch it nipping to your local supermarket just up the road.Also I saw an item on the news on Saturday where a British woman living in Italy was asked about life under curfew over there & she said that bars & restaurants were open as usual,if that is true it seems rather strange IMO."
Stick to reading government advice and then make your own judgement is what I believe. It's a fact that things have escalated significantly in the last two or three days. Insurers will do all they can to avoid a pay-out and a flight cancellation by the airline however disappointing does mean a refund.
"I have been watching this post with interest, as we had booked a weeks holiday for the end of March. First time to Malta, and up until a couple of weeks back, was very excited and looking forward to our first visit to the island.TheStath - I think you have hijacked this post with your personal opinions - and your arrogance at 'I am not bottling out of this' astounds me. We had held off on making a decision about our trip until now. But with things changing almost hourly, have regrettably decided to cancel. We have not 'bottled it' - we have made an intelligent decision, based on the facts as they stand at the moment. As an earlier post said - Malta is a very small island and will not manage more than a couple of dozen cases in their hospital. To risk infecting others just so you can have your holiday is extremely self centred and selfish at this time.We are all in this together. I wish the people of Malta all the very best. And we will get our trip - when we can enjoy it and it is safe to do so, not only for us, but for the people of the island."
"Aldnafel yes bars, restaurants were open the Italian government shut them all down earlier today only banks, post offices, pharmacies and supermarkets allowed to open now, trumps done something similar in US also as well as all flights to and from China, Korea (these being in place a while) and now rest of Europe apart from UK and Ireland.Eileen"
"Ah brexit Staff now I was peed off actually and dumbfounded about how some people were, I'm over it now tho, I'm not panicking over the corona virus tho, just as I didn't over swine, bird flu, or ebola or cjd thing either still ate beef during that. Lol.Airlines are cancelling flights now the EU have lifted restrictions so just keep an eye on it like I said. Eileen"
"Holiday such a shame you've cancelled but at the end of the day you have to do what you think is best, especially if you or your partner have any medical conditions.Hopefully in a few months it'll all of died down and you'll get your much anticipated holiday. Eileen"
"Mt at least 3 of your cases were picked up by the screening, the Italian father and daughter certainly were read that in the times of Malta.But yes its not 100% foolproof nothing is, after all if people catch it just before they fly or on the plane there still in incubation period so may not of started with the virus it can take up too 14 days for symptoms to appear.Eileen"
"Caccicco I'm sorry to hear your in lock down in Italy, I hope you snd anyone your with is OK, can't be nice, especially now as they've closed all bars, restaurants etc also.Eileen"
I can tell you people that the staff in the Mater Dei hospital are first class one the occasion I ended up there one of them gave me her lunch as I was in icu all day.Had a look at the webcams and would rather be knocking around Sliema than Dublin at the moment.
"'To risk infecting others just so you can have your holiday is extremely self centred and selfish at this time.'Can't help feeling that this piece of logic is attacking the problem from the wrong point of view really,for most 'honest' people infecting others isn't something that is going to enter their heads IMO,they are more likely to be worried about being infected,I would like to think that most honest people would stay at hyome if they though they had any chance of infecting anyone else,sadly not all people are honest you are likely to get some travelling even when they feel/know they shouldn't.Also many people look forward so much to a break from work,especially this time in the year when it is somewhere warm away from the UK Winter,especially(as I well know) how you may have had to fight tooth *& nail to get the time off work!As for Trump,nice to know that the UK & Ireland are 'safe',how on Earth can you come to that conclusion?!?Finally glad to see Brexit hasn't been forgotten,just waiting for some idiot to say this wouldn't have happened if we'd voted Remain!Edited: 7:25 am, March 12, 2020 "
In regards the Lockdown situation and potentially getting stranded. If what has happened in Italy is anything to go by then this would be very unlikely to happen.Even after the Lockdown was imposed on Sunday airlines still continued to fly in and out and I believe some flights are still operating as ‘rescue’ flights to bring foreign nationals out.I was speaking to someone from Germany on the Venice forum yesterday who flew out of Venice that morning to Frankfurt.I would have thought should Malta go to a lockdown situation that they would encourage anyone who doesn’t live in the country to leave so’s not to overburden their health system.So I doubt very much anyone will be stranded but the may have to pay an additional charge to book a new flight.
"Malta has cancelled flights to and from certain countries so you wouldn't be able to book an alternative flight, you'd have to see with the authorities on how to get back home. Cases have once again risen, we are now at 9."
"So I definitely won't be sitting on my flight to Malta today. Slovakia is closing down all airports as of tomorrow, which means I wouldn't be able to come back from Malta on Sunday. Such a shame. 200 euros went down the drain."
"Kleptiko if your government has shut down airports, will your travel insurance not cover you for a refund, I know it would in the UK, not sure about your country tho.Eileen"
"Mt oh dear that's not good, saying that 9 is better than over 400 like us, but then 400 is better than poor Italy, not that any of it is good.Eileen"
"Battling Boris will keep everything open here in the UK we refuse to bend in the face of a global pandemic. carry on as normal! No virus will effect the brave Boris bulldog spirit of dunkirk. No bug will get past the british blue passport and Red phone box. WTO rules. Maggie etc""My final word (especially for Eileen who I just know is a full on Boris fan!)PS sorry you missed your holiday K :-(…...I'd have just gone myself and crossed the bridge of return and problems thereof after spending a grand old week smashing it up in Paceville…coz if you believe some of the doom and gloom merchants in the world today, make the most of life as you may not be around long!Edited: 11:12 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Wrappido yes Malta looks lovely compared to Burnley also, The matrei dei staff are great, still dosent alter the fact tho it's not equipped to deal with more than 30 cases at once, nothing to do with how good the staff are, it's to do with icu and isolation beds and equipment.Eileen"
"This is being talked about currently :https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/docto…Might be something to be aware of, if planning travels.Watch the news and Malta Government info:https:/…Novel-coronavirus.aspx"
"What good would that do? Yeah great cock up the economy , shut down countries for weeks on end. Then when you eventually re-open the borders there will be a massive surge then. Delaying the inevitable or kicking the can down the road.The fact is Pandora's Box is wide open, the barn door is swinging in the wind and Trigger is disappearing over the horizon.I personally think that we should just ride this one out. Adopt a business as usual approach. Statistics show that among those that contract this virus, the mortality rate is about 1%. Its an inconvenience really , it's been massively sensationalised.But they must do what they must do after all they (those that are in power) are supposed to be the intelligent ones aren't they?, but a worldwide recession looms on the back of this? Hardship for billions? The death toll from this would arguably higher in the long term.Is this really a price worth paying? I don't think so. I personally don't think there will be a shut down in UK, Malta or anywhere else soon, and the simple reason they had one in Italy as that they have a very aged population."
"I had to cancel my whole trip To Malta from Australia even though there are no health warnings from either country but the problem is, that when arriving either there or home, they may bring in self quarantining. So that in itself is a problem especially for people going home to family members or needing to go back to work. I’m very disappointed but what can one do? I’m in the process of obtaining refunds for this that and the other and have been quite successful. The main problems for me are a refund from Airmalta and my Emirates flight from Australia"
"Well from yesterday Ireland is in lockdown all schools,churches cannot have over 100 people in it no sporting events as such St.Patrick will be turning in his grave as no parade.Some supermarkets ran out of bog rolls toilets to you posh people I mean have people never heard of newspapers like in the Blitz.Queues outside supermarkets after our great leader gave his big speech from Washington not Dublin he was over with his mate D.Trump who he did not shake his hand kissed his behind though.So now the ordinary people who drop their kids off at school and creche have to stay at home and mind them till the 29th or drop them into grandma and pa.If they closed the pubs well we might have an all out war or we can all go to Malta for some sun sea and."
"Well, nothing makes people panic like being told NOT to panic eh?Just heard Premier League may be cancelled until April. I have , for years wanted to celebrate Liverpool winning league raising a glass in Malta. First Steven Gerrard slip gives us a no-no. (I was in Murphy's). Last year we were pipped by a point and this year, there are 3 of us all descending on Malta and...A bloody BUG has scuppered our plans!"
"Eileen,talking about brain dead overheard two ladies on the bus this morning,one telling the other that she had been told that people have to avoid Chinese Restaurants,would have thought that one was obvious!!!As for checking the Times Of Malta I have been doing that & so far the biggest article on it is that the supposed government announcement of 35 new cases was FAKE NEWS,all anybody needs!Strath,don't worry,the big teams do let the little teams win the league now & then,like every 30 years!"
"World Champions, reigning European Champions and 25 points clear at the top, as it stands...YNWA (don't get me started!) what as or was a small thing that would blow over has, this week, made me act like a bloke that is the proud owner of a fork, in a world of soup!! Plus I am starting a new job any time after 24th March in a bookies. A sport lock down = nothing for folk to bet on so I'll be looking at FOT's! See there, me, the much derided Stath is living proof of the economic effect of this bloody bug! Plus...I heard that drinking Corona Lager can lead to infection too.... Just what I heard, like!"
"Hi guys, just wondering how the situation is in Malta - I've tried doing a bit of Google research and can see there's only a small amount of cases. I'm due to fly over on the 18th from the UK for a few nights but will it be a ghost town? Or is it business as usual? Thanks x"
"'I heard that drinking Corona Lager can lead to infection too.... Just what I heard, like!'Not if you suck it through the lime wedge,that purifies it I believe!"
https:/….XmtlKzyP48c.facebookIn response to your queries
All those who arrive to Malta from any country will have to go into mandatory self-quarantine as per newest updates by the PM
"Xaghra and there probably correct look at cheq Republic, Slovakia they've closed all borders no foreign nationals allowed in unless residents, no one allowed out, Greece has cancelled the Olympic torch event, and closing borders also, Malta has banned travel to and from some countries tho unlike the UK Boris the gimp is letting anybody in.Eileen"
"Kangraoom I presume its not a direct flight, you will have a connection if its in one of the European cities or countries who have closed there borders then you should be entitled to a refund I would think, however you mentioned Emirates so chances are it's dubai or Abu Dhabi, and if so then they won't have to refund you as there not in lock down, unfortunately I doubt your insurance will cover it either as its you who have cancelled, if Malta had closed its borders then they might of, or if Australia had said not too travel to Malta they might off also,But it said on UK news today insurers were starting to refuse to pay out, and were meeting with omsbunman to change rules ie epidemics or pandemics won't be insured anymore. Eileen"
"Wrappido Boris is basically doing nout ere,Mind you the FA and other sporting associations have most cancelled until at least early April, big events like MCM etc being cancelled by the organisations, but hey you can still come to the UK Boris will let anyone in. Eileen"
You have to self quarantine yourself now.
"Mt not surprising that really is it, are they still screening tho at the airport, hopefully they are.Eileen"
"Lynsaya yes, most other countries are saying similar, have you seen the news in the UK anyone with a persistent unusual cough or high temperature have to self quarantine for 7 days, funny that every other country its 14 days, maybe Boris thinks because we're British the incubation period is less, the ruddy chump he is.Eileen"
Someone on the Seabank Hotel review/questions has just had e mail from hotel that says as of Monday people who arrive at the hotel have to self isolate for 14 days. If they break this rule they will be fined €1000 each time they break isolation. Will this be all hotels I wonder?
"Yes, all hotels. All arrivals in Malta, regardless of origin must self-isolate. Fines are €1,000.00 per day.Read this:https:/…Novel-coronavirus.aspx"
"So no point anyone going then is there, and what about if there only booked for a week, can't isolate for 14 days then can they, they may as well just shut there borders then, people aren't going to go to go and sit in a hotel room for 2 weeks they'll just cancel, they'll have to cut there losses tho as insurance won't pay out as Malta hasn't closed borders, there just saying come, but you have to stay in your hotel room.Eileen"
"Air Malta has already had 1 state aid intervention. EU rules forbid another (unless current situation means EU relax the rules). I hope I am wrong, but I cannot see the airline surviving this virus.Edited: 1:18 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Agree, not worth going to spend your holiday in your hotel room. Best to cancel and go when it is all over , whenever that may be . Graham"
"So sad,we were so looking forward to our trip,isn't the situation is a bit awkward with regard to travel insurance if Malta don't actually close its borders to visitors?On the toilet roll issue,2 supermarkets today,Morrison's had loads,Sainsbury had none,strange,hadn't heard that being mentioned as one of the symptoms anyway!"
"Alsnafel if Malta closed its borders, your holiday company would have to offer, either a holiday somewhere else to same quality as the one you booked, or offer an alternative date ie later in year for the one you booked, or a refund, that's if you book through a travel agent, booking agents for hotel rooms do not have to refund, a lot are tho over this virus, my daughter was due to go to MCM comic con in Birmingham, MCM cancelled it the booking site she'd used when she contacted them refunded her, so did train line for her train tickets, so a lot are refunding as good will gestures.However hotels booked direct in Malta don't seem to be offering the same courtesy seen a couple of posts people saying they lost money when tried to get a refund. Airlines I've heard a lot in the UK have either let people transfer booking to later, some have even refunded, travel insurance it was on news had stopped refunding over the virus. Eileen"
"Paul yes it'd be a shame, still dosent alter the fact tho, the Maltese government have made it so people don't want to go as will be confined to there hotels, as Air Malta is practically state owned then these people should be refunded, I know it's no ones fault, and there trying to contain the virus, but it isn't tourists fault either, a lot of Maltas cases are residents, albeit some are Italians but still residents as they live there, most tourists probably can't afford too loose the money its cost, and won't be able to afford to rebook unless they get a refund, especially as most insurance won't cover it now especially as its being declared officaly as a pandemic.I'm not saying it's anyone's fault it's not, but there's got to be a line for fairness over tourists loosing money. Eileen"
"Hi I arrived at dB seabank yesterday (13th March) Initially I was told that if i checked in i would have be quarantined in my room for 14 days but my trip is a 5 night stay given to me as a gift for my 50thOr I would need to fly straight back. No transfer back available and flight prices suddenly went up between 300-1700 euros. I flew in from uk.Then after nearly 2 hours of waiting outside hotel and frantically trying to find flights which would have been on 14th at night so time would have been spent at the airport....we were suddenly allowed to check in if our flight arrived into Malta before 1pm. I had landed around 12.15 local time.I can’t relax at all and wonder what the situation will be like in the next few days. They only have one restaurant open...Honestly I wouldn’t advise anyone to travel if they can avoid itEdited: 2:02 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I consider its not until you are here that you appreciate the impact, perhaps something yet to be seen in UK. I've read lots from folk saying the virus will not stop them from plans but the stark reality is it will not feel much like a holiday once you're here.Just to be clear, Malta has not closed fully its borders. Arrivals need to quarantine."
"We have a package deal with Jet2 for the flights,hotel & transfers,at the moment their website is showing that they will comply with all UK government guidelines which,or course,as yet don't advise against travel to Malta,I don't see how they can go ahead with the flights under the circumstances,maybe Jet2 have other ideas.Not panicking as yet as our departure date is a week away & I guess they have people with earlier departures to deal with.As for travel insurance,we had a similar experience with the volcano ash cloud,insurance companies stopped paying out for it but luckily we had purchased ours before that clause was added & got paid out,fingers crossed!"
New information. As from yesterday any passengers flying to Malta will have to undergo a 14 day quarantine. Any breech of the quarantine will result in a 1k fee per day. Spot checks will be held by the police to ensure that people will comply to the new travel rules.

"The passengers who arrived in Malta today were informed of the new regulations. It is a necessary measure taken by the country. Only flights from Italy, Spain, Switzerland, France and Germany have been banned for now, though many are demanding that UK flights be halted too. Travellers are free to come on a flight from the countries which haven't been banned, but will have to adhere to the new quarantine rules."
Really not worth going at the moment. Graham
"I work in the hospitality field in Malta and we had to close the business down for the time being (without salary). My son is also currently stuck in Germany so it's not easy for me either. We love tourists and we're sorry for this situation. As Mark said, it's a necessary measure at the moment. We really look forward to having you guys here in Malta once all this is over."
New information regarding the quarantine belowhttps://www.visitmalta.com/en/covid-19
"With the latest rules in place, has anyone had any luck with refunds regarding their flight or accommodation?I have my holidays booked in May. I do not have a package deal of any sort. I have booked my flight and accommodation separately. Curious how are people going about cancelling now? And how successful are you?Also, anyone with plans in the future, are you holding off? Cancelling?"
"Too early to say what will happen in May, if you can cancel and get full refunds (which I don't think will be offered this early) decide whether you want to go or not, if not wait and see what happens nearer the time, if you choose to cancel now you would not get your money back."
Was queuing for the Gozo ferry this morning & someone became ill. They had to take everyone off the ferry.We just got on the 1st bus out from there
We were lucky (as we had paid in full) - due to be in Malta 17-28 March - our hotel very kindly agreed to defer our dates until September (the next time we could make it).
I had an apartment booked with TA for a week on March 29. I phoned this morning and they cancelled and refunded without any problem. Don’t know about flights yet. I’ll hold off and see what happens.
"I also want to say that I have followed this post with interest for some time. Many people in our community here have read certain replies made in this post in horrified silence, especially certain comments made by someone called The Strait. It is not OK to personally attack those who are just trying to tell you what the situation is here. There is no reason for panic at all, but this isn't a joke. The way you reply here says everything about what kind of a person you truly are. Please be mindful and respectful."
"For people who arrived in Malta, before the 13th March, say they are staying for 3 weeks. What happens to them? Are they in quarantine?"
Not only sad for people who have had their holidays spoilt but also sad for Malta`s tourist industry which is a major part of the countries economy. Let us hope it doesn`t last too long. Graham
"Thanks @MarkB. That was very nicely put. I was struggling with how to address kindly the persons who were poking fun at the situation in this post to be honest...though I do understand that it's not an easy situation for those who were looking forward to their holiday. Thanks for your kind comments to the families of those affected by the virus, and I'm sorry that this happened on your holiday @femaleexplorer. I hope that everything turned out fine once you caught the bus @stockport1965."
"We was flying 27th March with Ryanair. At the moment flights departing in March they are letting you transfer to another date with no fee, if the flight is dearer you have to pay the difference. We had free cancellation on the hotel. We will come and visit your beautiful country March 2021 now. Best wishes everyone."
"We were booked for 24 March for a week. The Airbnb place we'd paid for in full could not have been more understanding, and have given us a full refund. Are just waiting to see what will happen with our Easyjet flights.We will get to see Malta when all this is over - & will book this same Airbnb to stay at.We are all in this together and our thoughts are with all those in the tourist industry in Malta that will be so effected by all this."
"This was in the news (online) as early as Thursday evening it was a possibility, then it happened, what I don't get is why the hell are Airlines or travel companies not informing people before they go, its awful people are arriving for 3,5 nights finding out about it when they get too the hotel, are having too either pay for 14 nights dinner, bed, breakfast to be confined to a hotel room, or having too pay for a taxi to airport, then a flight back to the UK, and having to stay in the airport for hours or until the next day, airlines should just stop flying people in, or in the very least give people the choice before they get onto the plane.Then there's the maltese tourist industry which is going too take one hell of a battering, due to this, people will cancel, and because this has happened over half will not rebook Malta for a later stage as they'll be put off with how all this was handled. I'm not due to go until September, hopefully it'll all be over by then, if it isn't I'll simply cancel, rebook when it is all over. You've got to feel for the tourists stranded quarantined, had there hard earned holidays ruined, the Maltese who tourist industry is going to take one hell of a battering, may take a long time to recover, which obviously will affect there economy as the tourist industry is one of if not the main economy.Then of course there's all the victims of this virus worldwide and there families, the people who have it, the people who died there's over 1100 cases in the UK now over 20 deaths, Malta has it cases also, everywhere has its terrible, horrible for everyone, more and more countries are going into lock down, more a saying there going to close there borders and not allow any foreigners in, or anyone out who's allready in, anyone who says now it's only virus, and it won't stop them going on holiday are idiots to put it bluntly, I'm suprised Malta hasn't added the UK to its list of flights banned to be honest with the way it's esculated here in the last couple of days. My thoughts are with all who has this virus or have died and there families also. EileenEdited: 2:44 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Well stated Eileen. Graham
"I agree with Eileen that airlines seemed slow to react,I guess I would be inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt in that they had something unfolding that was bigger than they had experienced before.The whole experience has been hard for so many in different ways,for us choosing somewhere for my birthday this year had been a difficult choice for various reasons,to see if all blow up in front of us days after our plans for March 2021 had also gone pear shaped was so frustrating,but ours was a small inconvenience compared to those who have suffered physically,it seems we will get a full refund.Good luck to everybody affected,hope you all get sorted as painlessly as possible"
Keep the flag flying YNWA.
"Just had my holiday cancelled by mercury holidays they gave me 48hrs notice and a full refund. I will book a later holiday, the stath may even join me."
Good to hear that people are getting refunds. Graham
"'I was struggling with how to address kindly the persons who were poking fun at the situation in this post to be honest...though I do understand that it's not an easy situation for those who were looking forward to their holiday.'We all deal differently with different situations,this has been such a fast moving situation & affectedly different people in different ways,I personally would always rather laugh than cry,it makes me feel that much better even though at times it isn't easy!Closing in on 70 way too fast but still feeling 30(well apart from the arthiritis!),I can remember my first trip to the USA in 1980,40 years ago & it seems like 5 minutes,given that whatever time I have left is going to be the same,after working for 50 years I am going to enjoy it!Eileen,I see your friend across 'The Pond' has decided to ban flights from the UK & Ireland as from Tuesday,wonder what they know about the next 48 hours!"
We've booked to travel on the 11th of April as a family of 4. Heard nothing from Loveholidays about the hotel and nothing from easyjet other than the fact it's free to change the flights. Has anyone had any experience with Loveholidays refunding?
"@Hols I'm also flying to Malta at that time (good Friday). I'm an independent traveller, Ryanair. No hotel booked. No word from Ryanair regarding the now updated FCO advisory (against all but essential travel) - however I'm guessing it's just too early for them to make any move yet. We don't know and they don't know how long that advisory will be in place for, or how long Malta will effectively be in lockdown. I'm hoping for a cancellation on the part of Ryanair, just know I'll probably have to wait a while yet!"
Ryanair will likely cancel much nearer the time.
"Steve, what's Steve (Stath) doing about his, as he'll of booked his all independently won't he.He's being rather quiet last day or so. Eileen"
"Hols no expierence first hand, but a friend of mine was due to go Mexico with them at the height of the swine flu in 2009,she ended up having to ring them, they did refund in the end but it took about 2 to 3 weeks and several calls until they did.Eileen"
"Jk Ryan Air are still operating half there flights to Spain and its in lock down, with a curfew of 6pm,so good luck with getting them to cancel flights to Malta who are only isolating tourists at the moment.Eileen"
If your travelling against the FCO’s advice then your Insurance will not be valid..Philipa
Thanks all
"@Eileen U the FCO advice has changed, to against all but essential travel to Malta, as at 14/03. Just waiting for Ryanair to catch up on that."
"Eileen,can't wait for the Orange one to have a Dope test,bound to test positive for that,take care & stay safe!"
"Jk that's good, you should get refunded now then.Eileen"
"He's tested negative for covid 19,but yep he'd test positive for a dope test. Lol. Take care yourself alsnafell.Eileen"
Just to liven up the thread.Anyone so far had any luck with cancellations for May?
"No, my boss due to go in May, jet2 told her there dealing with it month by month, so probably won't hear anything till April, as most probably doing the same."
"If you mean hotels, I have successfully cancelled four bookings. Three through booking.com and one which was fully paid. Refund went through to my credit card the next day. Yet to follow up with flights on Alitalia for May and June"
"I booked flights and hotel separately, DB seabank, for 5 nights through Love Holidays they are refusing to refund will only offer me a credit note, this year 5 nights are 499.90, next year same time 5 nights are 835, what a rip off"
"I'd say hold Fort for cancelling, as Johnson told all hotels, booking agents etc they had to refund money if people could go to the covid19 when he first closed hotels, bars, shops etc, so you may find if this goes on much longer very likely he may say something similar for future bookings, you can't go as things stand at the moment as all flights are suspended, and the ferry from sicily to Malta also is, so I'd leave it too see if any more announcements made, my guess if the no travel ban except for essential travel out of this country continues they have no choice but to refund you, where are they based if in UK they will be Abta Ana Atol protected so they will have to refund you, however if there registered in another country it will depend on that countries laws, however I suggest you contact the European consumer organisation they will be able to tell you if your entitled to a refund whichever country loveholidays is based in, and will very likely help you get one, they did with me with easyjet in 2014 when I was sold a holiday that wasn't what they portrayed the hotel as, and when I complained while in resort refused to move me, or refund, the European consumer org took easyjet on for me, and I got the hotel refunded, and the cost of food that we had to eat out for as the food was so terrible in the hotel, they had half the hotel with food poisoning and a writ off the environmental health and tourist board giving them 3 months to improve, I presume they must of as its still open."
Had my holiday cancelled by mercury holidays and they say 30 days for refund. Payments vanished off of my booking and we have'nt even had an email to say it's being refunded. disgusted.
"I read that refunds could take 3 weeks to be processed,in the end our refund from Jet2 was paid but in a strange way.After receiving an email showing the total to be refunded we first had a refund coinciding with the extra amount paid for seats & meals,a couple of days later another which matched payment for deposits & a few days later the balance.At the end of the day these companies are dealing with huge numbers of refunds & are probably all struggling to cope,hopefully we will all be sorted eventually."
"thank you, will find out what country love holidays are registered in"
"Loveholidays are a UK registered company and both ATOL and ABTA registered. The number of claims will inevitably cause delays in processing refunds, but there is, at some point, going to be a situation where cashflow becomes a real problem for some travel companies."
A lot of them will start giving out vouchers like Aer Lingus over here they keep your money and you can travel eventually not always convenient especially if you have paid out for a family holiday.
I was contacted by Malta Air today that my May 13 flight is cancelled and they are offering a refund. I'm very grateful for the refund from Malta and Norwegian as U.S. airlines are using force manjure and trying to avoid refunds. I will visit in the future. Hope everyone reading this is healthy.
"My niece and her friend were booked through loveholidays for their 1st holiday abroad, which they'd booked themselves, and have had to take a hit of around £200 each as the flight with Ryanair has a 100% cancellation fee & loveholidays take £75 fee but as the hotel and transfers were still offering a free cancellation I told them to cancel rather than pay out another £300 each, as their balance was due, and maybe get no refund or a voucher."
"They should of waited until Ryan Air cancelled the flights, which they no doubt will as travelling abroad at the moment is against government advice, if the carrier cancels they have to give a refund, as your relative cancelled they do not."
"The problem was they were going to have to shell out the extra £300 each, and then try to somehow get it back from 2 of the companies I avoid booking with! I have a package booked with Tui travelling earlier than them, and although they cancelled it 2 weeks ago I have had no email, no correspondence and no refund yet, as I think they're waiting for the Govt to change the rules that ABTA are trying to push through, so they get 4 months to pay a refund or you get a voucher which is valid 2 years and only get a refund if it's not used by then. So their £200 loss just looked like a much better bet for their situation."
"Hi Were in uk and have holiday end of may , as far as I know we still cant travel :(( Lisa n Dave"
"the FCO advises British nationals against all but essential international travel.I imagine even if you could go, you would have to be in quarantineEdited: 3:35 am, April 27, 2020 "
"Right I've being looking into all this a lot more, nearly every country in the world has banned entry to UK or EU nationals,The only flights operating from Malta are air Malta to London Heathrow, no other flights are allowed to land unless they are rescue flights by the Maltese government for there nationals, or rescue flights of other countries for there nationals, so there for under Abta and the law at the moment airlines have to offer a full refund or a booking for another flight suitable to both parties, However Abta are trying to get the law changed so Vouchers valid for 2 years only have to be offered, so far this has not being legislated, but airlines are still trying to get away with it, to me if your lanning on going on a trip once this is all over then there's no reason why the voucher or a re booked flight can not be taken, however understandbly people may need the money back at this moment in time, basically under law at the moment you are entitled to your money back or a flight at a future date, airlines can not fly to Malta unless they are rescue flights, and even now this has more or less stopped, so underlaw they are not able to fulfill there contract to you, so have to reimburse or offer alternative flights for the future."
Malta's airport is closed and will probably be one of the last services to reopen.https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2020…
