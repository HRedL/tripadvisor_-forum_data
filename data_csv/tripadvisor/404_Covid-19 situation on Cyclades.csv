"HelloWe have a reservation for 1 week Folegandros trip from 6th of September. My wife scares generally about the COVID-19 situation, therefore I ask for information about COVID-19 on Cyclades. Is there any websites with actual numbers of COVID-19 on Cyclades islands? We are travelling from Rhodes over Amorgos to Folegandros. As I know Folegandros and some Cyclades islands are Covid free. We travel from Amorgos to Folegandros with Seajets on Sunday. Is there any information about covid measures on Seajets small speed boats Seajets2 and Superjet. Is there probably any other connection between Amorgos and Folegandros on Sunday?Kind regardsAles"
AlesThe situation today will not be the same as the situation in September. More tourists over the summer could lead to a higher number of cases coming into Greece. The figures now wonâ€™t help you decide what to do in September.
For covid measures on sea jets you can contact them directly. https://www.seajets.gr/contact
"The Greek ferries are only allowed to sell 60% of their capacity (65% on ferries with cabins). You will always have an empty seat on your side. Wearing a face mask is mandatory on all public transport (buses, trains, taxis, ferries) and in several indoor areas, like shops, bakeries and pharmacies. Travellers are randomly tested upon arrival to Greece (from some countries all passengers are tested). You have to fill in a PLF (passenger location form) before arrival til Greece. In my mind the Greek measures are better than in most other European countries. There were a few Covid cases in the Cyclades, less than 5, in April/May. No deaths are reported.Edited: 11:56 am, August 01, 2020 "
Figures can be totally different in 5-6 weeks from now.From Amorgos to Folegandros there is only the Seajet2 on Sundays.
