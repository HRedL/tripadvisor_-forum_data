Chicago will rely largely on signs along highways and at airports as it orders self-quarantine for people who visit states where COVID-19 is surging.https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…

"Not surprised over half the posts on this thread got whacked. Maybe they'll come back.While I agree with the sentiment and idea behind a quarantine, for the safety / protection of residents, enforcement is next to impossible for a state in the middle of the country. Hawaii (and New Zealand and Australia for that matter) have the clear advantage that anyone visiting there will, in all likelihood, be arriving at an airport. Much easier to control a few points of entry (airports) vs. countless ways into Illinois / Chicago.The holiday weekend will be interesting...(wonder how long this post will survive, too)."

Chi-Dav... ALL of the deleted postS came from BartlettDan. All of them.

8 coronavirus deaths and 2 murders yesterday. Try again.
"If you live in one of the states requiring quarantine and are just doing a plane transfer in Ohare is that OK?? Flight from Tampa, FLto Battlecreek, Michigan with 3 hour layover in Ohare?? (My cousin is visiting his brother who live in Battlecreek and just booked a flight with a layover in Ohare. I'm joining him for the visit too.If you are flying into Ohare and then taking a bus to Indiana is that allowed? My brother who lives in Idaho (one of the states on the list) is planning to visit my dad in Indiana. If he can't take the bus, can he rent a car to get to Indiana??Thanks so much. I have been doing internet searches, but have not found answers and appreciate any clarification."
You don't have to quarantine if you are only passing through.
"Thanks msmejkal, I just saw that information too: ""The Order does not apply to any individual passing through designated states for less than 24 hours in the course of travel.""That's a relief. My cousin and I just booked non-refundable airline travel last week thru Ohare, and I was just wondering if that was a big mistake, as we could have just as easily booked travel thru Detroit Metro."
"Personally, I’d rent a car vs taking a bus from ORD to Indiana."
"Thanks Dave148, I agree. (A rental car would be a break from masks, better social distancing, faster, and not all that much more expensive, especially since two are traveling from Idaho). Thanks for your opinion on that. I will suggest that to my brother on his upcoming visit."
This is such a bummer. I had booked airline and hotel accommodations mid July coming From GA. This would have been first time traveling to Chicago. Does anyone know when it will be lifted? Too soon to say?
"Poster no. 25, according to the article linked in the original post (https:/…), states were placed on the list if they were reporting 15 new cases per 100,000 persons on a 7-day rolling average. Presumably, to get off the list, the state needs to reduce its new cases below that level. As Georgia’s new cases are still trending up, it presumably will be awhile before it gets under that figure."
"Why would anyone be traveling this year? Come in 2021 IF Georgia gets its pandemic in order and is taken off the list and/or IF there is a vaccine.Edited: 12:15 am, July 06, 2020 "

"@tross. Welcome to TA. If you had come here to plan a July visit, we could have warned you not to come to Chicago this year. The city is just beginning to open for Chicagoans but is not ready for visitors. In planning your trip next year please get back to us next year. There is usually a sticky in Top Questions titled “dates to avoid” that gives advanced notice of events that cause the city to fill with people and cause prices to skyrocket. Right now that sticky is empty because all dates are stay away dates. Never buy plane or train tickets before you get a hotel room.Edited: 12:18 pm, July 06, 2020 "
I agree. Thanks for commenting
""" I understand the sentiment, but this isn’t East Berlin so it would be impossible to track.""My cousin works for TSA he says they do a background check on everyone from every airline. They can easily find out if you have traveled within the time frame and put you on the do not fly list."
Breaking Chicago’s quarantine is not going to result in being put on a Do Not Fly list.
"That, Jordan's is BS"
"Besides, Jordan, the quarantine doesn't forbid travelers from the 15 states from arriving at ORD (or MDW). It merely forbids them from staying overnight in Chicago. Travelers who arrive at the Chicago airports are not in violation of the quarantine if they are changing planes, if they are traveling through to another state, or even if they are traveling to other parts of Illinois, aside from Chicago."
"""That, Jordan's is BS""You can try it and let me know if what he says is accurate or not. I have no idea, but that is what he told us."
"The quarantine is a Chicago rule not a federal one. And it has nothing to do with the airlines. Ask your cousin how many people from NY, NJ and Connecticut were put on a do not fly list because they flew to Florida. Or how many have been put on a list for flying to Hawaii."
Please don’t feed jb.
"Chicago's list of states which require arriving persons to quarantine is supposed to be reviewed and updated each Tuesday. NY State just revised its list and now includes 19 states, including Iowa (!) NY's list criteria are different from Chicago's: 10% positivity rate or 10 perons per 100K population.Edited: 8:25 am, July 14, 2020 "
Iowa has been on their list for awhile. They are requiring arriving travelers now to fill out a form with their place of contact.
NY has now added Wisconsin to their list. Go read some of the other forums. The amount of people taking and planning vacations is staggering.
"Beginning Friday, the order will now include Iowa and Oklahoma."
"Just following up on Dave 148's post no. 41: The mayor also indicated that they are following the numbers in Wisconsin as well, and it may be added to the list if the number of cases there continue to rise. Here is the Tribune article, https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
I'm trying to figure out if I can go from Iowa to ORD still for an outbound flight? Does the quarantine only apply to people staying in Chicago?
"Are you staying in Chicago or taking another flight out? And which day?If you are driving you can drive from Iowa straight to ORD and fly out.Edited: 9:08 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"I'm driving straight there (it's a morning flight, so I was originally going to spend the night before, but I think I'll probably just have to get up super early and drive instead. No biggie) Thank you!"
Spend the night before your flight in Rosemont. It’s just outside of O’hare. No need to quarantine. Many of the hotels have a park sleep fly package.
"Agree with #46.Rosemont is a suburb so no need to quarantine. And it doesn't start until Friday.Edited: 11:52 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"""Please don’t feed jb.""Don't feed my cousin that is what he told me. Unless you work for TSA how would you know? He does."
Visitors to Cook County Suburbs from COVID-19 Hot Spots to Quarantine for 2 Weeks = https://news.wttw.com/2020/07/17/visitors-co…
I am not disputing that. I am saying someone who works for TSA said that airlines can verify if you have traveled from a hot spot and if you have they can put some limits on you. If the airlines couldn't do that how would anyone know if you have followed the 14 day procedures?
"Hawaii has had a quarantine for a long time now. Florida, Montana, New York, New Jersey, off the top of my head, are other states that have had quarantined in effect, either now or earlier in the pandemic. Yet there has not been one report of anyone being placed on a no-fly list, or denied boarding, and I am sure thousands have not complied. Airlines may have the records to be aware, but there is no authorization for them to take any action."

#45 Rosemont is now under the 14 day quarantine rule.
The new suburban cook county one is actually just a guidance. It’s not mandatory. It’s confusing the way the news sites are reporting it. The Chicago one is mandatory with fines for violating it.
https:/…
Kansas has been added to the Chicago list of States requiring a 14 day-quarantine.
"Wisconsin has been added to Chicago's quarantine list, https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…Not sure how this is supposed to apply to folks who live over the state line in WI and commute daily to Illinois for work. I would assume they fall into the category of persons for whom “self-quarantine is not possible, practicable or advisable"" -- at least if their job cannot be performed remotely."
"If you spend more than 24 hours in WI you have to quarantine for 14 days. I highly doubt there's people living in WI and working in Chicago.Edited: 4:52 pm, July 27, 2020 "
My husband has a co-worker who lives in Racine and commutes daily to Chicago. I doubt that he is the only WI commuter -- although I know the train that he takes is far less occupied now than pre-pandemic.
I thought I read last week that J.B. said they would not apply it to people who live and work cross-border.
The order requires people who have spent more than 24 hours in high-risk states to self-quarantine for 14 days after entering Chicago. That wouldn’t apply to a daily commuter = IMO.
They'd pass the 24 hours on the weekend. Not like it matters because people are going to do whatever they want especially with going to WI.
"So I've read this entire thread (along with many other articles, etc) and from what I see, if we are traveling from Wisconsin, straight to Ohare, and fly out, we would not be in violation of the quarantine order, correct? The comment on page 4? 5? that says ""the order does not apply to any individuals passing through..."". Just not sure I am translating that statement correctly."
No need to quarantine if you drive from WI straight to Ohare.
"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Tuesday added Wisconsin, Missouri, North Dakota and Nebraska to the city’s self-quarantine list. People entering the city from those states are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. There are now 22 states on the self-quarantine list. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
https:/…Illinois has been added to New York’s list. People need to stop traveling and stay home!
"Regarding post #66, NJ and CT have generally been moving in lockstep with NY as to quarantined states. So, I presume that residents of those states, also, will be reluctant to travel to IL (as well as impeding IL residents' traveling to NJ and CT, as well as NY)."
"On the subject of Wisconsinites who commute to Chicago for work, the Tribune cites the City's Health Commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady, that ""commuters from Wisconsin who work in Chicago will be exempt from the strict quarantine rule, though they will be expected to only perform work tasks while in the city, and not go out shopping or socializing in public.""Here is a link to the entire Trib article, https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
"Well, better safe than sorry. Hard times require hard measures..."
Good to know because $90 round trip tickets from Houston were looking too good to be true. Staying put is the safest options for everyone.
Wisconsin is off the list = https:/…emergency-travel-order.html
"Just anecdotally, I have a young relative attending Syracuse University in New York. Being from Illinois, she must quarantine there. She had to fill out a form from the state listing her address and contact info, and was told there may be random checks. Even more importantly, her student id giving access cannot be activated until she has passed the 14 days."
The City announced today that Arizona and North Carolina were removed from Chicago's 14-day quarantine list; South Dakota was added. These changes take effect on Friday.
