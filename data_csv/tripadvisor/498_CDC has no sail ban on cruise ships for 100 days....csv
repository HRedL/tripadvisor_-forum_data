"Citing continued COVID-19 infections and deaths on cruise ships, federal health authorities are halting cruise operations in U.S. waters until the COVID-19 pandemic is over and requiring the industry to implement a plan to immediately mitigate outbreaks on ships.In a new “no-sail” order issued late Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the industry has not done a sufficient job to stop the spread of COVID-19 on its ships and is relying too much on U.S. resources to treat ill passengers and crew.The “no-sail” order will remain in effect for at least 100 days or until the Department of Health and Human Services lifts its COVID-19 public health emergency declaration.https:/…Edited: 6:07 pm, April 10, 2020 "
Would I be right to assume that this only covers the US?
Roj - CDC has no jurisdiction outside the US.
">>>Roj - CDC has no jurisdiction outside the US.<<<That's what I thought. I suppose they are just trying to formalise the obvious. I'm sure that they will be under pressure in the next 3 months to allow ships to sail again. But even if cruising in the US restarts again in less time, the lines will still have big issues that they will need to face up to. One of those is going to be a massive fall in confidence and demand amongst even some of those who have been cruising's biggest fans."
"There may be "" escape"" clauses from the 100 day mark. But when mentioned it does give the cruise lines a foreseeable futur (approx 3 month) when they might and probably be not allowed to sail."
maybe no immunity to this virus https://ca.news.yahoo.com/south-korea-report…
There should be a no SALE order along with the no SAIL order.
"Under the 100 day no sail order, would a cruise ship be allowed, by law, to travel from US waters to Europe, to proceed with their European sailings?"
KEV The bigger question is would the European ports allow them in Some Countries are still in the thick of it with the virus If the cruise line jump through all the hoops of the CDC/USCG they may be allowed to sail but that is a BIG if at the moment JMO
"Kev - yes. US rules have no jurisdiction in Europe. Obviously.The CDC/no sail rule only applies to US ports. Most lines have already sent their European season ships on over across the pond - carrying the crew on their way home. Whether there will be Med/European Sailings this season remains to be seen. Some lines have fully cancelled already, through to September and such, others are still hanging on to July starting dates - who knows!!"
I think the ships had to leave US waters by a certain date or they had to comply with the No Sail orders & all the rules to sail againhttps:/…index.html
":ht, I think the No sail applies to cruising. As long as they are not bringing passengers/cargo, they can leave. Whether they can re enter a port is another question."
"No Surf,I meant it on this aspect. "" I think the ships had to leave US waters by a certain date or they had to comply with the No Sail orders ""From what I understand it means that those anchored (at port or offshore) have to leave by a certain date or they can't leave anymore at all. But this is what I believe the No Sail order meant- they can still leave US waters, so long as they are not doing business- cargo or passengers.For example. SS bathtub leaves the Miami area and goes to Harvest Cay. For what reason I don't know. The question is can they come back, even without passengers or cargo. In short the ships themselves are not tied down past a certain date.So not a cruise to nowhere. Just no cruise. Reason I think so is that these ships currently are kinda well anchored/stationed now. No need to move them just to comply with the no sail order. If they are needed ( for example- a cruise from Bermuda to the carribeans- hey! just and example) they can move out of US waters and do business outside. Question is , if they have to come back, can they?"
BIGOnce they jump through the hoops CDC set up they can return to US posts
