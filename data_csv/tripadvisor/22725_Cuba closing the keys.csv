Just talking with a good friend. After Sunday they have been told the Keys will close for min 2 weeks.Just saying.
That falls in line with what we've heard. It will be a tough spring for the workers.
"Wouldn't be surprised to see most, if not all, the resort hotels to close throughout Cuba."
"HolaWell, if required, it could be a good set-up for quarantined areas, and for the Cubans to be able to make use of an empty resort or 2....with separate rooms, beds, food.... The location is certainly isolated enough.Hopefully it wouldn't come to that, of course.Cheers"
"Thanks for the info, the whole worlds closing."
"Post 4.Why the defeatest?Only 5 confirmed cases as of today.Far from closing to use hotels as quarantined ""hotel hospitals"""
"HolaLooking at the wrong person being a defeatist here, diva.....I haven't even cancelled my vacation yet, lol!Only making a comment - like many others do on this forum all the time.And I never mentioned ""hotel hospitals"". You did, lol!I am in the same group of those wanting to return here asap and hope it will be sooner rather than later. How fortunate that Cuba is the only country then, that doesn't have rapidly changing numbers of confirmed virus cases!CheersEdited: 5:12 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Yes I was using hospital hotels as you mentioned quarantine location perfect.
HolaPeople are being quarantined - or are being asked to self quarantine for a number of reasons. Doesn't mean they are sick or even will get sick. It is even being used as a preventative measure.No one jumping to any conclusions here.Cheers
Ok I'll bite ... what is the Keys ?
"Cayo Santa Maria in particular, is the one diva is referring to."
Cayo means keys ....
ahhhhhhh thank you
Cay or key is the English for cayo.Diva - is that just CSM or all the northern keys ?
"Beardo. I have only been told about csm.It is only closing due to lack of clients nothing mentioned as to virus.They have,so far , been told prepare for 2 weeks but could be longer ."
That's a lot of resorts and yes it is because of the virus Diva. Many more will follow... just saying.
"Larry.There is no virus there (yet).It is purely because there will be no clients.I have now been told they, those that need to be.will be going over to give the place a good going over."
"Thanks for not insulting me Diva :) I realize there's no virus threat yet (or is there) but it's the reason they're closing. Curious, will you be good and go over to see your friends if you can?"
"Larry .lot at your own back yard as to the insults you constantly type my way.If I do go it will be on my medical advice given to me.As my holiday is not based on the keys this post, a heads up to travelers, the hotels closing have little to no impact on me."
"7 confirmed cases now, where in Cuba ...not sure https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
Cuban National news last night also reported there were 2 new cases yesterday bringing the total to 7 so the public are being informed.However many things are in short supply. In Holguin city it's almost impossible to find any washing powder.
Over 10.000 rooms. That's a huge hit.
Post 23.There maybe over 10 thousand rooms but at no time are more than 60 % are occupied.Too many hotels and not enough people.
Over 6.000 rooms. That's a huge hit.
Yes it is. No matter how many are closed.But if Cuba says it has to happen it will.
"Sorry we won't be seeing you two in April. Like others, we haven't cancelled yet, just waiting for the best offer, but will cancel soon. No flights from here to there."
We are waiting. We will decide when we know what is the best for us.
This is not about Cuba but it may interest some people on TA and im sure Cuba will follow soon with a list of there own I saw this on another forum .https:/â€¦360044592594-Closures-Due-to-COVID-19
"I heard elsewhere that they are planning to close Santa Clara airport - I don't know if that is true.But with the flights from Italy stopped and those from Canada about to stop, there can't be many clients coming in anyway.I assume that occupancy was already dropping away."
"Hola #30Have not heard about the airport being closed, but for sure the hotels on csm are shutting down for how long....? got a text from a friend working on csm.All week I am getting texts saying do not come....cheers."
Varadero is also closing hotels down and workers told to stay home for quarantine .
Should also say the people going home they were told that it was not for weeks but months .
I expect that Canada will be closed for months.
"Hola #34if we are lucky, but that will be enough time to hurt a lot of people....the pay day to payday, when no payday for a few months, or say 6 months....ouch!"
