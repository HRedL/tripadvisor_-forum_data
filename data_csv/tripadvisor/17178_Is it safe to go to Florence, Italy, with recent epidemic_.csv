I have heard that there has been an epidemic of meningitis in Florence in June.Will it be safe for me to go there within the month??
First time that it has been mentioned on here so epidemic seems somewhat of an exaggeration although a google search indicates a few fatalities in Empoli earlier in the year.
"Yes, there were about 20 cases of Meningitis C reported in the Arezzo and Florence area. There may be more, but I have not heard. This is easy to avoid by being vaccinated, then no worries."
