Article breaks down whats happened so far on travelers who were refused entry or sent to isolation/quarantine. jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Total_51_peop…
I'd be curious to see what % of those turned away were turned away because of where they had visited recently and how many were turned away due to observed symptoms?
"Thanks for posting this. I travel in less than 4 weeks. Reading this I am a bit concerned that I may be turned back simply by virtue of having arrived from the US, where there have been outbreaks? I had not been concerned about that until reading this article."
"<< “concerned that I may be turned back simply by virtue of having arrived from the US” >>The day they turn back everyone arriving from the US is the day they effectively close the borders. If that needs to be done at some point, fine. But we’re nowhere near even being near that point yet. Given the size of the US, I’d suspect they would start with screening out people from specific areas if there were a major outbreak in the area.Edited: 7:35 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"We are supposed to fly out Saturday for Jamaica. If the coronavirus is in our state, is it even worth attempting? We have no fevers, but I don't want to get stuck in quarantine due to the fear factor. Any advice greatly appreciated."

"We are supposed to fly out on Monday from VA and from Boston. Traveling with 80+ grandfather and 6 yr old daughter. More concerned about quarantine than actually getting the virus. I wish I could be 100% sure that if we arrive with no symptoms, no fever, and from our locations that we'll be clear for entry. Regretting a little that we booked a stay at a resort, which isn't our usual type of accommodation. Will have to be vigilant. Sigh. What a mess."
You are over reacting just go and enjoy the time there.
"Did you fly out? If so, please can you share your experience at the airport. More worried about being stuck in quarantine than anything.We are scheduled to fly there at the end of March."
I wish everyone would realize that the flu is much more prevalent then the Coronavirus. So much of this is media hype and a scare factor. More people died in car accidents in the US over the weekend then all of the people in the US that have died with Coronavirus.
They said they were blocking entry of anyone who had been to China or Italy in the last month
"My concern isn't getting the coronavirus really, it's getting quaratined due to exposure (either in Jamaica or in the US or both). That and my 10yo that has asthma, I worry for him. And this isn't ""just the flu or a cold"" if you listen to the actual medical community discussing it.We are supposed to be flying to Jamaica Sunday. I have yet to book hotel, car, etc. Flights are refundable. We need to make a decision."
"Yes, I agree. I'm much more afraid of being quarantined - whether fairly or unfairly - than I am of the virus itself."
Was wondering any trouble virus related ? We are suppose to travel end of march but still trying to decide if we will
What’s the difference between fairly and unfairly quarantined? All quarantines are fair especially if it means keeping others safe. Don’t want to take the risk? Don’t travel.
"Wildcat, According the CDC, children don't seem to be as susceptible to Covid-19. and that there were limited reports of children with Covid-19/ And that the symptoms were mild, fever, runny nose, cough.But, if your child has asthma, then I think I would stay home and not travel right now. As for Covid-19 being similar to the flu, below is from John Hopkins and the CDC. (I do my research)Similarities: COVID-19 and the FluSymptomsBoth cause fever, cough, body aches, fatigue; sometimes vomiting and diarrhea.Can be mild or severe, even fatal in rare cases.Can result in pneumonia.TransmissionBoth can be spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking.A possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route (see details below under Differences).Flu can be spread by an infected person for several days before their symptoms appear, and COVID-19 is believed to be spread in the same manner, but we don’t yet know for sure.TreatmentNeither virus is treatable with antibiotics, which only work on bacterial infections.Both may be treated by addressing symptoms, such as reducing fever. Severe cases may require hospitalization and support such as mechanical ventilation.PreventionBoth may be prevented by frequent, thorough hand washing, coughing into the crook of your elbow, staying home when sick and limiting contact with people who are infected.Differences: COVID-19 and the FluCauseCOVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.Flu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.TransmissionWhile both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways (see the Similarities section above), there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.Antiviral MedicationsCOVID-19: Antiviral medications are currently being tested to see if they can address symptoms.Flu: Antiviral medications can address symptoms and sometimes shorten the duration of the illness.VaccineCOVID-19: No vaccine is available at this time, though it is in progress.Flu: A vaccine is available and effective to prevent some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity of the flu.InfectionsCOVID-19: Approximately 115,997 cases worldwide; 761 cases in the U.S. as of Mar. 10, 2020.Flu: Estimated 1 billion cases worldwide; 9.3 million to 45 million cases in the U.S. per year.DeathsCOVID-19: Approximately 4,087 deaths reported worldwide; 27 deaths in the U.S., as of Mar. 10, 2020.Flu: 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide; 12,000 to 61,000 deaths in the U.S. per year.The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly. Since this disease is caused by a new virus, people do not have immunity to it, and a vaccine may be many months away. Doctors and scientists are working on estimating the mortality rate of COVID-19, but at present, it is thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu."
"Your decision should be very simple, stay home. You have nothing to lose by cancelling the trip. Wait until things stabilize. Jamaica will always be there when the time is right. In this instance better safe than sorry!!"
"Iriestar,Japan tried to quarantine all the passengers on the cruise ship that was stuck outside Yokohama for several days with the result that the virus spread like wildfire. I don't think that those passengers who were infected considered that to be fair.However, I will take your succinct advice and cancel. You have made my mind up, and I'm grateful."
"We chose to cancel. That was our personal choice, due to what this could turn into over the course of a few days. Thankful we did.....not worth the stress."
"#17 sorry you had to cancel, but Jamaica will be here when your ready!"
"We were supposed to fly in on Sunday. We cancelled as well. We cancelled before Germany was announced as a travel restriction which would have kept us from traveling anyway as my husband flew through Germany late last week. We are planning to rebook for end of May and will reassess as we get closer to that date. The situation is too fluid for us to be comfortable, both for our own health, as well as the health of those we could possibly infect."
