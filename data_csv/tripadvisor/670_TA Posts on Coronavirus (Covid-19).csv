"Hello Travelers,Colleen from the Tripadvisor Content Team here! As of Monday 3/9/2020 Tripadvisor posted a global guide to the Coronavirius (Covid-19) off of it’s homepage. This guide is to serve as a place for general information on the outbreak and effects on travel from a global perspective (see page here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019 ). For TA to continue to provide the most up to date information for travelers, we are actively encouraging individuals to visit destination forum pages for more information for specific countries. We know that many destination forums already have threads discussing the implications of Covid-19, but I plan to pin new threads to each of the following Destination Forums today, which will reference any existing threads, the global guide, and a recommendation of content to discuss. This effort will be on-going, so the countries we are tackling today may change as we get more information on Covid-19. Additionally, we at TA are hoping to use this effort to shed light not only on the disruptions or closures in these cities, but also how to continue to support these local economies during this situation. Countries that will be posted in: China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Italy, IranIf you are a contributor in any of these locations, we would greatly appreciate any insights you could provide within the thread I post.Thank you so very much for your time and all of your contributions.ColleenTripadvisor Content Team"
"Hi Collen,Why didi you exclude Japan forum? It has already flood posts on Covid-19."
Colleen a nice idea.I think most of the Cvirus threads reamain near the top for Italy. A lot of useful information as to how it's unfolding particularly helping with those caught by the sudden closures and lock down.They are remaining relevant and not decending into chat or panic.Two are already pinned to the Italy ForumThe one on the Sicilly Forum could do with being pinned to the top of that forum as it covers an area that is Italian and is also having closures.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g244…
"Colleen, the orange travel notice banner isn't visible on mobile. Can you pass on the information?"
"You need to check the posts, some have nothing to do with Coronavirus, they mention the word though."
"@Ariel-Scarlett the alert is live on our Desktop & Mobile Web version of the Tripadvisor.com . The teams are working to get it onto the app as quickly as we can. Thank you for bringing this up!@ETflyer apologies for leaving Japan off the list above. We are planning to pin a topic on that forum as well. Appreciate your feedback here. Best,ColleenTripadvisor Content Team"
"Colleen,Thanks for your post.I had seen the Header Link, and added it to several threads, in forums, that I frequent.Hope that this can be updated with some regularity.Appreciated,Hunt"
I'm not seeing it on mobile site (not using the app). I wouldn't have even known about it if fellow posters hadn't mentioned it in another thread.
Airel-ScarlettI agree it is not showing on the mobile site as I also use it as I don't like the APP.Angie.
"I’m seeing on the mobile site, you have to go to the forum not this page. It is right at the top of the screen. I’m not using the App. Either.Edited: 1:01 pm, March 09, 2020 "
It is not showing on my iPhone at the top of any Destination forum or Beyond Destination forum page Angie.
I don’t use an iPhone.
"It was only visible after I'd logged out and cleared cookies. That and the new font/reply were visible when I logged back in. iPad Safari, full site."
"I don't see the orange banner at the top of my iPhone screen on any main Travel Forum page. Definitely not present when a thread is open, but I wouldn't expect that. I've checked many from Belgium to Australia to Canada to Vancouver."
"I'm using an Android phone, .com with Chrome."
"Mufti,So glad to hear you are having the same experience as myself with using an iPhone.Angie."
12-odd hours Angie and still no orange button in the main forum pages.
"Yep Mufti still nothing guess the engineers were/are playing with the font, and other changes on the TA pages which is now a bloody mess !!!Angie."
Strange some can see it and others can't. Same with that photo the other day. I agree the font now is worse.
"Angie, I am going to give it a week for the TA engineers to fiddle with the font size in the different sections of the page. I expect they ""rushed"" the forum posts change by end of business today as a favour to all of us. I don't think we have the final version at the mo. I could be wrong."
"The orange banner is still absent on mobile. The coronavirus threat might be over until it appears.Meanwhile, the hysteria on several forums has increased today... oy."
Learn more about Covid 2019. I thought it is Covid 19 not 2019
Actually it is COVID-19(all caps) That's the name of this coronavirus disease.https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it
"Yes it is COVID-19 but it seems no one is seeing this notice and if they are they are still posting endless new posts, it even seems to encourage some to post about it. There is now an never ending stream of new posts, some of which are closed down only to reappear again the next day. TA could add Spain, Germany and France to the list as well, as all have over 1,000 cases now."

The orange banner has now disappeared. Maybe TA is going to correct it?
Still there for me.
"I see the orange banner. Not at the top of this thread, but in the main page for Support."
I noticed TA has now corrected the mistake in the orange banner to state :- TRAVEL NOTICE: Learn more about COVID-19.Angie.
I think the article has been updated too.
"I post regularly in the China forum, but I get no ""Reply"" buttons in your sticky. Some people are able to reply so it must be possible. I am using the web version on an Android phone, logged in via the co.uk site."
I think there are some issues on the mobile site.

"Colleen, thanks for your post. I need some help with a guest that would be traveling down to México from US. she says that due to the airport security, she thinks she might not be able to fly back to the US,and maybe will have to cancel her trip. I dont think it would be fair that she lost her money because my cancellation policy is super strict, but since this is a global thing its not her fault. So my question is, how do we proceed? Who can I talk to about this?Thank you!"
"#36 See the Stickie at the top of the forum..... (COVID-19) Information for OwnersEdited: 2:09 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"#37 thank you! I cant find a way to reach someone, the links they posted keep sending me to a home page and a list of issues and their answers, but nothing on this topic... Hope to find an answer soon!Thanks again"
"Adrigdl ~If you own a Vacation Rental, you will need to contact the platform you listed with: Flipkey, Holiday Lettings, etc.If you have a hotel, Inn, B&B, you can ask this question in the Owners’’ Forum."
"Thank you! My listing is on tripadvisor, actually other platforms have reached out to owners with their policies concerning COVID. About the owners forum, I cannot respond to the thread, not sure why but cant see the Reply option.Thank you for taking the time to respond!"

The orange banner is still not showing on mobile.
No one seems to be reading it anyway.
"https:/…106027300The TA info is all about the traveler risks, not negative externalities from asymptomatic travelers spreading the virus as they travel and return home. #sadEdited: 11:39 am, March 14, 2020 "
"https:/…index.htmlAsymptomatic people are spreading disease. So much for ""I don't think I am at risk."" They may not be but spread virus. Sick. Selfish. Stupid.TA better step up before govermnent has to shut movement down.Edited: 9:58 pm, March 14, 2020 "

Can a guest receive a refund on the Tripadvisor vacation rentals booking free if they have to cancel ?
Tour398932 ~You will have to contact FlipKey or Holiday Lettings or ??? - whichever one took your booking.Open this link and find the phone number for the company you booked with or use the email provided in #5.You may be directed further from there.
"Dear All, Please be aware that travelers from countries in Europe's Schengen border-free travel zone will need to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Hong Kong.After 40 days without any case, a South Koren foreign worker traveling from Porto, Portugal, to Macau through Dubay tested positive after an urgent consult in Macau central hospital. The new consequences on foreigners' arrivals in Macau will be announced today afternoon local hour.Keep safe; this is very serious."
"Dear All,Please be aware that, from today, all visitors to Macau, except those coming from Mainland of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, will need to do a 14-day quarantine under medical vigilance. Macau residents are allowed to do the quarantine at home under preventive vigilance; all the others will do the quarantine on the present government facilities selected for this purpose.Keep safe and informed."
What about if we have a Vacation Rental booked through TripAdvisor and we now need to cancel due to COVID-19. How do we do that without eating an enormous amount of the cost through the cancellation policy? Even hotels and airbnb have gotten very flexible due to COVID-19 and I hope TripAdvisor will too to discourage the spread of this virus..
Where can I speak to TA about a vacation rental that I will not be bale to use because of UK and USA government policies and flight cancellations?
Better late than never the orangeTRAVEL NOTICE: Learn more about COVID-19 banner has finally appeared on the TA mobile site.Angie.
Thank you for your reply and advice. I have already disseminated the warns regarding Hong and Macau throughout other social networks. Thanks. Regards.
"We have had to cancel our trip for a wedding to California as the wedding is being moved due to the virus, national state of emergency and so forth. What concessions is TA offering for a rental cancellation 6 weeks out outside of the 30% refund policy?"
"#56,EXACTLY, with whom did you rent, and what did you rent?Those answers might help the volunteers here, direct you.Best of luck,Hunt"
"@Hunt. I think this is a holiday rental because Jennifer wrote ""What concessions is TA offering for a rental cancellation"".@Jennifer, try contacting support via this form https:/…Customer_Support_Form"
"Angelina, yes, finally. It appeared late last night for me."
"Yes, condo rental. Flipkey."

"Thank you. All said, my bad for not reading flipkeys cancel policy better. It’s pathetic compared to vrbo, et al."
"Summerlodge, please stop spamming multiple forums with copy and paste of the same thing, which is unrelated to the questions people are asking. I assume you are trying to promote and to get your business name on dozens of forums. TripAdvisor staff may end up removing your postings as Spam and duplicates."
"Hi. I have just had to cancel my parent's booking for May (before TA took the balance)? They are both over 75 and vulnerable, therefore there is no way they are going to get to travel there. I know Airbnb are refunding the deposits. Can you confirm TA's policy on refunding travel due to Covid-19?"
