"I'm looking to book a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. My knowledge of portuguese is very limited, but I suppose with Gol '1ª bagagem gratuita' means I can take one hold luggage bag along?what other luggage option might there be? I'll b staying in a hotel in Rio at the north end of Copacapana beach, and I doubt I can leave my suitcase there and travel only with handluggage (it would be sufficient).How can I safely get to the airport, and back to a hotel in Rio for a night after this little trip? Can I get safe taxis at either airport, and do hotels generally provide safe taxis? Single woman, traveling alone.Thanks a lot.Edited: 2 years ago "
"If this is just a one-day trip make sure your departure is from Santos Dumont airport (SDU). It’s closer to Copacabana than the larger GIG. In São Paulo, it doesn’t matter too much which airport you use if you’re going to downtown. If you’re headed to a different neighborhood, check if GRU or CGH is closer to your destination. Regarding Taxis, SDU has an Uber Lounge which is very convenient. You can also take (radio)taxis/uber at GRU. Not sure if Uber operates at CGH. 1a bagagem gratuito means one checked bag included. Nowadays, the cheapest fare usually comes without checked lugguage, although it can be added separately prior to flight for an extra cost."
"Thanks a lot. It's planned as a 3-4 day trip but I don't need all my business luggage with me. But if I can't leave it anywhere then I'll bring it along and pay for the transport by plane. yes, I thought about flying from SDU, just because it's much more conveniently situated. I plan to rent a car in Sao Paolo and drive elsewhere to visit friends. With regards to Uber or taxis: well.. the actual trip to Rio is a business trip and the inviting company keeps on telling all participants how dangerous it is, not to go somewhere alone, etc (last year two people were robbed on the beach). Thus I'm a bit uncertain about taking a taxi. But I don't know how else to get to the airport, and after the trip back to my hotel."
It’s alright to take a taxi or Uber. Take Uber select/black if that makes you more comfortable. There’s also apps here that match up female passengers with female drivers only. In SP you’d be much better off sticking to taxi/Uber than renting your own car. Traffic is hectic there.
"Femitaxi was launched due to comments from females about the inappropriate and unprofessional behavior of some male taxi drivers. The app is available on iTunes.http://bit.ly/2xo1JVUAirlines in Brazil:GOL: http://www.voegol.com.brLATAM: http://www.tam.com.brAZUL: http://www.voeazul.com.brAVIANCA: http://www.avianca.com.br/enRio's airports:Galeao International Airport (GIG):Located on an island in Guanabara Bay, Galeao International Airport serves most international and intercontinental flights to Rio.

"Well, I don't intend to stay in Sao Paulo but visit a state forest a few hours outside of town. I could potentially take a driver, but then I would again need to trust a driver as a single traveller. I've driven cars in southern Italy, all across the Middle East (Qatar is worst) and SE Asia without any accidents. What I've seen in Brazil so far was relaxed."
donnanoble: It might not be wise (or even possible) to visit forested areas in and around São Paulo because of the Yellow Fever epidemic. Have you been vaccinated for Yellow Fever?
"Actually yes, I have! Need to check how long the vaccination is good for. Is this yellow fever something recent? I last looked at this trip last year but could not realize it due to rather chaotic business obligations.Is there a map that shows the affected areas?Edited: 2 years ago "
The shot for Yellow Fever confers lifetime immunity.Have a look at this link:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30363…
"“I don't intend to stay in Sao Paulo but visit a state forest a few hours outside of town”Well, that changes everything of course. I enjoy driving in Brazil personally. It’s pretty hectic at times and rules in the countryside are rarely obeyed (but French and Italian drivers can be just as bad haha). Obviously if you have YF vaccination and you’re comfortable driving in different countries you should be good to go. A couple of remarks:- Brazilian speed bumps are massive and often poorly marked. Keep an eye out for those!- Waze and Google maps are good GPS apps but do not know what areas are less safe. You’ll likely be on highways a lot (at least until your outside the metropolitan area) but be careful to not be (or not accept to be) rerouted to avoid traffic jams."
