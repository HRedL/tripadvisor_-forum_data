I got a blister on my right big toe from running around too much. Never got a blister before and this is my 12th time here. Most likely the tainted alcohol. Any advice greatly appreciated
Are you sure it isn't from Aqua Aerobics with a full Bubba in your left hand?
You should for sure write a review and do your part to keep the traveling public informed of this very serious issue that could be of grave concern.The number of travelers you could help with your info should not be underestimated.;-)Happy travels.
"oh, and one more piece of advice...Try ice cream.lolololHappy travels."
"Wow, this is becoming just like Survivor... Sending thoughts and prayers!Edited: 1 year ago "
Try more rum !
"Yikes! This is how it starts! One blister on an innocent tourist. Next thing you know, blisters spreading like the plague! Hundreds of tourists will be quarantined. Please don't let NY Post, CNN, Vice or any other ""credible"" news source get a hold of this story. Remove this thread ASAP for the good of the country!"

Haha. Replies are great advice. I will take each under advisement. Sorry for the misspelling of Punta. CanA. On the beach with a pina colada and can’t see my iPhone!!!

"Do Canadians get blisters? LOL. Kidding wahoowa. I would make sure of the entertainment staff assisted by one or two bartenders monitor your vitals and provide plenty of liquid medication for your last 4 days. Rest, liquid, repeat."
No doubt the only blister fixing machine in the country is broken.Mark
Would you like us to alert the media and/or the US Embassy? I assume there are before and after photographs.Edited: 1 year ago 
Who is going to take the lead white knight in this fight to warn other tourists of blisters? Won't be long until scores of people are laying on the beach withering in pain with no relief in sight! Who is going to be the TA hero that will save the day and skin of hundreds (thousands?) of tourists? I have already started a GoFundMe for people to donate so we can purchase dozens of bandaids....
BANDAIDS? We need helicopters.Edited: 1 year ago 
"Oh wow.., I didn't know that blisterosis was running rampart through PC., should I cancel my trip ?"
"SWNova - if you have to ask, you probably shouldn't be making these adult decisions!https:/…264783.php"
I'll take one for the team and pack up my treatment bag and head down to help you out - what resort :-)Bugs
Are you sure you didn't catch that blister from someone else?
kdsmith - that's a great question! Or maybe it was a pre-existing blister that was reopened in DR?! Way too many unknowns right now. I am going to wait until the blister machine is repaired and a report is released prior to making any judgement or decisions!
I had a blister on my foot when we were there in May. I think it's probably an epidemic. I wish I had taken photos as proof! Might need it for the Class A lawsuit.
SBDriver - Don't forget to report it at iwasblistered.com
This is Mrs Wahoowa.. unfortunately Mr Wahoowa succumbed to his injuries. We now believe someone planted sandpaper under the sand in a deliberate attempt to inflict severe blisters to my husband. Either that or he’s passed out because he drank too much Brugal. More to come.
Nothing wrong with a little siesta in the middle of the afternoon.After he wakes up give him a few gulps of espresso and he will be ready for round two
So brave of bugsareus to sacrifice himself by going to PC to help out. A true hero.
"Best post I've read in a long time, I could actually laugh. I am noticing that two certain individuals are not posting any comments on this one. Perhaps they are thinking on how to make the media report this blister as a deadly situation."
Mrs Wahoowa - this is no laughing matter! Blisters can become infected. Infection could spread or develop into something worse. Amputation possibly?! Your husbands balance could forever be altered!!!!! Also are you sure it was sandpaper? Illicit sandpaper? What grit we talking about here?
Thank goodness the DR government are opening that new Blister Reporting Centre!
"I agree with ThatGuy.,it sounds like it might have been dangerous illicit black market sandpaper , 40% grit.,the real rough stuff..,only cure for it is even more Brugal !"
"SWNova - you gotta be careful with the illicit stuff! They use mostly glass in their mixture... especially the 40%. And you're spot on with the relief... a solid dose or 2 of Brugal (white or dark) should do the trick. I hear mamajuana works just as well but may also cause additional side effects such as double vision, slurred speech, disruption of memory, headaches and/or limited motor skills."
"Just so we're clear, I also treated my blister with Brugal. Cleared it up after a few days. The first 3 days I was drinking it, then I realized I should apply a few drops to a bandaid and apply directly to the wound. That seemed to do the trick."
"I just want to say that First and most importantly, I hope that Mr Wahoowa heals quickly. That could lead to a serious issue like amputation, or worse, Ruin Mrs Wahoowa's vacation as she will have to do all the runs to the bar as poor mister is now unable to! Were is the compassion for HER vacation lost???Second. I just had a crap day at work, wanted to come home and curl up in a ball. This thread is fantastic and seriously just boosted my mood, and therefore my night (not to mention Greg will appreciate not hearing me moan and complain when he gets home. Off to google chance of amputation from a blister! Lynn"
"Excellent plan SB! Very effective.LOL LynnOh, and I've finally got a follower - feeling a little left out, but low and behold, home from work and notified that Caroleaisamoron has decided to follow me. So excited to have an entourage!!Keep that blister elevated and out of the sun WahoowaBugs"
"I had a blister in PC a few years back.I read the instructions for a cure on the back of a bottle of Barcelo.I actually misread the label telling me to drink 2-3 oz and drank 23 oz.Should have looked at the side effects .OOPS Dear Barcelo After drinking your product I was suppodse to walk straighter ,talk better dance waaaay better!After seeing the video we need to have a talk"
"https:/…complicationsAre there any complications?Left untreated, serious infections can begin to spread to other areas of your body. In addition, bacteria can enter the blistered skin and result in a condition called cellulitis. This is a rapidly spreading skin infection. It can quickly become a medical emergency if it spreads to your lymph nodes or bloodstream.Infected blisters can also lead to sepsis in severe cases. This happens when certain chemicals released by your immune system trigger a chain reaction in your body. Eventually, this can lead to septic shock. Septic shock is fatal about half the time. However, most people recover from milder cases of sepsis.UNTREATED BLISTERS ARE NO JOKE!!!!!!!"
THIS is the forum I miss!!!To MRS Wahoowa... Thanks for the update. We ALL look forward to more info on this serious condition!
Really??? This is the most ridiculous post. More ridiculous than the links being posted here. Very childish SMH
Well that's us told then...
"Christina.,and yet here you are .,"
Glad you can joke about the sickness/deaths in DR. Our friend spend weeks in the hospital after a trip to Punta Cana . Lost 40 pounds. There will always be sickness when you cannot drink the water. It is time for their government to provide clean drinking water. They receive millions of dollars from tourist trade. Sorry to be so serious about a serious matter but glad I got that out there.
NOBODY is joking about about actual deaths in DR. This thread is a light-hearted response to weeks of trolling on this forum by someone with a vendetta who has been posting over the top tabloid articles and fake news.Edited: 1 year ago

"I apologize for no updates but as you can imagine, it’s been a living hell.. also, I thought they closed the thread and deleted my post.. here’s what has transpired. The blister on my toe grew to the size of a tennis ball I tell youI contacted the US embassy, the local authorities, and the person who is watching our dogI tried to be airlifted out of our resort, saw the helicopters circling, got excited as relief was almost in sight ,but alas, they were only sightseeing helicoptersThe bartenders were extremely worried. Kept giving me medicine to dull the pain. I believe the chemical name of the medicine was “mamajuana”. After a few of those, I forgot I had a toeThe next day, the medicine wore off but for some unknown reason, my head hurt as wellMy wife was growing increasingly worried as she wanted me to go on a 3 mile hike down the beach. Her very loving words to me.. and I swear I’ll never forget this as long as I live,... she told me to “SUCK IT UP”I got a needle, pierced the basketball size blister, put a band aid on it.. folks, I think I’m curedThe lesson here for all is that PC is a bad place, it put me in pain. The bartenders fool you in to thinking they’re Physicians.. they are not. If it wasn’t for the advice of a very strong lady, this may have turned out gravely different. Adios and thank you for all the advice and prayers. YOU ALL GOT ME THROUGH THIS!!Edited: 1 year ago "
So happy for your update Wahoowa! Please enjoy the rest of your vacation. You've earned it!
"I'm very glad this serious epidemic has been brought to light. I've gotten a blister on my toe not once but TWICE during 2 consecutive visits to the DR! Luckily I had brought my own band-aids and purchased the emergency medical evacuation insurance so I'm still here to tell my story. Inexplicably, I have returned to the DR 2 more times since then. I think it has some kind of magical hold over me. I got rid of those sandals."
"You can make light of it, but the people that were affected are still being affected by what happened in the DR. Your insensitivity is apalling."
"Elaine, no one is making light of the deaths or illnesses. This only has to do with the fear mongers that have been around lately banging their drums of doom. If you haven't been around here to witness it, consider yourself lucky.Happy travels."
"""It is time for their government to provide clean drinking water. ""Wow, how very privileged of you. They do have clean drinking water. It comes in bottles. Also, the locals don't have issues, just the travelers because they aren't used to the local bacteria. Are you seriously insisting they change their whole drinking water system to work for every tourist that possibly goes there? The actual resorts have filtered water they use for cooking and ice. They have bottled water to drink. So instead of using their government funds to help those who are impoverished, they should do something more for you?Elaine is convinced her sickness is due to the DR even though she had tests run and the doctor's couldn't pinpoint a cause. Elaine, if your doctor can't give you a cause, find a new doctor. It's very rare that something you can catch on vacation would last for months later."
"Best thread in awhile, Elaine, no one is making light of the situation, this is just a fun thread which was needed after those intense few weeks. @47) what a pleasure moose to have you drop in here, you always make me laugh."
"moose54 - I see you have also been a victim of black market band aids! They just don't adhere like the real deal eh!?! Especially in water!Mr Wahoowah - thank you for your update. I could not sleep at all last night as I was thinking about you and your blister and the possibility of it spreading to hundreds of thousands of tourists! Illicit sandpaper, only a matter of time before that stuff makes it way into Home Depot, Lowes, and Home Hardware (I got you Canadians ;))."
"Elaine... ohrana, Robert.. whatever name you are going by now, I am, absolutely not poking fun or belittling any fatal or serious event. As been told to you, this is poking fun at the “all gloom, all the time!” Posters. You cannot be this dense"
"Mr Wahoowa, I'm so pleased to hear that you are on the road to recovery from this awful blister business. I hope you complained immediately to the management, as this is clearly the fault of the hotel & must be dealt with accordingly. Have you put in a claim for compensation ? ( I feel a 3 figure sum may be in order) due to the severity of the injury and lack of care shown by hotel staff (apart from the bartenders who obviously knew the best way to deal with your plight.) I am due to visit DR again very soon & I'm now very concerned about blisteritis becoming an epidemic. I'll be contacting my travel agent before I travel & hope to get reassurance that blisteritis is not on the increase. In the meantime, I wish you well & hope you don't encounter any further upset during your well earned holiday. Do you think I need to take out additional insurance for this trip as a precaution against possible blisteritis ?"
Hey that guy in a hammock from Windsor. Beautiful reply. BTW you must be a Red wing fan. I am a life-long fan from Prescott On.
