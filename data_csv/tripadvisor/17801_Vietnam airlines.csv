Does anyone have anymore details on this?https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/compan…
"Better cut flying than putting people in quarantaine, wonder how long they won't fly"
"Absolutely, it's ridiculous to fly people out. I am crossing my fingers that our flight is cancelled, we are due to fly from Heathrow on the 27th but haven't been notified yet."
I was supposed to be on that flight too. At least if they cancel it guaranteed a full refund! I'm holding out cancelling it myself until the last minute!
Same here we are booked to fly from Heathrow on the 30th March and now hoping it’s cancelled
We will just have to hold our nerve !!!
Yes us too we are due to fly out on the 29th March....i am consumed by it all and really hope they cancel soon so we can all get a refund and go next year instead. We are a family of 8 and have been planning this trip for a year but really want it to be a great experience not looking over our shoulders waiting for the police to put us all in quarantine!
I'm flying Tuesday. In transit through. No idea if I'll get through. No evisa either. Gutted.
Their website now states that flights are being cancelled. I am just waiting for an email from them I guess.Has anyone also got internal flights with them too?
"I’ve got return flights from Heathrow plus three internal flights all with Vietnam airlines, or maybe I should say I did have."
"Yes we have return flights from Heathrow too, had only booked one internal flight.Has anyone found out which flights outbound/inbound are cancelled ?Please post if you find out"
Our flight from Heathrow on the 16th shows as going but obviously we won't be on it .
Just tried to do a dummy booking to find out which flights are going and it looks like all are going in March from Heathrow- Hanoi except the 28th. Then no flights 1st 2nd 3rd 4th April.
"We were due to fly in two weeks time with Vietnam Airlines. After hearing about the cancellations, I tried to find out which flights had been cancelled. This morning I checked and our flight to Hanoi from London was not showing as bookable and when I checked my booking the details, the full details were not available. I’ve just checked and they have cancelled our flight and automatically moved us to a flight the following day. So far, no notification from the airline about this change. We haven’t been able to get a visa anyway, and to be honest given the situation, I’m going to cancel the trip. It’s not worth the effort to try to obtain a visa by rebooking our trip via an authorised tour operator and it’s not worth the risk of getting there to be quarantined. Also I believe it’s irresponsible of us to put the pressure on Vietnam should we be infected when we travel but not be aware of it. The battle to get a refund will begin. It’s very disappointing, but we are all facing difficult times."
"You will get a full refund. My flight changed to 3 days later. They have said flights will be fully refunded.Edited: 5:20 pm, March 12, 2020 "
CathM where did they say flights would be fully refunnded? I am not doubting you but it would he useful to know but before I try and get a refund
"We've now cancelled our trip as unable to get Visas.Our internal flights were with Vietnam Airlines, made contact for refund via Twitter and they told me to email for refund, that was 2 days ago and nothing yet so will have to start chasing them up!"
"One of our Internal Vietnam airlines flights was changed my a few hours. Means we could cancel for free.Separately, after badgering their twitter and email teams for 3 days I got them to waive the fee for moving our main international flights to October. Although we had to pay excess fare"
"#15 of 17 ·CathM where did they say flights would be fully refunnded?It doesn't ""say"" anywhere. I used my initiative and contacted the airline!"
"Hi Cath,I saw from your previous post that you were due to be on the same flight as us.Did you manage to get through on the UK phone number or did you email.?Thanks"
"Hi, actually my flight was on the 28th! Have you looked at your booking to see if they have changed your flight? Ours was changed to the 1st April but no notification. Just noticed it myself. Then FB messaged VA who confirmed we could have full refund both ways. Fingers crossed for you xx"
"Just got in touch via Facebook and our flight is unfortunately still going, We are definitely not going even if we don't get a refund."
"Does anyone know who would be responsible for my refund, booked through eDreams and flying BA to London then Vietnam to Hanoi. If Vietnam Airlines cancel would the onus be on them or BA?"
"I used twitter DMs to get them to reply to my emails: send email, follow up on twitter, send email, follow up on twitter, repeat, repeat. Eventually got my flights moved to October for no fee (but had to pay small excess fare)."
"After the FCO news regarding visas today, sent a message to Vietnam Airlines to ask to cancel our internal flight only to be told it's non refundable as its Economy. Did you have any luck Martin ?"
"We cancelled our international flights nearly two weeks ago. Got an email in which they accepted a refund, but this refund only included my girlfriend's tickets, not mine. Contacted them on this last saturday again but now they have neither sent any money nor answered me again. Wrote them again yesterday. Now I don't even receive an automatic email anymore. I don't have twitter yet. Should I try it that way?"
"They just announced this on twitter To slow the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 epidemic for the sake of public health, from March 15th, 2020, Vietnam Airlines flights departing from London (UK), Paris (France), and Frankfurt (Germany) to Vietnam will not carry passengers"
For 30 days.
"Surely they should now refund passengers in full then? UK residents should be ok anyway about getting their money back, even if Vietnam Airlines don't pay up, as travel insurance will now pay up now the Foreign Office advice is don't go.."
"Yep it's official. I think I will be fine getting a refund for the long haul flights between London and Vietnam but what is my position for domestic flights. I had 3 internsl flights between Hanoi, HCMC, Danang and assume these are still flying. Bearing in mind I cannot get into the country am I covered for these internal flights I cannot make through no fault of my own,? Presumably if the airline deny the claim my travel insurance would pick up? Thank you"
> am I covered for these internal flightsCheck here:https://www.vietnamairlines.com/~/media/Files/VNANew/Travel%20Information/Covid-19/0313-en-ticket-change-and-refund-covid19.pdf
"Strange days indeed, I feel your pain Richard and everyone else. Lost our Formula 1 this weekend and now it looks like the holiday in May as well. Can only be a matter of time before their flights from here are included.Choosing a date to reschedule is going to be challenging."
"Never mind, I live near the circuit, much worse for those who travelled here for it and Hanoi losing their inaugural event.We must keep dreaming."
"Profcorbett - Re the internal flights, do you have travel insurance? If so then if the airlines won't refund you then insurance shouldEdited: 8:00 am, March 14, 2020 "
"As posted my manatdollar they have now updated their rules.https://www.vietnamairlines.com/~/media/Files/VNANew/Travel%20Information/Covid-19/0313-en-ticket-change-and-refund-covid19.pdfDomestic flights ""follows fare rules"" for refunds despite the fact you can't get into the country. Its a free of charge ticket change subject to any variations.Debating what to do, we're definitely wanting to go back next year but flights are not available that far in advance to change to.So de"
Ok thanks..I think my circumstances will mean travel insurance should cover the internal flights. I have had it confirmed by the agent who dealt with the heathrow-hanoi flight that I will get a refund with on 6 to 8 weeks. Is this in line with everyone else's experience. Seems to be a very long time
"Just when you thought it was all clear, this pops up:…vietnamairlines.com/vi/tintuc/news-114/viet…"
Now that is bizarre
"Forgive me if i read it wrong, for me they say back to Vietnam, does this mean people who live in Vietnam only?Can't imagine they are sending tourists."
"Here is the full txt from Twitter:https:/…This appears to superseded the information from yesterday, as I cannot now find that link. As with past information, it is not clear and VA are not responding to email or twitter"
GOV UK are advising against all but essential travel to Vietnam which is still current today . We were travelling tomorrow and when checking online it shows our flight is still going .

> We were travelling tomorrow and when checking online it shows our flight is still goingWell the plane will probably fly empty to bring people back from Vietnam. And Vietnamese nationals can still fly if they're using their Vietnamese passports
"Yea, the Hanoi Times link is old... That was the days before news.Today's is this:…vietnamairlines.com/vi/tintuc/news-114/viet…The way I'm reading it, they're saying they're carrying passengers and have u-turned on their decision 24 hours earlier."
"Question is; why did they change their mind? Money? Political pressure? Thankfully the UK FCO advise against all but essential travel to Vietnam, so hopefully still in with a chance of getting some money back."
"> Question is; why did they change their mind? Money? Political pressure?They just overstated what they were were going to do. There was never a restriction on Vietnamese people on Vietnamese passports flying home. > carry passengers meeting all immigration and health requirements back to Vietnam on flights departing from London (the UK), Paris (France), and Frankfurt (Germany).So that's just healthy Vietnamese nationals travelling on Vietnamese pasports. It certainly doesn't include UK nationals who are barred from entry due to having been in the UK."
"The latest announcement doesn't mention Vietnamese only... Granted, the previous press release did. On FB they're advising anyone can travel with the right documents and subject to a health interview... No mention of Vietnamese only there either."
"> The latest announcement doesn't mention Vietnamese only... Granted, the previous press release did.Well, the UK / Schengen restriction is on TOURISTS:> temporarily suspend entry for tourists who come from the Schengen countries> Foreigners who are experts, business managers, highly skilled workers entering Viet Nam will be medical checked and quarantine shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Health.All from …chinhphu.vn/Home/…39178.vgpI glossed over the exceptions since this is primarily a forum for tourists. I'm pretty sure diplomats are excluded too."
"Don't believe that they fly in tourists, my feeling says only Vietnamese back to Vietnam"
"> Don't believe that they fly in touristsOf course they don't, but there are other categories in addition to Vietnamese nationals travelling on Vietnamese pasports."
Had an email from Vietnam airlines earlier asking me to check in online !!
Manatdollar it's not clear for travelers on short notice.Here they are closing down almost everything like in many other European countries so why would Vietnam fly in tourists with all the risk. Coronavirus cases are rising again in Vietnam.

"So, it changes again but its not clear: ""Vietnam Airlines is suspending the connecting flight of itineraries""https://www.vietnamairlines.com/gb/en/news-t…"
I wasn't using Vietnam airlines for international flights but been communicating with VA regarding a refund on my domestic flights.Of my internal flights one has now been rescheduled 7 days later than original flight (useless if I had been in Vietnam) and one has been cancelled.Hoping to get a full refund now!
