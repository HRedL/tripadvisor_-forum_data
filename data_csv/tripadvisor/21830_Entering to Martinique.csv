"Hi,If you're coming from Paris you can travel to Martinique at any time. You just need to do a PCR test 72 hours prior to your departure. There's no quarantine for travellers. But it's important to stay updated with government information as the situation continues to change."
Here are links to the travel information posted by the French government in English and in French. https:/…https:/…
"Yes.there are plenty of labs in Martinique that do the PCR test. If you can, call ahead and verify their procedures. Some labs only do the tests in the morning.Make sure to come early."
