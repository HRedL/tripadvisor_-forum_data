"Hi,I have had a holiday in Samoa booked for the end of April, but I just found out that I am pregnant and am getting all this advice not to go. I wanted to know if anyone has been to Samoa recently while pregnant and if Zika is still a big thing there? Would it be ok to go but just constantly lather myself in DEET mosquito spray? I have tried researching online but all information regarding Samoa is a year out of date, and anything current is just all just generalised warnings.Any advice would be appreciated!"
"Hi KatherineAt this point in time the Samoan Government advises that the Zika virus is not present.The Dept of Foreign Affairs, Australia states ""protect yourself from mosquitoes day and night. Dengue, Zika and chikungunya outbreaks can occur"". I think you should email the Ministry for Health, Samoa and ask them for a more detailed explanation of the situation. Also, what does your doctor say and is he/she in a position to find out more for you?Sorry I can't help further and congrats on your pregnancy.CheersDeb"
"Thanks Deb. That makes me feel a bit better. I did try to go to Ministry for Health website but it says that its under construction, so isn't much help. Am seeing my doctor this week so will see what else they say and if they can find out more for me. :)"
"Hi KatherineIt appears the website is back up here:http://www.samoagovt.ws/minister-moh/I've done a search for Zika and nothing comes up so use the contact form option and ask them directly, or, if you can, ring themApologies that it's so difficult to get any info but hopefully your doctor may be able to find out more as well.If Zika has become like Dengue Fever, Typhoid and chikungunya there are only very occasional outbreaks and mostly in the middle of the wet season, which is not April.CheersDeb"
"Hello Kathryn,Look up the 'World Mosquito Program', they should have the most up to date information. Any of these mosquito borne diseases can pop up anytime. If only they could be completely eradicated, the world would be a somewhat safer place....If you do decide to go, just the usual warnings. Cover yourself up, especially evening/overnight. Light loose clothing, or try and stay indoors then. Deet or mozzie spray (if you wish).Just be vigilant."
"Hi there, I was just wondering if you ended up going on your holiday? I have just found out that I am pregnant and have a trip booked in a few weeks. Getting total mixed messages about whether or not to go. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
"Hi,Contracts on the pregnancy. I didn't end up going but that was mainly because I ended up having a large cyst on ovary which could have ruptured if I flew. I was planning on going and just lathering myself in mosquito repellent. According to the various hotel staff I talked to it isn't really a big thing there anymore and the hotel generally spray for mosquitos anyway. But I guess it just comes down to whether you are comfortable taking the risk or not."
"Hi Katherine,I really appreciate your response. Sorry to hear that you didn’t end up going. I hope you are well. It’s such a hard one with what you read online. I will keep investigating and make a decision. Thank you!"
"Hi S Menz, Just wondering if you found out anything in relation to Zika in Samoa? We have a trip booked and like you and Katherine we have found out we are pregnant and unsure if we should go with the risk. I cant find any clear information lolThanks"
"Hi Ladies!I find myself in the same boat but would really love a holiday before the next baby arrives! Any further info on Zika in Samoa that you have found? Looking at going in late October/early Nov, anyone been during this time?"
Zika is not active in Samoa at present but if you go between October and May mozzies will be very active as it's the wet season so be extra vigilant with repellent. Cheers Deb
"@S menz - That's so helpful! I'm heading off today and have been worried about it! Really appreciate the update.Edited: 11:14 pm, November 08, 2019 "
"Zika is certainly not a problem in Samoa at this time - but measles are. Officially declared an epidemic. So make sure about your immunization.Edited: 8:57 pm, November 09, 2019 "
if you havent been immunised for measles dont go. their is a current state of emergency for measles outbreak. but if you are immunised you should be fine.
