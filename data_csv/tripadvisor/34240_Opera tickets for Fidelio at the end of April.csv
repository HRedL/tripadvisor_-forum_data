"Hello, hope everyone is safe. My friends had plans to visit Vienna and Prague this spring and I had purchased tickets to see Fidelio on April 25 at the Vienna Opera House. Due to the pandemic we have had to cancel our plans, and we have been very impressed with the help we have encountered from the Airlines, hotels and other tours we had reserved. But I haven't been able to communicate with the Opera site, I am guessing, everything is canceled. Am I right? Any advise? Thank you"
Currently cancelled only until 13 April.
"HelloI recommend you to check this link: https:/… - there you can find the contact where you can write concerning your request - and they will be able to give you advice.Performances as mentioned above only cancelled till now til the 13th April: https:/… Best regards, Beatriz"
That link does say they are only dealing with cancellations for tickets for performances up to 13 April. But by all means keep checking it.
