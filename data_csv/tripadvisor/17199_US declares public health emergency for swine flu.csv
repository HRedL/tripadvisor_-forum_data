…yahoo.com/s/…us_swine_flu_emergencyFound this on the Cancun forum.....lots of people on that forum are just as worried as we all are......I'm supposed to fly out 2 weeks from today.......
"Karissa1977 Like I mentioned in the earlier posts today, is try to find some travel insurance to cover your trip in case you would have to cancel. There are several out there and some that come to mind are www.travelguard and www.travelex.com Yes the us now delcared an us public health emergency and yesThe students from New York were down in CANCUN, so people that are saying there is nothing to be alrmed about should really get the facts straight. I can tell you from my experience that if you do get really ill down there, it can be a nightmare from hell to get things taken care of and they demand payment immediately...... I am not sure how many people carry several thousand dollars with them as crdeit cards are not acceppted in a lot the places. So travel wisely and do get travelers insurance and do not ignore the warnings, as some people just think they are invicnible and they are not, as none of us are.  Also be sure that the travel insurance you get will pay the service provivder as many will only reimburse you after you return home and file a claim. I have been through the hassles and learned a lot.... Its just information that I think that its good to know and share with all people that use the site here.questions pm meThanksSnowman :0)"
"Check with your travel provider to see if they offer the option to postpone or a credit to travel elsewhere during the dates you already have. If you decide to get travel insurance, make sure this outbreak is covered as others are saying that some do not cover epidemics.If you have to go, as we may (we are scheduled to fly May 1st), see if you can get some Tamiflu to bring with just in case as it can help reduce the symptoms.Nobody knows where this is going yet, so panic is not warranted. The next few days are probably going to let us all know how this impacts our vacations. In the meantime, we are going to pray for those affected and hope the situation resolves quickly."
"Dang! This is the 1st time I didn't purchase travel insurance. Wouldn't you know....For all the others in the same situation, I looked into purchasing travel insurance this weekend... Many sites are stating that because the swine flu is a ""known event"", that policies purchased on or after April 24th will not include coverage for anything swine flu related... If you purchased insurance before April 24th, you are fine. We are watching this closely, as it is a serious situation, but we are still looking forward to our much needed vacation and have no plans of cancelling. Hopefully this will all settle down by next month... Does anyone know what precautions, if any, CRT is taking? "
"check your travel insurance policy carefully. most won't cover a ""pandemic"" or ""epidemic""hopefully those who purchased the cxcl for any reason coverage will be ok. "
"Yeah, we didn't purchase any travel insurance....but from what others are saying it wouldn't matter anyways or now it would be too late because they wouldn't cover anything ""swine"" related. Hopefully Orbitz will be kind to it's customers and let us change travel plans or reschedule to a later date if need be....."
