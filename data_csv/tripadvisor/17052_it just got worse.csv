"i just heard this latest development on sky news:the first person to contract the flu virus without a link to mexico has just been discovered in spain.this means that the virus has the ability to jump from human to human and is likely to lift the pandemic alert from level 4 to level 5.we're due to travel on 1st july and this is starting to look less likely. GUTTEDplease, please make it all go away!!mark"
It was raised to level 4 when they confirmed human to human transmission days ago.
"hi artie1check out this article, about 1/2 way down…sky.com/skynews/…regards"
"Phase four covers human to human contracting of the disease.""Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks.”""Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region.""By definition (although not classified as such) this has been at level 5 since it first started showing up in the US days ago."
The WHO have not been able to confirm human-human in mex due to the lack of info and testing being done there. That it why they have just sent a task force to find out more in mex 1st country confirmed is US and Spain is now the second thus upgrade to 5 willnow take place
"Better re-read your own article.As it states;""The alert level is currently at 4, which means it is being passed among people."""
who cares whos right level 1 2 3 4 5 it still doesnt change the fact its serious enough to ruin my honeymoon how about some REAL info people.
If you need real info check with the CDC and WHO. All you'll find here is a rehashing of what the media reports and that's mostly rumor and inuendo.
