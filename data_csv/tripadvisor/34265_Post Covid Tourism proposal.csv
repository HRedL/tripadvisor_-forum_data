"https:/…Just read this...with rules as strict as these I don't think anyone will bother coming to the Maldives. Visa 100$, test 100$ plus stying in the room at the resort until you get the test results. Better not open if they intend on doing this."
"Thank you for sharing this article Nina. We were due to make a long awaited return trip to Outrigger Konotta in 2 weeks time and as sad that I am that we won't be doing so, this article doesn't make it sound like travelling to The Maldives will be very much fun when tourism is allowed to begin again later this year or early next. Clearly the tourism industry is crippled at the moment and I appreciate that the Maldivian Government and resort owners are keen to welcome guests again as soon as possible, and to do so as safely as possible. However additional costs for Visas and COVID testing and securing medical certificates before leaving home and testing on arrival, along with a requirement that tourists have a booking of a minimum of 14 days at a single ""safe tourism"" certified destination will put a different complexion on holiday for most travellers. Add to that the measures that the article suggests may be put in place at resorts to keep guests and staff safe and you have a very different feel to a Maldivian holiday to that which we knew pre-COVID. For some (us included as my husband is classed as ""extremely vulnerable"" and would not travel until a vaccine is available) it will simply mean an end to our hopes to return due for some time. Others who will wish to travel as soon as it is permitted to do so will need to tailor their holidays to ensure they meet all of the criteria it's suggested here might be put in place as a requirement to obtain and entry visa. This would mean increased costs, longer stays in resort and possibly having to quarantine on their return to their home country too. Food for thought for all. Whilst it is of course pleasing to see plans being considered to allow safe tourism to commence in due course, it's clear that travel to The Maldives when permitted again will have a very different look and feel which might work for some, but not for all. Stay safe everyone."
"Just read this on FB and was slightly taken aback and personally would make me rethink the whole trip. I could understand maybe in the short term but many people stretch themselves for a one in a lifetime trip, couple that with financial pressures Covid 19 has out on many through furlough and lack of income and you can see a big % fall in tourism, but maybe that's what is wanted in the short term.Personally test on test and having to stay in my room would be enough to discourage me in the short term"
"this plan and the target market they have mentioned they want to open to first are in direct contradiction. they can’t seriously require a 14 day stay and also only want to reopen to countries like china and SK, which in average stay like 4 nights max! thankfully this i just a draft, nothing is set in stone. if they are serious about reopening, they will rethink this ..."
"Sounds like Sonu may have been lobbying the Government, sections of the report could have been taken from his article."
That makes for some interesting reading ar_perth.
Have just seen that the original article has been removed...maybe it caused too much negativity
Well it looks like that's the end of any possible desire to treat ourselves when this is all over with a 7th trip to the Maldives. We are not even starting to think about holidays at the moment and will wait until everything settles down properly (whatever the new 'properly' will look like). Could be in for a long wait.
"This was an initial draft as a basis for discussion among stakeholders in the tourism industry, it's not news or intended government policy at allPaula from Magic of Maldives"
Hi all. The article has been removed because if was not an official approved document. It was a draft that was circulated for feedback which is due next week. So there is nothing confirmed at this stage.
"Paula and William, that makes sense to me... obviously it got blown out of proportion and it doesn’t help that these media outlets continuously post these provocative articles which stir up all sorts of drama... most of which is entirely unfounded. It’s a waiting game - let’s see how long it takes for them to draft up something official."
It’s just a draft. Tourism NGOs are discussing with stakeholders for comments & recommendations. I’m sure government will consider our suggestions. Please share your suggestions to Community Tourism Organization. gam@gam.org.mv or WhatsApp to wa.me/9607792522
"MOT Mv has only shared a DRAFT of Safe Tourism Guidelines. Minister has requested Tourism NGOs to get the feedback from stakeholders & share with them for consideration. I’m pretty sure that many things need to change. We are receiving suggestions for VISA Fee, minimum stay period etc. Please share your comments to the Tourism Organizations in the Maldives. NasihPresidentCommunity Tourism OrganizationGam@gam.org.mv"
There is a group of General Managers and Resort Management Companies that are sending some clear feedback to the Tourism Ministry so that the plan and guidelines are more practical and will encourage guests to return to the Maldives as soon as possible. We are glad that something is in writing so we have a start. And that the Tourism Ministry is accepting feedback and prepared to evolve into an improved solution.
"I don't know if these measures are good or bad. What I do know is that we went to the Maldives 20 times and spent between 150 and 200 thousand euros in the total of those holidays that I took there.I canceled my April trip and I will probably have to cancel my September trip, both to Maldives and both booked before the pandemic.I don't know if they need me or need other tourists like me, but I know for sure that with these measures I will choose another destination where to spend my money."
There is no way that most of us can afford to stay for 2 weeks in maldives.. most of us in Asia usually only go for 3 to 5 nights or a week TOPS.To QT the first 48 hours in the room basically wipes out the entire holiday.I do not mind paying for the test in my home country before depature and proving it but to go there and be tested again? Plus all those restrictions? No way. The financial cost is just too high. Guess i will need to youtube my beach holiday fix if they do anything close to that draft.
"Jason - Thank you for your very thoughtful and helpful response. It is very reassuring that the final policy will reflect the input from the many knowledgeable resort professionals who care about the health of the industry and the well-being of their guests.Like all matters of public policy, the final policy will involve balancing many interests. Introducing various measures will appeal to some (by making the destination safer than other alternatives) and displease others (by adding inconvenience, cost, etc). The Maldives government will have a tough challenge to come up with a set of measures that optimises the health of the industry (critical for the country's economy), the health of its guests (inextricably linked to the health of the industry as many potential visitors will be put off by COVID19 outbreaks), and the health of its citizens.Good luck to you all with this monumental challenge.Bruce, Maldives Completewww.maldivescomplete.comEdited: 11:15 am, May 20, 2020 "
"for anyone wondering, here is an update on the situation based on the last press release done by the president: https://raajje.mv/79054 and https://en.sun.mv/60475it appears that:1. they will ease the lockdown as of 5/28, allowing maldivians to travel more freely in their own country. schools will also reopen.2. the government has cleared velana for reopening on 7/1 for leisure and business flight.3. the government is also allowing resorts to open as of 7/1.as of now, they haven’t mentioned any restrictions as to which countries willbe allowed in first, but based on my understanding it might be a general opening... we shall see what happens in the coming days.Edited: 4:22 pm, May 20, 2020 "
https:/…They have already waived the fees of visas and tests..hopefully other conditions will also be removed
"We’re looking to book our honeymoon to the Maldives. Have seen a great offer that’s only on until the 28th May so feeling a bit like time is against us!I know there’s no right or wrong answer here but am I crazy to be booking now for April 2021, will this have returned to more of a “normality” do we think.We’ll be coming from the U.K. for our honeymoon!"
"@lwraggI don't think you're crazy to book for April 2021, provided all your finances are in order. LOL.Unfortunately I rebooked our honeymoon as well for April 2021, and since then my husband has been furloughed. Probably only a 50/50 chance they will rehire, but won't know until August. And the airlines we were going to fly are getting rid of aircraft, etc. (although we have a 12.5 hour flight to middle east plus another 7 hours from there to MLE I believe).Anyway, I would *hope* things have settled down a bit by Apri l2021, but there's the possibility that things like buffets, travel (airlines especially) may put a damper on things, not to mention the economy. Over here in the US (especially New York) the economy is in the total toilet, so that's why I mention my unfortunate mistake (so that others can learn from my mistakes)."
"I too am looking at booking a holiday in January 2021...I am hoping it will be ok. But based on the mixed messaging by the gov't, I think I am going to look elsewhere. The only worse thing about a shut down is confusing/mixed messages by the leaders in charge. There is a lot of leeway on the hotel bookings in terms of cancellation....but what would I do with a $5K Emirates or Qatar airways credit (flying from the US)? The confusion is causing me to put on the brakes for a while for the Maldives."
Statement of the minister of tourism https:/…1Speaking of opening borders July. Stay Safe....
I suspect the resorts/countries which rely heavily on foreign tourism will have to take Cyprus's approach. Essentially indemnifying tourists where they can't get such indemnification through insurance currently.
I was surprised and relieved to read of the Cyprus approach - seems like a sensible and low cost idea.Richard from PurelyMaldives
They are suggesting now something like that. A bublle with the commonwealth https:/…
"While a bubble with the Comonwealth would be great for business, I am confused as to why Maldives would agree a bubble including India and the UK as opposed to Thailand ? What benefit is there of agreeing a bubble with such a vastly diverse Commonwealth as opposed to carefully selected individual countries with low incidences?Richard from PurelyMaldives"
"Oh gosh I’m sorry to hear about your experience. I’m quite fortunate in that I’m a teacher so my job is quite safe. My OH is head of operations at an airport and although he’s taken a pay cut we should be ok financially as we’ve been saving had for 18 months prior to this for our wedding/honeymoon!I hope things start to pick up soon in NYC, we love it there and that’s where we got engaged! My mum was due to come over this month but obviously won’t be able to now and she’s devastated!"
"I think for the average lay person its very easy to read the numbers and draw sweeping conclusions. As with previous pandemics, this will likely form the lifes work of some very gifted mathematicians. Academics and epidemiologists are still studying the Spanish Flu a century on and refining their models/data.It's unfortunate the reporting in the media has been so irresponsible and misleading. They're taken a kernel of truth and chucked away the cob because it doesn't fit in with their narrative. There's no more point comparing the UK/France/Italy to Germany as there is lambasting someone for being mauled by an escaped Lion because Usain Bolt managed to get away. Some countries came into this with an existing comparative advantage. Wether that be they had a large diagnostics industry. Or they'd been mauled by a Lion a couple of times before so had made bloody sure they were prepared (South Korea).Luck of the draw will also play a massive part in outcomes. If the initial infection is seeded in a densely populated area like London, then you're in far more trouble than if it's seeded in the sticks. Italy went into Lockdown pretty early, did it help them? No, because by the time you have rampant spread, stopping other people coming in isn't going to make much difference. What it will do is damage your economy further.It's easy to be Nostradamus after the fact. Think how many lockdowns we'd have had now (SARS-COV1, ZIKA, etc). Perhaps some really did know this was going to be different, I presume they are also multi millionaires now. Because if you had the foresight to predict SARS-COV2 was going to shutdown half the world, then surely you would have had the foresight to buy gold, bet against the airlines, etc, etc?We won't know the true numbers, who deserves a lambasting and why, for many years. Most (including the media) will of course have lost interest by the :/Edited: 11:20 am, May 28, 2020 "
"Unless there's a miracle, I think others will have to come around to Cyprus' approach. It's surely got to be cheaper to indemnify a small proportion of tourists. Rather then have sod all tourists. Particularly given they will only have to bare the cost of the services/goods. Rather then a tourist/insurer who'd be hit with the full marked up price of the hotel, healthcare, F&B, etc."
"It seems there is some plan already from the 1st of June.https:/…Guests can come to these tourist establishments either by private jet or superyacht from June 1, followed by charter and commercial flights a month later.Charter flights and private jets will be charged a landing fee of $50,000. Superyachts will also have pay an entry fee fo $10,000.Meanwhile, guesthouses and hotels will only be allowed to open from August.There are no plans yet to allow cruise ships.The tourism ministry expects the restrictions to be in effect until September “unless extended by the government”."
"Hi, whilst at some basic level that may make sense but what does an indemnity actually mean in real terms?...so hypothetically I arrive in the Maldives and am accepted into the country...I then develop symptoms (real or not) what then?...as I understand it I (and potentially anyone traveling with me) will be transferred to a quarantine island (so not allowed to stay in my 5* resort) and will have to accept frankly incredibly basic standards compared to in my case Australia...and if I end up really unwell then what, will the Maldivian Government pay to medivac me home, I doubt it...sorry but that is not an indemnity that works for me"
HiI need to change a booking for Costa Rica for July to next March - wanted to do Maldives but insurance is stopping me.Waiting on confirmation from insurance co but looks at the moment like if I change to Costa Rica March I would be covered for Covid but if I change destination not Covid covered!We could have vaccine or treatment or be able to get insurance cover by then but have to make the decision by the end of June.I don't think (as a mega worrier) I can book holiday without insurance.
"Semi-related:https://moorea.intercontinental.com/Wow, very sad. Wonder if we'll see similar permanent resort closures in Maldives?"
"I presume you know what indemnity means, you're just asking what it means in this context.Firstly the Maldives is not currently offering what Cyprus is. Here's a bit more detail about what Cyprus is offering:https:/…world-europe-52818749The highlight being:""Tourists ""will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight"".""""Officials also said a 100-bed hospital would be set aside specifically for tourists who test positive, as well as several so-called ""quarantine hotels"" for the patients' families.""WRT the Maldives taking your points one by one:1) Yes the medical facilities are rudimentary compared to what we're used to back home. But that has always been the case. If you'd caught Dengue you'd have ended up in those same facilities. I presume most people haven't only now discovered the likely outcome of becoming sick in the Maldives?2) Your probability of ending up in one of those facilities will of course have changed. And that is a pertinent factor. But it varies considerably from person to person. For example the risk for my kids has barely changed. For my wife and I the risk of suffering serious illness from COVID-19 is very small as well. If you're in a high risk demographic (certain illnesses, very old) then of course you may want to think again. But if not, then I don't think a holiday in the Maldives has suddenly become like entering a war zone. The risk factors are still in the same ball park.3) Financially, the risk of losing your money will probably have increased. I can see insurance premiums going up and many insurers removing pandemic cover. This is where Cyprus's approach makes sense. They can't eliminate the risk of getting sick. They couldn't do that before COVID-19 either. But they can replace the protection you would have been able to purchase through insurance and may not be able to do so now (for a while). In short, if you get sick, you'll get most of your money back.The issue is most people aren't rational in their appraisal of risk. It's often counter intuitive. Even for statisticians it's not something that comes naturally. Emotion, instinct, etc takes over. I still have that second of doubt getting on a plane, whilst I don't give a second thought to getting in my car. Yet I know the latter represents greater risk. Objectively, for most people, I think the increased risk will be marginal. Particularly if they indemnify you against on the ground costs (resort, medical, etc). But to entice some people back they will possibly have to go further. And like Cyprus set aside a decent Hotel and tourist specific medical facilities.Either way, it's going to be cheaper to cover the small proportion of guests who need those facilities, over having hardly anyone come back :("
