"After sadly having to postpone our trip to Japan in March 2020 we are hoping to go in March 2021 but recent news from Japan, querying whether Japan will be safe enough to host Olympics in July 2021 is throwing in doubt our rescheduled trip planned for 2021. Does anyone have any thoughts on safety of travel, due to Covid 19 in Spring 2021?"
"Nobody can foresee the future, but much more people are dying from COVID-19 in the UK than Japan.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"Yes, Japanese Government does not allow entry of people from UK now, and it seems to depend more on whether it allows the entry from UK until Spring 2012, although I hope it will.We have to expect the approval of effective drugs for the Covit-19 infection, such as Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences or Favipiravir (Avian) of Fuji Film in a few months. https:/…106354903https:/…2020.03.17.20037432v4"
"Logistics: you have to see whether the borders will be open and will be flights available. Travel risk: flights could be canceled, quarantine conditions could change.Health risk: if the outbreak subsides but no vaccine or effective treatment is developed by then, traveling could put you at risk.Bottomline: it's fine to plan. However, I would not book anything you can't cancel without penalties."
