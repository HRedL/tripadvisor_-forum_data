"Hi, my husband and I are planning to travel to Bali from the UK in September. We are hoping to experience as much as possible during our stay, including the Monkey Forest. My question is whether the rabies vaccination is advised before travelling, or whether most people just have the vaccine in Bali if they are scratched or bitten?TIA"
"Personally I have never bothered and have travelled to some pretty remote jungle locations. The rabies vaccine just buys you time to get the antidote rather immunise you against rabies. I think it gives you 72hrs to get hospital treatment compared to 24hrs. As long as you are sensible around wild animals,you should be fine. I always find this immunisation splits opinion, NHS doesn't advise as essential,rather optional."
"Hi Cathryn - been travelling to Bali for years and never bothered with it, even at the height of the rabies epidemic back in 2010."
"Thank you, that was my thoughts too but you've both put my mind at rest."
"Much as I love monkeys I avoid the monkey forest. People do get bitten there quite often and until recently Bali had NO rabies vaccines available for a couple of months. I watch them from the car on the way up north and they are as cute as ever. I avoid coming in to contact with dogs and cats too, for the same reason, no matter how cute or friendly. The small chance of being bitten is still enough for me not to want to go through treatment and cut my holiday short. And I'm a veterinary nurse, so no chicken around animals!"
"@kitten84 is right in that you still need treatment if you are bitten even if you have had the vaccine so I'd agree it's not really necessary. I do have some first hand experience as I got back from Bali 2 weeks ago and was in fact bitten by a monkey in the monkey forest in Ubud. I'm not telling you to scare you, just offering some advice. I was there with my husband and two daughters and we had a great time. There are plenty of guides around that you can chat to and there are signs which have guidelines to follow. The mistake I made was that after wandering around for nearly 2 hours without any problems at all I became complacent. We were just about to leave and we decided to sit down for a minute. There were no monkeys around and I stupidly popped my bag down next to me. A monkey appeared out of nowhere and grabbed it and I of course immediately snatched it back without even thinking. As I got up the monkey bit me on my side. So basically, you need to hold on to your belongings at all times!! It was a small straw bag with some wooden beads on top which a guide said probably looked like food. The guides told me it was nothing to worry about and that the monkeys don't have diseases but by the time I got back to our hotel and actually thought about what had happened I decided that I need to get it looked at. I went to a medical clinic nearby and they were fantastic. I had no idea how extensive the post exposure treatment would be. After they cleaned the bite I had 3 injections straight away (a tetnus and 2 rabies). I was also prescribed a course of antibiotics and anti viral medication which was 2 tablets - 5 times a day for 3 weeks, I've only just finished them! When I got back I had further treatment - rabies immogloblin which was injected straight into the bite area and then a further 2 lots of the rabies vaccine. All up I have had 8 injections in total. The actual bite was not that bad, there was no bleeding but the skin had been punctured so the treatment I was given is what is recommended by the World Health Authority. I am just glad that it happened to me and not one of my girls.The experience hasn't put me off the monkey forest and I wouldn't tell people to stay away, just to be very very cautious. The actual monkey forest is stunning and for the most part the monkeys are good value. I don't regret going, just regret putting my bag down!"
"Thanks RobTan, information is invaluable. The medical clinics in Bali can be excellent, or you may have just been given one shot, which is not enough for correct treatment."
