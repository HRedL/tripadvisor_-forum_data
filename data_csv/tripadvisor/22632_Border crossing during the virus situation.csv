We may need to make a trip to Vancouver in about a month.Any changes in the border crossing due to the virus?Thanks!
Hubby was asked if he had a fever when he crossed last week.
"Are you coming through a land crossing with Washington State, or via YVR airport?A lot can change in a month - no one can really predict what will happen."
"---“A lot can change in a month - no one can really predict what will happen.”---Until this past weekend, I was all about not putting life on hold because of this thing. I’m looking at it quite differently now.An interesting fact…in January, Vietnam closed its borders to citizens of China and Italy. Vietnam, one third the size of BC, with three times the population of Canada, has less than half the virus cases of Canada.A hmmmmm moment…when we run out of food, what will all those people do with a garage full of toilet paper?"
Thanks. We are driving up if we make the trip.
A few articles this week:https://bc.ctvnews.ca/u-s-expands-coronaviru…https:/…https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-colum…
"I went to Costco last night and stocked up on food for the freezer, dish soap and laundry soap (having checked that my hand soap supply was good). Couldn't have bought toilet paper if I'd wanted to! Of all the things to stock up on for a quarantine, that one makes no sense."
"The TP situation is so out of control, it’s hilarious!"
MuftiVancouver - thanks for the articles
"I read hand soap works amazingly well on the virus. I dont understand the run on the hand sanitizer.TP is even more ridiculous. I saw pictures of people with what looked like one year worth.May they want to stock up on stuff, perhaps canned food, milk powder, flour, pasta.Here are suggestions for TP replacement: https:/…"
"I don't remember Vietnam banning visitors from Italy, they're still allowed into Vietnam. Italy and the US both banned Chinese flights very quickly and that hasn't stopped the spread.The spread in Seattle is centered around a care home and in New York state where there's another cluster it's around a synagogue.The run on TP seems to be mainly a Costco thing? I saw lots of TP at Superstore today."
"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…Vietnam on Monday decided to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens from eight European countries amid growing concern over the coronavirus epidemic, its government said.The temporary suspension applied to citizens of Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain, the government said in a news release on its website.The country earlier halted visa-free travel for Italian and South Korean over the virus concern."
"Vietnam's own people are not great travellers - that makes a fairly significant difference IMO. It is easy to ban foreign visitors from infected countries, but it's a different can of worms stopping your own citizens retuning from Asian cruises and trips to Italy. It is prime sun-destination travel in North America, plus school trip season.Calipiggy - if there was a big increase in the cases in Washington State there *might* be a delay/health check/ stop at the land crossings into BC - but this is a large frontier with numerous crossings. There would be nothing to stop a visitor such as yourself swinging east and entering this country through Idaho or Montana/Alberta. Do make sure you have the best travel medical insurance possible...and wait and see."
"""The run on TP seems to be mainly a Costco thing? I saw lots of TP at Superstore today.""I was in a Thrifty's grocery store in Victoria last week... there had definitely been a run on TP there."
Last Friday driving over from BC to Washington at Sumas they asked if I had traveled to China.
@zephyr18Are you using a passport for you going back and forth? I would have thought that it would show up in a passport when you travel overseas.
Things are changing quickly. The NHL is cancelling the rest of the season. The PGA will go on but without spectators starting tomorrow. London Drugs had lots of TP yesterday but the price had almost doubled. We are seeing a panic like reaction and it feels a little overblown but like after 911 there’s nothing anybody can do about it. I was going to fly back east in June but have pulled the plug on that. Until we know more about the virus I’m sticking close to home and avoiding crowds. I might have to buy a bottle of tequila because they’re all out of hand sanitizer ;)
Funny - was just at London Drugs in Calgary and their TP was on sale! Plus they had lots.
"""I might have to buy a bottle of tequila ""That may sound funny but there are reports of i di ots that have tried using booze and got food poisoning - so NOT funnyand probably a good thing sanitizers are out because when you do not use them correctly they offer a false sense of security."
"cbaarch, I use a NEXUS card."
Sorry. I should’ve put /sarc after my post. I wasn’t suggesting to drink lots of tequila to try to kill the virus. Just saying it (or any kind of alcohol) would work just as well as a hand sanitizer. But what a waste !
"Just saying it (or any kind of alcohol) would work just as well as a hand sanitizernot accurate - according to everything I have read including this article on the US CDC web site, a sanitizer needs to be at least 60% alcohol to kill the virus. https:/…prevention.html"
"Lighten up ! It was a petite joke and you’ve ruined it ! If you want to be fearful, that’s ok. Not me."
"We are booked to fly into Calgary in May from UK, making our way via Banff and Rocky Mountaineer to Vancouver and V Island. We should have been going on to Seattle but that's no longer possible because of USA new rules. Does anyone think it likely that Canada will also refuse entry to flights from UK or like New Zealand, require us to go into quarantine for 2 weeks? I can't get any sense of how things are in Canada, although after reading previous posts, you seem to be having the same experiences in shops that we are having in UK. We've had this trip planned for about a year and if it's a definite No No, we should be able to get money back from insurance and look towards planning it for another time."
@cocconbarbieThe advice from everywhere seems to be changing often; if not daily. At this point I would go with Plan A and let the airlines cancel your flights based on what direction Canada will have at that time. That way you get your money back and you can have a chance of collecting on your Travel Cancellation insurance if you booked non refundable hotels etc...
May is an eternity away. Relax.
#24.Today's National Post printed this article an hour or so ago. The PM and Cabinet will be meeting today to discuss what to do about further travel restrictions if anything.https://tinyurl.com/vo99hme
