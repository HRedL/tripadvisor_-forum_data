Hello: I live in the US but I also have an Irish passport. Is it possible to take the SARS-CoV-2 test on arrival to show you are safe to enter the country? Or would I have to take the test in the US before I leave? Thanks.
"please read the requirements as repeated on nearly every coronavirus topoic over the last few days. it does not matter where your passport is from, but where you are actually arriving from., and where you normally residse"
You cannot travel to Austria at all https:/…current-travel-information
"The regulations are not written like that though - they mention nationality, not residency as in:""2.1 ENTRY FROM OUTSIDE THE EU AND THE SCHENGEN AREAAustria has suspended the entry of third-country nationals (non-EU/EEA/CH citizens), including U.S. citizens, entering Austria from outside the EU and the Schengen area. ""I am an EU citizen."
"Depends where you are coming from. Your TA details show you are from Denver, Colorado. The EU citizenship is new information.The rule you quote is for entry from outside the EU - if you are currently residing within the EU then this rule does not apply to you. If you currently live outside of the EU then it does apply to you.The virus incidence is not influenced by your nationality but by the location of where you live.Edited: 10:23 am, July 12, 2020 "
"Ps - like everyone on here, this is just my opinion. If you are an EU citizen coming from outside the EU I would suggest you contact the Austrian Embassy in your current country of residence for legal clarification."
Let’s apply a bit of common sense. Austria does not want anyone entering the country if they were recently in a highly infected country like the US. The colour or style of a passport is irrelevant. The more people ignore the rule and find ways to circumvent it then the worse the situation will become for everyone.
"The problem is that often the rules are not clear. As an example the rule quoted above is from an Austrian Government website. I appreciate the intention is to prevent travellers visiting from the US. However, the rule refers to non-EU/EEA/CH citizens - not non-EU/EEA/CH residents."
""" The regulation applies only to people who are residents in the listed countries or Austrian citizens. It is also a prerequisite that you have not been in any country other than Austria or those European countries in the past  14 days.""i think that the above is perfectly clear !"
"This is why I think their is confusion. The OP is currently living in US - the following is the entire rule shown on the Austrian Embassy Website in Washington - regarding entry from outside the EU.2.1 ENTRY FROM OUTSIDE THE EU AND THE SCHENGEN AREAAustria has suspended the entry of third-country nationals (non-EU/EEA/CH citizens), including U.S. citizens, entering Austria from outside the EU and the Schengen area. Exceptions apply i.a. for:Transit Passengers﻿Family members of Austrian (and EU/EEA/CH) citizens living in the same household ﻿Holders of a D visa or residence permit issued by AustriaMembers of diplomatic missions and employees of international organizations (including their family members living in the same household)Those exempted Individuals will only be allowed to enter Austria upon presentation of a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular-biological SARS-CoV-2 test. The certificate must be issued by a licensed medical practitioner in German or English and must not be older than 4 days at the time of entry.Persons who cannot produce the required medical certificate will be denied entry into Austria or be subject to 14-day quarantine at home (self-monitored) or at an appropriate location that must not be left for the duration of the quarantine. A negative molecular-biological test conducted and presented during the quarantine will end it and the location can be left. Individuals are responsible for covering the cost of the quarantine accommodation; at the time of entry a confirmation of the availability of such an accommodation to the individual must be presented, otherwise entry will be denied. Individuals transiting Austria without stop are not subject to the above entry restrictions."
"And from Austrian Embassy New York website2. Travel to Austria COVID-19 - RELATED ENTRY RESTRICTIONS FOR TRAVELERS TO AUSTRIA (Valid until September 30, 2020)2.1 ENTRY FROM OUTSIDE THE EU AND THE SCHENGEN AREAThere are no entry bans for Austrian, EU, EEA or Swiss citizens to enter Austria.However, Austria has suspended the entry by third-country nationals, including U.S. citizens, from outside the EU and the Schengen area already since mid-March 2020."
Obviously No Ban does not equal No Quarantine or Test Requirement
"The rule is for entry from Countries that aren’t in the EU/Schengen. A US citizen resident in Germany, say, will be entering from a Schengen country so is OK. A German arriving from the US is OK. A US citizen arriving from the US isn’t allowed in."
"sorry, but i cannot see any confusion in what i quoted above. to me, it is perfectly clear. the poster does not comply so that irrespective of passport, he has to have the test unless he has been resident in the eu for the previous 14 days (provable )"
"2nd reply suggests that he cannot travel to Austria at all.I think that the Austrian Government may wish to ban all US residents but they are probably not allowed to ban EU citizens.Most of us agree that he can travel but he has to comply with the negative test or complete the quarantine period, based in his US residency."
"Yes, I am happy to comply with any requirements like testing and quarantining. Masks etc."
Please see point 2.1 of this document https:/…current-travel-information
Any idea why Austrian Airlines is still offering flights to Vienna given these documents. Surely the flights are not full of EU members? Minimally they should be declaring clearly who shouldn't be flying.
"I should have said ""offering so many flights ..."""
"Point 2.1 does not impact on original poster as he is an E.U. citizen.The E.U. is unable to ban its own citizens, regardless of where they live! Even if it might wish to.They can put in a quarantine requirement.Edited: 1:49 am, July 14, 2020 "
"PS Although that info is not clear in his original post he does confirm it in post number 3Edited: 1:54 am, July 14, 2020 "
