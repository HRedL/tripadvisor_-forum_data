"Hi,We're planning to visit Poland in August, for about 10 days, a couple with a 5 year old kid. I thought it could be a good idea to start from the Czech republic and then cross to Poland. What I am looking for is not big cities, but rather small towns or villages with great views. I don't expect we'll be hiking much with our son, but I do like walks and nature (as long as we're all comfortable, there is internet connection, and medical help if needed :) ). We had visited Szczyrk, Poland couple of years ago, and had lots of fun - so I am looking to visit several spots like this, on the trail between the Czech republic and Poland - to stay 2-3 days in each and then move on to the next. What would be the advisable route?I thought we should rent a car, but if it is not a good idea I would appreciate to know the better alternatives."
"I recommend to rent a car. You may do this route: Marianske Lazne (totally not crowded comparing to Karlovy Vary and much more compact and coherent architecture), Loket, Kutna Hora (St. Barbara's church, ossuary), Liberec (town hall), Rudawy Janowickie (colorful lakes), Karkonosze National Park (Wodospad Kamieńczyka, Śnieżne Kotły), Wałbrzych (Książ Castle), Świdnica (church of peace, cathedral), Jawor (church of peace), Lubiąż (abbey), Kudowa Zdrój (Błędne Skały, Szczeliniec, Park Zdrojowy, Teplicke Skaly), Wambierzyce (church), Lądek Zdrój (Wojciech thermal pool), Moszna Castle, Wrocław (only the ZOO with a new Afrykarium if you don't like big cities).Marianske Lazne with Loket - 1,5-2 daysKutna Hora - 1/2 dayLiberec - 3 hoursRudawy Janowickie - 3 hoursKarkonosze - (Wodospad Kamieńczyka, Śnieżne Kotły) 1 dayKsiąż Castle - 3 hoursŚwidnica - 3 hoursJawor - 1 hourLubiąż - 1,5 hoursKudowa Zdrój (with Błędne Skały, Szczeliniec Wielki, Park Zdrojowyj) - 1 dayTeplicke Skaly - 3 hoursWambierzyce - 1 hourLądek-Zdrój - 2-3 hoursMoszna Castle - 2 hoursAfrykarium - 2 hours, whole ZOO - 8 hoursYou may omit some of longer hikes with a child and Błędne Skały (45 minutes), Szczeliniec hikes (1,5 hours) are short but beautiful.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I think Krynica Górska may be something your son will enjoy. Other options:Kazimierz Dolny and the area nearby,Mazury - especially the area of lake Nidzkie (Ruciane Nida - search for a thread started a few days ago about Mazury / Warmia / Olsztyn)."
"Thanks! Are these all in Szech republic? I guess we would like to spend about 5 days there before crossing the border.By the way, is there really measles epidemic in that area as the press is saying?"
