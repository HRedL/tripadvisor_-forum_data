"""A two-hour series season finale will air on April 3""https:/…"
Suspected this would be the last season. Will miss the show. One of our top favs.
Darn! One of my favorites too! I'll miss it.
(So how old will we be when they bring it back for the 3rd time?)
"Yea, you're right BLBL! Maybe they could reboot Baywatch (for the 3rd time?) , before my eyesight starts to fail."
"Caddy!My daughter is one of the Polynesian dancers in the opening credits of Baywatch Hawaii. She is also one of the Polynesian dancers in a Baywatch episode called, ""The Hunt""!Season 10, episode 9.She is the one in purple in the credits for all episodes and in purple in ""The Hunt"". If you blink, you will miss her un the credits. Perhaps 2-3 seconds in ""The Hunt""!"
Maybe episode 10 instead of 9.I'm finding both in my searches!
Maybe they will have the whole cast get COVID-19 and die in the finale................
"In my mind I always knew this day would come. In my heart I hoped it never would. Like many others, I’ve watch every episode since season 1. The episode that sticks in my mind was the Thanksgiving episode written by Chi McBride aka Lou Grover. It made me laugh. Do any other fans of the show feel that Magnum can fill the void ?"
I'm not much of a fan of the new Magnum! I do watch it only because it is in Hawaii.I hope they have somewhat of a good ending to Hawaii Five-0! I don't care what the ending is as long as it is a good ending! MASH and Cheers had good endings!I hate watching a TV show for years and without an ending the show is cancelled.But it appears that Hawaii Five-0 will have a good ending as it is a two hour episode that will end it!
Oh shoot! We really enjoyed watching the show!
Here you go Dusty! I saw her...just a flash.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9CNWqQXdGkLet's hope in Hawaii Five-O III they don't pick an Aussie for Steve. :)
"5-0 was good until they ditched all their Fab Asian stars, it went straight downhill from there.. Let's GO Magnum!!"
We have watched 5-0 from the beginning. We will be on Oahu in two days at HHV. Is there anyway to find out when and where they will be filming?
I quit watching when Daniel Dae Kim left.
Robin V: I think there are only 3 episodes left ti air in this final season. Which likely means all filming is already complete.
"Hunt, they know full well of your magnificence. :)"
"We enjoyed the show, but I was expecting cancellation 3 years ago and the writing quality has definitely gone down hill. But we still watching it religiously, every week.Now the question is, how long with Magnum PI last."
I watched the first season of 5-0 but quickly lost interest . I didn't watch the Magnum reboot when it premiered only because I was such a fan of the original growing up. Finally got around to watching a couple of episodes and its actually not too bad.
"I wanted to love them. We still re-watch the original series. But this one was too cutesy and jumped the shark years ago. DH watches it, I websurf. Last episode was pretty good."
April 3rd is only a month away.March 20 and March 27 are on Fridays and will likely be on CBS (at least on March 20) and will likely have NCAA Men's basketball tournament on.They may change Hawaii Five-0 to a different night each weekend. But only 3-5 episodes left including the last 2 hour episode!
"I have Richard Sullivan's book, ""Driving and Discovering Oahu, Honolulu & Waikiki"". Very nice book! So are a lot of other books and so are the free magazines at the airport baggage claim areas and magazine racks all over Waikiki!I do like his free link to movie and TV locations on Oahu:discoveringhawaii.com/Driving_and_Discoverin…"
Next week Friday!
Bump for tomorrow!
Great show...until Kono and Chin left.
"Dusty, tomorrow April 3, 2020 when the new Five-O ends, will truly be a ALOHA FRIDAY! :)I just wanted to mention the broadcast time: ""Hawaii Five-0, the popular Friday night crime drama, will conclude its successful 10-season run with a series finale, Friday, April 3rd at 9:00 PM ET on CBS"""
"I think that this last episode will reveal that Dano is really the love child of McGarrett’s mom, and Wo Fat??Just thinking here,Hunt"
"Be careful there Braddah Hunt! All is quarantined and we don't want no ""spoilers"" so that eveybody watch and CBS make da money.Alright! Ya don't have to pull so hard on my spandex!Tomorrow night's episode will reveal that ""Caddyshackman"" is the long lost Grandson of Larry Ellison, and the sole heir to the Island of Lana'i!Please watch anyway, just so you can see handsome Mr. Caddy. I do look good, no? :)"
"Hope they arrest all the murders and international terrorists on Oahu before the show ends. I keep teasing the wife, we can't return to Hawaii because of ""all the crime"". :) That doesn't seem to deter her."
Bump
"I expected a two hour ending that was mentioned in the article.Early today, TV guide on my TV showed only one hour, so I knew either the article or the TV Guide was wrong.It was a decent (not great) ending that was only one hour."
When March madness was cancelled they decided to split up the 2 hour finale into 2 -1 hour shows. Sad it ended.
I sort of expected a bit more from last night's episode. Though the end did make me teary. Everyone saying goodbye.
"Yes, we were expecting 2 hrs, and I had not looked at Guide, so was a bit surprised at only 1 hr.Watched our early news, finished our wine, and went to bed.Hunt"
"I missed most of the HOUR for a couple of reasons (and was exciting two hours as you all said). But then ""Blue Bloods"" came on. And I wondered by none of the entire Reagan cop family talked about the Corona virus; just NYC crime! :)"
"Watched the last episode last night.Now what am I to do, no visit to Hawaii this year and no more Hawaii Five-O. How will I get my Hawaii fix? So sad."
Magnum P.I. starts back up again on Friday. So there's that.
Yup Magnum PI. I watched both of them just for the background scenes of Hawaii. I realized during the sad farewells at the end of the lasts episode that I hadn't really been following along! :) Still will miss that theme song and opening credits/shot!
"The old Magnum P.I. is on one of the Hallmark Channels on weekdays (I think). It's got this guy who has thick eyebrows; winks them, and wears Hawaiian shirts and skimpy shorts. Watch for him; I think he might have a future as an actor. :)"
"I'm glad Hawaii Five-0 got an actual ending, rather than just not getting renewed in the offseason. But the ending, like most of the last few years, was a little flat. But hey, it was a great run and we certainly kept coming back.Magnum PI has been quite a fun reboot, for me. I grew up on the original (original H50 was a little before my TV habit) and in my head the bar was high. Even though I was not impressed with the new magnum, in promos, I've come to really enjoy the show. They've done a nice job of re-imagining it, I love the new Higgens, Magnum has grown into his own character, and the easter eggs, guest stars, and other fan servicing things have all been well done. I hope it continues on after this season ends!"
We can't get Magnum PI here in Aus unless it is through some dodgy website.
