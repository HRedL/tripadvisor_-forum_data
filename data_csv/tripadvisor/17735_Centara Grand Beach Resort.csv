We are thinking of holiday in Krabi (heard it is pretty). We are thinking of booking into the Centara Grand Beach Resort and would like to hear travellers views on the resort and the beach for safe swimming.We like a clean beach with clear waters.Can we get this here?
Hi - The beach will be clean - the hotel maintain it.We have been past the beach in a boat but have not sat on it.It looked really nice.The waters off Aonang are not crystal clear like the Barrier Reef Islands - the waters on the tiny outter lying islands are more beautiful for swimming. As the Centara is just around from Aonang the advice is the same re swimming - ie same conditions water wise.We still enjoyed the beach because it is quiet spectacular and the views along the beach and out towards the islands are stunning. Don't stress about this too much - you will enjoy it.When we did a package day trip to the Hong Islands we were hardly out of the water all day - it was beautiful.Caroline.
"Hi holiday2011,We have just returned from the Centara and had a wonderful time. Like Caroline said the beach is clean but the water is not crystal clear but having said that we enjoyed swimming and didn't find it to be a problem. The water is quite shallow and calm which I loved. At low tide it felt like you could walk out for miles!The hotel's location is really its selling point. The views from the beach are beautiful. It is located on it's own private beach and is only accessible by boat, walking the monkey trail (fun!) or by walking through the water at low tide. The hotel is really well laid out, pool area is lovely. Rooms were spacious, we had a sea view room and the view was amazing. There were 7 of us traveling together and everyone really enjoyed it.If you have any specific questions just fire them at me!Loucie"
Hi LoucieThanks so much for your up to date comments on the Centara Grand.Sounds a delightful holiday. Will be in touch if I have any more queries.
"Hi Loucie, we will be staying at the Centara in a few weeks and wonder if we have chosen the right room, a premium sea view. do you know how much it is to buy into the Club on arrival and would it be worth it, e.g. Where is the club lounge, does it have an outdoor terrace , sea views etc."
"Hi Ka_bee,We booked with trailfinders and included club lounge in the package so I am not sure if you can decide to upgrade on arrival, I'm sure you can. It worked out at about 20 Euro a day each extra for us. I'd be in two minds as to whether or not it is really worth it, it really depends on how much you use it. The lounge itself is a nice airy comfortable room with a small outdoor terrace but it does not have sea views. it is just off the lobby area so is at ground level so no real views to speak off. They serve a continental style breakfast there but we never used this, we always preferred to go to the main restaurant as there was such a better choice.At lunchtime they serve soup and bread rolls followed by afternoon tea and little cakes and in the evening from about 5-7pm they have canapes and cocktails, wine & beer. You can also call in there at any time during the day and stock up on bottles of water instead of buying them at the pool bar! So if you were to use it every day you would certainly get your money's worth. But in the evening we preferred to have a drink at the bar on the beach and watch the sunset rather than having to walk up to the lounge ""away from it all"" Our room was really lovely and we had a fabulous view. We also had free wifi as part of the club package which was really handy and 2 pieces of laundry free per day. So if you think you will use it then I would recommend it. Any other questions just ask.Loucie"
Thanks for the reply . I' m really not sure as we do plan to go out a lot in the day as well as explore the local restaurants at night.
Well to be honest then i probably wouldn't bother with the club lounge as you won't get the value out of it and if you are out all day you won't get the use out of it. I believe that you will still enjoy centara without the club class. It really is a beautiful hotel. Sitting in a cold Dublin on a saturday night I am very envious of you planning your trip!
"Hey Ka-Bee!Hey Loucie!I appreciated your dialogues about the club lounge, because we are going to stay at Centara from 2nd to 10th of April and we were wondering about all that stuff- should we book the club lounge or not, is it worth it, a.s.o.When are you staying at Centara Ka-bee- or is your holiday already over?Greetings from ""cold"" Austria.Julie"
"We will be at the Centara next week, still undecided about the Club lounge!"
"We only visited via the jungle/cliff/monkey walk. That was a slight challenge in itself (although I am afraid of heights!). The beach was nice, better than round the corner in Ao Nang. Water relatively shallow and felt sheltered and safe. Plenty of opportunities for boat rides out for the day and Railay beach isn't far away either."
"I did a search on the Centara Grand in these forums and there was some talk of an illness epidemic last year, and some suggestion that the monkeys at the resort spread disease. I am wondering if illness is still a problem there?"
"We are just back from our stay at the Centara.It is a beautiful hotel, very clean and excellent restaurants. I didn't hear of anyone being ill at all.The monkeys were the highlight of our stay, we loved to watch them from our balcony, a really unique experience. You will love it!"
"Was it difficult getting to and from Centara? Can you only go via speedboat, or are there also longtails outside Centara?"
"We didn't find it difficult at all. We booked the speed boats the day before, but if we changed our minds and wanted to come back earlier there was always room on the boat in the evening. Some days we walked around the rock at low tide and watched the sunset at the Last Fisherman before going for dinner in town. We took the monkey trail a few times, it isn't hard but you do get a bit hot and sweaty! You can get long tails back from the beach in Ao Nang if you pay.Just another plus- when we had the Tsunami scare the staff were excellent, we were well looked after and felt totally safe."
What was the situation like at Centara Grand during the tsunami warning? Care to share your experience?
"YES YES , read my review of that resort , it schold anserw your cuestion"
