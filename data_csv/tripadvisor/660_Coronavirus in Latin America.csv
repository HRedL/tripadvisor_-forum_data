"Argentina has begun implementing precautionary measures to fight the spread of coronavirus, after Brazil confirms Latin America's first case of the disease and the number of confirmed cases in Italy continues to grow.https://bit.ly/2T59dKpToday Health Minister Ginés González García stated: “We are going to apply a different protocol to passengers who come from Italy. They will land on a different platform and there they will have different controls. They will also sign an affidavit saying that they have not felt any kind of symptoms.”Every week, 12 direct flights from Italy arrive at Ezeiza. An additional number of passengers arrive weekly from the same European destination via connections, particularly through Spain or Brazil."
"hi,We should simply do the things we usually should do:keep the hands clean, don't cough with open mouth etc. and everything is gonna be good."

It seems unlikely that Argentina's neighbor Uruguay has no coronavirus cases.Countries that do little or no testing can appear to be free of the disease.https://bit.ly/3cTCKOK
"Uruguay’s Ministry of Health confirmed the country’s first four cases on March 13. In all four cases, the patients had traveled to Milan and entered Uruguay between March 3 and 6."
"Unrecognized, milder cases of COVID-19 are likely the driving force behind the rapid spread of the virus throughout the world, a new study suggests.People with recognized infections were sicker and more contagious. They are the ones who got and largely followed orders to isolate themselves from others.86% of infections were mild enough that people didn’t seek medical care or confirmation of their symptoms. These milder cases were only about half as contagious as the recognized infections, but because there were so many more of these undocumented cases than the documented ones, the unrecognized cases were the ones fanning the flames of the outbreak.https://wb.md/2IYN6zo"
"You wonder if, at some point, wake up and take your temperature would be good hygiene to teach kids along with wake up and brush your teeth. Or at least take your temperature any time you feel a bit off. And then behave conservatively until you sort that out."
Winter is coming: cooler South America weather could fan coronavirus spread:https://reut.rs/2WxmfCl
"The governments of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, countries involved in the Forum for South American Progress (PROSUR), have agreed to work closely together to contain the coronavirus pandemic.Venezuela has been excluded from the process.According to the Chilean government, the agreements include ""coordinated and effective protection"" of the borders of the member countries and control of the flow of people.The return of citizens to their respective countries is to be simplified. These measures are intended to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus, said Chile."

Update: Coronavirus cases in Argentina:https://bit.ly/34DITuN
"MonteCD,,,,thanks for complete report,,,, very interesting to see the evolution of the pandemic and to know the health and economical situation in each country.."
"Latin America coronavirus cases pass 300,000:https://bit.ly/2WcoMBoIn Argentina, more than 5,300 confirmed cases and 282 deaths."
Argentina appears to have successfully flattened the curve of the coronavirus.https://bit.ly/3coAL4y
"While I agree with most of that Guardian article, and applaud what Fernandez has done in Argentina, it sadly isn't true that we've flattened the curve yet. Yes, the number of cases and deaths has remained thankfully and impressively low, but if you look at the charts plotting number of daily cases, it is shooting up. Here is a chart comparison of countries around the world, with the numbers coming from Johns Hopkins. https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries…Of course, with a low number of cases you will notice a small bump immediately. I'm guessing that the upturn at the end of April represents the sudden spread into the villas of Buenos Aires. Personally, I'm not thrilled with the openings that the mayor of Buenos Aires has laid out for this week. There were already many more people on the street in San Telmo yesterday and mask usage was much more haphazard than a week ago."
I agree very much with you Sylvie2.We have low positive case numbers but we also have very low testings so far.The exponencial growth from Villas and less favorable neighbourhoods will continue unless every body on those areas gets promptly tested.Cheers!

"Thanks, Monte. Very sobering numbers.For those who want to get a better picture of Argentina, go to the Johns Hopkins Covid site:https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlClick on Argentina from the list on the left. Then click on ""Daily Cases"" on the bottom right. You will see the trend graphically. If you do the same for Uruguay, you can see the way we would have hoped the chart to look."
"Sylvie,I wish we looked more like Uruguay indeed, but our demographics are completely different, not to mention our geographical extension and diversity. They create a logistic and structural challenge.The main failure I see in the way Argentina's Goverment is handling the issue today is the amount of daily tests done (we have been doing about 2.5/3k daily tests for the past three weeks). We should be doing at least 10k per day to have a better picture of the situation that is concentrated, mostly, in Buenos Aires city and the metro-suburban area.Thanks Monte and Silvie for your input and collaboration."
"Oh, I totally agree about Uruguay, Jorge! I didn't mean to imply that Uruguay was doing a better job than Argentina. As you said, their situations aren't comparable. I only meant that after shutting down sooner than our neighbors, we had hoped that our daily number of new cases would be going down. Instead, yesterday we recorded the highest number of new infections since the pandemia started. Now that we have developed our own test, hopefully there will be more widespread testing and tracking. But an equally serious mistake, IMO, was not paying attention to the marginal, impoverished parts of the city. Allowing Villa 31 to go without water for 12 days has had a devastating impact."
"Yes, Sylvie, I agree with you our Government did not do much to prevent that...Unfortunately today's numbers are even worse."
"Uruguay has kept rates of the coronavirus at one of the lowest levels in Latin America:https://reut.rs/2yGfjtdUruguay’s neighbors like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia have far higher rates of infection."
"MonteCD keep in mind that Uruguay has a total population slightly bigger than Buenos Aires City alone. They have done more testing per population and done a much better job at containing the cases. At the beginning here in Argentina (early March), the Health Ministry only asked for a paper signed declaration upon arrival stating that one had no symptoms...A long way to go from there indeed. I'm glad for Uruguay!Edited: 9:10 am, May 28, 2020 "
Latin America now accounts for 40% of daily coronavirus deaths:https://bloom.bg/3gyQhgG
"Monte, and the worse is still to come..."
"Sadly, I think you are correct Jorge. I just picked up the CNN piece re Covid19 in Latin America https:/…index.html . Pretty scary!Clearly Latin America is behind the curve of the rest of the world in the spread of this disease and yet countries still don’t appear to be learning the lessons of mistakes of other countries which have , or are still going through it, or indeed what they have got right, in dealing with this pandemic. Even in my own country, the UK which has one of the largest and most developed public health systems in the world, we have struggled. Without that sort of public health infrastructure I fear for the people of Latin America. Yet we still see people asking on these forums whether it will be ok to travel in June, July etc. I cant see any tourism related travel to Latin America in any meaningful form for a long time yet. Sadly, few governments and governments around the world seem to have got a grip on dealing with this. Too many politicians and too little leadership.."
"So true, Crellston ""Too many politicians and too little leadership.."" almost universally. Hoping and praying for an end to this pandemic and a restoration (creation ?) of sanity in the politics. Stay well.Edited: 10:06 am, May 31, 2020 "
"Marnie and Crellston, indeed if one looks at the last few days numbers, we clearly see that most of our Latin American countries had cases peak, and some, daily death toll peaks as well. That can only mean we are accelerating to the worse part of the curve. And as you said, our health systems are in no way comparable to those in Europe or the US.For as much as I can't tolerate staying at home any longer (72 days now and counting...) it's really important that people in general understand the importance to reduce unnecesary contact with others as much as possible, keeping oneself sanitized every time you go out and come back for whatever reason, maintaining social distancing, and also wearing a face-mask. Sadly, one also has to avoid any possible travel plans at least until September, where we should start to see a decline of the disease.Cheers to both, and stay healthy!"
"The main problem in Latin America is the poverty that has made the precariousness with which the population lives. It is very difficult to maintain social distancing where people live crowded and where they live day to day and the lockdown leaves them without income because they have precarious jobs. The increase in cases has been characterized by people in poor neighborhoods, such as Barrio 31 in Buenos Aires or La Pintana neighborhood in Santiago, favelas in Sao Paulo or suburbs in Lima. The health pandemic goes hand in hand with the social pandemic, that is why the statistical dramatics of the last days are seen"

"Thank you, Jorge. This updates are very informative."
"You are welcome Reise. MonteCD posted it first, very informative indeed!"
"Yes, we are appreciative of MonteCD's starting this thread here and on the UY Forum - and for keeping it current. Gracias Monte.Edited: 10:00 am, June 02, 2020 "
"Today, Argentina hit a sad 25 dead toll daily record.The metro area including Buenos Aires City, Greater Buenos Aires (Province of Buenos Aires) and some portions of Chaco, Rio Negro, Cordoba and Chubut will continue on a quarantine until june 28th. The rest of the country enters a new phase of ease down restrictions."

"Monte, it is indeed a big concern on how all this extended lockdown will impact negatively on our already suffering economy. The situation is somehow contained (although new records of daily new cases and deaths have been set in the past few days), but the ""return"" plan in terms of economic stimulous is far from being completely outlined."

"Despite political divisions and an economic crisis, Argentina has kept coronavirus cases comparatively low.https://bbc.in/2Oly7BX"
"Thank you once again, Monte...a very interesting albeit painful article. The Brazilian response is not totally unlike that of my own USA approach. And bravo for UY....I hope Argentina comes thru with better statistics soon....the portenos have been under serious quarantine for sooo long."
"Marnie: "" the Porteños have been under serious quarantine for sooo long"" - 115 days and not a chance this will end in the near future. VERY, very hard!"
"It's been very hard but even if the numbers don't get much better (as everyone here hopes for, including the local Government) come July 18th a new phase will most likely start for the city of Buenos Aires (unless a sudden peak of cases and hospitalizations arise). Let's keep our fingers crossed for the better outcome of all this situation!"
"What do you think the chances are of being able to book a holiday this year for anytime between Jan - March 2021? I normally book 6 months in advance.British Airways have flights available and are quite affordable for January 2021.Edited: 2:27 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"Hola TravelAddict: my DH and I are asking ourselves (and anyone else who will listen) the same question. We generally book 9-12 weeks in Argentina or Monte and BsAs. Last year was so great,..,keep looking at the photos, etc. But we left BsAs biting our nails hoping for a flight home.  We are hoping for January to March this year....no way to tell at this point, I suppose. Nerve wracking, no ?"
"@Traveladdict: of course it is impossible to say what will happen between July 2020 and Jan-March 2021, but I tend to be not that pessimistic.....I mean we are talking about half a year from now, I really cannot imagine Argentina being in lockdown still by then you know, that would be impossible to manage. First of all domestic and intercontinental flights will have to operate again, once that is the case (for now foreseen in September 2020) I presume tourism will start up very slowly again. This year might be lost, but lets think positive and focus on 2021 to be a fresh start, please............"
"I would be also more positive and would think that come January or Feb 2021 your intended trip should happen. If you decide to buy something (be it hotel, air fare, etc) make sure you get everything refundable and/or with flexible terms (change dates, etc).Of course it is impossible to tell right now, but I would wait at least until September 1st to see if the Argentinian Goverment effectively resumes and allows some sort of traveling in/out of the country with the specific new regulations in place. Cheers!"
"I'm optimistic about Argentina opening up to tourists come September. Tickets for flights are being sold and although this doesnt mean it's not guaranteed it's also worth noting that the world will continue. Argentina's economy is crippled and an injection of tourist money will definitely help. Although lifes are more important than money at the end there will have to be a balance, and my bet is it will open in September. Slowly and carefully obviously. That's just me being optimistic."
"Dont book anything right now anyway. Tens of thousands of people are waiting for an eventual refund of flight tickets,..."
"Thanks for replies. Nice to read positive news! I have done all my planning, 3 weeks would consist of BA, Salta, Puerto Iguazu, and a day trip to Uruguay. Fingers crossed then"
