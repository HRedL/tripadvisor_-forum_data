I have searched but do like to get the ear on the ground ...Are visitors allowed from uk now ? (Think we have only to self isolate on return to uk for 14 days)How is lockdown affecting say koh san road ?All the sites open?Planning a spontaneous open ended travel marathon .....
"Look at the UK Foreign Office travel advice website Jules. You will read that, indefinitely, you will not be allowed to travel to Thailand.Maybe next year?"
Cheers. Greece island hopping it is then ... and hopefully Thailand will be open again by january 2021.(I do look at the uk site but it is barely in clear english so have to double check.)I just think what must koh phi phi be like now ? With no visitors ?
>>I just think what must koh phi phi be like now ? With no visitors ?===========================There are still Thai domestic tourists travelling

"UK FCO website:""The Foreign & Commonwealth Office currently advises British nationals against all but essential international travel.""Thailand isn't on the exempted countries list.So pretty clear and unambiguous from the UK side!That's as far as you need to go to know you can't travel, but even when Thailand does get a 'green light' from the UK FCO, there will then be the issue of Thai government policy, and I can't see them welcoming folks from the UK any time soon."

"""Planning a spontaneous open ended travel marathon."" I would suggest next year as a more realistic time frame. Chances are probably slim to none that travellers from the UK will be allowed into Thailand this year."
The plan is November. But I wouldn't book just yet if I were you.
Cheers for updates. I'll Wait for my usual dec - may slot then. Weather better too. Hell I miss thailand.
"It's not ""ear on the ground"" stuff, its government web sites you should be looking at.At present the is no admission for any foreign tourists.When Thailand begins to open, it is unlikely that UK will be amongst the first allowed in based on current Covid performance.It is likely that all visitors to Thailand will require Covid health certificates, I durance and face travel/movement restrictions too.Check with the TAT website.https://www.tourismthailand.org/Edited: 3:31 am, July 24, 2020 "
"If u like it this much to post u should have any u want. Its silly cheap so need for unlimited. I just had my silly farrang som tum kai khem. Wife had prarah (sp) I like that rarely. So much more options. Mango, long bean cucumber. It's all fun just pay more. I would go as far as finding a good maker, that helps too much."
"No foreign tourists allowed indefinitely, unless you're privileged enough to be some military personnel. It seems the junta has secret agreements to allow international tourism among military personnel. Recently an Egyptian soldier on 'military duties' was diagnosed with the virus and yesterday 6 Thai soldiers on 'military exercise' in Hawaii was diagnosed with the virus upon returning to Thailand."
There goes the imported cases of covid 19.Better to keep out foreign tourist than to start 2nd wave infection like in Australia. Chok Dee
"#5: Actually, Thailand IS on the FCO list of exempted countries https://tinyurl.com/yd8m54ok . There is then a second FCO list of those countries for which there is a requirement to self-isolate upon return to the UK https://tinyurl.com/y47oc3q4 . Perversely, Thailand does appear on that list (I've no idea why, since the chances of catching Covid-19 remain considerably higher in the UK than in Thailand)!But as you say, this is all academic because Thailand isn't currently allowing any visitors in at the moment, least of all those from a country with the 3rd highest death rate in the world.So perhaps not so clear and unambiguous (i.e. about par for the course as far as the UK government is concerned).Edited: 12:19 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"""Are visitors allowed from uk now ? (Think we have only to self isolate on return to uk for 14 days)""N0 tourists are allowed to visit Thailand at this time. How is lockdown affecting say koh san road ?Businesses and hawkers are clearly suffering with the lack of foreign tourists, but locals continue to shop. However, Ko San Road relies heavily on tourist business.All the sites open?YES, I believe most sites remain open, but with social distancing in place and face masks compulsory.Stay safe !"
Thailand is closed to Foreigners at the moment. I know this as I am in Thailand now been her since mid January apart from a week in February in Singapore. At the moment Tourist are aloud to stay visa free until mid September when they will have to leave or sort out a visa extension. Well if I where you I would wait until next year to come to Thailand. At the moment all Asian countries have there borders closed due to the covid 19:
"#17, ""Well if I where you I would wait until next year to come to Thailand.""That sounds like very wise advice, or wait until a Covid 19 vaccine is widely available and Thailand re-open their borders to foreign travellers again.Stay safe !"
"Domestic travels are open. Inbound flights are still unpredictable. Hoping that things will get better in the coming months. Hotels, ferry tickets via PhuketFerry are all set. They are open for a reschedule which is nice but really hoping that borders will be open soon. I miss Thailand too!"
""" Inbound flights are still unpredictable ""Not really, tourists are not allowed in as it has been for a few months now"
"With the second wave of Covid-19 beginning to spread in Europe, a trip to Thailand this year would be next to impossible if you are a regular tourist coming from the EU. I'm in the process of cancelling my flight (Cathay Pacific, cancellation fees waived). The only sticking point is getting a voucher or a refund for nonrefundable bookings before I proceed with cancelling the flight scheduled for mid October. Next time, I will make sure to only book refundable hotel rooms and preferably directly with the hotel. Oh, I was told by Agoda that they could do nothing for me and I needed to get the hotel's approval to waive cancellation fees. Something to remember next time I book a hotel room!Edited: 12:15 pm, August 06, 2020 "

"This should answer the OP, and the rest who can't seem to research & read. Actually a decent read:https:/…a-zero-sum-approach-to-covid-19-could"" The bad news is that many scientists think it’s doubtful that the vaccines now being developed will end the pandemic once and for all. In a recent story in The Atlantic which quotes a bunch of experts, Sarah Zhang wrote:“An initial vaccine might limit Covid-19’s severity without entirely stopping its spread. Think flu shot, rather than polio vaccine.”Meanwhile, “travel corridor” arrangements between Thailand and other countries that have suppressed the virus have been put on ice, and a leading Thai medical professor suggested delaying them for at least six months. ...........Given the panicked response to the Covid-19 incidents in Rayong and Bangkok, it’s safe to say that many Thais would prefer to keep foreign tourists out until they pose no risk at all......When taking a zero-sum approach, anything more than zero is hard to accept.""__________________________________________________________Read this over & over again, till it sinks in.
