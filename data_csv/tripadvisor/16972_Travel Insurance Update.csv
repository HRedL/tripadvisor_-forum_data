I just checked my insurance policy on line and appears that I am not covered for Coronavirus ( regardless of purchase date ) I am with 1 Cover.Please check your policy as it may be an expensive experience if you contract the virus.
"Southern Cross Travel Insurance not covering on policies bought after Friday 31st January, 12pm."
"A lot of insurances won’t cover an Epidemic or Pandemic. I just checked TID, who I have for my next Bali trip in March. It basically says that they won’t cover epidemic or pandemic if you do not follow advice of a governments warning. It won’t cover travel to China after 23 Jan 2020."
"Thanks LynnPP for your update, may I say "" Good choice "" in travel insurance.Hi Aussiesharon , it appears we are in a similar predicament; personally I would have considered travelling if I had insurance cover , without it I dont think I will.How about yourself, will you "" run the gauntlet "" and go without cover?"
"I actually read it that I do have cover. It is saying that they won’t cover for travel to/from China in respect to Coronavirus. And it won’t cover if I go against a government warning, which I obviously wouldn’t do. Either way, if I was going tomorrow, I’d still go. Can’t say what the situation will be in the next few weeks, but will keep a good eye on it.Edited: 6:14 am, February 13, 2020 "
"My apologies Aussiesharon12 , Am glad you hear you have cover.I am departing in May , so I too will wait and see"
"Actually, all travel insurance companies are saying they will not cover travel to any destination if your policy was purchased after 31 Jnuary 2020 for Coronoavirus."
"Calla2005: Yes , I noticed that ..Interesting times ahead"
"Just read the update for TID. It does say they won’t cover anywhere for Coronavirus if purchased after 6am 31 Jan. I purchased mine before this, and also advised my travel companions (who hadn’t yet purchased insurance) and they also purchased before this date. Lucky for us, but I’m still not too concerned about going to Bali. Although as I said before, that may change before I leave."
"Well done Aussiesharon12 , its good to be covered."
"Travel Insurance , just like car salesman . Its all good until you want to make a claim .Your money is good up until then."
"It leaves you in a very vulnerable situation finacially.I read that a certain test was in the thousands of dollars ( $ 35,000 ).."

"Hi Pompom , it appears that 40% of insurers are doing the same.Will you consider travel knowing that you are not covered ?"
