According to Not Me I now gather it is a World wide epidemic. I am returing to the uk on monday can somebody tell me what it is like on the ground. What havoc have the Government caused in the last 6 weeks. And today is Brexit day. Will tomorrow be riots in the streets will be quarantined?Even my normally sane son is sending me meassages about not bringing the virus back. I am really scared. Not.Had a great day at Bungsamran yesterday. 2 50kg giant mekongs. Can I get the virus from the fish slime?
why is thailand letting flights from china to land ?
What the hell has that got to do with what I asked. Not that what I said was serious. Can you start your own rubbish thread and not hijack my rubbish thread.
"You have to ask ... 555Health minister wants to stop VOATourist minister is against that idea.....go figure.""Tourism and Sports Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn says the government should not scrap visas-on-arrival (VOAs) for Chinese travellers despite the public health minister insisting on a suspension.Anutin Charnvirakul, the public health minister and Bhumjaithai Party leader, has said the state should scrap VOAs for Chinese travellers because the Chinese government has already banned outbound tours.""Paraphrased from:https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1847324…"

You may have to cancel your travel plans and stay put in paradise;-)Contact your travel insurance immediately- surely they should pay for the extension as it’s a world wide epidemic:-D

"Absolutely nothing wrong with a bit of light relief as long as you are not directly involved in any shape or form enjoy it while you canUnfortunately many inside and outside China are involved The financial losses will be felt for some time to come, China is a powerhouse including when it comes to their citizens travelling and spending money This cant be good especially for Thailand who have been welcoming the lions share in SE AsiaDont let this pour cold water on your entertaining Posts Unless you have vested interests of course or are a local who relies on them this probably might please some, as in Less Chinese aroundHappy TravelsEdited: 7:08 am, February 01, 2020 "
"WHO says it's World Wide....not me23 out of 195 countries, is far from worldwide. Less than 12k case among 7.7 trillion people, is far from 'health emergency'With all of 259 dead, 11,791 cases (est ...20 hrs ago)..it's all a bit of a joke, don't you think.More people died on the roads here this week."
"OMB ... 12+ k cases now.China have all 259 dead, and 11,791 cases.World wide.....health emergency... really.... people need to put new batteries in their calculators and update their dictionaries.Edited: 8:35 am, February 01, 2020 "
"Reality check ... how does that compare to the 'everyday flu'Well lets see: ""Every year an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die in the world due to complications from seasonal influenza (flu) viruses. This figure corresponds to 795 to 1,781 deaths per day due to the seasonal flu.""795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day795 to 1,781 deaths per day..........NOW ... let that sink in, take as long as you need.While y'all are at it.......look up idiot in the dictionary.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"@POST 15Idiot you say, yes I agree anyone who ignores a new virus which has no vaccination as yet and has taken 259 souls up to press could be described as suchIts quite understandable why people should be concerned, although the number of threads has been overdone just a bitHa Ha HaYou must have seen the sign ""Park here at your own Risk""Ha Ha HaNo doubt more people will die on Thailands roads every week but thats their choice, so be itThe only cure for that is obvious, ""UP TO THEM"" my manHappy TravelsEdited: 12:10 pm, February 01, 2020 "
"Yes, working the numbers now, I can understand why everyone is so concerned, and we have so many queries about CoronaVirus.Better stay home, as Thailand is in the top 2% of the world's countries (195) of having the most infected people with CoronaVirus.So more likely to catch it here, after China & Japan,, than the other 98 % of remaining world's 192 countries...........go elsewhere.555Edited: 9:54 pm, February 01, 2020 "
