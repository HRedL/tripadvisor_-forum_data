"I just wanted to say ""thank you so much"" to you, Nicksy, for all of your hard work in posting & up-dating your COVID-19 post! It was extremely informative. I appreciate that this is a travel forum, but the information you gave was very useful also to those of who are not Greek, but live here in Greece all the time & have been here throughout. Thanks! Jackie"

"Nicksy, you too!"
Let me add my thanks to Nicksy for creating the Covid-19 thread.
"Hi yes I too although I made no comments, that was my first port of call watching what was happening daily (during this cruel time for everyone)!So once again thank you very much to Nicksy, Yiassas and Absolute Athens."
"Hear, Hear.Nicksy, Yiassas, Absolute Athens et al, well done for keeping everyone informed & (somehow, god knows how!) keeping it factual, non-argumentative & calm. An excellent thread."
I'll be in Nea Moudania for 6 weeks from September 4th (if all goes well!!!). Why don't you all come over to buy me a drink LOL
Double ouzo ok?! Yammas!
