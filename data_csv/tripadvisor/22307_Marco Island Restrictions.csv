"Can somebody tell me what the exact restrictions are for Marco. Supposed to come at the end of September and when talking to realtor she said ""we are doing fine here.....everything is open with no restrictions"". I realize it is her job but it is also a lie. I read that ""everything"" is not open with no restrictions.Better yet....can someone point to a reliable source that is kept up to date on the virus and restrictions specifically for Marco? I am waiting a month or so before I decide. Thanks in advance"

"In the state of Florida, the governor left it up to individual counties to make their own Covid rules. Some counties allow bars to sell ""to go"" alcohol to customers, others do not. Marco Island is in Collier county. It appears as if some requirements will expire the beginning of September unless extended. I suggest you follow: https://www.colliercountyfl.gov/ and the local TV station: https://www.winknews.com/Also, keep tabs on the covid 19 site that Marco Red listed."
Thanks to all
