"I've found this page provided by Korean Air, which has been updated almost daily, very handy to track some of the many changes happening right now. https:/…2020_02_TSA_detail.htmlIf anyone knows of any other airlines that have compiled a list for other regions of the world, please let us know. A lot of us have upcoming plans in many parts of world."
Thank you.

This is an other useful link of Lufthansa : https:/…flight-information
"So I am still puzzled regarding the Japan announcement about South Korea quarantine procedures.--------------------------------------Japan• Anyone including nationals of Japan who has traveled from/transited in South Korea or China will be quarantined at a designated place for 14 days upon arrival. (Mar 9 - Mar 31)• Anyone who has visited Daegu/Cheongdo/Kyeongbuk(7 city/county) in Korea in the past 14 days is not permitted to enter Japan. (as of Mar 7)--------------------------------------So it happens I will be traveling from Korea to Malaysia on April 19, and then flying from Malaysia to Japan on April 25.I won't be visiting any of the restricted areas in Korea so the entry ban won't apply to me however I will have travel history to Korea in the last 14 days. Technically I won't be flying from or transiting through South Korea when flying to Japan. So what in those cases? Will they impose quarantine? Has anyone had a similar experience?Same thing happened in Thailand where they mentioned they would quarantine anyone from South Korea, Japan, etc but it wasn't that way. You could be subject to quarantine even if you don't show symptoms but you won't be necessarily quarantined.Edited: 7:03 am, March 06, 2020 "
"From how I interpreted- how THEY will interpret it, you will have transited Korea on the way to Japan. Never mind if you stop over a few days elsewhere. You passed Korea in the last 14 day Where they are concerned, if 14 days have NOT passed since you transited Korea you will be subject to quarantine. How long-maybe the remaining days (to reach 14) or a new 14."
I would read it as if you haven't visited any of the places mentioned in Korea you should be OK ….BUT …..it would be at the discretion of the country you are visiting I guess so good luck
"As of my understanding on their rules:• Anyone including nationals of Japan who has traveled from/transited in South Korea or China will be quarantined at a designated place for 14 days upon arrival.- Since you will be arriving Japan a week after you had transitted Korea, then you will be quarantined."
"Apparently Qatar no longer allows Koreans, Thais, Italians, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Indian citizen to enter Qatar. QR stopped all flights to Italy."
"^^^^^Not really some political exclusions on their full list, or maybe they've just lost the plot."
"The airlines are getting more concerned, or pressured from numerous governments, and now announcing the same quarantine restrictions are being enforced on nationals as well as visitors.Sadly, most people don't take self quarantine seriously. So the threat of further local outbreaks is now a huge concern."
Does anyone know about on onward travel via countries that are no longer issuing visas? I am travelling to Nepal on 19 March via Delhi (1.5 hour stopover in Delhi to change aeroplanes). India has stopped issuing entry visas now but Nepal hasn't. I don't require a visa for India as I am only changing planes there but will I be permitted to make my connection to onward travel?
"Regrettably, useless for Central Asia, although most if not all of the Stans have restrictions in place"
"Further to this subject, even the IATA site appears to be a bit slow with updates on individual countries' entry restrictions. The best I've been able to find so far is this one: https:/…countryLast update was 15 March, 1000UTCEdited: 4:42 am, March 16, 2020 "

Does anyone know if someone flying to US from Ukraine with a 1 hour stop in Germany will have any issues getting into the US?
Ukraine passportB1 visaVisiting boyfriendI know Ukraine is allowed to visit. Its the one hour layover in Germany that has me worred.
"AFAIK, if you connect in a banned country (e.g. Germany) you will be barred from entering the US."
"Yes I believe the USA government considers transit to be spending time in the country, even if you don't officially 'enter' it."
How about if she connected through Turkey?
Some may find this article helpful on what countries are opening up and the entry restrictions. There are embedded links which give more specifics about various countries. Some are requiring proof a negative covid test from within 72 hours prior to entry.https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-internation…
