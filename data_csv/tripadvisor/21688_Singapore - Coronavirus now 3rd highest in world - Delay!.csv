"I would STRONGLY suggest any visitors to Singapore to delay, if you can. I’m working in Singapore. I told my friends and family from UK and US NOT to visit and they all cancelled their plans. I’m basically living in self quarantine1. Entire office were all told to go work from home for next 2 weeks as of yesterday. Fairly big size Co. No business travel as of last week.2. From having only 1 case (Jan 23?) Singapore is now the 3rd highest number of cases in the world at 28 and rising..3. Singapore is the smallest land mass to be affected, very densely populated, hence virus spread human to human high risk.4. China has now quarantined 41 Million people. This is unprecedented in human history. It sounds like Sci-fi but for them it’s nothing but.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wu…5. Unverified reports emerging that China figures are underestimated Eg Financial Timeshttps:/…fa83463a-4737-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441BOTTOM LINE. Singapore is an amazing place! It will still be amazing and safer after the scare has passed. You need to wait it out but it’s your choice. This is just a warning and not an official one. None of my loved ones coming, be sure to protect you and yours.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"It's not automatic death sentence if you get infected. Patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital. Singapore's healthcare facilities and professionals are competent and capable. The current Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level is at Yellow. Should it be escalated at Orange level, travellers may want to reconsider their travel plans. Refer to the Health Ministry's page for the latest updates.MOH wuhan virus page: https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanWhat do different DORSCON levels mean: https://www.gov.sg/article/what-do-the-diffe…"
"So Singapore has 28 cases in a population of 5.6 million. In statistical terms, this is totally insignificant. There is quite amazing hysteria being spread by the media about this virus. There is far more danger of infection from ordinary flu."
"Agreed, not a death sentence, but given the rapid growth rate in cases being reported, I decided to delay my loved ones travelling here. Waiting it out seems sensible"
"3rd highest sounds bad but is it really? Just a few days ago, Singapore was in 4th place. You do realise there is a huge gap in the numbers between the 1st and 2nd place? If you’ve ever studied statistics, you will realise ranking is not a suitable way of comparison in this case.The recent increase in the number of cases is not unexpected given it has been less than 2 weeks since the border to those from China was closed. Singapore is also known to have an efficient healthcare system so the detection and reporting may be faster than countries with less well-equipped systems.Your intentions may be good but your approach borders on sensationalism."
"Minxbaby, apologies didn’t mean to add to the hysteria. Just made sense to ask loved ones to delay their visit to the amazing and safe Singapore we love to live in."
"Feb 7: China cases now growing at 10% a day, cases now 31,481Singapore is not China. Not at epicentre. No evidence of community spread.

Singapore 30 confirmed cases nowAnother flight from Wuhan planned to repatriate Singaporeans from epicentre https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…Measures placed in schools often later become measures placed in society. Social distancing measures implemented at schools in Singapore (new for Feb 6) - precautionary. “The announcement on 4 February by MOH of a few cases with no travel history to China marked a new phase of local transmission.Hence, MOE decided to stop mass events in schools like assemblies and camps. Given that there is no evidence of community spread as yet, there is no need to stop mass events but we are taking precautions for vulnerable groups, such as pre-schools and school children.”https:/…faqs-wuhan-coronavirus-infectionMy sister and family including 2 small kids officially cancelled today per advice. They wanted to wait until last moment to monitor."

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavi…
The key question is.... How many people are infected without demonstrating symptoms and unwittingly carriers of this seemingly highly contageous viral disease and also how long do they remain carriers?
"That’s the killer question. I guess it would depend on the incubation period. https:/…“...The incident was a chilling reminder of the “super-spreaders” in outbreaks of other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS — patients who infected huge numbers of other people, sometimes dozens. The phenomenon is poorly understood and unpredictable, an epidemiologist’s nightmare. Super-spreaders led to considerable transmission of MERS and SARS inside hospitals.“"
OP! Why are you scaremongering so much????? Outside of China this virus only has a 0.17% death rate which is lower than common flu viruses and yet you wouldn’t be shouting about that?!? It is ridiculous - calm down!! We have 33 cases in a population is 5.5 million. No one has died. We have the best healthcare service in the world. You are the reason people go out panic buying because you cause hysteria when there is NO NEED.
"Foreign companies are now choosing to avoid Singapore until threat level subsides. Also organisers of events In Singapore are looking at ways to reduce numbers of public visitors. Can take this as social distancing measure to avoid spread. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…“ The airshow will continue next week, but organisers might look to limit public visitors, Singapore said on Friday, as the country reported three more coronavirus cases that authorities have not yet linked to previous infections or travel to China”"
"@Rastnim, it’s my first experience of anything like this. I wasn’t around when SARS occurred here. I’m alarmed at what I’ve seen and experienced. My advice is To exercise caution If you are here and to delay if you are not. We would not be on Orange alert if this was a storm in a tea cup. You may choose to disagree.Edited: 6:42 am, March 23, 2020 "
Alarmist posts like yours are not helpful. It is totally safe to visit Singapore which has learnt a lot since SARS and has a huge number of precautions in place.
"Dear Rastnim, let’s agree to disagree. I stand by my advice to delay for newcomers to Singapore at least until official level reduces from Orange."

"I think the the point is that whilst it is very likely nothing would happen to most visitors and Singapore is extremely safe, the current situation can be detrimental to a good holiday. It's not fun when attractions are closed down and hawker centers are advised against. It is also not fun to be quarantined should anyone around us get ill or if developing temperature for a different reason. And finally I dread the fight I would have to take up with my insurance company or airliner should we need to leave/go to hospital/get quarantined.

"Story of one guy, gets infected in Singapore, shows no obvious symptoms, flies off to France and Spain, causes more than 100 to have to get tested. This is not the fault of Singapore authorities.

"DIGGING DEEPER INTO DORSCON“ The Ministry of Health (MOH) had stepped up our risk assessment from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange on 7 February, as there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to ChinaThe Singapore Government sets the DORSCON rating. A real objective acid test for all industries and individuals in Singapore. When they decided to increase the level to Orange from Yellow, they didn’t do so lightly. The Government knew full well this might increase hysteria but it decided to do so anyway because they are totally committed to quarantining it, by putting in some world class controls.When DORSCON goes Green, all of this hysteria and stress, will just go away. I pray that it will. My advice on delay is that I want my friends and family to visit here, with their kids, when stress is lower, when DORSCON is lower.‘Disease Outbreak Response System Condition’ (DORSCON) is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation. The framework provides us with general guidelines on what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections.DORSCON takes into account:“The current disease situation overseasHow transmissible the disease isHow likely it is to arrive in SingaporeWhat impact it may have on Singapore’s community”https://www.gov.sg/article/what-do-the-diffe…If you imagine threat level split into 4:green (0-25%)yellow (26- 50%)Orange (51-75%)Red ( 76 - 100%)It’s currently Orange (51-75%)“What are the additional measures to be introduced?Under DORSCON Orange, additional precautionary measures will be introduced to minimise the risk of further transmission of the virus, and raise the protection of vulnerable groups.Cancel or defer large-scale events, or put in place necessary precautions if proceeding“https://www.gov.sg/article/additional-measur…I stress that the response from the Government that I’ve personally been affected by, is world class. It does not mean I can pretend to ignore DORSCON, even in safe hands. I increase my vigilance as does everyone.

I hope this gets dealt with and fast. I was planning a visiting July but now reconsidering it.

Kudos to the world class health system in Singapore for doing all it can. I pray for the 8 still critically ill, and hope they join the super 15 very soon!

">>I think the figures speak for themselves if cases grow at say 4 a day, I’m expecting around 100 cases by Feb 24. That’s 100 cases in a single month estimated at current trend<<...and the dengue figures continue to be between 300-400 per week.Dengue fever is just as bad, if not worse than Covid-19.There are far more dengue clusters in Singapore than known Covid clusters....Don't see many people avoiding Singapore because of dengue?So please put things in perspective when deciding whether to come or not."
"The main difference between dengue and corona virus is that dengue transmitters (mosquitoes) can be generally visually seen, whereas corona virus carriers cannot be seen. It is relatively easier to protect yourselves from mosquitoes. Most of the hotels keep free from mosquitoes and so are the major tourist attractions. The places where tourists might catch dengue are fewer in number than those where residents may catch. Dengue is a bigger risk for residents than tourists."
"To allI think it is important to emphasise - everything i write here is just an opinion. I could easily, and hopefully be proven wrong, and I am open to it. Where there are facts, these are supported by links to articles which i hope will aid in your decision.There are plenty of tourists still coming to amazing Singapore, and happy to come, you can choose to take this with a pinch of salt, and just up your hygiene at the very minimum. Whatever you decide, is always your choice, and everyone has an opinion, I'm just a little more cautious than most.Take careBill"
"Repeat after me... 58 people out of 6 million-ish... Yes, s**t happens and you might catch it, but it's not at every corner you turn, and I don't know statistics but it seems quite a low probability (and I was also told this by experts - people who work with these things). The panic-spreading is way more stressful than the health threat in my opinion."
"We are booked to go beginning of April. I'm not scared of getting the virus, but I am not really keen on walking around in a mask and attractions and food outlets being closed. My hotel says that it's constantly checking people. Doesn't seem that I'll have a care free holiday."
"Just wanted to clarify that attractions and food outlets are NOT closed. Not sure where you heard that from, but it's not true. No need to wear a mask unless your sick - I certainly don't.Edited: 1:37 am, February 14, 2020 "
>>but I am not really keen on walking around in a mask and attractions and food outlets being closed. My hotel says that it's constantly checking people.<<You don't need to walk around in a mask unless you are ill. Attractions and food outlets are all open as they still have the 6 million people who reside here to look after. They're not here to just look after tourists!Hotel constantly checking people is a good thing that is part of DORSCON orange. Most venues you'll visit will take your temperature whether it be passing through a heat scanner or being individually tested. This is a good thing and reassuring IMO as it will quickly highlight anybody who may be a concern and needs to be looked at.From my perspective there is minimal change and there's a huge plus side as everywhere is quiet.
I'm going to decide at the end of the month. I just love Singapore so much I don't want to miss out on anything!

deaddredd - i think you lucked out! Well done. I've never ever ever been able to get a refund on a non-refundable. I think it must be your charm ;) Some are finding it harder to get a refund if they bought from an agent...

Tried with Qantas and they said straight out no.
"Lufthansa are not refunding either, however hard you beg :0("
"Deadred, I think because it is SA they are more sympathetic, they are the national carrier and want to maintain customers. If you give your TA the information they need to put your case for a refund they should succeed just as an individual succeeds. You need to push the TA to do the work for you but if they were not cooperative I'd be getting some confirmation from SA that a refund is possible and then taking it back to the TA."
"food for thought about why the numbers in singapore are high. compare this to other countries which do not extensively test for the virus or do thorough contact tracing. ""Health care experts say the Singapore government’s approach of actively weeding out those affected could explain its relatively high number of cases, while Hong Kong’s relatively low number might mean there could be silent carriers within the community.Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease expert at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, suggested Singapore was detecting more cases because it gave an incentive for citizens to come forward when they were unwell, and citizens in general trusted the government.""https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-enviro…"
"from the same article ""Singapore’s neighbouring countries were likely to have a lot more cases but they were not “looking hard enough”.There have been fears that Indonesia, which has close links with China, was under-reporting cases, with officials saying that Indonesian nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, would not need to be tested for the virus.Jeremy Lim, a partner at global consultancy firm Oliver Wyman’s health and life sciences practice, said more developed nations tended to have better detection – and reporting – of cases, more “sophisticated” contact tracing, and a wider availability of test kits.“Better hospitals tend to have higher rates, at least initially, of medication errors and other avoidable events,” he said.“It is not just because the culture of transparency is stronger and motivation for learning higher, but the resources that can be invested in tracking events.”https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-enviro…"
"Yes, you’re so right. Transparency in Singapore is a lot higher. We know the most accurate assessment almost real time. The budget for this type of contingency is alot higher. Less transparent countries will not declare to WHO as readily or they might not be as prepared. I am full of praise for the medical teams. It is under control ORANGE. I hope it will come down soon and all of this will just go away.I stress again, everyone has an opinion, and whatever you decide, based on your research, is the right choice."
"Cases have risen to 67, a bit higher than I thought, but still within control on Dorscon Orange. It is unlikely to go Red because that will bring Singapore to a standstill - total lockdown.

"Seriously Bill?? I've seen you causing unnecessary panic in various threads. I'm cautious, but not overly paranoid.I visited Jewel (the airport) yesterday, it was so crowded. There were both locals & visitors, nobody seemed bothered. Everyone was cautious (a sneeze will draw immediate stares), but definitely not paranoid or overly worried. I wish I can show you the photos of the crowd here. The Singapore government is doing a really good job in managing the situation. People who are unfortunately infected are quarantined almost immediately, and those in close contact with them are also immediately put on Leave Of Absence (self-quarantine) to monitor themselves (under supervision from the Ministry of Health). No attractions are closed. Everything is open, everything seems fine. If I'm a visitor, I will not cancel my trip, but I will exercise caution and personal hygiene when I'm here."
Please take a window seat......how realistic is that Bill when travelling with family members. Why create more fear amongst travellers by making these sort of suggestions?
Regarding choosing a window seat on a plane rather than choosing an isle seat. If I take a window seat I'm more at risk of DVT because I can't move around easily. If I take an isle seat I'm more at risk of catching a virus. Looks like I'm stuffed no matter what I do!
"Hi Michelle,I'm sorry, I would suggest - where practical to do so, and where you have a choice, at least try to, if you must travel.

"Hi dracwy.Singapore medical system response has been amazing so far, must say. Acknowledged belowhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…https:/…Hi HeatSeeker,Yes, you're right, the final decision rests with government. Red means ""disease is severe and spreading widely"". Seems logical, in that very unlikely scenario, to lock down like in China to limit spreading to other countries."
"It looks like Singapore Airlines is being squeezed hard by Covid 19 impact. Suggest if anyone wants a refund but hasn’t taken it, consider it soon. If they’re squeezed too tightly refund “willingness” might change. https://www.air101.co.uk/2020/02/singapore-airlines-faces-significant.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+co/fMxO+(Air101)&m=1As of today, there are now 72 infected. If it keeps growing as it has we might well see 100 cases within 2 weeks. Eg approximate 3.42 weeks since the first case Jan 23, infections are growing at around 21 new cases every week ( someone correct my math, I know it’s not linear so I’m probably incorrect or understated). This means, if no declines and we may see declines (I hope!!) we can expect to see around 100 cases within 2 more weeks. Hitting that 100 case threshold soon must be put into context1. Our medical system is world class and one of the most transparent in the world. 2. DORSCON Orange threat level will most likely stay the same. This means no need to panic and situation is under control. 3. 100 is just a number, it’s not 10,000 or 1M. The gasps will be more psychological than of any real significance. Hence panic buying might increase again. Bottom line - no panic needed."
@ BillUK32 in a small nation like Singapore you know why there is quite alot infected out here ? Thats more than Hong Kong and HK only has 1 (atleast last I checked) thats recovered. Only thing I can think that it's an international flight hub that handles many passengers and yep I know there is also a very big population here too..not panicking just curious ;)
"Hi Mark t, Suggest you read the link below. Have to say though, Singapore medical response has been truly amazing. We have 18 recoveries. I stress 18 because it’s the second largest number of recoveries next to China. Factors to consider explaining variance 1. Trust in and Transparency of Singapore Govt and Medical system far higher in Singapore. 2. Yes hub factor 3. Pre Chinese New Year, Post CNY, chalk and cheese. Many Singaporeans returned from infected places in China now in quarantine. They just weren’t tested early enough.4. Singapore protocols for dealing with Covid 19 were set post SARS 20 years ago, practised ever since. Multiple other factors - see article Takeaway - no panic. Under control.https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/…Edited: 3:57 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"@Bill32UK yeah forgot that many mainland chinese people chose Singapore and poss. some other asian cities for the CNY and holiday etc.. rather than HK due to protests etc...and yes 18 recoveries quite impressive so far hopefully there be more, one thing (amongst many) I like about Singapore is how clean the city is and how good the medical system is out there not that I had to use it in the past. Well I keep checking the situation bit further as I'm supposing to be going back to Hong Kong (which I'm also checkign situation on) too but want to do Singapore first for few days."
"So Bill, if it were you and your family and friends you'd like to see no one travelling outside their own countries unless absolutely necessary? When there is an outbreak of seasonal flu that is particularly bad would you also choose not to travel? I've often come home from international travel with a cold so clearly it is a source of infection and transfer. Perhaps if all travellers took a holiday in their own country until this is under control, or everyone just give up international travel full stop and lets go back to pre globalisation. It's scary how much the world depends on tourism and yet for some places tourism is destroying their lives and homes (Venice for example). It's all too hard and my brain hurts....."
"Hi Michelle, If you must travel and if you have a cold or cough, it’s only being thoughtful of others that you wear a mask.“After 9/11 lots of people gave up flying and there were more traffic accidents” from HeatSeeker I think this says a lot - there is no need to panic. Numbers are increasing but under Dorscon Orange Control. As for my family and friends, if they had flu or a temperature, again I’d ask them to delay. I also stand by my advice to them to delay for this virus outbreak as they have kids, and it would be hard to see what they touched or put in their mouths. However no advice is right for everyone and you can review and decide for yourself ."

"Wouldn't the fact that the number of infected only rose by 3 be 'good news' Bill? ... and that they were all essentially linked to the same cluster, once again; in other words, people were not contracting the virus simply by being out and about.Wouldn't this be *good* ?And Bill, about your statement ...""People spending hours in queues for hand sanitiser which along with masks, remains sold out in most places.""You run the risk of discrediting anything you say by trotting out unfounded nonsense ... don't you think? You really think that someone has waited hours in line for hand sanitiser ... ? (waiting among people, who, to listen to you, probably are all contagious.) Places ""are deserted"" and yet there are hundreds in line ... waiting for hours. Is this correct Bill?There are lots of masks available in Dubai. Stores can't get rid of them. They have signs up, saying that they are available. Not yet do the signs say ""please, please, won't somebody please purchase a mask"" but it is likely coming.I'll bring a few cartons of them to Singapore. Probably I can get them cheap. I'll leave them on (the deserted) street corners of Singapore.C'mon Bill ..."
"Bill thank you for keeping up with this thread - it's obvious that for various reasons people do worry about going on holiday to SE Asian countries due to the virus and its effect on having a good vacation.When you say places are deserted - I assume you mean the number of tourists are down just now. But are locals still out and about on the streets, is there some life in the city? I am really looking forward to the street food, that was one of the reasons I wanted to visit Singapore. I hope the hawker centres are still open as usual."
"Places are not deserted. The destination experts have abandoned these threads because, apparently, Bill is a little over enthusiastic (shall we say.)When, on the one hand people are ""queuing for hours"" (for ""hand sanitiser"" (seriously?)), and then on the other hand Singapore is deserted, there would seem to be a conflict of information.The moderators on this forum are asleep at the switch. They are deleting the wrong posts.This is supposed to be a trip advice forum. There is precious little that is of an advisory nature here.There were 3 additional cases yesterday, which represents a decline. Moreover, they were all from the same cluster (once again.)The percentages stated in post #71 are simply absurd. Well meaning people are cancelling trips based on serious misrepresentations.This entire thread should be locked (or deleted.)Moderators ... ???"
"#71 @billukNot meant as a criticism, but I think it’s a little contradicting asking people not to panic and yet quoting the Tuas article, along with the following statements:“People spending hours in queues for hand sanitiser....”“...some places largely deserted...”For sure the Tuas incident did happen and some are getting a little nervous, but I certainly don’t think the above is an accurate interpretation of what is happening in the whole of Singapore. Should I not be staying here, I may ran a wrong impression of the actual situation here by reading what was written in your post. Just my opinion. @hakapeci Hawker centres are still open, locals are still out in the streets. True there are lesser crowds at tourists attractions and other places, but I definitely wouldn’t say deserted."
"PositiveNegative,Fair point actually. Let me qualify it, I was in CBD. I went to Lau Pa Sat which has amazing chicken Satay. It also has tables in the street on weekends and is a wonderful place for any newcomers to Singapore to try. I actually took pics to send my friends and family, it’s a shame I can’t attach pics here. In the pics you would have seen 25% of the tables taken. So it’s not deserted, if I would usually expect 1000 people in a place with seating Capacity for 2500, I saw a crowd of about 250 people. This means people are still coming out. You will still see crowds. But this is only true for where I was, not the whole of Singapore. I did say “some places” and CBD. Theres a whole lot more to Singapore than just CBD. Also let me further qualify that I do not in any way work for the travel industry. I have no vested interest to speak for the travel industry I speak only for myself. what I said was only my opinion and you are welcome to give your own experience too even if you disagree with mine. Ok by me. You’ve heard from others like HeatSeeker who is having a wonderful time in Singapore and taking advantage of smaller crowds to get served quicker, queue up less. I also confirm that. it was great to get served more quickly than usual. The run on hand sanitiser and face masks does extend to CBD where I was yesterday. Hope that qualifies"
"Dear Hakapeci,Everything in Singapore is still open.its business as usual. Lau Pa Sat - every stall at this famous hawker centre was open. If you are coming, and up your hygiene, come with confidence knowing, like others, you’ll find you actually don’t have to queue up much and it works to your advantage. Sorry, I couldn’t tell the difference between a local and tourist, but you can estimate the difference from expected crowds size if you’ve been there before.Let me also say, the situation is very fluid. It can change day by day. Whet will not change is that Singapore is an amazing place in the world to be.I hope that helps and encourages you !"
"#76 @BillukI have been to regional Malls and Hawker centres over the last few days. They were still quite crowded when I was there. If you are claiming say 20% lesser crowd, I would fully agree but they are certainly not ‘deserted’ by any means, which comes to my point that what you had experienced and written may not be a good representation of the actual situation experienced elsewhere, hence it may not be wise to make a sweeping judgement. Your post come across as overly negative of the situation here in Singapore. I do agree there is nervousness in some, but I certainly don’t think there is widespread desperation across the island as of yet, which is the impression I get from some of your statements made through the post. Just my opinion, and I don’t work for the travel industry either."
"#74Firstly, welcome to Singapore. I assume you are here now. I am not sure of what your agenda is but it doesn't matter. I would simply encourage you to ignore this thread and focus on hundreds of others of interest rather than those of disinterest.Please refer to #222 in response to your earlier posts.https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…and post #21, this thread.Thank youEdited: 6:18 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Hi PositiveNegative,Thank you for confirming other hawker centres are also open and crowds are not affected by more than 20%. Thats good to know. I plan to visit East Coast park and try the hawker centre there on the weekend after my bike ride. Will update here. My observation was limited to one hawker centre that i visited and the area CBD. There is no ""widespread desperation"" that i have observed. From what i can see, its resilience, a can do attitude that says ""lets play safe but lets play."" Its a privilege to be part of it.I reiterate, without ambiguity, everything is still open. Nothing is closed. Some can take advantage of smaller crowds. Thank you"
"@Billuk, I stay at Tenah Merah, recently visited Bedok Central and Tampines Central after working hours. You may want to pay these places a visit. Do let me know if by any chance these places are deserted as per your definition. Thank you.Edited: 6:59 pm, February 16, 2020 "

"Bill, the figure you quoted for Japan includes the cruise ship Diamond Princess, remove that and there are 52 cases in Japan, see https:/…wuhan-virusI always say people's risk assessment is highly erratic, often incorrect (that includes me), so the lack of people in CBD last night may just be one of those things.Yesterday we took bus 123 to Sentosa Beach Station. The bus was much less crowded than before the virus struck.The area around Beach Station was deserted, when we went for lunch, McDonald's outside seating was almost deserted (normally we'd have expected to have to find an empty table).Then we headed for the beach, and it was busier than we've seen it this trip, except over CNY when we didn't go. More people in the sea, and plenty sitting on the beach.We finished at Vivocity, and wanted a taxi. No delay, lots of taxis waiting for us, over the last few days we've repeatedly seen evidence that taxis are finding it difficult to get customers.Edited: 7:18 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Bad News: Cases rose to 75 yesterday, 5 criticalGood News: Today’s magic number is 19! (18 yesterday)19 recoveries from Covid 19 infection, and those critically ill decreased from 8 to 5!This number 19 must be put into context: With Singapore’s 19 recoveries from 75 infections, you get a whopping 1 full recovery for every 4 infected (approx). Testament to an amazing job being done by our Super medical teams!

Business as usual most placesBad news: In CBD last night, and around Lau Pa Sat crowds were down by up to 75%. This is not representative of the whole of Singapore where crowds have been observed by others (thank you for confirming PositiveNegative) This might actually be good news if you do go out and you don’t like queuing up.Either way, no need to panic. All is under control.Edited: 7:23 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"I think the key idea here is not to discuss whether some places are still crowded while others are in your definition deserted, but rather as per my original post #75, what was depicted by your original post of the situation in Singapore is an accurate reflection of the situation here. All said. Thank you."
">>Thank you for confirming other hawker centres are also open and crowds are not affected by more than 20%. Thats good to know. I plan to visit East Coast park and try the hawker centre there on the weekend after my bike ride. Will update here<<Bill your example of LPS is a poor one. The CDB and LPS are very quiet at the weekends. So while your 75% down in numbers is correct if comparing to a weekday, it is not if comparing Sunday/weekend numbers. 20% down is what I would say it's like.This is a similar occurrence at Maxwell too.Now the East Coast Park you will notice a huge drop-off in crowds. You just don't see the usual weekend gatherings, picnics and BBQs especially on the Sunday. This I believe is down to the amount of mis-information and higher level amount of paranoia among the helper/maid/labourers who frequent the ECP most on their day's off. This is evident around the bay area too, as their usual gathering haunts are empty.Just ask your helper/maid and they'll show you an astonishing amount of fake-news on their facebook/whatups groups and you can see what's driving their behavior.The war is just not against covid-19, but it's against the spread of mis-information which has spread far faster.This is why it is so important in a forum such as this to give real facts within the correct context so that people can make an informed decision about the situation.Unfortunately I do not believe that this is really happening here in these forums."
"I agree wholeheartedly with post #74. I am more stressed about the part of the population that panics, and my attempts to put it into perspective, than the threat itself. Of course I could just stop bothering.Personally, I am more likely to die of a heart attack every time I board a freezing bus or enter a freezing mall after having been out in the heat... the temperature shock is astounding.Oh, I got hand sanitizer, in a local shop in my local area, which looked as busy as usual in that moment. No queues for the stuff though. I also happened to go to a mall, not in my area but I happened to be there, and there was a kids' area with kids playing in it. Kids on non-paranoid parents, I guess!On the other hand, I have friends who don't travel into the city centre and only stay local, taking taxis if they need to move a step further, or colleagues worried about long commutes."
"You just can't govern stupidity...""Despite the authorities' advice for those who are unwell to stay at home, 34.9 per cent of respondents said they would attend an important event, such as a meeting, wedding or exam, even if they had developed symptoms like a sore throat or slight cough in the morning.""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…"
"Hi Little_Wong,Yes it’s true Sunday’s are quieter in CBD normally, and this is a contributing factor to what I saw and took pics of. Wasn’t meant as a generalisation and stated the same per update. Bill"
I had business trips upcoming to Singapore on February 19th and China on March 20th. It was a pretty easy decision to cancel both trips. I am connected to 200 people in China using WeChat and several in Singapore using WhatsApp. For Singapore I am also monitoring the Singapore Ministry of Health website and local Singapore media every day. This discussion thread is very helpful also. My Singapore business contacts believe that they may need to start working from home soon. I am trying to figure when to reschedule both business trips but my instincts tell me it will be several months if not longer.

"Good News! The magic number today is 24 recoveries!Although Singapore now has 77 infections, this increased by 2 ( a smaller increase than expected!) and 24 full recoveries.This means approximately 1 in every 3 infected recovers fully! Unfortunately, we still have 4 in intensive care and I hope they also all recover soon and there are zero casualties. A new study from Harvard gave Singapore a ""Gold Standard"" for Coronavirus detection.For a barometre of what life is like in Singapore right now, BlairKK in post#92 and HeatSeekerWrexham_UK post #86, tell it pretty much how it is as of today/yesterday. With thanks to all who have contributed. Even if we disagree, it is noted and well appreciated.In other news, found a map which shows location of every case in Singapore to date. Hand Santisers and Face masks continue to be overcharged in some places and the BBC has more on cruising and how risks are mitigated in an article. PM Lee says Coronavirus may pivot Singapore into a recession. See links below on more on these.""Covid-19 detection in S’pore is ‘of gold standard & near perfect’: Harvard study""https:/…https://www.techtimes.com/articles/247395/20…""..A 50ml bottle of Dettol hand sanitiser, while sold out at many pharmacies and supermarkets, could be found for between S$5 and S$7 at some shops in Chinatown and Little India, at least the double the regular retail price..."" https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…""Singapore PM says recession possible due to coronavirus outbreak - Straits Times""https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-health-…""COVID-19: Here’s every coronavirus infection in Singapore on a map""https:/…""The largest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China is not in a country, but on a cruise ship.""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51470603"
"That's excellent news, Bill.We also found this article which partly explains the dreadful increase in cases in Wuhan and Hubei. See https:/…world-asia-china-51449675 then find '18 January the Wuhan authorities' and read the next few paragraphs about 2 massive events held in Wuhan just before human to human transmission was proved.That won't happen in Singapore."
What about flight connections through Singapore? Flight from LAX connects through SIN to get to Thailand. Is the airport generally clean?
I would be much more worried about cleanliness in Thailand than Singapore
"Elijah, the airport has always been very clean and they are sanitising more frequently now as a precaution. https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…Edited: 10:36 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"Hi Elijah, you can rest assured all measures possible have been taken at Changi. It’s the heart and soul of Singapore as a hub. It’s a “Jewel” in the crown. It’s the centre of Government deployed hygiene measures.However, nothing can ever replace your own vigilance which ought to be heightened. ”Changi Airport steps up cleaning, hygiene measures in light of COVID-19 concerns”https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…“ It is unknown exactly how long the novel coronavirus can linger on contaminated surfaces and objects with the potential of infecting people”https:/…index.html"
"Yes, we don’t know how long the virus can survive on surfaces but with the increased frequency of cleaning and people observing personal hygiene (not touching the face before cleaning their hands), the risk can be minimised.Edited: 10:52 pm, February 17, 2020 "
Hi We will be reaching Singapore on sat morning(22 Feb) and leaving in the evening.We were thinking of visiting Merlion. What do you guys suggest we should take MRT or taxi given the virus situation in Singapore?Also how crowded Saturday’s are lately?Thanku
So minxbaby it would seem that there really is no need to be paranoid about transiting in Singapore.
"Hi Michelle,No need to be paranoid at all. Rest assured the cleaning teams at Changi are working overtime. Just be vigilant as well.Hi Gururaj,Taxi vs MRT, is one person vs many. Taxi with window open or MRT works. You should best decide for yourself what’s more convenient. Unsure about crowds on Sat, haven’t been in a while.Edited: 1:21 am, February 18, 2020 "

"Gururaj, I have been taking the MRT (only at weekends as I take the bus to work) and I'm still alive. It is a little quieter than usual, but not empty. Well, certain lines at certain stations seem to be empty no matter what, but the one I take never is. The last two Saturdays I've got a seat, but not from my departing station. Normally I'm 80% likely to stand all the way, or at least until it empties out in the most central stations.So while the decision on how to travel is yours, I can tell people still take the MRT even if it is a little less crowded.Oh, I saw a guy coughing on the MRT and the woman standing hear him moved far away. I don't mean two steps, I mean across a row of seats and near the opposite door, if I can describe it so ;)Edited: 7:34 am, February 18, 2020 "

"Hi mmmm19,I do agree with you, that the situation is under control. The Sky isnt falling. Singapore Medical teams are of gold standard (Harvard). I do agree with you that life goes on. I also know that the situation is very fluid and that it can turn one way and then another. I still stand by my advice. I see it as fit for a family with kids or others who have pre-existing respiratory problems like Asthma. When you have got kids and you cant control what they touch, what they put in their mouth, imo it is better to delay. I do not work in the travel industry. Safety is my primary concern. Its up to everyone to review it and make up their own minds or choose to ignore it. My friends and family in UK and US are waiting to book to visit Singapore. They have all delayed. They have bookmarked this thread to monitor it and will book their trips as they usually do using tripadvisor when things calm down a bit eg DORSCON reduces from Orange. I have put in alot of effort to maintain it. I'm not going to discontinue to update it or amend title as I see it still as valid. I suggest to let everyone make up their own mind. Let other threads be closed depending on TA or the authors. This one goes on.Thank youEdited: 8:39 am, February 18, 2020 "
Thanku for advice guys !
Most Welcome Gururaj. Take care
"I don’t agree “the situation is under control”, I agree it’s being controlled as best as it can be, which isn’t quite the same thing.Every day more new cases in other countries around the globe, including Singapore, are being discovered. Singapore is doing an excellent job, life goes on, precautions being ever more observed, but I think this is a long way from “under control”.Just my opinion."
"ddiggs, yes noted. I hear you.As cases rise, and they haven't dropped yet, fear will rise. This is inevitable. When I say control - i mean under DORSCON ORANGE control. Measures have been implemented to limit communal spread which so far seem to be doing a good job. Everywhere i go, things smell cleaner, people are practising higher levels of hygiene. I get temperature tested twice a day and I don't mind it now. Its for a purpose. Safety first.Considering that each infected person, could infect up to 4 others on average our case numbers (up to 81 today) are better than I expected just a week ago when cases were growing by 10% on average ( now 5%). I am hopeful for a sustained decline or a slower growth rate. I am hopeful of a reduction from DORSCON Orange. This may not come soon, but it will come.What also gives me confidence is being in a country, a small city state, which punches above its weight - that even when the PM says ""guys we might be heading for a recession due to Covid 19 but our efforts to contain, quarantine will be continue to be sustained to a highest standard possible!"" The PM puts safety first. Nice guy! Got to hand it to him!"
"One small piece of good news over the last two days is that the number of active cases actually dropped slightly. Specifically, over the last two days, there have been more people that have recovered and been discharged (10) than new cases confirmed (6)."
"CWB71, quite right and well noted.However, It remains to be seen if this trend continues. There may be shocks ahead which we cannot predict now. Eg carriers who dont know if they’re infected acting as spreaders. Having been monitoring closely, I can only see this getting worse before it gets better in terms of cases infected. I have though noted recoveries improve from 1 in 4 infection to 1 in 3 on average. In terms of impact on daily life, caution and vigilance has increased but this is good as communal spread risk is reduced proportionately."

"So in the building where i live Management has just put up a notice telling us: ""..we have been following up with MOH on a suspected case of COVID-19. MOH informed us that the test result is usually known within 3-4 days...The Management will also continue to compliment appropriate measures based on MOH guidelines such as Temperature taking of residents & non residents (including contractors and deliverymen)Increased frequency of cleaning of all common areas..etc etc""While this is a bit disconcerting..i need to counter that with the following: 1. this is only a ""suspected case"" and not a confirmed case.2. For some days now, hand sanitisers have already been placed in all lifts, you can smell the detergents every day from the increased cleanings of common areas3. They are being transparent (why else would they put up a big sign?), open and proactive about it, which i truly appreciate.I can see all that can be done is being done.

"Hi Bill, you sure have an exciting life :)There's one twist from all this increased personal hygiene. When we visit Singapore we nearly always have a cough or cold for a few days (at best). This time we've been scrubbing ourselves every few hours, and we've been free of all infections.We're also taking a lot more care about washing our faces. The idea is to rub the viruses off the skin (like when washing our hands) not just give them a gentle wash, so a good rub over our faces, much more than we used to do.We still reckon it's better in Singapore than other countries in the region. Public toilets are clean with good handwashing facilities, so it's much easier to practice good hygiene."
"Last night I got an email from Scoot for a flight that I have tomorrow that they are now waiving their change fees until end of May if I wanted to change my flights.I presume this is good news for some as it looks as though the Singapore Airlines group have now made a policy.From the email:Scoot understands there may be uncertainty around travelling in the current situation, so we would like to offer you a one-time free date change on your existing booking. We hope this will give you the confidence to travel whenever you are ready."
"Hi Klopptastic,Firstly, you support the best Footy team on the planet. Im not a supporter but i recognise brilliance when i see it!

Now that it has been confirmed that incubation period is in excess of 27 days instead of 14.....how many people are going to come forward with even mild symptoms or inform where they have been for fear of enforced quarantine*.

"Yesterdays cases in Singapore: 1 was on the flight from Wuhan, so has been in quarantine. 1 was a member of the church group, only 1 caught it from an unknown source. Singapore is doing very well at getting a nasty outbreak under control.Checking Google today, most sources still say 14 days is the maximum incubation period. But https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/02/5… and a few others quote a Chinese source saying it's up to 27 days.My wife saw a BBC article (she thinks it was the BBC) on this a few days ago, and they suggested that the long incubation might mean they were exposed again to the virus without that exposure being traceable.My mother told me I had one of the childhood viruses which you only catch one, twice. With so many cases, we can expect oddities.There are going to be all sorts of nasty frights before this is under control. But this forum is about Singapore, so that's what we need to focus on."
"Any ""experts"" have comments about this article below: ""https:/…9318_United_States_flu_season""79,4xx died related to flu in 2017-2018 in USA.Just wanna know the comparison between those number n Covid-19 deaths."
"There are no health experts here and let’s not turn a travel forum into a disease discussion forum. The virus is new and there are many rumours and speculative theories out there. Until the data/information is tested/studied/confirmed without a doubt, what can one achieve spreading such information on the forum other than increasing worry, fear and paranoia? The authorities and scientists around the world are working as best as they can with an unknown and as they find out and understand more about the virus, they will adjust accordingly."

"Good News: for the frst time in a long time - no new cases to report in Singapore. Secondly, with even 89 cases, zero casualties!Official Singapore Government COVID 19 status 23/2/20:""Singapore's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) level has been at orange for two weeks, since Feb 7. Orange means the disease is severe with transmission, but is generally contained, and has moderate to high public health impact.""Let me just repeat that, cos its worth repeating - NO NEW CASES ! (as of 12 noon today). Zero Casualties!This is remarkable in itself because other countries are reporting higher numbers of the virus coming in from virtually nowhere, like South Korea and Italy. In those affected countries, they were *perhaps* not as proactive as Singapore in raising of threat level to DORSCON ORANGE (one below Red) and in enforcing the strict quarantine of cases effected with all borders secured with heightened measures.Now just because there are no new cases, doesn't mean we got this licked!What matters most is that this trend continues. As soon as we open travel doors, the risk of further infections opens up because other countries are still playing catch up on containment and quarantine. Also some people with mild symptoms do not report and get quarantined. Hence they remain active and unaware as carriers.S.

"Yes, how can that help if we had cancelled the trip. Please guide"
"“ Problem is which thread to use for information?”These are not “health guide” forums, they are travel forums that discuss, assist and give travel information.Any health guidance is from a non professional point of view. I certainly wouldn’t base any of my health concerns with anything or anyone on a travel forum. Yes we can all opine, but that’s all it is, an opinion. News broadcasters/TV, newspapers and governments are the places to go for health concerns, not travel forums."
"MRahul, I’m sorry you see no value here. I think your input is valuable even if you dislike mine. Respect your opinion but disagree. Thank you. ddiggs - when this thread began we were 3rd. We even moved up to 2nd in that time. It’s a very fluid situation which can change on any day. The content has been regularly maintained and updated. Thank you .Let’s move on shall we."
"Bill, what does “Delay” mean? BTW, in my opinion the title of this thread was overly dramatic and, again in my opinion, has done Singapore more harm than good. It’s doesn’t matter how many times we say Singapore is safe, the title suggests otherwise, “3rd highest in the world” .It looks like an alarm bell. Just my opinion."
Its good to post useful information but members getting into an extended debates to prove their point does not add any value to the discussion and obscures the genuinely good information posted elsewhere in the thread. It is not necessary to counter every post that is in disagreement with yours.
""" It’s a very fluid situation which can change on any day. ""I think that is the point people are trying to make. When you post this it was the situation at the time but now nearly 3 weeks along things have changed and to be honest are people going to go through 150 posts to find out what's what. The pinned post contains links to useful websites that give you up to date info on the situation and as none of us are professionals surely it makes sense to follow them and not "" if I was you "" posts."
"If that's all you have to say, I hope you have now ended your tirade, and your relatives will understand that they have been missing out on their holiday because of you.Why Tripadvisor has let this run I have no idea."
"What makes Tripadvisor so great as a community is our diversity of opinion. Everyone is welcome to your own opinion even if you disagree with mine. I do not work in the travel industry. I have nothing to gain from it. Where i stand is on the side of DORSCON ORANGE and all the measures taken to limit communal spread. It just so happens I'm cautious and I believe prevention is better than cure. Again, feel free to disagree. When this threat level is lowered, this thread will go away by itself. Until then kindly respect my right to have my opinion just as i respect yours which may differ.I was one of the first to link Minxbaby's thread to more than 10 other newcomer threads before it was made a sticky. I saw value in it, asked for its creation, and I have strongly supported it since. Yes i have argued with others who got fed up answering the same question from newcomers, but to me, if it helped just one person, then it was worth it. And it did help more than one.This is wholly my opinion based on my subjective experience. To date, one Coronavirus case at work, a friend. One self quarantine. One suspected case of Coronavirus in the building where i live. Still have not been told if its positive.See Post #117. Adaptation to that reality was at first a shock. I was torn between wanting to be as carefree as i was in my 3 brilliant years living life in Singapore prior to Coronavirus, and shocked when something so dangerous hits someone you know and then again another scare when you go home and see a signboard from your building management saying a suspected case has happened at home...where you felt most safe. I have adapted as we all must, its the new ""normal now"" as is the temperature testing twice a day and on every entry and exit, the increased hygiene, and other measures.When we rate reviews there's a scale 1-5. If you think I am one star or 5 stars, it makes little difference to me.Tripadvisor is a community of diverse opinions and hundreds of threads with mixed views, some repeated views, some with incorrect titles, all of these and many more, that you are free to choose from. That's actually what makes it so great! You are welcome to explore them.If this one is of disinterest, please select another that is of interest. Thank you"
"So how is life here if you are visiting? Nothing is closed. Its still all open. Queues are down as expected. COVID 19 remains under control.Todays Channel News Asia carries an article which from my personal experience i dont wholly agree with. In CBD today for instance, I was in a shopping mall and it was Id say at least half full. Article refers to ""near empty"" but I'm not sure of the locations it refers to. Have a read and make up your own mind here:""The Big Read: A month into COVID-19 outbreak, retailers, eateries are reeling from near-empty malls and streets""https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…Good News:Only 1 new case today, taking infections up to 90. A magical 47 recoveries ( almost 1 in 2 is recovering from this thing - wow! )Bad News. 7 are now critically ill. Pray that they recover soon!"
"I like reading this thread, so please keep up with updating it. My holiday is booked for April and I am facing the dilemma whether to pay up or not. I've only paid the deposit so far. if I cancel now, BA won't refund the deposit. However I find whole situation very stressful and it might be better to lose the deposit.I am really not disputing that Singapore is safe. But there is much more to an enjoyable holiday than that. My worry is that I will get stopped if I have temperature for other reasons. I may end up in hospital and the insurance company may not pay. Attractions may close. Flights may get rescheduled. It is super stressful and no wonder tripadvisor is full of these threads. Not just the Singapore forum."
"We were thinking of going (only 8 days left till flight), but with all the new cases in S.Korea, Italy and Iran thinking of moving whole trip to the end of November/December.Not scared of virus itself as much, but being stuck somewhere in quarantine and perhaps not enjoying holidays as much as well. Still not decided, but wife thinks better to go later this year."
"There's n0 guarantee it will be over by the end of this year. A vaccine is unlikely to be available by then, see https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/ch…In the end you must make your own decision. The risk of quarantine has worried me too, what a waste of money to be shut up on holiday!"
">>My worry is that I will get stopped if I have temperature for other reasons. I may end up in hospital and the insurance company may not pay. Attractions may close. Flights may get rescheduled<<If you have a temperature for other reasons you'll be checked out by a doctor who will be able to determine what you have. You'll NOT be sent straight to hospital and treated as if you have covid-19.Does your current travel insurance not cover for covid-19? If not you better get some that does. My travel insures sent a policy amendment saying that their policy would cover it as does my health insurance if I'm hospitalised here.As for ""attractions closing"" if you mean places such as USS they're still open. It's the free attractions where there's larger gatherings and little chance of checking peoples temperatures that have stopped. e.g. SpectraFlight's are still coming into Singapore, I don't know of any airline that's stopped flying here. BA still has it's two flights a day.The decision is still up to you though. All we can do is answer any questions you may have about the situation here."
"I appreciate any and all comments from people who live there. I find the different perspectives interesting.Ya know, if you cancel a trip to Singapore and go somewhere else, you could be walking into the next coronavirus hotspot. Who would've thought Italy would suddenly have so many cases? If a country has zero cases, you have to wonder if they're actually testing anyone. At least with Singapore you know they're doing everything possible to contain it."
"Regarding waste of money is not too bad for us - Singapore Air agreed to move flight to later this year, most hotels I can cancel or move dates so not much out of the pocket.I'm not panicking, just trying to assess the current situation and make a rational decision. At the end of the day, if we decide to go later this year, Singapore/Vietnam will still be there and maybe holiday will be more relaxed, instead of looking over the shoulder at each sneeze suspiciously. :)"

"The Minister is simply saying that if many countries around the world are having widespread infections, it will not be practical to ban travellers from the affected countries and the strategies and corresponding alert level will have to change. It is not going to happen so soon but I think it is quite likely. We may have to learn to live with having this virus lurking around until such time as a vaccine becomes available."
"The number of cases is increasing, but the number of people in hospital being treated is decreasing. This is because more patients are recovering and being discharged than there are people becoming infected. Today it is two new cases, but four people discharged from hospital. So, while there have been 91 cases, the number still being treated is 31 (according to the news on the radio a few minutes ago). Even so, I expect we will stay on Orange for quite a while as a precaution."

Hi in just curious I'm flying out to bali in September via Singapore my concern is not flying into singapore as I'm coming from south africa but rather when I arrive in bali coming from Singapore that they would be a problem that I flew via Singapore I know its months away and I've paid all my holiday reservations so I cant cancel but what is your opinions on this?
"Hi Natasha,Firstly, July is a long way away yet, the situation can change daily. As such, strongly suggest you monitor for updates *Singapore end* here:https://tinyurl.com/wjs4fqzFor *Bali end*, as of today, you might have more of a problem if you traveled via China to anywhere in Indonesia than if you just traveled via Singapore:  ""Indonesia has refused entry to 118 foreigners, including two from Singapore,...The measure was applied from Feb 5 to 23 at all immigration gates across the country...Among the reasons for the refusal were that the foreigners had stayed or transited in mainland China for 14 days,"" https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/co…Hope this helpsBill"

"So I have been to Myanmar, Singapore, Japan, and Thailand this past month. Currently in the Maldives. This whole thing is blown out and I feel really bad for the tourism. When I landed in Yangon, there was a China airlines flight that just landed. I did not feel any less safer. I bought over $200 of masks for this trip and only used one upon landing in Tokyo and realized that it was not needed."
"Bruno wow that's actually very exciting. Thank you for confirming that. Wishing you continued safe travels ahead! Take care.Edited: 1:21 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Bill, what am I not understanding? “ Bruno wow that's actually very exciting. Thank you for confirming that.”.What is “actually very exciting” and what is Bruno “confirming”? Of course I also wish Bruno well, but I don’t understand your response . Clearly I must be missing the point, perhaps you might clarify what it is you’re saying."
"ddiggs, I don't understand Bruno's post as well. Whether someone feels safe or not is subjective, and everyone is different.If he had described what was actually happening around him at those places he has visited, and had described what measures had been taken at those locations to actually make him feel safe, then that would be better.I'm glad that Bruno feels safe, but for me, an 'elderly' person in the dangerous category medically, I'll pass on feeling safe from something that's invisible for the time being."
This thread is like a WhatsApp group!
"So just to add more insight as I wait for my flight into Kula Lumpur. Im seeing more tourists wearing masks compared to locals. Streets of Singapore are EMPTY. Not sure if that is the norm since I never been to Singapore.I would not worry much at all to be honest. Im travelling with elderly parents and they are not worried at all as well.Side note. A little mad that even though I paid a lot for hotels a few months back, the best thing they can offer me is free upgrades since many hotels have empty rooms. Thats just my rant for the day hahaha."

"@Bruno, the streets of Singapore can’t be empty since people are still going to work and school.I’m not really sure what you expect from hotels beyond room upgrades when their earnings are down and they still have to pay the staff and other business costs."
"Hi Bruno, I'm surprised you thought the streets were empty. We find everything (except tourists) is much the same as always.We were on Palawan beach last Sunday, and it was the busiest we've seen it this year (excluding CNY when we didn't head for the beach).I understand how you feel about the hotel, but many hotels are in serious trouble, and may face bankruptcy if this goes on too long. I'm in the same position. In both our cases, we entered a contract with the hotel, the hotel can't increase the price it charged us and now has no reason to reduce the price.Hope you enjoyed your time in Singapore."
""" A little mad that even though I paid a lot for hotels a few months back, the best thing they can offer me is free upgrades since many hotels have empty rooms""They did not have to offer you anything extra, what was you expecting , A lot of hotels have taken a hit did you even think about that. ?This is one of today's headlines - "" Coronavirus: Hotels closing floors, shortening service hours, sending staff on leave to cope with lull""......."

Adventurous travels encompassing Myanmar, Singapore, Japan, and Thailand - all in the same month as well“.“In awe” of someone that’s travelling from country to country, airport to airport, all of which are know to be “Virus risk zones”, and you’re “in awe” of a potential “super spreader”?

It's alright to say ""poor me"" with regard to not getting back refunds on non-refundable bookings (which people knew about when they made them), but then move on, and stop complaining, because an awful lot of people are going to suffer greatly from the economic downturn which is coming.As I've said before, businesses still want to be able to pay their employees so that those employees can take money home to their families in order to pay the bills which don't stop coming regardless of a virus outbreak.If you come across a 'bargain' price for a hotel room because they are struggling to fill the hotel, accept graciously, but please don't try and milk them for everything you can think of.This goes for other businesses as well. Please show some compassion and stop thinking about me, me, me all the time.Edited: 2:31 am, February 28, 2020 "

Lol. You definitely should not come to America as we have over 13 million influenza cases with over 6000 confirmed deaths since 2019.  I will be in Singapore in 3 weeks And if I get the flu I will just drink liquids and rest as I would any other illness

I am hoping the spring weather will wipe the virus out.Which leads me to my theory - do you think Singapore is coping so well because the virus is not thriving in the hot weather? Maybe that's why so many recover there?I just really hope this is true and the end of winter will bring relief.
"I suspect the high temperature and high humidity is helping control infection in Singapore.That's why we always sit outdoors when eating, and are planning to do indoor attractions on another visit.But for the UK, I'm not sure. I did see a comment from Official Sources they were hoping containment would work until the spring when the weather would help. But the UK is much cooler and dryer than Singapore.We'll be flying back to the UK mid March. I'm not happy about this, and feel a lot safer in Singapore."
"Like HeatSeeker, I'm nervous about our coming winter here in Australia. Last year we had an awful flu season and the hospitals really struggled to cope.Add to that the Coronavirus, and the possibility that it thrives in the cold weather, then I believe we'll be in real trouble.Anyway, our Government is at the moment rolling out the emergency stock pile of masks, protective gear and antibiotics and distributing it around the country to medical facilities in preparation for the worst scenario."

"Australia has just put entry restrictions on visitors from Iran. They have to first quarantine for 14 days in another country.Australian citizens who are returning from Iran have to self-quarantine for 14 days in Australia.This comes after an Australian citizen returned to Australia in the last few days and is now sick with the virus. Authorities say that she acted very responsibly when she realized she was sick, however she unfortunately gave a number of people facials in a beauty salon before experiencing symptoms. They are now trying to trace about 40 people who she has had contact with.I think this just brings home how easily this virus can be spread and how it can be possible to sit next to an infected person on a plane and not know it."
"Hi Susan,It strikes me that Singapore, is one of the most transparent countries in declaring cases, but other countries might not be.On Iran. now my math is wonky and *might not be correct*, but assuming a death rate of 2% and 34 recorded deaths, then i might expect Iran to declare cases closer to a number approaching 1700 give or take, than the 388 they are quoting. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. I think AUS must know this and acted accordingly.X * 2/100 = 34 = > X=34 x 100/2 = 1700 cases?Someone correct me if I'm wrong - otherwise the death rate in Iran is simply over the charts and well above 2% averageEdited: 2:31 am, February 29, 2020 "
For anyone still looking for masks i bought some n95 ones for $24 a box at Mustafa centre in Little India. They seemed to have plenty and plenty of hand santisers as well. There is still a run of these items in most pharmacies and big stores in CBD area as of today.

"I feel we're getting a problem with the way the figures are presented.As this goes on, the totals for each country are very misleading. What is much more important are the number of new cases in the last week, and in that Singapore is doing much better than other countries."
"Hi heatseeker, the existing cases are the quarantined ones. It doesnt necessarily mean they are a risk as they are quarantined. Agreed Singapore is doing a much better job of containment than lots of other countries. There are others out there who are not yet quarantined, and catching them is the key!"
"Hi Bill, the 102 cases include quite a lot who are fit and well and have left the country, fully recovered with no trace of the virus.As you say the big problem is those who are still active in the community although they have the virus. I don't think there are that many, otherwise we'd be seeing a lot more new cases. But tracking them down is a real challenge in any country.I suspect the high temperature and humidity here helps a lot, as the virus does not like these conditions. It thrives in cold dry conditions."

"Thanks for those statistics Bill. They're very telling and help to put things into perspective.Today I've made the disappointing, but not very difficult, decision to defer my trip to Singapore which is booked for the 20th of this month.If it was just Singapore that I had to be worried about, I might go, however it's being potentially exposed to the virus on the flights that I'm most worried about. Changi is a major international hub for international passengers, and it's just too big a risk to take given the escalation of cases in other countries.At the moment our Government is trying to trace people who shared flights with three people from Iran who have tested positive for the virus.I'm in the 3.6% death rate category and have multiple pre-existing medical conditions which, if I contract the disease, would potentially have me adding to that tally.Here, at home, I can isolate myself pretty well if things get really bad, as I live on a large acreage in a semi-rural area and can avoid leaving the property as long as I have enough food and medicine.I haven't made this decision lightly, because I'm generally a very positive person, but I think, given my medical problems, I have to be realistic.Good luck to all of you who go ahead with your travels, and as soon as the virus has run it's course, I'll be booking my next trip to Singapore in a flash!"

"85 countries have been affected and the list is going up every day. It means that you have a chance of catching infection even while on the way to the destination country, Focusing on the statistics and safety measures only in your destination country is getting less relevant. Its time to suspend any non-essential travel no matter where you live and where you are heading to."
"MRahul, I totally agree. We've now moved to another phase whereby you can now become infected at your own airport before you actually leave home, on the plane, when you land at your destination airport, and when you leave the airport and are out and about in your destination community.There is really no 'safe' place anymore."
I completely disagree about suspending travel. Yes it is in a lot of countries now so that means you are at risk even at home. If you follow safety measures correctly and are fit and healthy then what else can you do. If you travel to a country where it is being very well contained and take extra caution on the airplanes (Singapore airlines is taking extra caution with cleaning) then the risk of catching it is low. Can’t completely stop living your life.
"I also disagree. I think it depends on where you are coming and going from and on your health and if you are transiting between places. For me, I am flying directly from a city in NZ with no cases and landing in Singapore. I’m not particularly worried about this. Singapore itself seems relatively contained.Edited: 1:10 am, March 06, 2020 "
"By postponing you holidays for a while is not stoping living your life, just having holidays later and not taking unnecessary risks."
Not when you are unable to change flights/accomodation etc. Each to their own but I personally feel relatively safe travelling to Singapore.
"This is a ""low risk, high consequence"" event. Low chances of getting infected, but if you do get infected, the consequences can be high. Those who focus on low risk and for some reason, the ""high consequence"" factor does not appeal to them will go ahead with their trip. Those who are worried about ""high consequence"" will cancel their trip and those who are in-between will face dilemma of whether or not to go ahead. I believe in exercising abundant caution and to me, postponing travel, especially for leisure, for the time being is not such an unthinkable thing."
"Yes I agree, if you are high risk eg over 65 or have existing health issues then I would postpone or cancel. I am in my 20s and am fit and healthy so I don’t have concerns for my own health. The recovery rate for my age is incredibly high and the risk is low.Edited: 2:09 am, March 06, 2020 "
"I have to agree also. I am 50 something, slightly overweight and “past it”. What I would say is that if you really aren’t concerned through age or health then I’d come. The conditions over here are second to none. The hotels and restaurants are clean and all are exercising great levels of cleanliness. The government are ensuring that all is good over here. The locals are complying with all the conditions imposed (unlike the UK). I can’t disagree with the likes of BillUK as all he’s stated is correct although I’m sitting here drinking Tiger beer with a tourist population of about 10% of normal and think that as long as we abide by the “law of sense” then why not? I must say that the affected back home are now overtaking those in Singapore so ask myself, what am I afraid of? We all must be vigilant but any one of us can be run over by a bus. I really hope that we can all beat the virus. Hopefully it won’t be too long. Until then Panic Ye Not and carry on."
"Noticed interesting trend with this virus - when it just started a lot of people signed up to TA just to post 'don't travel' e.g spreading the panic. Now when virus is accelerating, the opposite is happening - new sign ups telling us don't worry, everything is cool and it's very safe."
Yes when it was new the virus was a foreign thing with people not knowing how it would affect their holiday. Now everyone has the virus in thier own country with more cases than Singapore and realise that life is still going own with minimal impediment

"I have a holiday booked in a couple of weeks and whilst I am ok with traveling at this time, I have heard that lots of Singapore is shut down now that the alert is now Orange. Is anyone able to confirm this is true? Are the night markets and hawker stalls closed to avoid crowding? I will mostly be on Sentosa - have any of the attractions reduced or shut down activities?Really appreciate any insights as to the situation on the ground. If I need to reschedule my travel I need to do it now to avoid penalty costs.Thanks!"

"Pompom, my opinion is flights between Singapore and Germany/France will be reduced in the coming months. Border entry restrictions are assessed on an ongoing basis so no one can tell for sure. It will depend on how bad the virus situation gets in those countries."
"Hi Travelbug - confirmed - As of now, nothing is closed. All open. Night markets, hawker centres, Sentosa, none are also closed that i know of. If anything, slightly lesser crowds means you will get served quicker.DORSCON ORANGE - is actually a good thing! It means they raised the alarm early enough for us in Singapore to be experiencing one of the best containment jobs of this virus in the world.

"Hi Pompom,Its almost futile to try to predict the future. There is no crystal ball. There are only the facts.1. There is currently NO restriction on FRANCE and GERMANY flights in and out of Singapore. As Minxbaby, this may change, but then we may also find a vaccine, and all of this goes away as quickly as it came.2. Sorry no headsup - I do not work in the travel industry. Perhaps one of the readers who does, might want to share on Pompom's ask? IMO It is best to keep monitoring Minxbaby's sticky at the top of the threads for an update. Anything else is just an opinion based on living in Singapore."
Im glad I saw this as I’m planning a trip there soon. After reading the comm nets we have decided to be safe and avoid for now. We will plan to visit next year instead.
"I am in Singapore right now as I decided to not cancel my trip here. I’ve noticed thermal temperature scanning at a lot of places (and some doing forehead temperature checks) but honestly other than that you wouldn’t know anything is going on here. Everything seems to be open although it seems very empty everywhere we’ve gone (hawker centers, zoo, aquarium, Sentosa, marina bay sands, etc) but a handful of stands at the hawker centers have been closed likely due to low crowds. We’ve been having a good time and are just making sure to use hand sanitizer anytime we touch anything and wipe down tables and utensils before eating. Overall we’ve really been enjoying our trip and the lack of crowds."
"Hi Roxybear, I’m glad you’re enjoying your trip. While some stalls may be vacant, even during the best of times, not all stalls at the hawker centres are open all the time. Some only open till lunch while some open only for dinner/supper or it could be the hawker’s rest day of the week.Edited: 6:45 am, March 09, 2020 "

"Hi Mankster,Given what’s happened so far on cruise ships, I think it’s a risk Singapore doesn’t have to take, other countries turned ships away.

">>Given what’s happened so far on cruise ships, I think it’s a risk Singapore doesn’t have to take, other countries turned ships away<<There have been no reported issues with passengers on this cruise ship and besides all passengers were initially let into Singapore before it sailed so they were already checked.Fact that they've sailed out to sea and other countries in the meantime and not picked up any additional passengers means the risk is still very low.As a correct precaution the passengers are been screened as if they were to enter via Changi againRisk assessment has been done and the Singapore government deemed it safe to let it dock.Thankfully Singapore are not applying an unfair blanket response to cruise ships.You've not complained or highlighted risk issues with Singapore accepting the 10 ships in the last fortnight. It's just because this one was turned away by Thailand and Malaysia (due to their changes in policy) that has brought it to your attention.Again Bill, please try to know the facts first...Edited: 3:20 am, March 10, 2020 "

Thanks for the update Bill. I am on a flight to Singapore today as I was unable to cancel or postpone. I will just take extra caution.

Testing clinics have opened and we're awaiting the results of the tests.I had a Doctor's appointment this morning, but it was cancelled because she called in with symptoms of a cold and decided to be cautious and not go to work just in case it was the virus.The implications for huge disruptions when the virus really gets a hold on the community is enormous and I hope that we can, like Singapore, contain it for as long as possible so that it doesn't surge suddenly like it has done in some other countries.I think that it's not advisable for anyone to travel anywhere unless absolutely necessary at this time because the risk of getting caught up in a border closure or sudden airline cancellation is very real.Traveller2255 best wishes for safe travel."

Thank you for the update Susan. Things changing dramatically in just a few days. I trust that world governments working together with the WHO can stem the tide of this Pandemic and that it can be controlled very soon...
"It’s not going to be “controlled very soon”. At best we’re months away from this virus being “controlled”. It hasn’t begun to “peak” yet, even less lowering. Stop telling people “it’s safe to travel”. No one knows the answers to the questions yet. 15-20 millions jobs worldwide in the travel related businesses are threatened. We are going to have to take an economic hit. We’re going to lose money, what we’re not going to do is find a solution anytime soon.Advice given is mostly driven by the advisor’s economic interests. We tend to hear and believe what we want to believe."
"The fact that WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic just yesterday means they are worried that the worst is yet to come. Most of us living today have probably not experienced a pandemic.

"MRahul, I'm taking an ultra cautious approach also at the risk of looking stupid. I'm too old to worry about what people think of me anyway. I think that a lot of people here in Australia, where the virus is just beginning to make its presence felt, might feel that my social distancing and enhanced hygiene habits are a bit of overkill, but I've got to do what my gut instinct tells me to do to try to keep myself and those around me safe.Our Prime Minister has declared a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, however he has stated that he will still be attending a football match which has thousands of spectators on the weekend.So, is the message that you're safe on Sunday, but not on Monday. Go figure!I wish that we were receiving the same clarity of advice and decisive action that the Singapore Government has implemented."
"Observe your own advice Bill. “ BOTTOM LINE. Singapore is an amazing place! It will still be amazing and safer after the scare has passed. You need to wait it out but it’s your choice. This is just a warning and not an official one. None of my loved ones coming, be sure to protect you and yours”.You’ve consistently told people “Singapore is fine, safe or normal” or words not dissimilar, which indeed is not untrue, Singapore is the most amazing of destinations, but “fine, safe and normal” it is not. I’ve been Skyping with my mate Ivan, who works in the city and he tells me things are anything but “normal”, is he lying to me? You live there Bill, tell me your opinions, are things “normal”?Is this a time YOU WOULD CHOOSE to holiday in Singapore, or have your friends and family holiday?You’re telling everyone else things are fine.

""Bill post 322 12/3/20. @Traveller2255. “I dont think you have much to worry about since we are at DORSCON ORANGE not DORSCON RED.

I’m confused by much of your posts and English is my first language, how others for whom English may not be, I shudder to think what they must make of it.FYI , Singapore is now 21st or 22nd NOT 3rd nor has it been since the day this thread was posted."
Advice means nothing for insurance. I have been told even if they close the borders it still doesn’t make a difference as written into the fine print of insurance is does not cover pandemic. It is a terrible situation for families who have saved up for a trip to lose out.

Does not fit into Group 1 or has decided, independently, on plus and minus to come regardless.GROUP 1 unequivocal delay.GROUP 2, respect/adapt to DORSCON Orange measures when here. As nothing is yet closed you will enjoy it. By adapt i mean awareness of my Group 2 criteria.When this thread was created, we were 3rd in the table on number of cases in the world. This thread was later closed by those who perhaps worked in the travel industry and complained that my early advice to delay was akin to fear mongering. In hindsight, with WHO Pandemic confirmation, the advice to delay, was always IMO bang on for Group 1.On life in CBD - 9-5 Mon - Fri pretty much same people traffic going to/from work. Lunchtimes near normal busyness observed in shopping mall. Lau Pa Sat down around 30% twice when i visited this week ( 2 evenings) They have sanitiser in stock in Fair Price I noticed.I was also bit tipsy a few times when i posted, happy at George's beach bar, wishing the world would return to the joy of pre-Covid 19 and handshakes....Thank youBill"
"Hi PositiveNegative,You are correct. Amended.Bill"
"Thank you for the amendment, and your admission of being ‘tipsy a few times’ for your posts. At least now will have the prudence when reading your posts should (IMO) contradictory statements be encountered.Edited: 12:39 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Welcome PostiveNegative, always willing to amend / delete my own post where i was incorrect. As for advice - its depends on the group of traveler as set out below."
"Hey bill, what about the advice to delay travel because we’re 3rd highest for number of cases is that still a valid updated advice or that it has past its due date, and henceforth IMO contradicting?Edited: 1:31 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Hi PositiveNegative - i did try to change that but TA advised titles could not be changed so i kept it and simply focus on updating content. I'm not paid for this and i dont work in the travel industry either. Errors are mine and I appreciate it when you point them out and if i can correct them, i will."

"SINGAPORE BELOW FRANCE AND GERMANY, ABOVE UK IN CASES PER 1M POPULATION.I thought it was interesting and that it might help someone who is thinking of travelling to Singapore to view a table below which i have taken the time to recreate. It shows a different view of cases than usual as it is ranked according to the number of cases per 1 Million population in each country.1. Does this mean UK is currently **safer** than Singapore because it has a bigger population?2. Does this mean or that France and Germany are more risky?I deliberately leave the above as questions which only you can answer as it really depends on what criteria you prefer to call ""safety"" or ""risk""Review and make up your own minds.

"BillUK32, while my current recommendation is to avoid non-essential travel to all destinations to minimise global spread, may I respectfully request that you stick to facts and avoid doing extrapolation about what the future number of cases in Singapore might be? The graph will never be linear and speculation is not going to do anything to improve the situation. All we can do right now is be vigilant with personal hygiene, monitor our health and be socially responsible.A focus on the total number of cases gives one the wrong picture of the current situation since the number is always going to go up until this virus goes away completely and some patients have already recovered. Whether intended or nor, it diminishes the frontline efforts to treat those patients.Given a new cluster has been discovered recently through contact tracing, a bigger increase in the number of cases can be expected and as the virus becomes more prevalent in other countries, there will also be imported cases. At present, the increase here still lags behind a great many countries."
"Hi Minxbaby,Noted on the extrapolation. I made sure to point out this was **IMO** only. The first 102 cases took around 37 days, we reached 200 cases around 16 days after. I was a bit shocked not by the number of cases, but by the increase in growth rate.Agreed that most newspapers and authorities monitoring the spread of Covid 19 have a fixation on the number of cases as the main agreed metric. The trouble with this is that not all cases have been tested and brought to attention as some countries are less transparent and less proactive in implementing contact tracing, social distancing and related measures. Some carriers dont know they are carriers as symptoms are mild.In post #355 i take an alternative view - cases per 1M population and I ask questions for which i do not have answers. But if this view is taken, and the link provides it, then a different picture emerges in that France and Germany > Singapore > UK.It would be very interesting to see a table of active cases per 1M and see what picture emerges then. Perhaps someone else might like to contribute that.Thank youBillEdited: 12:52 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Hi Bill, while I do respect different opinions and it’s obvious that you have taken some effort to come up with such a table, but my question is this; Am sure you are aware of the inaccuracies of extrapolation in statistics and the unpredictability in factors, particularly that of the future, which is why it is usually not recommended as such. What then is the basis of linear extrapolation? Why not logarithmic? Exponential? Question is how do and would you know? Note: My other question is not directed to you, but rather a general comment in that if inaccuracies do matter to some, then why do the heading stay as such being 3rd highest? Though I do understand that you (bill) can’t change it as you had already explained previously."
"Hi PositiveNegative,On titles, many are out of date in the tripdavisor universe but it doesn't mean the content is. Have updated here regularly since Feb 6th. Personally, if it were possible, i would amend the title but it is not an option. Therefore any further criticism of it and the many other titles which are out of date, is moot.My bottom line and my advice, group dependent, has not changed.Personally again, whats more interesting for me to note, is not any extrapolation or inaccuracies within it (linear underestimates exponential which might actual fit data better) but actual data of say Active cases per 1M population. If you or someone else comes across a table for this, I would appreciate it if you would kindly share.Nearest i could find - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Thank youBillEdited: 1:50 am, March 14, 2020 "
“ linear underestimates exponential which might actual fit data better...”Err....fit what data better? Future data? Question comes back again; How would you know?
I also think this thread should be closed as the heading is misleading and causing confusion.... Same applies to the recent content.Ramblings from a person obviously obssessed or an unhealthy fetish to be listened to.

"Bill, I’ve been a member of this community for 13 yrs, come April. Not everyone agrees with everything I post, nor indeed do I agree with everyone’s posts or advice, but the one thing I have in common with most people is that we respect one another and sometimes we really like one another and form friendships that have lasted for years.This ridiculous thread, which has so many misinformed posts by you, so many deleted posts by you and so many apologies and corrections by you, as to make it impossible for people to follow.You’ve upset so many people with your arrogant refusal to close this thread, that you will NEVER be accepted into this community.That’s fine if that’s what you want. If however you want to be part of the community, instead of someone that is causing so much disharmony, you need to think very carefully about what it is you’re doing.If you have no respect for other posters, many of whom have been here for years, fine, carry on as you are.There are many, many regular posters that have never posted on this thread, nor will they. There are many posters that will never respond to you posts because of the damage this thread has done to our community.It’s up to you Bill, if as you’ve said on several occasions, you don’t care what people think, then carry on. I’m nobody, just a chap that wants to help people get the most from their Singapore experience. Your grossly inaccurate numbers and opinions have little if anything to do with helping people have the best trip they can.This is not an online schoolroom, statistics mean nothing, especially if they are incorrect in the extreme.Clearly you have little, if any, understanding of exponential growth. Your numbers are just wrong and misleading.As I said before, clearly you know how to communicate, but you have to do so accurately, something thus far for this community, you have failed spectacularly to do."

I’ve had my say, I have nothing more on the matter to say, other than you, I have little doubt, will be an asset to our community with your communication skills. I don’t want to keep the pot boiling, but I do want our community to return to “normal”, and continue doing what we do best of all.The Singapore forums are recognised as some of the best forums TA have, that’s a reputation that has been EARNED over many years. This is a silly blob that has made a lot of people cross. It won’t be the last and it’s not the first. Life happen even on one of the best forums on TA. Be safe.

In early stages, it declared that ""Singapore is deserted"" and at the same time that ""people are lined up for hours for at drug stores."" Both these statements were disputed by other posters who live in Singapore.It would seem reasonable that, since Singapore is not ""3rd highest in the world"" and indeed not even 20th highest in the world, it be recognized that this thread is dated and needs to sink to oblivion.As noted by another, things move quickly, and you are better off to ask a question for the DE's to answer."

Personally I find the daily report a little too long-winded. Why not just 1) heading1hyperlink2) heading 2hyperlink etc?Just my own opinion as a suggestion.
"agreed will try to shorten.On goto facts, anyone is welcome to suggest what they think is fake/incorrect so long as you can put up a source to verify it - criticism without a source is invalid. I will acknowledge and undertake the update without fuss.This way we can at least be constructive as a community rather than on opposite sides. I am sure we all want safety first, caution first, essential travel only, at this time.When this phase has passed. I will be happy to close this thread, and use my spare time for the charities i support.Edited: 7:25 am, March 15, 2020 "
"In the last 9 pages there are at least 22 deleted posts. How can anyone follow this thread with over 20% of the posts deleted. It’s absurd, it’s impossible to follow, it needs deleting. None of it makes any sense to anyone new looking for sensible coherent advice with over 20% of posts missing."
"Id suggest new users only look at the last page, first page - they dont have to trawl through the non relevant, outdated parts. Unfortunately, i do not have the tools to1. Amend title2. Re-order or delete off topic posts"
Spend your spare time on those charities now. They need you more than we do.
"You remove your own posts frequently. I'm not sure why this isn't a red flag for TA.In any event, 'your' information (such as it is) cannot be relied on when, in the future, you're as likely to remove the post as not."
It is AGAINST the rules. This thread WILL be deleted.

What little personal experience of Singapore’s state of confusion you’ve added to the thread leaves me wondering if you’re even in Singapore.

"Anyone can choose to travel if they are able, if they are permitted, based on their own risk assessment. Much like Singapore does, they will be subject to testing, scrutiny at every checkpoint, possible SHN quarantine, or even refused entry. Those are some of the risks. There may be more.In post 451 - I do also ask everyone to consider ""The NEXT key question that should guide your decision is – is your travel essential right now or can you delay?Further, in a recent article in NYT - this question was also asked. Advice given by an expert below: Link provided to help you decide.Coronavirus Is Spreading. Should You Cancel Your Vacation?Michael Mina, M.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “If it were me, I think I would probably try to decrease my risk as much as possible, and one way to do that is reducing travel.”Note the expert does not go as far as saying everyone should stop travel, period.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/parenting…"
"“ Anyone can choose to travel if they are able, if they are permitted, based on their own risk assessment“.NO THEY CANNOT.What about my right and everyone’s right to be protected from people STUPID ENOUGH to travel?In Italy a few moments ago, the Italian government has said if you stand in the middle of a football field / park on your own doing exercise, or words that affect, you WILL BE arrested . STAY HOME, DO NOT TRAVEL."
"“ When you have read post #451, with many facts laid out for you, make up your own minds“What about my right, your rights “gardengirl”, your brother’s rights, my grandson’s rights and everyone’s right to be protected from people STUPID ENOUGH to travel ? “Make you own minds up”. I don’t think so. Some minds have to be made up by intelligent people loving enough to protect the stupid people, of which there are it seems, any number of the little darlings.And yet “gardengirl” posts on another thread, and I quote EXACTLY.“we should be thinking of others more than ever”.Or another yet another thread; “ I feel strongly that nobody should be (traveling) unless it’s imperative”Which is it? Make your own mind up, or think of others more than ever ? You cannot do both."
"It’s a bit like a government health warning on a pack of cigarettes. You can stick as big a warning on it as you want, but some, as is their right, will still choose to smoke.Some will still choose to travel, regardless of WHO or DORSCON, if legally permitted.Edited: 8:00 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Governments and airlines around the world are taking that choice away so it’s not even worth arguing about. Bill, I actually wrote a long post with some suggestions the other day but when I tried to post it the thread had already been closed. In short, do you not think it might be a good idea to at least keep your threads to a week long time frame? Just open a new one every week, no new readers are going through 460 posts anyway. Keeps the readers better informed on the current situation and may help to restore forum harmony."

"Further to #468, this means that the previous SHN that applied to tourists no longer applies - this appears to be a BLANKET BAN effective Monday.[MOH]: Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore, save they were issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival. This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. Yesterday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore."

This may or may not be revised, and further measures introduced, depending on MOH announcement. 3. This follows a more than doubling of cases in Singapore from March 15th ( date of my last update) and March 21 (yesterday) to 432.

"Hi BillNow that short term visitors are no longer allowed in, I think this thread can be put to rest. Whatever happens to the DORSCON level is irrelevant to these visitors.When the situation gets better enough to allow visitors such as your friends and relatives, you can either start a new thread or inform them via whatever means you are using currently. You can even start a Watsapp group just for them if you feel the need to provide them with continual updates.Cheers."

It’s such a shame that a well liked and friendly forum has become so flawed. It is the title of this thread that is causing the issue as it is out of date and now totally inaccurate. For folk living in countries like Italy and Spain it is just plain offensive when we have thousands dead. I implore the author to please now put it away.

"Please give it a rest ccC! This thread will meet a natural end if people let it go. There are people dying all over the world as you merrily play your games. There is no place anymore for this idiotic dialogue. This forum, and the others across the globe should be here to help travellers. Some people are stuck a long way from home, others are frantic to get home to dying family members and your response is to choose to engage in this pointless war of words. Please think on that and how others perceive your words. Thank you for your compassion."

"Goodness, I’ve never seen a thread like it, particularly in the typically professional and so well organised Singapore forum."
Just don't bother to report this thread and stop posting anymore replies. Let that one person do whatever he wants to.

"I politely post this on the 14th March. 14 Mar 2020, 15:51Bill, I’ve been a member of this community for 13 yrs, come April. Not everyone agrees with everything I post, nor indeed do I agree with everyone’s posts or advice, but the one thing I have in common with most people is that we respect one another and sometimes we really like one another and form friendships that have lasted for years.This ridiculous thread, which has so many misinformed posts by you, so many deleted posts by you and so many apologies and corrections by you, as to make it impossible for people to follow.You’ve upset so many people with your arrogant refusal to close this thread, that you will NEVER be accepted into this community.That’s fine if that’s what you want. If however you want to be part of the community, instead of someone that is causing so much disharmony, you need to think very carefully about what it is you’re doing.If you have no respect for other posters, many of whom have been here for years, fine, carry on as you are.It’s up to you Bill, if as you’ve said on several occasions, you don’t care what people think, then carry on.I’m nobody, just a chap that wants to help people get the most from their Singapore experience.Your grossly inaccurate numbers and opinions have little if anything to do with helping people have the best trip they can.Clearly you have little, if any, understanding of exponential growth. Your numbers are just wrong and misleading.As I said before, clearly you know how to communicate, but you have to do so accurately, something thus far for this community, you have failed spectacularly to do.Added today.Only a person of breathtaking arrogance and total disregard of other people’s feeling, would continue posting.Edited: 7:12 am, March 24, 2020 "
ddiggs This was already replied to in post #449. Thank you.
"This thread paints a false picture about Covid 19 situation in Singapore through a factually incorrect and misleading subject.

It must be mentioned that OP had also started a thread this morning with factually incorrect subject which indicated that there was lockdown in Singapore. This thread has since been removed.
The OP would mow his lawns at 7am on a Sunday if his local council allowed it.
"As much as OP's stubbornness, the manner in which TripAdvisor has dealt with this thread is most disappointing. What merits do they see in retaining this thread?I have raised TA's attention to this thread through a different channel and hope to hear their views.Edited: 11:15 am, March 24, 2020 "
"This thread's topic is Singapore - Coronavirus. Please stay on topic. We have had enough posts deleted for harassment or bring off topic already ( about 20 of them recently). Lets not add to them.Anything you want to discuss offtopic, any criticisms etc, this is not the place - PM me instead. I will reply there.Thank youEdited: 1:20 pm, March 24, 2020 "

"Bill32UK, With no visitors likely to arrive in Singapore in the near future, would you care to clarify the purpose of continuing your posts on this topic? Have you taken upon yourself the responsibility of educating Singapore residents on what their government is doing for them?"
"Hi MRahul, please call me Bill,Its true no visitors are likely to come soon. But let me do my best to answer your very good question.Firstly, I have colleagues from work who are new to Singapore and extended their work period here because of Coronavirus and travel restrictions in their home countries. They have all bookmarked this thread as part of their update and they all use Tripadvisor for restaurant reviews as well. Secondly, my friends and family around the world, have also bookmarked this thread, like to keep updated on Coronavirus events in Singapore. They delayed their trip early on, on my advice, as some had kids, some of the older ones with pre-existing conditions, but they are using Tripadvisor to book and plan their visit. The only question is when. I hope its soon!Should you have any criticism of this thread, i welcome you to PM me. I promise to reply. Can we all stick to topic please. As said, anyone with off topic chat, please PM me.Thank youEdited: 4:03 am, March 27, 2020 "
