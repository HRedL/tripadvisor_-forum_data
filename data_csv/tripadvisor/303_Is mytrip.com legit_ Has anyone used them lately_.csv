"I can almost 100% guarantee that the price isn't live and that once they have your details the price will mysteriously change until you are paying as much as or more than if you'd booked with the airline, and with much more hassle.You know that old saying? If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is? It applies. Heavily.Just book with the airline and save yourself some stress."

"Yes - read on;Mytrip claims to be an IATA accredited online travel agency.They advertise an English helpline number +44 8447747881 but it now appears to us that this is only a front for a Greek company, We booked flights with them on 9 February 2016 on Iberia Airlines (Madrid to Lisbon) and their subsidiary Air Nostrum (from Malaga to Madrid) . Mytrip.com immediately charged the cost of the flights to our credit card (travel card).Two weeks later the airline changed the first flight making it impossible to make the connection to the second. When we were notified we immediately requested that Mytrip.com change the flights to a practicable connection. Despite repeated emails and expensive overseas calls to the Mytrip.com ‘help line’ Iberian Airways tells us that Mytrip.com has not made any request to change the flights. Iberia Air says that they can not change the flights because Mytrip.com has not requested the change from them.Iberia Air says that we cannot miss the first flight which now does not exist and just get to Madrid some other way in order to get on the second flight. In other words there is no way we can use the tickets we have paid for.Mytrip.com does not respond to any of our emails.And furthermore, apparently an UK 844 number, which their helpline is, is a premium number which returns payment from the cost of the call to the company. (just one phone call cost us 50 euros on hold)We are now having to find alternative means of transport, of course at greater cost due to the last minute booking. So much for me thinking IATA accreditation signified anything. If anyone knows of any way we can seek help or contact this company the information would be greatly appreciated.?"
Sorry to hear your bad experience with them. Fortunately mytrip.com seemed suspicious to me so I booked a flight directly with the airline and paid an additional 100 usd - now I understand it was worthwhile.
"We used them for flights in Brazil in June, but booked in Feb. In March we were notified of a flight change on the flight going to our destination, which was ok, being only an hour difference, and the new e-tickets were sent. But then 2 weeks later we were notified of a second change, this time to the return flight, which then left us with no time to catch our international flight. I let them know immediately that it didn't suit. No response. Sent the email again several times, no response. Eventually, called the phone number and talked to an abrupt person on the other end. We did sort out an alternative, wasting virtually half a day, and bringing us into the international airport with a lay-over of 10 hours! BUT no new e-ticket! It took until well into April and many emails later before the new e-ticket was finally sent to us. Meanwhile I had to stress about whether I would have to try to arrange other flights. I don't think I would use them again!"
"Do not use mytrip. They are a fraud. I booked a flight which they claimed as refundable if canceled. But when i canceled it, they gave no refund and their customer support is also nowhere. You cannot contact them by any means. So, DO NOT USE MYTRIP.COM."
"They're real but they're kind of shady. Booked a Ticket from Amsterdam to Stockholm via Brussels. It turned out the Amsterdam-Brussels flight was a train. With a fake flight number. ""Stopping to refuel in Rotterdam Railway Station"". Nobody at the airport knew what to do with my booking printout, and Air Brussels, who supposedly ran the ""flight"" had no office in Amsterdam airport., So eventually I just got on the train. The train ticket checking guy had no idea what to do with my booking either, but couldn't be bothered so he just let it go. The Brussels-Stockholm flight was real though so that was nice."
WE have called their number in the day Nz time and it goes to Manilla Philappinnes. They have made many promises to follow up our situation but nothing has been done. We have called Mytrip.com in Uk to their Greece office and dealt with staff that have lied about availabilities that we can clearly see exist and we have called the airlines and the flights are available. We need to change 1 members flight for a medical appointment to come home a couple of days early and My trip just will not do it even after we have agreed to pay the change fee. We have no option but for that person to miss out altogether their holiday or pay out of their own pocket $700 return. DONT GET SUCKED IN BY THINKING YOU ARE SAVING A FEW DOLLARS BECAUSE IT WILL COST YOU MORE IN THE END. THESE GUYS ARE CRIMINALS.
I tried to use MyTrip.com. they had a good price. They were a complete rip off. Their cancellation policy charges you 75% of ticket price any time you cancel. Very dodgy business scheme. Stay away from MyTrip.com. This is a scam.
Do they charge you 75% or had you bought a non refundable ticket and the refund amount was taxes?Far from me to defend them but it strikes me that an OTA specialising in cheap fares isn't selling fully flexible refundable tickets
"I am dealing with Mytrip.com as we speak and the experience is NOT GOOD! I have talked to three different ""agents"", two when I called the +33975123926 number in France and one person in Greece...no help. The UK number is not in service (surprise!). These people are scammers, their webpage is misleading and it keeps increasing the price of the ticket as you go, so it ends up being 15-20% higher than originally stated. STAY AWAY FROM Mytrip AND THEIR MOTHER COMPANY IN GREECE e-TRAVEL S.A. ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCY !!!If you need more to convince you just go to Mytrip reviews and you will get a taste of this company does."
"""If you need more to convince you just go to Mytrip reviews""What a pity you did not follow your own advice."
"I used mytrip.com to book a flight and I truly regret it. There was a problem with my tickets and they were not able to provide a solution, they only managed to make me loose time and money. Also it took about 5 phone calls to make customer service react in any way to my support request. Of course the solution was that there is nothing they can do."
"I'd have to pass on ever using them again. We booked a flight from Japan to Istanbul and was later notified of schedule changes.They never responded to my emails for about two weeks. I had to call Athens from Thailand on a non toll free number only to be put on hold When I told them about the connection problem and my desire to change the flight they charged my an additional fee.The ""customer service"" via email is the worst I've ever dealt with and the only way to contact them is by phone.When I had to cancel the trip completely I was told that their refund wouldn't cover their fee.I ended up booking a second trip with Turkish airlines directly and suggest to anyone reading this to avoid them like the plague."
"They cant refund and change your flight tickets.They did mistake in my reservation(I ordered flights 16-18 May, they booked flights on 16-18 April.. and can't find enought time to change my reservation. Did they refund me their mistake? NO. bul***it!"
"They literally put my name wrong on my ticket and refuse to change it or refund us and their solution is ""pay $1200 for a new ticket there's nothing we can do"" not happy at all and have been fighting with them for weeks but now they've blocked me on all social media. Not a happy customer!"
"THE WORST AGENCY,... Don't buy from them.. They can't help you if you have any issue, it means, if everything goes well, no problem, but if the airline have any trouble, mytrip.com has no recognition by airlines, so, they will leave you alone. REPEAT.. NO BUY FROM MYTRIP.com"
Well i guess you needed that because if the trip would have gone well you would not have bothered coming on this platform to vent your frustration !

how can i sue this company. mytrip?They took 3000$ from me and i cant reach anyone from there :(I m planning my honeymoon and they r my nightmares
"NOOOOO... It is legit but is too bad.. If you buy something from them, you are alone and completely alone. Please don't buy from them."
scam I got burned.
Thanks for the posts!! i was about to book through Mytrip.com seeing the +44 prefix... glad i read the reviews.
"unfortunately if you face some problems regarding your flight, they do not respond to your requests at all.It happened to me."
Is there a way that scammed customers can make a legal case against mytrip.com. 1. to get money (or part of it) back2. getting mytrip.com off the market
"1. Maybe your card provider can assist, Robby2. There is no way of getting them off the market, except for people avoiding them and then them going bust."
"Did you get any refund yet,i'm also having problems"
"They do not respond when you face any kind of problems regarding the flight, they just drain customers' accounts ."
Did you get free hand luggage or nothing at all? I have the same problem
Did you get hand luggage or nothing at all? I have the same problem
"In short, yes they are legit, however the worst booking site I ever used.Just booked, after the booking confirmation never got a Ticket from them. I have asked the Airline who then sent me a duplicate Ticket. Furthermore, they charged heavy extra costs, inclusive a 7% for the use of Debit Card!I have tried to get in contact with them by email, NO CHANCE.My recommendation: Avoid them as I will in the future.NB: I frequently book long distance flights several times per year."
Legtimate is an entirely different thign to being good.
"I bought tickets with Mytrip.com from Belgrade to Colombo, Sri lanka. I got e-ticket 10 minutes after I paid it. Everything went well so don't have doubts to book tickets there. They are really reliable. I was very pleased with them. They are really the cheapest company."
"Don't do it. I made that mistake, they are not worth the hassle, took months to sort out my dilemma with them :s"
"Dragana, congratulations on making your forum debut here on Tripadvisor today. I hope you'll stick around and join in many more discussions about Air Travel, and do pop into other forums as well to share your experiences."
"Yes me, then cost me another £1,000 to sort my flight. Customer support is really bad, they are properly helpless and is no way to escalate to somebody else. They platform is shoddy and doesn't keep up to date the flights, this was happened in my case, furthermore if the flight operator changes the flight and you are entitled for compensation, they will hold 50 euros of it as admin fee.Edited: 3 years ago "
Andrei - bumping up all the threads you find for this company and posting duplicate posts will just result in all your posts being deleted.
"Hi, My mom and auntie has recently used the mytrip.com page to buy tickets, from Colombia to Sweden round trip. I just want to warn anyone who is buying at this site to try first other options, use it only if you have no more choice. when the moment of problems comes, they will not take any responsablity and they will send you to the airlines, then they will send you back to them, etc.... My relatives has lost their conection flights in London due to an impossible conection mytrip.com offers on their site, when no airlines will offer that. they gave no attention even the problem has been detected more than 3 weeks on advance, having around 8 emails of ocnversation and at least 4 hours of ohone calls. Again, TRY NOT TO USE MYTRIP.COM unless you have no more choice. It will give you problems."
"There is always another choice - use the airline. If the airline has no availability, then no one an book you anyway."
DO NOT BUY!I tried buying the tickets thru them cause Alitalia did not accept my credit card.The purchase was denied by my credit card and I used my husband's card to buy it thru Alitalia.Next day they used my information and charged my credit card!!!They took almost ONE month to answer me they were not refunding my money!!!!
"Be cautious, as I was billed double the air fair quoted, and my credit card was debited before I even received a confirmation of the booking I made. Not only have I yet to receive a confirmation, but it was only a after a telephone call to the US (I am in South Africa) that I received e-tickets. They now claim that the prices fluctuate and that that the amount credited to my card was the correct amount at the time of purchase. This is not true as we double checked the price. I am yet to have a resolution of this issue."
"Be CAUTIOUS,i just paid double for my tickets and their response :' The cost was less since probably some more economic seats were released by the airline system and if you research for the same flights currently the cost went up to (double ) in this case without our web discount 'Not true as the prices are exactly the same a week later with this company."
We bought Air Madagascar tickets through Mytrip.com. Air Madagascar changed the flight schedule and we could not use the new tickets. Mytrip.com did not respond to e-mails claiming a refund of the ticket cost. They were however quite helpful on the UK support number and next day I received a mail from them telling me that the tickets had be canceled and that I would receive the refund.
">>>the prices are exactly the same a week later with this company.<<<No doubt they don't have live pricing, and nor do they want to update their site as then they won't get so many travellers going there to chase cheap deals that don't really exist."
"I am really in trouble, I guess, after reading all this posts.. I booked 2 flights on mytrip.com last August to fly in December. I was notified 2 days ago that the international flight was anticipated 40 minutes but they didn't change the time table of the connexion flight .. I email t mytrip and try to call but no answer! and call centre never ring... Did anyone complain to IATA about this Mytrip.com?"
I have flown today from Baghdad to London on Royal Jordanian .I bought the ticket form My Trip and had absolutely no problem. They are based in Greece so are not open the same hours as a UK based agent
"Just to make some justice! Last week I was very upset with difficult comunication with Mytrip.com. Finally they answer and solve my problem with the flight connection. The issue of new tickets was very quick! NAtalia was very helpful.So it works, slowly but it works"
"This is a scam website that offers cheap tickets lesser than the actual airline (Mytrip, Kayak, Vayama, etc.). As for the many articles I read about this kind of site, I will reveal to you how they operate. I have called the actual airlines and verified that these websites are not affiliated in any airlines, so they do not have any special price or discount. They will buy the ticket to the airlines with the same price just like you and me. The low price you see in their websites is just a front to attract people in buying. After you pay any of these scam websites, they will send you an email about one or two days later saying that your flight is no longer available or that price have increased. Your credit card will be charged much more than what you bought.  They will not allow you to refund the payment for the booking and the best refund you can get is 50% or none at all. In the end, you will always pay up much more than buying directly to the actual airline. As for the good comments you see posted, they are all phony and those people did not actually buy from their website. There are actually websites that handles this kind of job, which I was actually offered by the way. They will pay people about 1 US cent for every good comment or rating you post."
"""offers cheap tickets lesser than the actual airline (Mytrip, Kayak, Vayama, etc.)""----None of those you mention are airlines."

"'The names I am referring in the parenthesis are the scam websites (online travel agencies), not the airlines you [edited by me]' Hm.You seem intent on missing the point. The websites you mention are not travel agencies. Neither are they scam websites, although the word is often bandied about by those who pay no attention to what they buy.'The low price you see in their websites is just a front to attract people in buying.' Yes, it's an advertisement, often including the phrase 'fares from X' which allows them to do this without any hint of a scam. 'They will not allow you to refund the payment for the booking and the best refund you can get is 50% or none at all.' This has nothing to do with the (often fairly useless) websites but rather the ticket rules, which are set by the airlines. If inept Company Z books a nonrefundable ticket with Airline T then the status of that ticket will be available to view before completing the booking. Do people read the so called fine print? Usually not, and as such they are surprised when they find that nonrefundable means that.Third party booking sites also charge fees to do what most people could do themselves: book their air tickets (or hotels or rental cars). There is usually little to no benefit in using these sites, a few of which are worthwhile but too many of which are truly dire. Nonetheless, they stay in business because advertising is potent and people are convinced they'll find a bargain."

"The regulars here already know about all the third parties you mention, no one here would book with them. Ironic you questioning someone's intelligence when it appears to be you who has carelessly booked without doing any research."
">>>I will reveal to you how they operate<<<Jojo, you really aren't telling us anything new, but well done for investigating things for yourself and reaching the right conclusions.We tell people much the same things here all the time, but not all of them are prepared to accept and face the truth of how things work.Of course, if you only starte dinvestigating because you'd already booked wiht MyTrip and encountered some sort of p[roblem, then not so well done, as you should have done it first, before parting with your money."
"Anyway I learnt a lesson, please check some information about these sites! But I wonder about IATA, Momondo, sky-scanner and so on, that always ""thrive us for this sort of sites"" , in knowledge that claims ( quite a lot) do exist! I wanted just to state that buying directly with the airline company was 500 euros more! Airlines are my first search and option.For having a new ticket in mytrip.com the fee was the administrative tax , of 27 euros, that was previously mentioned in the site."
"When I purchased the ticket, I saw the name on the ticket actually had the company name I wanted the receipt for. Contacted them, and they told me I made a mistake, which I did not. Afterwards, I asked them whether they could change the name, to which the answer was negative. When I asked for the refund, they told me that they would still charge %60 cost as service costs. I am applying for consumer court. Please do not buy ticket from them."
Wish I had read this review before. We were just duped by mytrip.com in the same fashion as yours! A very expensive lesson learned but really is there nobody to put them behind bars for such atrocities.
"I am having the same issue, I paid for flights from China to England. They changed my connecting flight, making it impossible for me to catch. They will not respond to me. There must be away to stop them through the European court."
Hi mam.I just want to ask how much ticket round trip.from HK to Gatwick. London..on the 22 of DEC to Jan.3..pls send email pls..thanks
"Mickjo, this is the public forum of Trip Advisor. We're volunteers helping fellow travellers. You need to contact airline(s) or travel agents or search online for routes and prices."
"I booked a flight from London to Stornoway, UK, with mytrip.com through Skyscanner. It was only after I booked that I realised the connection time between flights in Glasgow is only half an hour! I should have looked more closely so that is my own fault! However, I decided that I would probably not make the connection considering my age, luggage etc. I rang their helpline 08447747881 last week and spoke to someone in the Philippines! I was on the line for over 20minutes and he couldn't help me. He said he would look into things and let me know, he didn't!! Today I rang the number in Greece, using a cheap calls line, 00302130184000 and spoke to a very helpful lady called Maria. She did look into it and said the airline, British Airways, do consider this a valid turn around time, so that if for any reason I do not make the connecting flight it is their responsibility to re route me. We will see!! Lesson learned, check carefully before booking!"
"I booked a trip with mytrip.com and an error message appeared in the last screen saying ""Oops! Our servers have gone bad... An error occurred while processing your request"", the ticket didn't process although my debit card was charged for the amount. Called customer service and have been emailing but no they have been no help."
"Do NOT book your trip via this agency!!! It's not worth the extra $50-$100 you save.For one, despite having a New York number, they're based on Greece. Therefore, if you have any issues (i.e. Trip delay or cancellation) on a Friday, you can't get ahold of anyone until the following Monday!!! They're closed Saturday midday and all day Sunday, and office is only open during the day. Plus the time difference only gives you a couple hour window to make contact! Also they don't make it easy to find their location: it just says +3 time zone so I spent 30 minutes trying to find which country that was so I could calculate the time difference to call.My Friday night airline delay cost me $1500 in San Fran hotels, taxis, fare difference, food, etc because I couldn't actually get anyone on the phone until 11p Sunday!! Lastly I requested vegetarian and a window seat and they didn't communicate either of that to the airlines!! I went on a 13-hour flight without anything to eat!!!!"
"Please help me to understand.<<My Friday night airline delay cost me $1500 in San Fran hotels, taxis, fare difference, food, etc because I couldn't actually get anyone on the phone until 11p Sunday!!>>How can a delay cost you a fare difference? Or did you miss a connection or separate flight?Once you have a ticket, picking seats and ordering special diet is best make on ""manage a booking"" on the airline website.<<I went on a 13-hour flight without anything to eat!!!!>> Even if you have not made a request for vegetarian diet. I am surprised that there was no option to get some salad, vegetables, fruits, bread etc.Which airline did you fly with?"

"In October, 2017 my son booked a round trip flight to Thailand through mytrip.com. Somehow he missed his return flight. With an inadequate daily limit on his debit card he called me and asked for my credit card information. I sent him a photo of my card, front and back. He booked the return flight through mytrip. After the booking, the actual ticket could not be purchased because he was not in possession of my credit card and it was flagged as fraudulent. So, mytrip had my money, but my son had no flight to return home. Of course this all happened on a weekend. On Monday his bank raised his daily limit and he successfully caught a flight home.BUT, mytrip still had my money. In speaking to the pitiful customer service I was offered a partial refund in euros. I refused and sicced my bank on them. I am unaware at this time whether the bank has recouped their money or not, but they have refunded all charges to my account. Thank you, Bank of America. My advice is DO NOT USE MYTRIP.COM."
"So all because your son missed his flight, and the airline who he was flying home on after buying a replacement ticket required the credit card used for purchase to be shown you are blaming MyTrip?"
"The classic case of self inflicted pain topped by choosing a shonky OTA.There is no blame to the agency in your son being unable to be on time at an airport or having not enough funds on his debit card.Many airlines and agencies require a copy of the credit card (incl. signature form the owner) if a ticket is bought by a person not travelling.<<pitiful customer service>> Yep, all those OTA promising 'cheap' tickets mostly have a lousy customer service. Firstly because people buying form them do not care about quality when they buy, and seconly because a quality customer service is expensive.<<they have refunded all charges to my account>> That is good news, if the dispute was successful."
"I fonly your son had not missed his original flight, I'm sure that nothing else negative would have happened..."
"Reading all of your comments really made me think that I was very lucky with this agency so far.I booked tickets from them not only once but twice. One from Hochiminh City to Amsterdam for 3 persons and another once from Santorini to Amsterdam for 4 persons (3000 Euro for total I would say). And there was no problem at all. I received my tickets all valid after checking code with the airplanes. I accidentally input wrong email address for the 1st trip and soon I wrote email to them, a day later they called back from Greece and few minutes later, I got my order confirmation sending to my correct email.However, I should be more cautious from now on as I really dont want to experience the problems and bad services which you have encountered.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hey guys I just booked the mytrip but seemingly the money has gone to e travel sa athens. So 523 euros has eft my account for a return trip to bangkok, but ive received no confirmation email and after reading this stuff im starting to get worried.

Do you have this uk support number please?
"They left me stranded in Korea, giving me the tough choice of either shelling out an extra €100 or ending up an illegal alien in this country, when confronted with the issue, they simple quoted their terms and conditions and laughed their way to the bank. Don't trust them, they are more than likely fraudulent and had I known I would have never trusted them."
"PaoloIf you go to the mytrip.com website and click on ""information"" under ""Company"" you will see that mytrip.com is a trading name for e-Travel S.A., a Greek company.Your money going to them is not something to worry about.Perhaps by now you have received notice of the flights bought for you. But, if not, and as long as there is still plenty of time before your trip, don't panic. Panicking is a bad thing to do when dealing with online ticket companies, any steps you take while in a panic can finish up costing you a lot of money."
"This company is the worst on earth! Avoid please There is no service if you need anything after booking. They don’t answer on the phone, emails, Facebook, I tried everything.Just terrible, they cost me so much stress and frustration"
"Hiloosh, please don't expect a decent level of service form any third party booking site. This forum is filled with similar complaints about lots of such companies."
"Do NOT use this company!!! Have so bad exsperians ....Not any answer at mail, and not any help at phone . I baught a trip from Bali - Oslo, with a stop in bankok ! Because of vulkania we want to change ouer trip to Thailand insead. And wanted not to use flight from Bali but use same ticet we already payd for , from Bali . That would cost us 10800,- nok .

"Hi,I had a very bad experience with MyTrip.com.MyTrip.Com issue flight tickets (Hyderabad  Riyadh  Jeddah  Geneva) which Saudia airlines later confirmed that the bookings are not valid. MyTrip simply refused to acknowledge their mistake and also never bothered to help me during crisis as the booking became invalid. Is there a way I can register a complaint with the relevant authorities?Thanks"
"Stay Away……I don’t wish the stress this company has put me through on my worst enemy.I booked my families flights through them for our holiday in Krabi, Thailand in July 2017 via the internet. It was all fine until they informed us that the flight we booked and pay for does not exist and now we will have a layover of 20 hours in Doha. I told them it is unacceptable as we have a 9 year old child and we cannot have such a long layover. We then asked them to change that we go from Doha to Bangkok and then on to Krabi. They then charged us an additional fee (equivalent to the cost of an extra ticked – that I paid)Then in August (while checking Qatar’s website) I noticed that the ticked for my child does not exist. After lots of emails and telephone calls that was sorted out in September. Then early October I received an automated e-ticket email for myself and my child. – Went on the Qatar website – enter my wife’s details and I received the following message…. Cannot find booking – It might have been cancelled…. Then it all started over again…. Daily calls and emails with no response…. Our date for departure was 28 December and all they are telling me is that they are investigating. This went on until the 20th of December when I threatened to buy a new ticked (even business class) and I will claim the additional cost from them. Eventually they issued my wife’s ticket on the 22nd of December – the only snag was that the flights between Bangkok and Krabi was now fully booked and she had to take different flights.Not once they offered to cover our additional expenses we had and I really cannot understand that IATA still allows them to do business?"
"Hi,Did you try and register a complaint with any authorities? If so, can you please share the details?Thanks"
"IATA, The International Air Transport Association, from their website, ""is the trade association for the world’s airlines"" so how do you think they could impact on Mytrip?Edited: 2 years ago "
I wouldn't recommend mytrip.com to anyone. Had a lot of trouble with them.
In my opinion this website operates perfectly. Booked two tickets in Vietnam for a domestic flight and everything worked out fine.Edited: 2 years ago 
They have worst customer service so if you book anything with them and things go wrong...you are on your own!!we bought 5 tickets but due to medical situation (Cancer) we are having hard time to get our full refund!awful service!
"Sorry to hear about your news Adam B. This however would really be travel insurance issue and harsh as it sounds, mytrip.com, or any other ticket reseller, are under no obligation to refund you."
"Unless you bought fully refundable tickets, Adam, then I'm sorry but this situation is indeed a matter for travel insurance.If you did buy fully refundable tickes, then I would expect mytrip to make a charge for processing it, and sometimes this could eat up the entire amount. They would not give you any money back until they had received it from the airline themselves.Edited: 2 years ago "
do not buy. on the day of the trip I had to pay for the tickets again. I do not recommend!! I want my money back !!!
"I suggest staying away from them.I booked a flight with them, and in the process started reading reviews.Mid way I opted out after seeing all the bad reviews and did not authorize my payment.They still processed a manual transaction for the flight, my fault still but most merchants would not process the transaction with no authorization.I did not think it had gone through and booked direct with the airline, I now have 2 seats on an international flight under my details in completely different areas on the plane.Dealing with the bank and Singapore airlines to see if there is a workable solution for me. Otherwise I'\m out around $1200', well if I cancel I might get 103 Eur out minus their admin fee which probably leaves me with 50 Euro if I am lucky.As I say, myTrip has not changed my flight or anything, but they did do a manual transaction, which was not authorized by me and apparently this is 'legal' so not much I can do about it.Just my 2c, they do not follow moral business practices. Airline was only about $100 more, well worth it for the piece of mind, I am chalking it down to school fees for me, but hope others will take head of all these reviews before its too late."
4 of us booked flights from Chicago to Bangkok for March 24. Sure hope they are legit? Guess we will finde out
"Avoid them at any costWe bought tickets trough mytrip.com in July 2017 Belgrade-LA, via Dusseldorf for 22.12.-3.01.2018. When we arrived to Dusseldorf we realised that the flight we bought doesn’t exist anymore-because AirBerlin is not operating any more.We have been trying to get our money back from MyTrip.comThey have insistently refused to offer us a compensation for the initial amount we paid.We are following a legal procedure via the EU Consumer Center to get our money back, as their customer service is just trying to hold us back using excuses and delaying responses. They are keeping our money.Avoid them at any cost."
"https:/…amp A link to reviews about this agency. I used it, they are the worst !!!"
"https:/…ampA collection of awful reviews for this shi*** agency : unreachable, liars... I Book a ticket and I wanted to change something but they never answer to the phone, they dont have An email and they assure you that they tried to reach you but it is false ! RUN"
"I Don´t recommend to use mytrip.com to anybody . I bought tickets via mytrip.com agency and after that my flights were new scheduled one day ahead by Flight company. Mytrip.com mailed me and there were false information to call directly to Flight company if new flights are not ok or to pay them 80 € to give me new options. So I called to Flight company And they told me that only my travel agency ( mytrip.com) can make these changes. But there are optional flights for original day. So I need to pay extra fee 80 e to continue… Before my payment I CALLED mytrip.com (calls are picked up in New York) and after long waiting I was told that there is another options for my actual day. So I had to pay 80€ to continue. After paying I got no answers for many days from mytrip.com. So I called them again. Then I got mail for TWO options: one exactly same change that flight company originally made for me (one day ahead) and flight one day after my original day or they could give money back (except this extra 80€). Everything in these mails were readymade text and option boxes … Nothing personal reply and no service. My holiday was booked so I needed to take this first option as nobody answered personally my mails. Then I got tickets that were not containing extra baggage that I had originally paid, and no Answer as contacting the agency for that. So Don’t buy anything from mytrip.com ! Feels like big scam!"
"Fraud company - be aware!!!Mytrip.com is fraud company - stay aware! My experience with them – On the 3rd of February I booked a one-way combined ticked (3 connection flights) from Nassau to Glasgow through Toronto and London. A week later they sent me a flight change offer to accept: My flight from Toronto to London is rebooked to one that is 6 hours later. If I agree to it, I also agree to arrive to London at 11.50AM. However, there were no changes made to my third flight from London to Glasgow - it is still scheduled to take off from London at 10.30AM. Essentially I have to agree to miss my flight! :) What a great opportunity for almost 650 eur! If I choose not to accept - they ask me to pay 27 euros so that they would offer something different :)))) Fraud as is! Phone helpline is on hold forever and no replays to several emails. But I contacted my credit card issuer bank (i'm their business client) and they are currently consulting with EU police structures to do something about these greek scammers - Mytrip.com owners e-Travel S.A. (registered and located in Athens, Greece. 7 Kifisias Ave., Ampelokipoi 115 23, Athens. EU VAT registration number: EL998645900). All similar opinions about similar cases from here and from tripadvisor are collected and sent to the bank to put an end to this sham!"

"Yes its my fault . I just believe to skyscanner where get their offer ( they have 5 stars there) ... Of course if I search here and found opinions...omg.Its true connection in one booking - first two legs are operated by AirCanada, but third by Brittish Airways.Edited: 2 years ago "
Here is a link where I put PDF document what shows their flight change offer https:/…
"I would say he booked the flights in same one trip and Mytrip.com just ""happened"" to make change to one connecting flight in that trip to cause the whole departure or return trip ruined. I got into same issue. I'm working with my bank now to get back my money. Mytrip.com is a scam.And you know what? People don't always check history of a travel agency if the website looks standard, especially with IATA on it. It's a fault of us but again, doing online business needs trust. If a travel agency shows up in the finding list of Skyscanner or momondo, you kinda trust it already..."
"'If a travel agency shows up in the finding list of Skyscanner or momondo, you kinda trust it already...' Why put trust in an advertisement? These ticket selling websites pay Skyscanner and Momondo (both of which are just search sites) quite a lot of money to advertise there, and I doubt Skyscanner cares in the least whether or not mytrip.com (which is by no means a travel agency) is a sound operation as long as they pay their invoices on time."
"""I contacted my credit card issuer bank (i'm their business client) and they are currently consulting with EU police structures to do something about these greek scammers ""Please keep us informed of any action resulting from this."
Yes trip.com is 100% legit.I booked and pre paid in full for 10 nights in a Bangkok serviced apartment and received a big discount through trip.com. They even called me from China to confirm the payment.I do NOT believe the fake reviews targeting trip.com and think they come from the competition.
And what if we do not believe your positive post? Does that mean you work for mytrip?
Good pick-up Luigi. I missed that.
"Never use mytrip.com. I booked in Canadian dollars and when the bill came they flipped it to US dollars. I even took a Picture and have proof but visa does not bother to helpThey never called me back and the same flight is misrepresented today, showing in Canadian and if you book it they will rip you when you get your bill#mytrip.com"
I've also tried phoning and the recorded message provided an email address where I also sent an email only to have it bounce back. I booked a flight for my dad to come back to Australia and he couldn't use the ticket. He had to purchase another ticket which ended up costing more than if we had just purchased it directly from the airline right from the start. After reading these comments I'm starting to suspect that the flight never really existed and the piece of paper I printed is just that with some writing on it.
"Mytrip? No grazie! Antefatto: prenoto per Aruba nel 2017 partenza per 3/2018. Sembrerebbe tutto ok ma nel mese di gennaio 2018 arrivano delle mail dove vengo informato che un volo è stato cambiato. Il cambio non mi permette di prendere il volo successivo in quanto tra ora di atterraggio e successiva partenza ho solo 40minuti. Bene, telefono più volte dove mi viene comunicato che provvederanno ad informare la compagnia aerea... Tutto tace aspetto fiducioso una mail da parte loro, ma mancano pochi giorni alla partenza. Decido pertanto di prenotare un volo alternativo per conto mio con un aggravio di costi non indifferente. Grazie a mytrip.com la mia vacanza è rovinata."
"Well, I must have been lucky! I booked 3 of us to Mfuwe, Zambia and we have been and returned with no hassle whatsoever. Went Emirates from Heathrow, Dubai then Mfuwe with Proflight. Return same. No problems with tickets or anything re Mytrip.com. Reading the other reviews now I would have been seriously worried!"
You'll never want to deal with mytrip.com. It's the worst agent I have ever seen.
Walk on by.
"DONT DO IT! worst company ever, they should be arrested. Charge fees when there arent any , give you the run around, NO managers on DUTY!, no one knows how to fix anything, they read from a script"
How do you arrest an on-line company based in Greece?Edited: 2 years ago 
"They read from a script because that's all they;ve been trained to do. There ar eno managers because that costs money. Like other third party booking sites, this lot are probably scrapin gby oin the fees that they charge. They can't afford to provide good support even if they want to, which they probably don't anyway. That's how this business model works."

Thats the last time I purchase from this company. really bad company, really bad customer service. I do not recommend this company for NBODY. dont waste your time and money with the company.

Do not use these people. If there are any problems at all they will do their best to screw you over. I am currently in a dispute with them. Find another site. Cheap does not always equal good.
Absolutely terrible. Just booked flights last week with them- paid for ‘flexi tickets’ - read extra charge per ticket of $18 which basically allows you to change dates. When I needed to change neither can you reach Mytrip- (customer services routes to a voicemail) nor could you change the tickets with the airline as per them it was a non refundable ticket and the airline did not recognise the flexi-ticket fees. I wish I had looked up reviews on tripadvisor before booking. Absolutely terrible.
"i booked KL- shanghai trip for my family in november last year. There were a few changes abt the timing, but overall good."
DO NOT USE THIS AGENCY EVER... booking itself was ok... but later they inform you about flight changes (that make no sense - e.g. flight change disables you to catch all connecting flights) and you only have 2 options... to accept... or decline with help of assisant and for that you need to pay a fee.... and when you ask them how many changes can you still expect like this... thy sy it can be many.. and every time they would charge you a fee (27€/person) UNACEPTABLE!
"Laura you do understand that it’s the airlines who change schedule not the agency? Mytr don’t appear to be great but they can’t be blamed for what the airline does, nor are they clairvoyant so don’t know if/how many other changes there might be.I don’t blame them for charging you for dealing with these changes for you. It’s extra work for them and wasn’t their fault it happened so why should they work for free.If you’d booked directly, you could have managed this yourself.On a trip I’vee got planned for September, I’d already had 5 schedule changes notified by the airline (all minor)until earlier this week when they cancelled the flight that will get me home. They’ve withdrawn that flight completely. I’d booked directly with them so all I had to do was get on the phone to the. And ask for my rerouting options, choose the one I preferred and hang on the line whilst they rebooked me and issued a new eticket. It took around &0 minutes of my time but no charges for anything."
"A lot of trouble. I fault myself for not having looked at the rating under Skyscanner for mytrip before booking. If for any reason you need to call them for a change, it’s € 40/person and that’s provided someone answers their phone."
"A month ago, the only website that had a hotel in Singapore within my budget was TRIP.COM. None of my usual 3rd party websites came within my budget, NOR HAD AVAILABILITY for the 9nights I needed. Even the hotel's website showed ""ALL ROOMS FULLY BOOKED"". That was because I had left it to the day before arrival to book my hotel. I had no choice but grit my teeth and clicked ""book"". I booked a hotel room for 9nights at $149. I had read the reviews that questioned their legitimacy and the customer service, and DEFINITELY, I was worried but I went ahead with my reservation.1. Yes, they were indeed legit... and the cheapest also.... :)2. Before I could finish my vacation, I had a death in my family and had to return home.3. HERE COMES THE ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"" part that reviewers were posting about --- I called their Customer Service, and emailed them that I couldn't fullfill my stay due to a death in the family. They replied to my email within 10minutes, and confirmed they would contact the hotel directly.4. For the next 3 days, they contacted me by email and by phonecall, even left me a message when I wasn't able to take the call.5. When they said they would look into it... they did. When they said they would call me within 24hours, they did, in less than 24hrs. THEY FULLFILLED ALL THEIR PROMISES MADE TO ME, AT AN AWFUL TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS GRIEVING. I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND KINDNESS FROM A FRIEND, MUCH LESS A STRANGER, BEHIND THE ANONYMITY OF THE INTERNET.6. Furthermore, they refunded me the unused nights of the my hotel stay within ONE WEEK .TRIP.COM IS LEGIT. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE REAL HUMAN BEINGS. THEY WILL HAVE MY BUSINESS AGAIN. THANK YOU, TRIP.COM"
I’m sorry to hear about your loss. Your positive experience was with trip.com which is a different provider vs. mytrip.com which this forum is about.
"Stay away from this fraudulent website.they will take your money and come up with different stories. At the same time, do not believe any of their cancellation policy. They will not return/cancel your tickets should you need to.The flight time and location will change by the date you are ready to fly.if you want a STRESS FREE ticket, STAY AWAY from this this"
"I booked a flight, after a while they sent a flight change which would be impossible for me to take. I had to pay £ 35,00 for the booking cancellation. It is already 35 days that I paid for the cancellation service and I never see my money back. I also expended other £10 by calling their call center."
"Booked flights with Aeroflot via My Trip as £50 cheaper than booking direct. Have to admit that had a slight panic after reading these reviews but all went smoothly. Was able to use the booking code My Trip send to register on the Aeroflot website, book seats, check in and download boarding passes etc.Think I will book direct next time just in case any changes are needed to be made as My Trip ultimately own the booking."

"£50 wouldn't be enough of a saving for me to contemplate gambling with a site like MyTrip, sorry."
"Last year I bought a ticket with mytrip. There was a doubt if the procedure ended well or not. There was no confirmation. I contacted them by e-mail. It took a little time and I send a reminder. Little time later THEY called me and did a lot of effort to solve the problem, witch they did. My trip from AMS to BUE began and ended perfect. Last week, before reading these messages here, I entered an office of American Airlines to check the hours of my returning flight and they confirmed me everything perfect.Some of the people here spoke about only booking with the airlines. My experience with Iberia is so that I lost 55000 miles because they were not capable to use the miles in a purchase of a trip. I sent an e-mail to complain. They confirmed recepcion of my mail. No reaccion on the concept of the e-mail. I went to an office and they couldn't do anything but selling and sent me to e-mail. The e-mail doesn't react. I went to the client desk in Barajas Madrid. They sent me to the email. The email doesn't react. So when will I recuperate these miles? As you see, my experience is different then the mayority of the messages here. The only observation that I have is that part of them are mistakes of planning of either the passenger either changes of the airlines. Also experiences with another site named trip.com. Some problems with mytrip.com seem badly explained and then it is difficult to solve.What is strange is that a lot of messages are so similar en concept, style and vocabulary. Is competition abusing of TripAdvisor to misinform us?"
"Don't book to a third party. I made a booking through mytrip and didn't send me a confirmation. To make it sure I called the airline company after 24 hrs to know if there's a reservation under my name on the travel dates. Indeed there's none. So I assumed that the booking didn't go through at all. To my surprise, my CC was charged. I filed a dispute to my bank but after a week the bank notified me that mytrip denied to refund."
"i have booked 4 tickets from make my trip through & fro from chennai to Cochin & Cochin to chennai and the flight got cancelled by the airlines side now here is the first mistake it got cancelled okk fine now u have cancelled it i need my refund i spoke to the customer care and claimed for a refund to which they promised me a time of 7 working days okk so i waited for 7 working days even after that i haven not got my refund i called them up again they said they will escalate the issue and chck but from their end the amount has been refunded, so if what they are saying there should be some truth in this either they should have done it or they are just bluffing, coz in my bank account statement the amount is not yet come so every alternate day i have called the customer care and got a reply that we are still looking into the issue and our manager is bussy and we will arrange a call back now its been a month and im still trying to talk to them and get my money back but i am not getting proper response from them. i request everyone not to book from make my trip they are fraud its a scam they take our money and gives us RUBBISH excuses they are just sitting to eat our money use some other websites like yatra, clear trip, go ibibo, expedia, travel guru, etc. BUT MY REAL ADVISE DONT USE MAKE MY TRIP AND INFORM ALL YOU FAMILY & FRIENDS IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY GO FOR IT"

This last message is about a site called www.makemytrip.com and has (once again) nothing to do with www.mytrip.com.
This company is a complete fraud. They should be investigated and closed. They do NOT honour any of their obligations on cancellations. DO NOT USE...!
What obligations do they have on what is probably a non-refundable ticket?
"They try to sell you all kinds of questionable stuff during the booking procedure. It appears not to be a complete scam however, because I'm able to go to the airlines website and put in the ""check-in number"" listed on the e-ticket (not to be confused with the booking number) to verify the existence of the booking.Sorry to hear that their customer support is lacking."
It’s a very bad company
It’s a very bad company don’t use mytrip
Don’t use mytrip
Very very bad company don’t use mytrip
"I booked a ticket to New Delhi on their website, before reading your reviews. I had no issue whatsoever. After booking, I got in touch with all the airlines I had to fly with, to make sure they got the reservation and my details and that all was well. I couldn't check in online for some of the flights, but I did it at the airport and it was all good."
"Worst customer service I have experienced. This company ignores all emails and when you call them their only answer is that they are sorry and they will pass the request on. I am fed up of hearing this. I was due a refund when my flight was cancelled at last minute and I have had to beg for my money. Eventually I received an email saying my refund had been processed but 30 days later i still haven’t received anything!!!!! I wonder how many emails and phone calls I will have to make now until I am listened to! Awful awful company, and there is no way of making a complaint to them."
"I'm having the same problem as Atlas Global has a schedule change on part of a flight which means we miss our connection, I have humorously called Mytrip and I keep getting told that they are dealing with it and are awaiting a response back from the airline. However I rang Budget Air whom I booked my father's ticket through were able to send me a conformation of change within 3 hours."
I will never use again. They charged $100 for baggage and then cancelled it. They kept the $100 for over30 days before refunding. Terrible communication. Don't answer emails. Bought the baggage from the airline direct for $50.....
"Hello, is not a true company. Plase, if any of you had had a BIG problem with the, contact me to escribamelindo@hotmail.com. They doesn t follow european laws, they have no contact center...just freelances working around...so if you have any probelm...bsolutly nobody will help you in a professional way. Agaim, if soemoen of you had alerady put a legal demand to them, contact me. Thank you"
"true thing. Again, i m looking for people to join to my legal demand. Escribamelindo@hotmail.com"
"helo: same here. Again, i m looking for people to join to my legal demand. Escribamelindo@hotmail.com"
And what European laws do you maintain they have broken? Abiding by their terms and conditions?
"they are a legitimate company but their customer service is absolutely abysmal, and they charge you extra (on top of the airline's cost) for every change you make. I would strongly advise going direct with the airline."
"We've had similar problems. We were'nt suspicious as the price wasn't overly cheap, we booked flights to Australia, 8 months ago.A month after booking we received three emails in a row telling us of time changes to the middle of the 3 flights.Now, three weeks before we leave, we requested that they re-send our e-tickets (to make sure they hadn't made any more changes) To our horror the etickets said that we're now going to Brisbane instead of Darwin.2000 miles away.at first i thought it was an error by mytrip. so i did a bit of investigating and noticed that there were 2 flights with our flight number one to darwin, one to brisbane. i then noticed to my horror that the airline have stopped doing flights to darwin entirely, since march 2018, no one told us.so now we're currently stuck going to brisbane, everything is paid for in darwin, if we buy more flights to get us from brisbane to darwin, its going to cost us 300 pounds each and cost us an extra 12 hours waiting at brsibane for the flight on top of the 2 days travelling to begin with.i'm not even sure i want to book these brisbane to darwin flights. i have a bad feeling that we'll be crapped on at some point during the journeys, as i've heard bad things about philipine airlines too.i really feel like cancelling the entire holiday"
"After two months of being at war with them for a refund I got my money back ! And my trip rang.. I was being batted back and fourth between them and China airlines, you can cancel if connections and changes to schedules are not suitable. This company does not have a good reputation and I have seen many reviews were people have been stranded and had to pay for connecting flights .. go on trust pilot reviews .... we was going to bankgkok . They are notorious for it and try to charge you £70 just for a call to change your flights. We wasn’t offered an alternative unless we paid extra and we was told by air China we shouldn’t be paying any extra ! If in doubt cancel and get your money back . We cancelled and got emails confirming etc. But it took daily emails and we had the phone put down on us on two occasions when my husband rand .. I’ve heard they are freelance reps."
Today I booked a ticket through mytrip.com and clearly I selected the date of my travel but the ticket issued one week before the date of my exact travel. Mytrip.com is not a reliable website as it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting and expose to hackers. How come my date was changed once it was selected by me the right date for my journey. I will never use this website anymore.
“How come my date was changed once it was selected by me the right date for my journey”—-Maybe there were no flights or availability on the dates you selected?
A small advise to all the travel booking folks. Never book any ticket to third party website. Book directly to the airlines so that any wrong also can be solved through their website. Third party website can play their trick. First of all how vulnerable their website one may not know. Being an IT professional I know lots of websites originating from UK has lot of cross-site scripting and also vulnerable to hacking. How one can be sure their credit card details will be stolen. Top of it while you using your credit card would they take or charge the money equivalent to US Dollar or Canadian dollar amount. That one needs to be very careful. Today I was saved because my credit card Discover was smart enough not to approve the amount. The original amount was in Indian rupee but my card declined to pay the amount due to the third party mytrip.com website does not do any conversion. It means their website gateway payment not properly programmed or built.
We have purchased a ticket through mytrip.com for my mother-in-law to visit us. Upon arrival at the airport she was checked in and told a seat was available for her. Some time later once she had gone through security she was informed that she would not able to fly as she is unable to bend her leg. She was removed from the airport in a state of total humiliation.I contacted mytrip.com who promised to investigate and never came up results. I pushed and pushed again and eventually they refused to take any responsibility for this discrimination against a person with a disability. The only response was essentially you are on your own - please complain to the airline directly (who by the way are operated out of another country).I would never ever use this agency again as they have provided absolutely no help on the contrary they have made the distress of this situation even worse.Right now we are both at an emotional and financial loss.0/0 never use this company
"Tim, unless I;m missing something, MyTrip were not involved at all in the decision that your mother in law was not fit to fly. So I;m not surprised that they ar enot taking responsibility.Now, I'd never use them myself, and of course it's not good if they have said they will do something and then they don't, but I wouldn't count on any booking site to help me deal with something that wa soutside their control.I believe that they are quite right in informing you to take the matter up with the airline. After all, it was the airline that made the decision."
"Avoid them like plague.. only way you can contact them is thru a uk premium number and it is just a front office, you have no way of talking to the agents doing the bookings. I lost around £50 making phone calls but issue stands unresolved."
"I have had the worst experience with Mytrip.com.I purchased a ticket, happy with the option that they can update the ticket if needed, and will charge me only the fair difference price. YET IT IS ONLY A SENTENCE TO ATTRACT THE PREY.I have- made 6 online requests, through the website, and through the app.- made at least 10 international calls (average call 10 min)- sent an email complaint- filled an online complaint.Yet here I am, My flight request change is for the day after tomorrow.Prices are going up by the minute.I have not received a confirmation yet.They would not allow me to do the update over the phonethey would not allow me to speak to a supervisorThey ask me to WAIT FOR THE EMAIL- the email is a trick that is sent whenever you are not ready- no further notice, or timeframe of when to expect it. they give you a 48 hour window ... hahahaha seriously??- it has a period of 20 min validty. then it is EXPIRED. and you need to apply again. (DO NOT GO TO THE TOILET, DO NOT DOSE OFF, DO NOT TAKE A CONFERENCE CALL ... DO NOT .. .DO NOT ) JUST KEEP STARING AT YOUR PHONE... OR- the application tells you to apply again ... repeat the top 10 steps... im still waiting for my update ... but will probably end up buying a complete new ticket right now ... unfortunately, THEY HAVE SUCCEEDEDbut the least i can do ... is worn others not to fall for this scam.CheersAzmi"
Plenty of people have tried to warn others but it didn't help you!
"I complained Daily by phone calls and emails , they remove comments off their Facebook page too . I made my self nuisance to be heard and and after 8 weeks of it they refunded us . I threatened them with legal action and said I had reported them to the Greek trading standards, I found Greek trading standards on the internet and contacted them , the day after I received a call from my trip in fact they rang me 5 times in one day to tell me they would sort this ASAP . Yet other people had been rude we had phones put down on us ,told we had to buy new flights if we didn’t accept flight change that was totally pointless.. had same thing , I’ve travelled long haul for years , been a first for me this has . It’s made me check websites in future , saying it was a trip advisor ad too .. so ....,, we think it’s legit, lesson learnt"
"Azmi,It seems you went into this arrangement knowing that you might need to make a change to you travel plans. Why would you ever book with a third party- legit or otherwise- instead of buying a flexible ticket with an airline. Knowing full well that the only way these companies make their money is through fees and that they have appalling customer service, the only why one should ever use on- with proverbial gun pointed at his or her head- is if there is 100% certainly that no changes will need to be made. The folly here seems to be yours."
"In my case absolutely it wasn’t a need to change to possibly change travel plans, we booked a return ticket to Bangkok that’s it .. airline changed the times , times was unsuitable , we’d of have a 21 hour stop off wait , not suitable , air China said my trip have to offer an alternative, my trip didn’t offer an alternative and said we had a buy another connecting flight on top of what we already paid . Air China actually supported us with our case in all fairness and my trip just tried to extract more money,it’s fair to say that are a lot of people who book via third party .. not all are like this , people make mistakes so your opinion in relation my circumstance isn’t quite correct ,thankyouEdited: 2 years ago "
My response isn’t in relation to yours by the way ☺️
"On 20 July 2018 I saw a Saudia Airlines flight for 22 July for $154 on cheapflights.com which forwarded me to mytrip.com for booking. Visa debit card got charged but I got an email from Saudia showing ""TICKET TIME LIMIT"" of 18 July. On 21 July, I couldn't find my booking on Saudia's website. Since Saudia's local office closed at 2 pm on Saturday, I went to their airport office from there. They confirmed that booking had been cancelled due to ""TICKET TIME LIMIT"" while that same 22 July flight still shows up both on cheapflights.com and Saudia website on 22 July with a price tag of $166. Mytrip website shows ""Your flight reservation can't be found"", so I can't proceed online. Although doing business online, mytrip provides no email address. They only show a street address and a phone number in Athens, Greece as if they are a local business. Saudia says, I bought ticket from mytrip so they can't issue a refund, and mytrip can't be reached."
"i have ticket with them including baggage and i printed it but in the airport the said is not including baggage i have to pay for 5 baggage, it is not a good mytrip now more than one year no refund"
Very bad service. I wanted to change a ticket and mytrip promised me to call and help. They never called or emailed to respond to my queries. I called them thrice and every time they said they are working and will report to me within 24 hours but that never happen. The whole drama went on for one week. At the end they said that they can not do anything and I have to cancel my ticket. Meanwhile my flight tickets surged like crazy. I will never ever book from this website.
"In reply to your question, Please check the extract from a mail I sent to them after loosing $418 dollars and I don't how much in international calls .to: ""Mytrip.com Flights"" <flights@mytrip.com>,info@airtickets24.comMs M******, and/or anyone receiving this e-mail, Regarding my reservation # UE****,First, it is very clear I booked this extremely overpriced ticket so I can have the ability to change it !Second ,I have called your customer support 2 weeks ago and they confirmed that that my ticket is full flex . Then on July 29th I made a request to change it into and open date ticket .. . After 9 full days on a Friday evening and only 2 hours before crossing the 48 limit ! I received the email above, telling me ""it is not permitted to convert your ticket into open"". So I called your customer support as soon I received the email and that was more 24hrs before the flight time and less than 24 hours after your email so practically ""within the day"" and requested to cancel the flight and loose 35 dollars in fees as agreed. Your agent at the time confirmed receiving the application - she didn't advise to change the date and not cancel and didn't even mention it is still plausible - then she confirmed submittingthe cancellation request. At 11:27 PM Local time I received an email telling me I can only get back 23 dollars because it is less than 48hrs before flight time! I refused to agree and applied again for cancellation online, and Until now no response..How could a professional travel agency intentionally delay an email reply to a change request for 9 full days ! Just enough to be received less than 48 hours before the flight then hold the customer responsible ?! This doesn't sound like a professional travel agency work, it sounds more like planned robbery !"
">.This doesn't sound like a professional travel agency work, it sounds more like planned robbery !<<And yet, you still chose to use them without checking them out first. A fool and his money are soon parted."
Absolutely the worst company ever I’ve never had issues with booking things online but this company is actually horrific I needed to adjust my return flights as I work on board a cruise ship and needed to return earlier than expected - I emailed for two weeks and I received no response I would just pay extra and go with someone els as this has been a headache
"DAD-HPH Aug 15,2018: 1st time and also last time to use mytrip.com service. I booked a night flt, which was rapidly confirmed. Later, mytrip.com charged my credit card and sent me an e-ticket of a daytime flt. Why I had to pay more to get a night time flt then they issued a day time flt ticket to me without any notice? They cheated me badly. I tried to send them email, called to them also but no respond. I not only paid expensively but also got massive stress."
"Never book through mytrip.com! It’s been six days since my flight was cancelled, which should have left three days from now. Mytrip.com has been ‘handling the case’ since thursday but so far they don’t seem to be very good in their job to book flights since I still don’t have one."
"This company have the worst after sales support i have ever seens.if you have any problem during weekend nobody is there to support.They can truncate your name on the e-ticket and then no way to adjust it.If ever you are able to reach their support, you cannot ask them to send you an email to confirm your request. all you hear: you have to wait,"
"Dealing with this company has been a complete nightmare. We booked $4,000.00 worth of flights with this company in December and the flight was cancelled. We ended up being stranded half-way through our flight and MyTrips finally responded the following day!! They left us completely stranded and we had to find our own way home. We had cancellation insurance so we expected to receive a refund but ended up having to fight this company for the last 8 months for our money back. Over 5 months ago, they emailed us to notify that we did actually qualify for the refund. We have yet to see this credit and they no longer even respond to my emails. They say that they are waiting for an answer from the airline but I would not even be surprised if they never even talked to the airline. Absolutely deplorable the way these people conduct business. I have never felt so powerless as a consumer."
Take care.. That is a scam...
"This company needs to be sued!! I am already in the process to take legal actions against this fake agency!I`ve booked my parents a return ticket from NZ to Sydney, Australia costing $750 AU dollars. The booking process was okay, however by only committing a simple mistake (naming my mum under her nickname) I was left neglected by the company until the day of their departure. I`ve made more than 200 calls to the UK so that I could get their assistance on correcting my mum's name so that she can fly over to Australia and return back to NZ without any issues. Not only they didn't help me but also they lied about progressing with my name correction request. I waited 7 days to get some answers, though every time I called they gave me different answers and only to find out that no action has been taken ever since. After only having one day left until my parents' departure and having no clear answers from MYTRIP.COM, I called Latam airline directly to have my mum`s name changed otherwise she would have missed her flight and still after 2weeks I haven't received any response from MYTRIP.COM Long story short, please avoid this website, they are crooks, they did not change my mum's name, therefore, I had to cancel the ticket and buy her a new one! Even when I requested the ticket to get cancelled they did not cancel it, hence there was no refund !! I literally lost $ 500 dollars for their neglectable behaviour!! they are either fake or have no ethical standards!! shame on you."
"DONT USE THIS COMPANY!They dont give any good customersupport! I have used many weeks to try to change my outbound flight. But I ended up buying new tickets insted.Have called them A LOT of times. About 50% of the calls, they hung up after 3-4 minutes..."
"Do not use mytrip.comThe worst company everI paid for upgraded customer service, they never replied to my requests for ticket change. When I called in a panic because now my flight was leaving in 2 days (via mobile back to UK) they refused to help. When they finally did help they wanted to charge me an EXTRA £3000.00 for my return flight from NZ (even though I had paid for flexible tickets!) I gave up getting help from them. When I spoke to the airline direct they found me a ticket for £750.00 I have learnt my lesson. Don’t make the same mistake as me. Book elsewhere!"
"MyTrip.com Double charged my Card and NOT responding to any of my complaints!I should have read the reviews of MyTrip.com in here before I decided to buy tickets for my upcoming trip. I have so many regrets having bought them from MyTrip.comMyTrip.com had my card charged twice for almost in total of USD 3180 for my flight to NYC !!, Tried to contact them (in desperate attempts) through calls, emails, facebook and even twitter!. The CS guy told me to send email with my booking code, I did that but only to be ghosted by them for almost 5 days by now!. The admins from Facebook and Twitter gave me little bright hope but only to that, hope of saying their support team will contact me from email, which up until now 5 days: NONE!.It is so true that so many people in here complained about (probably) non-existence of so-called Customer Service/Support from MyTrip.Com.I would strongly suggest you NOT to book anything through MyTrip.com !"
"Ich habe ein Asien-Ticket gebucht und sofort mit Visa Karte bezahlt. Es kam aber keine Email mit Ticket an, auch nach 2 Tagen noch nicht und der Flug soll in 2 Tagen sein. Die Ticket-Kosten waren sofort von meinem Konto abgebucht...Auch nach vielen Stunden suchen keine Email Adresse gefunden. Dann eine Telefonnummer in Griechenland gefunden. Leider nur Musik auf dieser Telefonnummer, oder nur ein Peep..... und das Stundenlang....... Es reicht.. nie mehr benutze ich mytrip.comin EnglishI booked a ticket to Asia and paid immediately with my Visa card. But no email with ticket arrived, not even after 2 days and the flight should be in 2 days. The ticket costs were immediately debited from my account...Also after many hours search no email address found. Then found a phone number in Greece. Unfortunately only music on this phone number, or just a peep........ and that for hours....... Enough... never again will I use mytrip.comEdited: 1 year ago "
"Mytrip isn't legit, it's pure fraud, we had the worst experience with them ever. DO NOT BOOK!After several attempts trying to receive some customer service from them, I'd like to put through a formal claim, does anyone know how to go around this? They stole our money (long-haul flights) and continuously change their answers on the matter. Nightmare!"
DO NOT USE mytrip.com they use a variety of scam tactics
"We booked a flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok via Muscat on Oman Air using Mytrip.com. It was booked in the first week of September for a flight on November 26th. On September 13 Mytrip.com informed us by email that our Oman Air flight from Abu Dhabi to Muscat had been cancelled and we were now booked on an flight departing several hours later and arriving in Muscat after our connecting flight would have departed. When we contacted Mytrip.com that we would miss our connecting flight to Bangkok, we were told that they would only assist in resolving this issue if we we paid an ""administration fee"".The Mytrip.com agent advised that they were only a travel agency. We replied that we agreed that they were a travel agency representing the airline and since the airline cancelled our flight, it was only natural that they assist us in resolving this problem.When the Mytrip.com agent was asked why we had to pay an ""administration fee"" we were told it was company policy.Please be aware of this company. As far as we are concerned they provided absolutely no customer service whatsoever. Larger internet airline  sales websites may initially charge slightly more but they also provide excellent customer service support when you experience a problem."
"DO NOT USE Mytrip.com. The contact numbers they post on their website are dead. You cannot contact them for customer support. They do not allow you to add baggage to your flight and don't reply to e-mail requests to do so. I contacted the airlines running the flights through and after quite a bit of time they were finally able to locate my flight details and informed me that mytrip.com input my first name and my surname in reverse, consequently there would be no guarantee that I would be allowed on the flights and that any checked baggage would have to be paid for at the airport with no guarantee that it was possible to check them right through to the end of the 3 flight trip with no guarantee of how much it could possibly cost."
"huggabeth,""The Mytrip.com agent advised that they were only a travel agency. We replied that we agreed that they were a travel agency representing the airline and since the airline cancelled our flight, it was only natural that they assist us in resolving this problem.""You have no idea. They are NOT travel agents - they are third party ticket floggers. They are NOT representing the airline - they are pretending to be you to buy a ticket from the airline, as you requested them to do, exactly the same as you could have done yourself direct with the airline.."
"Huggabeth, completely agree with Frommy and would add that expecting to do additional work for you without payment is unrealistic. These online booking platforms make very little on selling you a cheap ticket. They rely on automation to keep costs down. As soon as their staff have to get involved to manually resolve. HNges caused by either the airline or the passenger, they want to. E Aid to do that.Next time book direct or pick a real travel Agency if you want that kind of service."
Thank you for the heads up!
"Don't use,, it will be hidden cost and if you have problems like i did, they don't answer on the site, don't answer on email, it did not help to call as the one answer spoke so bad English i could not understand, over two months to cancel a trip? Do not useKristian from Sweden"
">> over two months to cancel a trip <<given that the majority of flights they sell are non-refundable there is likely nothing to be refunded when the cancellation is done, often it is worth not cancelling and keeping the booking in the slim chance there is a schedule change that allows you to cancel for refund"

Oh no - this is happening to me now :( Bangkok to Tbilisi and the conection in Bahrain is departing before I arrive.....Currently on hold with Gulf Air. Wish I had checked the agent properly before I booked - wish me luck.......
Yes i think mytrip.com is fraud they dont give a booking number to my husband so my husband cannot find the booking even its successfull and we done pay really hassle and stressfull because its rush and nothing happen they dont answer the call and cost so much money to call them also to clarify and ask about the booking reference number because they dont send email to my husband!!!!
Never use this company. Customer service is the worst! If you need to change you will not be able to
"Not trustable. Make yourself a favour and never spend a dime with them...Bought a flight trip to Croatia this summer for 7. As informed on the website, there was the possibility to spend an extra 97,86€ to choose the plane seats. As we were travelling with kids we thought this would be a good idea.On the flight days (both ways), at the gate we were not offered the seats we bought, despite we've complaint about it.Afterwards, we've contacted mytrip.com explaining this, and they said that we should just send an email, with the boarding passes in attach - which we promptly did.Today, more than a month has passed, and after three emails sent we haven't got any reply or action at all...One cannot avoid to feel that we are completely exposed when purchasing online from a company with no ethics at all... HORRIBLE experience delivering the service they are selling (at a surcharge)HORRIBLE managing after sales and refunds (none so far)"
">>One cannot avoid to feel that we are completely exposed when purchasing online from a company with no ethics at all.<<You certainly are, particularly if you're too lazy to research the company first. Which would have told you not to book with them. Any reason you didn't book with the airline?"
Actually this is happening to me right now. Did you speak to anyone from the company. This is bizarre MUTRIP.COM SHOULDN'T be in in business.
Can I please get their e-mail please. I trying to contact.
They or me ( can’t see who made the mistake) maid a mistake one letter in a minors name gave a months notice to have it fixed the did not give a reply till the last minute offering a refund of 75% the money I paid refused to fix it and are holding my money for thirty days as well as a last minute booking to get to my wedding so flights have cost me thousands more then the thousands it cost in the first place I would not use them ever again Even paid extra for a person to help me sort this
I'm currently having the same issue... did you resolve??
"Booking ref PBD2J4Booked two flights to Australia way back in April. As most of you know Carolyn was diagnosed with cancer in July and is unable to fly due to her ongoing treatment. I therefore submitted a flight cancellation form to mytrip who we booked the flights with. I immediately got a reply email acknowledging receipt of the request to cancel and they informed me that a representative would contact me to discuss the matter. After 3 weeks of hearing nothing,I rang them for an update. I was told that it would cost £470 to cancel the flights. I explained the reason for the cancellation. I then received another email telling me to get a letter from the hospital and confirmation that I was married to Carolyn so that they could contact Cathay Pacific for a full refund. On 10th September I emailed all the docs as requested. On 1st of October I rang for an update. I was informed that they still needed to contact Cathay Pacific and someone would contact me. Rang this morning,was told again that they still hadn't heard from Cathay Pacific. Have now just received an email from them saying that they will refund me the price of the flights less £470 cancellation fee. As having a medical condition is not a reason to issue a full refund. Mytrip have been unhelpful throughout this process. Apart from two emails sent immediately after I forwarded a cancellation request I have only had one other piece of correspondence explaining what was required from me for a full refund.I received an email yesterday afternoon. I opened it when I got in from work. Giving me the option of accepting the refund less the £470,or declining it. It stated that I had 12 hours to reply. As I only opened the email after 4pm. I felt that I had no choice but to accept the refund as your office's were closed and did not open until 6am. Therefore I wasn't given the opportunity to discuss the cancellation fees with a representative from your company.This has been a very distressing time for my family and Mytrip have added to the anxiety with their unhelpful and uncaring attitude.Steve Clitheroe."
>> As having a medical condition is not a reason to issue a full refund <<that is pretty standard. Have you spoken to your travel insurance?
"Yes, Steve, this exactly the sort of situation that travel insurance is designed to cover. Anything that you cna get from airlines and booking sites should be regarded as a bonus, I'm afraid.Expecting help and care form a company like this one is also unrealstic in my view. Their staff will be trained to the bare minimum required, poorly paid and not given any discretion to deviate form the instructions on the screens in front of them. So i's not really surprising if they don't appear to care!In future I hope you will just book with the airlines. At least you'll cut out one layer of frustration. Best wishes for your future travels."

On my recent trip I used Mytrio to make some bookings.They charged me twice for transactions that were unsuccessful. To cap it on my last day of the trip another charge appeared on my account which DID not make.They are not legit and fraud in my view.

"I found the cheapest ticket on My Trip (through Skyscanner) for Oslo to Kochi. It was 1600 NOK (around 200 USD) cheaper than other competitor websites. I was tempted to book it, but thought of checking review sites and find that negative experiences outnumber good reviews here and on TrustPilot. I am pretty sure the prices are intentionally kept not live to mislead people to their site.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I don't know why Skyscanner have given mytrip.com access to sell tickets through their portal. In a way, they are helping fraud company to cheat customers."
“I don't know why Skyscanner have given mytrip.com access to sell tickets“—-Because MyTrip pay Skyscanner to show their results. All it takes is a little research before hand before spending your money.
">> Better use other agents, which allow you to change tickets immediately. <<To be able to do that you should cut out the middleman altogether and book directly with the airline"
"Nope!Nope!Nope!Ripoff. I booked a hotel stay from Oct 11- Oct 14 2018 via Trip.com.Showed up at the hotel and checked-in without a problem.Upon check-out, the hotel charged me directly.Trip.com says that the hotel charge was a security charge and that it would be refunded within 10 business days.The hotel says that they never received payment from Trip.com and as such were not issuing a refund.Trip.com again said yes they spoke to the manager, that all was sorted out and the funds would be in my account. Even followed up with an e-mail stating as such.Here I am 10 days later and back on the phone again.Tired with having to go back and forth, I insisted that Trip.com conference the hotel into the call. At which point the hotel manager said point blank that they had not received any payment from Trip.comTrip.com is now saying they need to confirm with their 3rd party vendor to confirm that no payment was sent before I can get a refund.I have contacted my credit card company, explained the situation to them and filed a dispute for the charge.I am also writing this review in hopes of saving other travelers from facing the same issue.According to the hotel manager, my situation is not the first that they have had with Trip.com, and they even have a case that is still open from June 2018.Disaster. Stay away from trip.com"
This is the Air Travel forum!
I used them recently please don't book through them. I have put my review on Trust Pilot as well.
DON'T BUY FROM THEMthey changed my flight to impossible date and I they don't fix it. There is not means of contact. If anybody wants to complain and wants to sue them I will join. We should do something otherwise these companies spread like a plague.
heyI think this is is the worst customer experience website ever. they try to charge you more and never refund the amount. They charged me extra and cannot refund the amount.Thanks
"Hi Akash W,What have you done to get a refund?"
"I also had a bad experience with mytrip. I bought a ticket and at the time to check-in at the air company balcony, they said that they could see my reserrtvation, but for some reason it was changed or void. I took the pictures from the screen. They have said to contact the agency that sold me the ticket, to ask what happen, since they did not have control of it. I tried to call all numbers I could find, but their offices were closed. This is not acceptable, since customers fly 24h a day. It's unbelievable that they are closed on Sundays and bank holidays and close at 16h during work days. This shows that they do not care about their customers. Since the air company, Royal Air Maroc didn't allow me to board with that reservation, I had to buy another outbound ticket.Later on, I sent and email with the screen pictures, explaing my problem and called them. In resume, they have never replayed to me and everytime I called Mytrip, they said that I should contact the Air company butI asked them to do that, since it is their responsability, as I am their customer. They have never replayed to me and never contacted RAM.So, I had to buy another outbound ticket and I still do not have a return TICKET. They don't care about their customers. Only sell and probably resell the same ticket to others.Unfortunately I didn't make a search on reviews about Mytrip, before using them. Lesson learnt.NEVER BUY FROM MYTRIP, BECAUSE THE CHEAPEST CAN GET VERY EXPENSIVE. IT'S A SCAM!!!!"
"By far the worst service I got, they charge for every peep, and lots of technical errors. Still waiting for the supervisor to call back 4 days later!"
AVOID MY TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THEY ARE THE MOST AWFUL COMPANY I HAVE EVER USED. They are completely incapable of performing the simplest transaction and I ended up with no flight and now no refund or compensation!If you want more details email avoidmytrip@gmail.com
"No need to shout at us.If they charged you but didn’t arrange your flight, do a chargeback through your credit card provider"
"Hello,Three days after I ordered tickets to India, I asked to cancel the reservation.I do not get an answer / cancel order / refund my money.I try to call them on the phone and there is no answer.Is there a phone number added to MYTRIP?They do not answer the number posted on their site.I would appreciate your help."
">> I asked to cancel the reservation. <<what are the fare rules of the ticket? whilst you should be able to cancel the booking, if non-refundable (many tickets are) then you would not get any money back - would you still want to cancel?"
"I think it's quite likely that you would only get government taxes back if you cancel. The trouble is that with any booking site, they might just cancel your reservation and not pay anything back to you, because their own admin fees will cancel out anything that you'd be due."
Is mytrip.com legit ?Very disappointed with the kind of reply and services we are getting from my trip. Had booked ticket for ams-mum frm mytrip.com website for travel date 28 october 2018. Had put in all my details and made the payment through credit card. To my utter shock i got ticket for 28 november 2018 (not 28 october 2018). Tried to reschedule the flight on the same day. Since 28 october was a sunday mytrip.com office was closed. So i was unable to get hold of them and reschedule my flight. Since i had to travel to mumbai on same day i booked a new ticket. Next day 29 october i contacted mytrip.com and told them the whole episode. At first they said they will refund just 196 euro. Whereas my total ticket cost was 377 euros.After telling them this is a genuine error they told that they will refund 315.17 euros if i responded within 3 hours. Since the respond button on their mail was not working i replied to the same mail conforming that i accept refund of euro 315.17. Thinking that everything is in order i was chasing mytrip.com only for refund. To my utter shock once i got to know that mytrip.com had not cancelled my flight ticket. After calling them everyday and chasing for my refund. Today i got a mail from mytrip.com saying that they will refund just euro10 (not 315.17).I am really very surprised by this kind of attitude towards customers. I promse not to book ticket through this website anytime in future. My whole experience of booking ticket with mytrip.com has been a total disaster. Plus the response from them is really very lethargic.

Bad luck you made a mistake in using trip.com. and then compound this by posting on a thread about mytrip.com.
Has anybody any information on mytrip.com?I am not sure if they even exist.They will not answer emails and give unacceptable answers when you contact them by telephone.
"They are THE WORST TRAVEL COMPANY!!! I don't know how to get out of a booking I made through them! They charge for everything in advance and they never call you. When you email, no replies."
"we just booked them, and its our worst nightmare. the airline changed the flights and unfortunately we have to call mytrip to make the changes for us even if its easier to get in touch with the airline than we could reach them. and until now nothing has happened. they charge you sooooooo fast for admin fee yet, there is NOOOOO service! POOR service"
"Any time you book through an agent (online or a physical person), the agent owns the booking. Any changes must be handled by the agent, not the airline.That's why direct bookings with airlines are often advocated. I only use a knowledgeable, living physical travel agent for more complex itineraries and waitlisting.>>>we just booked them, and its our worst nightmare. the airline changed the flights and unfortunately we have to call mytrip to make the changes for us even if its easier to get in touch with the airline than we could reach them. and until now nothing has happened."
They stole money from me. Said flights were canceled yet never issues a refund to cover this. I believe everyone should avoid this company as i believe they are scammers/not legit.
"Hi, I am having the same problem. Do you have the contact for their legal department please?"
"Do not use them. It's a scam. Terrible service. I booked a flight 4 month's in advance with mytrip.com and Philippine airlines. I used mytrip.com as they were the cheapest. Then got an email within a day of booking to say that the airline had made a scheduled change and moved the first leg of the trip to the exact same time as the second leg of my trip. The airline said it's free to reissue me a ticket, but they mytrip.com charged me £40. I had to pay it as the only free option they gave me, made it impossible to make my trip. I paid, picked my dates and it took over 6 weeks for them to confirm my changes. In that time I lost deposits on hotels as I couldn't confirm my arrival dates etc. I called them twice a week and even called the airline multiple times to check the dates were still free. The airline said it would have taken 2 mins and 1 email to change my dates. Mytrip.com kept telling me it was a long process. They had to refer my case to the booking department, until finally I spoke to one person who was willing to help and he rebooked my tickets in mins while I was on the phone."
"BEWARE! This is my experience...Before I completed my flight reservations I called your customer service to specifically inquire about your seat preference service in which you charge an extra fee. I specifically asked if I paid for this extra service, would I be able to select my seat and the customer rep said yes, I would be able to select my seat preference. After finalizing and paying for my trip, I tried to select my seat (as per your customer I would be able to do this after I pay for the flight) but I couldn't do it. I called your customer service again and they said I had to call the airlines (JAL) to do it. I called JAL and the JAL rep said that I won't be able to to it till 24 hours before my flight. So, I tried it again today 11/26 for my 11/27 flight and still couldn't do it online. I called JAL and they said I can't select a seat preference because of my booking code. I called your customer support and asked them what I can do to get my seat preference (which is an aisle seat) or if I can get a refund for an extra service that I can't seem to use. They said that it's up to the airlines and that I can't get a refund for the seat preference service. I feel that I was conned since you would've known before hand that the booking code does not allow seat preference. You can not and should not offer and charge for this extra service if you can't fulfill this. Your customer service rep stated what was in your fine print about this service not being refundable and not guaranteed but the FACT that I called before completing my booking for this specific extra charge service shows that I made sure that I would be allowed to choose my seat preference if I paid for this extra service. Never once was I told on that phone call that it is not guaranteed nor non refundable.This is NOT good customer service at all and I'm very disappointed. I will post my negative reviews on Skyscanner, google, yelp and all the other review sites I'm a member of so consumers don't get gypped. I will also report this to the Better Business Bureau."
DiFreeAre you aware that you are not corresponding with mytrip.com?It doesn't sound like it from the way you phrase your post.
"I used them and it was perfect, got the tickets the next day and had no issues, cheap price, maybe I was lucky"
I have purchased a ticket on 24/11 and subsequently found out it was a wrong date. Tried emailing and contacting the company but till today 28/11 there is still no reply. Really need to travel on the new date as I have bought my several performance tickets on those dates but till now there is no answer from mytrip.com while the air ticket price is escalating. Good thing the ticket is found in the airline system when I called up the airline so it is not a scam. Conclusion if you are very sure you are travelling on those date and required no assistant whatever please go ahead to use the service. Otherwise stay away.
I don't recommend to any of my friends or family. Prices are not live.
"Good Afternoon All,I would not use mytrip. I have been dealing with them for the past two days to cancel a flight I had booked. Everything was within 24 hours, yet they stand to say that because it is not within their working hours, it doesn't count. 24 hours (time itself) is a constant entity ... so I don't understand their rules and logic. The company says they will follow airline guidelines, but our original airline (WEST JET - who are absolutely amazing) already said multiple times they have no problem refunding the full amount (as we want to get refundable tickets through them instead). They tried contacting the company MyTrip and filling out details on our reservation and MyTrip says the information is not there.If you have a choice, do not book with My Trip. It is unfortunate that their staff are rude, defensive, and scripted, too aside from unhelpful. They could have easily called West Jet themselves and resolved the issue, instead we had to do the run around and get written confirmation. No problem. We will see what happens tomorrow during their working hours.Unfortunately now, a surprise for a parent (who we were hoping would face fears and get on a plane) has become a nightmare.Fortunately, West Jet is working with us and is willing to make a claim against them."

"My daughter bought a return ticket to Goa India from London UK. She wants to add her baby son to her ticket to travel to Uk but it is IMPOSSIBLE to contact them. The reason I think they make it difficult is that when she arrives at airport in india they will charge her an extortionate amount (and he is too small to have a seat)for him to SIT ON HER LAP. I am going to get legal advise. They are appearing to do everything by advising you to contact them, when in fact you cannot."
"I wouldn't buy it.Bought a ticket From Recife to Dublin and one of the tickets was canceled and they don't answer me AT ALL, Latam asked to request for refund to Mytrip, Iberia said the same.Now I have to buy another ticket."
"I had a busy day, 5 flights almost in a row (TLL - FRA - MUC - GVA - FRA - TLL) in one day. I bought tickets with mytrip for a good price. Then I found this thread and was really scared. But everything was fine. Mytrip even sent me SMSs with time/gate/delays details each time before the departure (this is a payed service). I'm totally satisfied. The only thing I can complain is food. Mytrip offered me a special meal for 3 euro, I payed for it, but I didn't get it, because each flight took approximately 2 hours, so no one on the board had hot meal, only snacks and beverages. Anyway I can say I'm completely satisfied with mytrip service."
thats not true they did not refund my 403 bpi think they are scamref:KIYJYJ
it happend to me as wellhave not got my money back yetref:KIYJYJ
"Had/having such a terrible experience overall.Ok, let me explain in a simple way: mytrip.com is all good if u r looking for a good travel deal and assuming everything is going to be alright until u get on board.BUTIf any unexpected things happen like a situation where u can't travel, then things will be extremely terrible with mytrip.One week before my flight, I met up with an accident. The first thing I did was to email them to help me either to cancel or change the dates. Each request u place will take at least two days to get any response and the response will be absolutely useless. It's been a week so far since this ping pong game is going on. My flight I'd tomorrow and until today, my flight tickets Are not cancelled. I am expect a 3k USD loss due to this terrible service from mytrip. I even tried to call them to their expensive UK number but always I was on hold for 15-20 minutes. I had to disconnect as the call from Singapore was rediculously expensive.So guys, a small advice: avoid them! A few bucks great flight deal is worthless as their customer service is extremely rediculous"
Did you have travel insurance Danesh?
"Unless the ticket you purchased was refundable, you would be best to deal with your travel insurance. The airline fare rules will advise what is refundable (likely some taxes) and the rest should be picked up by insurance- assuming the condition is covered. If you chose to self-Insure and not purchase insurance then you only get back taxes minus service fees"
"Danesh, I’m not saying mytrip are good but unless you’d bought expensive flexible and refundable tickets, the best agent can’t get you a refund or change dates unless the fare conditions permit it. So perhaps they aren’t helping you because the fare conditions don’t allow them to.Accidents that prevent you travelling are the sort of thing travel insurance is for, so make a claim with your insurer. If you chose not to insure your trip, you in effect self insured. That means you bear the loss."
"Expecting a third party seller and an airline to protect you form the consequences of illnesses and accidents is a path that is likely to lead to frustration and financial loss more often than not, Danesh."
Don't ever use this totally irriliable platform. We've had lots of serious problems caused by these amateurs.
"Careful, this company does not exist in the US.They are violating the rule that if you cancel a ticket within 24 hours and the flights is over a week from booking you are allegeable for full refund.I am still in a process of disputing with the credit card company (about 8 loops)"
"'They are violating the rule that if you cancel a ticket within 24 hours and the flights is over a week from booking you are allegeable for full refund.' Nope.The ability to cancel and obtain a refund within 24 hours of purchase applies to flights bought directly from the airline. You've added a (pretty bad) third party to the process and by doing so your agent has purchased the flight and as such the rule no longer applies. If you're eligible for a refund of any taxes and fees then mytrip.com will charge a fee to process that refund, which may leave you with very little."
"Camper, as TP says the rule you refer to does not apply o booking sites, only to airlines. It's a common mistake to think it does apply to everyone, but a mistake nonetheless."
"My son bought a ticket through mytrip.com on August and received a confirmed flight booking. When he checked-in his ticket 3 hours before the flight we found out that it was not a valid ticket. We tried to ring the +448447747881 but to no success...""Sorry we are having technical difficulties. Please call again later""...so almost 2 hours trying same technical issues. Im glad that we were able to locate the Greece company through the invoice receipt and they were able to sort the problem 1.5 hrs before the flight. His flight was Auckland to Hongkong (boarding pass was issued at Auckland Airport) but the boarding pass for Hongkong to Cebu will be issued in Hongkong. Hopefully my son will reach his destination without any problem by tomorrow. I will never use this site MYTRIP.COM."
Absolutely DO NOT use my trips!!
"Absolutely DO NOT use my trips!! There is No way to contact them in time, I didnt receive email. for ticket . I had to book another flight with airline direct .they contacted me 2 months later cost me $700 dollars :( very pissed off with service will never use again , just book direct with airline is best"
yes I got ripped off too:( $700
"This company is awful. Yes they have discounted flights, but are not customer friendly. They will screw you! Stay clear of them. I accidentally proceeded with a purchase not realizing it. Ended up by 4 tickets, but really got 8 tickets for 4 people. They would t do the right thing and refund 4 of the tickets. So now I ha e 8 tickets on the same flight for 4 people. The worst company EVER! Stay clear"
Stay clear! This company will rip you off! Worst customer service ever. They are thieves
Terrible very shady company! Do t use this site EVER. They will scam you out of lots of money! What a fraud!
Don’t do it! Accidentally double booked for same flights. Now I have 8 tickets for 4 people and they wo t do the right thing g and refund one set. Said tough and hung up on me. Shady awful company and people. Stay clear
"I use mytrip.com for a flight to the Middle East (actually leaving coming weekend). I advice you to only use their website to find cheap flights but do not use them as your travel agent. Book your flights yourself, directly on the website of the airlines. The service of mytriip.com is a real mess.They even arranged a connecting flights with the arrival time of the first flight at exactly the same moment of the departure of the connecting flight. I am spending hours this week to correct their errors and have my trip correctly organised. If you phone their helpdesk they promise to arrange your problem but don't inform you about what they are doing, leaving you in complete uncertainty. Conclusion: good website but extremely bad and inefficient travel agency."
"They are NOT a travel agency, just an on-line ticket flogger."
"+1 Frommy.Cheap never buys you great or even good. No company can consistently sell a product below cost, provide great service and stay in business -it’s just not possible. If only folk would get that and search on reputation/reliability as well as price. Or just keep it simple and buy directly from the airline. It still,pays to read reviews of an airline you've never used before."
"I think it would undoubtedly help people if they realised that there is a difference between a booking site and a proper travel agency. The difficulty is that there are some decent travel agents that have a web presence, and it's easy for novice or inexperienced travellers to assume that all sites are the same."
"Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! I just had a dreadful experience with this company. Booked a flight and they did not divulge the terms and conditions of the ticket. So, when I needed to change the ticket, I could not. I never book inflexible tickets, because my diary changes all the time. I will never deal with them again, that's for sure. Expensive lesson learnt!"
"I had a very bad experience with Mytrip, we made a mistake buying tickets (bought 2 times a return ticket instead of a one way ticket and a return). Although on both bills figure the same people, same flight with 2 times the same names and that we immediately inform Mytrip, they did not want to hear and we were charged of 50 Euro cancellation fee per person.I strongly advise against buying your tickets on this company. And be careful GoToGate it's the same company !"
"Frederic, so you are admitting that you made a mistake and then you are unhappy when they have to charge a fee for doing work to cancel the tickets? You can’t expect them to work for free, correct?"
"Hello, I have also made a booking with mytrip...I have checked the actual airline site and used their (mytrip's) reference number and it brought me to my correct reservation, etc. I Called up the airline and bought an additionally leg room seat as well..and it was tied to my reservation and is now displayed on the actual airline confirmation page .. Should I still be concerned that the original ticket was bought through mytrip, even though i appear on he actual airline site as well. Could my trip ""magically"" somehow cancel my reservation last minute?Thanks for the help!"
"s f, take screen shots of your itinerary on the airline site. You should be fine."
"Similar story to yours, flights Bangkok to Larnaca, the second leg Tel Aviv to Larnaca cancelled, told simply to make alternative arrangements. Ignored emails, expensive telephone calss all to no avail. Do not use them."

"I have had the same issue, they even deny that my flights are on their system, lesson learned but I would not recommend them to anyone, also when you open some other sites make sure the My Trip logo does not come up because that is who you are dealing with."
"I was about the book the flight, Then realized it is asking my card details in a plain text."
"No, unfortunately the prices they showed were too good to be true. After sending over sensitive info to book flights for half a dozen members of my extended family, the platform would not process the transaction. After retrying several times (and an hour of time), I finally gave up on mytrip.com and moved on to book flights on another platform that worked.Don't be surprised if once they collect all your info, the prices change or tickets are no longer available. This is a recurring theme with mytrip.com. Best of luckEdited: 1 year ago "
"Can I please ask what sensitive info you sent to them and how? If it was emailing copies of passports and your credit card, then I would never do that just to book a flight."

My trip have let us down badly in recent trip. Changed ticket and never submitted new e-ticket. Had to buy new ticket at the airport on the day of departure. Watch out !
">> yes yes we wait for airlines refund <<have you spoken to the airline(s) and ask whether they have, or intend to, refund mytrip?was this all on one ticket? what happened at the airport? have you involved your travel insurance?"
"I will never allow my friends, relatives and colleagues suffer the same ordeal this Greek company have made me go through . By far the worst travel agency I have ever used. I will never ever use this site in the future and I will warn everyone that I know to avoid My trip.com like a disease. I hope their guilt will make you live their lives well after they robbed me off my hard earned money. How can you be allowed to operate in the UK when you don't even have a contactable number. You charge your costumer more than half of the airfare worth of penalties when they want their information changed. Even the actual Airline companies won't change half of what you are charging and just because you are not contactable you can very well do so?? I hope the watchdog will get you"
"“I hope their guilt will make you live their lives well after they robbed me off my hard earned money. How can you be allowed to operate in the UK when you don't even have a contactable number.”—-I think something’s lost in translation in that sentence, doesn’t make much sense to me. I guess you didn’t look hard enough for a contact number, there is a full page of them depending on where in the world you’re calling from.As to their additional charges for when you want to make a change, they are a business and you chose to book with them instead of direct with the airline. Do you expect them to make those changes for free? Of course they will add their fee on top of the airlines.https:/…local-telephone-numbers"
"First things first, in future book directly with the airline and avoid ticket floggers altogether.""more than half of the airfare worth of penalties when they want their information changed. Even the actual Airline companies won't change half of what you are charging""Mistakes in ticket information can be expensive. Further, the third party you have put by your free will between you and the airline wants to earn some money as well, and is not working for free.You have made two mistakes (going to a shonky third party and not giving correct information); and you pay the price. You have not been robbed."
">>>I will warn everyone that I know to avoid My trip.com like a disease.<<<Best of luck with that. I don't think your efforts will have any effect at all, sorry, but by all means give it a go.It's totally irrelevant what the airlines would charge, since you chose not to book with them, but to use a shoddy third party instead."
Pure cowboys. Booked £450 flight. Never got an email confirmation. These guys will steal your money.
"'Booked £450 flight. Never got an email confirmation.' Oh. Did you contact the airline to enquire if a booking had been made? Was your credit card charged? If there was a charge and the airline said a booking had been made then they should have been able to give you the PNR to use to manage your booking even if inept and useless mytrip.com hadn't sent the email.'These guys will steal your money.' Not necessarily, since the questions above are unanswered. They're still a waste of space, and as with others' complaints one does wonder why anyone would book with this lot."
"My trip has stolen my money. I booked and paid, then they told me there was a 'technical error"" and that they would refund me. So far, nothing. I lost all my money."
Contact your card provider and tell them what has happened.
"This is a really bad company. I had to cancel a flight due to a serious medical condition of my father. I provided all the medical documents. Zerina MANKOLLI a travel operation senior agent wrote to me in December: ""We would like to inform you that the airline company has rejected our full refund request and advise us to proceed only according to the fare rules. In this case, please note that there is a cancellation penalty of 120,00 euro charged by the airline company. Therefore, the refundable amount is 528,79 euro after deduction our service fee as well.""Maybe I don't understand but I felt after this message that Mytrip will give me a partial refund. Don't you agree? Unfortunately, I have to chase them by e-mails and phones(this costs money and time). Now Zerina wrote to me (2 months later): ""We would like to inform you that we have resubmitted a refund application to the airline company and we will be waiting for their response. "" Please, don't choose this company.Meny"
"Yes, it does look as though they have said that you are due a refund. However, that refund comes form the airline first, then the agent will deduct their fees and pass the remainder on to you.I have no clue as to whether the airline has refunded the company yet or not. Maybe you could ask the airline?"
"Hi I recently booked a return flight from Cape Town to Shanghai through Mytrip on Ethiopian Air. I was forced to delay the departure date due to issues with obtaining a visa for an extended visa - the Chinese do not issue tourist visas for more than 29 days.When I tried to change the trip online through Mytrip, I got no response. I called the local Air Ethiopia office, and was told I had to change the booking through the agent - Mytrip. Eventually I found a local number in Durban and was connected on a very bad line to a person who seemed barely able to speak English. When I eventually managed to explain what I wanted, she informed me that this would cost more than R15000 - almost double the original ticket. I was also informed that if I cancelled the flight I would receive no refund. Fortunately I then contacted the global Air Ethiopia cal centre - they were quite helpful and managed to change the ticket for a more reasonable fee. I would strongly advise against booking anything through Mytrip - rather book with the airline directly. In the end that will be cheaper - Mytrip is a scam.Edited: 1 year ago "
"It's cheap but you must be careful about this website. There is some hidden fee for seat selection. I just booked a ticket to go oversea, they added the fee for seat selection at the final price so be careful about that. You can actually select a seat from airplane by yourself after booking the ticket, without paying any extra fee. So, be careful from this website."
"""You can actually select a seat from airplane by yourself after booking the ticket, without paying any extra fee. So, be careful from this website.""---Some airlines do have a charge to select seats though."
"Utter nightmare of a company.They are not a UK company despite UK telephone number.I bought flights from them and three months later they tried changing what I paid for to a flight that was 18 hours longer than what I had booked and nearly £300 cheaper without any offer of compensation. They refused to offer any alternatives and tried passing me to the Airline who obviously just referred me back to the travel agency. Mytrip then demanded a £70 fee to offer an alternative, took money and did nothing just told the airline I had accepted the change which I had refused.I am now chasing them through courts (not easy with them being based in Greece) after they ignored 4 emails and 3 calls."
"There must be many companies who have a UK phone number but are based elsewhere. Don't rely on a phone number, look deeper into the site and find out where the company is registered.At the same time, check their reputation out in places like this. Yours is far from being the only complaint here about mytrip."
"Mytrip.com are not recommended.I pay 230 € for flullflex reebooking. When I tried to rebook the flight they wanted to take a full price ticket again, saying there wasn't other option. They are not real professional and they let me waiting on the phone. Never get a real answer. I feel helpless."
"Beware ! I searched for a flight on another site and it led me to MyTrip for the booking. Unbeknownst to me, the trip transferred with a destination of LAX instead of LAS and I missed this detail until I received the confirmation of the booking (my fault). I immediately tried to cancel the flight but could not find a contact method. Eventually I found an email address and sent off my cancellation. I then found an AU phone number so called and was told that there would be a $75 per head cancellation fee ! This was not mentioned anywhere on the site. I had 4 passengers so this was a huge cost for an immediate cancellation. The flight had not even been reserved by the carrier at this point (I called them to confirm this) so this was simply a fee from MyTrip. I then received a refund notice that stated the charge as $262 ! All of my transactions were in AU$ and the carrier was an AU carrier. Not once was any other currency mentioned.This site not only charges unspecified fees, but they also use currency conversions to rip off their customers. In my mind this is a misleading and fraudulent site."
"Well, Phil, considering that MyTrip are based in Greece .....To me it is more a case of not reading the T&C's before ticking the box to accept them."
"I'm afraid I agree with Frommy. You didn't notice that you were booking to LAX not LAS, you didn't check out My Trip and you didn't even read the T&C's you agreed to. I;m sorry, but there is no fraud here, just some carelessness."
this company are based in greece but give a u.k number i booked a flight for my girlfriend realised i i made a mistake on the spelling contacted them straight away they wasnt interested in helping i had to buy another ticket using another company absolute disgrace crap company
"I'm having a similar problem, I booked a flight Cucuta - Buenos Aires for my girlfriend and at first I could see the check in number in the official airline website. After awhile I entered to check it and no luck this time, I went to the airline offices here in Buenos Aires and they said since I booked through an agent there was nothing they could do about it. Contacting them (mytrip.com) was not only painfully hard but expensive. The ""local"" number they provide for Argentina did't help at all and they redirected me to the NY based customer support. After finally contact them, they claimed the airline had canceled the ticket and they'd be contacting me via email to further notice about my status but right now I'm worried this is a scam. I do not recommend this website at all"
Mauricio - you can avoid this in the future by booking flights direct with the airline on the airline website.I suspect they were unable to confirm your booking request (the price was not live) they generally contact you to ask for more money before the booking is auto-cancelled in the airline system due to not being paid in full. Have you checked your card statement? the hold should have dropped off after a few days...if not speak to them and request your money back
be very carefull. These people will take you to cleaners without a second thought.
Do not use Mytrip.com. !
"Do not EVER buy anything from this CRAP company! They're useless and don't give a sh** for their customers!I've been waiting for TWO weeks to cancel a flight and NOTHING happens! I call the flight company and they say, unfortunately, as I have bought the ticker from mytrip, they can't do nothig.RUN AWAY from this company!"
"Murilo, what were the fare rules of the ticket? most sold would be non-refundable bar some taxes less their fees.There are plenty warnings about buying from third parties instead of direct with the airline. If you want to be able to deal direct with the airline, you need to book with them and not have a shonky 'agent' in between"
No feedback from anybody. Lost case...
"I used them and they took money from my bank account and then refused to give me a ticket, they said I was a high-security risk, they wanted a photos of my card and passport, they only gave an hour to do this. I'm now stranded in Thailand because of metric, they are not legit. I know have to go to the British Consulate, i don't think I will get a refund. Disgraceful company, don't use it, if something seems a good deal then beware unless it is with an airline, these guys are criminals!"
You made a booking request and they are unable to fulfil that request (not uncommon with shonky third party sites)you will get your money returned to your account - speak to your card company if it has been more than 5 days. No need to be stranded - you can.purchase a ticket direct from the airline
"They first give you a good price, and then they say the flight is changed and if you like to reschedule you need to pay 69 UK lb. Worst customer support ever. They will rip you off!"
Ok x
Horrible experience with them. They mixed up my name when purchasing the ticket and I had to pay for the mistake.
"please be aware - this company doesn't notify on flight changes, and doesn't answer on emails. we stayed 2 days more in Bangkok due to this guys."
I got a really cheap flight on mytrip.com (via sky scanner) and everything went smoothly with my flight Cape Town - Frankfurt return (Air Namibia). The Mytrip help desk responded quickly to all my requests and inquiries.
"We used this site in October 2018 and we had issues with and missed our flights. We contacted them and they promised refund by November and every month I emailed to remind them our refund, they reply that someone will contact us soon. I rang this England number +44 8447747881 but no answer.Did anyone had dealing with them in the past?"
"This is a global known thing that a return ticket is cheaper than a One way ticket. I booked a one way ticket with Mytrip from London to Mumbai by paying more than what the return ticket would have cost. I know this because on the same day within few minutes difference i have booked a return ticket for me from another agent. Now what travel troleey smartly did is booked a return ticket ,kept this information secret and sent me a one way ticket, When i browsed the airlines website,I saw a return ticket. I called MyTrip to cancel the return ticket and they do not want to do that saying this is a system thing and I can complain anywhere I want."
so you wanted a one-way ticket...how much was the real price of the one-way ticket on the airline website compared to what you paid. Someone posted something similar recently...you could tell them you asked for a one-way ticket so you would like it priced correctly as a one-way and you would like to pay the extra.not sure it is is Travel Trolley or MyTrip you requested to book your flight (you mention both) but a few minutes research may make you think differently when you try and purchase an airline ticket next
Beware. When using this site take a screen shot of every step of your booking.
"Trevor I don’t get your post. You’re warning everyone to be wary of this website, yet saying take a screenshot of the booking process. Why not just avoid using a website where you’ve had issues. What am I missing?"
Bought flight tickets from them to Rom last December.I was supposed to go next July. Flight was canceled.Having a hard time getting refund. Avoid at all cost!Einar haraldsson
"I used them recently.I bought a flex-ticket upgrade as my business meetings were not all fixed yet. Turns out you cannot change your ticket online, you have to call the call center. The wait time for the call center was long, the English call center agent struggled with English. Lastly, the flex-ticket is not really flexi, you can move the ticket, but cannot change anything except the departure time.Their support response time is typically 5 working days and then they reply with canned answers.DO NOT USE if you’re serious about travel."
"So many people purchase non-refundable/non-flexible tickets and come on here to complain about the high change fees or the inability to make changes at all. Of course, even if you do shell out the extra money and purchase a “flexible” ticket, you are still going to be stuck with dealing with the notoriously terrible customer service that mytrip offers. Mytrip is not a travel agent; it is a ticket flogger. Why would you want to leave them in charge of making changes on a ticket? If you know in advance that plans are not set in stone enough that you need to buy flexible ticket, the only only sensible option is to go directly through the airline."
Quite correct. Risky business in my view. Go elsewhere.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! I especially paid extra for a flexible ticket and service support and they have been of no help whatsoever!! I have phone many times and sent emails but they still haven’t been able to change my ticket!
"KUDNXL. Someone woke up and decided to cancel my flight to Las Vegas CGKPZQ 6 days from my scheduled departure. Despite never asking for this cancellation, no one had the common courtesy to call me and advise. Had I not called to investigate upon receipt of an illegitimate-looking email, I would've only realized this nonsense at the airport.4 days have since passed and I have now spent over 6 combined hours on the phone with reps in India (Sanar, Akash, Gautam, Subhadeet, & Gagan). My issue remains unresolved and my ticket is yet to be reinstated. I am now 2 days out from my planned departure with my friends, yet no resolution. They keep asking me to wait longer to review my calls to verify that I did NOT ask them to cancel said flight. Even after speaking with the same representative who confirmed that he remembers speaking with me and that I in-fact did NOT ask them to cancel said flight, I am still in limbo without my ticket. I have now filed an official complaint to customer.relations@etraveli.com. Updates to follow."
"""Someone woke up and decided to cancel my flight to Las Vegas ""----Publishing your booking reference or PNR on a public forum like you have certainly isn't a good idea if you're worried about someone cancelling your booking."
"According to my experience, u get the TKT. Buy if you need any service from them,forget about reaching them as they neither reply your mails or pick up their phone. Even if you have bought their cancellation protection , it doesn't work if u want to cancel ,as it is not cancelled until they reply to u,which is almost next to impossible. Booking thru this site is huge risk."
i’d book air ticket with mytrip.com from SIN-USM everything is good doesn’t have any issue fast and smooth !
"It was so stressful and frustrated booking with mytrip.com. Their customer service was unbelievably terrible. I paid and got confirmation letter, e ticket receipt and was ready to head to the airport. Just when I went to the airline website to check in ,I found out there was no booking under my name. I called mytrip yet they said they had no ideas.I had no choice but rushing to the airport and the airline agent there helped me out. First time and undoubtedly last time going to mytrip.com. P/s: their representatives were rude too when they keep cutting me off saying they couldn't stay on the line with me."
“Their customer service was unbelievably terrible.”100% disagree. Their customer is beyond believably terrible. It is extremely well-documented and well-known how terrible their customer service is; this thread alone is a small portion of the proof. What would truly be unbelievable is if you had received good customer service.
the price is real but we have a very bad experience regarding their communication. Our flight was cancelled by the airline and they refused to return us the money. They have no email and you have to wait for a very long time in the queue before connecting to anybody. Do not recommend at all. Better to buy it directly with the airline.
"Hi everyone, my experience with Mytip.com is pretty similar to everyone here. My family had booked a ticket to Phuket Thailand in January for a trip at the end of April. We got a really good price and we received confirmation that everything was fine. We had a good experience with them when booking to Seoul, Korea from Japan. Anyways a few days later our headache started. They said that the airline was overbooked and gave us a new flight. If we agree to this flight there would be no charge. It was annoying but we would still be able to make our flight so we agreed. Then a few days later another email came that said that flight was overbooked too. But what's even worse is that we have a connecting flight at an airport that is 1.5 hours away and only 45 mind to get there. So they said if we wanted a flight that would work we would have to pay them a change fee times the number of passengers. So we called them to make the change. They said they would work on it. After 2 weeks without any response so we started calling more often. They finally made the change. The worst part was that they gave us the same exact ticket we had in the first place. We waited for the eticket to come for over a week and a half and it didn't come. We called back and found out that we actually didn't have a ticket and that they were still actually trying to get us a ticket and we were on a waiting list. Fed up we canceled our tickets after being lied to, given the run around and all the time and stress it has caused. We ended booking a flight with another company. Any connecting flights are bad news with Mytrip.com we do not recommend to use them. At least they had refunded our tickets but it cost us 28% of our ticket price including change fees. Do Not Use Mytrip.com!"
"“We ended booking a flight with another company.“It’s always a bit depressing to read one of these tales of woe and then see the poster has learned absolutely nothing from the experience. Why, after all this drama, would you not cut out the middleman and book directly with the airline. Mytrip is shoddy, but hardly the worst- that dubious honor goes to Kiwi, followed by eDreams, Travelgenio and Bravofly. But direct and save the headache!"
"Very much a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire. But a lot of people think that when they have problems using a third party booking site it's the exception not the rule. I see i as the latter. Noit everyone has trouble, some bookings actually go OK, but between being asked to pay more, having to pay high fees for rescheduling or cancelling tickets, plus very poor customer service and support, the chances of having issues is way too high for my liking.I find flying stressful enough without adding mickey mouse companies in to the mix (no offence, Mickey)."
Thank you for your comments. We decided to use Expedia as we have never had any problems with them. They are comparable in price to the airline but they provide packages with hotels and rental cars so it's been really good for us. We tried using the cheapest airline route and it's a lesson learned
"Eric Y, whilst Expedia are one of the better online companies and can do packages, you still have the down sides when something goes wrong of trying to get a hold of a middleman and paying them fees to deal with it. There are quite a few complaints about their customer support service not being greatHave you a reason why you don’t just book directly?I.dont need persuading to book directly as it’s my preferred option but if I did you just need to look at the Jet Airways collapse where the likes of KLM were sorting out their own customers but those that had used agents were struggling to get them to speak to the airlines on their behalf."
I got scammed by mytrip!!! Jet Airways cancelled the flight. Confirmed I would get a refund via mytrip and it has been over a month...when you try to contact them it's just a nightmare!|
"Same here, they refuse to answer any of my emails and I needed to make changes to my flight so I could get home earlier as it is an emergency.They aren’t ABTA members, which basically means a harsh lesson learnt for myself."
"If you’re having an emergency, why not make a claim through your travel insurance. Unless this emergency is not covered by your policy? Did you purchase a flexible ticket from mytrip? (I assume not, as they mostly sell non-refundable, highly restrictive fares.)It might cost you far more to change the ticket rather than just purchasing a new one, especially if your travel insurance can come through for you."
"I think it's possible that it may not be possible to change your flight if the ticket rules or agent's policies prohibit it. That may be why MyTrip are not responding.Or, of course, it could just be because they are utter crap."
"They are very shady & dodgy!! I have booked & paid for my flight to Bonn. They sent me the ticket itinerary, when I try to communicate with them their system wants an eticket reference from me, which they haven't given me. One FERIAL STEMMET responds to my email wanting details I booked with, and since I responded this individual has not shown up!! Literally disappeared!!!"
"Take care, they are scams... They send you the ticket but have no agency, what means that after your ticket is send, you have no way to change, improve or claim..."
"i have recently used this service, and have learnt my lesson, i should have known better, all i bought was being stranded at airport, i paid extra money for extra support just incase something like this emergency may have happened, but zero support for me no matter how i tried and impossible to get my refund or anything, this is the constant email i get back.Dear Sir/Madam,Right now we have longer than usual response time to e-mail. We are sorry for the inconvenience and we will get back to you shortly.Please note that this is an automatically generated e-mail.Kind regards,MytripBut they never get back and wont or dont give me my refundEdited: 1 year ago "
"That. answer was given to me 3 years ago.... Is the same scam,.."
"The call centre is absolutely hopeless I had rang them numerous time to get a name fixed on airline ticket. They just kept telling me that they will do it I just have to wait as there are people who are flying out int he next 48 hrs that they are helping Then when I only had 48 hrs they said oh we can not do anything cause it is less than 48 hrs before you travel an that I had to ring the airline myself and they will do it. Because I had already rang the airline who told me they couldn't do it because the booking belonged to the agent I refused to give in and would not let them hang up so in the end they offered to charge me $380 do it at that stage I was willing but the payment link they sent me would allow me to make the payment. So then they wanted me to pay by credit card and I refused to give them that over the phone. So they released my travel to the airline who charged me $40. Clearly the just don't know how to do anything so they muck you around until it is too late. They will rip you off, I will never use them again even if they were half the price of everyone else. TRUST ME IT ISN'T WORTH IT. If you have booked with them and have a problem just persist and persist until they do something don't hang up, do not except anything they say as it constantly changes."
"Are you not shameless? Reading the various complaints do you find normal so many problems ?! How are you still operating ?!You have a poor service channel, almost nonexistent. Contact by phone only if it is rich. By email, it takes 1 day at least to receive a return, worse than without any plausible solution. Mytrip wanted to change my flight for 3 days after planned, how could it ?! You think people have no commitments. You have the courage to talk to get in touch with the company airway to solve the case. ridiculous! Anyway, as I had a commitment I had to return on schedule and had to buy a ticket directly at the airport, I paid almost double the amount. I want to know how I will do to have the reimbursement of my expenses ?! I've deposited mytrip tickets to Mytrip, if there were any problems like Mytrip informs, that you take the necessary steps. I sent some 10 emails to Mytrip and so far I did not get any return."
"I assume you're asking these questions of mytrip, Marcelo? They won't answer, but I can tell you that the reason that they don't care about complaints and that the reason they are still operating are exactly the same.It's because they know full well that no matter how bad (or shameless) they are, no matter that their reputation might be lower than a snake's rear end, they will continue to get people using them who have not bothered to spend two minutes checking them out first.Good luck with persevering in getting money out of the,. I fear you're going to need it."
I booked flight tickets from trip.com and after purchase they provided me a wrong booking number. I checked with the airlines website and could locate my booking. When I called customer service they told me they cannot call the airline to sort out the problem and I need to call them directly. The airline was based in Mexico and the call incurred additional changes to me. Eventually I called the airline and got the correct booking number but lessons learnt NEVER BOOK WITH TRIP.COM
Steer well clear of these fraudsters. They are impossible to get in contact with and send you on a wild goose chase with the airlines for fixes they should be doing. Do not use under any circumstances!!!! Scam artists.

"I know it might be a little too late, but do NOT book with them. They charge a fee just to rebook an itinerary change. They don't help you whatsoever unless you pay them more. They allowed an itinerary change a month after I booked, where my connection flight departed before I arrived in that city and now I can't get them to help me. Unless you want to call them (in England) everyday to find help, since they don't answer the email address they clam they answer to, do not book with them. By the way, they're still dragging their feet on my issue as of today."
"I understand them charging extra fees. Most third party booking sites will do exactly the same one way or another. I can't blame them for not wanting to work for nothing, and these fees are how they make their money.But please don't think I'm defending MyTrip. They are poor and I wouldn't go near them."
"Never make any reservations with mytrip.com, a Greek company. They get free money from you. The way they do it: you make a flight reservation with payment for extra's, such as luggage insurrance, seat selection etc. Then you receive a mail saying one of the flights is cancelled. They ask you to make a payment for the administrative charges and then, some weeks later (after endless phone calls), they say they cannot replace the flight (in our case a short European flight amongst a big trip to Asia). What they then do is refund the flight, but not the extra's: luggage, seat selection, administrative charges... We tried to negociate with them, but they never replied to any of our e-mails. This company is getting several hundreds of free euros from you !!!!"
"If TripAdvisor is still allowing people to book through Mytrip.com, then they are doing themselves a big disservice. This is the worst travel agency that I have ever dealt with in my entire life. I booked a flight a few months back and needed to make a name change, so naturally I called their number. No live person. No automated system to make changes. Only a message stating their hours. THATS IT. So I emailed them because I really wanted to make sure that these changes were made and we didn't run into any issues at the airport. That was over a month ago and ZERO RESPONSE. None. Nothing at all. I contacted the site that I initially set this up with and they got them to respond to me the next day. Lo and behold, they are now saying that it is too late to make changes and I would have to cancel my flight and re-book a flight with the changes.Completely absurd and the worst experience that I have ever had with a company that supposedly has 1.3 million satisfied customers. Check anywhere online about them and you will see that everyone feels the same way as me. DO NOT BOOK THROUGH MYTRIP.COM. EVER."
">> Check anywhere online about them and you will see that everyone feels the same way as me <<which is why you should check a company out before giving them money...or better still, book direct with the airlineTripAdvisor allows paid adverts, google allows paid adverts, your newspaper allows paid adverts, paid adverts are shown on tv....if google etc didn't allow shonky third parties to advertise they would lose revenue. It does not mean that your newspaper, tv station, TA or Google is recommending these companies.Little / no customer service goes hand in hand with 'cheap'Very few airlines allow name changes so cancelling and booking a new ticket may be the only way. Which airline were you booked with?"
"was the ""name change"" a spelling correction, or a change of passenger? To me it sounds like the latter, and that AFAIK is not allowed by any airline."
"“If TripAdvisor is still allowing people to book through Mytrip.com, then they are doing themselves a big disservice.”TA isn’t allowing (or no allowing) people to do anything. If I recall correctly, we still have free will and are able to select the companies we want to deal with. TA doesn’t support, promote or recommend any companies, let alone “allow” anyone to use them. Doing research should be done before using a company, not after. Otherwise, what’s the point of the research? Name changes are usually big deals; even spelling errors will often carry high fees. The fact that you put a shoddy middleman between you and the airline is something you will have to explain to yourself. No one books with a shonky middleman expecting good (or any!) customer service."
"I recently booked a trip though mytrip.com, I booked the night before, meaning the tickets were still pricey, but compared to other websites, it was much cheaper. Since I really needed this flight, I didn’t think much into reading reviews, not until a few hours later, when I had already purchased my tickets. I became really wary of reading all the reviews and began to worry that something like that would happen to me. Fortunately, nothing changed. My flight was on time, both flights (layover). I did fly from Texas, USA to California, USA. I noticed most people reviewing were from overseas. I did also book just a one way trip. Still will be monitoring regarding the comments about extra charges on the card and will update."
"I have had a very bad experience. I received an email from them that the first leg of my flight (with Qatar) was cancelled and I was given the option of either cancelling my whole purchase or to have that first leg a day earlier and stay a whole day between the two legs. I called every night for 5 nights in a row (they have only limited opening hours based in Greece and I live in the US) but they were never helpful and I was getting different info from each agent about whether a more reasonable connection can be found, whether they did contact the airline etc. Every single time I would ask to talk to a supervisor I was put on hold for 10mins and then the line would drop. I ended up accepting their horrible rebooking. When I later called the airline they told me that my first leg would fly fine (only the codeshare of Quatar with Jetblue was cancelled, not the Jetblue flight), but the airline could not do anything at that point as it is a mytrp.com issue and they rebooked it. One of the worse experiences. Avoid it!"
"We had a horrible experience booking the tickets to Iceland. The rates kept on changing as we proceeded with the booking. They started charging extra money for blocking the seat positions. At the end we wanted to complete the booking. In fact, we received the OTP for completing the transaction. Then my son made a final check and found that this is not a reliable site. I sincerely feel this is not to be relied upon for booking airline tickets."
"Mytrip.com is not a reliable travel agency, do not use them!We had a flight booked from Hoedspruit to Johannesburg and from Johannesburg to Windhoek. The last flight to Windhoek was cancelled and we paid MyTrip the service fee to make replacing travel arrangements. Despite several calls to their help line nothing happened. They always promised that we would have a replacing flight and we would just need to wait for a confirmation email. We did not receive one single email. Finally we had to book new flights ourselves and we are still wondering if we ever receive any refund from all this mess."
"Whatever you do, please refrain from doing business with this provider.. I booked a ticket with an airline that change all my Trip itinerary making me loss connecting flights, ground transportation, etc . I attempted to contact this provider by phone, email, letter, etc to no avail neither the Airline of this provided responded. They just responded after I started to post bad reviews sending me an email advising on contacting the airline... this was 6 MONTHS LATER!!. a complaint with the FAA and the Better Business Bureau was filed. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!"
Hi Ramank. I'm sorry you had such a tough time. Next time save yourself from dealing with a middle-person and book directly with the airline.
its a scam do not give them money. they scammed me 200 pounds
Don't use this website! They are not answering for the emails and even didn't pick up any call from me. I was waiting on the line for many-many hours but couldn't reach them! I also don't recommend Turkish airlines they are the same!!!!!!! They treat their customers like stupid/foolish idiots :(
"If you booked a Turkish airlines flight through mytrip you are not their customer. If you want to be able to deal directly with the airline, book directly with them"
"You have unfairly criticised the airline when you are not their customer. As Carol said, the useless agent you appointed is the customer of the airline, not you."
“They treat their customers like stupid/foolish idiots”—-I’d say it’s also slightly foolish to have your TA username the same as an airline you appear to dislike.
"Don't use this website for booking an air ticket. I used once but decided to cancel my trip. Their customer service is terrible terrible terrible. They will different tactics such as delay in the telephone conversation, bring excuses of airline policy and so on to just get your money. their HQ is in the UK but they made their website and email in such a way that you think it is a local business or has a branch, at least. But that is fake. I used once, and I put this comment here to let other people know and don't use it."
"Wish I had read this before booking. My price didn't raise but I heard from a friend who bought her flight with another company, that the flight was cancelled. I can't get a hold of MyTrip and have no clue how it will go.Do not book with these guys!! Not worth it!"
"Mytrip.com is a fraud, I booked my flight to Karachi, Pakistan from Manchester, United Kingdom Turkish Airlines through Mytrip.com and before the travel date they sent me an email that my flight is rescheduled and I have to travel two days in advance and my transit time in turkey increased from 4 hours to 1 day. My plans could not allow me to travel 2 days earlier for obvious reasons then I cancelled the flight through turkish airlines website and Turkish airlines told me that the agent is liable to give the refund. From that day till now I have been contacting mytrip.com through facebook page, through email, through phone but no suitable reply. Finally I asked my bank and claimed for a chargeback and I recevied the chargeback, NEVER book through mytrip.com. They are fraud."
I'm glad you were able to get the charge cancelled. Next time book directly with the airline to avoid these types of issues with third party agents.
Terrible experience! My uncle wrote his name wrong when booking his ticked and we tried for over 2 and a half week to get a name change. We never heard back from mytrip service team once in this whole time and we had to call them over 8 times to get some feedback on how our request was being handled. We sometimes had to wait over 20 minutes for our calls to be answered. Its just terrible terrible TERRIBLE service. In the end we had to buy a new ticket because it was clear they were doing nothing to get this done. I asked for his plane ticket to be cancelled via call. They could not ever do that right and the ticket was not cancelled. Please be careful with this company!
"wherever you are booking it is important to make sure the details you input are correct. Had your uncle booked directly with the airline, they may have been able to do a name correction (possibly for a fee) or cancel for free within 24 hours of booking.Making an error on the third party flogger site can be very expensive as you have found. Their terrible service is well documented in common with the majority of the ticket floggers - cheap tickets = cheap service...they can manage to attract`customers without providing a good service so don't need to cut into their profits by providing one.Hopefully your uncle will look to the airline website for future bookings"
"I tried booking domestic flight .The amount got debited but no mention of any booking id or so,even when tried to contact with customer care there is no response from it.Worst experience ever."
"How long ago did you make this booking request (not a booking)? They can take up to 48 hours to confirm a request, so if it hasn’t been that long yet you need to wait. If it’s over 48 hours contact your credit card and start chargeback proceedings."
Absolutely not. I had the worst experience ever with them. Do not ever try them
"Do NOT use mytrip.com to book flights. I booked flights from Juba to Olbia only to arrive in Olbia and find my connecting flight had been mysteriously cancelled. I rang Mytrip contact number from Italy to London three times to be put on hold for half an hour each time and then be cut off. The last person I spoke to told me not to be ""discouraged"" and put me on hold again for half an hour to speak to an agent. The agent then said there was nothing Mytrip could do because the ticket had been booked by Ethiopian Airlines which had cancelled the connecting flight so I had to speak directly to Ethiopian. What is the point of going through a broker if they can't help you. They also should have told me this immediately when I called the first time to contact the airline instead of forcing me to make 3 expensive phone calls to get them to respond. I ended up having to rebook my flight at the airport with AlItalia myself. When I told the contact centre on Mytrip that I would put a negative review online, they said they didn't care. If you use this service, don't expect them to help you when things go wrong. My advice is to book directly with the airline rather than waste money on a broker that doesn't respond or care when your travel arrangements go wrong"
">> they said they didn't care <<that is obvious, there are 1,000s of complaints about them but they still get people wanting to give them their money. They don't even need to spend money being good and provide a decent service either (just display a cheap fare) and they have a flock of customers keeping them in businessIt's good advice to book direct with the airline, unfortunately it will likely not save anyone as they will likely not check before clicking"
"“What is the point of going through a broker if they can't help you.”They are not a travel agent. They are a ticket flogger. A shoddy third party middleman. This is evident from the thousands of reviews going back years. They are terrible, but one also shouldn’t expect them to be more than they are. When was your flight canceled? (How far in advance of your flight?) were you not monitoring the flights to notice it was canceled? What happened when you did online check in 24 hours in advance ? You checked in or not?"
"If I find that a connecting flight is cancelled, I contact the airline to get rebooked. I will do that either in the airport, online or by phone as long as I;m sorted out, preferably with a minimum of fuss.If I used a booking site there's no way I'd try and go through them. They are all generally difficult to contact, unresponsive and don't give a fig about satisfying paying customers, as they know they will continue to get more people using them no matter how poor they are.Thankfully, I already book directly every time so there's no chance of me ever being foolish enough to think that a third party would be able to sort out any problems arising from a cancelled flight."
"Don’t use this site , I booked 3 flights and wanted to change the name but they said it not possible, charged me £90 and now want give me my 705 pounds back .... stay well clear !!! Best booking direct as they are third party con merchants!!! No boss to speak too ."
Stay well clear !!! Con merchants rob me on 705 pound!!! Pakistan run company best book direct !!! Leing thieves. !!!!!
Was it a name correction (for a misspelt name) or a name change to a different passenger? The lTter is rarely permitted by any airline.
don't trust them. stay away...
>> Pakistan run company <<mytrip is a Greek company !!!Governing law Greek law applies exclusively to these T&Cs and the contract between You and us.
yes it is legit.the rebooking process tho is sh1tty. They will give you a number to call wich pretty much cant be called. The number is in the UK so you will also get charged international calling rates. They only accept calls at certain times depending on your country of origin.I would suggest booking at trusted sites with good reviews rather than goin thru all the trouble of reaching mytrip.com's representatives
"To be fair, if you're actually in the UK you won't be charged for an international phone call!But, of course, I still would not go anywhere near them!"
"Booking number : LLMXQIBooking number : LLMXQII booked three tickets using this companys website. All the way while making the payment they kept telling me that they are going to charge me a price of 1539 pounds (including taxes and discount), however once I submitted the bank card details and checked my account following the payment they charged me 1567 pounds. While this is a marginal payment differrence they didnt inform me at any stage that they are going to charge me extra 29 pounds. They just took this extra money out of account as soon as i submitted the payment button, without notifying their intent to do so. FRAUD, be aware."
"There are some ways you can prevent fraud yourself. Not publishing your booking number for a flight, or other personal information in a public forum is one such way."
You must have known that they would charge a fee as you read the T&C's. Or did you just tick the box to say you had read them?
"The Terms and Conditions are very clear about extra fees. It appears the only fraud committed was by you, claiming you had read and understood the terms and conditions when you hadn’t."
"Yes, I think you skipped reading the T&C's. If you had done so maybe you would have realised that Edreams don't work for nothing. As long as they have mentioned the additional charges somewhere, and they are too savvy not to, then it's not fraud at all. It's user carelessness or laziness."
I would not trust this company. I had my flight cancelled by Air Maroc. I was told within 6 weeks the travel agent would refund me. I have checked with Airline and they refunded the money back to agent in May. I have had broken promises of calls back from managers/ emails promised to be sent but never received and promise that my money that was due to be refunded by May 18th would be sent. Mytrip are legally obliged to pay this money back yet do not. So now I have to take further action to get this money returned. I cannot believe am the only one. But my suggestion is pay a bit more and go with a company that cares about it's customer relations. Not a company that chooses to illegally hold onto a customers money. As of this moment am still battling to get the money refunded.
"Richard, once you had found out that the airline had refunded the money to mytrip, why didn’t you open a dispute with your credit card to get the money back?"
"Hello, I just booked my flight through my trip and am now freaking out after reading these awful reviews :( How did your mum check in for her flight as I cannot find the e-ticket numberthanksMelisa"

"On jetcost.com, I saw a deal at 108€ for a one-way flight within Europe and I decided to proceed with my booking. That was the start of my horrible experience with mytrip.com.I added my check-in luggage, which was a very confusing phase since it did not show me any information on the number of accepted luggage, whether the on-flight luggage is included in the ticket etc.; okay, it was fine. I moved on, and I noticed that they increased the initial discounted fee of 108€ to 122€ for some reason + I saw this message written small next to the price: (depending on the payment type); this is when my suspicion incurred. Since I was going to pay with a visa debit card though, I thought that there would be no fee then I added my card number and clicked on the pay button. But, voila! The price jumped to almost 170€ from 143€ 'when I clicked' on the pay button from what I remember. I closed the window to stop the payment, but not surprisingly, I got an email right away that my booking was confirmed. Who would not be confused and upset in this situation? So I contacted the customer ""service"" team, and this was absolutely the worst part. 1. I messaged the company's Facebook account since the website's booking page did not get me to anywhere.2. No one replied the day, so I called the local line; it didn't even ring which implies it was never supposed to work. 3. I called the UK line and the answer I got from an agent in a rather-aggressive tone was: ""pay the extra fee of 51€ if you want to cancel, then you will get the refund in 7-10 days"". I didn't cancel, because I neither wanted to pay the extra fee that was worth 1/3 of the ticket nor I could easily imagine all the bs I would have to go through.4. The next day, I had to deal with an even more unpleasant agent who was giving me a 'lesson': ""kindly note that reviews are not representative of a company and we do inform people about the fee"", when I gave them a feedback that if they want to increase a certain fee, it would be better to make it as a pop-up or something similar so people can easily read it and be sure about it, wishing there will be no more victims as me.Their hyper passive-aggressive comments continued and now I am writing a review for an airfare website, which I have never done in my life until now, because I have always appreciated the service anyway and I have never encountered this kind of crappy treatment before.I genuinely regret that I have had to deal with this sort of company that does not even accept feedback but just want to argue with the customer and keep ripping off people with the shallow trick of increasing the fee in the last minute.I really hope my review will somehow help everyone of you here possibly avoid this nightmare, also, even if you would see a significantly lower price than what the other providers offer, don't get excited because they are going to raise it anyway in a ridiculous way."
"Hi Helgon, please there's no need to spam the forum. You've already posted this in another thread.Edited: 1 year ago "
Please avoid using this company! They will not reply to any emails calls etc.. absolute disgrace of a company
"No! They are the worst organisation I've ever dealt with, in terms of customer service.Stay clear of these people!"
They are not to be trusted! I have had such a bad experience with them.
"This is an old question but as it's a high rank on Google I said I'd reply. I booked flights with MyTrip, realised I had booked the wrong dates, called them up. Their customer service was open past normal hours (at 20.30), their staff were very helpful, and I was able to get my refund (except for a very fair admin fee). I was pleasantly surprised - enough to come and leave a positive review. Thanks guys."
"Yes have used, its the worst company I have ever used during my 56years . Lying, cheating for money on people etc...Had to cancel a flight and was totally abused by impolite personell that lied that they had made refunds though they never did despite of endless phone calls and mail correspondance during one month ....never ever again, to be honest it got me to hate British people forever really"
">> to be honest it got me to hate British people forever really <<confused?Mytrip is part of OY SRG Finland AB which is owned by Etraveli Group AB (publ)Etraveli AB • Dragarbrunnsgatan 46, 6th Floor • P.O Box 1340 • S- 751 43 Uppsala, Sweden •"
"Seriously you hate an entire nation’s people on the basis of a bad experience with a single company that isn’t even British?Perhaps do some research before buying in the future. There are plenty of complaints about this company already, if only you’d bothered to look."
I spend $1500 on flights with them and they took the money and never provided the flights. None of their contact numbers work. They don't respond to email. 100% thieves
How long since you made a booking request? If it has been over 48 hours then contact your card company to sort refund then book direct with the airline.$1500 is a lot of money to pass to a company without doing any research first.
I wish I had so much money I could just fling $1500 at some random site without checking first!
"I was volunteering in a class on staying safe online yesterday, the first main bullet re booking flights / holidaysSafe BookingEnsure that any holiday or travel company unfamiliar to you is reputable by researching them online. Ensure that they are a member of a recognised travel authority which offers financial protection and a complaints service. you would think it would be common sense but it is a step that many third party bookers miss. (randomly picking cheapest price)"
"Raymond, you must work for MyTrip"
I have the same problem. Were you able to get your refund?

"AWFUL! They charge almost three times the fees for cancellation or modification than an airline does. They charge you the airline fee plus their fee which is twice the airline's. Absolutely nonsense!Spanish Customer Service is so rude, I really cannot understand how this company exists. Probably only survives with first-time users which don't know the terrible service that will come. Also, they give you wrong reservations numbers and references. Better to pay little more in the airline site and be certain of what to expect."
"Very unhelpful and unco-operative, refused to rectify spelling mistake in name. I will NEVER use them again!!"
"""Very unhelpful and unco-operative, refused to rectify spelling mistake in name. I will NEVER use them again!!""Well, I'll never use them either, but to be fair, some airlines won't allow name changes or name corrections, and others will. If your flight was with a no-change airline, there's nothing anyone can do."
I think 10 of us have just been scammed... Watch this space

Stop spamming the forum with the same complaint.It’s ironic you telling people to look at the reviews. Whey didn’t you?
"Hello everyone,Please try not to use them.I bkg flight from Sofia, Bulgaria to Montreal Canada with Turkish airline.They canceled the connection flight so i apply for total refund.8 weeks after no money, almost 6000 cad.I had to go to Turkish Airline directly for the money.No get them back yet.As per customer service it is India based business."
"Have you tried speaking with your credit card provider, see if they can assist?"
"It's as simple as this: Do NOT book with Mytrip.My partner and I booked an itinerary from Mytrip that had us fly from Japan to Korea en route to Taiwan (our final destination). There is a total transit time of 1 hour and 15 minutes. Keep in mind that in most cases with transfers, your baggage can directly be delivered to the final destination as long as they arrive at and depart from the same terminal. However, this was not the case with this Mytrip itinerary. When we checked in for our first flight to Korea, we had been informed by the airline staff that we would have to claim our baggage and check-in again for the transit flight to Taiwan at Incheon Korea Airport. This message was no where available on the Mytrip website when we booked this itinerary. If it were, we would have moved on to another itinerary that was actually POSSIBLE to follow.This is what went down. When checking in to our first flight to Korea, we successfully requested to be seated in the first row of the aircraft so that we are the first to dash out upon landing. Once the aircraft doors opened, my partner and I sprinted to immigration; then to baggage claim; arrived at the carousel before the baggages even arrived; picked up our baggages; and then sprinted to the check in counter for the transit flight to only arrive when our transit flight had departed. There was not even enough time to complete the rest of the process in catching the transit flight: check in; security check; immigration; head to boarding gate (in which your presence at the gate is expected 30 minutes prior to departure).This itinerary was IMPOSSIBLE in the first place, no matter your first flight arrived in Korea on time or not, and no matter how fast you run. We contacted Mytrip on two instances to voice:1. Impossible itineraries as such that we experienced should not be sold;2. If they were to be sold, Mytrip should at the very least disclose to clients that baggage claim and a second check-in is required during transit on the booking webpage. If customers decide to move forward in purchasing the itinerary, they are doing so at their own risk.Mytrip's immediate response was to cancel our booking and claim that they ""can no longer do anything about it."" Frankly, they did not even care for our feedback on how to enhance their platform.One statement to conclude the above: Mytrip irresponsibly cheats their customers and for those who are considering to book a trip with them, do NOT."
"Which airlines were involved? Sounds like Mytrip booked you two separate tickets, which is a common practice of one other third party (Kiwi). In that case, you didn’t have a connecting flight."
"Unfortunately I chose to book a flight with my trip.com rather than Vayama who I normally book through and thanks to a visa problem am now down €800, the service packages and flight change charges are nothing short of extortion and they have the worst customer service in the known universe. So, basically they are legit, as in legitimate con artists.Edited: 1 year ago "
So you booked a non-refundable non-changeable flight without having your travel paperwork in order? That is not the fault of mytrip - that's 100% on you.-JimG
>> thanks to a visa problem am now down €800 <<your visa problem does not change the fare rules of the ticket. If you requested a non-refundable ticket that is what you will have got. Likewise change fees with be related to the airline fare rules (plus mytrip fee no doubt)If you needed a refundable ticket you should have purchased one from the airline (third party ticket floggers tend to sell the cheapest most restricted tickets)
"And Vayama??? They are one of the shoddiest lot around! Not as bad as Kiwi, but certainly on par with eDreams. Vayama’s customer service is notorious for being some of the worst in the business. The solution is A) have your travel docs sorted regardless of whom you book with and B) book directly with the airline and don’t bounce from one shoddy third party middleman to another."
"Do you believe that things would have been any different with Vayama, James?"
Keep clear - poor service and wanted to charge $1000 to change a flight that was booked les than 24 hours ago -
"Did you check when you booked the ticket how much it would cost to change it?Normally if you are unwise enough to book through an on-line ticket flogger instead of the airline itself, the change costs are made up of:Change fee charged by the airlineDifference in fare between the ticket you have and the one you want, if anyChange fee charged by the agentNow you've agreed to all that. Why?Note as well that many airlines allow you to change without charge, other than any fare difference, within 24 hours after booking. In the USA you can also get a full refund if you cancel within 24 hours of booking, but none of these 24 hour policies work unless you've booked directly with the airline."
"I can see how the fees might amount to $1000 on a long haul flight. Most of it would probably be the difference in fare between the time of booking and the time of changing the flight.But when the booking was made less than a day ago, I'd be very much wanting to see a breakdown of the fees."
Worst site for booking. There no support.
DO NOT use this service. Very confusing with lots of hidden money making trapsAnd no support serviceOnly care to get more money from you
"Mytrip is real, but they have the worse service ever. if you have any trouble with your tickets - no chance to get money back. I am having this issue now. No money back for intercontinental trip for almost 3 months already! Best"
">> No money back for intercontinental trip for almost 3 months already! <<who cancelled the flight?if the airline, speak to your card company as you have paid for something you have not and will not receive.if you cancelled the flight you need to refer to the fare rules of the ticket regarding refunds. The vast majority of tickets sold by third parties are non-refundable so any refund would be some government taxes...less mytrip fees...which may leave nothing to be returned to you. Has the airline confirmed if they have issued a refund to mytrip? (they will only pass on what they get back from the airline less their fees, after they have received it)"
I felt so cheated when they refunded my 6 tix with airline n I did not get back a penny. Impossible to get them when u needed to
"What was the reason your tickets were cancelled, did the airline cancel or did you cancel? What were the fare rules of your tickets, did they allow a refund if it was you who cancelled them?"
"I would recommend going straight with the airline, I had to deal with them and highly unprofessional and unhelpful. The guy had a thick accent I could not understand as I think they have their call centers in India and when I asked specific questions, he kept on rumbling around and around without providing specific answers. Their costumer service requires hours of waiting and you will end up paying so much more for the ticket you are better paying more from the beginning and avoiding the hassle"
"It is impossible to make contact with MyTrip after a booking has been made and paid for. I asked for an email address for Customer Services and this is the response I got............ ""OK. Got it. I'm sending you to a secure page to join JustAnswer for only CA$5 (fully-refundable). While you're filling out that form, I'll tell the Email Technician about your situation and then connect you two.Continue >>"" Such a scam!!!"

I used it recently. They changed our flight plan few days before leaving. The assistance is ZERO
Its a fraud i payed for my flight i had no problem going to my destination but they never booked the return flight i had to buy another flight the get back home now they just ignore me worst customer service they just steal your money
"Hi guys, we are having the exact same issue and have requested recordings and a name change as we recently married.How do we get them to action this as we have spent 209 aud on calls and my trip have lied to us saying Malaysian airlines haven't actuined anything it's all building. How do we get help on this matter is there an aviation protection line or a number I can call we fly out in 1 week"
">> a name change as we recently married <<it is fine to travel on maiden name as long as this matches passport. Flights should be booked as name on passport...if you did that, don't change the name / get new passport until after the trip.Malaysian Airlines website says they do not allow name changes."
"There is no way to force them to do anything as far as I;m aware. You have to persist with My Trip, and hope that if necessary the airline will assist once they take control of the ticket.As you've probably realised, if had booked directly the airline could have assisted you already."
"Hello, I suggest you do not use this compagny very bad services i lost 640 euros in france"
"Booking through the system was okay but everything else was terrible. 1. At the airport, I had to beg the airline to book my bags the whole way through to my final destination. The airline was super helpful and the only reason I got my bags at the end. The way MyTrip had booked the flights confused everyone I spoke to. 2. They didn't issue me the boarding pass via email and when I called, said that they would never be able to do this (despite having already issued one for a different flight). They didn't even know which airline i was flying with!! They told me it was Turkish Airlines but it was Thai airlines! The ladies at the counter helped me, MyTrip was ZERO help and very frustrating!!! If the ladies at Thai Airlines didn't help me, I would have missed my connecting flight in Sydney which, after flying 20+ hours would have been miserable.Im from Ireland and live in NZ so I'm very used to doing long haul flights and usually book through travel agents like MyTrip but this was one of the worst experiences I've had. If it wasn't for the awesome people working in the airlines, I'd still be in Istanbul!"
"Just trying to book flights to oz. Booked seats at extra charge. Plenty available.put in my credit card details, 1 flight fully booked.book another flight, no thanks."
"It's legit, as in if you book and pay you will get a real ticket, but their support is so bad that you are better off booking direct. Additionally, they are not completely honest with their customer support. I booked a ticket that I ended up having to cancel. When I called them, they said no cancellation, completely non-refundable. (I know on their website, it says that their refund /cancellation policy depends on the airline, and I know that Qatar lets you cancel.) After that call, I called directly to Qatar airlines and explained that I needed to cancel, and indeed they do allow it, and the cancellation fee is only a small amount. I called again to My Trip and told them Qatar says it is refundable, after which they begrudgingly agreed."
"I booked Air France flight dated 11th April from Delhi to Tallinn via Paris. I was not aware of the fact that the flight was actually operated by Jet Airways. After reaching to airport, I got the notification that flight was cancelled, just 3-4 hours before departure. There was no alternative arrangements offered. I had to book another expensive flight to Frankfurt immediately as my plans were urgent then. . it's about 6 months passed several dozen attempts and dozens of calls later, I am yet to be compensated. Never trust or book through mytrip.com ever. They're frauds."
"""I am yet to be compensated""---Don't hold your breath as MyTrip or the airline can't refund you, unless you paid by Credit Card then your card provider might be able to help."
">> I am yet to be compensated. <<don't waste your time with mytrip as they are not going to be able to get any refund from JetIt is unfortunate you didn't notice the ""operated by"" notice or checked in online in advanceSpeak to your credit card company and/or your travel insurancefollow the information on the Jet website www.jetairways.com/insolvencyproceedings/"
"Your card provider or your travel insurance provider are the only pathways to getting a refund when an airline goes out of business, as I believe is the case with Jet Airways. In this case, the booking site is not to blame."
Mytrip.com cancelled my ticket by mistake 3 days before my trip. I asked for a refund of the handling charge and compensation on extra cost I paid to buy another ticket immediately. They asked me to wait and I hear nothing even my trip was over! Shame on them!
They are scammer. Be careful.
"WORST Agency, never trust this agency they are a fraud!!’nn"
Terrible page. Just trying to get money off you. Doesn’t work. Not checked in/boarding card available despite paying extra for it.
"Used a few times,all went well......sorry to upset all those on here with one post to their eternal credit........just proves that a Wonky using a Shonky...is not a good combo...."
Please do not book on Mytrip. Terrible service. Expensive service packages wich are a fraud. Be warned.
"Yes and No. if you use them, you can only hope that you do not have any problems along the way because their costumer service department is nothing less than junk. In my case they failed to uphold the policy of the airline itself so I am very cautious before I book a flight now. In addition, they are very rude and straight up lie to you in tour face not too mention the hour long line wait when contacting their costumer service office. I have tried Justfly.com and they seem to be ok but honestly, I highly not recommend this site."
"Yes, that’s what they do with their vagueness. Your best bet is to call them directly to try to find out."
"Gurugram, Haryana, India is where they are based in. Not sure why sometime the information found online about their location states Greece."
"From the T&C's:"" Mytrip.com is owned by e-Travel S.A. - an IATA certified Online Travel Agency. e-Travel S.A. was established in 2007 and is registered and located in Athens, Greece.7 Kifisias Ave., Ampelokipoi 115 23, AthensVAT registration number: EL998645900IATA Accreditation number: 2721308-2GNTO Certificate: EOT 0206E60000441100"""
"It seems pretty clear to me that for legal purposes they are based in Greece, though no doubt like many companies they will have outsourced a lot of their operations to India."
Be warned !! MYTRIP charges for canceled flights and does not refund the money!Very poor customer service!
"""MYTRIP charges for canceled flights and does not refund the money!"" Cancelled by whom? The airline or you?"
Confirm with the airline when (if) they have issued the refund to your agent. Mytrip will only refund once they have received the funds from the airline- one of the many disadvantages of not booking direct with airline. Why did you choose them?
@Hadas YPlease stop spamming.
"do not ever use the site. they never refunded money back after 6 months and I have never seen such dodgy company. Looking for place to claim - but since it is not in UK, but somewhere in Greece its more complicated"
">> they never refunded money back after 6 months <<under what basis are you awaiting a refund?if the airline cancelled a flight have they have confirmed when they paid the refund to myTrip?did you contact you card company (paid for something not received)?if you cancelled a reservation then, depending on the fare rules of the ticket you asked them to purchase and their service fees there may not be anything due."
Bad bad please stay away they take your money and ignore you very very bad call centre in india customer service from deepak n aiyush and subagya is just awful customer service once they take your money they don’t want to know you plzzz stay away I would not even give 1 star !!!!!
Terrible customer service. Did not receive my refund after the airline send it to them. DON'T USE THEM!!!
"Dont come any near this online agency! Worst customer service ever who mislead you and dont do what they said they would do! Called them like literally over 10 times! Tried to cancel and get refund for the flight tickets purchased based on misleading information from the airlines. Eventhough the airlines agreed to waive my ticket, mytrip found many reasons or ways to have the tickets expired and wasted. The only thing they needed to do is to contact the airlines regarding my issue but they refused to do so even when i had satisfied everything that they requested for the matter. Plus, every operator gives you different information to mislead you. Some of them were quite arrogant! Never ever use this agency!Their phone number was +442079432838. Bunch of indians who are just trying to fool you"
"Shocking service, they changed my flight last minute, were hugely rude and unhelpful and I had to re book my own flight and pay double as they wouldn’t assist with a refund. Use this company at your own risk......."
"Terrible agency, I do not recommend. We used them to book a trip and paid for the trip insurance. Our flight was delayed, making our connection and return flight impossible. They said since it was two desperate bookings there was nothing they could do. They actually told us to use the return flight even though we couldn't get to our destination. Really?! Ridiculous. They also had a lot of hidden fees and up-charged more than you get booking through the airlines directly."
"Avoid at all costs. People on the phone don’t know anything, you will get different information depending on who you talk to. 30min after I booked a flight (THAT COST ME £800), I got an information about time change and now mytrip would not issue me ticket because not enough time for transfers. They wouldnt even change the booking. Only option was waiting 10 days for refund. I am flying out soon and I am stuck now."
">> 30min after I booked a flight <<bookings with third parties involve 2 stepsstep 1 - you make a booking request. They put a hold on the funds and then (usually within 24-48 hours) check if they can fulfil your requeststep 2 - they fulfil your request and you receive confirmation of booking or they cannot (as in your case)when they cannot the hold will drop off your card in a few daysFor travelling soon you cannot afford to mess about with third parties without live pricing,...should go direct to the airline website. Was there a specific reason you chose MyTrip instead of the airline?"

"Yes, it's much better to book directly with the airline. Regular contributors here advise this all the time. It's a shame you had to find out the hard way."
I have used them and they are s**t. I would not recommend this to anyone they have scammed me out of an extra £1000 just to change travel dates. Customer service is crap too and rude. Will not be using them again I would rather pay the extra to get a better service
>> scammed me out of an extra £1000 just to change travel dates. <<possibly not...what were the fare airline rules of the flight ticket you asked them to purchase? This would likely be a change fee of £x plus the fare difference..the cheaper the fare type the higher the change fees. These fees apply whether you book that ticket type with the airline or with a third party...the mytrip service fee will be a very small % of this overall cost
"Great costumer service! The airline (Tap) canceled the flight (operated by Emirates that is still flying ??) and the ONLY flight option from Mytrip will arrive 30.5 Hours!!!!!! 30.5 hours later!!!!!!!!!!!! 30.5 hours later!!!!!!!!!!! Or they can give a refund, and the equivalent flight now (original bought a while ago) costs additional 300 Euro. Called the costumer service, after 40 minutes!!!!!, 40 MINUTES!!!!! i was not able to talk to Rahul's supervisor, that was busy in another call!!!! 40 minutes calling from overseas, on me... I guess (just guess) that the supervisor doesn't want to deal with the problem....40 Minutes!!!!!!!! Rahul even told me to call TAP!!!?!?!?! I bought the ticket from Mytrip and they told me to call TAP!!!? Really great costumer service!!!! Amazing company!!! If you like adventures, even before you leave home to your vacation destination, just buy a plane ticket from them, got me sweeting in no time (just 40 minutes)"
So why did you choose them? Your complaint is not the first to be made. There are hundreds of them on here. Shouting at us doesn’t change things.
was there a reason that you did not purchase the ticket direct from TAP?
You can't expect decent customer service from any third party ticket flogger. My advice is to avoid them all in future and book with the airline instead.
"I bought ticket through from mytrip with correctly key in my baby name. But when I checked the travel documents they sent to me which short of 1 words. I checked with the airlines company whether there will be any issue arise, they said it will cause unable to boarding. So, I call them to amend it but they give me an excuse said that my baby name is too long which cannot be enter all of his name. Actually my own name is longer than my baby's name. What a stupid excuse given. The customer service operator not solving my problem and yet still ask me to purchase their extra service and send me the link for payment. End up i got no choice just re-purchased my kid ticket through the airlines company and cancelled the ticket booked from them. Then I called back to ask for refund, they give me an excuse said that airline company not yet cancel. I have wasting a lot of time to solving this issue. In the end, airline company which are the one help me to settle down and the airline company customer service told me that if mytrip willing help it just an easy process.DON'T USED THIS AGENCY, THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY WHEN PROBLEM ARISE"
"I tried using this site on november 26th 2019, to book flights for my family of 4, everything looked and felt right until got to payment options, put all my credit card information than site said booking and payment not confirmed. Got worried and looked up my account , and noticed the full amount had been charged to my credit card and transaction was on hold. informed my bank immediately and cancelled cards and lodged a disputes with credit card company eventually hold on the transaction was removed by nz. my trip .com but it took a week for money to return into my account."
"This is how many online ticket flogging sites work. They don't have live pricing, and technically you don't book anything, you make a booking request. In other words, you ask them to get you a ticket at the price you saw. They put a hold on your funds to make sure you have the means to pay, then they try and get you a ticket.If they fail, then they ask you to pay more or make up some silly excuse as to why your booking can't be completed."
"I can see why you'd think that, but nope - just wanted to give a positive review as I was expecting much worse from the other comments!"
"I was sceptical about mytrip.com after I read the reviews here but I booked before checking here. I was really worried that they would change or cancel my dates so I called the airline and they said that the ticket is legit.I have to say I won’t book with this website as I was worried.BUT, everything went well I got the tickets and my suitcase arrived at the right place. No problems at all and check in was simple and smooth. But to not run into any other issues people have had here I would always book directly with airline."
"I got had today :( looked legit but after paying there was a 'delay' in confirming my booking and when it eventually arrived the departure flight had mysteriously changed to a cheaper one 11 hours earlier leaving in the early hours. Tried to email them. Couldn't find an address or any sort of help function. I'll be spending tomorrow dealing with their call centre which based on other reviews, will be a terrible experience and likely waste of time. Stressful!"
"They suck. They told me they booked my seat selection and waited several days to tell me that, whoops, they didn't book my seats and I would have to do it myself. They neglected to tell me that since they did the original booking, I could not book seats on line but would have to book over the phone which cost 2 1/2 times as much. They also charged me for bullsh*t extras like ""premium support"" which, as far as I can tell, means nothing but them taking my money (non refundable, of course). Do yourself a favor and avoid them."
oh dear. How can these guys operate?
Never ever use them!!! They have the worst customer service..... so rude. Needed to change a flight! Let me book online for minors travelling alone
"Do not trust them at all. They are cheaters, thieves. They only lie and lie and lie and lie."
Better not to book with this site they charge more than i expected. Much better to book with the airline straight because sometimes they have promo and less charge.
MYtrip is a Fraud better not to book with this site. Does anybody know where or how to make a formal complain to shut down this Fraud?
Well the best way to close down auseless company is for people to check them out before handing their money over and then deciding not go use them.Who do you expect to monitor their activities and close them down?
#525 PFart.......you could try giving us some actual facts....
"Facts would be good. But if you are convinced this is fraud, the local police where they are based would be a good place to start, I'd have thought."
Thanks a lot. The discussion here has saved me.
very bad experience they charged my credit card without showing transaction fees.they have hidden chargesPlease do not book ticket with them.
"Highly highly recommend AGAINST using mytrip.com. Best case scenario: extreme frustration and paying more than you expected for the flights. Worst case scenario: You will be scammed out of your money and have a hell of a time trying to get a refund from them. Really, it is not worth it, book with someone else, please."
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to buck the trend. Whilst I have no doubt that many have had problems, my experience has been the opposite. My niece was booked on a flight from Vienna to Cartagena in Colombia, but Air Canada informed her of a change in timing of the final leg, making the final connection impossible. Having read through the reviews I thought that any attempts to remedy the situation would be in vain, but I got through to an operator immediately who rebooked the whole flight sequence with a better connection as well, and at no extra cost.On the other hand, I used Kiwi last year - they are based in Brno and it was out of loyalty to a friend of mine who works there - and whilst there were no problems with the flights and all went smoothly, I didn't like the fact that you give them complete control over everything so I would avoid them in the future, especially if using budget airlines. I'm preaching to the converted, but with them it is of course always best to go direct."

Have you nothing else to add to your insightful post Michael?
"Used them for a domestic trip in Australia this week and had no problems at all. Since they obviously bulk buy, you should make sure you know exactly what you are booking and should be fine. I'd be more than happy to use them again. Reading reviews after buying my tickets made me very worried something would go wrong, but it all went flawlessly (at least for me)."
"""they obviously bulk buy""Nope. They wait for a booking request to be made then try to buy the ticket for the punter at the price they had advertised it for."
"“ Since they obviously bulk buy”—-Go on then, do explain how that works. Do they just buy large amounts of seats on every flight possible then? Sounds like a great business model."
"Yes, Wendy, please explain exactly how they operate because what you say is obvious is anything but obvious to me.The truth is that even the worst booking sites are going to get things right more often than they get it wrong. So if you know what you're doing, are happy to make a booking request, wait while they try and find you a flight, don't have to change anything later or contact them for any reason, then you have a good chance of not encountering any issues at all.You will, however, expose yourself to a greater risk of problems than if you book direct."
No - they are not legit - they are just the worst of the worst I have ever seen in my life regarding managing flights and customer service.
"I booked with them. Long story short they issued a dodgy ticket (suspended ticket). My husband was denied boarding, and we had to pay for a new ticket ourselves (Australia to West Africa- not cheap!).3 months later and they are still blaming the airline, airline blaming them, so we haven’t received a refund."
"Another one bites the dust... Is a long thread here but they continue the same way.Skyscanner > trip.com , asked for one reservation OTP-IAD and back.Was sold 2 reservations instead of one I requested (without any kind of explanations except a fine print), one from OTP to FRA and another one from FRA to IAD. Second one with no luggage allowance. Even if I will pay for the luggage fee have to transfer the bag myself in FRA,Trip.com did blame me for not reading the fine print and no refund.Be aware, Lufthansa has now international flights with no luggage allowance (how low can they go?) and Trip.com is as miserable as usual so stay away from them. This was new to me, each new reservation is a source of new excitement these days. Happy travel!Edited: 11:12 am, January 20, 2020 "
"""This was new to me, each new reservation is a source of new excitement these days.""I book without excitement directly with the airline.On the website of Lufthansa it is made absolutely clear what ""Economy light"" includes / means: no change of date, no cancellation refund and no hold luggage.The problem is therefore rather Mytrip than Lufthansa."" international flights with no luggage allowance (how low can they go?)"" They have this for a while. And to be fair, I like it, as I travel frequently with hand luggage only.De-bundling in economy makes booking a bit more complicated, but on the other side you only pay for the services you need and/or seem worth the money. De-bundling was a reaction to low cost carriers, which started the game of de-bundling."
"#541'Skyscanner > trip.com , asked for one reservation OTP-IAD and back.'Dubai_Phil_R has just given a good response to your post........but on the above point you did a search on Skyscanner....and I assume the cheapest result you jumped at has 'self transfer' listed with your chosen option....or you went to a mytrip link from there,and somehow chose a different flight on their search results generated from the skyscanner referral....I see these things all the time,and as is blatantly obvious from your post you do not have the slightest clue how airfares work....made assumptions that the cheapest fare would have all the same benefits of a full flexi fare ticket......we see people like you here all the time....newbies with mouth and attitude...making fools of themselves in front of experienced travellers...."
">>>Be aware, Lufthansa has now international flights with no luggage allowance (how low can they go?)<<<I'm a big fan of debundling, as it allows me to choose what I want to pay for and what I don't want to pay for, rather than having everything bundled in whether I want it or not.As for using this MyTrip company, I can't understand why you chose to do that if you already knew they were miserable."
Recommending not to book through them- they cancelled our flight a couple of weeks ago- and still didn't find a new one!!!!
Only an airline can cancel a flight. They can cancel your booking request though
"I bought a ticket from mytrip.com (ref'd by skyscanner site). I bought my wife a ticket Tampa to Cebu, Philippines. During my wife's visit the Chinese Corona Virus broke out. I called mytrip.com and they said I should call the airline to get them to make a note if they will refund or reroute do to the circumstance. I called Cathay Pacific yesterday (90 min wait) and they said that Philippines passport holders (my wife) can't board a flight to Hong Kong (her layover) anyway and the 2nd part of her ticket will be refunded and no fees.And they will make a note. I called mytrip 3 times (2 30 min waits then disconnected then finally a 30 min wait that turned into a conversation with a rep in a (heavy accent) India call center who can't see the note. I went ape s*** and said that I'd call the Airline again and they can hold with me. So I dialed on my desk phone and sat 40 min waiting for them to pick up at Cathay. Miraculously the mytrip person spoke up and said behind the scenes she called Cathay (waited 'til now, why???) and they said they need my wife's passport and green card and all will be fine. So, I uploaded it while we were on the call and asked ""are we good? I can forget it and I will see a refund?"" and she said ""no you need to verify that it's all ok (call tomorrow!!) otherwise you will be a ""no show"" and lose everything. So i called the airline this morning (1:15 wait) and they were appalled that mytrip asked for a passport as 4 days ago they announced and it's on the site that regardless of nationality people destined for Hong Kong can cancel for refund or reroute no restrictions and no fees due to the virus. I said GREAT but can i have a ref # since mytrip couldn't see your OK for refund from the first call? And she gave it to me. I called mytrip back with this code and also sent a screen shot of the airline website showing the special cancel/ reroute/ no penalty policy and the Indian said....""we need to use normal rules....non refundable ticket, etc. I went ape s*** again asked why upload the passport and green card and can you just open your eyes and read the airline's site??? Or call them now? ""Give me a manager please"" ""Ok but they need 24 hours to call you back"" I bought my wife a back up ticket last night (DIRECT FROM AIRLINE) which i have until 9 tonight to cancel. I said ""NO I'LL WAIT) and he put me on hold. 10 min later he came back on and spoke to the manager and they will refund me and sent me an email to that affect. Yesterday 5.5 hours on call (mainly hold, disconnected 2 times) Today 3 hours. Did I win? I think missed work cost me more than the refund but I was in too deep! NEVER AGAIN. If you book with them GOD HELP YOU if you get into a jam that takes a person who can guide, help or pretend to care."
"the warnings are there, adding a middleman will always add complexity, Book direct with the airline if you want to avoid this in the future>> (ref'd by skyscanner site) <<skyscanner showed you a listthe airline would also have been on that listyou chose who to book with from the selection shown - was mytrip showing the cheapest advert?"
"#547 - JeffThe whole thing in Asia is a mess with the virus....I have a friend in Cebu...would have booked myself but for the mess over there this month.You booked with an OTA,via the search engine Skyscanner...they have ratings of OTAs....Mytrip is 3.5/5....not the least,but certainly not the best....and as pointed out by the very knowledgeable Carol G above you decided to avoid booking direct....not a sensible idea,especially now.At least you should now be aware of the benefits of booking direct."
"Your weren't referred by Skyscanner, Jeff. You used it to look for flights and made a choice as to which of the results you wanted to follow up.Next time, please check out who you're giving your money to before you do so. All of these third party sites have poor customer service at the best of times. During the current situation, poor becomes dismal and appalling due to the increased numbers wanting assistance."
They are cheap but they hide information so please be vary of the facts the quote online. Booked my tickets and found out I’m landing in Bali amidst the coronavirus breakout when I booked a flight to Dubai. No refund offered as they said that the ticket is under the airlines control.... What a waste of money!!
"Stay away from these people.They do not offer cancellation option. Called within 24 hours to cancel and they refused to do anything. Even offered them a penalty fee but and they would not listen. Terrible to deal with. Use Flight Hub, these guys are legit and will do whatever they can to satisfy customers."
"I assume you haven't seen all the complaints about Flighthub, then?The point here is that cancellation options with third parties will be outlined in their T&C's. There is no law anywhere as far as I know that require them to provide a full refund if you decide to cancel within 24 hours."
"It is the worst company ever to book a flight with. They supply no phone number. Every time you send an email it is another person answering your mail. Their links do not work 99% of the time. they change your trip to the worst connection times, like 45 minutes between 2 flights in New York etc. I will definitely not book with them again"
"Do not use them. I booked Air China from Sydney to UK. Flight cancelled due to Corona virus. Air China provided full refund, My Trip charged $600. Book direct with the airline and avoid My Trip at all cost."
"my trip has not refunded my money, they said 2 weeks and its been over 2.5 weeks... all they say is send an email, they are the worst company ive even came across DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM. They will not give you your money back."
"Every day more people join Trip Advisor to warn against booking with third party ticket agents.Warnings are no use at all because people looking for (what they perceive to be) cheap fares, don't do any research.Lizzy did you see any warnings before you booked? Did you look for any? If you had you might not have given your money to mytrip."
Bad company
"WORST Customer Service team ever, you just WAIT HRS on the calls just waiting for them to respond.I waited for 30 minutes four times in a row in one day and 1hr the 5th time as i had to reschedule my flight which they rescheduled on their own.NEVER EVER book from them if you feel you may need to talk to the customer service team in the future..It's the worst team ever...Edited: 2:19 pm, February 24, 2020 "
SCAMMERS if you ask me with the experience I have had.
"We just had a similar hassle with them when trying to rebook a connecting flight when our original flight was cancelled due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak. We were supposed to fly through Hong Kong.Absolutely horrible service, just kept getting transferred and waiting on hold, would not recommend to anyone. In the end, we just hung up without results, rebooking directly through airline. Don't use MyTrip.com, it's a waste of time and money."
"""skyscanner showed you a listthe airline would also have been on that list""Not necessarily. I'm looking at a search result right now and the booking option with the airline itself is missing.Skyscanner has been going downhill recently, especially since they were acquired by Ctrip. Maybe they should reveal their commission from these questionable third-party sites they link to?"
"Don't use this agency. Their customer service is abhorrent. Qatar Airways states that owing to the Coronavirus outbreak I can change my destination free of charge. Mytrip.com deny this, despite it being very plainly advertised on the Qatar Airways website. Mytrip.com want to charge over £1000 per ticket to change. Qatar Airways have said that they will change the flights 96 hours before the flight but I need to make alternative arrangements before that. The worst company that I have ever dealt with."
"it does not matter what Qatar Airways say, because you did not book with them. You appointed Mytrip as your agent and they are the client of the airline, and they also have their own T&C's.Edited: 8:27 am, March 05, 2020 "
MyTrip.com are saying that Qatar Airways are not allowing a change to the destination. This is not true as having spoken to Qatar Airways they are more than happy to do so.
"I repeat, you did not book with Qatar Airways."
"No, I didn't but MyTrip.com are not telling the truth. Qatar Airways say that they will allow the change free of charge. Mytrip.com say that Qatar Airways won't. Qater have asked MyTrip.com to call them but MyTrip.com refuse. My solution is to wait until 96 hours before the flight and ask Qatar Airways to change, as they have promised.I have learnt my lesson - always book with the airline and in the meantime I will recommend never ever using MyTrip.com."
I can support this as I am in my third day of trying to get contact or attempt to contact them.I have called them four time and wasted 15-20min waiting on each call.Last call the rep was not interested in the history just to charge extra for a Flexi ticket rebooking.Hung up on me or lost me but has so far failed to call back.I have emailed three times messaged on Facebook and review blogs but nothing.I firmly believe this is their business model and it makes money for them.
"""it does not matter what Qatar Airways say, because you did not book with them. You appointed Mytrip as your agent and they are the client of the airline, and they also have their own T&C's.""It does matter what Qatar (or any other airline ) says. These OTAs are simply agents/middlemen. At best they are resellers, but only when in the very rare case of selling consolidator fares. And last time I checked, third-party agents cannot change Conditions of Carriage and other airline policies in fact. They can add their own extra fees and procedures for changing/issuing tickets, but that's about it. So for example, if Qatar cancels a flight, the OTA would also be obligated to cancel the ticket and refund the money."
I am in agreement with you EliasNYC. I would totally understand if MyTrip.com told me that they needed to charge an administration fee to amend my booking but to say that the airline won't permit an amendment is untrue. I have also noticed that all messages posted on their Facebook page get deleted very quickly. Does anyone know if they have a twitter address please.
"Do NOT use this “Travel Agent”!!! We booked a flight from Minneapolis to JFK to Milan through MyTrip. Shortly after booking, we learned that AirItaly went bankrupt. Here is our dilemma: Air Italy says to request a refund from your travel agent (MyTrip). MyTrip (after sitting on hold for an hour, then arguing with a Support agent, then asking for a supervisor and being turned down), says that we have to request the refund from the airlines.One of these two companies has our $3838 - how do we get a refund?? I think we are probably out of luck, but I will shout this from the highest mountain:<<< DO NOT USE MYTRIP.COM - EVER!!!>>>"
"I booked a ticket from Tokyo to Busan. Airline career(Air Busan) cancelled the flight and announced that tickets will be refunded. And 20 days later there is no reply to my queries from Mytrip, and I cannot reach them with the phone either (the phone rings when I call from a different number). So looks like they blocked my number. Very immoral company. Stay away from them."
"I very much doubt they’ve got the time or resources fo bother blocking individual customers from contacting them. They’re overwhelmed, can’t cope with the massive increase in people trying to contact them.You’ll just need to be patient and if you’re lucky, they will eventually get your refund for you, deduct their fee and pass it on to you.Depending on the ticket price and their fee (which you agreed to) there may not be much to return anyway."
"It is super simple to block a number, and I am pretty sure that is what is happening. 5 calls from my number, disconnects without a single ring each time. A single call from another number, and connects instantly. How else can you explain this? I just sent 2 mails before (asking for a refund), and called and waited on the line for 20 minutes once (before my second mail), which they didn't pick. The mails were completely normal mails. No reason for them to block me. Other than the fact that they are IMMORAL. Anyway, thanks for the reply. I can't believe they are ripping people off like this."
"This is a garbage company that doesn't care about customers. They do not follow information in regards to the airlines when regulations have changed. They will not do any actual research to help resolve issues, especially when there is a pandemic. They are lazy and incompetent. DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIS COMPANY!"
"I think AmoMondo is right about calls not being blocked. It's far more likely that the system is in meltdown due to how quickly things are changing and the very high numbers of people trying to contact agents and booking sites at present.I agree that they are a garbage company but this is an unprecedented situation, and the result is bound to be that even the better companies are overwhelmed. When you have unmotivated and poorly trained/paid staff in the equation as well, then it should be no surprise that it's difficult to get anywhere."
"They are a scam DO NOT BOOK ,!,,"
Dont book with them!!!They completely piss off their clients.They not refound you money even if you have right.They dont answer for any emailsYou will never call you to them.AVOID!!!!!
"They are crooks. They have made off with the money I gave them for a ticket from Mustcat to Istanbul with never so much as a booking confirmation, no record of my booking on their website, and no way of contacting them."
"booking ref :IEADJV(KM), KURD47(SN). I paid about 12 600 krone ,$ 60 of them are for us to get in touch if something happens. The first thing mytrip have done when there was chaos at the airports is to be unavailable. the phone number in Norway does not work, their phone number in Hellas also does not work, well done. you are very smart. bravo you guys have been fooling me.You are not a seriose travel agency.You should be ashamed, it smells MAFIA out of your behavior. I do not recommend you, neither anyone else in your industry. when something happens you become inaccessible and you do not take responsibility, after all the ADD ON we pay for, you suddenly become a mediator and have no responsibility for what has happened. My advice to all of you is book directly from airline or hotel.I have been looking for a link in mytrip's website for 40mn to send a complaint and to get my money back without success.You will not be allowed to run mytrip in this way if you were operate it from Norway. I hope the authorities in Europe somewhere will react, Especially when the customer does not find a form to complaint to get money back.Edited: 11:57 am, March 22, 2020 "
Why dont you do a chargeback with the Credit Card Company?
"Does anyone has their phone number???Thank you in advance.Edited: 12:35 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"Surprisingly, there is a whole raft of numbers on their website.https:/…local-telephone-numbers"
These numbers do not work. They are blocked.
See answer 582 then.
Because the credit card company will ask you to contact mytrip first to find a solution

"ESTAFADORES. No compréis nada con My Trip!! Nosotras buscamos un vuelo a Cancún desde Berlín, al hacer la compra no nos dimos cuenta que era a través de My trip (mea culpa) pero llevabamos muchas horas buscando alternativas a nuestro viaje original (Filipinas) que tuvimos que cambiar a causa del COVID- 19.Para hacer el Check-in nos cobraron 15€. Al transferir los 15€ no nos dejaron seguir trabajando el Check-in (no nos dejaban seleccionar asientos por ejemplo). Enviamos un Mail y nos contestaron que calculaban que la respuesta seria en 1 semana; a la semana nos enviaron otro email donde ponía que no lo habían conseguido trabajar y que ' el caso' estaba cerrado.Todo esto es solo el principio, el problema llega cuando nos envían de la compañía aérea un email donde comunicaban el cambio de horario de uno de los vuelos; con este horario tendríamos un tiempo de tránsito muy limitado en el aeropuerto de Frankfurt. Llamamos a la compañía (Air Canada) y nos dijeron que había otras opciones, como volar por Zúrich, pero que no nos lo podían tramitar porque la reserva era a través de My Trip. Eso fue un viernes por la noche y el vuelo salía el lunes siguiente a las 7 de la mañana. Empezamos a llamar esa misma noche a todos los teléfonos de My Trip, en todos los idiomas que manejábamos (inglés, español y alemán) Horas y horas de llamadas en espera, y cuando al fin alguien contestaba al teléfonos nos decían que habían realizado los cambios y que enseguida recibiríamos un email con la confirmación. Email que jamás llegaba... y vuelta a empezar. Al final el domingo conseguimos que Air Canada nos lo arreglara y llegamos finalmente a nuestro destino.NO CONTRATEIS NADA CON MY TRIP"
"I booked a ticket through this website for a flight which was cancelled. I haven't been informed neither by mytrip nor the airline about cancellation. Furthermore as the flight is inside the EU I should get a refund but the airline decided to offer only rebooking or voucher in the value of the ticket.Now the airline claims that I should contact Mytrip and Mytrip claims the opposite adding that I should cancel my non-refundable booking for a flight which has already been cancelled. What should I do and legally, who is responsible for providing me refund voucher."
"The contract you have is with the agency, in this case MyTrip. As I understand it they are the ones responsible for refunds."
"True but what is confusing me is that it is not refund of money yet a refund of voucher which can be used for flights with particular airline. I called the airline earlier today and they told me that mytrip is responsible for voucher and that they (mytrip) should contact their (airlines) Agent support desk if they have any doubts. I forwarded their reply to mytrip but they still claim that I have a non-refundable ticket (for a cancelled flight) and they can do nothing about it but cancel my reservation and not provide any refund.The airline also offered me rebooking which can be done by the airline themselves without involving mytrip (with me paying the difference in price) but at this moment it is uncertain when will I be able to travel.Edited: 12:40 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"Exactly.Not sure why you chose to give your money to Mytrip. As you can tell from this 4 year old thread, they are hard to work with under good conditions. Under this crisis you can only cross your fingers and pray."
Usually I book directly with airline but this time it was significantly cheaper and I had a discount code. I used such sites before on several occasions and never experienced problems. However there is a first time for everything so lets see how it turns.
"We have a very similar situation, we booked tickets at myTrip.de (from Germany) for flights with Croatian Airlines (from Zurich to Dubrovnik). The flights were totally cancelled. The Croatian Airline offers a refund voucher, which should be valid for the next year. However, since we booked the tickets at myTrip.de, the airline company cannot give us the voucher but sends us to the myTrip to get the voucher. The airline company also says that they cannot contact myTrip, but myTrip should write them at offline@croatianairlines.hrHere, where the all problems just begin. myTrip (or known also under the name e-travel group) has been hard to contact and talk with. We got the phone number from the airline company to contact myTrip (e-travel) 0046 1847 47477 (we were calling from Germany).But myTrip.de does not know anything about the Croatian airline's policy (or does not want to know) and refuses to issue the voucher. They keep saying that they are not informed about the policy of the airline company. They can only change the ticket date, which is not possible since the flights between Zurich and Dubrovnik are cancelled, and it is not known when they will actually start to operate.myTrip representatives even do not want to contact the official representatives of the airline to figure out the current situation, and just keep denying that it's possible.We understand it's a difficult situation, but the most annoying part is how myTrip tries to sneak out of the situation, arguing that they do not know what to do and we should directly ask our airline company for the voucher.Edited: 10:17 am, March 30, 2020 "
My flights are also with Croatia Airlines. At Croatia Airlines they told me that mytrip should provide vouchers.However I also contacted Croatian civil aviation agency and they told me to complain to Croatia airlines for not providing a refund of money and then if they still refuse it to submit a complaint.
Stay away from MyTrup.com!Airline CANCELLED my flight due to the Covid-19 situation and MyTrip want to CHARGE ME to whether have a refund or changing the dates.They should be ashamed to try to make money out of the people affected by a global PANDEMIC - no ethics or respect for customers.
You agreed to these fees when you chose to book with a third party and not directly with the airlineYou need them to work with the airline and process the refund for you so are entitled to be paid for this work at the agreed rateThey are not a charity and need to pay their staff to do the work. (whether you like the fee or not is a decision to make before you accept)The situation is not your fault but it is also not their faultYou can avoid third party fees when you book direct with the airline.
"Thank You miss obviousMy problem with mytrip is that they are refusing to offer all the options provided by Airline. They only offer re-booking. I would not mind paying the fee if the case is being handled properly and if they show at least a small part of understanding as customers are showing to them with not-functioning phones and endless waiting for reply even with following their advice about not contacting them if the flight is not departing within the next 6 days.I am dealing with several cancellations caused by covid situation and mytrip is by furthest the worst. I understand the lack of flexibility and difficulties in communication but mytrip is showing complete ignorance. And of course they didn't even informed me about flight cancellation.They are not a charity but neither are us the passengers. We paid them to get some level of service not to sponsor their employees. So once and if this thing will be over people will need to fly but general demand will be reduced. I will personally never book with mytrip again.Edited: 1:20 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"You paid them to get a cheaper ticket on an airline than you could directly. Not to have them arrange things for you. They make up the difference in the fees they charge, fees you agreed to when you clicked the ""I agree to the Terms and Conditions"".Nearly 600 posts on this company. They stink in good conditions, I would be surprised if they emerge from the other end of this pandemic. You've been a member here for over a decade. You know how to research travel and yet you gave these losers your money.If they offer you a voucher I would grab it and use it ASAP while you still have that option. Or initiate a credit card chargeback.Edited: 3:02 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"'And of course they didn't even informed me about flight cancellation.' For two reasons, the first that wretched mytrip.com are the airline's customer - the carrier would have informed their customer of any changes. That they didn't pass on the message isn't surprising.The second is that mytrip.com are a ticket flogger with minimal customer care at the best of times, and now they are out of their depth and have little interest or ability in trying to keep up with the rapidly changing situation.It's true that ticket floggers will charge fees for whatever they can as otherwise they'd not be in business. Agreeing to their terms without reading them is a matter for those who think they've found 'cheap' fares.One way to ensure that mytrip.com won't be in business in a year's time is to stop using their [lack of] services. Without income they should disappear."
"Ante, you seem to be under the impression that this company is some kind of travel agent, offering a full range of services to it's customers.Here's the news. They are nothing of the sort. They are a business that seeks to make money on selling airline tickets. There are slim to non existent profits in that activity, so they cut their costs to the bone and make their money out of the fees that they charge. To be blunt, you didn't pay them for service, you paid them for what you thought was a cheap flight.They are far from alone in what they do. Whilst covid-19 has led to an unprecedented travel situation, there are plenty of other poor outfits who are doing the same thing, and have been for years. As so many people are now suddenly finding out to their cost."
"""Usually I book directly with airline but this time it was significantly cheaper and I had a discount code.""So if someone online on a nice-looking website was selling a Ferrari for 400 Euros/Dollars/Pounds whatever and said that there was a discount coupon for 100 so it would only cost you 300, and, when you go online you see all sorts of reviews of that website, talking about how their deals are fake, that they don't deliver and are a nightmare to work with, would you just figure ""Hey it's significantly cheaper than I normally would pay and I have a discount code""? I would hope not, because it's pretty obvious that there is something fishy in this deal. But that is precisely what you did here, I'm afraid. There are countless threads warning about this company and others that do similar warning of their poor performance at the best of times. Right now we are really far from ""the best of times"".My hope is that this will cause these companies to go out of business. Unfortunately this would mean that their customers would get nothing back - but I suspect that's what they are going to get back even if they don't go out of business.My fear is that after all this is over, a slew of other new companies with new names and enticing websites will crop up doing exactly the same thing, relying on the fact that there are enough people who won't look further than "" it was significantly cheaper and I had a discount code"" when making their purchase.A very expensive lesson learned for many people... I just hope that he lessons are truly learned, though, and that people will realise that the risk they take on with these shonky companies exposes them to losing all their money. The risk is far smaller when booked directly with airlines.Edited: 4:52 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Well if you start reading reviews for everything from mytrip to Lufthansa first class 80% of what you read is pure horror. By reviews the best would be to ditch airlines, trains, buses, ferries, bikes, car rentals and stay at home or hitchhike and sleep under the sky."
"Avoid this company. We had booked a flight to Canada. Contacted several times the company via email and phone to postpone the trip. According to the reservation policy this was possible. Also the airline confirmed that the trip can be postponed by email. No adequate response till one week before the trip. Received an email saying if you agree that we will receive 50$ administration cost, we will postponed it otherwise you should pay the full charge!!! So basically they forced us to pay for their horrible service. Won’t recommend this company."

If someone knows away to get in touch with them, please tell me. Otherwise, we shouldn't be talking about them as if they are a legitimate company."

Absolute crooks!My flights were cancelled a month ago by air India because of the lockdown situation we are facing and these guys closed all communication lines and ceased operations without contacting their costumers or notify their flights had been cancelled. I only found out I had no flights after I logged in to my booking on the Air India website. No refunds in sight either! I eventually found them under one of their many alias company names on Resolver.com and opened a dispute to which they never responded. Resolver can not locate this company ! Steer clear and avoid them at all costs! I hope the authorities can arrest these people for fraudulent activity.
My flights were cancelled a month ago by air India because of the lockdown situation we are facing and these guys closed all communication lines and ceased operations without contacting their costumers or notify their flights had been cancelled. I only found out I had no flights after I logged in to my booking on the Air India website. No refunds in sight either! I eventually found them under one of their many alias company names on Resolver.com and opened a dispute to which they never responded. Resolver can not locate this company ! Steer clear and avoid them at all costs! I hope the authorities can arrest these people for fraudulent activity.
"Thieves and cheatersNo, MyTrip cannot be trusted!Be very careful!They are professional thieves.Long story short. Avianca refund me, through MyTrip, a flight that I didn´t take, because of a loss in my family I could not take that flight. This was a year ago. April 2019. Until this day MyTrip has not refund me back my money. There is no way to communicate with them personally. No phone, no email, no nothing. I tried facebook, they answered through messenger taking no responsability and blaming my friends Spanish bank (cause they couldn´t refund back to my credit card only to a European bank account, strange huh? I live in Chile.)Well the messenger link now doesn´t exist, it´s broken, how is that possible? It´s beacuse they are real pros, they are criminals and thieves that for sure have done this a million times, so piece of cake for them to cheat! They have a team doing this for them.So yes, don´t trust them. Use other platforms!Maite Awad"
"It's broken now, Maite, because millions of people's flights have been canceled.This is not the time to deal with issues from a year ago. You should have disputed with your credit card company then, if you had a case. Now? Did you notice 600 other complaints already in this thread before you posted?"

I really have a goal of trying to convince folks to NEVER USE THIRD PARTY BOOKING COMPANIES, but when they do, I try to help them the best that I can.Sometimes it's only ""I hope you do well but please research first"" and sometimes I can give more specific info to help someone.After a year, and all the current trouble? You're trying to get blood from a stone.Be well, stay safe, let this one go. Learn from it and move on.

611/613/615That was not necessary.
"Oh blow - I missed it !! Presumably Maite was expecting more sympathy than she got and didn't appreciate the words of wisdom given ! As northern traveller said in Post 614, Maite should have taken it up with her payment provider at the time not waited for several months. The bit about ""blaming"" a friends spanish bank sounds interesting - I wonder where the friends bank came into thingsBTW Maite's TA profile says she lives in Barcelona not Chile"

Fake scammer dont trap your money
That post isn't very informative - without proper detailed information about what happened andwhen it is a pointless thing to say TBH Usman
"Not fake or a scammer, Usman, but if you don't read the terms and conditions AND you expect quality customer service, especially in a pandemic, you could end up unhappy"
SCAMMERS!My advice for anyone trying to get a refund: contact your bank and dispute the transaction - this is the only way to get your money back!
"This was explained to you last time you posted, Ellen. They are not SCAMMERS. They are a terrible company that charges fees when flights get canceled, and YOU agreed to those fees when you gave them your moneyThis thread has been here for FOUR YEARS. You've been a member of TA for 13 years. How did you miss these warnings when you researched this company before you gave them your money?"
they are fraud... dont book ...
"I saw some messages in this forum, when you buy cheap ticket you have to meet the consequences, I'm responding to these people:- They are clearly doing fraud, there is no doubt in it. - I did not know this fact when I searched for cheap ticket to my destination.- Now, I know it, as a citizen I have to be responsible for the society. So I'm sharing my experience with other people. - That's clear at least hundred thousands of people came to reach point, but there is only 626 comments in this page, means many people did not share their experience at least in this portal. - Stop blaming people who bought these tickets, start blaming people who did not share their experiences and yourself as well."
"It's not fraud, mehrdad. It's very limited customer service and pushing the laws to their fullest extent, but hundreds of thousands of travelers have used this company successfully.Too many have had problems, though, which is why no one here would ever recommend anyone but their worst enemy try to use it.Spending that kind of money without doing research, yeah, I blame folks who do that. You wouldn't give a guy on the corner $1000 for a Rollex watch, and you don't give your banking info to some Prince in Nigeria. Why give your money to mytrip when this thread has been here for 4 years? The customer (you) bear some responsibility for not doing research before throwing away your money."
"I'm not blaming myself, thank you. I never book through MyTrip or any other third party ticket selling site.What I do blame people for is not looking into companies to see what their reputation is like before handing their money over. You can't assume that every company is good or reliable, not without getting your hands burnt at least sometimes.Perhaps you can explain where the fraud is?"
"I AM WARNING YOU, DON'T USE THIS COMPANY!! I had flights booked for the 29/03 2019 which were cancelled and I'm still waiting for my refund over a year later!!! They owe my little under £700 and I've had to be the one out of pocket this whole time. I've spoken to multiple members of their incompetent 'customer service team' who won't be able to give you any useful or reassuring information about where your refund is or what their process is to get your refund back to you. On one occasion I asked to speak with a manager and the individual told me that they weren't available but later on in our conversation said 'let me check with my manager'!! They will lie through their teeth and they'll be as vague as possible whilst you're wasting more of your money speaking to them on the phone. On more than three occasions I was told that I would get frequent updates on the status of my refund and to this day I don't think I've had any communication with this company if I've not initiated it. The email replies I've received have all been basically formatted and I've had hardly any human to human correspondence. I believe that this company will do anything to not refund you your money and that they sit there hoping and praying that you'll suddenly forget that they owe you money! Oh and watch out because they'll try to tell you that they won't refund the full amount that you paid either and they won't offer any compensation for any other rearrangements, new transport or for the stress. I will be leaving this review on every platform I can find so that more innocent people don't fall into their trap."
"Thanks, Sammie. This thread has been here for 4 years and over 600 posts warning you away, but your post is going to make a big difference!"
"Well, we tried using MyTrip.com and ended up having a horrible experience. (My own fault for not investigating an reading more reviews!) Here's what is happening to us:I should have known it was too good to be true to be getting such inexpensive airfare, but they seemed legit, so... booked with them. What a god-awful mistake that was! We booked the flight back in January, before the virus situation had really taken hold. We paid our $3800 to MyTrip.com and they booked a flight for us using Air Italy. Unfortunately, 2 weeks later Air Italy went bankrupt. Out of luck, right? So sad for us. But not really, read on...Air Italy's website says they are issuing refunds to customers. ""Work through your travel agent and they will give you a refund."" So, I call MyTrip and after sitting on hold for hours, being kicked off, calling back, rude customer service - I am told ""Nope, you have to call Air Italy because they haven't issued us a Waiver code."" So, back on the phone with Air Italy who says ""nope, your travel agent has to work with us, get the code, then issue you a refund.Back to MyTrip, who tells me the airline is wrong. They have to write ""please issue refund"" in the reservation and they'll give us the money back. I've been back and forth so many times and I even offered to do a conference call, where all 3 of us can talk. Of course, MyTrip person did not go for that.I'm so frustrated and I'm betting I'll never see a penny of that money back! So, I have vowed that I will report this company to BBB in USA and will write a review in every outlet I can find. And I'll do this day after day, week after week.Again - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I wish I would have read all the bad reviews, but unfortunately I did not.Good luck and did I mention that YOU SHOULD NOT USE MYTRIP.COM - EVER!!!!!"
"Tell your friends, Rich, cuz they aren’t going to look here, just like you"
Stay away! My flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 and they declined to refund me.
"Covid-19 rebookingI have booked tickets for departure on 13th of May and return trip on 16th of May.Ticket owner (flights operator) is Croatia Airlines. I have checked and due to Covid-19 they have waiver policy of rebooking/rescheduling the flights that are before 31st of May for free for some other days. So I asked mytrip to rebook it for me, the exact same flights but with different dates (October).I got an aswer that I have to pay rebooking fee (price difference) because that's the airline policy.Then I have called Croatia Airlines directly and they have said the rebooking is free and they rebooked it for me immediately without any fee.So beware if they want to trick you too and just call airline that is owner of the ticket. It will save you some nerves and time."
"The price seems low until they have your details, then it goes up.Scaming company won't reply to your emails when your flight gets cancelled, and will not offer the reimbursement the actual flight company offers even though they will tell you they will give you what the flight company offers. Total crooks! Stay clear."
"With all due respect, Putnik, as you have been a member here for over a decade, how are you just figuring this out now? This thread has been here for many years and over 600 posts.WE already know this. You need to tell your friends and other people like you who don't bother doing any research but just throw their money at some sexy fare they see online that they fall for. Post on Facebook, tweet it out."
"NEVER use them. They are a total fraud and you'll talk to nobody but an auto reply machine. My airline cancelled my flight due to corona, and Mytrip.com.au refused any knowledge of this and refused to return my money or offer any kind of credit. The whole process is like banging your head against a brick wall. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS WEBSITE WHATEVER YOU DO."
"Joey: Same as prior post. You have been a member here for a decade. Posting here just adds to the thread and isn't going to stop anyone from using them. If 637 posts aren't enough to convince someone, 638 isn't, too. You need to tell your friends. You need to post on Facebook. You need to Tweet about them. Tell the people, like you, who don't do research not to use them. Otherwise they will keep on ripping folks like you and your friends off."
"Yeah, well what do you think I'm doing? TA comments feed straight into Google SEO and any way to steer the unaware away from MyTrip is better than nothing, isn't it? FYI i have plastered my complaint all over Twitter and FB and, as I said, have my bank pursing them for a non delivered product service. Why are you attacking me? I've done everything I can to warn people against this fraudulent company. I was stupid enough to book with them; I've done all I can; I don't need you horsewhipping me or being naive enough to book with them - the damage is done and so that's of no help at all. Shut up!Edited: 7:53 am, May 09, 2020 "
"Not attacking you, Joey. Trying to direct your anger towards productive means, instead of a rant (for lack of better word) that won't help anyone.Did you google mytrip.com? No. If you had you would have found this thread. Your friends aren't going to google this either, and if they did they would find the original thread. If you want to help ANYBODY you need to reach out to them directly so they don't make the same mistake you made. You say you've done everything you can to warn people about this company, I don't see that you have done anything other than a nice rant here that you got ripped off. And your friends will get ripped off, too. Contact them DIRECTLY and warn them if you want to help anyone. That is the most important thing you can do to warn people. Cut the head off the snake and they die.Good that you are pursuing through your bank. Had you mentioned that before I'd have given you plaudits for doing this."
"So I am going to try one more time, in the hopes that maybe I can get an answer to this question that has been perplexing me for a while.To all those that have been given horrible treatment by this company and are posting here in an effort to warn others to not use them: Would what you have done (posting on this forum) have prevented you from doing this in the first place? If it would have, then why didn't the other hundreds of people posting basically the same thing have stopped you already? If it wouldn't have, then what is the point of posting?There are two possible reasons for someone doing this:1. They did adequate research, saw all the bad stuff that was written about prices not being live (and therefore going up), and shoddy to awful customer service, and decided that it was worth the risk of getting the cheaper prices (risk/reward calculation). If that was the case, then they took the risk, lost, and now need to take the consequences.2. They didn't do adequate research and gave their hard-earned money to a slick looking website with no due diligence. About the equivalent of giving their money to a guy on the street who promises he can get them cheap airfares because he has a nice sign set up.People aren't stupid - and they don't want to just give their money away.So... people who have had these horrible experiences and are posting here - think back to when you booked - what would have made the difference in terms of information of knowledge to make you change your mind?"
"A registered company - MyTrip is a subsidiary of GoToGate and their postal address is listed at the bottom of their website - that successfully books trips at a much lower price. Within hours of booking, I was managing my booking and selecting seats and luggage through the reservation number directly on the Malaysia Airlines website. If it hadn't been for the flight cancellation and subsequent argy bargy, I could see no problem with it. Of course people want to save money - that's why we use websites like MyTrip. And things can go wrong at any time and people can lose their money. But of course people are going to be furious when the latter happens and they're stonewalled by the people/business they paid their money too. Quit with all the philosophizing and moralising and recommendations to do ""research"". Found a cheap deal, booked it, was totally legit up until the COVID cancellation at which point things went very pear shaped. How does one research into the future? If my flight hadn't been cancelled, I'd have no complaint against MyTrip at all."
"In any case, my card chargeback is now fully lodged. I've also raised it with Australian Consumer Rights and shared the story with all relevant Facebook groups (Class Action My Trip is a fun group, one of many)."
"There is no such organisation as ""Australian Consumer Rights""."
"The ACCC, I meant."
"They are “legit” as in they “operate within the law”, but based on the ridiculous number of complaints about them you’d have to be a gambler even in normal times to give them your money. They stink under regular conditions and Gotogate is worse. I expect without COVID and if you had nothing go wrong with your plans like illness, weather, equipment problems, or air traffic delays, using them would likely be ok. But if any of those things happened, and you missed a connection, you’d be quite unlikely to see your money again"
What makes you think that the ACCC has jurisdiction over a company based in Florida?
"""Quit with all the philosophizing and moralising and recommendations to do ""research"".""And with advice like that it's a wonder more people aren't lured in with unrealistically good deals and losing their money. ""research"" is EXACTLY what people should do before giving their hard-earned money to strangers on the internet. It's not moral, it's not philosophy - it's just good sense!""Found a cheap deal, booked it, was totally legit up until the COVID cancellation at which point things went very pear shaped. How does one research into the future? If my flight hadn't been cancelled, I'd have no complaint against MyTrip at all.""In other words, everything went great until it started not going great and then it wasn't.Yes, there are years and years of threads of people who complain about the extremely poor customer service which apparently you didn't research. Hardly surprisingly when the global pandemic hits, their standard of customer service is highly unsatisfactory.It's a very bad situation, and everybody is losing right now. Consequences of poor decisions are coming home to roost..."
"I think it is absolutely hilarious to see all the tongue clucking about ""well, you took the gamble - now it's coming home to roost for you"" etc etc. Fraudulent or duplicitous behaviour by any business, retailer or service provider should never be tolerated. Bear in mind that all the major airlines work in conjunction with sites like MyTrip and Skyscanner and so those sites are hardly illegitimate - your booking through them will be honoured by the airline, fed directly through to it via Amadeus or the equivalent. They - like any business - have no right whatsoever to withhold refunds or not provide credits against services they have sold and now cannot provide. Why are you all making fun of people who are understandably outraged and frustrated at operators who are not providing clear communications and in some cases, denying credits and refunds altogether? And why is it a ""poor decision"" to choose a budget travel site? Not everyone can afford to book directly through the airline and pay a higher price. Since when did having to watch your money become a ""gamble"" and a ""poor decision"". We're not all made out of money, hence the frustration and outrage when we spend what we can afford, the get ripped off.Edited: 10:24 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"""And why is it a ""poor decision"" to choose a budget travel site? Not everyone can afford to book directly through the airline and pay a higher price.""---You seem to be under the impression that all these third party sites have access to magical cheaper fares, when more often than not they don't. In most cases, those cheap advertised fares are no longer available as these sites don't have access to live airline prices.I'm not 'made of money' either, so wouldn't think of handing over my hard earned before doing a little research first. You may be a little more blase about it, which is fine as we're all mature enough to make educated decisions for ourselves."
"This isn't fraud or duplicitous behavior, Joey. It's a mixture of a disregard for customer service and incompetence, neither of which is quite illegal.We're not making fun of you, we are trying to teach you that THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN, and that when you saw a 4 year old thread warning you that this company stinks in good times you should have had a SMH moment and realized that you should have done research before you jumped at a sexy fare.Once you accept that you have a real part of the negligence here, that is when you will start to grow from the experience. A painful lesson for sure, but hopefully you have learned that lesson and will warn your friends so they don't end up here posting similar complaints down the line."
">>>And why is it a ""poor decision"" to choose a budget travel site? Not everyone can afford to book directly through the airline and pay a higher price.<<<This is really the crux of why poor sites continue to operate. Enough consumers are convinced that they offer budget travel even though the reality is that it's rare to save money with them once you consider things such as non live pricing, additional fees, or the time and cost of dealing with them if there are problems.Most of the time, people who use these sites will end up paying a very similar fare to those who book direct, but will pay more in admin fees that they haven't read about. Companies like mytrip.com like to imply that they can undercut the airlines, but can they really? And if they do, how do they do it?The answer is that most of the time they don't undercut, and when there is actually a fare that is slightly less than the airline, they will make up their losses by other means."
"Mytrip is a scam. They don't want to refund for my flight which was cancelled more than 8 weeks ago. It's not that the refund is taking long - they actually haven't even once responded to my 15+ e-mails from the last 8 weeks. They don't respond to phone calls either. Stay away and don't support this shady business!Edited: 12:44 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Don't tell us, Katy. We know. That's why there is a 600 post thread here. Anyone who does a bit of research is going to find this thread and be warned away whether it has 650 posts or 660 postsTell your friends. Post on Facebook. Warn people like you who jump on a cheap fare without doing any research so they don't end up like you did"
"'Mytrip is a scam.' It's not, but it's a lousy operation with minimal customer service at the best of times and even less right now.'They don't want to refund for my flight which was cancelled more than 8 weeks ago.' mytrip.com need to contact the carrier and request the refund, wait for the carrier's response and then return any available funds to you if - a big if - that's within mytrip.com's terms and conditions. They will probably charge a fee for processing the refund, also in their terms and conditions.If their very few staff haven't heard from the carrier there isn't much they can do but wait. What they'll return to you is also unknown as they may offer a credit for future use.Yes, mytrip.com is a miserable website best avoided by everyone, but you asked them to book tickets for you and with that you have to work with their lack of service."
"Actually only just now received an email from them saying they've spoken to the airline and can credit me the full amount of my purchase for future travel. That will have to do. Keep trying, that took me 6 weeks."
Let us know when the money actually arrives!
"One month after my ""episode"" with them, they sent me an e-mail claiming that I can get a voucher and I filled a request and they sent me a voucher. Success. Fun fact: I also used mytrip to book another flight in early March which operated according to schedule and which I actually took and they sent me an e-mail asking me if I want a voucher for that flight as well. LOL,"
"My flight was canceled because of coronavirus on 11 March, Mytripe agency has not been responsible for refund and did not answer my Emails and just one time they answered my call and told me the airline is responsible for refund our change, while the airline says since I booked through a third party( mytrip agency) they are not responsible for change or refund. I will be thankful if someone helps me"
"The airline has to refund MytripThen Mytrip has to refund you.Please note how old this thread is. Mytrip has terrible customer service in normal times. Now with Covid they are overwhelmed. I expect eventually you will get something from them, but it may just be a travel voucher.It depends on the Terms and Conditions of the trip you booked.Next time you plan to travel PLEASE don't use any of these awful online travel agencies. Book direct with the airline so you don't end up like this"
"I must agree, they look like one, no contact information, nothing.do not use mytrip services"
"DO NOT USE their service. I had a flight booked through them which obviously is cancelled by the airline. Now i can reach their call center. If u get connected then they disconnect on purpose. Finally while talking to them, they keep wanting to slap more admin fee and charging for the airline cancellation fee. I have called the airline and gotten in-writing that there is NO cancellation fee.These are scammers. Dodgy as! People with no ethics. Their licence should be revoked. They are stealing money."
"Kush: The airline is not charging a cancellation fee, but MyTrip charges a fee for the time of its staff in handling the refund. You agreed to this fee when you accepted MyTrip's T&C."
"“ I have called the airline and gotten in-writing that there is NO cancellation fee.”—-There may be no airline cancellation fee, but MyTrip May add their own cancellation fees."
">>>I have called the airline and gotten in-writing that there is NO cancellation fee.<<<I'm afraid that doesn't matter, Kush. What does matter is whether the contract you entered into with mytrip provides for them to charge a fee. If you want the terms offered by an airline then book directly with that airline. I hope you remember that in the future. It's a good lesson to take from this."

"Posts 664/5/6 say it all Kush. Your contract is not with the airline - it is with MyTrip and you chose to use them - nobody forced you to. When you booked with them you accepted their full T&Cs . That means that if those mention admin fees for handling cancellations or amendments (as they do) , then that is exactly what you will have to pay - it neither a scam nor theft-, it is simply the terms that you AGREED to abide by initially.Next time it would be wise to read all T&Cs properly before using any online agent, then if you don't like them you can use someone else or better still book flights direct with the airline and cut out the .middleman. Just because you bought tickets from another OTA who has acted more quickly means absolutely nothing - you chose to use a company which is not well known for speedy and efficient customer service at the best of times, so it will take as long as it and in the current pandemic they are naturally going to be overloaded and even slower than usual. The bottom line is that you are currently stuck between a rock and a hard place. If MyTrip chose to ask for their admin fees up front they will do nothing for you until they are paid and even if they go ahead without upfront admin fees they will deduct them from the and the amount you eventually receive will be net of both the initial non refundable booking fee and the further admin charges that you are contracted to pay them for handling the cancellation. The fee scales etc are all covered on their website - terms that like it or not you agreed to when you made the bookingEdited: 6:12 am, May 26, 2020 "
The worst travel agent ever. I rather pay a few dollars more and go with other reliable travel agent.
"And which ""other reliable travel agent"" would that be, Dumb? Kiwi, Travelgenio, CheapOair, Opodo, Travel2be, Hop2, KissandFly, Ovago, Mytrip, Trip, Vayama, Bravofly, eSky, Bugetair, E-Dreams, Makemytrip, Gotogate, Flighthub, Skybooker, Smartfares, Wowfares, Byojet, Travelup etc. Anyone I've missed?"
">>Anyone I've missed?<<Flight Centre? Webjet?Edited: 5:50 am, May 28, 2020 "
"As you can see, DumbFish, there's a lot of truly woeful booking sites about, all of whom attract a lot of complaints here on these forums and elsewhere on the web.That's why I feel it's so important either to book directly with the airlines or undertake diligent and thorough research into who you'll be dealing with before parting with any money.My preference is the first way. It's not a foolproof way to guarantee you won't have issues, but there's a much lower chance in my view. And if you do have a problem it will be quicker and easier to resolve if you don't have a poor third party in between you and the carrier."
Similar to other posts ..flight times changed after booking...now refusing to refund corvid cancellation .Impossible to call.Not sure how but they should be dropped from trading. ...DONT USE
Document your attempts to reach themFile a dispute with your credit card companyTELL YOUR FRIENDS. Posting here isn't going to stop anyone from making the same mistake you made.
"Booked a flight through them, cancelled by the flight company due to Covid, we were supposed to get a refund as per policy, but they never did. Never answered any email, nor phone, they simply disappeared. Don't book through them, spend a little bit more and book directly on the airline's website!"
"You don't necessarily spend a little bit more booking direct. I reckon that mostly the costs will be the same, but additional fees can make booking via a third party more expensive, even if you can manage to save a bit on the actual fare. Think about it. How can a shoddy third party ticket selling site undercut the airline without making up any losses elsewhere? And please don't believe that they can negotiate special cut price deals with airlines because that's not how the likes of mytrip.com work."
"I purchased a return flight to Vancouver through mytrip.com on the 8th March 2020. For a flight out from the UK on the 18th May returning on the 24th May. By the 15th May I had not heard anything from Mytrip regarding the flight, so i had to call them to check if the flight was still going ahead. After calling them and being on hold for 45 minutes. I was told that that the flights were cancelled. I was also told that I would have to rebook the flights for a date prior to the 1st January 2021 and the booking had to be carried out before the flights were meant to take place (18th May) and i would have to pay any difference. In addition to this, they would not privide me with any proof that the flights were in fact cancelled (email, etc) I can imagine that a lot if people are in this situation and it is not fair! My Trip is not delivering on their goods and therefore customers are entitled to a refund.Do not shop through My Trip or their parent company GOTOGATE!! They will let you down and steal your money in times of need"
"What research did you do before you picked this company? Did you see this thread which is 4 years old?By March 8, COVID was a thing everywhere. I can’t imagine booking flights in the short term (two months) at that point in time without making sure that everything was fully refundable.Not sure why you needed email confirmation of the cancelation, but now, weeks later, it is likely you are out of luck whether you used a good company or a bad one for your booking, mytrip and gotogate are horrible, but you’ve made so many mistakes here I don’t see any advice to help fix it other than to do more research next time you are buying something on the internet"
"Laurence,My Trip has no goods to deliver on - they don't own any planes. I don't suppose you do see it as fair nor do the airlines and many others in this situation. I suspect, however, you'll find it is legal and perfectly in keeping with their commercial terms entered into with you.As for the warning at the end - pointless. You didn't listen why should anybody else?Also, a little risky booking international flights on 8 March as things were really kicking off - all the more reason to have checked what you were entering into."
"Laurence, my advice is always to book directly with the airline if you can. It might appear to be more expensive that way, but in the end it can cost you more, sometimes a lot more, to book through an intermediary, especially if they are a very poor outfit. And there are a lot of booking sites that fall into that category, I'm afraid.I also suggest being proactive and keeping an eye on your flights via the airline website, even if you do book direct."
"NEVER BOOK FLIGHT VIA MYTRIP AND SUPERSAVER!!!After 3 months waiting time I finally received the confirmation email for the cancelled flight due to COVID-19. However, I will have to pay 3 handling fee of 13 euros! WTF!!!"
"Do as I say, not as I do, Toki?Edited: 6:57 am, June 10, 2020 "
">>However, I will have to pay 3 handling fee of 13 euros!<<That is a very reasonable handling fee. Some inline agencies are charging $300 US per ticket."

I book a flight and because of covid19 .l had to cancel was supposed to have my refund alm5 months now haven't got it bck yet.All I get is a man telling in 10 days I be refunded then he puts u on hold and never returns it's a big scam
Have you read post 674?
"Worst travel agent ever! Impossible to contact them via email, good luck trying to contact them via phone. You will wait in a queue for an hour and then they will just disconnect you. It's a total scam! You yourself a favour and AVOID!!!"
They have basically the worst customrer support. I regret booking with them.
"So you have tried them all then, have you? Kiwi, TravelGenio, Opodo, eDreams, eSky, etc.?"
"We had a similar situation, we thought mytrip was trustworthy because we were redirected from the site of a friend who has a travel site. He told us that the mytrip is under the umbrella organization of Etraveli Group AB located in Uppsala Sweden. We found their contact info via Google search. www.seat24.se +46-770-457724"
"I would be very wary of this company and certainly not to be trusted with your hard earned cash. We booked flights from UK to Washington DC, due to coronavirus these were cancelled. Contacted MyTrip for refund who want us to contact Virgin Atlantic who THEY booked flights with to get the refund from them. To be fair to Virgin they are as helpful as they can be but are unable to deal direct with us as MyTrip booked the flights with them. Several months later we are still getting the run around and still no refund."
Did you read this thread in your research before giving them your money?
"F**ing scammers :)Just stole money for 12 flight tickets! After 5 months and several email to their support, they replied me:Dear Sir/Madam,We have received a customer support request related to your flight ticket(s), however, our system could not identify and match it with any of the reservations in our database."
You have to do research before you give lots of money to anyone. Especially on the internet
avoid it! they made a massive mess with my booking.
I have got the same email despite the fact that I paste and copy the reservation and the order number. Dirty scammers
"I booked a flight early this year through this bad company then with the pandemic uncertainties, I decided to reschedule the flight. I call them as apparently you need a voucher to rebook it. I was on the phone for 45 mins before finally I got through to someone. Then I got the information that they were not going to give me a voucher but I had to decide which flight to get (strictly with the same airline) and get back to them to book it. So I did, and again after 45 mins on the phone they told me I could have not taken the flight I decide on as it was another airline which was operating for Lufthansa. Then again, I go through the whole excruciating procedure till finally I get to know that there would be an handling charge of £30 to rearrange the flight. Frustrated by the whole poor service I decide I wanted a refund BUT the refund comes with a cost too, £30. I went online filled the form and its over two moths now and I am still waiting to receive my refund. One thing is for sure......Mytrip will NEVER get any booking from me at the cost of paying more some other companies."

"So even though this thread is 4 years old and you've been a member here for 8 years you still gave them your money?WHY???Have you read post 674?Edited: 11:51 am, July 10, 2020 "
"I booked air tickets on the Internet through MyTrip, but due to Covid-19 have to cancel or rebook.There is no email on their Website under ""Contact us"", although it is recommended by them to use their email. The tickets also look very cheap when booking them, but after booking they charge you a whole lot extra for different services which is normally for free through other agencies.I will never book though MyTrip again! Please stay away from them."
"""The tickets also look very cheap when booking them, but after booking they charge you a whole lot extra for different services which is normally for free through other agencies.""---Out of interest, can you clarify which services are provided for free by which other agencies?"
"They are impossible to deal with. The airlines refunded them for our canceled flight, but they refuse to pass the refund onto us. There is no customer service whatsoever."
"SDS,Many words, no information"
SDS: WE know this.700 posts was a clue to us. How come you didn’t know this? How to reach people like you to warn?
"SDS, when you say refused, did they actually tell you this and give a reason? Or is it just that it's been a while and they haven't returned your money yet and you can't contact them?We do need detail if we are to try and assist."

"Dr M,What a delightfully, well constructed and balanced report on your experience, topped off with some very grown up language. Your assertion that 'they cancelled my flight' tells me all I need to know about your knowledge of who you bought a ticket from."
Run a mile is is a conFlight cancelled refund refused as it is supposedly airline policy do not use this site warn your friends
"700 warnings here already Paul. You didn’t listen, why should the next guy?No idea what your first sentence is about"
"It might easily be airline policy, Paul, but only if you cancelled. If the airline cancelled then ask your card provider if they can assist. It will help if you can show them that MyTrip have refused to refund you by forwarding an email or taking a screenshot of the message they sent."
Horrible company--do not use
#712 - Brian M'Horrible company--do not use'Millions of vulnerable passengers have now been saved from a fate worse than death....thanks to your detailed descriptive and timely warning....
"Really, really bad, they are impossible to contact, their phone number doesn't work. I paid extra to be able to cancel the flights just in case (because of COVID) and I haven't been able to because it is impossible to contact them. Disgusting."
"I paid extra to be able to cancel the flightsWithout detail, I'm taking a punt that what you bought was a ""Super-duper OTA add-on package"" which enables you to avoid OTA fees but will not turn your non-refundable airline ticket into a refundable one!"
Helena: Did you miss this thread when you gave them your money?You really MUST do research prior to making choices as to what companies you will work with. SO MANY bad online agencies out there.
"Please learn from this Helena789. It really is vital to research who you are giving money to before you do so. It's just as vital to check that what you are paying extra for suits your needs.In the latter case, it's incredibly rare that a cheap add on offered by a retailer will work well. tooagodunkown is right that it won't turn a non refundable ticket (a sow's ear if you like) into a refundable one ( a silk purse). At best, I suspect it will merely take away one or two fees that would otherwise be charged. At worst, I'd expect them to impose others to make up the money somewhere."
"dont go booking with mytrip i have been scam like everybody else, they take your money and run"
"Actually, it's probably more accurate to say that you choose to give them your money."
"5 months whitout solution by MytripSince March (almost 5 months) I've been waiting a solution by Mytrip. Due Covid, my tickets from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro were cancelled (me and my family, five passengers, a lot of money). And since that time until now Mytrip doesn't have any solution. They have forms on their website, but the link doesn't work. The customer's line is always busy and is very expansive call them in UK (I live in Portugal). They don't have pos-sales estructure."
It is impossible to get through to this company if you have any problems.
It is impossible to get through to this company if you have any problems.As it was when this thread started four years ago
"Toa is right, global. This thread has been warning you for four years. You've been a member long enough that you could have seen this and stayed away had you done the research then that you did today to find this."
Well I wasn't a member four years ago. I just looked it up today. Thanks though for your helpful imput
"""Well I wasn't a member four years ago""----According to your profile, you joined TA in August 2010..."
"#726'Well I wasn't a member four years ago. I just looked it up today.'So you just spent a lot of money without researching the company first?If it's any consolation most Online travel agents are the same,lacking easy contact at present.....they were once just crap.....now they are dire.....Depending on your problem,disputing payment,while keeping a record of contact attempts may be an option...........or a least learn to always book direct with an airline,would be a lesson learned.....we do not want to see you back here next year after falling for a few quid off,and booking Lastminute/Opodo etc....Good luck,and any more help needed give us the full facts,so we can advise better."
Looks like Sunmagic got the best answer of all!
"Do you have nothing better to do? Captain obvious. I didn't look up my trip 4 years ago, I;m looking them up today hence the message on the board. You really need to get a life and stop being so rude."
"You've been a member of TA for 10 yearsThis thread has been here for 4 yearsYou obviously had EVERY opportunity to research Mytrip.com both here and elsewhere on the internet. FIVE minutes of research would have told you to stay they heck away from them and from most of the other online agencies.Tim has some helpful advice in post 728, above. Suggest you attempt that but understand that when you give your money to bad companies sometimes it is lost forever."
""";m looking them up today hence the message on the board.""---If you feel comfortable in spending money online without doing any research first, then that's fine by me."
"#730'You really need to get a life and stop being so rude.'And you really need to get a brain,and stop lying.........absolutely no research before buying,then a temper tantrum when caught out lying.....Sunmagic is quite right....and you will no doubt learn nothing from the advice given to you today."
"It's really not the best way to do things when you don't look into who you plan on giving money to. It's your decision, of course, and you're far from being alone. But it really doesn't make anyone look good when they admit to not checking something when they could have. I hope that you will learn from this, and never repeat the mistake going forward."
"Appaling service and customer service. My flight back from New Zealand to London was cancelled at late notice but I received no notification. The airline states it is the agent's responsibility to inform the customer. I was left stranded at the airport with no alternative return flight offered or available to the UK due to covid.Despite my flight being cancelled I was told that I am not able to receive a full refund because I did not cancel my flight within 3 hours of its scheduled flight time (Even though the airline had cancelled it!?). No communication from My Trip at all. Finally, a refund of £167 was offered despite my flight costing more than double this.Never book with this organisation."
"Thanks, Matt. If the prior 730 posts didn't convince me, yours would.Why didn't the prior posts convince you not to use them?"
"This is the worst agency I usedThis is the worst agency I used, my flight was cancelled and I request a refund, so, trip said avianca gave me voucher with 9 months to expire, I told them I won’t travel but they said that’s not their problem.i read all flights airline are refunding money because the pandemic, I have the same problem with Expedia but the difference is Expedia gave me my money back after 4 days, definitely trip.com steal my money.I talked to the airline agency and they told me they’re refunding the money and I have to talk where I bought the tickets, anyway, just stay away from them"
"Thanks, Douglas. If the prior 730 posts didn't convince me, yours would.Why didn't the prior posts convince you not to use them?"
"hi there i just buy ticket under my trip, but did get the confirmation book...how to get the confirmation booking?"
"How long have you been waiting, ahlam? Maybe they haven't bought the ticket for you yet, so there's nothing to confirm. I daresay you only made a booking request to them."
THEY ARE A FAKE!!! WE WERE SCAMMED! Do NOT use this service. They stole our money!!! We got no trip! Beware!!! They are thieves!!!!!!!
"The 700+ posts already here didn’t warn you away, why will your post stop anyone else from doing the same?"
"A post with no detail which is nothing more than a few statements joined together is highly unlikely to persuade anyone, even if someone who needs to be warned sees it.As it goes, though mytrip are not fakes and they don't scam people. They are a proper company, though an awful one that I wouldn't go anywhere near."
"I booked a ticket from Lusaka (zambia) to Atlanta in US. The flight was supposed to be operated by Kenya Airways. A day before the flight I got a msg that the flight had been cancelled and i was offered to fly 5 days later or cancel the ticket. When I contacted the airline, I was told the other flight may not be on also. I requested to cancel the ticket and get a refund. Now they are saying they have requested for a refund and they will let me know if its approved. The flight was supposed to be on 10th August 2020 I have been massively inconvinienced. Its 3 weeks now and i have still not gotten my refund and their is no communication from them. I have sent numerous emails and made multiple calls. I am not getting any results.If they are not a fraud then they are very bad at their service. I am very unimpressed."
"Sorry, Liberty, but you picked a really bad company to deal with.That being said, it is taking airlines 3-4 months or more to issue refunds, and in your case that money is going to go to mytrip first. Then it will take them awhile to get you your money, so don't expect anything before 2021"
"Thanks Northern_Traveler for ya comment. Its very unsettling to think I have to wait months to get a refund. It took them less than 2 minutes to take my money from my credit card after I clicked ""pay"". They have to find a better way of dealing with refunds especially when the cancellation is not initiated by the traveller.I cant help feeling scummed by mytrip."
"It takes them thirty seconds to type your purchase info into the airline website (that you can do yourself) to buy a ticket for you.It takes much much longer to track down refunds and get them returned to you minus the fees you agreed to in their terms and conditions.They are NOT going to be hiring more people and increasing costs for a project like this.You will get your money when they get to you. If you want quality customer service you shouldn’t work with bottom feeding companies, you have to pay for quality service. Or better yet, book direct and remove the middleman"
">>>If they are not a fraud then they are very bad at their service.<<<It's definitely the latter.>>>Its very unsettling to think I have to wait months to get a refund.<<<I'm sure it is, but unfortunately that's the reality, especially at the moment because of covid-19. >>>They have to find a better way of dealing with refunds especially when the cancellation is not initiated by the traveller.<<<Why do they have to do this, if you don't mind me asking, and can you suggest anything that will speed things up? Please not what N_T said about them not spending extra money.I'm afraid this is the consequence of using a dismal ticket flogger rather than booking direct. If you'd done the latter, then you might still have had to wait for a refund, but it would have been much quicker than having it go through MyTrip. Remember this important lesson for the future!"
