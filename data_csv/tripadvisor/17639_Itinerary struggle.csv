"I understand that ultimately only I can decide what kind of itinerary works best for me, but I’m asking for some input to figure that out.This was my initial plan. Day 1: fly into LV, drive to Death ValleyDay2: Death Valley Day 3: wake early, drive to YosemiteDay 4: YosemiteDay 5: YosemiteDay 6: YosemiteDay 7: Wake early, drive to SonomaDay 8: SonomaDay 9: SonomaDay 10: Drive to San Fran. Afternoon flight home We plan on arriving on 9/12 and departing 9/21. Yosemite and Napa are musts. We were able to secure lottery permits for a Half Dome on 9/15. Obviously, this gives us little to no time in SF, unless we day grip there from Sonoma. At the very least, I’d like to visit Alcatraz. As much as I’d like to see Death Valley, I’m considering an itinerary that has us flying in and out of SF, and that’s where I could really use some assistance. We are outdoor lovers, but also enjoy leisure time. I’ve been to Monterey and am not to keen on visiting again. I appreciate any advice. Thanks"
"""I appreciate any advice.""Make sure everything is refundable."
Death Valley excruciatingly hot in September. Given this itinerary squeezing in Alcatraz will be difficult. No one knows when Yosemite or Alcatraz will be reopened.
"Assuming the SF tourist attractions are open, then you'll have to choose between one of your current destinations or SF... you don't have time to do all 4. If you're flying into LV, that pretty much requires at least a stop in Death Valley, although I suppose you could reduce it to one night and take a night or two from Sonoma (or Yosemite) to create 2-3 nights in SF. But in my opinion, any major destination deserves at least 4 nights/3 full days."
"Assuming this can even be done.....in and out of SFO since you are contemplating that anyway. Save yourself a long, long drive.You say Napa is a must but are staying in Sonoma. They are indeed close but different feel.Good luck. Congrats on winning lottery. Hope you can use the permits, but......."
"I think it makes sense to spend a little time in the high country on the day before a Half Dome hike. So that might be a nice long day hike from Tioga Road. If you keep your ""In LAS and Out SFO"" plan, don't stay in Death Valley on Night 2 but rather get much closer to the Tioga Pass Entrance of Yosemite so you can get in some high altitude hiking.Where are you staying in Yosemite?Are you okay with the one way drop fee for the rental car?If you use SFO for both in & out, I still suggest spending Day 3 hiking in the high country in preparation for Half Dome on Day 4."
Alcatraz sucks up a lot of time so don’t try and do it on your travel day. I’d cut a day from Sonoma. I’d also be tempted to split Sonoma and Napa with 2 different lodgings. But map out where you really want to go and maybe 1 of those is your better base.
just fly in and out of bay area or sacramento of fresnodeath valley will be too hot.
"Should’ve prefaced this post by stating the obvious: everything is/will be booked w trip insurance. Hopefully, things are somewhat normalized by then, if not, there’s always next yeear.I’d like to see Death Valley, but the temperature this time of year is what has me reconsidering. Especially if we’re unable to hike, even in the AM.If we fly in and out of SF, how would you structure an itinerary?Factoring in 3-4 nights in Yosemite (1 of which would have to be the 14-15 for Half Dome, at least night night in SF to see Alcatraz, and 2-3 nights in Sonoma/Napa. Is there anything else we can add? Is Big Sur out of the question?"
"When you visited Monterey in the past, did you neglect to drive down Hwy 1 for the ""best bits"" section (through Big Sur?) If you don't want to go to Monterey again, then enjoying time in Big Sur is challenging.Do you have to arrive on Sept 12?SFO - Yosemite - Sonoma/Napa - SF - SFOEarlier arrival: SFO (or OAK) - SF - {pick up reserved rental car and drive to} Yosemite - Napa/Sonoma - SFO (or OAK)"
"It’s been almost 20 years since I last visited the area (we did something similar: SF-Sonoma/Napa-Yosemite-Monterey-SF..though I don’t remember the exact order). We did drive Big Sur, but I was a kid at the time, and my head was probably buried in a magazine or game it at the time, so I didn’t appreciate it nearly as much as I should have. I could be wrong about Monterey, but I don’t remember enjoying It much. We stayed right by the aquarium and I recall being underwhelmed by the area. I could be wrong though."
"There is spectacular coastal scenery in Sonoma, too. It is not just wine country."
"Regarding Monterey, visiting as a kid and as an adult are definitely different experiences - as you mentioned with your experience with Big Sur. And Cannery Row, where the aquarium is located, is the center of touristy Monterey. I think it would be easy to come away underwhelmed if your only memories of Monterey are that area. We go to Monterey regularly and the last time we visited Cannery Row was a few years ago for a car event. Additionally, when people talk about visiting Monterey, they usually mean the entire Monterey Peninsula, which includes Pacific Grove and Carmel. There is a lot to the area."
"Another option for you.Day 1: SFDay2: Calaveras Big Trees State Park.https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=551Day3: YosemiteDay4: Yosemite, Half DomeDay 5: YosemiteDay 6: Bridgeport or South Lake Tahoe via Tioga Pass and the outstanding Hwy.395Day 7: SonomaDay 8: SonomaDay 9: SFDay 10: SF. Afternoon flight home"
"Great point. I didn’t realize Monterey encompassed Carmel, which I remember being beautiful. My associated Cannery row with Monterey. Maybe we can work it in after all."
"Also, read the fine print on your insurance. When this started, I read posts from people whose travel insurance didn't cover epidemics, etc. And especially booking once this is a known risk may fall under ""pre-existing conditions""."
I didn’t realize how close Pinnacles NP is to The Monterey area. Perhaps if we add another day we could fit it in as a day trip en route to Yosemite.I’m thinking SF-Monterey/Pinnacles-Yosemite-Sonoma-SF9/12 looks like our definite arrival date. The only obstacle would be working things around (hopefully) hiking half dome on 9/15.
"I know we're all antsy to travel, but you've added half a dozen possible stops to your itinerary since this thread began! Scale it back again to 2 primary destinations.Have you been to Yosemite before? If you haven't, you'll want to spend a day or two checking out all the iconic sights in Yosemite Valley, plus a day hiking at elevation before you Half Dome hike.The Sonoma coast is just as rugged and scenic as Big Sur. There are 6 or 7 lovely beaches (for walking and tide pooling, NOT swimming) north of Bodega Bay, and Hwy. 1 north of Jenner twists and turns right on the cliffside, just as in Big Sur.IF everything is open in Sept., and I wouldn't put much money on it, then I'd go straight from the airport to either Sonoma, or Yosemite - with a possible one or two nights in the Gold Country which is right on your way. Save Alcatraz and SF for another trip."
"I’m not Naive to the fact that this trip may not happen, but I like to remain optimistic, especially at a time like this - trip planning is a pleasant distraction and gives me something to look forward to. I enjoying conversing with and picking the brains of local experts. I’ve received invaluable advice on here when planning prior trips. I’m unfamiliar with gold country, but at quick glance, it looks beautiful. That now makes “a half dozen” plus 1 spots I’m considering.It’s been quite some time, but I’ve been to Yosemite before.Given that almost an entire day will be dedicated to half dome, I think anything less than 4 nights would be a disservice."
"It is definitely fun, distracting, and pleasant to imagine trips in the future.Here are some older but still valuable threads about Gold Rush country and two websites:tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28926-i29-k4475035tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g33152-i4316-k9835…www.historichwy49.com/mainmap.htmlwww.visitcalifornia.com/attraction/highway-49"
"I wouldn't try to include Pinnacles - your itinerary is already pretty tight, and in September it will be hot, dry and brown out there. The average high in September is 95°F and triple-digit days aren't uncommon. Even though it's only about an hour from Monterey, it is inland and has very different weather."
"Your itinerary is definitely doable with some minor changes. If it is your first time In SF And you want to have some time to visit the city, I would suggest to check your priorities/things you don’t want to miss. Almost 4 days in Yosemite is good if you are a big hiker or a climber, otherwise you could cut it 1 dd short. Sonoma is close to SF and it is a nice place but i would spend only 1 night there, this will give you some time for SF.This is the link to buy alcatraz tickets; if you are planning to visit it I would buy them as soon as they re-open o may 4...you can cancel and get the refund up to few days before your tour.https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/"
"Thank you all for the information. It’s very much appreciated Here’s where I stand with trip musts:1.) 4 nights Yosemite - we are avid hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, so while I have have visited Yosemite before, I think anything less than 4 nights would be a disservice 2.) At least 2 nights in Sonoma/Napa - I promised my wife some leisure time in wine country. If she’s willing to hike Half Dome for me (hopefully), it’s the least I can do3.) visit Alcatraz. I’ve been to SF before. I don’t feel compelled to spend too much time in the city, but I’d regret not taking my wife to experience Alcatraz. I’ve visited it before and was captivated. 1 night in SF should suffice, especially bc we won’t be able to catch a ballgameMy dilemma is figuring out how to fill the remaining 2-3 days. Those Gold Country resources were great. Thank you. I still have a lot of reading up on the area to do to see if it’s worth trying to fit it in.I’m still leaning towards trying to work in Pinnacles, even if it means spending 1/2 day there while enroute to Yosemite. I’ve spent significant time hiking the Southwest during the summer months, so the heat is hardly a bother."
"Here is another idea to throw into the mix: Paso Robles wine country.From Yosemite, head to Paso Robles (or to the Santa Ynez region.) Enjoy wineries. Drive up Hwy 1 through the ""best bits"" section to Monterey or Carmel. Continue to SF for one night, then back south to SFO."
"I was able to secure a lodge at Curry village the night before we hike half dome. They have a full cancellation policy up until 7 days prior to arrival, which is a big plus"
"Congratulations on getting a reservation in the closest lodging! Note that Curry Village does not really have a ""lodge"" but has many tent cabins, a few hard sided cabins, and a few motel-like rooms."
"Congratulations on getting the Half Dome Cables permit. But some cautionary comment from a Half Dome Summit veteran who failed at the first 2 attempts.You may be in the young-and-fit category but do not under-estimate the physical demand it takes to summit Half Dome on a day hike. Any way you look at it, from the Valley Floor, it is a 5000 feet climb, round-trip of 18+ miles on the same day. Plus being at 9000 feet level at the summit, many people have altitude sickness issue going higher up. It is not an ""easy peasy"" walk in the park.Driving from sea level (0' elevation) to Yosemite Valley (4000' elevation), without warm up, and the next day hiking Half Dome (9000' elevation)... it is disastrous for many people.At a minimum, I always advise to allow time for high-altitude acclamation at least for one day. For example, drive up to Yosemite Valley (4000' feet) first day. Second day drive to Tuolumne Meadows (7000' - 8000') and do a short warm-up hike, a few miles round-trip at 8000' to 9000' level. Climb at least 1000 to 2000 feet. Allow the body to adjust to high altitude. Before the hike to HD summit. And start early. Many start the hike at 5 am.I have see a few hikers got caught unprepared. They finally climbed to the top of Subdome and there were totally exhausted. And they were dehydrated. They thought that was the top. Only to see that there is a 500 feet climb on steel cables at a 45-degree climb to the top. They couldn't do it. And bring some gloves for the steel cable climb. (And watch out for the aggressive chipmunks at the top of the subdome who will ransack your backpack for food while you are not resting and not watching.)"
"Good for you for getting reservations at Camp Curry. I'd encourage you to get at least one more night there as the Valley makes a great 'base camp' for exploring Yosemite. 4 nights total is not too much time imo. Suggest you view this excellent 10 min. video on YouTube, put out by the NPS on hiking Half Dome. 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue7uIcRZBUU'I've done it twice, many years ago in my 20's when I was fit and used to the altitude - it wiped me out both times!For your extra 2 to 3 days I would think just add to either Sonoma or SF, or spend a couple days in Gold Country. There are at least half a dozen caves or caverns scattered throughout the area. You take tours to see them that last at least 2 hours. Black Chasm, up by Volcano, is one of my favorites. Or stop by Coloma State Park, where gold was first discovered, and try your hand at gold panning.Sonoma is my home. What kind of things do you and your wife want to experience here? We have wine tasting and restaurants of course, but also the Russian River and the Sonoma Coast. It would be easy to extend your stay here for an extra 2 days."
"Excellent point regarding altitude. Altitude is a tricky thing.. we were out in Colorado last September, and it Was definitely a factor, especially staying in Telluride, which is 9k + feet. We did a spectacular hike in the area - 9 miles, 3k feet in again to a 13k foot summit, and it was challenging. Luckily, HD is significantly lower, so hopefully the altitude isn’t as much as a factor. I agree with you both though - it would probably behoove us to spend a night or 2 acclimating. We’re outdoor enthusiasts, but wine tasting is definitely top of our priority list in Sonoma. When I visited as a teenager 20 years ago, I remember loving the area. It was quaint and charming. I recall Napa being a bit more commercial. I don’t mind splurging on lodging, if you have any recommendations. NWPF - yes, it was one of the cabins with electricity and outlets. I was surprised to see that the Ahwahnee also had a night available for around $500/night. I’m going to keep monitoring their site, but I have a feeling we’ll be bouncing around from place to place."
"I really like the little town of Sonoma. Its central Plaza is ringed with shops, restaurants, and a State Historic Park. There are about 10 hotels in town, but 2 that are lovely, and close to the Plaza are the El Dorado Hotel - just across the street from the Plaza, and the Inn at Sonoma at 630 Broadway.About 10 miles north, on Hwy. 12 in the village of Kenwood, there's the Kenwood Inn and Spa, or Beltane Ranch. They are both more of destination resorts, since there's no Plaza to explore. But Kenwood is in the center of Sonoma Valley and is surrounded by dozens of wineries."
