Is anyone still travelling to Bali with the coronavirus warnings?
"Tinker you are going to get a heap of responses here of people that are and people that are not, will it help with your own decision ?"
"Tinker, the wisest thing to do is to weigh up your potential health risks in consultation with your GP, check the travel advisories from your government and consider the availability and efficacy of heath infrastructure (or otherwise) in Bali should you contract the virus. As Dianne says, there are so many differing opinions on this forum that it might only serve to make you more confused in reaching a decision."
Thanks - that’s what we have done!
That's what i am thinking about to... When are you maybe going over?
"I leave in a couple of weeks and have absolutely no intention of cancelling. Can’t wait,"
"Hey Tinker,In Bali now with my wife. Been here for almost 2 weeks.Been in Asia since Dec 8.There is literally no one wearing masks. It's everyday life as usual.Having been here since before the outbreak started, I made a little vlog on what I've been seeing and my personal opinion of whether a trip is worth cancelling because of it. If you have a few min, check it out. Hopefully you find it helpful. https://youtu.be/SdZzhd1yH6Y"
My pleasure. It really makes a big difference. Have an AMAZING trip. Enjoy.
"As mentioned above, it really is up to you. If you are healthy and don't mind traveling at this time then you already have your decision. Coronvirus is only just appearing (officially) in Indonesia and my guess is that it will probably soon be in Bali but at the moment the numbers of confirmed cases is still very low.My sister in law who works in Kuta says her staff no longer shake hands with guests, they instead put their right hand up to their opposite shoulder to avoid direct contact. So less direct contact and lots of using hand sanitizer should make it safer."
Myself and a friend are going over on March 24th. We plan on being conscientious hand washers.We are staying outside Ubud. I can’t say I’m too concerned.
"That’s really reassuring, thanks."
"We are going in 2 weeks. Just do the usual things about keeping hands clean etc. We will only cancel if Bali goes to ""Do not travel"". Can't wait to go!"
I am here in Bali currently and will be here for 2 weeks. I am here with friends and we haven't even thought of the virus since we got here. No masks or panic or hype. We are truly happy that we did not cancel.
Oh dear. Can’t believe it all changed so fast. We are now holidaying in Queensland...

Yep - we cancelled again. Looks like it will be a local holiday now. And yes to the poster who said that people wanted to push on with plans - yes they did! And who said there were no warnings? But who would have predicted that Tasmania would close its internal border with the rest of Australia even 1 week ago...
"From the Indonesian government travellers from the UK not allowed in. Airlines are shutting down so travel is also restricted. Perhaps time to reconsider. No hand sanitiser left in Bali. Also many shops, hotels and restaurants are closing. I leave tomorrow after almost two months. With no work and no income many Balinese are facing very tough times.Edited: 3:49 am, March 19, 2020 "
"We were due to arrive 14 April. Asked the property owner yesterday for a local update on the situation and she simply referred me to the Indonesia Embassy. They tell me that effective Friday, 20 March, 00.00 Western Indonesia Time anybody thathas visited Iran, Italy, Vatican, Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland or theUK in the precedi g 14 days will be refused entry. All visitors will be required to provide a Health Alert Certificate.End of our intended visit. Hopefullyof some help to those still undecided. As mentio ed many times, the situation is regularly changing .... Currently for the worse."
I expect for the US to be added to the list of restricted countries pretty soon. Our numbers of confirmed cases are exploding. We are currently the 6th highest in world of confirmed COVID-19 cases. We just surpassed South Korea and France.
"She forgot to mention you will need a Visa from the Indonesian Embassy, no VOA. There will be a lot of people being turned away and on the first flight home tomorrow."
I haven't read all the comments but be aware that the VOA has been suspended for countries including Aus so you will have to a visa prior to travel with a health certificate. If you arrive in Bali without your bus you will denied entry
