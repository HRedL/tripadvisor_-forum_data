How is the situation in Coorg. Is it stable now? Or it is still in recovering phase? Any signs of epidemic? Had plans to travel to Coorg for couple of days in September end - not sure if I should change it.
"Ban on travel to Coorg lifted from today.However tourists advised not to visit Abby Falls, Mullpatti and a few other places.Rest is fine"
We've planned our Coorg trip from September 13 - September 16. We have booked resort in Madikeri and we'll be driving from Mysore. Are roads safe to drive from Mysore to Coorg? Also as asked in original question - Any signs of epidemic?
Things are getting back to normal. Mysuru-Coorg roads are safe except for a few stretches of repair works .There is no epidemic threat in Coorg.
Thanks Deepak. Its really helpful.

"I've been there from monday to thursday..started my journey from mysore..we booked the home stay in madikeri nr. Raja's seat...the roads are safe..some of the places are closed like abbey falls, mallali falls(not sure), mandalpatti, tadiyandabol, tala kaveri temple is opened but the view point which is located upstairs is closed due to landslides..you can stay there 2-3 days there for sight seeing and then 2 days in mysore for other falls and local sight seeing.. however the gate keeper of the abbey falls said it will be opened from 1st of october..Edited: 1 year ago "
