"Hello everyone. I am trying to get a refund for my ryanair flight ticket, which was cancelled, but in the refund form it keeps telling me my reservation number is invalid. Has anyone else had the same problem? What can I do to solve this issue?"
Did you originally book through Ryanair or a 3rd party
Hi all we are having the same issue please can someone explain if they managed to successfully apply for a refund? Thank you!
I’m having the same issue! I feel like it could be a tactic to avoid giving refunds
<< I’m having the same issue! I feel like it could be a tactic to avoid giving refunds >>Yet another conspiracy theory. Have you tried sending them a DM via twitter or a PM via Facebook? All the airlines are snowed under at the moment so unless you were due to travel in the next few days I'd wait a while.
same sh..
"I tried more times, but I also received the same answer."
Yes - today. I know the reservation number I'm typing is correct.
I have tried to contact them but to no avail
I think it could be a tactic to not refund. I'm going to try and ring them. Will update on here if I get any success
Me too :( Anyone know how to fix this? I know I'm not entering anything incorrectly !
Me too :(( I can not contact with them other than a robot for chatting online on their webpage !
tried the form without translating to English. Got a different error message this time. Something about not cancelled > 3 hours yet
"Same here,my flight for today 17.03.20 was cancelled by Ryanair yesterday and its not letting me process the refund and have been waiting over 2 hours in online chat but no help."
Looks like they will go Bankrupt most probably just like most other Airlines. I booked through Visa so will write to them I suppose.
I’m Getting the same message as well. Incorrect ref being used but I know I’ve entered the correct details. No email address or Facebook page to message. Phone lines dead or no answer. I’m afraid this is a Ryanair tactic to keep the money as long as possible- maybe until they go into administration??
"Same thing happening here- Has to be a ploy to keep our money, they’ll need it over the next few months with all the groundings."
Oh please. Some people in this thread really need to chill out.
"@Leexpress - this is a forum that people can and should talk openly, its interesting why you say that they should 'chill out' without any substance whatsoever!"
...because spreading conspiracy theories is not helping anyone.Let’s all show a degree of patience with companies and staff in all over whelmed businesses during these times. Big boy pants required.
"Sadly, my family has the same problem.. and we booked straight from Ryanair, so there was no outside booking. Their “live chat” is automatic, so does not help much.."
same here
"I'm too wanting a refund... Sadly my flight has not been cancelled for Thursday despite the FCO advising all but essential travel and that Spain is, now closing its borders.I don't want to change my flight to another date as that may not be covered by insurance.I think Ryanair are leaving cancellations as long as possible hoping people will change them instead. But also I imagine they are very busy right now. I'm going to contact my insurance company today for advice. Good luck everyone."
HI I have same problem. I am sure my reservatiovation number is corectI also do not know what to do. Lauda from Vienna to Lisbon.
"Same problem here. Flight from Krakow to Madrid canceled. When applying for a refund, my 6 digit code is invalid."
"The same problem, Flight from Dublin to Modlin and back from Modlin to Belfast - both cancelled and I have a problem with cancellation."
Yes having same issue
"""its interesting why you say that they should 'chill out' without any substance whatsoever!""A lot more substance than your ridiculous claim hat they are about to go bankrupt!"
I switched language to Norwegian and it worked!
You can always try to apply for refund by thi website https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/
"There you go - as the saying goes ""necessity is the mother of invention"" . well done Laksiya B !!!!"
"It didn't work for me@MenorcaRegularEdited: 4:42 am, March 17, 2020 "
Same here. Meant to be travelling from UK to Krakow. Everytime I try to process the refund it say there was an error. I'm really starting to wonder if they are just trying to hang on to our money as a friend got their refunds from easyjet within 24 hours.
Same here. Ryanair is the worst.
Having the exact same problem . How ever when I went into change flight just to see want happens . Oddly it is allowing me to do that no problem
Just speculating but it's possible there's a system lag due to a high level cancellations. So basically the system does not recognise certain booking references as cancelled (yet). That would explain why it's possible to change your flight.
"Same problem. Have 8 tickets for my family. Can't apply for a refund. Chat doesn't work as well (only useless chatbox). Tried to call them from Germany, auto-response says smth lile the number doesn't work."
same issue here. Wonder if they are staggering refunds. They really should let us know. I have tweeted them – no results yet
"Had exactly the same error message last night, again UK - Krakow return.I eventually realised that the probable root cause in my case was that my outbound flight had been cancelled, but not the inbound. I had ticked the option for a refund of the entire booking reference for all passengers, so I think it was rejecting me because I was trying to get a refund for an uncancelled flight.I didn't pursue it and try instead for the partial refund, as I think I saw a restriction saying that only one online refund application was possible per booking reference. So now I've got my eyes peeled for them cancelling the inbound leg as well of course, at which point I'll try again.Cue new questions about whether some or all of this is deliberate policy to avoid refunds, but for the moment I'm inclined to cut even Ryanair some slack ..."
Absolutely same issue...anyone got a refund?
"Same for me, sure that their system are not scalable for this kind of problem. Yes it could be a strategy to say that you don' t ask for a refund ... of course .."
I ve tried all and still having the same problem...
"Same issue, refund doesnt work, - to Marrakech flight for some reason is not cancelled (even if it is obvious that we are not allowed to travel by goverment, they will not let us leave the country), - return flight from Marrakech is cancelled, -I am entering my reservation number and it is not recognized.... so no chance, they are cheating, dont want to refund, trying to force you change the date...but I dont wanna change dates, wanna refund only"
"the same problem here, reservation number invalid - but this seems to be standard for Ryanair, I have experienced the same before"
Same for me reservation number invalid
The same problem today. They don't answer the phone nor chat.
"I have applied on this website here ""https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/"". After that I got email from ryanair ""Thank you for your claim!This will be assessed by one of our Customer Service Agents and we will be in contact within the next 10 days.Yours sincerely, Ryanair Customer Services"" My flight is tomorrow so should I wait next 10 days for processing? :-D"
"""My flight is tomorrow so should I wait next 10 days for processing?""Is your flight cancelled? If so, just wait until I get their technical issues fixed and claim a refund the usual way. There's no requirement that you must request a refund before your flight was scheduled to depart."
"I will try to refund every hour, but it seems that this problem is here since yesterday, which means they had a plenty of time to repair it."
"Having the same issue,did you get a reply from them yet"
Good luck.. i was in their phone queue for an hour before i was forced to hang up..
Still trying to get a refund. Booking number still not recognized.
I am getting the exact same message and I know what I am entering to be correct. Frustrating and makes their lives more complicated too
Any luck? I a having the same problem
Me too!
Yes same here.. I’m loosing the will to live
Having the same problem. But funny though that as an experiment I tried to change the booking and doesn’t seem to be a problem
Same issue with me...invalid reservation number but i know it is correct
"I have the sala problem. I have 3 flights cancelled. When I try to request refund they say it had a problem and that I should use the form, when I use the form it says that the flight wasn't cancelled or delayed by >3h, when I use their chat they tell me to use the first refund option I used, same when try contacting via Facebook. I think they are trying to make people give up on refund or at least delay as long as possible. Going broke is big possibility not only for RyanAir, but for many companies in the following months."
Has anyone got more info?
It's not accepting my refund form either - just says please complete the CAPTCHA - which I am doing and is correct?Very frustrating!
Glad it's not just me...
Have the same! Did you try to contact them somehow and get some RELIABLE information? :/
"I have the same!!I booked it via Ryanair website, I received an email on the flight day telling me my flight was cancelled and I can receive a refund. The reservation/booking number is clearly displayed on my printout ticket and in the emails from Ryanair BUT the online page for refunding always rejects my claim with the message 'Your flight reservation number is invalid. Please check the flight reservation number you have entered'"
"Same problem, same message. Come. on Ryanair get this sorted."
Same here. Got the email today and completing form correctly and getting reservation number invalid. This is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. I will keep trying though.
Im having same problem - perhaps best to wait a few days if possible. No answer on phone either - been on hold for half an hour.
"yes, I'm currently having the exact same problem and don't know how to resolve it!"
Also system not allowing changes to flights either
"""my recommendation is to take a screenshot every time, the system refuses your request(take one before and after) just in case to show that you have filed it in properly""Why? There's no deadline for claiming a refund if your flight is cancelled."
"I'm no expert, but if they've cancelled the flight(s), then there can be no reservations for them, so reservation numbers will be meaningless.Apparently, Ryanair's web chat is pretty good at spring things out.The airlines are having a meeting with Grant Shapps, the Transport Minister (I think) tomorrow, but the BBC News this morning said that both Ryanair and Easyjet are considering cancelling all flights.Edited: 7:28 am, March 17, 2020 "
"""but if they've cancelled the flight(s), then there can be no reservations for them, so reservation numbers will be meaningless.""That's not how it works. I've looked up reservations many times in the past to find a flight is listed as cancelled. Think about it, how would an airline rebook or refund affected passengers if a cancelled flight erased all reservations on it?"
"Yes me too cancelled flight to France yesterday,, I'M SURE IT'S A SCAM to avoid having to pay !!!!"
"I've been dealing with the exact same problem for the past 3 days. I've been trying to get a refund for return flights for me and my partner (since they have been cancelled and we are not allowed to enter the country of our destination), and it keeps telling me the reservation code is invalid."
Im having the same problem....
Have to tried to spoke to Ryanair workers at the airport? Maybe they could help or tell what to do at least?
What deadline? Do you know?
"I have the same issue right now. Got a mail from Ryanair that the flight was cancelled (London -Oslo) and that I could claim for refund on their web page. Just saying that reservation number is invalid. I know for a fact that its correct. Waited 2 hours on chat (while doing other things) no reply, Have also tried to call several customer service numbers (UK, Norway) just all dead ends. What a scam...."
The same problem here it is saying your reservation number is invalid.Anyone any luck?
"Same with me, bit annoying that they send me an email inviting me to collect a refund then the refund system doesn't work!"
"Hi, i have the same problem..i sent them an email and I waiting for an answer"
"I have tried the refund form over 100x times and attempted to talk to someone but nothing so far. This is how all the Airlines which went into administration did. Nothing on news about this issue which everyone is facing. I highly doubt that anything will be done by Ryanair about this at all. Few weeks down the line, news will be that Ryanair went into administration, thats it!"
"I also have the same problem - always error message ""reservation number not correct"". We have contacted the customer service (haha) and have been online in the chat for 2 hours waiting for response - nothing.I agree with others that it is a tactic from Ryanair to put their customers off, and that we give up to ask for refund.Absolutely appalling !!"
"""We have contacted the customer service (haha) and have been online in the chat for 2 hours waiting for response - nothing.""It's almost like something's going on at the moment that might cause more people than usual trying to contact them...."
Same here. Same problem!

"I have the same problem. Probably some server error on their side, we'll just have to wait, I guess."
Same issue! Invalid Reservation Number :(
"Got through to Ryanair phone number after 75 mins. They have issued refund, says 28 working days and confirmation email within 24 hours. Knowing them they just say that and put phone down, biggest crooks going"
"wonder if they are trying to stagger refunds? That's ok, so long as it's communicated."
"Same issue for me, will try to speak to AMEX about it. Not sure we can just cancel the transaction..."
"you give all these clever responses, are you a Ryanair respresentative? we are all aware and affected by corona virus situation, and fully understand if systems and / or people are overworked. But if that is the case Ryanair should not send out hundreds or thousands of emails to customers with a refund link that doesnt work - for days it seems. This causes a lot of extra frustration.Instead send an email to inform that flight is cancelled, and that the refund will take xx days to be activiated. This would save a lot of time and frustration for all."
Agreed. I'm sure everyone would understand.
Yes. I have had the same problem with a flight cancelled tomorrow from Limoges to London. Unable to get any reply from Ryanair. I have filled in a complaint form on their website.
"Hi,I tried many times, and after more than 20 tryes once it worked. I don't know how, because i tried with the same details every time :/"
At least send a form through https://contactform.ryanair.com/index.phpso they cant say you didnt apply for a refund
At least contact them before your travel date through https://contactform.ryanair.com/index.php so they cannot say you didnt submit a request
我也是同样的问题
I have the same problem. Do you find a solution? I cant contact with ryanair
"Yes, I had the same issue. I am pretty sure they are trying to push people to change the flight dates and making it harder for people to refund. They are grade 1 bloodsuckers but what else does one expect?"
"I hope you guys all took screen-prints of your online interactions and communications with them to use as proof should you need it as evidence laterEdited: 9:25 am, March 17, 2020 "
"If you’ve tried to get a ticket refund (after receiving an email about your flight being cancelled), but it doesn’t work, you can try this – I did, just to try everything (since the chat is probably never going to work, as they’re flooded with requests). So:• went to My Bookings, Get Refund, checked the 2 names on the tickets for a refund, got the message “Click here to submit your refund request directly to our Customer Service team”• clicked on the link for my country (https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/?lg=RO), completed all data, but got the message that the the reservation number is invalid (which it isn’t, it just doesn’t work; I tried in different languages too)• went online, to see if anyone else had the same issue – found this thread (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…) and followed instructions from there• submitted this form (https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/) with all the details• sent an email to RAEAenquiries@osg.ie, explaining all the steps above (with attached pictures of the failed refunds from refundclaims.ryanair.com) and asked for my money back• received an email from them, saying Dear Customer, Your submission has been received and is being reviewed by our Customer Service team. Your reference number is .............. Due to a high volume of contacts from customers there may be a slight delay in us responding to you, we would ask that you please bear with us. Our Customer Service team will be in touch shortly to update you on your case. To add additional comments or documents, please reply to this email and it will be automatically added to the case. • so they received the message, now all I can do is wait and hope they’re going to pay me backGood luck!"
"I followed steps described above and got email from their Support: As this cancellation was unexpected and for safety reasons, we wish to inform you that no compensation is due under EU261/2004 as this was caused due to extraordinary circumstances beyond Ryanair's control.I trust that the above information has clarified matters in this regard.Does anyone received the same? It's ridiculous!"
I have received the same answer.
Probably because you are not claiming compensation under EU261 but a refund so your request would be invalid.
only my outbound flight was cancelled also from Northern Ireland to Kraków. Keep me posted if u get notification that both have been cancelled
i think the made like this specially ... they don't want back money back that's why this problem
"Hello, this is the same thing that I'm facing as well on my return trip. I have tried cancelling one leg of the trip at a time as well as the entire reservation in one go, however i kept seeing the same issue about my reservation number being incorrect. Moreover, I am not able to connect to customer support via phone to discuss this issue. This is crazy and highly unprofessional of Ryan Air to be sending communications when the choices do not work at all."
Even if you want change your flight to another date you will see all ticktes are more expensive than what's your ticket cost...their programmer did like that.. so you even pay more if you want change ticktes
Hi!!Same issue. I have tried several times and the message still appears.
I'm having the same problems. I am entering my booking ref correctly but getting the same message that I have entered the wrong booking ref. I have tried calling Ryanair but always engaged then get cut off. I have tried on-line chat and was put in over a 6 hour waiting queue to chat with customer service but got disconnected after waiting over 4 hours. Getting no where with Ryanair.
":D I tried, didn't work anymore."
I have the same problem. Please help!
"While I would normally attribute something like this to IT problems, the fact that this has been ongoing for some time, and (importantly) this is the morally bankrupt airline known as RyanAir, I wouldn't put it past them to be taking as long as possible to rectify the IT issue in order to try and manage the amount of refunds they need to process."
"Have the same problem, booking reference invalid. Have a friend who was booked on the same flight, claimed her refund using a laptop, said it worked fine for her, she just clicked on the link in the cancellation email. I only have a tablet so can't do that but thought it may be an idea for anyone with access to one. As it stands, I may just try the EU261compensations claim form - better than nothing - or wait and see if the glitch is sorted."
It doesn't work for me even with laptop. Tried EU261 form and already refused by RyanAir .
"Yes it works !! But you must try 15 or 20 times !!!Thanks this forum, somebody do the same before !"
Same problem and have been now 2 hours waiting on chat flight is canx reservation number is correct so this must be one of the usual Ryanair scams
"I have the same issue. Someone writes to wait, but I am not sure I will get the refund, if I will ask for it after the day of my booked flight. :/"
I've tried about 50 times now with different languages and no go. Is Ryanair seriously trying to avoid giving refunds but pretending they are giving us that option?
"Same problem here. I have tried with Explorer, Chrome, Edge and Safari.....same problem!"
Advise from Ryanair is to to clear your browser´s cookies/cache or try a different browser as this can help solve some minor web issues. I am going to try that.
Yes getting the same issue today will try in a few days give them a chance to fix issues
and reading further it didnt help. sorry.
Same here.Multiple attempts on laptop and desktop. Same result.
"I had used the link suggested by some people at the begining of this topic: https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/but they just wrote me back, that i was not entitled to a compensation (although I had selected the option expenses ONLY) and that for expenses I should use the link for refund. I wrote them again it didn't work, but it looks like this is indeed some method to make things last"
"#77How do you know how Ryanair's computer system is set up? We are in an unprecedented situation currently, so it may have been programmed so that an actual human has to intervene - I don't suppose anyone thought they'd be needing to cancel so many flights."
Same with flight FR 5120 WROCŁAW to PODGORICA. Same issue. Booked directly from Ryanaair website.
I'm having the same problem.
"Having same problemonth, flight cancelled today , going mad thinking get it am doing it wrong"
"I can't find a number for them, can you help with this?"
I have the same problem trying to claim the taxes back (although not sure if I get anything but I thought I would try).
Same problem!
"Same problem here. Have tweeted to Ryanair, no answer (yet). My guess is they are probably swamped or have a cash-flow problem returning the fares..."
"Same problem, very frustrating. Sent messages via chatbot. I will await a reply. Think they are overwhelmed.If anyone has had other solutions< I should be grateful."
I have been trying all day too and keep getting the same response that my reservation number is not valid. Does anyone know how long we have to claim a full refund as I also fear it is a ploy by Ryanair
"I have the same problem. I tried to send the form a lot of times, but every time got the same message:"" your reservation number is invalid""."
same here. they are trying to avoid refunding to people. I have waited hours on web chat but noone is answering. Phone number is same. Big Shame!!!
"After all day I am back. Still trying and still the same. Just now I received email from Ryanair that my flight was cancelled with a link to get a refund. But yes, still same issue - RyanAir is playing a game and they know very well about this issue."
Some problem. They have drawned in refunds and are deliberately stalling for time
Hi Martin.The exact same thing is happening to me also!Maybe their website is too busy to process anymore refund applications at present!?
"Same issue, cant change flight and cant get a refund, I dont want to do any business with a company like this.Edited: 1:51 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Same here, incredibly frustrating and no response from phones or chat bot. Think it may well be a delay tactic, not holding out much hope for a refund but I will try again over the next few days."
100% agreed
"I face the same problem. All entered information is correct, reservation number as well and it keeps giving the same error message back regarding reservation number. SUCKS!!!!"
"We have the same situation here, very upsetting."
People! You need to blow up Ryanair's Twitter page and loop in AirlineDispute! https:/…1239538281714515969
"If it makes you feel better, we are having the same problem. I also have attempted to contact customer care via the chat, and have waited over three hours with no response. As an alternative, I tried to change the dates of travel, ""free of charge."" Supposedly when you get to the end of the process, the difference in the price of the old and new tickets is zeroed out. Doesn't seem to be the case. The only button at the end of my efforts says ""Pay now"" and there is clearly over $131 about to be charged to my credit card. If it's this hard to get a refund now after a COVID cancellation, I'm not about to add to the total bill, to be sorted out later."
"We also have the same problem, clearly not anything we are doing wrong. It would good customer service for Ryanair to clarify why their refund page isn't working.Good Luck everyone"
I am having a same problem. I feel like they are trying to avoid any refunds from what I am reading here. They are the worst airline I have ever dealt with and I am never booking with them again. They might be going bankrupt anyway.
"Yes, we have been trying all day and we keep getting the same message re flight details being incorrect. Perhaps it's an issue that Joe Duffy and Liveline could clarify."
"I'm having same issue, did anyone get a reply from them"
Exactly the same. Doesn't recognise the Booking Reference Number although Ryanair have sent me an e-mail informing me the flight is cancelled which shows the booking reference!!!!!!
"Same problem, I have just tried this one:http://frd.ie/help/?language=nlLet's hope for the best !"
"The same problem 2nd day. Tried many times but it shows the same messageEdited: 6:26 am, March 18, 2020 "
I also believe it is a tactic. I had an EasyJet flight cancelled because of C19. They informed me by email. I went the EasyJet site selected refund and received an email immediately confirming the refund.
I have been having the same problem. However when I clicked the refund button today it says that I have no bookings.
"Btw, I just changed two flights (4 tickets in total) 1 month ahead without any fees. They don't charge fee when the flight was cancelled. I still have 2 other flights (Inbound + outboud), but since only back flight (outbound) was cancelled, I couldn't use the inbound flight as well. This is ridiculous, as the inbound flight can't be refunded."
Same problem 2nd day and today i have been waiting for live chat since 7.00 am 4 hours now waiting. They may be swamped but I seriously doubt how much Ryanair is helping us get refunds. Note changing dates works without issues but refunds stuck and no support ?
I think everyone is having the same issue and cannot get a refund - I haven't found anyway around it and cannot contact anyone. I have posted on their facebook page asking for assistance as that will be the only record I have after the cancelled flight has gone and I am left out of pocket
"I applied yesterday for EU261 hoping it will help. Today they answered: ""I regret the cancellation of your flight FR---- from ------- to ------- on the 21-03-2020, which was due to the impact of COVID-19.As this cancellation was unexpected we wish to inform you that no compensation is due under EU261/2004 as this was caused due to extraordinary circumstances beyond Ryanair's control.In the event of a cancellation, the options available are detailed in the EU261 leaflet, as follows:1. Transport on the next available flight on the same route (if assistance has not been provided at the airport - receipted expenses for refreshments and/or accommodation incurred during delay should be submitted to the airline for payment).2. Transport from another Ryanair departure airport or via a Ryanair airport to the original destination (receipted public transport expenses to the new departure airport will be paid by the airline on submission of receipts).3. Full Refund - once this refund option has been accepted, no further liability under EU261 arises.So, still got nothing... I think I'll go to the airport to ask Ryanair's members of staff to help. I've read that some people contacted their helpdesk (and after 40-90 mins) the service solved their problem so now they can get a refund... I can't call at all, the line is dead, so I think it's the only way for me..."
This is definitely a tactic used deliberately by Ryanair not an error or accidental. Its a shame that we have no one to ask for help from. The post was even blocked and removed by admin to keep us quiet. Amazing.
"NO BOOKINGS - NO PROBLEM! hahahah... Sorry, but this whole situation is just ridiculous..."
"If Ryanair don't go bust over this, they have at least lost me as a loyal customer for the last 30 years. Quick to take thousands of pounds from you over 3 decades, but god help you if you ever want a couple of hundred back for a flight they've cancelled. My accommodation with Airbnb was cancelled and the money was in my bank within hours and took 2 clicks. I have never had so much headache simply trying to get a refund for a cancelled flight, of which the money... MY MONEY... is needed to pay for alternative means of travel."
Me too tried to chat with them but all the time busy.
"I sent a request through http://frd.ie/help/?language=en and got an e-mail reply instantly:""Thank you for contacting Ryanair.Please click on the link below which we hope will answer your query.https://www.ryanair.com/ie/questions/can-i-a… ""I don't think it went through. :/Edited: 7:07 am, March 18, 2020 "
Join the club it’s a nightmare
"I am now on a 5th hour wait on their support chat. Automatic refund button not working, form corrupt and chat never connects you to an agent. What else there is to say about Ryanair? If you were to buy a ticket now, no problem!"
I hale the same problem.No contact is avalable.
Having the same issue. It's annoying but likely there overwhelmed. No luck with the chart bot or online customer service and can't get through on the telephone
"I'm in the club, having a lot of tickets, and waiting for Ryanair to get this bug fixed ( optimistic scenary)Meanwhile, Wizz Air considered my flight as departed, I see no money on my wizz account, and don't know what to do in this case, so the problems are everywhere..."
"I filed in a complaint and advise you to do the same. They need to understand that this is ridiculous. I agree with some other peps here that the whole thing looks too dodgy to be accidental. How come they can't fix a simple form validation in so many days? So their developers can code advanced sales platform with many marketing tricks, but cannot do that, huh?"
"I'm still having the same problem , day 2 of trying."
(Your flight reservation number is invalid. Please check the flight reservation number you have entered) Same problems
Hi all Just managed to get a refund - I just kept trying and trying and then hey presto it went through Hang in thereMal
Yes here too. Invalid reservation number ...
here you can contact Ryanair:https://contactform.ryanair.com/index.php
"Have had the same problem for the last two days. Today, I selected 'Flight delayed 3 h' and my refund application has been accepted."
"I have just submitted my complaint form too. I hope that way it will be logged that I have been trying to process the refund request in good time. My wording was as follows ...""Despite receiving notice from YOU that my flight is being cancelled, your system is not allowing me to process the refund request, which I am entitled to. Your system refuses to recognize the reservation number. I have now spent 24 hours on this, which is unacceptable. I wish it to be recorded that I want a refund for my flight and expect it to be honoured ASAP"""
You try getting your money back....
Well done for having the perseverance and the patience! Which part did you keep trying on? Was it the refund page or the refund application form?Jade
"Yes I have tried to contact them on both Facebook, Twitter and the web chat, thanks. Have not received any response at all and I was supposed to fly tomorrow. It’s not really a conspiracy theory if all cancelled flights are unable to get a refund due to the invalidity of their reservation number (which was valid until the flight was cancelled?) and no official statement or support given by RyanAir at all."
"I have had the same problem, but looks as if we can re-book a flight for another time.no good to anyone if ryanair go down the tubes."
"My flight was on the 13th and in the email I received it did say I could claim a refund, but it would not be surprised if they now change this because of the size of the issue, and say I only get a voucher back minus a admin charge :/ I'm really disappointing I can't just get this sorted before they really get overloaded with claims."
"Same here! Filed a complaint here -> https://contactform.ryanair.com/index.phpand got the following reply:""Dear CustomerThank you for your e-mail which we will respond to as soon as possible.Your query has been registered under No: 6508206. Yours sincerely,The Customer Service TeamFor and on Behalf ofRyanair DAC"""
the refund application page - just kept trying
"I have the same problem, anybody have some news ?"
"Wait! Rtanair are not the best to contact unless you are paying hem money, at this time i am guessing their outdated system has crashed and they know about it and are keeping their heads down. Would have been good to see a statement issued to cover all the frustrations of pointless attempts to get our refunds."
"I am having the same problem! Will follow to see if Kathryn has any success in calling them. Hoping its just because the website can't cope, rather than sneaky tactics!"
"once I got through to agent on chatbot, agent refunded my ticket manuallyEdited: 8:50 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Did anyone have an success with Ryanair refund ? Their online system won't work for me either, saying I have invalid booking reference number which is not the case. I have emailed them, no reply"
"Oh great, thanks for info"
"waited 5 hours for chatbot yesterday with no luck. Only waited 15 minutes this morning and agent promptly refunded my money manually. She says I will get it within 14 days and will receive email when it is processed. Thank goodnessEdited: 8:59 am, March 18, 2020 "
I'm having the same issue. Glad I'm not the only one. I tried the customer service chat and asked for a live agent. Was on it for 3 and half hours. No sign of anyone!
"I was informed of a cancellation on the 15thMarch for my flight on the 16th March applied for refund straight away got the money 17th March. However I have another cancellation for the 20th March which I got notification of 19thMarch,I am having the same problems as everyone else I can only assume there is nearly a weeks worth of cancellations so going to be problems. Rather than all the hiccups and lame input excuses it would be nice if they just gave us an explanation."
GUYS SUCCESSi was having the same issue with 'invalid' reservation number but i just kept trying over and over again re-entering captcha and eventually it workedso you just gotta try it several timesgood luck everyone
"Important for me is a re-assurance letter from them promising that this will be resolved. I don't need to have it solved right away, but I do need a proof in my hand - that they owe me this money, especially if this is not resolved after the date of my cancelled flight.Edited: 9:54 am, March 18, 2020 "
I have the same problem and if I go to manage my flight and type the reservation no. then it works.It seams like I can make a new reservation but I will have to pay exstra for the new tickets.
"Guys, what is the AIRLINE CODE? Where do I get it from?"
Hi allDoes anyone know if there's actually any way to get in touch with RyanAir? My flight looks as though its not cancelled (due to fly out 10th April)- but obviously can't travel with the circumstances as they are.
"Same here on two different flights. Ryanair, as with all airlines, are short of cash at the moment so they won't rush to fulfill the legal obligation to consumers."
"To Someone: Airline Code is the two letter code before the airline number, usually it's FR"
"Ryanair have 3 codes. Most common is FR. On the refund page there are 3 options so if your flight code is, for example, FR8513, then select ""Ryanair (FR)"" Then enter your flight number in another box on the refund page."
Ryanair
Having exactly same issue and tried several times from different devices with no luck.
"SOLUTION: guys, just try again and again, you only need to we-write the catcha code, and it will work. It just worked for me after 11 trials."
"Martin, i have the same problem you have. I should have flew on the 25th march but i got an email where they were saying at the end i could refund. But when going to Refund section the systm is not getting my booking reference. Bastards.. they should authomatically accept all this without all this crapt!Y"
"Hello as kindly advised here I had a chat with agent online (waited 45 min in the que) and they will send me refund, but it might take 2-3 weeks as there is huge demand. Good luck everyone."
"Well, I think it's just a matter of your luck! I'm sitting from 3 days re-writing that captcha code over & over & over again and NOTHING. I'm sure I did it a hundred times! And the same... I've been waiting for the agent response yesterday for few hours, and guess what? Today I'm waiting for 1,5 h... STILL :>Edited: 10:39 am, March 18, 2020 "
"i have exact same problem and the phone number doesnt work either, did you get your refund? thanks"
I'm having the same problem
Second day I have the same.
"same here. probably they are overloaded now, but no way they will not reimburs us"
The same . What did you do ?
Yes I am having this problem too. I have 8 bookings that I need to get refunded and all of the ref numbers are coming up invalid which is so frustrating. They are making it impossible to get a refund.
"I've talked to the agent on chatbot (after 2 hours waiting this time).!!!!!!! The agent sended my request to the system so now I don't have to fill the form by myself , I was told, YAY! :> Now I have to wait up to 30 days for a refund, also she/he said I will get an e-mail confirming my request before that (but can't telll when it will be because of the current situation). But I'll get the money FOR SURE and my request is now officially confirmed. So, my advice is... just use this chatbot - it's better than refreshing the form and captcha all the time! Grab a coffee, open the chat window, play your favourite movie or CD and just wait... :) Wish you all luck!!"
"I have the same problem, res number invalid even when I copy and paste it in. Yes I did book on their website, delay tactics I think."
"We are having the same problem, reservation number is „incorrect”."
"Hi, my flight was also cancelled and I'm also trying to get a refund. I'm facing the same problem. Are they purposely trying to avoid us so that they don't give us the refund. Its bizarre. I'll have to tweet this!"
"We are having exactly the same problem, with „incorrect” reservation number."
"#219, I think you are correct. They are swamped. I waited a couple of days to get through to agent through Chatbot. Finally got through today and they manually processed my refund. I must have tried the Refund form over 200 times with no luck though. Just wait for an agent on the Chatbot. Try early in their morning. The hours are posted on the Chatbot page"
"ArghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhI too have input all my correct info. many times with NO luck, reservation number is REJECTED/NOT RECOGNISED.Perhaps we all should AVOID Mr Leary and his airline once this is over,"
"still trying, I am affaird if the date of the flight passes whether I will be able to apply at all.I have two cancelled flights, one on 20/3, second on 24/3. two different bookings and destinations"
"Same story here 'invalid reference number'I checked and all was correct , I tried to call but got a recording saying they were busy. I was supposed to fly to Lanzarote tomorrow (thu) and back on Sunday ........the outbound flight hasn't been cancelled only the return ........... I was told when I called my credit card company that Ryanair had been sending out empty planes so they didn't have to refund ! whether this is true or not who knows !"
Its that slippery bastard O'Leary - doesn't want to give our money back.It's very frustrating and one of the reasons why I've never flown Ryanair until now. Over a 950 euros in flights and car hire likely to be lost.They should hang him...
"I am having the same problem as everyone else, i.e. I get an error message saying that the Flight Reservation Number is incorrect, even though I know it is the correct number. I tried the option of applying for compensation but I got an email from Ryanair stating:""As this cancellation was unexpected and for safety reasons, we wish to inform you that no compensation is due under EU261/2004 as this was caused due to extraordinary circumstances beyond Ryanair's control."""
Yes. I am having the same problem. Has anyone been able to send the refund form without difficulty?
"Lucky you :) we’ve been waiting for 8hrs now, and still no reply on chatbot ."
"Same here. I have three different bookings over the next few weeks. I have received an SMS and email from Ryanair that all three flights have been cancelled but none of the booking reference numbers according to the Ryanair web site is valid. I don't know if they a) have an error on their web site, b) haven't cancelled the flights on their web site yet so it will not process refund requests or c) it is a tactic to not refund customers. Wouldn't it be great if they just sent out an email to everyone explaining what is happening."
Hi I contacted the team and been advised that their website is overloaded and I should keep trying... it's possible to get a refund even after due dates.
Having same problems as everyone. Do 3 transmissions per minute. Insult to injury just received emails from Ryanair advising us of baggage restriction on flights they have cancelled 3 days ago.
"I also tried https://cdn.livechatinc.com/ryanair. The page kept refreshing itself and I managed to finally fill in all my details (I copy/pasted the details about the cancelled flight, so I could fill it rapidly, as it kept disappearing and saying ""Our agents are not available at the moment.""). After waiting about 20 minutes, I spoke to an agent, who manually refunded me. I'm supposed to receive a confirmation e-mail about it and the money back in 28 days. Good luck, everyone!"
what is this page https://accounts.livechatinc.com/… that you refer to? is it contacted to ryanair chatbot?
Get on to this website and log your complaints. Everybody! Do it!!https://www.resolver.co.uk/
Just tried getting a refund and its telling me the same thing
"Just spent another half hour getting invalid number message, then it changed to “ unable to process application at this time, try later”. This seems to indicate that if you get over that first hurdle they are not now processing refunds."
"Re: Ryanair refund- reservation number invalid.I'm having the same problem. Surly Ryanair can explain? or are they trying to pull a fast one??I have tried a number of times (with the right number) to no avail. please Help.Edited: 1:21 pm, March 18, 2020 "
How are you doing? I’m having the same issues today with Ryanair. How did you get around this issue? Thick you
"The same problem here. I think this is one of Ryanair's methods to keep the money for themselves. Has been trying in two days now, hundred of times in different platforms like chrome, Safari, explorer etc. Different languages, different times. And still getting error messages: the flight number is invalid, please fill the captcha, unable to process your application.Then I open chat service https://prod-chatbot.ryanair.com/index.html… and wrote I need a refund. There came automatic answer but i chose no, it was not solved and than chose the last one option that i want to speak with support. Waited in queue for about 20min, than I got a person to help me. Waited again 15-20 min. Than chatted about the issue and thats it. He wrote: I have send the request and it will be refunded within 20 days.So i am crossing fingers i am getting my money back."
"Yea the same here,Tried several times every way possible .But know good."
still happening. wasted an hour. will try again tomorrow
"Hi The same as me show me all time the reservation number Is wrong , we need to send this problem to talk about it in BBC or something like that to get support!!"
"yes I do, no customer service number in function as well"
"https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/one user posted this link, I tried and it worked for me."
Yes it’s happening to me too! I got refunds from EasyJet and vueling so easily with pressing one button but not so with Ryan air. Think they are making hard so people give up!
"251 do you think this is official ryanair? https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/Edited: 3:42 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Hi! Any luck?I'm facing the same issue, and no reply from their support via email and in Facebook."
"Same problem.Flight from Bcn to Seville, marked as 'cancelled'. Pretending to invalidate my reservation number during the fiiling the refund form. Chat doesn't work for hours: 'Please stay connected. You are in a queue for the next available Customer Care agent.'Such a hell!"
Well I’ll just add it’s the same for me. Three sets of flights and none of them working and all giving same error.
I have the same issue.....
Same problem here. Anyone had any luck with the form yet
"Thank you for the link, hopefully it will workEdited: 4:09 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Same problem
Same here :-(
I wouldn't trust that eu261 link as far as I could throw it.It stinks of dodgy opportunism
Just filled out the form that Ryanair sent me and it worked first time - refund processed :)
"""I wouldn't trust that eu261 link as far as I could throw it.""It's a legit Ryanair link but it's pointless to use it as it doesn't allow you to claim a refund. People need to use the dedicated refund page or contact Ryanair customer services.Edited: 4:27 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Given that you can't claim under eu261 because the cancellations will be “extraordinary circumstance” why would Ryanair set up a website with eu261 in the name?
I'm having the same problem. Either saying my reference number is wrong (its not) or that I need to complete the captcha thing (I have)Both flights outbound and inbound flights have been cancelled now too so that isn't what is causing the problems.
I have the same troubles! I am tired to try all the time!
"I managed to contact them via live chat. This is their response:""May I ask you to please be patient and wait a couple more days, and you will be able to fill that form out? Right now our website is dealing with a really high volume of claims, and it needs some time in order to process other requests.Thank you for your patience in advance.A lot of people are trying to do that today, so I would like to ask you to please wait 2-3 days, and I hope that everything will be alright after that period please.""Will try later in a few days."
I think you might be right. I'm having the same invalid reference. I've never had problems with Ryanair before but then this is my first cancelled flight by Ryanair
"""Given that you can't claim under eu261 because the cancellations will be “extraordinary circumstance” why would Ryanair set up a website with eu261 in the name?""The link is not new, it has been around for years. And extraordinary circumstances only affect the right to compensation, there may be other claims under EU261 that are valid."
"Yes, I am experiencing the same difficulty. I suspect this is a typical Ryanair plot to delay giving refunds"
I’m having exactly the same problem - I’m wondering if the website can’t cope with the number of people trying to claim refunds. Or maybe they’re working through the flights and will release them gradually. My flight is booked for 21.3.20 so worried what will happen if I haven’t been able to claim before then. If anyone finds anything out would be great to hear from you.
Did it work calling them?
Thanks for your message. I see that I am not the only one... I am also facing the same problem.
Yes I am having the same trouble now.
Having the same problem!
This is also happening to me. Trying to get through on the live chat is impossible. Will try again early tomorrow.
It is impossible to get any kind of response from Ryanair other than robo useless. I understand they are getting bombarded but airline can still issue some kind of notice to customers that are effected. If they don't respond just dispute on your credit card.
"Both my outbound and inbound flights to/from Poland cancelled.Tried claiming here https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/and claim went through, will try inbound flight.Update: Return flight claim also workedEdited: 5:12 pm, March 18, 2020 "
has anyone resolved the issue of invalid reservation number on ryanair cancellations refund as i have the same problem tonight ?
"280 Mike W, by ""went through"" do you mean you actually got the refund on your card (or bank)?"
Exactly the same problem here!
I'm also facing the same problem. They do this to avoid the refund.
"Exactly same problem - ""invalid reservation number"" even though it is not. This has to be scam to stop people applying for refunds."
"Same here, please let me know if you find out a way to contact them"
Yes and it’s still a problem :(
I thought i was Crazy tiping that number for milion times. I hope you find out the way we can solve the problem
I am in the same position
can you provide IBAN and swift code that you tried?
did anyone get some answer?
Anyone got an answer yet? I've been trying for 2 days and still no joy!!
I got a refund.... what i did was go to bed ... fall asleep and in my dream I went onto thier web site and my reservation number worked .... I then hosted a ryanair reservation refund party in my gaff and but no-one showed up ....
Just wondering any update on the old Ryanair Reservation Refund trick - where they keep saying you have the incorrect reservation number in your refund application
Conspiracy theories... airparks website gave me refund info and date of refund in minutes.Ryanair need to be the ones to chill and get there act in order.
"Unfortunately I don't think it's a system error. I think that the current sitiation is going to send the company under and they are intentionally not honouring the refunds. There's no way that they aren't aware of the 'system error' by now. I, along with a lot of other people, have been trying for 3 days!"
I believe so / same here

Getting the same error even though the reservation number is correct. One thing is that they have lot of claims and that is something I can understand. Another thing is lying and confusing customers to give up trying.
"I also got an email from Ryanair telling me my flight was cancelled and that I would get a refund, however I get the same error as you."
https:/…
"I was also initially getting the invalid reservation number for both my flights, but i tried again at like 1am UK time and success. I refund claim has been filed...but still not email update, its been over 24 hours now, I've also used my proper email, instead of the one Lastminute.com providedAlso I booked with Lastminute.com who redirected me with a link to cancel with ryanair, but its with a random email address Lastminute.com created on my behalf...so I don't know if the email has gone to there or if the refund goes to Lastminute.com first..."
Yes having the exact same problem. Keep saying flight reservation number is wrong when I’m clearly using the one providers in there email. Makes u think is it a delaying tactic on there behalf.
same problem for me
I have just done the same today and get same reason and no help online or web site and telling you not to call them.I have sent BBC News an email. Have your say
"I'm not prepared to take a chance as it might be a scam!!Edited: 7:21 pm, March 18, 2020 "
I'm having the same issue.. My cancelled flight was for this Sunday and I can't apply for a refund apparently due to a wrong reservation number..It really look like a strategy.
I have waited on chat for 12 hours..nothng. Sent in a complaint. My flight was cancelled 2 days ago for flight tonight.  Really is crazy.
I’m having the same issue and I booked my flights on Ryanair App
We are all having the same problem I sent a complaint. Only response I have received. Supposedly they will respond.
Chat is a waste of time
I have the same issue and I booked via the Ryanair App on my phone. Is this just their way to get out of giving a refund? There’s no where this can be reported? Very frustrating!
My flight was cancelled two days ago from Sevilla to lisbon. Flight is tonight.
I got refunds from edreams in 3 days. One travel a nightmare. I have insurance but figure it is more of the same.
Same here!
I sent a request thru complaint department. Tried chat for 2 days...waste of time. At least I have proof I tried.
"After few days of trying I finally managed to complete and receive confirmation of submited refund form. I just kept trying at random times, from both app & browser and it didn't work. Now literally few minutes ago i submited refund forms for both flights from the 1st try.."
"After having the same error message over and over again which says invalid reservation number, I finally managed to successfully submit the refund application form on https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/. It was a terrible nightmare though, I kept filling out the form literally for an hour! I have seen a previous response which says they managed to submit the form around 1am, and weirdly enough my application went through after 1am too. It might be just a coincidence, or more likely it's because it is a very quiet time.. Anyway I find this issue very weird and upsetting. Customers have the right to be at least informed why the issue exists and when it is going to be resolved."
"I dont know if this applies to you, but I realised where it says 'airline code' and then gives you 3 options, I kept clicking RYANAIR(uK), then I thought I would try RYANAIR(FR) and long behold my refund went through! Mistake on my part and I also did it at 2am, hope this helps!"
"Hey everyone. Try doing it at crazy hours, one person did it at 2.36 am and it worked, another one at 4.56 am and it worked for me at 3.22 am!"
"Pop up message says ""Flight has not been cancelled or delayed > 3 hours"" while it is indeed cancelled."
"Guys, I did it. Just now. It is very difficult, but really possible. I tried a thousand times. Yesterday and the day before.And only now it happened! Thank you!My algorithm.1. If you receive ""Your flight reservation number is invalid"", you must clear the cookies.2. After that, you will begin to receive “End with Captcha”.I re-typed this CAPTCHA hundreds times yesterday. But everything was in vain.I woke up specially today earlier and half an hour ago I did it. But yes, it took again about 20 minutes, you have to re-type Captcha code a lot of timeEdited: 12:41 am, March 19, 2020 "
"hi had loads of trouble getting claim form to go through , as would not accept booking ref; , finally gone through at 5 am"
"Monica P, thank you, your site helped me out! For anybody with several bookings like me, try this link https://cdn.livechatinc.com/ryanair it'll report no agent but the page keeps refreshing itself and once filled in your info is saved, just need to click submit again. I tried 20 min and waited another half an hour and managed to speak with an agent who for once manually refunded all my bookings, while with the online form you might need to have luck several times"
Absolutely the same!I hope they won't make trouble later when their system is working.
I confirm. I have exactly the same issue. After sending the refund form I get an error or the information that my flight/reservation number is not valid. This is so annoying.
Yes I think this is deliberate to avoid paying.The same happened to me and friends of ours.I suspect this is happening across the board.Shame on Ryanair
I have also had the same issue has anyone managed to get a refund?
Yes mine is doing this to I booked directly with ryanair any advise please. Iv tried over 20 times this morning flight is on 28th cancelled today.
Yes I’ve been trying for three hours to do the same . Pulling my hair out.
"Hi, have the same problem, but Im not sure if Im typing the correct thing-on my laudamotion itinerary e-mail under reservaton: is combination of letters and numbers, not just six numbers. Should I look somewhere else?"
A PNR is always a combination of letters and number.
I have been using RYANAIR (FR) all the time and it hasn't worked for me. I will try again around 1am and i might be lucky. It's an absulate scandal!
"I have tried to contact ryanair on facebook, chat etc no one cares"
Ah same issue my end.....suspect its deliberate or the cancellation process their end has not caught up
"I have the same issues, but I found out from another forum a there is a way to get your refund and a few people are having success with it now. - Due to overload of their server you should try shortly after midnight- If you get the invalid reservation number code then clear your cookies- if you get the wrong Capra code keep trying until you get through!Some people get through at first try at 3am and some after 15th try at 2am, but it works eventually.I will try myself today and let you know if it worked for me."
"Interestingly the other parts of their web site work very well, book flight, car or hotel.... no issues, just the refund link. That's a real puzzler :-)"
"you need to call this number: 03301007838 (UK). It won't connect first time. You may get ""sorry this number is..."", hang up, call again. It took 93 calls for me to connect. Then a further 1 hour and 27 minutes on hold before I finally got connected with an agent. Took them about 2 minutes to apply the refund which will be placed back into the original payment account within 7 days. I've literally just got off the phone to them. Hopefully this will help someone who is reading this."
i just talked with an agent in live chat. He did the request for the refund and it will take 28 days.
I have the same problem
"HI, thesame here. I cannot change the flight and I cannot get a refund either because the reservation number is wrong. Defenitly Ryanair is using black patterns in UX having a buggy website to avoid giving refunds.Edited: 4:47 am, March 19, 2020 "
Hi everyoneJust to let you know I had the same problem - spotted that someone here had said they tried at 1 am and it worked...I randomly woke up at 1:30am last night and had it a go - and on the third try it went through (ie I didn’t get a message saying the reservation no was incorrect - I got a message confirming receipt of the refund application and that if approved it will be paid within 7 days). It may be worth trying at random times
"PROBLEM SOLVED!Trust me, i had the same problem and i spent 2 days trying to process my refund request trhu the form. The only thing that worked for me was this:1. Go to ChatBot2. Ask you question3. When the rebot respond select ""no"" (it didn't answer you query)4. Select ""i need to speak with support""5. Fill the form and wait for the agentIt took me around 40min of waiting but the agent resolved my issue making the refund of my flights manuallyEdited: 4:55 am, March 19, 2020 "
"@Rocio Mi did exactly the same and it worked!Edited: 4:56 am, March 19, 2020 "
Is it time to spring Joe Duffy and the misery train into action? This would be right up his street - so to speak!
"Blessed Chat Bot! Worked for me too! Currently on hold as a real person is checking my bookings! Thank you, kind strangers!"
Having the same issue!
Hi I am having the same trouble I have tried numerous times but comes back to say my flight reservation number is invalid
"Same issue here, trying for 4 days. No answers via email, Twitter, phone calls, Facebook. Nothing. No response. Internet is exploding with similar comments"
"Has anyone actually been able to get a refund? The same message over and over again ""Your flight reservation number if invalid""............Is is just a case of keep on trying??"
"there are some people they claim they have received but I bet those are bots or ryanair officials, I have checked those profiles and all of them have only a single post. Looks suspicious"
"Yes. Me too. Obstruction at every turn. Fight number invalid even though it is the number that got me into 'my bookings'. Live chat throws up a brick wall about browser settings. Phone line busy so try again later. Blood pressure rising. What next?Edited: 5:37 am, March 19, 2020 "
"are you a both or you are a ryanair worker?Edited: 4:41 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Same issue here...guess it is a tactic.
"Me too, they are also not answering emails and phone line is almost permanent engaged. I got through yesterday to be told I had to complete the form. When I explained the issue I was just told to try again. I did this on the phone and the response was just ""That should work"". I was asked to try again today, now can't get through on phone!"
Guys try live chat. Their agent did the request for me.
"""I have checked those profiles and all of them have only a single post. Looks suspicious""Not really. This thread is at the top of Google searches for 'Ryanair invalid reference' (and similar wordings). That's why we're getting so many first time posters chiming in."
Same here as well. I booked 2 flights so i have to different reservation numbers to claim refund both of them not work. I tried to live chat or call them but nobody replies.
"Hi all,following the advice of another post I tried sending the refund claim early in the morning (6.30am) and it worked. I suppose there's too many people doing it during the day and that's why it doesn't work...this is the link I used:https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/good luck everybody!"
"I tried it via the website's ""EU261 Compensation/Expense Claims"" section at ryanair's ""help center"". (Sorry, I'm completely new here and cannot post links).It allowed me to submit the application for a refund and accepted my flight reservation number without error notice.Apparently this EU261 regulation is also a way of getting refunds for cancelled flights. Hope this helps.."
I am having the exact same problem. Funnily enough I thought I would try to change the flight to see if that works and it recognises my reservation number so looks like a ploy by Ryanair. Have you had any joy? Does anyone know if there is a time limit to get a refund?
Is there any particular trick or way to attract the chatbot? Mine seems kinda shy or on a continuous tea break - any clues? tks bk
Having the same issue. I did write complain to Ryanair on 18.03.2020 and waiting for reply (up to 10 working days). I booked on their site.
Yep same here ! I've sent a message through Facebook and like others will put a reply on if I find out... be careful of ringing any numbers they give you as some are premium rate at £3.60 per minute ...
"Same problem, anyone have update?"
"same problem here, sbd who works for Ryanair told me that they want to avoid that people gets refund, they want people to rebook their flights instead"
"Same problem. Received an email that my flight was cancelled, urgently booked a flight with another airline for 4 days earlier than previewed. Desperately tried to file a claim for the refund and you know what?? they have opened a check-in for my cancelled flight today which is not cancelled anymore. Is it a joke??!!"
I am having the same problem. Ultimately they will have to honour the refund.
Thieves...they just try to avoid the refund...
"Guys i was lucky with the live chat. You have to ""avoid"" the bot so to talk with an agent"
"Same story, and certain it is a tactic: I have three reservations with them and get the ""flight reservation is invalid"" answer with all of them."
"Having the same problem...if somebody will find a sollution, please let us know."
"SUCCESS - I managed to get it to work at 1am after trying a few times. I suspect the servers might be overwhelmed throughout the day, so keep trying during off-peak hours. I used incognito browser, so that might help. The error I kept receiving before it finally worked was the my flight reservation code is invalid."
""".if somebody will find a sollution, please let us know.""Available solutions have already been posted mulitple times. Keep trying (ideally at odd hours with fewer customers trying to get through) or contact Ryanair customer services.Edited: 6:51 am, March 19, 2020 "
Same here - have been trying to submit refund request for two days now. No luck.
I am having the same issue !
I’m having the same problem. Flight has been cancelled. When filling the form in keeps telling me it’s an invalid booking reference number. I know I've entered it correctly. So frustrating. Haven’t received any emails from them either. I fear that if this goes on after the departure date I may not get anything.
Did you have any luck? We’ve got the same issue and can’t get though on the phone
"Can anyone advise does the refund have to be applied for before the date of the cancelled flight?I have tried several times to apply for the refund and get the invalid reference number error. Have cleared cookies, tried different devices etc. I have also tried to claim as one way and also return, I was due to fly home on Saturday 21st and did not take my outbound flight.Thanks for any advice offered."

"Im having the same problem. Flight cancelled and offered refund. But when filling form in keeps telling me I’ve entered an invalid booking ref number, when I haven’t. I booked this on the Ryanair app. I fear that if this isn’t resolved before the departure date, I will get nothing."

"Hi Rocio, thanks for your solution. I tried the same I got stuck after I select"" I need to speak with suport"" Seems it doesn't work with Safari Browser. Changed to Chrome and everything is fine"
Has anyone managed to get through to customer care?
I can see they have disabled the refund option in the app & online in your ryanair account. this combined with an online form page which isnt correctly linked to anyones book is a load of crap. get your act together.
Thank you for this great advice!
"""I fear that if this isn’t resolved before the departure date, I will get nothing.""There's no reason to fear that. Your entitlement to a refund remains the same after your departure date.."
"ryanair will be bankrupt soon and we the tax payer will bail them out so in the mean time they are stealing our money, we will not get our money back they are ruthless"
"Thanks that worked for me, or at least it allowed me to request the refund, we'll see what happens"
I'm having the same problem. Any solution yet?
"Hello, Are there any news? I have same problem?"
They are professional scammers. Same problem here they should be suited.
May be somebody know there are we should writing or calling in government branch/servis/structure/office in this case?
Yes definitely a tactic not to refund! I am getting the same message. Tried ringing 3 numbers but all engaged. They want you to rebook but goodness knows when and probably same thing will hapen!! nightmare.
Same problem flight from Lviv to Warsaw on 20MAR2020
Same problem here. Does anyone know how long it's possible to get a refund?
"""Does anyone know how long it's possible to get a refund?""There is no deadline as such."
Will they still honour refund even after departure date/time of cancelled flight ?
"If anyone manages to get through this problem, LET US KNOW! I am in the same situationEdited: 8:16 am, March 19, 2020 "
"""If anyone manages to get through this problem, LET US KNOW!""If you read the thread (or even just the last 3-4 pages) you'll find that several people already have."
They don't have a problem taking our moneyes when we book
"Same problem for me also. Don't worry though, you will be reimbursed eventually, they aren't crooks. The issue is likely to be technical, brought on by an overworked, under pressure team and passengers trying to get their money back simultaneously."
"I finally got it working and I've been trying HUNDREDS of times!!Late last night there was an update for the iOS app, so I updated it and tried again. It came up with a brand new error, but after choosing ""YES"" to fill in the form YET AGAIN, it finally went through! YAY!https:/…"
Same here. I booked through the site and there is nothing wrong with the number I am entering. Must be a bug at their end
"Hi,On the laptop i had the same issue. But on the phone it worked from the 1 attempt.At least now the form went through, but no confirmation email from ryanair yet."
I'm quite confident Ryanair won't be going into administration any time soon. They have tons of money.
"Hi everyone,I just filled in the form twice (for two cancelled flights) on this page: https:/…index.php Yesterday it stuck when I entered the reservation number, but today I got through the end. They should connect me within 10 days, as they say. Hope it will work."
I think exactly the same
"""I just filled in the form twice (for two cancelled flights) on this page: https:/…index.php""I don't know why people keep posting links to that form. It is NOT a refund form, it is a form to claim EU261 compensation and expenses."
"Great shout, I followed what you actioned and it seems to have accepted my claim"
"As it seems to be the only form that works, perhaps they will kick Ryanair into fixing their website!"
"on Monday I was able to request a refund with couple of clicks, just click the link in the email, press the refund button and everything sorted.Yesterday I wanted to refund another one just cancelled flight and found that now this refund button links to a broken form where my reservation id copied from their email is ""invalid""I can't see any reason for this change in their interface other that stopping users from requesting refund in a fraudulent and truly pathetic way.They had a nice interface before and suddenly they've replaced it with a nuisance form where we are forced to paste information provided by them to their broken webform.It would be more decent to say that they are not able to refund us at the moment instead of introducing this dirty trick with the form and causing frustration on top of disappointment.It's simply a fraud and I can't believe that it's an accidental bug, this change doesn't make any sense, also I don't think that this scam O'Leary haven't approved thisEdited: 8:49 am, March 19, 2020 "
I tried for several times and now I am receiving a message that there has already been registered a submission for refund. Should I expect a copy/receipt of this submission on mail?
"A miracle... After exactly 43 calls, I was put in the waiting cue and after 1 hour 17 minutes waiting, I spoke to Customer Care and she filed the refund. Should receive confirmation within 24hrs, and money back within 28 days....."
@Houwing V can you let me have the phone number for Customer Care as I can't find it anywhere. I've been trying to apply for my refund online since yesterday evening and just get the same as everyone else saying the reservation number is invalid. Well done for persevering with 43 calls!
Still trying and clearing cookies and cache makes no difference. The form is being submitted as it picks up errors with other fields but the message re reservation number is either bad programming or something more cynical. Surely not?
"They don't answer on the phone, the line is always busy, when you reach and wait, they just turn you down. Cant call again, the line is busy. No contact. Via website, all errors, reservation nr. wrong - AVOIDANCE OF ISSUING REFUNDS100% tactic"
We are having the same issue here. Tried on two different machines and a mobile. Seems Ryanair disabled it from their side...
"Yes, been trying all morning to speak with Ryanair and no response."
The app is now down ..l
Same issue. Useless arsewipes. Hope they go under.
"Ain't no conspiracy, they ain't trying to give people money back straight away, thats a big pay out for them so they will unfortunately fortunately have website problems to delay all the payouts at once, I could do with my holiday money back for resources in these uncertain times"
I get this too and there is no way to contact Ryanair to get this resolved! Appreciate the challenges that everyone is under right now. The challenge here is the systems were probably not designed for the current level of demand. I hope they get to fixing this issue soon so that we can all get our refunds processed.
"Hi, Just got a text to urgently check my email re my flight details. No Email ?? What is going on?????????????"
conspiracy theory? are you idiot? they refuse to refund and their links don't work. What do you think genius?
"I've been waiting on the online chat now for over 5 hours, bloody joke!"
I know exactly how you feel and it most certainly is not a joke.This should be on the news/radio/tv/ etc.
I presume they're just snowed under and customer service was never their strong suit!
Been trying to get a refund for days now. This is a joke really.
I have same problem
I am having the same issue
"Post 430Highly offensive response from a keyboard warriorUtterly pointless please dont comment further The poster is obviously worried about recovering moneyEdited: 11:38 am, March 19, 2020 "
"We tried over and over to get the online form to work, this probably making the issue worse. Eventually got through on the phone line, after several attempts where we were told the number was not recognised or getting through and then being cut off once making the selection to speak to someone. Once we spoke to someone, the cancellation was resolved within a minute. I think the website and phone lines are simply overwhelmed. No conspiracy to keep the money.My daughter was due to go to Rhodes at the end of March, but the flight doesn't seem to have been cancelled yet. I am expecting her to get an email soon. The website says that from 24 March all Ryanair flights are expected to be grounded. https:/…UPDATE-WED-18-MARWe all have to be patient, even with Ryanair."
I am getting the same message but I am putting I the reservations correctly and have done so many times
yes the same here.....
"Get proof/photos of what Ryanair screens are showing when trying to get refund, so at least you have evidence to provide to your Insurers at a later date that you tried to get a refund from the airline. My insurance smallprint says I will require PROOF of trying to obtain refund from the airline.... make sure the DATE is on the photo of the screen aswell so the Insurers cant say you didnt try in time"
"Having the exact problem,we are to fly on the 23rd but unable to proceed"
I am having the same problem. I booked directly through the Ryanair website. It's insane!
"Hi, I have the same problem. My flight to UK this weekend was cancelled and the refund form keeps telling me that my Reservation Number is invalid! Also the customer service call keeps dropping.I have sent them a message via FB messenger with my full flight details and I'm waiting on a reply.I have also kept a screenshot of the refund error too."
I'm having the same issue too. Just tried. If you could update us that would be great :-) thanks!
"Did yuo get this sorted? I am having exactly the same issue. This is a daylight robbery.Edited: 12:09 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"I had my Original booking flight cancelled ,then re booked for a flight 10 days later and was charged Price difference ,then 24 hrs after i paid n booked the new flight i received an Email saying this was now Cancelled ????I tried to get a Refund but had same problem re Ref Booking which was Correct ,they will not answer to Blog chat on website either its very bad Customer Service i was offered another Flight 5 Days later and now this is Cancelled luckily i did not re book this one !!its a Scam"
I keep calling the customer service line and got through to the bit were you ask to speak to someone and then the line cut.
Any luck?
Yep same here .. tried calling till I.get Cut off .. sent emails so many times that they should be sick of me .. not even being acknowledgement!!!!! Frustrated doesn’t even cut it as I’m having the same problem getting through to my travel insurers Halifax with AXA !!!!!!!
"Just got through to Ryanair Customer Services !! Tel. 0330 1007 838 & just keep trying, press option 6 when connected & wait in queue while musics playng - the staff are trying their best - we're getting our full refund for outward & return flights inclusing priority etc. Well done Ryanair. Good luck everyone"
I has the same issue and finally tried using the EU261 compensation form athttps:/…I entered all the same flight details and it seemed to work. At least it said they were reviewing my claim and would contact be in < 10 days.
"Hi everyone! I have faced the same issue today but was able to request help through a live chat. So Ryanair's assistant could file a refund application for me. Still waiting for confirmation, but I believe you could try that too. Here's a link: https:/…contact-us"
"Same thing for me but with a ghastly twist. One hour before the checking in time (over an hour's drive away) got a text saying the flight had been re-instated. This means I effectively become a ""no show"" and therefore no refunds due.Ryan air really are B****s aren't they?"
"Is there anything we can do?Edited: 12:39 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Thanks to posts 435 and 434, I've tried to do the same - fingers crossed!"
really -chill out when you could lose £600 mmm ok
The Sun reports this reinstatement situation but Ryan air claims they are just repatriation flights. In other words if we still went to our UK airport to go to France we would probably not be able to get back. Maybe Ryanair aren't so bad after all.
Read their twitter account thousands complaining about not being able to get a refund or even able to contact them they are just ignoring their customers
"It did take a lot of perseverance but I did manage to get through on the Live Chat evenutually, the challenge was filling out the initial question fields as the page only seemed to let me enter one character at a time every 30 seconds or so. Had to press the Start ""Chat"" button about 50 times before it did connect, once I got in the queue I was dealt with within 15 minutes and they have processed the refund manually. So it is possible, albeit one hell of a challenge. Good luck everyone and stay safe."
"I have had the same problem with the refund page on their website. Ryanair have waited until the last minute to cancel my flight, in the hope I will re-book somewhere else. Now they've cancelled the flight, the ploy now is to get the website to give a message saying the reservation number is invalid. They are the most unscrupulous company, with horrendous customer service, and deserve to go out of business. How short sighted of them not to realise that tactics like these will mean customers like me who book at least twice a year with them will go elesewhere. I dont even care if it costs more, I will never book with Ryanair ever again."
"Hi all.There is a solution, not easy, but a solution. Connect to this, ideally very early in the morning and leave this chat open, at least it shows how much time you have to wait: https:/…I have connected to the chat 9am, got connected to the agent after 5hours, but when I got connected, the agent sorted out and manually instructed the refund in the system. It will take a few days to receive an email on that and a further 28days to get a refund...Not the best, but better then something. I hope you find this useful all !"
An alternative route is to submit a claim under EU 261 using the link on the RyanAir site belowhttps:/…At least it gets registered! They say it can take 10 days to process the claim.
Hi yes I have been trying all day and getting the same message..
I had success. I did on my iPhone and just kept re entering the Captcha. I did it around 10 times and it worked!!
"And I thought it was me who was having the problems until I found this thread.Tried the live chat and immediately told me ""no agents available"". Then it altered to someone will be with you in 202 minutes!!!!"
I agree it has to be on purpose I've sane issue
"Me and my friends have faced the same issue,I have found online petition for this: https:/…I hope together we will get it!Edited: 2:27 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Same thing happening: ""Unfortunately we cannot process your application for one of the following reasons:Your flight reservation number is invalid. Please check the flight reservation number you have entered"""
I think it is far more likely to. E a technical resilience issue (can’t handle the volume of folk trying to access the site at the same time) than a deliberate ploy to avoid paying refunds.However you’re welcome to stick to your conspiracy theory of you want.
"Yes I get the same messageUnsurprisingly, I suspect their web site can't handle the volume of people that are trying to get the refunds.I'm trying the chat, which says I have a wait time of 193 minutes. So I'm guessing by that time there will be nobody monitoring the chat, They also say ""thank you for your patience""."
"Having the same issue, flight cancelled, on the refund form, nit recognizing my reservation number, has anybody had any success as yet?"
"Guys, I am following this conversation since the very beginning, so the problem was the same. I did (at least) 200 of attempts in 4 days and it finally works!!!Good luck everyone! ,"
Same problem this seems like a ploy
"I am having the same problem - I have tried many times and it keeps telling me invalid reservation number. Also, sometimes when I click ""Get Refund"" under My Bookings it just takes me to the main website page and I have to go back into my account again."
For those of you who succeed. do you receive a confirmation on e-mail or on screen?
This link is working https:/…
no - that new link isnt working either. Stuck at page 1 of 5 ...
I am having the exact same issue!!!
"No, It is not working. I am stuck in the 1st step"
"""No, It is not working. I am stuck in the 1st step""It's not the correct link anyway. Don't know why people keep posting it."
"I m having exact same issue, i've filled out thr refund form about 15 times now but keeps telling me reservation number invalid. I have also tried to reach the chatbot but they're not available. Do you know a phoneline?"
Did the partial refund work for the one flight?
"Hi I am getting the same, highly annoying and making me wonder if we will get a refund"
"Thanks for that tip, I've now processed my refund request, now know what an IBAN and BIC is!!Best wishesEdited: 4:28 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"I have three cancelled reservations and so far none of them went through the refund form for the same reason (""invalid reservation number""). But! I just received SECOND mail regarding my middle reservation titled ""Important Information Regarding your Ryanair Flight XXXXXX"". The whole e-mail is identical as the first one from yesterday but this time the refund link is a lot longer AND WORKING. I hope they will send me second e-mails to my other two reservations as well. I can't use this working link to apply for refund for any other reservation because sadly ""flight reservation number"" field is not editable. After sending the form I could download a PDF file as a confirmation of sending my refund request. Good luck guys, maybe we're gonna succeed with this! Check your e-mails"
"That form doesn't seem to work and everyone getting the message that the reservation number is invalid. Try the Ryanair EU261 Compensation and Expenses refund form, link is on one of the posts on here. I just did it and it worked. Need to access your IBAN and BIC code from your bank, google how to find them if you don't know. We'll see if it worked in a few weeks I guess."
God Bless you man. I've tried 124589652 times and never worked because it was saying the booking number was wrong (WTF!!).
Get it before they go bust. Try their customer service line 0330 100 7838 found this on mse forum. Will try mine tomorrow
Hey! I've had the same problem. So I've found the way how to get a refund.https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/This form helped me to get my money back :) Hope my information wil help you)
HiWe used this linkhttp://frd.ie/help/?language=nlA day o two later they sent a link to email which worked!!!Good luck!
Same problem invalid flight ref been trying ages.Just emailed watchdog.Can't believe this isn't intentional' how many people just give up and let em keep the fifty quid or whatever
"I'm having the same issue with an incorrect reservation number despite copy and pasting it from the booking on their website.I even tried to do a live chat with them but after an hour of waiting gave up.@LeyLand10, this has nothing to do with them being snowed under, this is an automated system which has a fault, accidental or planned is anyones guess?"
not good for uk as only accepts iban and swift codes
Every UK bank account has an IBAN but it's not the link to use anyway as has been mentioned many times so it's a moot point.
Hi all. Had the same issue with an invalid reservation number. Contacted them via their live chat. selected an option to speak to the actual customer service. Was put in a queue. After around 20 minutes one of their customer service people answered and my refund was processed. They said it will take around 7 to 10 days to receive the money back. I literally chatted to them 10 minutes ago. Hope this helps!
"POSSIBLE SOLUTION: If you wait for the email from Ryanair and follow the link they send, it takes you to a simpler form which doesn't give the validation error and (seems to) processes the refund without hassle. (Fingers crossed...)"
Ive just this minute been sent an email from Ryanair!I clicked on the refund link and confirmed I wanted a refund for all passengers on my booking and it worked ! Hope you all receive this email.
"I have the same problem! I am trying over and over!I want my 490 euro back!!!!!I am going to make a claim on the Online Dispute EU Commission@Ryaniar I don't care if you are going to fail, just give me the refund!"
"So - here it goes.None of the links posted on here work.But it turns out (in my case) I was trying the refund too soon ... only the first leg of my trip was cancelled.Second leg (return flight) got cancelled today and that's when I also got a new email from Ryan titled : ""Important Information Regarding your Ryanair Flight ""Then there was a long (custom) link in that email leading to a personalised (small) form (smaller than the other ones) ... after 1 try it went through and was able to cancel both legs."
I got same problem
"For me was same issue with invalid reservation number which is bshit.Instead I went to suggested https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/ and it workedSome things to consider:1) You have to make a separate request for the to and return flights, cannot claim both at the same request2) Says that customer support will contact within 10 days so will take quite some time...3) Latvian IBAN and SWIFT/BIC codes were not accepted, Belgian worked (damnit Ryanair...)"
"I have exactly the same issue. And I have 8 separate tickets, which I can't refund. However, for one of them I've recently received another email from Ryanair with a bit different link to a separate form to refund. I have filed it out and it went well! It said that once approved, it will be processed within 7 days!Waiting for another emails!"
"We Face tha same problem, has anyone Foundation the answer"
"Same problem just tried for ages to get 2 separate refunds .Keeps coming up invalid reservation number ,I know they both ard vorrecg ad hard bordingmpassex on my phone next to me"
I am having the same issues for 2 flights I need refunds for.
So do you think it only works when both directions are canceled?
Any luck with finding a way to submit 'valid'ref number. I am having the same problem.Many thanks
I have used this form and after 2 days received e-mail with the link with pre-printed the same reservation number and it works.
Yes identical. Now my reservation and flight has disappeared completlyAnd no email.
"Thanks, this worked :)"
"I was struggling for ages, kept on trying over and over again, and then it went to a different page which said that I wasn't able to submit it at that time. When I tried again later it says that ""A previous application has already been submitted for this booking."", but I haven't received any confirmation of the refund and on MyBookings it still shows the details of my flights and that I can apply for a refund. Any ideas if it's gone through or not?"
"So i finally managed to get a refund, this is how i did it:https:/… I did all of this on my laptop on google chrome. I opened the above link in a new tab page, and there i filled in all the details on page 1. Once i clicked 'continue' nothing happend, i could not continue to the next page.Then: i clicked the link above again, so the same page opened on another tab (i left the previous tab still open). When that 2nd tab opened, I was immediately on page 2 of the form. From there I could continue it all the way to the end and could finish the form. Hope this works for you all also, good luck!"
"@Mark P, thanks for the suggestion. Finally I was able to submit. Instead of logging into Ryanair and select cancel from there, just follow their cancellation link in mail. Takes you to a different location which actually is simpler and works!!"
"Hi, it gives a different link when u finally get the email, and request finally went through fine...had same initial problem"
"I have two flights to refund.I received an email for one with a link with the reservation number prefilled, and this form worked successfully. I'm still awaiting an email for the other flight.I think Ryanair have just gone into meltdown and there's a big queue as they might be processing refunds manually."
My flight today cancelled. I started at 2.30 this afternoon attempting to complete the refund application form and I am still trying and it is 22.05. Experiencing same problem as yourself or asking me to repeatedly attempt the captcha code. Is this because the system is overloaded with people trying to get a refund or is there a fault?
Thank God it’s not just me. It’s driving me mad as I know it’s the right reservation number!
Thank god it’s not just me. It’s driving me mad when I know it’s the right reservation number.
"I have now successfully applied for a refund. I looked at My Bookings on the website 2 days ago and my outward flight only was cancelled. I looked again last night and both flights were cancelled. I tried asking for a refund from My Bookings tonight and had exactly the same problem many people have been reporting on this thread. Then tonight I got a text and an email informing me of the flight cancellations (over 24 hours after the cancellation of both flights). The mail contained a link to apply for a refund. Using this link took me to a different form, and this time my application worked straight away! So it seems that if you wait for your email and use the link in it, you’ll be fine. Hope this helps."
"Hi I have been having the same problem since Sunday. Flight was supposed to be 28th March. Even tried the webchat several times, never get a reply and the phone always gets to a certain point then cuts off. It is very frustrating."
Hi I am having the same problem
That’s great Thanks for letting us know
"Seems that your application has been proceeded and you won't be able to fill the refund form again, system will tell you that you already did it. I filled the form 6 days ago (March 14-th), didn't receive anything on email or any notification but managed to download Refund Application Form. Now waiting for any approval and refund, my reservation completely disappeared from My Bookings. By the way, I also struggled to fill the form, there was the same error about invalid reservation number. Then I realized that I didn't pick the right airline code (mine was FR, not OE or another one) . Once I picked the right one it worked."
I've got the same problem so have gone to Paypal and started a case to get money back.
Clicking on 'REFUND' on cancellation email takes you to form eventually but still same message about reservation number being incorrect which is not the case. Have tried FR and Ryanair UK for airline choice but still not working.
"It happened the same to me at the beginning, but then I managed to submit my request.After some hours of receiving an SMS of Ryanir, they sent me an email in which they offered me to get a refund or to change the flight,The refund information was followed by a link that redirected me to their website's refund window, this time with my reservation number already writen. I filled the rest of the fields, and got through the whole process.Hope you will be able to do it, too."
"Although I could see on my Ryanair app that my flight was cancelled, I like all of you couldn’t process my refund as it was saying that my reservation number was wrong. Tonight I received an email from Ryanair telling me the flight was cancelled and with a link to process either a refund or change flights. I clicked on that and it opened a web screen and I was able to process my refund straight away and then next screen confirmed I was successful and that the refund will be processed in the next 7 days. Result!"
"I have 4 flight to get refunded, one of them meant to fligh this morning. Tried it all Follow the link via email and throught website and Ryanair app..nope it doesn't work. Apparently all my booking references are incorrect. I guess they are very very busy. There will be some very worried staff in Ryanair company the now"

Having the same issue also
Does it pre populate with your reservation number? If not could you possibly send me the link to give it a try? Thanks
Yes I have the same problem
"I have waited up until 1:30am and have successfully managed to apply for a refund. I'd recommend staying up to complete it. I got sent an email with a link to a different form that before and it worked first time. I am now awaiting confirmation of the application and a refund within 7 days. Fingers crossed it works for all of you!Edited: 9:33 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Your not gonna get the refund at all guys. And if you get it it will be after months/years of dispute. My recommendation is try to change the destination and/or date for a similar/lower price.
"I’ve the same issue ,been trying for days to get a refund ,I was due to fly out to Spain on the 18th ,,online refund system says invalid reservation number ,,very frustrating ,,customer service impossible to get hold of"
"I was due to fly out to Spain on the 18th,,same problem as everyone else,,online refund system says invalid reservation number,been trying for days now ,,very frustrating,,,customer service is impossible to get hold of ,"
"Yes same for me, typical Ryanair they're going to throw every obstacle in your way when they are obliged to refund you. My flight was not available for new bookings since last week (i.e. they'd already decided to cancel it) but didn't inform me the passenger until last minute so that I might change to a different flight in the meantime. Despicable abuse of customers, hope they go bust!"
"I have just managed to apply successfully for 3 refunds in row in first try right now using https://refundclaims.ryanair.comNone of my yesterday attempts was successful. It looks like their system is not overloaded right now.Edited: 11:38 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"After a few days of attempts, I managed to submit my refund request today. Their system is overloaded indeed as well as their support.

"It just worked for me. I tried it at 5am in the morning, while it was quiet.Their refund system isn't used to the demand and is timing out under the demand. Increasing capacity isn't trivial and not a priority it would seem ;-)"
Just worked for me too at 5am after several days of trying. I logged into my Ryanair account and accessed the refund page from there rather than the via the cancellation email. I have taken screenshots of every failure over the past few days and of the successful attempt.
"Hey, guys!Tried to do this at 4AM and it worked for me (also tried at 1AM and nothing). :)"
"I submitted mine at 5.30am, and after two attempts it went through. I think there system is overloaded during the day and evening, so set your alarm like I did!"
Hi everyone.|I confirm that the trick of filling the form in ODD hours works.I tried at 6.30AM GMT+1 and worked right away.Form:https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/?
I'm still getting the errror message with invalid reservation number
I am having the sams issue. I even tried copy and pasting my reservation number instead of typing it because at a point I thought I am going crazy and misreading a digit. But still no use! This is getting frustrating.
After numerous attempts in the evening and even tried at 1.30am with no luck. SUCCESS! I finally got it submitted at 5.30am.
Hi I am also having the same problem don't know what to advise as have also been trying to contact Ryanair for days now with no success. The whole process is very frustrating I think they are hoping we give up so they don't have to pay up. But I personally will keep trying.
"I have some update about the cancellation process.I knew the flight was cancelled 2 days ago while I saw it in Ryanair mybooking dashboard. By clicking, “refund”, I experienced “invalid” flight number like everyone. Of course, I gave up in the end after hundreds times trying.( up to this moment no email from Ryanair about cancellation)My flight is due to fly this evening 17:00, and I received an email at 7:00 about the cancellation. The hyperlink in the mail leads me to a different form where reservation number has been pre-set. I only need to make one tick and submit. It confirms the refund will be done in 5-7 days.So.. you may give it more patience and wait for Ryanair cancellation email. Good luck everyone !"
I have been trying to get a refund for 5 days now. I’ve consistently been getting the Flight reference error. I tried this morning at 3am WORKED A CHARM. Formed filled and accepted in 20 seconds. Hope this helps some of you. Good luck and stay safe out there
I am having exactly the same problem. I am trying to call them now. Let's see.
"Some of the most recent emails from Ryanair have a unique link included for processing a refund for that specific reservation number. That link took me to a unique refund form I hadn't seen before. If you still need to reach Ryanair (which I do for older cancellation emails that don't include that unique link) I would recommend Twitter or waiting. The app and website are not working and with so many posts on this thread alone, the company must be going through hell right now. I'm honestly proud of Ryanair for at least offering to refund these flights! They are doing much better than other airlines I'm wrestling with right now!!"
The same just an hour trying to input for refund
"Hi guys, I had the same problem but today they have sent me another email with different link in it and this time it worked. Good luck to you all!"
"I still keep trying, but it is still not working. Can please someone advise what to do? The phones are constantly engaged, there is no way of contacting them. I am afraid that there is a deadline until when I may request full refund - does anyone know please?"
"I find it very unprofessional from them knowing that their stuff does not work, they cut all communication! Very unprofessional! One simple sentence in the e-mail on the web or media would suffice at these difficult times:""All of you that request refund or change of flight please wait, we will get back to you when the worst crisis is over. Right now we are working hard to care for those that were left behind in foreign countries.""HELL YEAH, I JUST MADE THIS UP - IT TOOK ME 1 MIUTE - WHY DON'T THEY REASSURE US THAT OUR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE INVALID WITH PASSING DAYS?!"
Same issue for me it’s getting beyond a joke now they know their system is not working and using it as an excuse to keep our money!
I have cancelled flights on two different bookings numbers and have tried in daylight and during the night following the link from the email as well as logging onto my account. All attempts to claim the refund have failed.The outbound leg of the flights on the bookings still flew on Monday 16th and Wednesday 18th March.My elderly mother and father in law were booked to fly back on Sunday 22nd March and their flight has been cancelled with no other option to get back home with Ryanair. They tried to transfer to today and there were no seats left on the plane even though it was being advertised as available. They flew to Spain before any these events were predicted. Luckily I have managed to book them on a jet2 flight today at their own cost. Shame on Ryanair for how they are dealing with this crisis and abandoning their customers in a lock downed Spain.
I have flights booked for 14th April to Valencia and then to Alicante on 13th May with Ryanair.  How long should I wait before making contact regarding a refunds?Thanks.
"They will notify you about cancellation via e-mail and offer few options. THE OPTION TO REFUND WILL BE PROMISED, BUT IT WILL NOT WORK like for the rest of us. Good luck!"
"""How long should I wait before making contact regarding a refunds?""Have your flights been cancelled? If not, you'll need to wait for that."
Same here. Much time spent trying to input the res. number and all I get is that is that it is unrecognised.
"have you tried to book intead of refund, suddently all prices are more expensive than if you buy without rebooking...hmm all is about not paying anything back"
# 561 if only Ryanair were working hard to care for those left behind in foreign countries. I agree it needs a statement from Ryanair to reassure their customers but I'm afraid as I have stated in #563 there has been no care shown to my in laws still in Spain.
Ryanair is resending email regarding cancelled flights with a new working link for a refund.Keep your eyes peeled.
Ryan air have cancelled my flights but their system for refunding me the money asks for a flight reservation number which I entered many times and they keep rejecting it. This must be their way of keeping our money and pretending that its our fault.Its a con!!!
"Lexexpress. Thanks, flights not yet cancelled. Just getting very anxious about the posts on TA and the prospect of not getting my money refunded. S1."
"Don't worry, you'll get a refund but not until your flights have been cancelled."
Please stop spamming the forums with your silly facebook group.
Ryanair are sending out a new email with a working link.I had two emails yesterday for two bookings and both worked.I think they are just in meltdown so its taking time to contact everyone.
HiDid you get sorted?Same problem here
Hi I'm having the same problem and when trying to call lines are busy any advide?
"Don't know what the deleted post re Facebook is about but have read numerous reports on FB re people being successful at 3 am etc.Others have switched to a different ""G"" system. Whatever I am still being rejected and same excuse!"
Yes. Got that problem this morning. They are obviously playing delay tactics!!
"Hi everyone, I also had this problem when submitting the refund application- it would say my flight reservation was invalid. However, I think you have to wait for an email from Ryanair. In the email is a link to a refund page with the flight reservation number already automatically added- so you don't need to add it in. The you just have to fill out name etc as usual and when you press submit it actually works.So I would say wait for an email from them and then follow the link in the email as opposed to going to the website yourself and inputting all of your details.I hope that helps!"
"I have been trying to claim refund this morning. Nonsense keeps coming up about the reservation no being incorrect. I understand that they are probably overwhelmed, but I expect the refund claim form to be working correctly, not this nonsense."
"I finally had luck at 5AM (3AM UTC) this morning. After reading that a few people managed to get through late at night I got up at 3AM and had been reentering the captcha since about 3:15. I had two separate flights cancelled and was really lucky to get the second application accepted at the first try. Maybe it really has something to do with the system overload.Edited: 5:18 am, March 20, 2020 "
"***Got the email with a link with my booking number pre-populated this morning for a flight in a weeks time. ***If anyone else got their email for flights departing in exactly a weeks time then that may be the approach they're taking, would've been nice to know before attempting that form so many times and the stress!"
"I just received a second cancellation email with a link, which actually worked. I think they are trying to manage refunds so that they do not get snowed under with everybody applying at the same time. So be patient, my flight was not until 28th March and the email with the right link arrived this morning."
Lucky you. I have received no email - just found the note regarding cancelled flight on the app and website. Still been trying with the form this morning.
"Hi , did you managed do refund? I’m still having the same infinity, invalid booking reference"
"Hi , did you managed go through refund process, I still having the same info , invalid reference nr"
"Monika, see post 583."
"Yep me to, had email from Ryanair to apply for refund or rebook at a later date due to current situation. The form will not accept the Booking reservation number."
"Kevin, please refer to post 583."
Would you like to refund my poor Mothers ticket ???
Still happening today
Just wondering why the press are not reporting this scam by ryanair
"I am having the same problem . The reservation code is rejected every time. I know Ryanair must be very busy but why not make a public announcement to that fact and say all claims will be met no matter how long it takes. At least we would know they are acknowledging the problem. Come on Michael O'leary , save your reputation."
The same for us. We have 4 cancelled flights with 4 different reservation numbers. Ryanair says all 4 is invalid.
See post 583.
"Same here, all they are offering is to reschedule the same trip. Due to covid19 not possible. Should be an easy refund or credit for us to use anywhere with ryanair, €450 ticket price"
"Same here, got the email, clicked on the link, redirected to the ryanair login page, so i had to look for the refund link in there, which didn't work. I read about people getting their refunds very late at night/early in the morning, I might try to do the same, as now I have 2 return flights cancelled for a total of 1000 euro."
"Yes, I have flights booked 1 week apart, both cancelled, both offer a refund, both say invalid number. Ryanair RUBBISH"
I have the same issue.
I got the cancellation email but the link opens ryanair home page and not the page with the refund!
Same here it's a joke been waiting for an agent forever. I'm going to email them to tell them of the problem
Just read post 583.
"Yes and its been the same for me for 3 days. I am using the correct booking reference which is the same one Ryanair quoted when they cancelled my flight yet the automated refund system constantly says i am using an invalid booking reference. It cant be, it is the same one i used to get boarding pass. Its impossible to contact Ryanair by any means. Its an absolute disgrace."
"Guys. Today got an email with personated individual link from RyanAir to enter the refund details.It is almost the same application form with less details. Hold on, everything is coming back.Stay safe"
"I am in the same situation.I filled a general contact form stating that I wish to receive a refund and Ryanair due to their system incapability is failing to acknowledge my request. This is just in case my cancelled flight date is missed before the refund is processed and I could not be entitled to receiving my money back.https://contactform.ryanair.com/Cheers,M"
"hi all, it took a few days (during which i was also unsuccessful in getting the refund form to work from the main site), but then i got a text saying to check my email and a few hours later I got an email about the cancellation from Ryanair. The email had a link to a refund submission form and that went through without a hitch. (now waiting for the refund itself of course!). I'd advise patience and wait for the actual cancellation email to come through, then link from there."
"""This is just in case my cancelled flight date is missed before the refund is processed""There is no deadline to claim a refund."
"As for post 583, when clicking on the refund link in the email, it takes you to the login page, not the refund page."
Logged in at 0330 and it worked first time after days of trying.It's purely a system overload try during the night
I also got the e mail and used the link but it still isn't working saying i have an invalid booking reference !
HelloMy flight was cancelled yesterday and like you I fill the online form in and the same Pop up message appears telling me my reservation # is not valid I appreciate it's not Ryanairs fault regarding the virus but they will no doubt be measured on their ability to treat customers correctly and manage this situation well as I believe it will impact on their future.I paid by creditcard but even they are advising me to deal with the airlineNightmare
"Yes, I’m having the same trouble with a cancelled flight form... no telephone numbers working either. Is the reference number the same as the reservation number?"
"Mysel;f and my brother also having the same problem, Called helpline 3 times yesterday, call hung up on each attempt after taking me through the various options.This morning have been waiting a response on the chat option on their site for over an hour now. >>Yet another conspiracy theory<< Conspiracy or complete incompetence - you choose."
I've had this email and the link is still unsuccessful - giving me the same error regarding invalid reservation number.
Can anybody paste here working refund link (received by email)? May be we can create our own link with required personal data.
I too received an email confirmation and it took me to a special page which had the reservation number pre-populated.You need to wait for the email it seems
I have the same problem. Did someone find a solution?? to many massages here...
Hi Yes just experience the same problem Cant get any joy
"Has anyone actually managed to get a refund yet? Phone number is not available at this time, call back option also doesn't work."
It is because of too many people trying st same time.Try in the middle of the night it goes through straight away
Yes I have been trying all week too do they wait until the date the flight should have been perhaps and they are doing them in date order??
very frustrated invalid res number again and again what do i do
"Hey, guys, i was in the same situation, but I received a new e-mail from ryanair this morning. There was a link with an another refund application form with automaticaly filled reservation number, so you need just to wait, and check your e-mail.Good luck to everyone, I know what you're feeling right now, bros!"
Anyone tried or considered a section 75 credit card claim for money back? Bank and airline dual liability in these cases.Am worried that the backlog of failed refund attempts is just snowballing and the chances diminish. Should be an automated process possible so struggling vendors can rely on technology to give back money just as it did when taking the automated c card payment.
I was Also trying the last few days but I got an email through Ryanair today with a different link and that went through straight away
"I am having exactly the same problem, it says invalid registration number but everything is rightEdited: 8:01 am, March 20, 2020 "
"Yes, someone just said a few posts ago that trying in the early hours worked. Just a system overload .. which will now move to silly o clock!"
Im having the same problem- how dare they hold on to our money. Furious. Did anyone get a refund or even have success applying?
"Hello, same problem here. I´ve tried to get the refund today 20/03/20 but I get the same Ryanair system answer: ""the the flight reservation number is incorrect"" This is ilegal. Could anyone get the refund in the end? Please take a screen shot´s message as a proof of the issue. All my best wishes for everyone."
Just as an update - both legs of my trip are now cancelledI got a text this morning saying check email - the email arrived about 12 hours later - that email has the new link where all flight details are prefilled in Flights booked for 26/3 & 31/3Might be worth just waiting
"I’ve had the same problem as everyone else in that the system doesn’t seem to recognise my booking reference, even though I know I’ve entered it correctly (and repeatedly).People need to take a deep breath & calm down, however. Ryanair’s IT systems will inevitably be under extreme pressure just now & it’s not surprising that they’re not performing as they should. I’m finding the same thing with several other non-travel companies I’ve been trying to contact. A little bit of patience will do everyone some good right now."
Yep - thats exactly whats happening to me just now - and I know the reference is definitely correct - is this yet another O'Leary stalling game? Their practices really are as close to illegal as you can get - be great to have some help - their chat line wont respond to me and Ive been on 45 mins now
"Hi, please I have the same problem. How did you guys solved it?Any advice?Thanks!"
Yes having same message. Ive PM them from facebook
"Hello again 2 all who in the same position!I have 2 reservations, both were cancelled by Ryanair, but the 1st message was with the link to the general refund form, and thr 2nd was with the specific once-generated form with the reservation number that can't be changed! So, the 1st link is pretending to be 'invalid', and the 2nd have just worked at the first go-off!So, they are cheating, definitely."
"Having the exact same problem. I am using the correct reservation number, which is accepted by the system to take me through to the booking, but is not accepted on the refund request form."
"Wait for a text then email link. The email link is already populated with your reservation number and details. The email is the key to the refund, just be patient I guess."
"Just keep retrying guys, I did it like 10-15 times without stopping and they accepted my reservation number."
Keep trying as I tried like 15 times and then they accepted my res number
"I've just received an email from Ryanair that my flight was cancelled, and there was a specific link in it that worked, Previously tried the general refund form and had the same error as everyone. So best to wait for the email and try the link there. Good luck!"

Same happening to me. Other airline's refund confirmed immediately but Ryanair is so painful. Has anyone had any joy??
Same problem for me too. anyone had any joy with a refund or contacting them? Defo not wanting to refund us are they the swines!1
"Thank uhuuu, it worked!"
"I was having the same trouble, tried numerous times, then sent a complaint suggesting they let customers know why this keeps happening. I had a reply acknowledging my complaint immediately, then a couple of minutes later, another email with exactly the same wording as my original cancellation notice, but with a different link. I clicked on it and got another cancellation form with my booking number already on it. Same one I used all along! Problem solved in seconds, refund on the way! This was literally 10 minutes ago. I don't know if the timing was just coincidental, but they are definitely giving refunds."
Yes i get the same error. I think its their way of delaying the process cause they are dealing with a lot of refunds right now. I tried calling and live chat but couldnt get through to a human. The chat bot is completely useless. Im just going to wait for a few days and try again.
Hi. I too had the same problem. Thought it was me then blamed my computer. I spent over two hours trying to find out what I was doing wrong then a news flash on my phone this morning said it was a fault at the Ryanair site. I am just about to try again . good luck
"I was having the same refund issues as everyone else but have just received an email from Ryanair actually confirming my flights are cancelled. It included a link to the refund form which is actually a slightly different version to the one I had been trying via the website, my reservation number was pre filled in and it worked fine (I hope!)"
"Hi guys, check your email when you can. Ryanair has now sent a link redirecting us to another online form that seems to be working."
Same here
Can you guys upload the link with the new form???
Yes. I have exactly the same problem. And cannot get through to them. Appalling service from Ryanair
UPDATEI eventually got through - now to wait and see if i actually get the refund £££££££££££ good luck all
I have lodged a refund d claim through a website called resolver.I think it has something to do with moneysavingexpert. It's the only thing I could think of to try as it is impossible to get through to Ryanair.
Yes I have exactly that problem!!
"The same issue here, I filled the complain, I sent them email and message on facebook but so far no reply."
"I’m getting the same message, has anyone found a solution?"
where did you complain to?
I am not a robot and am intelligent enough to enter the correct code; but like everyone above I am getting the same message.
Thanks I am trying to remain patient and don’t want to add to the stress we are all under: so I avoided going back to try again until I just got a text reminder of the cancellation! OMG
"Use the online form as stated above appears to be working, but won't know perhaps for 10 days. but had conformation email of receiving request."
I managed to do it! I just had to submit it lots of times and then one of the times got lucky! - just waiting for the refund now!
"Hi there,I am trying to refund 4 flights since 4 days. (all cancelled flights)All the time I got same answer as in the topic title (reservation number invalid).SOLUTION FOR ME:Keep repeating and repeating with request and once it will work.I have repeated ca. 40 times with request.I got the message:Thank you for your refund application.Once approved your refund request will be processed within 7 working days to the original form of payment and should show in your account within the next 5-7 working days. A confirmation email will be sent to the address provided in your booking.Regards, Srdan"
"That's so unprofessional! I mean, I knew I shouldn't trust Ryanair but that's on another level.... Has anyone tried to just change their flights? How has that work for you, if so?"
6 attempts to get the right result. Had no email to say the flight was cancelled. They really are the worst of the worst.
"Yesterday it was ""invalid reservation number."" Now it is ·invalid captcha.""I have always been happy with Ryanair´s service but, on this occasion, they are obviously acting dishonestly."
"This was the same for me. Refund form on website said reservation number is invalid. But they just sent me an official cancellation email with a link to click, and this took me to a form that has worked. I guess check your spam if you think you should have an email."
"Try at 3am when their website has low traffic ... their IT is overwhelmed.https://downdetector.co.uk/status/ryanair/Edited: 11:29 am, March 20, 2020 "
I took the email route - and got the same response.
Tried for 2 days and today (day before flying) new e-mail with reference number on arrived from Ryanair and it went through first time
Once they sent me an email it all worked
"Do not use the website form to claim for a refund, wait for the cancellation notification email from Ryanair and use the link on this to claim. Worked for me first time."
"Hello,Finally, trying and trying again, I made it. My request has been recorded. I am still waiting for approval.I used the form dedicated for refund, not the link given by the e-mail.Edited: 12:00 pm, March 20, 2020 "
Hey I finally managed to get a refund after days trying. It only worked when I logged in to my account and not when I applied only with flight number and email address. Good luck #ryanairrefund @ryanair
Just done mine through the email that they sent me with the booking ref already in place. I think doing it from your account with Ryanair doesn’t work.. wait for the email from them with a link. It says it will take up to 7 days. Happy with that if it works x
Following advice on another reply I have finally got a refund by changing the language of the refund form to Norwegian!!! I live in France & had previously tried unsuccessfully many times in both French & English. Norwegian worked first time.
After trying to get the system to work for 2 days finally i have been able to complete the refund process. I have received a message to say that if my request is approved i will receive a refund in 5-7 days.
"If you still need to submit for refund, I just did it, and finally worked for me."
"I've got my refund. Persevere with the refund form, retyping the captcha. It took 3 days but eventually went through."
Just managed to get through as well (took 2 tries though).
"yes, indeed, I have the same problem, it says my reservation number is invalid, the system has obviously gone down, and in due course if the company survives it must honour it's clients right for refund, otherwise will claim through MasterCard"
Hello! I had the same problems and i tried for 2 Days. This night i got an email from Ryanair with the information that my flight was cancelled and with a link for the refund which worked. So check you email also the spam! The cancellation of my flights was visible on the ryanair website but i had to wait for the email which arrived 2 days later.
"Same situation here!I got 4 flights cancelled from Ireland to Spain.Refund button is not working, When I managed to get to the refund application form, I am not able to submit because ""incorrect reservation number"". For the 4 cases!I started believing in online conspiracy theories about Ryanair making it imposible for customers to get the money back. More credible than pure incompetence!"
"The refund website does now appear to be working as I was able to submit mine and got confirmation that I'd get a refund in 7 working days once it had been approved, I kept a pdf copy of that as proof! I was also able to finally get hold of someone on the RA online chat earlier this afternoon after a 5 hour wait using this link:https:/… Don't believe the count down timer on the online chat and don't let your computer go to sleep while waiting as I think that boots you off the system (happened to me twice in the last 24 hours). Also keep a copy of the transcript as evidence.Good luck all!"
Just managed to get through too using the reservation number to log in rather than the cancellation email or email log in (those didn't work for me). Again like other posts this took a couple of days.
Now i am getting a message that my flight was NOT cancelled :/
"Ryanair send a text then an email with unique link. I clicked the link and my reservation number was already added to the refund form. Refund will be loaded to credit card in 3 to 5 days. My travel date was 6th April Edinburgh to Tenerife. The text and email will arrive, be patient."
"Just managed to process my refund through Ryanair after 7 goes, keep trying, I went through the website"
"I had the exact same thing but now managed to submit a refund. I received the notification that my flight was canceled yesterday. I tried last night. Did not work. Today after 24hours I tried again. No error message and managed to submit the refund. I feel Ryanair could have synced reservation numbers with cancelation information better, but it must be very busy these days."
"Try your home country‘s language if you haven’t done it already. That worked for me. I booked the flight in Germany and when I tried to get the refund I didn’t bother about the language which was preset to English on the website. However, the system would tell me that all sorts of entries were incorrect, such as the reservation number, name etc.. When I switched to German, the system worked as expected. Maybe an ASCII issue? Anyhow, try it out. Good luck!"
"Finally got the refund notification for my first flight at 5.45 this morning, I had tried from 1.30 to 2.00 in the night without success. Then for the second flight got through this afternoon quite quickly. Think this is just luck of the draw and so many trying as more flights get cancelled. if you think Ryanair are bad, the trip was to Krakow with accomodation booked through Laterooms. Impossible to contact them so contacted hotel direct, they say they don't receive payment till date of visit so this means Laterooms have my money with no way to contact them to get it back!"
Hi We had the same trouble but after a while found that what we thought was the number 1 in our reservation number was actually the letter I . Think they are just trying to make it as difficult as possible for people.
Mine is to hun wonder why have u managed to get sorted out x
"I've just been advised my inbound flight is now cancelled, in addition to the outbound (see post no. 39).Followed the link provided in the email, ticked the box for 'refund everything for everyone' and got the refund request confirmation back immediately - 7 working days processing promised.I might regret saying this before the money arrives, but respect to Ryanair for keeping their systems and processes (and policies) just about going in the middle of what must be complete chaos."
You must be the first to which everythinh went correctly so fast.
I have the same problem.... I know it’s correct!!
"As I assume many of you are finding, this refund process is now working. At least it's not reporting the error of the original poster. Whether I get any of my money back, will be yet another long time to find out!"
"This does not work for me!! They’ve just changed the error message to say they have too many people applying for a refund!!! Liars!!! Compete scum!!We are currently experiencing a high volume of refund requests, unfortunately we cannot process your application at the moment. Please try again later. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause."
"I have this same problem and tried 4 different numbers I got off the internet for customer services/ refunds today, all numbers said the number didn’t exist!"
""" They’ve just changed the error message to say they have too many people applying for a refund!!!""In other words, they've changed the error message to accurately reflect what's happening."
I have tried 100 times and when it was 101 it had WORKED!so keep trying!
No Lexexpress they are not accurately reflecting what’s happening!! They are purposely doing this to avoid refunds!
"I had an email from Ryanair two days ago stating my flight on the 22nd March was cancelled. Like all of the other posters on here, I kept getting the message that my reservation number was invalid. However, I have just received another email this evening from Ryanair with a different link to a slightly different form. On completion of this form I immediately received a message saying my refund request had been received and payment would be made within 20 days. Hope this helps."
Rich9000 do you have the new link you could share? Thanks
U get to Ryanair or no
Is u got managed to get refund or no I m trying from 2 days nothing happened
Wait for the email from Ryanair with the link. Click on that. You get a simple form and hey presto.
"Hussainfs the link was specific for my flight to a form pre filled with my flight details. I think due to the high numbers it's just a case of them sending the link in turn, so depending when your flight is, will in turn place you in line for the amended refund email. I see that others on here have also received the revised link."
Check your emails. Ryanair are sending new cancellation notices with a different link. Your reservation number will already be in the link and you will get your refund.

Now that my travel date has now passed the website is not showing my return flight as cancelled so no facility to keep trying to get a refund.
Please share a link of that form you have downloaded. I cannot find it. Thanks! Also did you send it then by e-mail? Please share this address too. Many thanks!
If you're talking about the email link Ryanair is sending out it is passenger specific so you cannot use it. Try to the generic refund form (which seemed to be working better yesterday) or wait for them to send you the email.
"I also got a personal email with my reservation details filled in. Unfortunately, I always get an 'error' message. Unbelievable...."
Hi same problem here tried for 5 days. Funnily enough it recognises flight should I wish to change the flight which I do not. Then afternoon if the cancelled flight I received email to see flight now running to to airport 2 hrs after sue departure!Did you find any solution.
"I have just tried to go through the process to claim my refunds and now have the following message:Unfortunately we cannot process your application for one of the following reasons: We are currently experiencing a high volume of refund requests, unfortunately we cannot process your application at the moment. Please try again later. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.Fingers crossed this different message is progress and when the volumes die down that claiming a refund will be possible."
"Just be patient!No airline in the world is pre-equipped to deal with the cancellation of 80% of its flights. Of course there will be delays - I just checked my own refund application once or twice a day, secure in the opinion that eventually it would come through: which it did after 5 days.Be grateful that you booked with an airline (with which I have no association) that is financially safe with a large cash balance and will not be one of the many that are likely to go bust in the present crisis!"
The link from the email you hopefully get about cancelled flight did work for me yesterday. Refund going through the system now. 7 working days.I may get a nice surprise of shorter time.All other attempts via my booking or flight updates to my destination came up with the error messages many are seeing.
Thanks Rich9000 - I shall await the link appreciate your response.
I tryed this morning couple of times and it worked for me
"Hi, No l booked directly with Ryanair."
I have been trying since the 16th when they cancelled my flight from Seville to Lisbon. At first it was wrong reservations number now the message is can't cancel until 3 hours after flight. Very sad that this airline is risking it's good name. I won't fly with them again.
It has worked for me right now.Flight from Valencia to Ibiza 18th March.
it worked!
"To those who have managed to get a refund, congratulations! Please tell how you did it.. i.e via app, logging in to Ryanair website, via Contact Us/Refund Form page, email link etc. as I have been trying all these routes since I received my cancellation email on 17/03 but to no avail. I doubt that I will receive another cancellation email with the working link populated with my details. I also tried submitting the form at different times of the day, late at night and early hours in the morning (1:45 and 3am) still nothing. Though I didn’t actually count but I’m sure I tried at least 20 times each go. I’m starting to lose hope."
I managed to talk on Live Chat with Ryanair today they told me they passed the refubd for me and within 28 days I will get email confirminh my refund due to high volume of requests.
"I managed! Like most people in the thread I've tried to get the refund to work, and after a mere 50.000 tries, today 21 March at 17:55 it worked. The name of the passenger seems to be case sensitive. The invalid code message did not appear this time. I got the receipt with a promise to get a refund, but it remains to see if the money actually shows up. Good luck everyone!"
"Hi All,The latest message that i have just gotten when trying to complete claim is the following:""Unfortunately we cannot process your application for one of the following reasons:A previous application has already been submitted for this booking.""But i have received no notification of refund being processed?Hopefully it is being processed???Edited: 1:34 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Hi.My refund application has finally gone through after trying for three days.Message reads "" Once approved your refund request will be processed within 20 working days to the original form of payment and should show in your account within the next 5-7 working days. a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the address provided in your booking.""And now we wait."
"It works today after a couple of tries.Good if Ryanair will refund it all to all.And if so - if Ryan survives in this adverse cash-pressing period, Ryanair will strengthen its reputation."
Yes I got the same problem. I’m going to be calling them first thing Monday 23rd March. Have you managed to sort problem out.
I'm getting same problem now it's saying my details don't match with reservation number??? Anyone had this problem? Very annoying
"I received an email from ryanair to cancel my flight due to coronavirus.I was told that I can make a new reservation without it costing me a fee.I have tried to make a new reservation through their website, but the price is twice as expensive if I book the same reservation with the 3rd partner, for example. via http://momondo.com/ (for the same trip at ryanair).Isn't that cheating?And I can't get an answer from their ""refound claim"" either, and I get the same answer as all the others."
"The prices shown on 3rd party sites is unlikely to be live. There's no reason not to ask for a refund. Keep trying the refund page, lots of people have managed to get through in the last day or two but you may need to try several times."
"Hi all,After days of trying, I finally managed to go through with my claim via this link: https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/Now they have 20 days to process.Good luck :)!"
I'm having the same problem with Lufthansa. My flight info is on my homage but when I click on details it says booking can't be found. Last week the booking was on the site. No email from them saying the flight was canceled.I booked thru Capital One Credit Card Rewards. The same thing is happening there. When I hit My Trip details the page is blank. Yesterday the details page was there.
I got through. Flight EDI - BGZ cancelled on 02.04.Also had the issue with reservation no. I have booking both wwys but Just one way is cancelled. I proceded with just one way flight and it worked.
"Am I correct in thinking that there is One reservation number for both outbound and inbound flights? So, will there be two separate refund processes, one for each flight?Thanks."
I have successfully submitted my refund application. Has anyone yet received an email confirming the approval of their refund application ?
Still no luck... silly burgers have forwarded rules re our baggage AFTER the cancelled and forwarded us forms to get refund... any joy for people in situation same as me?
Any joy getting sorted??
"Still no Joy, different error message each time, although it does sometimes say that volumes of refund requests are high, please try later. Been trying for days now."
"Hi All,I eventually (After 40 minutes ) made contact with Ryanair customer services. The agent confirmed that my refund had gone through (was being processed) and I should receive it within the next 20 days. I asked him to please confirm by email? And he said that I would get an email in about 28hrs.Sounds good but I have my fingers crossed."
Just out of curiosity I entered the chat again and they again processed my refund without seeing that I already had made a previous contact. I honestly dont know what is going on.
"I must have tried over 100 times in their stupid form. Today, I tried the chat again, and after about 15 minutes I got a person who told me that the refund will be processed in the next 7-10 days."
"yes i am having the same issue, but there my reservation number is not 6 digits. i checked everywhere and i cant find any 6 digits reservation number"
"Hi, did you have any luck with the e-mail? I am struggling to get a refund, too."

I submitted mine a week ago today and received no email. I took a photo of the screen when it finally got successfully submitted.
prick stop posting if you have nothing intelligent to state
within 20 days nice of them to be so quick
On going around in circles with the refund page. It keeps putting up different error messages and when you correct one 'error' it tells you that you have made a different one. Eventually it just shows a message that they can't refund you now. In my opinion this is like a loop that has deliberately put in place to avoid paying customers what they are legally entitled to get.
What are you talking about 'conpiracy theory.' Were all being done out of money by an extremely profitable airline on a home of extreme need for us. Say hello to Michael O Leary for me and tell him we want our money back!!!
I had this message on 1 flight and on another flight saying it wasn't cancelled yet which it was. I just kept trying at different times and eventually it worked. I didn't get any email confirmation but took a screenshot
"From submitting my Ryanair refund claim to receiving the money in my bank account was over 3 weeks, so don't hold your breath."
"Hi,I've had the same issue and kept trying for days getting the error message. I thought I'd give their live chat a try - this was just now at around 8.15pm UK time. The chat bot started the chat - my first post was 'I want to chat to a human'. Despite it sounding quite rude, I was connected to a human agent called Victoria straight away who checked my reservation and said that I had already submitted a refund claim and it was being processed. I've taken a screenshot of the chat and will use it as proof if necessary. Hope this helps someone.Edited: 4:33 pm, March 25, 2020 "
"I'm having the same issues. I tried to contact them on Facebook and Instagram but no response so far. I also sent an email to contact@laudamotion.com but again, nothing happeneded..."
I had this issue also .filled out the online refund form then noticed it said my reservation number was invalid .But i also recieved an email from ryanair pointing out that all april flight change fees were cancelled. At the beginning of this email it showed a reservation number different to the one on my original booking .By chance i tried this new reservation number and it worked .I should be getting my refund in 20 - 28 days .Lets wait and see .
"Been trying for 2 days to apply for a refund, I've been going through 'manage my bookings' to submit the request but continually getting the message 'due to the high volume' etc etc.Tried at 05.45 today using the link on the email from Ryanair and the request was accepted, supposedly getting my refund within 5-7 working days.S1."
i have the same problem .your flight reservation number is invalid. Please check the flght reservation number you have entered. Then i tried again: flight is not cancelled or delay in 3 days. Or we can not answer you at this moment ...... serveral days i m trying. for a booking from 16 March till 20 March.
"Hi all,I Just received this message from Ryanair. (Twitter Account)Ryanair sent you a Direct Message.Hi there, we’re processing all claims now - once you have got to the landing page of the form that is confirmation of receipt. We apologise for the longer than normal wait. Thanks for your patience.Does anybody know what it means?Thank youEdited: 1:11 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"What it says. If you get a confirmation message from the refund page, that's your receipt."
I got it through and said they processed it and it would be 5-7 days and that was 14 ago and nothing
"Thanks for the explanation, its some form of confirmation i Hope!!!!!!!"
I think I have got a solution. It has worked form me at least.I was going to fly from UK to Poland. After many unsuccessful tries I changed Airline Code to Ryanair (FR) and Affected Flight Number to just 4 digit number. It went through first time with those changes. Good Luck.
I have just managed to get the Refund Application Form to work after a week of keep on trying without success! I did it with the Airline Code Ryanair (FR) rather than Ryanair UK and for the affected flight entered just the 4 digit number like the person who posted above me. Give it a try and it should work! I got a confirmation from RyanAir to say the refund application would be processed within 20 working days and payment would follow up to 7 working days later. Good Luck!
"EasyJet pulled the same stunt on me, and they are no longer actively refunding anyone. It’s all tactics to avoid the inevitable, which I’d say will be all the budget airlines going under."
Ryanair will be one of the last to go under. They've already said they can survive 12 months without flying.
Not to mention they are a provably profitable operation. Same with easyJet. Unless this drags out for years I would expect both airlines to be able to ride this out.
Did anyone get a confirmation e-mail from Ryanair which they said they will send aft after submitting your application?
I just received an email from them. Basically just saying refunds will take a while to process due to a backpog and not to resubmit my request.
Couldn’t get it to work then got the emails ( I have three separarte bookings) directing me to another form. Tried this and got an error saying I had already Submitted a claim ..... now just a general error message. I’m assuming that one of my many previous efforts actually worked and a refund will be coming ... the question is how long should this take?
"There was no timeline mentioned in the email I got. I'm expecting it take several weeks if not a couple of months. Not only do they have a massive number of bookings to go through, you have think customer services are not working at full capacity due to social distancing and employees being quarantined."
"Our (2 people) Ryanair £251 refund took nearly 4 weeks. They refunded everything:- return flights, priority boarding, bags and row 4 seats."
Just got the same email as Lexexpress.
Im supposed to travel may to spain does that mean we are cancelled to fly then
"May flights are generally still on but they will almost certainly be cancelled. When they are, you will receive an email from Ryanair with info about how to claim a refund."
"If you have paid by paypal and you try to start a dispute, it will tell you to please don't and email paypalquery@ryanair.com. Then Ryanair will send you a link to claim the refund on a page you don't see on the website. I created the dispute after about a day of doing this and yesterday Paypal refunded me.Edited: 6:37 am, March 30, 2020 "
"remember you cant get a refund unless ryanair have sent you a e.mail, to say your flight is cancelled ? im due to go to Malta 13th May, and was told to wait til 24/48 hrs before the 13th to get my refund then 10 days to receive the money , so will have to wait and see, even though all there flights are canceled now till June , i can get my money and would be handy now ,its hard times i can tell you,Edited: 9:01 am, March 30, 2020 "
"yes im going to Malta may 13th but they told me , i will get e.mail 24/48 hrs before the 13th to submit a claim for refund, so you will be the same, then another 10 days for our refunds now, just Ryanair at there best hang onto our money,when i can use the money now, for food or shopping, no job no moneyEdited: 9:09 am, March 30, 2020 "
"only if you received a e.mail to say its can celled, and also did you tick the boxes they asked you to, for example return flight your asking for and all persons refund. you no what there like Ryanair"
Of course is tactic to avoid paying money. Lets see 15% people will give up thinking is no worth of hassle for 50£. How much Ryanair will save?
Yes for me worked copy paste. You need to copy and paste everything step by step reservation nr flight nr name surname do not write nothing there seems to go throu.
Yes same here sis you get it sorted in the end
"Got a response from using the compensation link (https:/…index.php):""As this cancellation was unexpected we wish to advise you that no compensation is due under EU261/2004 as this was caused due to extraordinary circumstances beyond Ryanair’s control.Please be advised that our original notification sent in respect of this cancellation offered you the appropriate EU 261/2004 entitlements, which included either a Full refund of all monies paid or Re-Book free of charge onto alternative Ryanair flights operating from nearby departure or arrival airports.""Not sure if thats talking about only compensation or talking about not getting a full refund..."
"Sounds pretty clear to me - they are saying that they have already offered you a full refund (all your money back) or a rebook, but that you are not entitled to compensation over and above that."
Thanks for the solution! :)
"The crafty sods have deliberately linked the button to the wrong claim form, presumably to discourage claims. Go to https://https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/ and you'll get the right form. Then it's just a few easy entries to claim the refund....although even then they'll tell you it will take over a month to process!Never using Ryanair again!"
Just tried the above 12 times. Did'nt work for me.
"""The crafty sods have deliberately linked the button to the wrong claim form, presumably to discourage claims. Go to https://https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/ and you'll get the right form.""Eh, that's the form everybody has been using since the beginning of the thread."
Indeed it is lexexpress. Problem for me is the following. 26/3/20...Submitted request for refund.28/3.20....Email from Ryanair saying they have my request and not to re-submit another request.30/3/20....Received another email asking me to apply for a refund.Confused.
A lot of people have received the second email (including myself). I doubt it's necessary to request a refund again (I haven't).
Ok. Thank you.
"think its time to contact the OFT, as Ryanair get away with anything they want, its a disgrace the way they treat the public, just not right at all, all worked out, to do any thing but refund people there money, they should be ashamed, its awfull treating us like this, not nice and very up setting it is.,when some of us need our refund, who have lost jobs, or on short time."
The OFT have no juristiction in Southern Ireland.
"thanks will contact my lawyer i think or some of the big news papers, its about time they were exposed for the way the treat there customers not good, will contact some tomorrow, see what the reporter says. thanks ."
"#805. Don’t you read the news it’s been reported many times in the National papers, so don’t waste your breathe."
"I’m having the same problem. Different answers. Either no such reservation number, wrong name or flight not cancelled."
"hello, just Ryanair at there best , trying to delay, im due to fly 13/05, i no the flight will be cancelled, and asked for my money, as lost job,no income was told no, not tll your flight is cancelled, and it will be 24/48 hrs before take off, i should get e.mail to tell me my flight is not on, !!you just have to keep trying if you got e.mail to say your flight is can celled, there are various forms on line for to claim your money back from Rayanir, so have a look for them try them, think at the mo there are 2."
"Re my reply at number 797...sorry, I've somehow duplicated the ""https://"" part by mistake. If you eliminate that duplication, the address will take you to the correct claim form."
"Again, this is the refund form everybody has been using since the beginning of the thread."
"Hey I had the same problem Ryanair should have texted you saying your flight is cancelled your original reservation number is on there If not call up kiwi and ask for the Ryanair reservation number. I’ve just had to do the same thingEdited: 3:35 pm, April 03, 2020 "
Cut and paste the reservation number from email.. worked for me.

Cooking program? How is it relevant to Ryanair refund.
You have to wait for Ryanair to send you message and email (assuming you booked direct) then you will be given a link to get a refund or change your flights. Ryanair like all of us are a) hoping virus is eliminated by thenAnd b) hanging in to your cash to keep themselves from going underC) refunding on a daily basis by flight order...Make sense
What cooking program?
Post 815 now deleted..self promo about youtube cooking program
I am waiting for three weeks to get my money back. They did say it would take 7 working days. Someone got the money back already?
"I got an email saying that the application filled in using https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/ (the only one working before the flight date, other one was giving ""reservation number invalid""error for days) is not valid for covid refunds.I tried now (after the flight date that never happened) link of https://refundclaims.ryanair.com/ and this time the form gave no error and said that request is being processed. Fingers crossed, hope this helps someone.Edited: 9:47 am, April 04, 2020 "
Cut and paste the reservation number from your email. Worked for me
You can only get refund if you have been sent an email which sends you the link. These are sent out about few days after you receive email saying flight has been cancelled. You can’t claim for flights too far ahead of time... Obviously flight companies have no idea when the ban will be lifted. I have claimed for March and early April so far. I found that cut and paste works best for the reservation number. But recent emails have improved and the reservation number is already included.
"For me, there was an invitation link sent out and still I was getting the error ""reservation number invalid"". And the reservation number was copy pasted correctly, supported by the other form accepting it and now also accepted in the other link. Suppose it was a wrong error message caused by an overload / bug in the system."
"""You can only get refund if you have been sent an email which sends you the link.""That's incorrect. I got through on the generic refund form before I'd received an email about the cancellation."
"Does anyone who applied successfully for refund and received the confirmation received any actual refund back to their account? It's been 3 weeks since I submitted the refund form, support told it will take 20 days to approve it, then I saw that it takes 28 days. Seems that they just don't want to make any refunds at all."
"The fact nobody has been back to say they've received a refund suggests they are being processed very slowly, if at all."
"Dear Customer,I refer to your recent request for a refund on your booking confirmation XXXXXX.Due to the high volume of flight cancellations due to COVID 19, we are experiencing an unprecedented high volume of requests. We are currently working through the backlog and ask that you please bear with us.Please do not resubmit your request.Thank you for your patience and understanding.Yours sincerely,Ryanair Customer ServicesThis may relieve some anxiety on here, will post when refund enters my CC account."
"How long before your flight do you get the email for flight cancellation. I am due to fly 2nd May.Edited: 7:11 am, April 06, 2020 "

Its work for me
Directly with Ryanair
hello I am facing the same thing it's even tells me that my name it's not valid but that's the name on the ticket
"Did you get an email about the cncellation and if so, have you tried following the link to a refund in that?"
When do we expect our refund as im due to fly 14th may
This problem has been going on for weeks. What are Ryanair doing - probably nothing. I expect out money's getting a nice bit of interest for them.
"""When do we expect our refund as im due to fly 14th may""Has your flight been cancelled? Have you requested a refund?"
I received a cancelation notice for my April 25th flight today. I filed for a refund and it seems I need to expect up to five weeks for the money to show up in my account. If you're flying May 14th when you receive your cancelation it'll likely be five weeks after you file your request.
"I have a Ryanair flight on 11th May to Portugal returning 18th, These dates are still for sale on their website. When can I expect a cancelled flight email."
They are working in departure date order Malagabob so you're a long way behind me in the queue!
I filed for a refund and it seems I need to expect up to five weeks for the money to show up in my account. as I understood they first approve refund request an only after that you need to wait for refund. They are working in departure date - seems that they are not working at all. My cancelation was probably among the first in March even before the shutdown due to covid. It's been almost a month and no signs or refund from them. Horrible.
"A,M. But don’t they have to cancel the flight first. If it goes ahead. I don’t turn up. I can’t claim. Unless on insurance. As FCO advice against travel."
Your flight is far into the future. They'll cancel it in a week or two and send you a notice.
When am i getting a cancellation for my flights as i have heard nothing and was due to fly in May
#850 Yes Bob. I have a AGP-LPL flight booked for 6th May that hasn't been cancelled yet
"""When am i getting a cancellation for my flights as i have heard nothing and was due to fly in May""I'll ask again, has your flight been cancelled? You won't be able to claim a refund until it is."
"So I just contacted ryanair support and seems that we are not gonna get any refund. They told they have no idea when refund will be proceeded and they can't help with that, just ask to wait forever until their team will sort out all inquiries. This means like 10 year probably. I am considering to claim money back via Mastercard. It will take ages too, but who knows. I 'd be happy to change dates of my flight or at least receive voucher like in AirFrance or WizzAir but Ryanair didn't provide this option either."
"Can you help. I’ve received a an email for my flight on 3rd May saying I can change my flight up to 31st August. I wish to cancel my flights as I doute I will be traveling anywhere this year. Should I expect an email saying the flight is cancelled before I am able to try and get a refund? Thanks.Edited: 9:47 am, April 08, 2020 "
Yes. You need to wait likely a week longer for the cancelation email
Should I expect an email saying the flight is cancelled before I am able to try and get a refund? Thanks. - yes wait till they will cancel it and send you the email. Thus you can fill the refund form. Or change the dates but I am not sure that they will operate this summer normally.
Thanks
"Hi Jayne,I received the same email today for a flight on the 1st May, I've no intention of moving the flight as we were meeting friends so I'll wait for the next step in the process which will be the cancellation email i guess."

"It is not right, the reservation number is still valid and in muy case I had to wait a minute doing nothing and suddenly they accepted it"
"You might be right... it is always a headache, the same with many other companies of low cost, except NORWEGIAN"
"We all know that they are inundated with refund claims, but why can't they be honest with us? All Ryanair need to do is give us timescales & confirm that they will give us our money back."
They have. Last email I had was that the refund will arrive about five weeks after you file your claim.
"""This problem has been going on for weeks. What are Ryanair doing - probably nothing. I expect out money's getting a nice bit of interest for them.""I'm sorry but this shows very little understanding of how modern businesses work. You seem to have an image like the dragon from the Hobbit sitting on piles of gold, defending it with their lives.Fact is, airlines like this run on some pretty tight margins - they still have employees to pay, maintenance to do on aircraft, contractual fees with airports, etc. Those do not go away when all business stops. Low cost airlines tend to have even tighter margins. They have had to lay off (or furlough) staff. Call centers cannot function because of either social distancing mandates or the communities where they are located being told to shut down everything but essential businesses.Look, I'm not trying to defend the airlines, but the idea that they are all fat-cats and profiting from this is a biased outlook that is really, really far from the truth. lot of people are being put out right now - some with their health, and many with their money. There is no ""win-win"" to be had right now, there isn't really a ""win-lose"" - all most people have is a ""lose-lose"". We need to be prepared for that, and not expect things to be business as usual for a long while yet."
"I am experiencing the same problem - incorrect name/invalid booking reference, which is not the case. Appreciate that Ryanair are extremelybusy but I am starting to lose patience, any suggestions very welcome."
"Keep trying, use the link in the cancellation email or contact their customer services."
Well I kept trying on and off for some days and succeeded yesterday.One day the money will hopefully turn up!
I just tried to get a refund. Exact same problem. Scam alert.
What time of the day did it work? Thanks :)
So quick to call something a scam my friend
I just tried again and reservation number still coming up as invalid. Could there be another way of putting in reservation number?
"Have you received an email notifying you of the cancellation? If so, have you tried going through the link provided?"
"""What time of the day did it work? Thanks :)""About 2pm in the afternoon."
BA doing the same to stop giving a refund and hoping I will take the voucher option. Very underhanded....I will hold out for now as they cannot not cancel an inbound flight if they have cancelled the outbound ones. Or can they???
Of course they can but it's a moot point anyway as you can get a refund for both outbond and inbound flight if either is cancelled.
i received an email and they said to me that i cant refund.
Can you? I thought only entitled to voucher not full refund if they have not cancelled both flights...only the one so far. Do cant get put there but they want to bring me back!
"Anton G. What reason did Ryanair give ?Edited: 5:26 pm, April 15, 2020 "
They said that EU commision announced some guidelines for cancellations due to Cov 19. Because of that ryanair have the right to not refund.
You can also read this link from ryanair.https:/…20EN.pdf
"From your link ........ 2.RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT OR RE-ROUTING. If you are denied boarding (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) or your flight is cancelled, you are additionally entitled to choose between: a) reimbursement pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Regulation within seven days, by means provided for in Article 7(3), of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought, for the part or parts of the journey not made and for the part or parts already made if the flight ......"
Yeah but also see the flight cancellation
"As I've had full refunds for return flights in March and April, you clearly don't know what you are talking about."
"My up coming Ryanair flights were cancelled yesterday, the cancellation email contained a link to use if I wanted a refund.I filled out my details and 5 minutes later received an email confirming that my refund was being processed."
"In flight cancellation says that : < please note that Ryanair is entitled to refusecompensation when: you are informed of the cancellation at least two weeks before thescheduled time of departureEdited: 6:04 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Anton,Compensation is different from refunding the cost of your flights."
So refund give you all of your money and comenstation some of that?
"Your now talking about EU261 compensation, not flight refunds. NOBODY gets any compensation for events outside the airline's control. Get your facts right!"
Ok now i understand.Thank you!
You will get back the amount that you paid for your flights but you will not get any compensation on top of that.
Thank you very much. The email says about the EU261 compensation and i didn't know that it does not have to do with refund. My fault : /
"Tried at least 30 times, my application keeps getting bounced for every field on the claim form, e.g flight number, name not recognised, air line ref. etc, etc, frustrating tactic by Ryanair"
David K. The only thing that works is the link embedded in your cancellation email. What date is your flight?
"After 3 weeks, still cannot get link to work, except it no longer gives the option on the flight booking to apply for refund. Tried requesting using a previous link in this forum, now says that they are unable to deal with refund, try later. Impossible to get thru to anyone and they are not doing anything to improve the refund site for customers. They dont want to give refunds easily do they!Edited: 6:29 pm, April 16, 2020 "
You can also use the live chat
"Tried numerous times, no chat forthcoming from ryanair!"
"Checking the Ryanair site, the canceled flight info only goes up to April 27th CWL-FAO. My flight is on the 11th May. Surely they know if they are cancelling this flight. I have to checkin for return 48hrs before departure. But have got boarding passes for return. Am I considered as Checked in.I booked seats after initial booking. Is this why the 48hr applies.How long before the flight, have others received their email informing of a canceled Ryanair flight.Thanks."
I had an AGP-LPL flight booked for 6th May. I received the cancellation email on Tuesday 14th April. I clicked on the link in the email and got an immediate response that my refund is being processed.
"It doesn't matter if you're checked in, your flight will almost certainly be cancelled anyway. When it is, you can request a refund."
"I received my cancellation email on 14th April for my return flights to Girona on 1st and 4th May.As mentioned in post #898 the only thing that seems to work regarding refunds is by using the link in your cancellation email.On opening the link my booking reference number was already entered on it leaving me just to enter my name and agree that the claim was for both flights and all people on that booking.Edited: 4:52 am, April 17, 2020 "
"""Checking the Ryanair site, the canceled flight info only goes up to April 27th CWL-FAO. My flight is on the 11th May. Surely they know if they are cancelling this flight. ""Without knowing Ryanair's specific situation, EasyJet is quite open that they currently cancel flights 7 days before scheduled departure, to avoid swamping their IT systems and call centres. I'm sure they already know that certain flights cannot happen too, it is just that explaining things isn't really part of the Ryanair psyche."
"An uodate.. I searched google for Rtanair livechat, hit link and was connected within 1 minute, explained my issue, agent sent a screenshot of what completed form should look like, i tried again whilst agent was on line. 1 form worked, the other did not, sane reason , flight reference not recognised, tried 4 times whilst agent was connected. Agent then completed from his side and obviously it worked.I have now just received 5 emails from Ryan air telling me my refund is being processed!Thank you all for your imput, hope your issues get sorted."
Just gets better. After receiving emails from Ryanair I requested refunds and after a couple of weeks contacted them and was told my applications were in the system and it would be 28 working days before refund would be paid. That’s ok I thought and sat back. Tonight received an email saying I had a voucher I could use. Seems this is the new tactic. God knows where to go from here.
"I had two flights cancelled by Ryanair in March from Tenerife and stranded there until got a jet2 rescue flight for £1760. Tried to get refund told it would be int he queen this morning got email stating that my class had been closed and because of EU ruling that it is an extraordinary situation no refund would be forthcoming, not even given offer of rebook or vouchers so nothing. They took my rebooking sum of £315 only to cancel within 24 hours. I have always liked Ryanair but right enough never had any emergency but they are the worst thieves ever. Good luck to everyone but it looks like I am financing Ryan to the sum of £709 which was my original flight home ."
"We have/had Ryanair flights booked March to June, 4 destinations. To be fair we use them as they are usually bottom line best value & have a good punctuality record. Also the present situation is not their fault. However they are consistent in making it more difficult to deal with unexpected circumstances than other providers. Right back to the start I had to deal with their unrecognised reference. Then they started sending specific emails with links which allowed you to claim your refunds. Or so we thought, but no after nearly 4 weeks receive an email stating the refund is in the form of a Ryanair voucher. They cannot refund your money at the present time as it is not secure as their employees are working from home. You can claim your money back but your claim will be put in a queue to be dealt with when the crisis is over. Goodness knows when this will be. The positive with the voucher is that it is valid a year & eg you could book next April for say a flight in October 2021. Looking at other sites it would appear that TUI will not make the refund for a year. So it is not just Ryanair. You have to feel sorry for those with no holiday, no refund & not getting paid so could do with the money."
I think I have got the same message as you exactly like you did after requesting a full refund and not a voucher. The link to get the refund takes me to a page with no further info or means to get in touch. The live chat is unresponsive all day. Have you figured out how to either get in contact with customer service or how to proceed with a refund after the latest email

"You will get offered a voucher and have no way of contacting Ryanair and then become a creditor and if it all goes wrong be last on the list to get anything.Other airlines are processing refunds with a bit of a hassle contacting them, but not Ryanair no way.They did say in a statement that they where cash rich and could last a year.That must be with existing customers money that they wont give back.Not heard of anyone getting a cash refund."

I have had the same issue. However i did manage to process this. However the 28 days are now up and i have been online with ryanair agents and this the comments they have made to me.they are not giveing refunds as there agents who process the refunds are not there. (Rubbish)and they are now telling me to accept a voucher.What can i do?
"Take the voucher, ask to be put in a queue for a refund or dispute the charge with your cardprovider."
"Time-line from flight cancellation 15th March.Offered refund through unique email link on 20th March.Now ( 20/04/2020) just been offered voucher with an 18 digit number or use the link for refund. As mentioned above, Ryanair is not telling customers to accept the voucher. There is an option for full refund. The 18 digit voucher number will create chaos, but Ryanair already know this, why they are creating more work for limited staff is absurd. Good luck everyone and be patient."
"My flight should have been 21/03/2020 & was cancelled, I contacted them via the refund link & have waited patiently as I knew they would be busy. Tonight I received a voucher link which I should accept, or go to my booking to request a refund ( which I thought I’d already done ). Followed the links through to my booking to request refund again and surprise surprise my booking is no longer there.... so what am I supposed to do now??? Chat robot is useless"
Both booking reservations I am claiming for are giving invalid reference notices for putting in the information that they gave me. The online system is set up to only accept rebooking & frustrate folks who want refund. Terrible customer service.
yes sent me separate res numbers for me and partner on same flight.told me my partner called them and asked for a flight voucher for himself. he's 72 years old he hasn't a clue how to do anything like that and why would he
Post your Ryanair comments here.https://www.facebook.com/ryanair/

Yep all evidence of the booking erased from my travel history I checked yesterday for cancelled easter flight.
Same thing happened to me. I requested a refund in march they acknowledged request then emailed 2weeks later to tell me to be patient yesterday sent me a voucher and my booking disappeared from my booking history previous 4 flights were there plus one for later this year. We will all still book with them again though when this is over ... so they probably dont care if they loose s few customers but pissing them all off
That's just a request I bet you havent had your money
Same problem here. My reservation code wrong. Crap firm only bkd because flights were cheap. Won’t be using them again by law they have to give refunds.
"I think I found the solution, try changing the 'Airline Code' in the drop down menu. This should match your flight number, I live in the UK so initially chose 'Ryanair UK' (which you think would make sense) but had to change to the 'Ryanair (FR)' code, which seems very odd but matched the flight number found in my itinerary. Hope this helps!"
Yes. I noticed that. Not holding my breath for refund though. Even if the correct details are input. Our flight was booked for 14th May. Have been told that Ryanair will contact us 7-14 days before that date to confirm that it's cancelled & we can claim then.
i had my flight cancelled in mid march i applied for a refund and was sent a voucher that said if i wanted a refund i would have to reapply i have tried numerous times just for the same bull of airline code not valid they are just thieves in my opinion
Can you tell me where can I find the document to request the refund in cash?
"There is no document, you'll need to contact their customer services."
"Pipy,Ryanair sent me an email telling me that my flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago, in that email is a link to claim your refund.Be aware though nobody seems to be getting refunds, they are sending vouchers regardless that we are all asking for a refund."
"Applied for refund.Today received the voucher offer. After waiting on chat for ages, did consider telephoning on 0330 100 78386. But ditched that idea as you've no proof as to what has been agreed.So have contacted via Facebook Messenger. Have answered the questions and provided the information. I have an auto reply saying connecting to an agent......which I doubt. But at least I have timed and dated proof of declining the voucher. And again of requesting my refund"
"Absolutely disgraceful how Ryan Air is treating its customers. No transparency, nye on impossible to contact and lies on top of lies.You can be sure that as soon as countries open up Ryan Air will not cancel their almost full flights even if there is a government warning in place against all but essential travel. That way they will pass the buck to the insurance companies who will have to reimburse your airfare due to the fact that they will almost certainly not cover you for travel to such areas. Ryan Air will care not a jot that any family with an ounce of common sense could not possibly take their flights with no holiday insurance to a place considered high risk by the government.Maybe the government will step in and stop them doing this but with your money already in the bank I would expect the worse while at least hoping for the best outcome from this morally bankrupt airline.A snake in the grass company if ever there was one."
"Obviously is tactic to get as many as possible people to accept this voucher... For me my flight information vanished from my Ryanair account. Cannot click check or anything, There no clear way to apply for money: no for, chatbot is not working with this case so only way is waiting for consultat which will not contact you abviously. So they want you to or accept voucher or not (not getting anything if getting tired of trying). Maybe they should be additionally sued for this practice."
"I'm getting, 'the name does not match the booking reference'. They must have a team having a laugh thinking up new ways to screw the customer. I booked this for my son. Cheapest, but shouldn't have done it as I know them of old. One of their special deals, three nights in Northern Italy, including parking at Liverpool and car rental at Bergamo. Couple of days before they changed it to two nights. No refund for early return of rental car and the early Leaving of Liverpool. Though it's amazing where you can get to around Lake Como and the Alps when you only have a day to explore."
"Maybe we could start a class action-like they do in the USA. Their illegal tactics are being discussed in Parliament, though that won't worry O'Leary."
Keep up the good fight.https:/…
939. I had to capitalise all the letters to get them recognised.against the booking.
"Yes. Continually. I was due to fly out and bring my grandchildren back. They cxl my flight out, offered me a voucher but said I am not eligible for a refund on the return flight as it wasn't cancelled! I argued that I couldn""t get there to get us on the flight back. Will not recognise my reservation numbers at all."
Anyone had success with their refund bank when Debit card used for flights?Thanks.
"""They cxl my flight out, offered me a voucher but said I am not eligible for a refund on the return flight as it wasn't cancelled!""If your outbound and inbound flights were booked separately this is correct."
It's a Ryanair thing. Mr O'Leary don't give a sh...Some customers are accepting refunds and when it comes it's a voucher for a flight that's never going to happen.Their latest trick is that the reference number does not match the name on the reservation. That's the first page of the claim form so you cannot go further. I'll try for a chargeback from the credit card but they won't usually act until you prove you've been in dialogue and the company has refused. As they won't enter into dialogue you're stuffed.
I've had the email for a voucher or a refund.Is the only way to claim a refund is to phone them up ? Thanks
947. You can refuse the voucher via the Ryanair Facebook page.
You can't really. I had it open for 4 hours without reply.
"I kept getting the same message about my name not matching the reservation number. Eventually I realised that there was a space after my first name which I deleted and it worked. So the refund request went through.But from reading this thread, it looks like I'll be sent a voucher? My wife applied for refunds for 3 different trips. It also said they went through. She was sent vouchers. When she goes into Ryanair now and logs on, the trips are gone. There is no way to actually contact them either. I was on chat for 4 hours without reply. They don't answer their phones. Gangsters."
I have six flight refund emails for several immediate family members. Tried to follow the get your refund at the end of the queue route which goes nowhere to even join that queue. All the information seems to be about their normal gift vouchers and there is a 2019 deadline date mentioned in there. My worry now is if I will be able to use more than one voucher for a future family booking without having to break the booking down to say one person at a time. As anyone been able to successfully use these refund vouchers to make a future booking?
"I just got an automated email through about my refund, been trying to get in contact with them for weeks.Found a website that was listing the best ways of getting a refund, https://www.travel-owl.com/r/ryanair, managed to get in contact using the suggested live chat and they sorted out my refund"
Hi thereDid u get this sorted as my friend and I are both having the same problem?
Did anyone pay for the tickets using PayPal and try to get money back through them? Any luck?
"To be fair to Love Holidays they have been very clear and communicated well. Option for a voucher that now includes an additional £25 gift, clear T&C's option still to claim a refund and also offering key workers the chance to claim a refund quicker.They won't get any government support either, BTW.Ryanair, on the other hand, want to intentionally mislead their customers with a link that takes you nowhere and try and drive you into accepting a voucher. This lack of choice is both unfair and illegal. It also allows them to pray on the vulnerable who may not have the know-how or the confidence to tackle them the way some of us are doing, and that's why I despise about an individual like O'Leary. The way they have set up the false link points quite clearly to them trying to exploit customers and there is a difference between that and trying to protect your cash flow by encouraging customers to look at different options."

Im worried what to do as i had my holiday cancelled for may by the accommodation in spain so what do i do nowto get my flights refunded
"As mentioned before I have six cancelled flights. Received an email from Ryanair today inviting me to apply for a refund, only there was no flight reference. I have received 6 emails previously all with the relevant reference on them. However the first 3 just said I would get a voucher but the other 3 I had to click to claim the voucher. All had the claim a refund option that goes nowhere. So there is no consistency in their approach. It is about time some watchdog sorted them out so they are transparent to their customers,"
Posted this on the other Ryanair post as well.Latest update from MSE.https:/…
My flight was als cancelled and I still haven't been able to send the form.
Affected Flight Number RK . What does this mean and where do I find the RK number. It is requested on the refund form.
Your flight number will be in your booking confirmation email and the email notifying you of the cancellation.
"Has there been communication by Ryanair as to when they will provide an update for flights further out (ie July)? It appears travel will be restricted still at that point based on some recent articles on Spain, etc.?"
"They are wise not to provide updates that far out as nobody knows what the situation will be like in 2-3 months. As long as borders are closed, there will be a very limited demand for air travel so much depends on when/if countries start lifting these restrictions."
Any joy?
"Joy of what? Getting through on the online form, getting through to customer services, getting a refund, getting money back from their bank, something else?"
"Yes - same problem today ( 1st May ‘20).It must either be a deliberate tactic to avoid refunding and to ‘look as if ‘ they are obeying their legal obligations with no intention of doing so OR they have a problem with their website.Your email was posted a couple of weeks ago , plenty of time to sort a technical glitch I would have thought . This looks like typical Ryanair behaviour"

There is probably no point in now trying to speak to a human at Ryanair.This is yesterday's Facebook update.https://m.facebook.com/story.php…
"""My post is coming up error occurred,I have entered it dozen of times and. Checked every entry,any suggestions""Did you get an email notifying you of the cancellation? If so, there's a link in there where you can request a refund. I just used it 5 minutes ago and it went through first time."
"They seem to be working in two week blocks, I have been informed this morning that my flight on the 28th May has been cancelled. I can't get the form to submit as it says it is the wrong name on the booking...I have the booking reservation open in another window and all the details are identical. Sounds like a change of 'issue' now :D"
"#973.  I had to capitalise my husband's name to get it accepted.Edited: 4:27 am, May 08, 2020 "
"After requesting a refund from Ryanair, you then get an email with the blurb re the voucher. Do we need to keep that email, it contains around 20 odd numbers and letters? Thanks."
That's the code you need to enter when you book using the voucher.
975. I've kept all my Ryanair emails and backed up with screen shots!
"Thanks folks. So are we supposed to hang on until Ryanair decide to give out refunds? I have'nt laid out a huge amount, it involves 2 trips for 2 people but I have another flight booked in October which I don't hold out much hope for either. Has anyone actually been refunded yet.S1."
"I hope it helps someone, once you get an email check your flight number its there inside the email that you got with the refund offer. your reservation number is in email you got after you purchased the ticket in the first place. so you will need both numbers, or you can get an reservation number once you login to ryanair system. Ryanair sends out emails in few days/week batches, because as soon as government will let airlines operate there will be no refunds, you will have to fly or lose your ticket. thats the ryanair way of doing business I guess."
"""Ryanair sends out emails in few days/week batches, because as soon as government will let airlines operate there will be no refunds, you will have to fly or lose your ticket.""Flights are grounded because there's no demand for air travel, not because the Government says they can't operate. Ryanair have said that the fleet will remain grounded until July and tickets are no longer for sale for June."
"When I received an initial cancellation message on my phone I had problems trying to submit a refund claim through the Ryanair website ( name not matching my booking details etc - - blah blah - - utter nonsense ). However I recently received an EMAIL confirming my flight cancellation which had a link to the cancellation form - no problem sending this , and immediately received an automated reply confirming my request for a refund, stating the time frame in which I would receive it. I printed this confirmation for my records in case I need to follow up at some stage ."
"This is fairly standard with Ryanair, you will now wait a couple of weeks and then receive an email with your voucher code but no refund!"
Thank you Stu902. Just typical of Ryanair!!
"I had been trying for a few weeks to get a refund or contact someone at Ryanair, no luck. Then I got a case number and followup email with a link to access a refund application web page. I applied for a refund at this link and got a 'Thank you for your refund application"" message stating it would take 5-7 days to process and about 20 days to get the refund as they are so busy. Ref: QDI3FRToday I got an email from them trying to get me to take a voucher instead. Their message states "" Customers who do not choose to accept a free voucher or move will receive their refund in due course, once this crisis has passed"".I do not want a voucher Ryanair, I want my money back asap.THIS IS THE UPDATE ON THEIR WEBSITE:Refund UpdateThe processing time for cash refunds is taking far longer than normal as we are processing over 1,000 times the normal volume of cancellations. We also have 75% fewer staff available to process refunds due to social distancing restrictions.Ryanair is offering vouchers and free moves as these are automated and give customers an immediate alternative. Unfortunately, cash refunds cannot be automated. Customers who choose a voucher, but don't redeem it within 12 months may still apply for and obtain a refund after this 12 month period.Customers who choose not to accept a free move or voucher will receive their refund in due course, once this crisis has passed. Over the coming weeks and months, we will be working hard to process refund requests as quickly as we can. We sincerely apologise for these unavoidable refund delays which are due to the unprecedented volume of Govt. imposed flight cancellations and we sincerely thank customers for their patience."
"Thank you so much. I was having issues as well. This has helped me massively.Changing RK to FR - Airline CodeEdited: 4:26 pm, May 15, 2020 "
"I thought legally they had to refund within a certain time, not put us at the bottom of a queue for after the virus subsides?If the money is there it would be quite easy to set up automatic refunds for anyone who wants one. After all, it seems easy enough for them to set it up for us accepting a voucher. This is OUR money and they should not be holding on to it!"
I also think that any of us who accept the voucher and then Ryanair goes bust we will not be entitled to our money back!
"""I thought legally they had to refund within a certain time, not put us at the bottom of a queue for after the virus subsides?""In theory yes, but in practice by the time any legal action had wound its way through courts backlogged by lockdowns and social distancing, your refund would probably have reached the head of Ryanair's queue anyway. It is also possible that courts might regard government imposed lockdown/social distancing as ""force majeure"", so exempting Ryanair, and all sorts of other businesses, from following one law if to do so meant breaking another. If you feel like giving the courts a try, do let us know how you get on."
Hi I have just had a confirmation that my flights Have been cancelled due to travel 19th of June.I have gone through the process of trying to get a full refund it just says try again later does anyone know is this because we aren't due to fly till June even though they have cancelled it ? Thanks in advance.
"We had the same email this morning due to travel 27th June and the link to apply for the refund worked so no nothing to do with your dates, will believe it when I see the refund back on our card.Edited: 10:05 am, May 16, 2020 "
"Burrs, we've all applied for the refund and all got an email asking if we want a voucher. Give it a week or so and you'll get yours!"
"Yep, totally expecting it, same trip flying out with jet2 a month earlier, got email confirmation of refund on Friday, can already see it being actioned on the credit card, expect it to show transaction tomorrow, big difference."
I've a jet2 holiday booked for August so I'm hoping if it is cancelled it'll be just as easy a refund!
"Hi,just to say I had same problem yesterday.I decided to use the Ryanair help centre section which is found on their website in the useful links and info section.If you go through it takes you to another section, choose disruptions and refunds just fill it out and this should work it did for me.Good luck."
It keeps changing the flight number code letters then saying they aren't valid.
Try changing RK to FR in the Airline Code
"Deborah M, could you let us know if you actually receive a refund please or whether it proves to be another merry-go-round?"
Received notice our flights are cancelled this morning and applied for refund.Completed refund application form and submitted but no email back or anything just asked me to print off the refund application details which says thank you for your refund application.Should I not get an email from them?Thanks!
"""Should I not get an email from them?""No, you won't get an email confirmation. You'll get an email wih a voucher in about 7 days (if my experience is anything to go by)."
OK thanks Lexexpress!So they are sending vouchers not refunds even though you request refund?
"Yes bronia, they will tell you your refund is being processed then a few weeks later you will receive an email with a voucher code."
Thanks Stu092!

Hi I have just heard from them asking again would I like to transfer or use another flight instead of a refund. I filled the form refund from 16th of May. On the new email it doesn't say anything about the refund I'm waiting on.
"HiMy flights were cancelled on 27th March and I had to rebook an earlier flight at a cost of £315, that was cancelled less than 24 hours later. I applied for a refund on 24th March and not got it yet, not one person has got a refund since the Outbreak. I have tried every tactic. I have now raised at Section s75 with Amex and they have deposited my money in the credit card account but I have to wait until the end of June just in case Ryanair dispute this transaction, which I am sure they will No employees for refunds but plenty to deal with flight bookings and disputes. Don't expect a quick resolution there is some suggestion it might even be the end of 2020."
Re998my flight is June are cancelled and i filled in form requested refund and just got another email trying to get me to accept a voucher. It says click on a link if you want a refund but when you do there is no option to claim a refund just information on vouchersShould i just sit tight and do nothing or have i got to try and request cash again?
I had the chat open for 6 hours the other day and no reply! I took screen shots incase I need to prove I've tried to get my refund! Fact is I'd asked for a damn refund before they sent the voucher email!
Its a merry go round no chance for months yet
"Im the same. Followed the email link to request a refund on 17th May but have had no confirmation email just what was on screen that I have printed off. Finally got an email from them yesterday just saying this- We sent you an email inviting you to move your cancelled flight for free or apply for a refund. Moving your flight is very easy, there are no change fees, you don’t have to pay the fare difference and you can travel to any destination on our network. No mention at all that I have requested a refund! Its a bit worrying"
Hi exactly the same email. Trouble is how long do you wait! Thinking I might be better trying to get sorted out with the bank. Has anyone else had any joy.?
"I had exactly the same series of emails, last one today offering voucher..I had enough and contacted my credit card bank and filed a dispute under section 75, they will send me a form to complete next week, they said that they will refund my money but it could take them up to 8 weeks as they have back log of similar disputes."
Call your bank and request chargeback for this transaction they will refund you in minutes
Call your bank and request chargeback for this transaction
"So it's been 2,5 months since I filled the refund form. Then I received voucher and in April initiated chargeback. Received money immediately for additional services and later Ryanair replied to Mastercard that they refuse to pay me back because I received voucher. When in fact I refused voucher and again applied for refund. Last week I submitted docs all over again and sent them to my bank to get chargeback for tickets. Day after I received email from Ryanair that my refund request have been processed and I will receive my money within 5-7 days. On 5-th day I received 20 Euros from them when in fact the amount for tickets should be 10 times more. This is all is just the way too annoying. I am still waiting for my chargeback because seems that even if Ryanair say they already refund money in fact it means they didn't.Edited: 5:52 am, June 02, 2020 "
Call your bank and request chargeback for this flight
Received another email saying how easy it is to get a voucher and easy to use. Again it doesn't let you say I ve already asked for a full refund.Apparently they are starting to fly again on number of routes. Would be a good idea to pay everyone back the money they owe us.
NO patience needed. You pay for a service and they cancel a flight. Courtesy and customer service means a refund is warranted. No impatience or patience needed.
Quick update. Managed an online chat and explained I did not want a voucher but a full refund. My money is in a queue and will be refunded ASAP when they can.!!!!
"Do a chargeback with your bank, these guys online are professional liars and are given instructions from the top of Ryanair to delay paying you back"
"I am another who cannot persuade the online refund application form to work. I am not sure that joining the queue of people waiting for Ryanair to find the time and money to make refunds will prove to be worthwhile but it seems the only thing to do short of legal action so I decided to send an e-mail. Nowadays there is an e-mail address, customerqueries@ryanair.com but I wanted to attach the Travel Itinerary which Ryanair provided by e-mail and when I looked at that if you scroll down there is a ""Reply"" button. So I replied to say that my flights had been cancelled; a refund had been offered; followed later by the offer of a voucher; and that I do not accept a voucher and wish to be added to the queue of people awaiting a refund. Talk of a queue is obviously euphemistic but at least I now feel that I have communicated my refusal of the voucher. I suppose it would be naive to wish that Ryanair had included a button saying ""Refuse"" on their e-mail. It would, however, have saved me some time and also kept Ryanair's records tidily in one place."
yes! this is the same for me!
"Some good news and some not yet good news:My daughter received payment from Ryanair this week for her cancelled flight to Rhodes on 1 April, having made her application for a refund as soon as the flight was cancelled, then later receiving a voucher which she phoned up to refuse, then receiving another voucher email which she ignored. My husband had a flight to Riga on 21 March which was cancelled. He claimed a refund by phone because the form wouldn't work. He heard nothing more until this week when he had an email saying he was in the queue, but no timescale. He claimed before my daughter and never received an offer of a voucher (which he didn't want anyway). So mixed story here, but it does seem that you will eventually get your money back, but you may be waiting 3+ months."
To sum up: I received the full paid amount on my cc in 2 transfers from Ryanair.It took almost 3 months to receive the refund. So wishing everyone good luck. Chargeback definitely will make it happen much faster.
Like everyone here after my flights were cancelled back in March I scrolled through forums looking for secret tips to make refund forms work etc. In the end it was the chargeback that worked. I got all my refunds to the different accounts i paid with last weekCharge back works for debit cards and credit cards. It is a very easy process but there is a time limit on when you can use it so don't delay.DO NOT ACCEPT VOUCHERS
"i received my money back! it took 2-3 months.Edited: 1:36 pm, June 21, 2020 "
Great news for you. Was that from Ryanair?
Yes!
Hi - has anyone had a refund yet from Ryanair? My June flight was cancelled. Have applied for refund but realistically I'm not expecting to hear anything for at least 3 months. Thanks
I've been sent vouchers for 2 separate flights. Do I need to contact Ryanair and ask for a refund or will they eventually refund me? I did originally request a refund.
What does the email with the voucher say?
"You have recently received an email with a voucher code to the value of your original booking. Please note that this voucher is valid for 12 months and can be used for your future travel plans. Pleas note if you do not use the voucher before the expiry date you will receive a full cash refund, in the event you use the voucher in part you will also receive the option of a voucher for the balance or a cash refund after the expiry date. Please click on the link below to accept the voucher.I got this email from Ryanair on 30/4/20. It was relating to a trip to Alicante. Thanks for any help/advice."
Do I need to contact Ryanair for a refund for the above?
"If you don’t do anything, or click the link in the email to accept the voucher then that is what you’ve received. By not using the voucher, after a period of 12 months then Ryanair will refund you the value of the voucher."
Sunmagic. Thank you for that. I just was'nt sure about it. I might be able to use the voucher but waiting to see how things go. I assume using the voucher if I decide to do so is straight forward. I don't know anyone who has accepted and used the voucher.Thanks again.S1.
Im having the exact same problem
"Hi! Sorry but I'm having massives problems to use my vouchers, when I insert the voucher number it says this is invalid and had accepted everything through the link they have sent me. What can I do? I'm desperate! Thank you very much"
You'll need to contact Ryanair.
"Through a 3rd party, but Ryanair sent me three different emails with the vouchers...need to sort it..I don't even want a refund, just want to be able to use the vouchers. Thank you"
This is exactly what has just happened to me. I booked it all myself (no third party) and they are now not recognising my reference number when I try to claim. They do not answer the phone or emails. I have wasted a lot of money trying to get through on the phone first thing they open but it just does not answer. Does anyone else have this problem. I do not want vouchers and told them this but I feel this may be the cause of them removing my reference number. I think I may now have to pursue my credit card. This is really shameful of Ryanair
It was easier doing a chargeback with my credit card supplier than waiting for Ryanair to refund me
"woahpaolo,how did you do that? Was your flight Cancelled? Thank you."
"Estefani, was your flight Cancelled, or did you have to Cancel? Atleast they offered you a Voucher. Thank you."
Send them a message through their Facebook chat.https://www.facebook.com/ryanair/…or herehttps:/…contact-us
Iv had same problem there deff scamming people they told me through lock down I’d get refund now saying it’s wrong ref I’m so annoyed there really not being helpful just wants to get you off the phone by repeating sorry mam wrong number taking people’s money and not refunding is disgraceful and wrong ...
I contacted my credit card company. Tried atleast 200 times with form. It was impossible got money back from credit card company. Goodluck
