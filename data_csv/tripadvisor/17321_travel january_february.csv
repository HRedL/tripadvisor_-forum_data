This is my take on the questionsWeather- Yes there could be a typhoon. You may get no rain at all some days but the most likely weather pattern is rain for a short time each day and fine for the rest.Recent Big Storm- Mostly affected Mindanao. Not much affect where you will be travellingRegards: Jim
"Clare,....relax, don't get your pantalones in a bind. If you want translation in English, here's my take on the poster's questions: 1. Traveling- January 17 to February 7, 2012 to Bantayan, Malapascua, and Bohol. 2. Is the weather good during these times? 3. The recent storm (Washi) did a lot of damages and epidemic in these areas?....drinking the eggnogs was just a jest( tongue in cheek with a wink)...lol.... You still have a nice Holiday, ok?Papalo"
Jan and Feb. are my favorite time to travel anywhere in the Philippines including the islands you mentioned. They are just as beautiful as before as they were spared by typhoons.
Thank you. A bit scared typhoon.hoped that the good weather.Merry Christmas to all.
Cebu is rarely hit by typhoons most of the year. There may however come occasionally from june to november. January and February is pretty much vacation weather with a cool breeze from the north and clear skies brought about by the comins summer season. Enjoy your holidays in the Philippines
