Be wary of using Sykes cottages. I booked a cottage in the Isle of Wight for Xmas 2013 for 10 members of my family back in in Jan of this year. Had a call from them at back end of Sept stating cottage was no longer available. They failed to find a suitable alternative & I am lumbered with ferry tickets and the task of finding something suitable at relatively short notice. This has fallen on deaf ears with Sykes who have no intention of remedying the situation. If you're going to deal with Sykes please be wary of them!
I don't think you can blame them - I expect an owner has double-booked or pulled out. YThey cant do much about that.
"I agree with Lutterworthcooper, DO NOT USE Sykes Cottages.We made a booking with Sykes Cottages a couple of weeks ago for a cottage for a weekend mid Dec. Paid up front and got confirmation. Only got told today that the cottage has been double-booked. They were willing to find us an alternative but we would have to pay the addition cost since the alternative cottage was more expensive.Sorry, JWMiddleEngland, I have to disagree with you here ...It's not rocket science ... Sykes Cottages take a booking, they should check with owners straight away for the cottage's availability. If available, book it with the owner and make sure the cottage is secured for those dates. You then go and take payment from clients. Confirm the booking with both owner and your clients. How can someone book a cottage, made the payment and then with just 1 week to go, Sykes Cottages turn round and tell us the cottage has been double-booked? It's basic admin stuff!!!It was supposed to be a get-together for our friend's big birthday. Lots of us have made arrangements in advance. Now it's ruined and we have to come up with a Plan B!!! Thanks Sykes Cottages. You suck!!! Should change the name to Suck Cottages."
"HiI have booked many times with Sykes and have only once found fault and they obviously always take the owners side. My thoughts be very careful with them , perhaps they have grown too quickly"
We are flooded in and cannot get to our booked cottage in north wales. When we contacted Sykes cottages all they could say was no refunds and had we read their terms and conditions. Even if I had read their terms and conditions I doubt it would have stopped us being flooded in!
Your travel insurance might refund you. It's not Sykes Cottages fault you're flooded
Or possibly even your home insurance?
Totally unrealistic stance from both Sykes Cottages and the owners. We are having the worst weather in 200 years and are unable to travel with any certainty. Thanks also for the reply posts which quite obviously only come from cottage owners and Sykes themselves.Edited: 6 years ago 
"Hi,I have never used Sykes Cottages, am not employed by them, do not own a holiday cottage.I do however feel that you cannot really complain about your treatment.Your holiday insurance (I assume you did take out holiday insurance?) should pay out in this case in my opinion."
We are seasoned travellers with holiday insurance through our bank but a claim is unlikely as it is our travel which is affected by the flooding....and yes I do believe that Sykes and the owners could do more...if this were a hotel a 48hour cancellation policy would come into affect...interesting reviews for Sykes are they not?...a large number of disgruntled customers to which we are intending to add momentum...thanks for your concern.
""" a claim is unlikely as it is our travel which is affected by the flooding...""Yes that's what you can claim for. Travel affected by the flooding"
Well thats what we would have all thought but just because it is dangerous to travel between our location and the destination is apparently not a reason for a claim.
"I have never used Sykes Cottages, am not employed by them and do not own a holiday cottage. I'm quite surprised that you would suggest that so many replies would be from those sort of people.Maybe you are over-estimating how much they care about this thread..."
"Glad I found this forum, was just going to book an Easter break with Sykes... Don't think I will bother."
"Well well, Sykes have decided that it would be prudent to give a refund...sense has prevailed...take note the good witch and travel bob."
"I am pleased for you martin that Sykes have decided, out of the goodness of their heart, to refund you."
"""Well well, Sykes have decided that it would be prudent to give a refund...sense has prevailed...take note the good witch and travel bob.""I'm not sure what I've to take note of???"
"have searched long and hard this week to find some means of publicly sharing my absolutely dreadful experience with Sykes. They don't answer emails and I am surprised that they don't monitor - or respond to - what is said about them in forums such as this. Any company that cared about its customers would but my experience is that they don'tthe issue being is that I was trying to book a particular cottage in an area where there aren't many rentals - this cottage was ideal and near to where I wanted to be. I made an enquiry and was told the cottage wasn't available. I looked on sykes' website and it was showing as available on one page and then not available on another - right up to 2015 end (not reasonable). i contacted them again and asked them why the cottage was showing as both availbale and non available for such a long time and they came back and said they don't handle this cottage any more. I then asked them why they were still advertising it on their website, on Holiday lettings (part of Trip Advisor) and on numerous sites elsewhere and they said it was Holiday lettings who didn't update the advertising or the calendars. this is absolutely not true - the company are advertising product that they don't have the right to to do so with now - assuming they did initiallyI then try to book another cottage with them in a similar area. this one is definitely showing as available - but I get an email to say it is not available. they have set changeover days so I try based on those, and again I get an email stating unavailable but on website showing as available. I really don't understand this.On each occasion I have had email back with no availabilty they have sent me details of houses 'nearby that are available'. the nearest being 170 miles away (I am looking at bedford and they are sending me Norwich and Lincoln - even as far as Humberside)I have written a final email asking for an explanation of their untoward marketing approach and disingenuous advertising but have not received any reply. I am not surprisedFinally, reference the person to whom Skyes cancelled their holiday due to a double booking. sykes may have been working to the terms and conditions of that particular booking, but a more normal way of an agent who is there for both rental customer and client is to do have the following in such a circumstance: ie if a property becomes unavailable for whatever reason, an alternative to the same quality or higher will be made available with the agent/owner bearing the cost if the latter. Or of course, client has option to cancel. I am an agent of a large number of properties in Portugal and only twice in ten years a property has not been available due to either urgent maintenance or once for an owner's double booking. in both instances I offered same or enhanced - ensuringthe owner paid the difference as the issue was down to him - and as a result had happy customers who continue to visit each year. Sykes obviously has a different approach and they're certainly not a company that i would deal with after my experience this week - I hope they will do the right thing and answer some of the complaints on this forum as by not doing so it is making their position worse."
"Well thats what we would have all thought but just because it is dangerous to travel between our location and the destination is apparently not a reason for a claim. ======================================================================Well at least Sykes have now refunded you. Out of interest though where was the destination, I'm assuming your location/starting point is Bognor Regis as per your profile ?Edited: 6 years ago "
"If I was a holiday cottage owner and a customer couldn't travel due to this year's flooding I would have given a refund. Not only would the customer be likely to re-book another time, they may become regular customers and spread the word, as they'd have been treated with compassion at a time they needed it most."
"""If I was a holiday cottage owner and a customer couldn't travel due to this year's flooding I would have given a refund"" He didn't say he couldn't, he said it was ""dangerous"", which is a matter of opinion. Given that he claims to be in Bognor, which was not flooded, I'd have to hear a few more details before putting the boot into the cottage company. It may be that he just didn't fancy spending a week in a cottage watching the rain come down.If you were a cottage owner, you would realise that the booking season is very short, there's not much money to be made, and you would be mad to give a full refund at short notice save in exceptional circumstances. If there is flooding but the cottage is accessible, that wouldn't be ""exceptional"" in my book."
I have just booked with Sykes Holidays and have had trouble from the start and I haven't even got to their cottage yet. The staff are rude and unfriendly and their insurance isn't worth the paper its written on. DO NOT USE SYKES COATTAGES. I have booked many cottages each year with many different companies and never had this problem before.
"I am also extremely unhappy with the service I have received from Sykes Cottages.I booked a long weekend in Kent - a scandinavian type lodge it was described as well presented, costing approx £460.We were absolutely appalled by the state of the lodge, it was filthy - cob-webs on the lightshades all the appliances/utensils were filthy, bedsheets were not clean, the kettle was full of limescale - microwave not working - not good when making babies bottles!!!We came home early as we couldnt bare another nights stay - I called Sykes to complain on Saturday they advised for me to speak to the owners Mr & Mrs Marsh. The owners called me back explaining that they use cleaning contractors to clean prior to guests arriving - and they advised me that they will instruct Sykes to give me a full refund!! I took photographs as evidence and STILL have not received a response to my complaint."
"booked Canties cottage through SYKES and had no problems whatsoever had a lovely holiday and would thoroughly recommend it great little cottage ,friendly and helpful host (CHRIS) and idyllic location and garden"
"I would agree that Sykes lean towards the owner. They also do not set any standard regarding the provision of consumable items in the property. We arrived at our cottage from overseas, on the Sunday afternoon before a bank holiday to find the end of the roll of toilet paper, paper towel and no soap at all. There was a dish washer but no tablets.When I spoke to Sykes in regard to another matter and suggested we should get a discount they said that was up to the owner , who promptly said no. We then managed for 4 weeks with the bed linen that was on the bed and 4 towels. Travel insurance is a necessity to avoid any cancellation expenses I am afraid."
"Couldn't agree more, booked a cottage in a village in the Cotswolds on the understanding there was a pub one minutes walk from the cottage, turned out it was closed, had been for a while according to the locals.Sykes cottages reply to my complaint was, owner emailed me address of two pubs outside the village, none of them within walking distance. I had my doubts about their efficiency after I booked the cottage and they kept sending me cottages I may like to rent and only stopped when I finally emailed them and reminded them they had already rented me a cottage. Have nothing to do with them. I will never use them again.Duncan MitchellQueensland Australia"
"Sykes cottages do not take responsibility for misrepresentations of their holiday bookings, instead refering it back to the ownersof the cottages, who ofcourse will not refund any money in the event that you are not satisfied with aspects of the accomodation. We booked Hanging Royd cottage in Huddersfield it was said it was in a village and close to ameities, it was not.... it was on a busy road in a hamlet with nothing... I would not book with them again. It was noisy the whole time with traffic and neighbours rowing!"
"Dont book with Sykes this is the second occasion I have booked with them and they misrepresent the accomodation, and as was this time... the location, we were on a busy road in the middle of nowhere, and had noisy nieghbours rowing, it was a back to back house which they did not tell us. It was not in the village they had said the list goes on but they did not refund any money to compensate."
"Typical of the firm, they take the money then have no interest in any complaints. The cottage I rented from them was also misrepresented which took the edge off of the holiday.Duncan Mitchell"
"I would NEVER recommend anyone to book via Sykes. It is clear they do not inspect the accommodation they advertise and if it is not as advertised or up to standard (even dangerous) they will not take any responsibility, just saying the customer has to deal directly with the owner of the property. This is despite the fact that they advertise the properties, you pay your money directly to them and do not even know who the owner is when you make the contract! (They hide behind the small print of their terms and conditions). Sykes really don't care about dissatisfied customers; the property owners, therefore, don't either since they aren't obliged to pay compensation. I understand the directors of Sykes are ""non-operational"", which simply means they just collect the money and leave their frontline staff to face all the flak from customers who have had a poor holiday experience - frontline staff who are not authorised to make any goodwill gestures/payments."
"Reading some of the above - Count your blessings that you have never had the cause to complain and ask Sykes Cottages for a refund.We booked Little Holme in Eardisley for a week and returned home the same day as the cottage was not as the photographs on Sykes website and was dirty. We confronted the owner who didn't offer to put things right all she had to say was that the cottage had been fully booked all summer and she'd had no negative feedback. Even when confronted with the dead earwig in the filthy cupboard and remarking about the balls of dog hairs on the carpet and cushions she offered nothing only the same statement. Sykes Cottages backed her statement up and disregarded the fact that we had cause to return home. They accept no responsibility for photographs, descriptions or ratings that are years out of date. It is a complete waste of time presenting them with photographic evidence if there has been no negative feedback before. We asked that they insist on the owner removing the present photos which, judging by the rotten exterior and shabby furnishings, are years out of date. Sykes said that it was up to the owner to update their photographs, despite it stating this on their website in the terms and conditions ' 7.2) Upon becoming aware of any material inaccuracies in any published description of the Property or material changes to the Property, the Agent shall endeavour to correct them in future publications and inform the Holidaymaker. The Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, offer the Holidaymaker the option to treat the change as a Cancellation Event and clause 6 shall apply accordingly.' The owner refused a full refund and Sykes Cottages made the amount she offered up to 50% supposedly as a good will gesture which we accepted to avoid any further stress and upset. We will never book another cottage through Sykes Cottages."
"I booked a lovely cottage on Skye for a week over New Year 2014/15 back in august. In early October we found put we would have a new dog by the time of our holiday, and the cottage was no pets allowed. I called and asked to change the booking to a pet friendly property (also one of theirs) which was available. Sykes insisted on retaining my deposit of £180 , despite the fact that there was 10 weeks warning - and I am using another of their properties. Looking forward to my holiday, I am going ahead with the alternative (and have paid another deposit) - however -I think this is unreasonable, will not use Sykes again and will take every opportunity to warn off others."
I have has similar I complained to them about the awful state of a cottage we stayed in in August this year and they are just not willing to compensate us in any way the cottage cost us over 800 for a week. It was called Capal Iago in Llanbydder Wales. I would never book with Sykes cottages ever again !!
"The cottage we booked looked lovely on the photos, however the reality is very different. It smelt musty and damp. It was dirty and covered in spiders and webs and moths. In fact it was arachnid heaven !! The front of the cottage shown in the photos is not allowed to be used by guests. O no you have to walk up crumbling stone steps at the side of the house. The forth bedroom is advertised as having narrow steps leading to it, rubbish its a loft ladder. There is a rusty old plough right where the kids and dogs play its awful. When we complained about our £800 holiday we have been basically called liars by sykes cottages and offered no compensation. Avoid them like the plaque!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Or even the plague!
"Glad I found this was just about to book through them I did wonder why there prices were so much cheaper than airbnb and other places guess I now know why, aybe trip advisor should remove them as well"
Im anxious to retrn to Cardoc Court studio Ross-on-wye but the owners have sold up and gone have the new ones registered this pad with you perhaps ?
"Hi I'm a cottage owner an iv used Sykes cottages for the last 12 months there great when everything is going okay and there raking the cash in but as soon as there's a glitch, there business acumen is non existent OWNERS BEWARE THIS COMPANY IN MY HUMBLE OPINION *WILL TAKE YOU TO THE CLEANERS * WHEN YOU WANT TO LEAVE THEM. Unfortunately I'm living proof."
Sykes customer service not helpful have been told as nobody else has ever complained about the cottage they find it hard to believe!!!!! That I have !!thay have spoken to the owner who says there is no problem however they informed me that he was away and has not been to check out the cottage himself no heating or hot water
"I can only assume these guests are trying to get a refund of some sort as we have always had our phone numbers prominently displayed at the cottage WHY DIDN'T THEY RING ?.. Also they rang me 3 days before arrival so they had my numbers before they come as do all our guests, the heating is on constantly maybe the thermostat on the radiators needed turning up if they rang me I could of come and done this simple task for them I can't fix a problem if I don't know about it. Hot water ? Try pulling the cord in the shower there electric instant hot water, again a phone call would have sorted it.I'm disappointed about this reviewAmanda"
"You would have to be joking Amanda, a refund from Sykes cottage. watch for the flying pigs."
"Oh how I wish I had seen this review of Sykes Cottages before we booked with them. We had an awful holiday in one of their cottages!! When we first arrived and phoned Sykes to complain about the property they really didn't want to know. So initially we sorted something out with the owner of the cottage who turned up to welcome us!!!Following a horrendous week, we went back to Sykes to seek compensation for all the money we spend cleaning the place, staying in to wait for plumbers etc and they were not at all interested. Kept saying they were ""just agents"" and in law we had no contract with them"". Moral - NEVER USE A LETTING COMPANY - GO DIRECT....."
"Do not take out sykes holiday insurance unless you live abroad,I paid the £18 and I live 100 mies from the cottage I rented in north walesThey couldn't advise or tell you what insurance was for,I took out as im disabled and I didn't get confirmation email,till 26.jan 2015.the holiday was for the 30.1/2015 to 6/1/2015..I asked for it to be posted outbut with only having 3 days to read it and 2 hospital apt before my holiday,i could not read till I was away,then I found out ,it only covered you if your holiday was over £3001 ,I paid £302.if id fallen ill ,as I am quite often do with having had several heart attacks,thery wouldn't have paid out anywayThe on line call/switchboard don't even know what the insurance is for,I asked would I be able to claim if I fall il,i got the reply ""yes"",,if I had they wouldn't have paid out,BEWARE DO NOT TAKE OUT THEIR INSURANCE OUT.ON RINGING THEM TODAY THEY REFUSED A REFUND OF THE INS PAYMENT.SURLEY THERE ARE LAWS TO WIPE OUT COLD SELLING OF INSURANCE POLICIES,THEY DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SELLING IN 1ST PLACE!DONT DO IT IF UR HOLIDAYS IN UK!

"I'm not sure where you get this £300 from they seem to have different levels of cover for the price of the holiday www.sykescottages.co.uk/uk-insurance.htmlI'm just looking to book a cottage with them, I enquired through owners direct but got a reply from Sykes, there are 2 reviews for the cottage on trip advisor, both very complimentary on the cottage."
"I paid 302 for the holidayit was 3001 that they covered fromI rang the insurance brokers up and they said sykes should have given the ins companies tel no when booking,,not by post,,tho I booked the holiday about 3weeks b4 hand and didn't get a letter till the 26th jan confirming everythingcouldn't read till I was away on the holiday,as I had two cadiac apt that week b4 going!I went thru sykes and I wouldn't know how to contact the owners directly!"
"I have had a terrible experience wih Sykes Holiday Cottages and would not recommend them. After booking a cottage through them and receiving the worse service. Pew arrived at our cottage at the recommended time to find that the cottage had not been cleaned, therefore I phoned Sykes to inform them and they said that they would contact the owner and get back to me. After waiting an hour to hear back from Sykes I phoned the, again to see what was happening - only to be informed that they were unable to get in touch with the owner and not to worry as they were open until 9pm. However, this was a Friday evening in winter and I had 2 small children, a baby and dog to look after and explained that waiting in a dirty cottage with a young family was not acceptable. After asking what the procedure was for things like this happening I was told I could travel home with my family or they would look for accommodation. After waiting in the dirty property and after my family had travelled more than 4 hours for our family holiday to celebrate my 30th birthday we were moved at 7pm to a lower star property in Whitby when we had booked to stay in Robin Hood. After moving to a lower star property, over 4 floors with 1 bathroom we said that we would discuss this with Sykes on Monday (after our holiday)When I phoned on the Monday I was informed that I would be refunded the difference between the 2 cottages, after a number of phone calls I was then offered £100 compensation- however after being charged more for the 2nd property than my 1st quoted, charged an additional booking fee and for insurance I phoned the company again to question my refund, only to be told that the cottage I had bookec 6 months ago had now gone down in price so the difference I would receive would be less along with being charged more for the 2nd property. After over a week do phone calls and no apology I lgave up fighting with the company as they found it acceptable for the service I had received and that it was Also ok to provide incorrect information and not honour the information and prices provided. Again I would like to highlight what a terrible service we received and hope for the future Sykes have better policies and procedures in place to prevent this from happening, to provide a better service and to either honour information provided or to provide the correct information in her 1st place."
Holiday insurance is important to have. Credit card insurance is not the best and sometimes you have to have booked all the holiday using the card. If you travel more than once a year and use planes an annual insurance can be worthwhile. Double booking is the fault of the owner and/or the agent. You should have a refund without deduction and without question. PROVIDING the T&C says so. Read it first before booking.Edited: 5 years ago 
"yes they can as a holiday letting agency they should have plans in place for this kind of thing, what I did not like about them, is the fact that they just don,t care about their customers !"
"Hello there, I've recently had to book a get away with several old school friends at a lovely cottage that we found online and mutually agreed on. Some of the friends are quite a liability so we checked prior to booking about their safety when they might be impaired during our stay. I spoke to a softly spoken young girl called Marika/Marka? who had vast knowledge about the cottages and safety of them. We don't want any broken hips do we! Great service.10/10 would visit again, thanks to Marika/Marka for the helpWill E.(Aged 69)Edited: 5 years ago "
Glad to have found this info. We want to rent a cottage in September. Does anyone have suggestions of what company to use since Sykes is apparently awful.thank you.
We booked a cottage through Sykes...... Never again customer support non existent ...Helpful they don't know the meaning.......Obnoxious uncaring rude they are. Thankfully the owner of the property sorted our problem himself. Please beware of this company.
Try owners direct. As it says you book direct with owners and have there contact info. Good luck.
"Will do! Thanks so much. We r excited about seeing Northern England , especially Alston. My Grandfather left there for N.B. Canada over a century ago and I've never visited."
I booked a holiday cottage with Sykes Cottages online. After I had booked I went straight back onto the site and right enough the date I had booked was showing unavailable. Happy Days. Only to be called 5 days later by Sykes to say that my holiday hadn't gone through somehow. Even though they had taken the deposit from my credit card account. Be very weary. I think they must have either a scam on. Or a very very poor website
I rented a cottage through them and the property was not as described. Did nothing to remedy this. Beware of using them
"I noticed recently that Sykes is giving away free stays to bloggers who promise to leave a positive review. This happened in the first week of March 2015 and the blogger is all over twitter and the blogspace pushing the brand. This is often a sign that a holiday operator of any kind is scraping the barrel for positive recommendations. I know they let out private cottages and that's a difficult game, but paying people to review is beyond the pale. In this case, the blogger who reviewed is constantly recommending sub-standard products and services."
If you are not sure about a booking website why not try to find the property on goog. Or use Goog earth or Goog Maps as the property often is marked on there. You can then telephone directly the owner. That's what I do and so far have never had a problem. Usually no money up front either.
"I agree, if you couldn't go to your holiday abroad because your house was flooded. the airline wouldn't refund you nor your hotel or self catering accommodation. why would you expect sykes to? the owner of the cottage wouldn't have time to re book their cottage so would lose out also. you would have to do what you would do if travelling abroad and claim on holiday or home insurance. and im not an owner or anything to do with sykes either"
"I can't understand why Sykes cottages can't be banned from Trip Advisor. I sent an enquiry about a particular cottage, and they didn't give the information I requested. On the other hand, I have ever since been plagued by them sending promotions to my inbox. I am furious, and Trip Advisor ""help"" were totally uninterested. I have asked them to stop twice to no avail. I see no option other than to cancel my TA account. When companies spam your own email inbox, you can either junk them or just unsubscribe but with TA you cannot do either. I will never rent a cottage from Sykes."
I am glad I saw all of this have booked a great cottage through Air BNB the people responded everyone has been great
You know what people like you who go round correcting other peoples spelling mistakes really need to GO GET A LIFE !! I couldn't care bloody less REALLY !!!
"to mrbristol1. As a recent cottage owner I am about to book with Sykes. Almost all the bad reviews have been from people looking for accommodation. After reading your review, as someone who lets rather than stays in cottages, I think I'll try somewhere else. Can you recommend any other holiday cottage agencies?"
"This morning I received an invite from Sykes to vote them the best cottage rental company. You're kidding!!!We rented a cottage in Somerset a few years ago. It was a perfectly nice cottage apart from one thing. The endless trains that passed the end of the garden. Starting at stupid o'clock in the morning. That, along with the lumpy uncomfortable mattress, was a recipe for a very unrelaxing holiday. The comment that there was a pub in walking distance was a joke. Yes there was if you were happy walking along a very narrow road, single file, squashing yourself against the verge for fear of getting hit by a car. I wrote to Sykes when I returned home, only to be ignored. After several emails I rang them. Only to be spoken to quite rudely and very unsympathetically. I felt their description of the cottage and it's surroundings were not correct and potential customers should be made more aware of the trains. They were not your normal passenger trains but diesel trains, carrying cargo. Noisy is an understatement. Holidays are precious and can't be wasted on unsatisfactory accommodation."
"To Debbie S I was about to entrust my holiday cottage lettings to Sykes Cottages when, by chance, I came across the comments under this topic. I then read, carefully, their 11-page Terms and Conditions, which leave the owner with little recourse if anything goes wrong. I've had a lucky escape."
I'm an owner with sykes cottages..no problems.plenty of bookings and very prompt payment. And who ever you let it with..you and your guests are responsible. Not the booking agent.
"Your terms state 'Once the Initial Payment has been made and a Holiday Confirmation has been issued by the Agent, a legally binding contract shall exist between the Holidaymaker and the Property Owner pursuant to which the Property Owner will make the Property available for the period set out in the Booking.'"
"Edie's Cottage - Sykes Cottages.Paid my deposit in full. Got confirmation receipt for a booking over Christmas.Phoned up and double checked. All OK.Two weeks later get an e-mail from Sykes Cottages stating that the owners have changed their mind and wish to use the cottage themselves.The terms state 'Once the Initial Payment has been made and a Holiday Confirmation has been issued by the Agent, a legally binding contract shall exist between the Holidaymaker and the Property Owner pursuant to which the Property Owner will make the Property available for the period set out in the Booking.'Reading the terms on your web site how can it be possible for your client to cancel the booking? I don't think this is Sykes issue and more like unprofessional owners however Sykes needs to keep these guys under control. Either they are renting their properties or they are not. In this case, they shouldn't!"
"i would not use Sykes cottages again, earlier this year we booked a cottage in Wales because of family commitment we couldn't make it so we asked could we change the date, a very unhelpful woman,( she was quite abrupt ) agreed to change the date to September, because it was dearer in May than September we was told in no uncertain terms we will have to pay the May charge in case the Cottage was not let out, we went in September the cottage was let out on the date we should have gone in May, so we rang Sykes cottages up about a refund , we was told NO BECAUSE THE COTTAGE OWNERS HAD ALREADY GOT THE MONEY fair enough but it was the way we was told that we couldnt get a refund , if they had been appoligetic we would have said ok but they where nasty we was told it was a good will gesture ( that cost us £35 )that they changed our date. so we wont be using Sykes cottrages again"
"I'm sopping for self catering accommodation in Bangor area right now. Went through few Sykes offers, which seemed suitable. Thanks to OP and to everybody who'd shared their unpleasant experiences, I won't bother shopping through Sykes...Yuri."
"Booking with Holiday Lettings meant that you booked with the owner of the property, however it now appears that Sykes Cottages seems to have control over most of the U.K. listings - Anyone know why this is?Instead of a 2 night minimum stay (which most of us want if fitting in a weekend away between working) it now states ""short stays welcome"" which translates into a 3 night minimum payment. Some properties state short stays welcome but then the weekly charge is applied regardless of how many nights you select. Have property owners been approached and put onto Sykes books?I don't want to deal with Sykes Cottages, I want to book through the owner via Holidays Lettings."
As a former Owner with Sykes - what a nasty spiteful bunch of people Sykes are.We have recently sold our Cottage ( September) and in the contract for sale we arranged with the new owner to honour the booking and we passed across the money and we told Sykes. Sykes have today rang to see if we have sold our Cottage ?? and tried to cancel with the guest and given out some horrendous lies to the guest - NASTY SPITEFUL AGENCY.They never look after the Owners - horrible!There are lots of other agencies who respect the Owner - but not Sykes.
"We are looking at using Sykes as a letting agency for our cottage so I read the reviews on here with interest, I have to say quite a few of them seem a bit unreasonable, where people have made a booking then want to change it ( the dates/bringing a dog etc) or cant make it. There are others where the cottage wasn't as described and it sounds like Sykes need to up there game in that respect and get out and visit them, but they can hardly be expected to inspect after every clean before a visitor arrives. My understanding is that Sykes offer a booking and advertising service, for owners that would prefer someone experienced to do the admin, mainly for fear of getting it wrong or double booking (its a bit of a responsibility when someone's holiday is at stake). Maybe its just needs to be made clearer who is responsible for what? And for all those people who had problems was it not better that there was a company to ring? Rather than just the owner who might not be available? I'm still undecided wether or not to use this company....."
"I was pretty disappointed with Sykes when looking for a holiday booking. We wanted a booking that had a one day overlap with another week but the only quotes we got back from Sykes was for a ridiculous amount.(Two weeks in fact)These rentals did specify shorter lets but there just didn`t seem to be any human interaction in the quotes, just what ever the computer spat out. No feedback, follow up or negotiation.Had to go to a lot of trouble finding a rental that didn`t involve Sykes as we found them so inflexible. They certainly have a lot of cottages on their books."
"We had a similar event.. We had four families booked into a Sykes property. With 10 days to go we were informed by phone by Sykes that they were no longer dealing with the owner of the property and would email a refund form which also negated all contractual commitments. We asked if the owner was going to honour our holiday dates and the said they didn't know and we would have to contact him. The lady on the phone was quite indifferent to our situation and quite frankly didn't give a hoot that people had booked flights, taken time off work and were travelling from the east midlands up to northern Scotland. Some 5 hours later the gentleman that owned the property contacted us explaining he had decided to leave Sykes to manage the property himself and that he was more than happy to honour all existing bookings and give us the percentage off our total that he was paying to Sykes. The thing here is.... he told Sykes he was honouring all bookings and would be contacting all concerned and in the subsequent conversations we had with Sykes they never mentioned this. In that five hours we were trying to find new accommodation, checking on insurance for cancelled flights etc ...all very stressful and totally unnecessary if Sykes had been a little more focused on 17 people who thought had lost their holiday rather than being nasty and spitefully childish to an ex client I would not be writing this."
"we used Sykes cottages in February, it was interesting that they didn't post our slightly negative review on their web site for the cottage we used. They also didn't comment on it either!"
"Why I would never use Sykes Holiday Cottages to book a holiday cottage:1) They told me on the phone that the cottage I was trying to book was no longer on the market, explicitly lying to me when querying the difference between 'on the market' and 'no longer listed with Sykes'. The cottage was indeed still available, just with another agent.2) They used social engineering techniques to keep me on the phone and push me to another property which I did not want, becoming extremely pushy when trying to politely end the call.3) They took my email address and lied to me when I asked what they would use it for, specifically stating that it would only be used for the booking (which I did not make) and that it would not be used for marketing (which it has been twice less than 24 hours since I called them).If you are looking for a holiday cottage I would strongly recommend that you look for an alternative agent."
Sykes cottages only want your money;My mother booked a cottage last year for us all but she passedaway before we could go.It was four months in advance and Sykes probably let the cottage anyway.We contacted them and were just told no refund not a sorry or anything.To add injury I get e mailsasking me to book again;Perhaps I can claim on the house insurance like a few idiots seem to thing in answer to other posts
They aren't stupid. Some house insurance policies do cover holiday cancellation - ours does.
"I have always championed Sykes Cottages, since staying in the Barn Cottage , near Hexham after xmas with my mum.I am at present on holiday in mid Wales, was staying in 1 Penrhybach, but had to be relocated because of fuel leak and squirrels doing a tap dancein the loft every evening. ( The cottage was lovely. Large and beautiful setting...Fab garden )I was offered 2 alternatives, one very close to where I was but would cost me another £90, and another not really in the area that I had chosen . I was shocked that they were going to charge me as it was through no fault of my own and I had not slept for 2 days. Now in a lovely cottage, however,not in my chosen area. However, after reading some feedback on Sykes Cottages, it seems this is a regulsr occurance.I doubt I will promote Sykes Cottages anymore, or even choose to book with them again.Joanie Wilkinson"
"We have just had the Sykes Cottages experience too.We've booked accomodation with them before but it's true that you only find out how good a company is when something goes wrong.My wife booked a holiday cottage online on 7th June and received confirmation that she had booked the house and would receive further details.On 21 June, we still hadn't heard anything. She phoned them to be told they didn't have her booking and the house had been booked by someone else.Fortunately she had taken a screen shot on her phone so had proof that we had been told our booking and the confirmation existed. They asked her to email these to them. Several calls and having to email the items again, and promises to get back to her have failed.We had booked for 2 July and were understandably concerned we weren't going to get anything. They didn't seem to see any urgency in the problem and all the time, houses we might have liked to book instead, were getting booked by others. We looked to other providers of holiday homes and have booked a house and are looking to forward to our holiday as far away from Sykes Cottages as possible.Not a good experience. They come over very friendly but don't measure up when there is problem and their web site and conditions of service have no facility for compalining about their service, only about the holiday home, if you're actually lucky to get one.Our view now is Sykes suck and we won'tl be back!"
"Hi, I've just had a terrible experience with Sykes. Similar situation.......Customer service is awfulJoanie Northampton"
This forum has made for some very interesting reading! I have a large house on the edge of the peak district which sleeps 10 and was going to register the property with Sykes.....now i am not so sure!...can anybody recommend any other agencies please. t.ia.
Owners Direct?
"Anyone looking to book with Sykes would be better to do a bit of googling and find the owners website and book direct. I've read a lot lately about bad service to both customers and owners by Sykes.Sam M, I will message you a website that might help you."
"Very interesting reading this. We returned to a property in The Lakes (Esthwaite Farm) in June that we had been going to for years on end. The owners changed the running over to Sykes and in the space of three months the whole property had become tatty and unloved.We complained about what we found, i.e broken furniture etc, on our return- but nobody was interested, neither the estate or Sykes. In fact, they had the cheek to simply use my email address for marketing and spamming purposes!The price of the property for 2017 has ballooned and there is no way we will return now knowing how well maintained the property was previously and what it is like now. Sadly we have no confidence that the agents will keep the property in decent repair."
"I'm disappointed in the service from Sykes and the owner of a cottage in Wales rented. The place was filthy:4 adults and a 2 year old stayed; clean linen and comfy beds.The place though was very, very dirty; it needs an intensive clean. Floors, walls, skirting boards, tiles, work tops, tables are greasy, stained and grimy from many previous guests. The stairs were dusty and dog hairs in abundance. The toilet and shower floors were dusty, and had hair everywhere and cobwebs in the corners. The lounge area had food crumbs, dust and hair beneath all tables and sofas; the underside of chair legs were sticky with dirt and more hair. We even found a half eaten apple beneath one settee. Very poor response from owner when this was reported. The towels were all thin with limited room to dry these; towels bleach stained too. Washing machine and tumble all dirty and fluff from previous occupants everywhere. The hoover was appalling with hair coating the rollers, not emptied and dirt and fluff inside the suction area. we had to clean this and the high chair before using. Sorry so negative; dirtiest place I have ever stayed.Sykes were reluctant to get involved and check our claim and I am waiting now, after 5 days, for a response to my complaint. They seemed so professional ....."
"I have used Sykes on three occasions now and after renting two fantastic cottages have just had my first bad experience, not so much with Sykes but with the cottage owners. The cottage (flat) I booked recently in Hutton le Hole in North Yorkshire is above a coffee shop, which I was aware of, but I was not advised by Sykes that the coffee shop clientele would be spilling out near the entrance to the flat on a daily basis, nor that the coffee shop loo is situated just next to the inner door to the flat! This made for some interesting encounters when leaving or arriving back at the cottage with my family of five in total. Pots and pans in the property suited a party of two rather than five and we didn't eat out every night so that was a pain. And it became obvious from the mid-90s style of furniture and decor - not obvious from Sykes website photos - that this was a charming but fairly unloved flat that has had little upkeep in recent years. Still, it is set in a picturesque village, convenient for us as I had relatives to visit in nearby York.On our return from holiday we were slightly vexed to be contacted by Sykes who said the owners were asking for £150 for damage to a foldaway bed, which we were unaware of and totally dispute. We were also questioned about how many guests had used the cottage, implying that perhaps we had over-occupied. Sykes haven't pushed the issue as they merely manage bookings and were passing on a message from the owners and we have made it clear to Sykes we will not be paying for supposed damage that - if it did exist - could be considered wear and tear or something the owners can recoup from their insurers or absorb as a cost to their business.Just be aware that some cottage owners are great and others not so great; there will be the odd bad experience which simply cannot be anticipated and shouldn't spoil an otherwise good holiday. It hasn't put me off using Sykes again but I will ask more questions in future before booking. And bringing loads more loo rolls on the drive over - the stingy owner only left one for the five of us and there's no grocery shop for miles!"
"Yes, Sykes Cottages appear to be a rip off. The actual prices are more than double that estimated on tripadvisor for the given dates! Beware as definitely misrepresenting selves - saying 'Great news your rental available' with no acknowledgement price more than double!!! They seem to have taken over lots of previously independent sites - looks like they are trying to corner the market - keep searching and avoid Sykes as there is better priced accommodation out there!"
"Wish I'd seen this a couple of months ago! We recently stayed in a cottage in Cornwall booked through Sykes. The cottage was nice but there was someone living in a large shed in the garden! We've complained to Sykes via email who have said they're looking into it, but no further contact for the last week."
"30 December - NEW YEARS TRIP - 2 houses, shared pool, 18 people.They just called and cancelled one of the houses, as they have pulled it off their programme.Watch this space..............................................."
"I booked and paid for in full a cottage through Sykes Cottages, a week after receiving my confirmation they phoned me and said they could not honour the booking and suggested I try another cottage, i found a replacement, went thru the booking process, received confirmation again of the booking being paid, confirmed the travel arrangement, today they phoned me again to say that they were cancelling the booking.So now three weeks later there are no more cottage available. Don't use Skyes Cottages or Hogans as they are the same. Wonder how hard it will be to get the payments returned to me.Thanks Sykes for the shocking service"

"Another Sykes holiday, we had booked a cottage through Sykes cottages, then booked flights and car rental, all appeared to be fine. 4 days before travelling Sykes cancelled the cottage and was unable to offer a replacement of similar specification, the cancellation by Sykes cost me hundreds of pounds to which I am going to lose, I would urge everyone thinking of using Sykes to read all previous post regarding this company"
"Why are they still trading?Actually, are you sure there is nothing you can do? I wouldn't give up that easily.Edited: 3 years ago "
"This is a rogue company that hides behind 'booking agent' and the contract is with the cottage owner, we need to publicise this as much as possible and if everyone knows what their like human nature will takes it's course, money is their object, hurt them in the pocket."
"Well, first, it's amazing how many people just lie down and take it! I think you should check out your legal rights. I think Which had a good guide on what to do about holiday lets that went bad. I had problems with a private renter a while back, and I wrote letters and all sorts. Eventually, months later, we got some of our money back.Secondly, I wish Trip Advisor would take a more hands on role with their members. So many people have fallen foul of Sykes and yet they still advertise on the TA site!"
"I have used ""Owner's Direct"" in the past and things have gone smoothly but after reading this thread, I now ignore those properties that also show the Sykes Cottages logo."
We recently stayed in two sykes cottages both were a disappointment.They were advertised as 5 ticks so we assumed they would be of a comparable standard similar to other cottages we stayed in.approximatly 100 in recent years..If this company was in New Zealand they would likely. be had for false misleading advertising.The Lilacs in Broadway was not acceptable .The advertised WiFi didn't work .we were given 2 access codes both useless.The kitchen was inadequate no dishwashing fluid. No provision or access to washing facilities. Wc had the tail end of a toilet roll no replacement provided. The lighting was discussting half the bulbs were missing or didn't work the other half were at best 1 candle power each This is taking power saving to the extreme.The 5pm checkin time is rediculous ln winter darkness this place would be impossible to find in its unllit lane location .this could be a blessing Avoid Sykes if possible.
"I've read that Sykes are on the side of owners? I don’t think so. They're on the side of Sykes. The comments below are my own opinion and purely based my own experience with Sykes as a cottage owner. Did you know that if a booking is cancelled by the guest after the balance has been paid the guest forfeits their whole holiday payment (as per the Sykes T&Cs). Fair enough you might say, but then if Sykes re-books your property (which they are very keen to do) they then keep 100% of the re-booking money; not just their fees but the entire amount received from the second booking. The owner gets zero for the new booking, the original guest gets zero back. So, to summarise, Sykes gets all their commission and booking fees from the cancelled booking and you keep the balance. Sykes also gets and keeps the commission, fees and balance from the second booking as well. A tidy little earner wouldn’t you say?If you query this they will tell you that you, the owner , has already been paid from the first booking. True you say, but so have Sykes so what is the justification for trousering the entire payment for a very small amount of extra admin and the owner is held to ransom by Sykes? If that sounds a bit dramatic, let me explain.As the owner with a Sykes cancellation you would in theory be better off having the cottage empty, having the day off and putting your feet up. After all, you’ve been paid. Except you can’t do that because if you don’t agree to take a second booking (at no extra gain to you remember), or if you re-book the property yourself you have to repay the entire amount from the first booking. Now, I’m not advocating the practice of getting double fees at the expense of guests – far from it. A fair and ethical policy which is widely used, certainly by me and by many other owners, is to refund at least some of the money to the guest who has cancelled if the property is re-let. As it stands, Sykes gets a very handsome, more than double payment for the same letting period.There is also something niggling me about the legality of it; that Sykes as an agency should be working as intermediary between guest and owner and surely when the owner is cut out of the equation, (i.e. they’ve received their money from cancelled guest ) that changes the contract with guest number two. Why do I still have any obligation towards the new guest when I am not receiving any money from them? You will get nowhere with Sykes if you pursue this with them as I have tried. You won’t find it explained in their copious legalise T&Cs and they won’t (can’t) justify the practice, they will just keep repeating the mantra that it is the policy and it isn’t going to change. I have now left Sykes (that's a whole other minefield but I won't go into it here) because I don’t like the way they do business. In my humble opinion, charging hefty fees and exploiting their owners and customers is just unethical. I prefer to treat my guests with respect and fairness to both sides, especially when things go wrong and they have to cancel a holiday. I would like to alert other owners thinking of signing with Sykes to this practice so that they are fully aware of the way they operate before they sign up with this company.I would also strongly advise you to look up cottage owners' own websites and book directly with them if you are considering booking with Sykes. You'll save yourself a fortune in booking fees, commission and possibly VAT too."
Its probably because the owner double booked it and didnt tell Sykes. Sykes Owners can also advertise on TripAdvisor for instance and get a booking but dont update their Sykes calendar. I have a cottage on Sykes and it happened to me once when I got an online booking from TripAdvisor and went to update Sykes an hour later and in the meantime got an online booking from Sykes. If a booking is made on Sykes system it cant be double booked by them. These things happen unfortunately and also if you book direct with the owners who deal with multiple enquiries from guests - many of whom say they will send money for a reservation but it never turns up.
"Oh dear, I'm thinking of going with Sykes to manage my holiday cottage! After reading all these reviews I am reconsidering. I do wonder though if it's just that people who have had good experiences just wouldn't bother commenting? Anyway, can anyone recommend an alternative site to go with?"
"ditsydaisy, I have sent you a message."
"Thanks Trillian, I have replied :)"
Thanks Riever for the information.<<I would also strongly advise you to look up cottage owners' own websites and book directly with them >>I agree.........and by telephone wherever possible to avoid being redirected to Sykes.I wonder if the owners actually realise what is going on here? A call to alert them might save other holidaymakers.
"We booked a ""cottage"" with Sykes. The property was ""as described"" and in fact exceeded our expectations. So we weren't oversold by Sykes. The Admin was easy. Can't comment as to how Sykes would have dealt with us if the property we rented suddenly was unavailable as that didn't happen to us.In short we had a very good experience but as noted above we haven't previously commented."
Try Cottages.com 98% of guests would use them Again!
"i would use sykes again,,its just their insurance policy only covered holiday prices over £3001....i paid £302 ...so was not covered if anything happened i do not know wether this has changed since?..they sare very helpful in finding properties for you and finding out things,,i was just annoyed the way they took insurance premium,,i wasnt covered .i asked for a refund but they refused..as as i said before the ins was only for holidays taken out with them ove three thousand and one pounds...mine was just three hundred and two pounds..."
"That's a good idea, we booked a cottage for Twelve people for August 2018 up in The Peak District but after reading the reviews we are very concerned. There are only Eight of us but the extra space gave room for grandparents to have time out. Thinking about cancelling and looking else where now."
Do you still have your house that you rent out? We booked one on Sykes in the Peak District yesterday but after reading all these reviews we are going to cancel because the last thing we need is a dirty holiday home as we've already had that twice in the past. The house we booked is at Bradnop near Leek and we were booking for August 2018.
I will take a look after reading all these bad reviews.
"Just had same thing happen to meThese things happen but they have made no effort to apologise, or find me something else, they really couldn't care less. Don't take the risk"
We've cancelled and going to a lodge instead with hoseasons.
"I am an owner of a cottage let by Sykes,I can tell you they NEVER take the owners side. Sykes is greedy we too get charged a hefty fee for double booking even if it admin don't have a clue what's going on and are sometimes rude.The commission they charge us owners to rent out our cottages is an exorbitant 25% it's ridiculous, especially when they're just sitting behind a laptop and us owners are doing all the work.Anywsy we don't use them anymore as they have become greedy and too big for their boots. A tip,always, always try book with the owner, it's usually much cheaper ."
"They represent cottages that were built before the age of the car, and we have found parking is a constant problem. They don't check this out. I had to cancel a holiday because of parking problems and that cost me money. We stick with people like Hoseasons as they cater for the modern world. I've emailed Sykes about this, but they aren't bothered."
"<<I've emailed Sykes about this, but they aren't bothered>>Trouble is they probably know you won't book with them again but that someone else might and so on it goes.Perhaps a letter to the local Tourist Board would receive more attention? If enough people complain then the Tourist Office personnel might investigate further."
"Beware of creditcard fraudDo not give this company your credit-card details including the 3 figure security code on the phone. My wife did and it was the only transaction for months on that particular card. A few days after the fraudulent uses started to build up, all on line orders. Asda, Domino Pisa's, Next etc. Up to £1000.- until Barclaycard closed the account. I cannot be 100% sure that they, or their personnel were responsible but as far as I am concerned it is a clearcut case as it was the only transaction for month, there is no other explanation.I told them my trust in them had disappeared and I would not be able to use their finance arrangements again. I had paid the deposit for a cottage in Cornwall.The company informed me that if I did not come with concrete proof, the holiday cancellation clause would come in operation and I would loose the amount paid. £273 pounds down the drain which we can ill afford."
"- 1 could the owner of Explorer House Pool Dorset please contact me or help ? when you hear the situation your understand please ? xAwful people , they are saying they will not refund the full deposit even if they resell the holiday. insurance wont cover it and they are simply corporate greedy company, and customer services just say we don;t have to refund you so we may give you something back, so we loose 653 after a horrendous event and they are so greedy they will not refund the full amount even if they resell holiday. and gave 4 months notice. horrible company. Will be going to a Small claims court even though im under extreme distress they are making me suffer more. DON'T TOUCH THEM, CON CON CON"
I abhor their Ryanair booking tactics. Sykes are bully boys selling holiday insurance. Full rental upfront? Wouldn't touch it insurance or no insurance.
"********************WARNING!********************************My partner was taken into hospital a few days prior to our holiday requiring surgery and S***s cottages would not negotiate or allow us to pay extra to change dates or provide a limited refund. Possibly the worst company I've ever done business with. Please note, the owners of the cottage were much more considerate but were at the whims of S***s Cottages. I will never do business with them again."

"We booked our family holiday through Skyes Cottages website in April. (Saoirse Cottage, Ennistymon 08th-15th July 2017). We were informed on Friday past (26thMay2017) that the cottage was double booked. How can this be? We clearly booked it. All seemed fine. It appears that holiday home owners just cherry pick who they rent to, placing their properties on numerous sites without concerns for those families who they turn down. How frustrating."
"Here's another farce, they won't let you contact owners until you have made a firm booking!"
"It's more likely that Sykes double booked it, not the owner. Most owners have calendars they can update on multiple sites, but Sykes acts as an agent and does things their own way. If you find a cottage you like, try googling it to see if owners have their own website and mention that you would rather book direct, rather than through an agent, who charges a huge cut. You might even get a small discount if you mention that you know you're saving the owners a bit of money."
"We booked a week at Pebble Lodge in Padstow, Cornwall, from 21 - 28 May, 2017. Unfortunately 3 days before we were to travel my husband became ill and we had to cancel. Although Sykes were sympathetic toward my husband, they were however unsympathetic with regard to reimbursing us. We lost £530. I tried another route by calling the owner of Pebble Lodge. Unfortunately there was less sympathy there than Sykes. In fact Mrs. K. Smith (the owner) tried to convince me she was the cleaner of the lodge. Absolutely disgraceful. Did we take out travel insurance? No we didn't. Had we planned for my husband to be sick then of course we would have. Who takes out travel insurance for a holiday in your own country. Not many I bet. My only advice is to make sure you read the small print and if you can afford it, take out travel insurance. Better yet, stay away from Sykes Cottages as will we going forward."
<<Did we take out travel insurance? No we didn't. Had we planned for my husband to be sick then of course we would have. Who takes out travel insurance for a holiday in your own country.>>I have travel insurance and mostly holiday in the uk. Why not? It can be just a s expensive as going abroad. I hope your husband is on the mend
"Many thanks for your reply. You are right, it is just as expensive as a holiday abroad. Expensive lesson learnt."
Really glad I read these reviews. Will not be booking with Sykes. When will companies realise - it's easy to win the argument and lose the customer. Customer Service 101!
"Agree DO NOT BOOK WITH SYKES COTTAGES!! We have just returned from a filthy house, the owner thinks it is fine and seemingly SYKES COTTAGES have no responsibility. Please use another cottage company."
"It seems like nothing has changed with Sykes cottages in 4 years. I've booked a cottage that they advertise as a place to rest and relax, where you can be lulled by the sound of the waves. What they didn't mention is that there is a building site a few feet from the cottage! All you can hear is the noise of hammering, drilling and workmen yelling from 8am! The workmen can also look at you as you sit on the terrace overlooking the sea, really uncomfortable!Sykes had plenty of opportunity to tell me when I called them with queries. They were also useless and couldn't answer most of my queries. The owner told me that Skyes knew about the building site. She also mentioned that there had been complaints about the noise! I would never have booked if Sykes cottages had told me about this. Surely this is basic stuff, they really should not have let it slip."
"Definitely agree. We booked a 4 person cottage with 2 bathrooms. When we arrived there was only 1 bathroom. Of course Sykes had nothing to do with thatAfter submitting our review we received an email intended for the owner saying "" This customers' scoring will not reflect your overall feedback score as we deem this to be a poor reflection based on previous feedback.""Why bother to request feedback if you're going to ignore it?"
"I agree, I always buy holiday insurance for UK as well as abroad."
"When booking through Sykes cottages, you really do need to make sure you have insurance, we made that mistake and my has bund had a massive heart attack just before our holiday two years ago, and they were not very sympathetic towards my plight, however they do have real quality accommodations, just back this year on holiday with my parents and the accommodation could not have been any better, but I did take out insurance this year, just in case."
"I agree whole heartedly. We booked Bolton barn for a week and only stayed one night. Apart from the smell of sewage which the owners said they could not smell, the barn is situated at the end of a single track road with few passing places. As nowhere is near we would have had to use the road twice a day, not my idea of fun. Beware if you want to take a shower, the water is either scalding hot or freezing cold, this is due to the high water temperature and water pressure something any DIY person could have fixed. Reading the guest book is like the ""Emperors new clothes"", maybe they only leave the good ones in.Don't as I did write to the owners, (they were on holiday themselves) to give them a chance to reply as you will be wasting your time. When I did get to speak to Sykes all I got was the owners would not make any refund so that was it. If I drive around the M25 on a Friday afternoon only to spend one night at a cost of about £400-00 then I think I have a genuine reason to complain.I shall never use this company again and would advise anyone thinking about it to lay down in a darkened room until the feeling has passed."
"Sykes cottages is a HOLIDAY DESTROYER!Atrocious company that spoiled my entire holiday plan. I booked a cottage in Wales with them and paid for it. On getting the confirmation, I went ahead buying my travel tickets, etc. Also planned with friends who were in Wales around that week. A day later I got a phone from Matthew (Sykes) telling me that the cottage isn't available because the owner has let it out himself and not told Sykes. Well that isn't my problem! He said he will suggest alternatives but no response. I rang the crooked company after 2 days and Dean (Sykes) tells me that there are no options and the original property has been moved to some other agent and the listing is obsolete - another reason for the mess up contradicting the first one. Ultimately, plans cancelled and embarrassment with friends and angry family.Long story short, this is a messy company and deal with them only if you are determined to make your life hell. STAY AWAY."
"A lot of owners are leaving Sykes, so it might have been that Sykes just hadn't bothered to remove the listing so it looked like they had more properties available.If you are interested in the original cottage, it might be worth tracking it down with some googling and asking the owner if it really is booked. They might not be aware of what's happened and if not booked, you can deal with the owner directly."
"I was due to go to a 12 person cottage, which I booked and paid for through Sykes, next Saturday 5th August 2017. Yesterday, 10 days before our holiday, Natasha or Natalie rang to tell me that the owner had removed the property from their lettings. I now have 2 grandsons, great grandmother, brother and his whole family and my daughter without a holiday!!!! They looked for an alternative but no joy. I have been given all my money back with an extra 10per cent compensation but I have a very upset family with nowhere to go!!! I will be taking this further once I know my options from a solicitor or maybe Watchdog needs a call. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT USE SYKES COTTAGES BASED IN CHESTER!!!!!!!!"
"I don't think that legal action will be a useful path. As you have received compensation, it will be very difficult to show that you have incurred a loss through a breach of contract.As for Watchdog, in my opinion it's waste of time!"
"Avoid booking with Sykes.I recently stayed in a hovel of a cottage they sold me through there website.After numerous emails phones calls etc. they have just decided to ignore me.The property was a disgrace, damp, smelly and not ready for customers.However after telling them they should not rent this to families with young kids stay there, its still for rental on there website.Im taking to social media and will post pics on FB etc. to show the cottage they rented and this is only because they have completely ignored my request for some form of compensationEdited: 3 years ago "
"David, I'm confusd about your motives. If you;re trying to help others avoid a cottage, then you should post the details here, and wriote a review. This will help others. Or are you simply annoyed that they wouldn't give you compensation so you are trying to puncih them with a social media campaign?.I ask this because of your wording at the end of your post. Despite informing them that the cottage should not be rented to families with young children due to the state of it, you now appear to be saying that if you'd received money form them as you requested, you wouldn't have come on social media at all. By implication, that means you'd be happy for others to suffer the same experience as you did.Please could you clarify?"
"David, how much compensation would it take for you to stay silent please?"
Already posted a review on tripadvisor to warn people of the issue of the state of the cottage.And yes clearly im taking to social media to inform people of the poor customer service received from Skyes.
?
Would you have taken to social media if they had paid you compensation?
"We just booked a cottage through homeaway website that then went through to Sykes cottages as the agent of the property. We paid in full as it was close to the time of travel and had an email confirming where to collect the key etc. However a week before the date of travel, we were contacted to let us know that the owners had told them the dates were not available as they had a double booking. No real apology - they offered to look for other properties but couldn't find anything else nearby. They also washed their hands of helping us recover the £106 finders fee we paid to homeaway as they said it's a separate company and we have to let them know ourselves that the booking is cancelled (why would they believe us??). However when I went to find the contact details for homeaway on the email from them, they were actually for Sykes and the email was homeaway@sykes.co.ukThe Sykes customer service reps told me they would not be working with the property owner again and were having lots of problems with homeaway - however I think the main problem is with them, they must not have confirmed the dates with the owner before taking our payment, and seem to be in cahoots with homeaway. If I was a property owner I would be very wary of using them as they would think nothing of blaming them!"
"I booked a weeks holiday with Sykes for a cottage in Salterns 2 at Seaview Isle Of Wight not being a driver the facilities sounded ideal for me, they were not true, The Blue Cafe which was described as having TV lounge with WIFI, bar, and food, was one large room with a counter at one end a few tables and chairs,TV and sofa and closed at 6pm and closed on Sunday, no little shop which one would expect at a self catering holiday camp,Seaview Village was mentioned as a short walk away was told at reception a ten minute drive, after traveling all day was hungry so had to call for taxi to take me into Ryde for a meal then later a taxi back, had interesting talk with driver who said this had happened to other people who left after one night I left after 2 nights to be told by receptionist that others had also cut there holidays short , being in UK did not think it necessary to get insurance as was traveling by trainEdited: 2 years ago "
"September 2017Booked a cottage in North Tawton Devon.On their Website it looked a good property.WRONG>Post holiday,complained in detail to Sykes cottages about the condition of the Cottage, looking for an amendment to the cost.Told they would liase with the ownerOwner took over the cottage with others, very recent so expected a clean and tidy place.It was overall shabby and most main Kitchen appliances were dirty . Some soft furnishes were in poor state of repair.Not pleased with Sykes response, very negative, not prepared to consider they have some responsibilityfor the lettings.Told the only thing for me was to take it up with the owner, not progressed as it would have been their word against mine.Had used Sykes before and was well pleased. But will not use them again."
Be careful when browsing Sykes cottage site.Saw lovely cottage online and confirmed dates of arrival and departure via site calender An approx price came up which was very reasonable. Completed booking info etc and awaited e mail replyWithin 5 mins had reply BUT price was stated as 3 times the stated figure( in the thousands.)I contacted Sykes by phone and was told that the site I was looking at was TRIPADVISOR SYKES COTTAGES.the self same picture and layout.from the conversation with Sykes the booking info requested on my site should have mentioned dates were incompatible plus seasonal differences . but Sykes could not help...So who is at fault Trip Advisor or Sykes.!!!! beware....
"We made very bad experience with SYKES cottages in Cornwall from July 7th to 21st.: The cottage bookedwas humid with strong smell of mould fungus, big brown humid patches, bad air in all the rooms, especially in the living room which we could not use at all. The air of mould fungus produced severe allergic symptoms in one oft us so that he was forced to rent a B + B room in addition. Sykes cottages didn´t help us at all. They made promises they never fulfilled and have not given us any compensation. Very annoying.Klaus frpm Germany"
"In the light of point five below I have decided to add my comments about this firm.Clearly looking at this forum there are a lot of question marks about Sykes Cottages which it would have been helpful to read before I booked with them. I would now wish to advise others to do the same. From my experience1) They seem to have no systems in place for financially penalising owners who withdraw cottages from rental and break their contract with a renter. If you look at reviews of Sykes this appears to be an all too common happening with their set up2) Perhaps most importantly they appear to have no systems in place for IMMEDIATELY notifying a renter when a cottage provider pulls out of a rental agreement. In my case I booked a cottage in April for the following October, found out quite by chance myself in late August that the cottage owner had defaulted and when I spoke to Sykes in September to discuss this they told me that because they were busy they hadn't actually got round to dealing with the ""failed"" October rentals yet!3) Their efforts to help me find an alternative were non existent 4) Having promised they would call me back and didn't on three previous occasions they finally did so at the fourth attempt5) I wrote to their/one of their Directors-a Mr Graham Donohue- about their customer service and suggested they at least refund me their booking charge to compensate me for the cost of phone calls to them, calls to alternative cottage providers, train fare and car hire cancellations etc etc but didn't even receive the courtesy of a replyIn summary they appear to be fine in taking their booking fee if things are straightforward but don't want to know if things go wrong. I certainly wont ever use them again and would preach caution to others who are thinking of doing so."
Be aware and do not take out holiday Insurance through Sykes Cottages; I did to my regret.Having cancelled because of illness after having paid in full to Sykes Insurers they have not paid me any money back and just given me numerous excuses.Sykes have been no help at all and do not seem interested. I have written to the insurers directly and sent all the paperwork requested on three separate occasions. This has been going on since I was admitted to hospital in May 2017 with making numerous phone calls to Towergate Chapman Stevens(the Insurers) having resulted in no action - not even a phone call.My next step is to leave the matter this in the hands of my solicitors.I hope this helps other people to avoid this awful company; people do not cancel holidays without good reason and do not expect to have this added aggravation on top of being unwell !!
"We used sykes cottages to let out 2 properties, they were good at booking them up and very happy to take people's money ,however when it came to paying us after they had taken their 44%, they have done nothing but drag their feet and mess us around, the payment is now over a week late, after over 200 phone calls and lots off empty promises by rude, careless staff, we are still no better off!!! We have pulled our 2 properties from their books and served them papers, they are in court on Monday, hopefully to get their comeuppance and finally pay up what they owe ,avoid dealing with these cowboys at all costs, they don't deserve your money and never ever do what they say they will, absolute nightmare to deal with, I'm very surprised they are one of the more popular companies as with how they swindle the property owners ,it's a wonder they have any properties to let out at all. My advice would be to use cottages.com or another source, just avoid these shysters at all costs. If you have the misfortune of having to deal with them on the phone, make sure you speak to a manager, other wise you will just get passed from pillar to post, however the managers are full of hot air too."
"Dear Nicky.As per our telephone conversation on Tuesday last, I am confirming that our hopes and expectations for Beach House (Ty Traeth) fell far short of our previous many and varied self catering holidays over many years and in various countries.On arrival there was no normal information folder listing rubbish collection day, wifi arrangements, doctors and hospital, bus and train info, pubs and restaurant recommendations etc.I contacted the keyholder for some basic information on rubbish and wifi and was told that a previous customer had taken the information away with them.There were no coat hooks in the hallway for wet or outdoor clothes, these were           later found fixed to the rear of the smaller bedroom.          There were no towel rails in the bathroom, nor a bin for normal non flushable           bathroom waste.  Normal items were missing from the kitchen. Tea pot, coffee pot/caffetiere/coffee   filter. Wastebin. Ovengloves. The amount of crockery was miserly, four of large   and small plates and cereal bowls. The non stick saucepans were excellent , but   the metal kitchen tools were unsuitable and liable to cause damage to the non stick   surfaces. The dishwasher was economically and ecologically not viable because of   lack of crockery etc. One cooker hood light was not working.   The floor throughout had not been mop washed clean. I like to go barefoot as soon   as I arrive indoors. When I went into the wet shower on Sunday morning the shower floor became black from my feet. The kitchen floor did have a thoroughwash on Wednesday evening though when the washing machine poured water over it. We were having our meal and I got up to put the kettle on only to find the kitchen floor flooded. As we were mopping the floor with mop, bucket and towels we couldn’t see where the leak was but then the machine went onto rinse water pump-out, the flap opened and water poured out again. I held the flap closed until the cycle finished and we switched the machine off.On investigation I found that the drain/filter assembly was detached and the force of the water on it pushed the flap open. I refitted the drain/filter securely as per the washing machine manufactures instructions, we then completed the washing and then did another load with   towels etc. It would be a good idea to mention in your description of the property that parking is under cover with limited headroom, so larger higher vehicles or vehicles with aroofrack or roofbox might have a problem, also be careful when opening a vehicle tailgate.I must ask who inspects and reports on your properties before they are acceptedfor marketing by you?Do you have an inventory list for each of your properties?Because our hopes and expectations for Beach House (Ty Traeth) fell so far short of our reasonable expectation I am looking for financial compensation from Sykes Cottages Limited and look forward to your prompt reply.We have never ever before had to send a letter like this to any company or individual that we have rented a holiday home from.Yours sincerely."
I am posting regarding our original post of Beach House (Ty Traeth) Deganwy on 16th October 2017.I am pleased to say that our complaint has been addressed to our complete satisfaction and we would now consider Sykes Cottages again for a self catering holiday.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I have had a really bad experience with Sykes cottages this week. We have been to stay at a cottage where we had issues, we paid a premium because it was said to be luxurious, it wasn't! Bad value for money and Sykes have not done anything to assist in getting some of our money back due to the accommodation filling with smoke from a faulty log burner!! DO NOT USE SYKES COTTAGES!! They haven't even added my formal feedback on the accommodation to their sites!!"
Just a timely warning to all...To Avoid this Company..Sykes Cottages of Chester https://www.sykescottages.co.uk/… the plague...After they have refused to help my Daughter out in any way with regards to any type of refund..After she had to cancel her original booking owing to the birth of our first Grandchild clashing with the booking date...She is now £1000.00 out of pocket ..Just what you need when you are expecting your first Child....A right shower of scumbags..Please feel free to share this with all your friends...It's an absolute disgrace...This company could easily re fill this booking for next year..And will ..So they gain a second booking ..Plus my Daughters £1000.00...Her booking insurance will not cover this either..Needless to say..She was not pregnant when the original booking was made....This is shameful and blatant profiteering...Book with them at your peril...
This Company really are a shameful bunch of profiteering swine....
"I have recently had a negative experience with Sykes Cottages.. i asked for a call back. Didn’t happen. I tried their live chat. Nobody at the other end. I resorted to calling myself. I was interested in accommodation that was coming up as £342 for 3 nights and only £412 for the week. I was looking at Friday to Sunday where their rental week starts on a Friday. I wanted the call taker to put it to the owner that I would be interested but not at 114 per night when for a night if I stayed a week it it was only 58. I suggested £75 a night when asked what I would be prepared to pay. So was expecting it to be put to the owner. The call taker spoke to a supervisor who said the owners would not accept it. My query is, how do you know if you don’t put it to them. Currently on the website the accommodation is not booked at all for the month of February. If I rented my property with you I certainly would want to be given a choice whether to accept it or not. Also people who cannot get a week off are being disadvantaged by double the price rates for a few nights for the same product. I am definitely not recommending Sykes cottages and I would expect if the owner knew that someone was interested and the offer had not been put to them then I would expect t them to be disgruntled and potentially remove their cottage from your site. Poor poor customer service. So basically I can get a very nice hotel including breakfast for the same price. Your loss"
"In counterpoint, I just spent a week in accommodation booked through Sykes, and it all went without a hitch. Clean and pleasant and exactly as described. Seems like the issues seem to crop up often when people want to make changes against Ts and Cs."
">My query is, how do you know if you don’t put it to them. Currently on the website the accommodation is not booked at all for the month of February. If I rented my property with you I certainly would want to be given a choice whether to accept it or not<I rent a cottage through a company that has been taken over by Sykes. All owners are asked what prices they are prepared to accept at the beginning of the season and whether they are prepared to discount for late bookings in busy periods. The reason they will not phone up the owner every time someone wants to haggle is that it causes them admin costs and takes up the owner's time. The ""wriggle room"" for pricing has already been pre-agreed. As to your misunderstanding of pricing - here's how it works - these places all have fixed costs - council tax, water, phone, mortgage, and require some basic heating even when empty; add onto that the cost of cleaning and laundry before and after each guest - that's why a week doesn't cost much more than a weekend in low season - the weekend is the easier bit to sell.As to Eddy's complaint above - read the t's & c's before you book. It's impossible to say whether Sykes can re-let that property for that period but I would guess that it's in the winter months, so that's less likely. In any event, due dates are very inaccurate - baby may have come by then or be a few weeks away."
As an owner we have had totally the opposite experience. Sykes refunded a booking Due to the Booker refusing to stay due to the cottage being dirty. They had requested to arrive early which we agreed to but told them that the cottage may not be ready . When the arrived the cleaner was in the process of preparing the cottage and they refused to let her finish the cleaning. We expressly told Sykes not to make a refund as the complaint was not justified - were totally ignored.They subsequently cancelled another booking without telling us . When we rang the customer to give them arrival details they had been told that it was us who had cancelled. Sykes had refused to offer them alternative accommodation and then tried to charge us the cancellation fee.We are now over £500 out of pocket in addition to the lost bookingsWe have now placed our cottage with TOAD HALL who are like a breath of fresh air compared to the lousy service provided by Sykes. Avoid them both as a customer and an owner
"Sorry I disagree we booked through Sykes cottage April 2017 and stayed at The Hayloft, Brampton in the Lake District. We had a n amazing time, the cottage was furnished to the highest standard and the owners who lived on site were so friendly. It was lambing season and she prepared us that we might here her husband and son getting up in the middle of the night to attend one of their sheep. We met the owner at the beginning and the end of our stay and part from the she didn't come near but was on hand should we need her. She was lovely and will be staying there in the future. Beautiful place and beautiful people."
"Hello there, I am an owner just bulied by them. Any chance to get conceded?"
">Hello there, I am an owner just bulied by them. Any chance to get conceded?<not entirely sure what your post means but if you have a dispute with Sykes Cottages you need a lawyer. This is just a travel advice forum."
Sorry for mistake. I am looking for owners who have a bad experience with Sykes.
"Be warned, Sykes are the worst companyI’ve ever booked through. We booked and paid for our Christmas holiday and about 4 days later they cancelled saying our property should never have been advertised for the whole of December! They then sent me an email of other options and in the options of available properties was the property they had just cancelled!! Useless bunch of idiots, I received the same email 4 times. When my partner said he’d seen one other property but it was more expensive, would they pay the difference as compensation they said no, we will pay 10% but this was more. Ruined our Christmas but that doesn’t matter. I will never use this company again, thanks Clara."
"As a property owner we have used Sykes as our booking agent for almost 4 years. Their staff are hard working , diligent and courteous to us and, as far as we know, our customers. Our booking levels have been excellent , well over 85%. The vast majority of customers have been excellent but there is always the odd ones who leave the place a total tip. We do not expect customers to clean through but to at least put their rubbish in the bins provided, clean the baths of muck and scum after use and put things back where they found them not just discard them where they fall. We pride ourselves in the property being pristine when customers arrive. We always leave home made scones or cakes along with milk, tea , coffee , sugar, washing up liquid, loo rolls, clean towels, liquid soap etc. I cannot understand the negativity towards Sykes in many of your replies. The properties are competitively priced and we pre agree discount limits with them before each new price year. Obviously, people cannot just cancel close to the holiday dates but occasionally a burst pipe , leaking roof or other issues could lead to a late cancellation. We have never had to do this to a customer and would always try to pay a refund if it was our fault and they could not find a suitable alternative. Hope this helps to give a fair assessment of Sykes."
"A fair assessment in your opinion of Sykes cottages as a home owner but not really relevant to the comment I left about being let down by them.The cottage we had booked should never have been advertised yet they sent it in an email to me again and again!!!I don’t see how your comments about cleanliness etc have anything to do with my post.Each time I called I spoke to someone different, even though I asked to speak to one person in particular I could never get through to her.I found them polite but unable to rectify the mistake that had led to our holiday being cancelled."
"Anyone interested in a homeowner and customer view of Sykes Cottages should go to the Facebook page, Sykes cottages appreciation page. Very good to read both sides of the story, they’ve shafted quite a few people."
"Go to the Facebook page, Sykes cottages appreciation page, pretty interesting"
For information: it's called sykes cottages appreciation society
"I am amazed that anyone uses this terrible firm. I wish that I had read all these awful reviews of their so-called service before I booked a cottage on Xmas eve. Within a week we had to abandon the trip for family reasons and the company refused to consider a refund or a credit note! They just didn't care at all, so just like all of the people featured here, we are out of pocket;despite buying their rubbish insurance. No-one should use them under any circumstances."
They are one of the worst firms and couldn't care less about looking after their customers. Don't be wary don't use them!!!
"I've been using Sykes Cottages for several years now and have been satisfied with them on the whole. They're also a bit cheaper than the posher companies such as English Country Cottages. I only had one negative experience, when I rented Hyfield at Antony, Cornwall (see: https:/…2-Hyfield-4555.html ). The place was poorly maintained and cleaned with no welcome pack or log supply on arrival. The owner denied any problems with the property but Sykes refunded me £150 - after a few weeks of negotiation. All the problems were minor so hardly ruined the holiday but too many niggles on the property to justify the relatively high rental charge. I will use Sykes again, indeed I've already booked a property in mid-Wales; I'll post again if there's any problems."
Totally agree we booked a cottage paid the deposit they have no record of the booking even though we have proof they took a payment! They are refusing to refund us even though they didn’t make a booking for us !
"Dear Barnsleygir,Would it be possible to give us a call on 01244 345700 using option 3, then option 2 to discuss this in more detail. Sykes Cottages take feedback like this very seriously. Alternatively you can email us on info@sykescottages.co.ukWe look forward to hearing from you.Kind regards."
"Great until there is a problem to resolve. We arrived to glass and rubble at the property we booked in Deal. Eventually, the owner sent a builder to clear up the mess, but Sykes refused to refund even a token amount. Apparently, because I had cut my toe on the glass (I stupidly took off my shoes), they are not willing to refund as it is ""now a legal issue"" and I should apparently sue. Shoddy. Customer service needs improvement. Not using them again. Plenty of better companies out there."
"Will never recommend sky cottages. Booked a cottage for this weekend. But due to ""Beast from the East"", wanted to cancel the booking. Since 2 days we were discussing about postponing the dates. But none of the staff told us about the extra money we have to pay for the difference. Today they informed me that I have to pay the difference as the cost of the cottage on that particular date is 500. This should be very clearly stated when we first asked them about the cancellation procedure. Dont know why sky cottages have problem in refunding the money. I have checked other website, it clearly stated: You may also receive a full refund from the owner if you cannot reach your destination due to snow or flood conditions or as a result of being involved in an accident while on the way there (This only applies if you have made every effort to try and complete your journey. You will need to produce evidence to us from the police or Highways Agency). They should at least refund some amount of money. Why would I pay extra 200, rebook everything again.During the conversations, some staff was nice, but some were rude..I should have checked the reviews first.. my big mistake.."
"Swarna, this is a thread about Sykes cottages not Sky (whoever they are). Have you tried claiming on your travel insurance?"
I agree not to use this hem I dad problems due to very adverse weather conditions and asked to cancel my booking As yet no refund I paid £297 Nit a good company if you need to change your arrangemmet
"yes, my mistake, sorry. I was so frustrated.. it is Sykes cottages not sky. No I don't have travel insurance. BTW the travel insurance doesn't cover adverse weather conditions.There should be at-least half money back."
I add to this litany of dissatisfaction - tried to book a Giggleswick property they manage - on tripadvisor and on there own site listed at 320 pounds pw - wanted 10 days - they reply with a quote of 746 pounds!! - I query this with 2 e-mails over 4 days - they are supposed to be on line 7 days a week - no reply from them - only saving grace is this then made search and found this forum so have now booked elsewhere - thank goodness I did not pay it
Do not book with Sykes ....We are staying in a cottage booked with Sykes in Braidley near Leyburn North Yorkshire. Over Easter the outside temperature dropped below zero. The heating is on a timer and doesn’t come on until 6pm. This meant the cottage was nearly uninhabitable during the day. We contacted the owner who said he was not going to change the timer so we complained to Sykes who said that this was down to the owner to sort out. The house is damp and cold with mold in most of the rooms. The radiator in one of the rooms does not work. We have been shocked by the lack of concern from both the owner and Sykes. The cottage is also very poorly equipped with not even the basics of bin bags or washing up liquid provided. For £850 a week we expected much better. If Sykes were a responsible rental company there would have taken action to resolve. They have done nothing and are now ignoring emails.
"I sympathise. The only thing is that if you book via any rental company, it seems to me that if you are prepared to put in the work, you could get some re-imbursement? For example, was the property graded and did not meet the grade, or was it described as being heated? We just booked a ""luxury"" cottage but unfortunately, it was direct with the owner and although we have written a letter I don't suppose we will get very far. (we had the same problem - freezing cold, damp bed, all the storage heaters turned off at the wall.)I really think it is about time somebody made rules about these properties and the buyers rights. Increasingly, we are finding total money-grabbing on the part of owners who want as much out of you as they can get away with. It is about time we made official complaints whenever this kind of thing happens or it will just become the norm and get worse and worse."
This thread has been going since 2013 and people are still booking with Sykes ?????
"Oh dear where do I start? Cart lodge booked through Sykes cottages for Easter 2018 was the worst ace I've ever stayed and apparently they are supposed to have looked at it, well the description was luxury, beautiful furnishings, decorated to a standard of excellence, vibrant decor so far from the truth you couldn't get I could have got second hand furniture from a charity shop which was more beautiful and definitely more comfortable than that, not only was it not a true description when I got there I had to clean it myself, we didn't even empty the suitcases as we wouldn't put our clothes in the drawers, got in touch with Sykes cottages and they refuse to acknowledge any responsibility even though it was because of their false advertising I booked it in the first place. Why can't we leave a review on their website I wonder."
"That's because you can't leave a review on their website and I for 1 didn't check any other review sites I'm sorry to say as I had a bad experience with as well,"
"Same with me, I stayed in cart lodge over Easter 2018 the description was so far from the truth, I only booked it because of the description they provided and now they are taking no responsibility at all, why can't we leave a review on their website I wonder."
"Some people are luckier than you then. I am a cottage owner and even though I tried to add my owner booking to their Calendar, without any success, either online or by phone, they then double booked for me. When I contacted them about this and told them their website was giving me error messages and I couldn't add a booking, nor could I get through by phone as they were deemed to be very busy at the time and to try later. Well, later, I simply forgot about it as I was very busy too. However, they would not accept any responsibility and penalised me with the following charges. I must say, the customer did ok and with what they deducted from me, I could have had a holiday myself.ENRefund of charges - Customer Compensation£78.60ENCustomer Compensation - Rent-£78.60ENSales Tax - Owner Cancellation Booking Charge-£15.00ENOwner Cancellation Booking Charge-£75.00ENSales Tax - Booking Fee£1.50ENBooking Fee£7.50ENSales Tax - Booking Fee-£16.33ENBooking Fee-£81.67ENSales Tax - Commission-£31.44 ENCommission-£157.20TOTAL CHARGES TO ME £367.64Does anyone think that this is fair or right ????"
"Does anyone from Sykes cottages ever read these reviews? I'm in a battle at the moment to get some money back but they refuse to acknowledge any responsibility, where on any website can we be heard?"
"Graham Donoghue is the chief executive , He's at grahamdonoghue@gmail.com as far as I know."
"Thank You, have you had any dealings with him?"
"I sent him an email, but he didn't respond."

"Ok thanks, I don't know how he's been getting away with it all these years, anymore sites we can write On?"
"i am due to go away with 9 members of my family to Scarborough for my 50th birthday, i believe i booked a certain house to stay in because of the proximity to the beach and the number of bathrooms and a hot tub, only to find once i had the confirmation i am staying somewhere completely different, i have tried to speak to someone and they insist that i have always been booking this particular property, they didn't reply to my email and i have no other proof that i was booking a different property, i can only think i was re-directed. Then since i complained i am now getting reminders that i can complete my booking at this other property and i have now had another email saying its been reduced, the person i spoke to said i had never been booked on queens cliff yet i am having regular reminders that i am interested and can complete my booking. i am hoping that we have a lovely time as the house we are NOW staying in looks lovely but i will be very reluctant to book through Sykes cottages again, i feel like i have been duped."
Duped? They are a disgrace to the accommodation industry IMHO
I too am disappointed with Sykes following a dispute with an owner. Sykes is washing their hands of it. Sad to know they are not there for you when you need backup. Well I guess there are other letting agencies out there.
There seems to be more and more negative reviews now on this site we should all make a stand and demand Sykes cottages put a review section on it's website as i like many read trip adviser to late
"Horrible, horrible company. Do NOT use them - they are dishonest, greedy and their customer service is non-existent. I had a disagreement with an owner and they weren’t even prepared to listen. There are plenty of other cottage rental companies out there and I will NEVER use these crooks again. Beware."
"Well said but I wonder if people are reading this site, are you still persueing it?"
"We recently booked with Sykes for a family holiday with our three children and we will NEVER book with them again. Firstly - customer service was appalling and secondly they have BULLIED us for money on our return. Bad customer service - the week before our trip I rang to ask the full address of the cottage - to be rudely told they could not tell me as I was not my husband - I had the booking number and I was calling from the number registered on the booking etc and it was not the supposedly friendly holiday rentals agent chat I had expected for such a simple request. BUT the main reason we will never book with them again is because upon our return we received a call - again they would not speak to me - then another call, and another. My husband rang them to be told we had left the cottage in a “state” and they demanded we pay them £150. We where in total shock and asked what had happened worried we had broke something without knowing? We where told the cleaner took six hours to clean the large property and had to dry clean cushion covers?!?! Before leaving the cottage we stripped the beds, placed all towels in the washing machine, emptied the dish washer, the fridge, wiped sides down, all rubbish was left outside - however we thought cleaning a property of that size when people are paying nearly a -£1k per week to stay 6 hrs cleaning time didn’t seem unreasonable and surely cleaning the cushion covers is just part and parcel of looking after a holiday let property) And in retrospect when we arrived the property was acceptably clean however the living area and dining room seemed well used in terms of decor/ soft furnishings - which we just presumed was down to why they let to family’s in the first place! They have tainted the whole holiday and not once have we been made to feel like our enjoyment of the property was important but how much money they can make from the property. I say stay well clear of them."
"Kimmy, ask them for photographic proof, dated on the day you left and refuse to pay anything until they can prove what they say. Most rentals will either charge a cleaning fee, or have it included in the nightly, or weekly rate and I would expect a cleaner to spend 6 hours cleaning a large house if it’s done to a good standard anyway. Regular cleaning of items like cushion covers should be the owners responsibility, as well as general maintenance and upkeep and unless items are damaged, or the place was left really filthy ( which it doesn’t seem to have been) they shouldn’t be harassing you for extra money.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I too have recently had the misfortune to use a Sykes cottage. The complaints about the cottage were swiftly forgotten on trying to complain to Sykes. Their customer service is the worst ever. You never get to speak to anyone, and if you can, they will swiftly fob you off taking no responsibility at all. They also only ever publish good feedback refusing to publish bad feedback thus giving false impressions of the Cottages they let.ALL I CAN SAY IS NEVER EVER USE SYKES COTTAGES!"
"I too booked a cottage in Scotland for my sister in law, her husband and 3 children, and several months in advance. Less than a week before the trip Sykes Cottages left a voicemail message telling me the cottage was no longer available and apologised. No offer of support or replacement. I called to ask for help but they were implacable... 'it is not our fault', 'nothing available', 'no obligation'... Appalling customer service. Would never use them again, and make sure others who are booking cottages are aware of my experience."
In my opinion using one of the websites where you book with owners direct is far better and quite often better deals.
"BEWARE don't book through Sykes or Helpful Holidays . I too have been burnt . I rented a shabby 2 bed house in St Ives ( called the Dolphins) . It was grubby , but did not complain. Now they are keeping the £100 bond for what I took to be general wear and tear and therefore did not record that it was the same when I arrived as when I left. Sykes terms say I must take it up with the owner . Sykes wont give me the owners contact details."
Comments please Sykes ???
"I would just like to say that we have just come back from a very enjoyable holiday in Cornwall staying at a Sykes cottage. We stayed at Daisy Cottage, Rose near Perranporth . We could not fault the cottage in any way what's so ever. The owners Richard and Sue have put a great deal of thought into how the cottage and garden appear. there is a wonderfully stocked garden playhouse for the children that has more toys than they could play with. The whole cottage was very comfortable and we didn't want for anything. We would certainly keep this cottage on file as we will definitely be going back. Many thanks to both Sykes Cottages and to Richard and Sue for the use of a great holiday cottage. Lin Sherman from Southampton."
"I would like to say we have just returned from a lovely holiday at Daisy Cottage, Rose near Perrenporth in Cornwall. We have used Sykes cottages before and can honestly say we have not had a bad cottage yet. This holiday was no different. The owners, Richard and Sue, have gone out of their way to make sure people have a holiday to remember. They have a well stocked cottage - you don't want for anything. Even the children are catered for with a very stocked playhouse in the garden. We took our grandchildren with us and they thought they were in heaven with all the toys. I would like to thank both Sykes cottages and Richard and Sue for ensuring that we had a holiday to remember. Lin Sherman - Southampton."
We just booked with Sykes Cottages and the cottage was not as advertised on their site. It was located at a remote location only accessible by unsealed roads that had steep incline with sharp right hand turn with no signage to stop your vehicle from going over edge of steep hill. The route was dangerous for a small car. The remoteness of the location was not advised. The owner requested to meet us in town to show us the way as he stated that other guests had got lost or got bogged (stuck in the unsealed roads) or have gone over the edge of the hill!! We followed and got stuck. We had hired a car and so couldn’t stay at cottage due to chance of damaging car. Sykes and Owner refused refund saying they are not responsible for how the accommodations is advertised and had a too bad attitude. My husband and I felt really duped and let down by Sykes and the owner.
"Haldenk, unless you tell us which cottage it was your post doesn’t really help anyone. Did you write a review please?"
"Glad someone is sticking up for Sykes. (Will E from Manchester) There must be as many or more Good reviews as bad ones, but the good ones don't seem to be shown, or not posted, as with a good results people are not feeling as 'Indignant' as a bad one , therefore, no need to shout about it, which is a shame, as good reviews need shouting about just as much. I would take half of these complaints with a pinch of salt, as when there is one genuine fault, the complainer usually has a good look round to invent a lot more and in most cases it's about Neuroticism. ."
"We are seasoned holiday home renters, but not usually with Sykes.We booked a week before Xmas family get together but within a matter of THREE hours had to cancel. We lost our deposit of £200 and were told very rudely that we wouldn't find another rental at this late stage!We argued that it was a matter of hours but they still took the money.They do not seem very helpful or flexible and they have lost our custom, never again!This will prove to be to their detriment as there are many holiday let companies to choose from."
Welcome to Sykes the worst holiday company in the U.K.
The original post was 5 years ago and people are still getting sucked in.
Why are you posting this again? It’s clearly an old post
"I booked a holiday through booking.com not realizing Sykes had anything to do with the booking. I accidently entered the wrong dates on the booking.com site. When i realized my error i immediately put in for a refund request on the booking.com site. I never heard back from Sykes. I waited then repeated the procedure a few days later but yet again no reply. I then contacted booking.com with them finally sending me an email saying i cannot get a refund. I then called Sykes and spoke to them, they said they had not even received any requests for me to get a refund?..which i think is lies...although they had tried to call my house since the first request over 30 times but never left a message on my answerphone. I did ask what the calls were about but never got an answer. The lady i spoke to asked me to siphon through my emails to prove i had made the requests and to email her them??I told her it was all ridiculous and i will be issuing them a small claims court request. Its for £208 and booked in a rush because booking.com are constantly saying on their site in bold red ""1 place left etc."". As a single parent i thought i was getting a good deal and i will try a get my money back by any means neccessary. Sykes have never replied to any further emails i have sent them. They are nothing but absurd theives now putting me through all this as if i have not got enough on my plate!"
"Actually, they don't always take the owners side. I'm an owner and I had guests who ruined my property. they did nothing and didn't hold the people who did the damage accountable. I thought I had a security deposit arrangement but I didn't and they didn't tell me. so, no, they don't always take the owner's side. It cost me a lot of money to repair the damage."

"If you have complaints after a Sykes letting you are up against a Wonga Organisation. It does not belong to any trade body, like Holiday Home Association, nor external Arbitrator so you are told to go to court. I’m sure the vast majority of owners are caring with desirable properties. But if not...Having health issues in our early 80ies we saw advert for ‘top of the range’ house by Norwich Marina and just booked a summer week. Only when full payment automatically due did we look closely and see a credit charge of over 3% taken on deposit with bill saying further credit charge to come. We pointed out that the latter was illegal since Jan. 2018 and that was withdrawn. We then saw that another bond of £100 was required straight into Owners bank account with no procedure for return if complaint. We offered £100 by credit card or by cheque returned at end of stay if checking was OK.Sykes wouldn’t allow contact with owners till just before the letting in our case 5 days, when we were given stipulation to take off shoes at the door and not remove the dog blanket on one settee etc. If we had this stipulated with the publicity we doubted we’d have booked and were ready to withdraw. Bond was then said not to be required but we could be charged for any damage. We were misled that one bed was Orthpaedic,–we had asked as one of us has back trouble -, when in fact it was Brighton mattress labelled soft and comfortable with auction label on it. We managed with a bed board. Having asked the owner to meet us at the property, then Sky TV didn’t work and oven was said to be ‘erratic’ and proved to be not useable. We were spoken to in telling off tone. As the Dishwasher needed repair we agreed to owner entering premises to supervise repair. The owner took the liberty to move chair and cushions that we had placed for upright posture best for bad back, with message telling us off for moving cushions from low Settee . This intrusion broke Sykes Owner-Customer Contract (14.1.3) ‘ensure that ...your Guests have exclusive access to the Property and Rental Services for the full period of the Holiday Period’. On leaving owner did not appear and we were not at all surprised that a claim was made, for a burn mark – of which we were unaware - claiming evidence that still after 6 weeks was not forthcoming after we challenged. Not a pleasant holiday house stay. Sykes took 16 days initially to respond to our complaints. We processed this then though our credit card company, and as it was about quality then onto Trading Standards via Citizens Advice(CAB) who said to ask Sykes for arbitration procedure, to which there was no response other than ‘go to court’, which seemed their standard practice. CAB also enlightened us that company like Sykes was set up as an agent with no responsibility if anything goes wrong as they can claim they only do what Owners say, so small claims court procedure is only to Owners, who themselves come a lowly second to Venture Capitalist Investors. Quite a learning exercise. And strange that Sykes gets top British Travel Award year after year? It comes about not by independent body, like ABTA, but by some holiday companies drumming up votes for themselves, which Sykes seems good at, and giving themselves awards at an Annual Dinner."
"I gave up trying to even find a suitable holiday cottage on Sykes website. It was imperative for us that the property had dedicated parking so I added 'parking' to their filters. Parking, apparently also includes local carparks according to Sykes, hence every property in the UK has 'parking'. I contacted them about this rubbish and got a load of non sense in response . It was fortunate that they gave the reply they did as this told me everything I needed to know about the company and their attitude to customers. They clearly like to 'trick' the public into booking just anything, as it took very careful reading sometimes to establish that the 'parking' was actually non-existent. I cannot understand why the property owners put up with this, if they are genuinely offering a valuable asset like parking, you would think they would want their property highlighting. Do not book through Sykes, you never know what else they are hiding."
"I am a property owner with Sykes and we have a whopping private car park, also excellent reviews at https://kentsfarmcottages.co.uk/reviews/ . We shouldn't all be tarred with the same brush."
"You were lucky If the property is fine and the customer is happy, then there is no problem in booking a Sykes Cottage. It is when something goes wrong that Sykes completely fail to act - and it seems they are unwilling to support either the people booking the cottage or the cottage owners."
"Hi Sandra C of Louth. Please read my post again. I was pointing out that Sykes as a booking agent is not doing you property owners, who do have legitimate parking, any justice by deliberately making it impossible to identify this on their site. If I were to let any of my properties out on holiday lets, I would not be happy about this, and I would blame Sykes and not the prospective customers who comment on it."
"RJFIMF Bristol Not so in my case, unless something has changed recently. Sykes are always on top of things and get it sorted without delay."
"I have found that, when a customer asks a question about my property, Sykes always ring me to ask that question and find out. They have rung on several occasions to clarify something or other for the customer."
"Booked this holiday through booking.com and Sykes cottages holidays, we booked a week at west bay club for our honeymoon... upon booking confirmation I rang Sykes AND west bay to ask if they could arrange some flowers or wine for my wife for our arrival (to my cost not theirs), yes mr Garner, no problem they both said, upon arrival there were no flowers or wine, not even a part toilet roll, so I drove the two miles to the nearest shop before unpacking. We both got showered and dressed after our long journey, to visit the advertised restaurant on site... no such place exists ( still advertised today on booking.com ), there was a ‘bistro’, that sold just drinks, so another drive out to eat. The accommodation looked nothing like the brochure pictures, there was not a lot of room at all, similar room to a caravan in fact. The curtains had mouldy circles blending in with the coloured stripes. The bed had long black hairs in, the bed wasn’t long enough for a six foot tall adult, the layer of dust on headboard was god knows how old. The tv was too dark to watch, and the sofa ok for two kids! My partner who is really easy going said (rightly) to leave it and make the best of it, but half way through the week when a workman NEXT DOOR started drilling and banging at 7 AM, this went on for nearly an hour and a half and only stopped after I begged him too, hour later he started again, I rang reception and they said an owner was having a boiler fitted and basically tough, owners come first, so I rang Sykes, the lady said she couldn’t hear me over the drilling, I asked if they could have pre warned us? Nothing back. The day before my car wheel sank into one of the deeper pot holes and punctured a tyre. so I spent an hour changing the wheel. After almost being reduced to tears I had had enough, we both had, we rand west bay and Sykes and complained, after a lot of emailing we were offered 20% refund and tyre cost refunded, we agreed to accept and draw a line under it after being promised the holiday would be better after all this.  We got back to the chalet, after telling the lady (who asked) they were welcome to go into the flat, thought they were gonna put some flowers in, nothing, well not nothing, we had a broken fridge, the under plate had collapsed some how and contents were ruined and spilt, rang reception and they sent... drum roll.... the manager of the Fitness club!! Who informed of no maintenance available ( on a development that big? ), rang to check boiler man had finished and we wouldn’t be awoken again and we were informed we wouldn’t be awoken again, guess what, next morning he was back!!! Having spoke to a few people on the island, the west bay has a reputation for being really poor unless you are an owner, totally seems like it. There were a lot of bigger, nicer and hopefully cleaner places empty on that site, we were packed in like sardines. We rang Sykes holidays when back saying we didn’t want to accept the still unpaid %20 and were informed we would have to go to the small claims court. We don’t have the time or money to do that, but we will make it clear on every review site we can.Thanks to Sykes cottages and the West bay club for doing your best to ruin what was supposed to be the most special week of my life. ...... wait for the automated response about listening to customers comments, there are reviews from two years ago that haven’t been listened too.Isle of Wight was beautiful, good job really as we spent as much time out as we could."
"My partner was checking out some holiday cottages and flats for a short Devon or Cornwall holiday after we have been operating a busy season with our holiday flats in Wales. She was asking on my behalf a question regarding access and parking for our car. She used Sykes' website to type in the question but came there back a vague reply so she phoned to be told that if she booked that flat she would also be billed an extra sum because she had used their contact to ask the initial question!!!! Incredulous she told me. Not surprising then that we decided to look elsewhere and with a different agent and in fact the agent we use at home AND then found we got an ""owners discount"" from them! A loss to Sykes and to their Devon owner!Well timed as my daughter is about to select an agent to help her market her newly purchased flat also in Wales and Sykes were on her short list!I have joked that it was ""our effort at mystery shopping and we wouldn't want our customers to be ripped off""! It is indeed a funny old world!"
"SYKES COTTAGES - without doubt by far the worst holiday lettings agency in the UK (based on one recent booking with them and our experiences over many years with other far more reputable agencies).Our main criticism is that their property descriptions (certainly ours - ""Chalky Downs, Kingsgate"") was inaccurate to the point of deception and that, further, any reviews left, no matter how justified and balanced, are completely ignored and certainly not published on their website if they in any way can be viewed as critical. In some cases, probably in consequence, there are very few reviews actually published - and what are, usually very positive, may be reasonably viewed with some suspicion.This company seems only concerned with grabbing their booking fees and selling insurance. Despite some of their advertising hype suggesting an emphasis on quality, their concerns seem only for themselves and the owners who use them. Thank goodness for REAL review sites such as Trip Advisor. Would avoid SYKES - and Chalky Downs, Kingsgate (see review on this website) - at all costs. There are plenty of alternative reputable holiday lettings agencies (and holiday homes) to choose from!"
What an awful company! And are some of these owners aware that not everybody can walk without shoes on their feet?
There's a discount for booking on the internet. They will waive the call centre price if you ask.
Sykes have a filter for off road parking so you should be able to check before you book. The owner has final sign off for the description so they are responsible for the accuracy.
"Hi Good Time Charlie Boy, yes they have a filter for off road parking, but as my original post said, it includes local carparks and road side parking!!! By this criteria every property in the UK has 'parking'. How does this help customers looking to filter only those properties with genuine safe parking for their car? If, as you say, the property owners are really responsible and actively encouraging/involved in this, I think this is evidence of them not being trustworthy. Quite how the legitimate owners feel about this duplicity, having to share the limelight with owners who are not actually offering parking sounds like generosity in the extreme."
"Originally booked Hadrian's Lodge - Brampton, for two weeks.Sensor light broken on arrival. Table lamp exploded.Short circuits in living-kitchen area.Bath-shower rail not screwed into tiles (fell into bath).Electric shower functioned with what seemed an assistance cord, no one knew how it worked. This could have been signalled. Result: poor showers all week with an alternative spray which was sustained by a hairband.The hoover was filled with small stones - had not been emptied previously.No proper towel rail.Cottage could do with a complete refresh.Requested refund for the second week as we no longer wanted to stay. Eventually a part refund was established.Insisting that I should receive the full amount, the company retracted the refund and accused us of damages to the property and closed the issue.Result: My holiday was ruined. My reputation also and I lost my money.Would not recommend to anyone Sykes and Hadrian's lodge. An appalling experience.Edited: 1 year ago "
Hi itgirl2018. How do you know it includes on road parking? I've stayed in many Sykes cottages and never had a problem. Do cottages with on road parking come up in the list after you filter for off road? Never noticed this and would suggest its a system error rather than a deliberate act by Sykes or the owner. BTW Were coming to Lincoln in January - can you recommend any nice restaurants within walking distance of the cathedral?
"Never posted here before but I did a TA review for a Sykes property, Rainbow's End at Maenporth in Cornwall, a few months back because I felt so strongly about it.I did originally post the same review to Sykes own website but now it's mysteriously disappeared. The few good ones are still there but not mine.Not a company I'll be using in future."

we booked a cottage in Scotland it did not state how many bedrooms it had at the time and as we were taking our grand kids with us for a holiday we obviously need 2 bedrooms which the cottage only has 1 after we asked Sykes how many it had i then asked if we could cancel it as it would be of no use (1) room the time lapsed between booking and asking to cancel was 2 weeks bare in mind we were not going till end of may next year i think they are a total rip off they say the money £275.00 deposit would not be refunded as it would be given to the owner ( which i doubt) or not all of it anyways i have emailed them to get things sorted they are totally blanking me not replying at all the good thing is that i have found the cottage on line and will be finding the number out of the cottage myself to speak to the owners ( good thing google is ) if owners want people to stop at their cottages they should have some leeway on genuine people who for some good reason have to cancel ......... and yes no doubt i will get owners coming on here having a go but i think 7 months before we were supposed to go is long enough to let them know that because of them (Sykes) not stating how many bedrooms it has we have to cancel giving the owners plenty of time to re let it out at some point
You quickly get the measure of a company when you see how they respond to a problem or honest mistake.I hope your issue is resolved but Sykes strike me as the sort of company who really couldn't care less.I certainly wouldn't use them again.
"I would also be wary. We stayed in a Sykes cottage the other week, which was not as described and in some areas unsafe. Sykes refuses to publish my fair and factual negative review. I won't be using them again."
"Ridiculuous rip off booking fee! booking a fortnight with sykes cost you around 100pounds booking fee! This is not shown until you move on to actually booking a cottage where this amount is shown. And they already get 25% of the cottage price from the owner! Pure rip off letting people pay 100pounds just to make an online booking! We changed to another agent, but we wanted to let everone know this!!"
"Sept 2018 I stayed in Maple Cottage, Keswick which was rented through Sykes.On arrival it was clear that we had been mis-sold the property as, what was advertised as our own private courtyard patio from which to take in the magnificent views of the Lakeland vista was actually a courtyard with 4 walls and no view.On going to bed I was disturbed to see stains (with appearance of faeces) on 2 of the bed sheets. I didn't report it at the time as we were tired and we had more beds than people.There was also mould on some of the windows, the shower tray did not empty sufficiently well and the lounge carpet stank of dog.On return home I wrote an official complaint, including photographic evidence, and was merely thanked for my feedback.It seems that Sykes do not care about basic hygiene, customer satisfaction, nor their reputation.Will definitely give them a swerve in the future."
"I have also been given the run around by Sykes Cottages. Took my deposit, failed to book the accommodation and tried to sell me a more expensive one. Took numerous phone calls and emails to them to get my money back. Constantly held on the phone and chasing them, no customer service. Didn’t seem to care. Avoid."
Gina: I am sorry for your disappointment but this thread has been running for years now. It's a pity you didn't do more research before you booked.
"Currently going through dispute with Sykes Cottages regarding a property being unsafe, dirty and not as described. I found this out by visiting the property before start date of holiday.Sykes keep referring to the fact they will speak with the landlord of the property regarding cancellation. Quite unbelievable they can continue to advertise a property which is in such a state . You seem to get more questions than answers from them. Fortunately I thought to take some pictures and provided them. Unbelievably still getting numerous emails stating I am liable for the cancellation cost which is extortionate.I wont let them railroad me and will continue to stand my ground as they are presently using bullying tactics plus attempting to take payment from my bank account.Beware before booking with Sykes!!!!"
"Booked an annual family gathering with Sykes, as done on previous years. Due to family split have had to cancel the booking. As I paid the minimum deposit and insurance taken out doesn't cover it, I have to pay the full deposit of £450. I am happy to pay that but they wish to take the money out of my current account, even though I told them there was not enough money to cover this. They said call back and cancel when there is money in the account - to which I explained once my pension had gone in to my accountI would then have no money for rent and food the following month if I did that. I asked if I could give them card details of a credit card to take the money out of but they couldn't accept that, they have to take the money from the account that paid the initial deposit! I asked for their finance department details to see if I could change the card details - no I can't do that. No sympathy, no help. I was even asked to transfer money in to my account, explained I don't have money to do that, still no help. I WON'T BE BOOKING WITH SYKES AGAIN, THAT@S FOR SURE."
"We paid a deposit (at the time of booking), now really need to cancel with five months to go until the break, and have been told we need to pay £711 to cancel!Will never use this awful company again. When replying to us they simply said, ""given that this is the amount of cancellation fee...would you now like to proceed with cancellation?"" as if we were cancelling because we wanted to. Disgusting. And nowhere in their literature or booking information do they specify a percentage of money to be paid as a cancellation fee...they just use vague language such as ""charges...other fees"". That isn't legal - and I have it on good advice."
This is information for anyone who lives near to a Sykes cottage or is thinking of letting their own property through Sykes. People staying at a property we own close to a Sykes cottage were given a dreadful time by riotous and unruly behaviour and foul language during the night by a gang of youths staying as Sykes guests while a Sykes owner nearby had her cottage trashed when a fight broke out between two Sykes guests. Two complaints to Sykes CEO received not an even an acknowledgment. It is worth noting that Sykes do not appear to belong to any professional representative organisation.
I can't but fully agreed!
"I really wish I had read the reviews before I made a two hour car journey down to Cornwall to discover a dirty cottage which had not had a handover clean in time for my arrival. I was so disappointed and being as it was approaching five in the afternoon and I had a seven month puppy in the car all I wanted to do was cry and return home. The condition of the cottage would've required more than a quick tidy up - it needed a deep clean with engrained dirt in the stair carpet, the flooring and up the walls. The next day lunchtime I received a voicemail from Sykes whom I had called to say I was unable to stay in the accommodation the night before as booked to say they had investigated and established no clean had been done because of a mix up of dates by the cleaner and they had left a bottle of wine in the cottage as an apology! They have offered me a paltry £50 refund leaving me £239 out of pocket without travel mileage, my time and distress. I am now going through small claims court."
Do not book with Sykes cottages. They double booked my Easter holiday and cancelled 4 days before we were due to travel. We had paid in full and had all the confirmations. Very disappointed.
Stayed at Moss Cottage in Windermere. Worst break ever! The cottage was not clean. No hot water at all. Bedding and bathroom were so dirty. We asked for a refund and was told no!! The company accused us of damages to the property and closed the issue. Like they have done with many people on here. We never damaged anything at all! This company is full of lies. Now going to WATCHDOG.
I hope you will succeed. Good luck.They deserve a lesson.
"Hi Everybody, DO NOT USE SYKES COTTAGES we booked over the phone from Killarney Co. Kerry for a property in Killorglin which is the next village up from us in Killarney. Our home has builders in for two weeks so we wanted that and when we phoned them they said it’s gone? Not on website it said free but they hard sold us a place in Co. Cork, the lady on the phone was called Shelia and so we booked with debit card there and then for two weeks.she promised very close to Killarney 17 miles. Shops and bars walking distance.However we checked the distance rang taxi companies and it cost €60 to there from here and it’s well past 17 miles very hard to find and no amenities near by.So we tried to cancel same day with CARL the HANDLER OF THE CASE THE CUSTOMERS RELATIONS TEAM! However it continued and we were calling fromIreland to Uk so our phone credit went 3 times €90 emailed then and was promised call backs however this never occurred and we gave two different numbers and they said they were engaged constantly. That also was a lie. So we were told no refund the owner didn’t want to. So we said we will go otherwise it’s wasted then we were given on an email the owners number. A Mr. Dennehy ( PH: 0035387 255 0932 or 003536371764 or 06371764 )in Carragenes, Ballydesmond and he said he understood as it’s happened many times before. He gave a Australian couple their money back and SYKES COTTAGES still charged him the owner the full amount??? Well what’s that say he gives them business and they take all the money??? He admitted it could we be a SCAM! We inquired why he did business with people like that as they should be out of business and he said well maybe they should!!!!We have gone to the bank and they will investigate it all.We haven’t gone and we want others to know what there about.Be very wary they are scamers.Take care x"
Be very wary of them. They recently helped to ruin a holiday I had with my mother who has cancer. They took the owner’s side (she was appalling) and ensured that our trip was effectively ruined. I left a long review on trip advisor explaining exactly what had happened so that other people don’t get duped by this unpleasant owner and Sykes and they’ve removed the listing so that my review is also removed. They did NOTHING to assist and made us feel like we had been swindled out of nearly £500 to stay on a farm at 1 pines cottage Tadcaster North Yorkshire where the owner treated us like a dose of foot and mouth. Ghastly experience all round.
Just got back off a Sykes holidays. A very fun down and not pleasant cottage. Phoned Sykes didn't really what to know. I would never recommended Sykes to anyone
"You can't really blame Sykes for the condition of the property. I have two cottages with Sykes and though I say it myself, they are both excellently kept, 5 stars for everything, loads of parking space, all mod cons and everything you could possibly need and our reviews prove that. Our only failing is the Wi-fi, which again has nothing to do with Sykes and nothing to do with us, that problem is down to BT, who promised everyone Superfast Broadband, yet fail to provide it to many communities. Also, as an owner and knowing the top class condition my properties are in for the holidaymaker to arrive, I am often appalled at the condition that they are in when the holidaymaker leaves. Some of them must live in pig styes !!! The saying is ""you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time."""
"You may not be able to blame Sykes for the condition of the property, but you can blame them for not providing a proper complaints procedure; for shirking all responsibility; for not providing the service to the end user which that user is paying Sykes for."
"They make out they are all customer service when they aren't. They couldn't give a damn about their customers. Its pay up and shut up. Even if your travelling companion dies, they will show you no mercy. Again, pay up and shut up. What way could a company treat you worse than that?"
I hope you succeed too. I'm sure if you dropped dead this company would still want their money
They treat owners the same.
"Do not book though this company , booked a cottage in jan for August , they have just called to say the house has been sold and they need to cancel the booking , terrible service and we now can not find anywhere for the bank holiday"
Believe me you have had a lucky escape financially....
We have a vacancy for August Bank Holiday https://kentsfarmcottages.co.uk
"thanks for that, unfortunately where we had booked , 5 other families are also staying in the same village but I will bear your property in mind"
"Yes,We have booked a week in Loswithiel for August/sept 1 week.Have been to look at the property which is situated up a very steep road. Totally unsuitable for my partner who requires to use a wheelchair.Informed them of this, but the owner of the property will not let us cancel.My partner is 75. Has COPD. She nearly died last November.I have warned them that if anything happens to her I will sue."
"If they said in the contract that there was flat access and the property was suitable for a wheelchair user, I think you have a good case and should maybe take them to the small claims court"
"Do not use Sykes Cottages. Their customer service is terrible. I tried to cancel my holiday on the day on which the balance was due. I was prepared to lose the £600 deposit but was told that I was 12 hours too late and the full amount of £1900 was to be paid...and had already been taken. Yes, I did not fully appreciate the cancellation terms. But at no point were they prepared to offer any discretion.I am a multi-returning customer. They could have easily re-let this high season fortnight and made more money. But the computer said no.I will not be using this company again."
"Booked a cottage back in July 2018 to attend a family wedding in 2020. 11 months later I get an e-mail asking me to contact them as the owner had cancelled my booking!!! Firstly wouldn't you have thought it was up to them to telephone me not the other way around, and secondly how can they get away with having your deposit for 11 months and then just cancelling the booking. The even had the audacity to ask if I would like to book another property with them :("
"Avoid Sykes at all costs they are morally corrupt! Charged 2 weeks for a 1 week holiday and mis-sold this over the phone. Said would compensate then went back on their word. Currently over 1k out of pocket. Seriously, avoid, i have seen a lot of bad reviews."
"DO NOT BOOK WITH SYKES COTTAGES!I booked a stay at Resthaven, Harwich through Booking.com. I paid £324 for the weekend. On airbnb, the price is £90 for an equivalent stay. The accommodation was dirty (e.g. blood-stained towels, filthy cups), lacked curtains, smelly, and there was hair in the beds. The shower was either boiling or freezing. I raised a complaint through Booking.com, and received a call from Sykes Cottages to discuss. I sent them photo evidence. I have received no refund. I was offered a measly £20 from Booking.com as compensation, but I want the refund that I deserve."
Good luck. Sykes dont do refunds...They as a company are the absolute worst...they dont care about anything except money. No customer care at all
Had a lovely week at the Hideaway cottage Benllech Anglesey. The accommodation was clean and comfortable with everything you needed for a home from home stay. The owners were very nice and knowledgeable of the area. Thank you.
We are currently trying to find occupants for a place that Sykes will not refund - its in Wales with a view of the caernarfon castle - if you are interested? @IanTWolverhamptonEdited: 1 year ago 
"""You can't really blame Sykes for the condition of the property.""Well actually you can. The customer books with Sykes and pays Sykes. Why would you not blame Sykes if the property is sub-standard?"
"Issue with Good Housekeeping Bond. In short owner only has to provide photos of something that is damaged along with an invoice for a repalcement. Hey presto new pillow cases and dressing gown for free, cost me £140. Sykes are powerless as they are clear in their terms that the bond is between the customer and the owner. However, there are no terms to the bond other than what I described above, a one sided process that is an easy earner for the owners."
"I recently booked a break in the Lakes, received confirmation and key access codes. Then only to be told that Sykes had cancelled it and we didn't have enough time to find something else, plus had to wait 3 working days to get our money back. I can't stress enough that you shouldn't use Sykes, they simply don't have the authority to book properties, as it's the owners who have the final say and so any booking made can still be cancelled. Appalling service and they didn't seem bothered that they had ruined our break away."
It is a shame that you had such a negative experience We have just had our third holiday with sykes and they were all superb thankyou sykes
"The problem with Sykes is that when things go well it's all ok. Issues only arise when there is a problem and then Sykes are nowhere to be seen to help, just retreating to their contract position of ""its nothing to do with them"". Good customer service shows with all companies when there is a problem, some go all out to try to help and some don't even bother. Sykes is in the latter group.I don't use Sykes anymore after renting a really unsafe house and found that Sykes didn't care and didn't help. And that house is still available to rent with all the issues and inaccurate description still present on their website.Avoid!"
"Same thing has just happened to me. 9 days before travel, I rang to query a minor detail about the accommodation and was told that the owner had sold the house and they'd only found out that morning. I wasn't important enough to be told immediately but only when I rang mid-afternoon!! Very unhelpful and showed no signs of being sorry about it. They send me some alternatives but to get something with similar facilities was going to cost me over £300 extra. I have had to make do with fewer facilities but still incurred £40 in costs which is a lot of money to me on a small pension. I've written to Which about this."
"Same here only yesterday and 9 days before the holiday! Also, earlier this year they emailed me to tell me that they'd only just found out that Northumbria Water had planned major works which would take place during the time I was due to be there and it was between me and the cove. I can't believe that Northumbria Water hadn't a much longer planning schedule than a couple of weeks!"
I can't believe it either. Our local water company tells us of planned maintenance work so far in advance that I forget about it.
Sykes cottages only care about taking your moneyHave a look at there Extortionate Cancelation feesStay well clear of em Enough said
Hi AnnetteDid you ever get your money back? We have just had this happen to us we informed them we had to cancel due to 2 deaths in the family and thought best give them as much notice as possible (5 months) yet they still took £870 and said its not their problem its in the T's & C's we are devastated as we were already in mourning and then they do this and leave us with no money for the family for the month. I contacted the owner and they weren't willing to help out at all they just said it is between us and sykes which has made us all even more angry that they won't even help either. It would be great to know if you got anywhere with it?Amy
"Horrible Company! Horrible Company!Really bad and rude customer Service, they ask you to leave a review after your holiday, leave constructive feedback so other customers don't have the same bad experience then you get an email basically accusing you of lying and they stick up for the owner without even checking on the bad points raised. Nasty people I will never ever book with them again. If you have a problem you have no chance of sorting it out. A disgrace especially Luke in customer service!"
‪Beware people ‘Secure your next holiday for £20 deposit?’ Totally pointless and a misleading statement. If you end up having to cancel (due to illness) you still have to pay the full deposit (over £300) even though it was over 60days notice! @sykescottages. Family Christmas ruined.
"Lowrifach, not to defend Sykes but did you read the t&c before you booked? See below for what they say. “Low Deposit PoliciesPlease refer to your booking confirmation or login to your customer portal for the low deposit terms and conditions which apply to your booking.*Book Now, Pay Later is available for holidays departing at least 6 weeks from the date of booking. The remaining holiday balance is payable 6 weeks prior to departure. £3 Admin fee may apply. Please note that if you cancel your booking, you will have to pay the Deposit Balance, which includes the Booking fee and may include a £3 admin fee. Book Now, Pay Later cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer. Please refer to T&Cs for full details“It seems quite clear. I’m sorry to hear that illness led to cancellation of your holiday but I hope you have travel insurance which will reimburse all/most of your costs."
I’m simply warning people that the ‘secure your holiday for a £20 deposit’ is very misleading and a totally pointless statement.
I agree with bestcornishcat its obvious that you have terms attached and its just an offer to pay a small amount when you book with the of the deposit balance later. Hope you can claim it back through your insurance and sorry to hear of the illness. The amount is likely to be less than your excess though.
"We had a simular experience, the owners took all our rubbish out of the wheelie bin and took a picture saying we left it all over the garden. We definitely did no such thing! Also tried to blame us for burn marks on an old rug they had in front of a fire that were present when we arrived! Get this they took pics saying it was feases! Omg. Took £100 from our bank to replace rug I assume not sure what cost they think putting the rubbish back in the bin cost which sykes by the way said if we put it in the bin maybe an animal took them out! Omg laughable, so an animal climbed a 7 foot wall opened a wheelie bin and took the rubbish out. Would not listen to us whatsoever, so the owners have bagged themselves £100 for nothing. A joke"
"Give the owners a bad review on TripAdvisor, its they who are in the wrong"
I’ve had nothing but bad experiences with Sykes holidays and now refuse to use them. Their customer service is worse than useless. I go out of my way to tell friends and anyone who will listen to avoid booking with them at all cost!
We booked a family group holiday with Sykes and it was a disaster. The holiday home was poorly maintained and not as advertised. When I complained to Sykes there response was to blame everything on the owner. Their get out of jail card is that they are a booking and advertising agent and the rental contract is between you and the property owner. There is little or no quality assurance from Sykes and they rated the property 5 ticks. Since 2015 Sykes had a management buyout and jumped into bed with Livingbridge who are a private equity company. Their primary interest is making money for their shareholders and they have expanded rapidly in their acquisitions of other letting agents and investing in digital marketing at the expense of customer experience/ satisfaction. Keep well away from these pirates of the commercial world... they are after your money and care very little about the product they advertise... but why should they... there is no comeback for them.. they are only a booking and advertising agent !!!
Poor Customer Services. Overcharged on a booking and was told a refund would be made on 26.11.2019 Booking ref 6WQRT-19-EN. called again a week later still no refund. Sent an email 2/12/2019 and you don't even have the decency to reply. Beware of this company overcharging you on bookings.
"You can more often than not book direct with the owner if you google the name of the place and they have online booking, you could be quids in."
"Sykes Cottages are still at it. We booked via their website at the advertised price and made all other travel arrangements only to receive an email from them 3 days later saying they had ""made a mistake"" and now the price had more than doubled. Got a terse email with sorry somewhere on it, but told to read their Terms & Conditions. Evidently, they can say what they like and then change their minds and get away with it. Absolutely dreadful customer service - or lack of. Avoid at all costs."
"I would not use this company again, in fact they have been reported to Trading Standards about the way they sold a holiday property to us. They say they re not responsible for pictures and descriptions, well even after they had my feedback about the property they were saying on live chat it had features it didn’t.Catkins in South Molton had 4 teaspoons, 1 frying pan, one pool cue no ping pong balls but sleeps 7. Were being told it had optic fibre as needed internet but could never get on it. The day before leaving my daughters asthma got bad and we relied all the damp and mould.They since have put on can be intermittent phone and WiFi, still says crisp white conservatory rather than damp and mouldy. Their terms also say they put all reviews on each property against them, funnily enough it’s not on there yet. You can see from other comments that are positive issues have been raised but they appear to have adapted the comment as it doesn’t make sense rather than leaving the review as it was.We left a day early, didn’t realise til home fibre optic was not in the area so told them about all the issues and took pictures of broken socket, stained bed sheet not slept on we spotted the morning of leaving.They say should of told them, why should we of had to have cleaners in again, also damp and internet nothing could of been done that quickly, looking now download speed etc terribly slow there because of area.We holiday 4-5 times yearly and this in opinion is never a 4 tick rated stay and I will use the other holiday cottage sites we always use that have people’s honest reviews to read against them."
I don't think you can blame Sykes for any of those complaints. It's up to the property owners to submit honest information and descriptions . All the other reviews are wonderful.
"Skyes, daylight robbery.I was thinking of booking a property and just in 2 weeks the price have rocketed up by £374. They told me it is due to demand and they cant do anything about it? I am sure the owner would not put the price up by so much for the same week. It seems to me that they put all the prices up in January and then again in mid January and continue to do so as people book properties. I am now totally put off booking anything with skyes after reading other reviews here.https:/…ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k6883117"
"Many people on independent sites talk about the same issues, they have yet to post the property review like they say they do good or bad despite agreeing with certain issues raised.People book holidays on descriptions and reviews of guests in faith that companies post all reviews of course. Luckily I have many other cottage sites I’ve stayed with who stand by their descriptions and images that people rely on to book. Good companies Will also have the properties regularly inspected by staff to check they are up to standard with equipment and cleanliness standards.Thankfully I kept evidence of live chat where the property was being sold as having a feature it didn’t, this was after leaving the holiday and them having the feedback as well.These are certainly not the standards I am used to with our holidays, but have learned a lesson on who I feel I can trust when booking my breaks. Perhaps you should look at some independent reviews of the firm, this shows the true standards of the British Travel Awards criteria as well, which says it all in my opinion."
"I would never use Sykes again either.Sorry to hijack, never posted a complaint & can’t figure this site out. Anyhow they are an in compassionate company! Don’t use them!We booked with Sykes for my mums 60th 1 year in advance. Unfortunately my dad received a terminal diagnosis 6 months later. We were still determined to go right up until 1 week prior when my dad deteriorated massively. I emailed the owners explaining the situation 3 days before we were suppose to go asking if we could have some kind of refund. I never got a reply from the owners but within the hour of my email Sykes rang me explaining that it was not their policy to give any refund. My mind wasn’t in a place to argue. My husband complained via email after this explaining under such exceptional circumstances we would appreciate some sympathy & would accept a partial refund or changing the dates to suit. The response was have you got insurance, we always recommend customers getting insurance. My response, as I now was very angry, was at the time of booking we were all fit & healthy & didn’t think it was necessary to get insurance out for a weekend away in England. Their response in addition to being very patronising was offering £70 of their vouchers as a gesture of goodwill!!!!!! Joke! I replied stating this was an insult. Life is cruel & this year my family’s lives have been turned upside down. Sykes is a big enough company to show compassion under these extreme circumstances & I believe the owners at Kiplings Lodge are partly responsible too as they could have waived some of the costs for us.Therefore be wary when booking with Sykes, they don’t care! No one knows what’s round the corner! Use an alternative company!"
"I posted a complaint to Sykes and wrote to the owner. (Sykes were happy to supply me with the owner's name and address.) I didn't even receive an acknowledgement! I've read that some people think that Sykes aren't to blame. Well I think that, because they advertise saying 'book with confidence' and are acting as agents for the owners, they really ought to take more responsibility when things go wrong. They could write it into the contracts with the owners that if they suddenly withdraw the property then they must be prepared to pay a refund or any additional costs the customers incur."
"I believe they could indeed do more to protect consumers and having more stringent contracts with owners could help.In the end, though, irresponsible or poor owners will just do what they like and won't worry about complaints. If one company boots them out they'll go elsewhere, probably Booking.com!!!"
"DO NOT BOOK WITH SYKES COTTAGESI am surprised by sykes cottages Policy. I have booked a property in 7 months from now in August in a very touristic place. Due to another cancellation, I need to cancel this booking after 8 days. They charge 674£, for a total of 2148£. Other very well known companies are much more concillient and not trying to make benefits at all cost at the depends of their customers.Edited: 7:28 am, February 03, 2020 "
"Always Book Direct with the property owner if you can. I would have changed your booking for free, or cancelled for a nominal fee."
"If this response is intended to reassure other potential customers, the fact that it took you from October to February to respond will tell them everything that they need to know about your customer service! You proved my point, don't you think?"
"As your message was dated thus...314. Re: Sykes cottages3 Feb 2020, 12:27SaveDO NOT BOOK WITH SYKES COTTAGESI replied immediately it was shown by Trip Advisor. Thank You."
Post 316 Who are you talking to? Your post makes no sense.Or did you think Sandra C was responding to your review of a property on Skye from October last year?
Many years ago I had my cottages with sykes They say they never forget that the property does not belong to them UNTRUE Our circumstances changed and were finding it very difficult to maintain both cottages we decided to sell one Sykes then became very difficult to work with and showed their true colours Customers owners beware they are NOT a sweet little family run business They are out for every penny they can get and they do not care how they do it or from whom Dont know how but they won an award last year
How very true.They are predators.
"We recently had a poor experience in one of Sykes so called luxurious properties, there was not an element of luxury in it. The place was cold & uninviting and their description was totally misleading. When I complained they just took the side of the owners & wanted nothing to do with it. Customer service is zero, I would never book with them again."
"Too late - wish I had checked on Sykes - I already regret making a booking with Sykes Cottages - extremely uncaring organization. Their only interest is their 20% commission. Hello - Cov-19 requires some flexibility in plans as all major hotels, airlines and other companies have reacted - abolishing cancellation and change fees - but Sykes..No way"

I think you'll find that they are allowing you to move the dates with no amendment fee?
"Cbel18 if you change dates you only pay more if the rate is higher for the week you choose. You could go next year at the same time for the same price, assuming rates haven't risen with inflation. I don't think Sykes would be able to relet next month if you cancelled. I would imagine their bookings have fallen off a cliff plus loads of cancellations impacting their business and their owners. Many individuals and companies are suffering. Have you tried your travel insurance company?"
Except that many cottages have no available dates in the next two years! And those that have dates are charging massive increases in prices for the same time of year. No way of contacting them by phone or email. No refunds either! Thier terms and conditions also say that they can cancel the booking but are under no obligation to offer a replacement or to offer any refund.
"SteveWhite1957, I've just looked and there's lots of availability. Also rates have not been increased they are exactly the same apart from normal seasonal increases. Sykes are offering rebooking with no amendment fee. Seems reasonable to me. I've done this for my own bookings in Spain and all guests are happy as their travel insurance does not cover it. We're probably going to be locked down soon anyway."
I wish I had read these reviews before booking my cottage. They are not refunding for holidays cancelled due to the Coronavirus. I think this is disgusting they should be giving my £1500.00 back I understand I will loose a booking fee but the whole amount!
"They are saying that they are offering different dates with no amendment fee, isn't that the case?"
"Very disappointed with Sykes Cottages. No refunds? Everyone else are refunding due to coronavirus but not these! Shame on you Sykes, you need to be flexible during this crisis, not just lining your pockets. Having read some of the other reviews it appears they aren’t very good. Won’t be using them again. EVER."
"No availability at the cottage I'd selected and no way of changing to a different cottage. No refunds and no way of contacting the customer centre, closed at 1 3:45 today because they are so busy. Staff are busy getting former customers to leave favourable reviews on Trustpilot to offset one star reviews from current customers."
No. Many Cottages have no availability and those that do have hiked their prices. No way of speaking to customer services and emails not responded to. A company taking advantage of a crisis.
Stay clear of sykes cottages they are point blank refusing to give a refund even though we have been locked down and all future dates are booked I'm probably going to lose £800 I'm so angry right now what a disgraceful unethical company
"With Corona Virus shutting down the world, Travel is now pretty much banned, Co habiting with others apart from your immediate family, A Friends wedding has ben cancelled and MOSt of the country is doing its bit to keep this country going. We find this utterly despicable company that is not offering any refunds for a trip that we now cannot take.Their rebooking for another time at highly inflated prices - on top of the money they have already stolen from us. STEAR CLEAR OF THESE HUSTLERS AND LETS SPREAD THE WORK THAT THEY ARE THIEVEING PEOPLES MONEY during a time when we want nothing more than to be a cohesive nation"
"I don't give a rat's (or any other rodent's for that matter) *** about amendment. I don't want to rebook, especially not now given these reviews and the way Sykes are handling it. What if you booked for an event which is now moved locally and you do not want to change to another date or property? Very clever, Sykes, getting everyone to pay up front then refusing refunds. Taking advantage of a pandemic is truly despicable.Edited: 7:02 am, March 25, 2020 "
"Graham Donoghue and Martin Graham sykes cottages directors are nothing more than profiteering scum bags, fleecing punters by refusing refunds even though the government, local rural communities and holiday property owners are insisting you should not travel. All attractions and many facilities are closed.. But sykes still insist on keeping your money... Utter scumbags..."
"CLOSES BARN, en-suite bathrooms, WiFi, patio with furniture, Ref 29631HognastonProfiteering by Sykes Cottages751785742I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OWNERS COMMENTS ON THIS REVIEW PLEASE..NEVER BOOKING WITH SYKES COTTAGES AGAIN.I booked this cottage months ago for family weekend to celebrate my 65th birthday arriving 8th May2020. Clearly we are now not allowed to travel to holiday accommodation following government instruction. Sykes cottages have a no refund in any circumstances policy so if I cancel (I see no alternative) they will keep my £297 deposit. If I don’t cancel I have to pay them another £520 on 27/32020 for the privilege of probably not being able to go on holiday. With there no refunds policy I will most likely loose all £800+ which does not seem right if Sykes Cottags can not provide me with this holiday? I could agree with them keeping their booking fee but why my whole deposit? I tried to ring Sykes Cottages Customer services about this only to find that they had closed there phone system down because they were too busy. No wonder with policies like these.They are offering a free amendment to another date but there customer service does not encourage me to give them any business at all.This cottage looks fantastic and if we can arrange another date with all my family some of whom are front line NHS workers and was difficult enough last time I will book this cottage again but NEVER WITH SYKES COTTAGES."
Why not book another date? You can do it online. I had to rebook mine and did this without too much problem online. I'm not losing any money just moving it. An inconvenience but in the circumstances there are more important things to worry about than having a holiday delayed.PS I'm not the owner and doubt whether owners read this thread.
They are at it again.https:/…1827406157508686
I would not recommend using this company what-so-ever. they are treating customer with absolute contempt during the coronavirus. totally refusing to give refunds despite the total lock down and will only let you rebook. just try finding any where available in what will be left of the school holiday and anything that is available is more than double the price. I cant afford to rebook and so they get to keep my money they are acting in such a disgusting manner they should be ashamed
"Covid-19 Refuses refundTerrible customer service over Covid-19, refuses to give refunds and expects you to rebook on different dates which end up costing you more money. Even though the government advise now is to travel unless absolutely necessary and and email from Sykes to say holiday is cancelled as a result, they refuse to give refunds"

"Sykes have no empathy and can not be relied upon to help or support you as a customer (or owner) in a crisis.Currently keeping every penny of every customer that had a break booked during the global pandemic and lockdown. Prices for rearranged bookings, the only alternative and must be in the same cottage, vastly inflated, some by 300%. They do not refund the difference should it be rearranged to a cheaper time but expect the huge amount more.No like for like swaps offered, no credit voucher, no credit toward a different property. They closed their call centre to avoid dealing with customers and removed their email address from the website.No empathy even with NHS workers who are now on the front line with all leave cancelled.Sykes then tried to blame cottage owners.Go direct or use another company. Ensure you check third party websites for who the property is managed by as they advertise through all of them (Booking.com etc.)"

"Sykes are just the agent, the contract is with the owner. The cottage we have booked is still physically available in April 2020 but it is the government who have intervened and said we cannot travel to it. One solution that comes to mind is we get a refund and the owners seek compensation through one of the many initiatives already in place. Any thoughts or other suggestions?"

Change to same dates next year if you can and no extra to pay. Booking in June is always dearer and nothing to do with Coronavirus. Rebooking in June is not recommended as sure lockdown will continue longer than currently planned.
"Mrs Hickson, this is not the Sykes Cottages site, its just for travelers comments on Sykes. You'll need to contact them directly on the phone or by email. (Although difficult to get through)"
"Not using this company again.I expected to loose the deposit paid when cancelling, about 10% of the final fee, so reasonable, but they are going to take a further 40% for cancelling. which they have hidden in the small print.Unethical company."
The Coronavirus put paid to our holiday in the UK this year so we cancelled three bookings with Booking.com. One booking was direct with owners though Booking and they refunded us our entire monies. The other two turned out to be run by Sykes and there was no refund. I did not expect total refund but I would have thought because of the unprecedented events where all travel is cancelled by government decree they could have relented their No refund policy.
"my work colleagues and I booked a cottage in wales for the last weekend in March 2020, because of the lockdown the week preceding the week end we couldn't go, they wont give us a refund, have offered sept 2020, at an extra £400.00, we work in a hospital in the xray dept, at the frontline of this pandemic, we were all looking forward to the week end away, but Sykes holiday cottages have been so unhelpful, certainly don't recommend this company it was not our fault, they are nothing but money grabbing people, DO NOT BOOK A HOLIDAY WITH THIS COMPANY! We paid £96.00 each for a 3 night stay, there were 10 of us, so they have pocketed a nice amount of money from hard working hospital staff,"
"Well we are Sykes owners and yes we re reading the thread. They are treating us horrendously as well. We are both key workers, my other half is NHS and I am Armed forces. They are a nightmare to get hold of and when you do they expect you to do whatever they want which has landed us in a financial mess. It's making a very stressful time even worse. They have no empathy for customers or owners they are just greedy."
There are huge hikes in the prices when rebooking - over 100% in our case. Had to cancel or be liable for the increased cost come July. Profiteers night if the worst kind
"If I could give this company zero stars then I would do. Same boat as everybody else regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. Forced with 24 hours notice to pick another date for our holiday to the lakes. Every date is £350 more expensive on top of the £761 already paid. They tell me I cannot cancel unless I wish to forfeit the money already paid and must pay the difference. I am simply not happy to do so. What an absolute sham of a company. I will be contacting the travel insurance first followed by the FCA/Ombudsman if they do not provide me with a satisfactory response.On another note my wedding has had to be rescheduled ( different companies entirely) due to the epidemic and ALL parties have done this F.O.C. Sykes are quite simply using customers to keep their business afloat/ use this situation as a means to rip people off, they ought to be ashamed."
I wish I would’ve read this review before my recent booking with them. They are very greedy company. We live in the USA and are unable to go to UK due to the coronavirus. We don’t know when will be able to take the trip to Wales in the future. The company is refusing to refund our money. This has created a hardship for everyone.That company has no mercy.
"I have used Sykes cottages in the past and have always found them to be a good company, BUT I can say I will NEVER book again with a company that makes money out of this crisis, , I hope when this is all over people remember how this company behaved, and never use them again.Edited: 12:49 pm, April 04, 2020 "
There was an item on You and Yours on BBC R4 on Friday about SykesStarts about 29 minutes in.
Sadly this is not a new thing for Sykes. I posted on here as a cottage owner in some detail about 4 or 5 years ago about their unethical cancellation policy towards owners and guests. My complaint was met with rudeness and it took me a year to leave them without incurring massive penalties. Sorry you have all been treated so badly. Just don’t use them again folks and keep spreading the word to family and friends about companies that don’t deserve your business. Only way to root out the rogues.
"under the current climate we are all on lockdown, even after paying insurance you will not get your money back from this company ,in my opinion anyone that has been affected during this lockdown and lost money to Sykes should contact trading standards The One Show ,watchdog or any other media outlet to make people aware the type of company they are dealing with, avoid at all costs or make sure you read get a a solicitor to read the very small print so you know what you’re signing up for!!"
We are yet another customer fobbed off by Sykes Cottages hiding behind their terms and conditions to feather their nest due to the coronovirus pandemic. We contacted them before the outstanding fee was taken from our account requesting cancellation as our holiday was mid May. They e-mailed after taking the outstanding fee citing their terms and conditions that no refund was due but that we could re-book at a later date. But due to the wife's work we do not know when she will be free so wish to cancel. This company should hang it's head in shame when law abiding citizens are treated in this shambolic way !
"We had a cottage booked for early may. When the government announced that vulnerable people had to be shielded for 13 weeks we tried to contact Sykes. Couldn't get through on the phone (the call centre was closed on 24th March) . No replies to emails. Tried to us the online facility to rebook but no avalability at the cottage for two years ( later found out the owner is leaving Sykes). Furter emails, further silence. Searching on- line it was clear that Sykes was profiteering from the Covid-19 crisis, increasing prices for rebooked holidays, refusing all refunds including if you found a holiday that was cheaper. Sykes Cottages is to be avoided at all costs.Edited: 1:15 pm, April 06, 2020 "
"The same experience for us as for the other April posts. We had to cancel owing to the Govt. lockdown with 4 days to go and having paid in full. They said no refunds and kept our money, unlike other accommodation providers who could not have been more helpful and charged nothing owing to the exceptional circumstances. If they stay in business, do not use them."
There is a Sykes Holiday cottages refund action group on theconsumerlawyer.blog you can register there and he is taking it further
"Hi there. there is an Sykes Hliday Cottages Refund Action Group over here on theconsumerlawyer.blog. You can register and then he is acting on our behalf.. I hope your insurance is covering you, Also look on the gov.wales website and look up Guidance notes for local authorities:holiday accommodation. As of the 7th April Wales is not permitting any use of holiday accommodation until 26th September. But being reviewed every 21 days. I would cancel your holiday the day before and then go through your insurance company. If it was booked before the date in March you should be covered. We are going through the same but Sykes cottages get around it over here by taking the balance more than 28days getting round the insurance company 28days."
HI there everyone. WE also will `NEVER book through Sykes cottages again and this had made us look at all terms and conditions before using any sites again. If airbnb can do a complete refund why can't Sykes cottages. Thankfully we booked before the march cut off date but because Sykes cottages take the money more than 28days beforehand we have to pay the balance and then claim through our insurance company. ON A POSITIVE NOTE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE OWNER of one of our bookings and he is horrified as to how we are all being treated( he is emergency services himself) and would have gladly let us have the cottage at the same price at a later date. Do really feel sorry for these owners they pay 25% of the booking costs to Sykes and they can't even get through to them. And if they withdraw they have to pay heavy penalties.

Awful company - dishonest money grabbers. The insurers they use are little better. Total waste of money - look elsewhere.
"NEVER AGAINSykes cancelled our holiday home (due early June) at Bar Harbour(Beadnell) without any notification. We found out on our account on their website.There was no offer of a refund and we had to re-book. If we hadn't we would have lost our initial deposit plus a further £250 additional deposit not yet paid.We re-booked for Sept which was actually £112 cheaper but again no refund for the difference. If we had booked for the only other available week in July it was more expensive and we'd have had to pay the difference.This is just profiteering and I doubt the profit is passed onto the owner or, as others on this site have said, that the owner is even aware.Sykes quoted their T & C's to try and explain it (after several emails and telephone calls where they contradicted themselves) but only proved the profiteering.I understand things are difficult at the present time but beware of any organisation that hides behind T & C's instead of offering customer service and remember them when the good times return.We will never use Sykes again and hope others don't.Companies like these don't deserve to survive"
"I booked for 20th June 2020 and tried phone, no answer, emailed 3 times, got back to me when asked if could change date or have to cancel.As my booking was after 14th June I was told by Sykes, We have been in touch with all are customers and they have informed us that they dont want to change dates , still hope that they can go on holiday,,,who hell kidding,,Dont now what restrictions will be, if they change Sykes, will say you can go on holiday, but every thing will be closed,, enjoy holiday,, that's what told me before full lock down was on.I have now canceled my holiday at loss £108 which I never had much option to do, see how greedy Sykes are put my week up rent at reduced price of £80 there still try get people money, no refund policy and insurance is waist time.I have used Sykes for 4 years thank God I wont use them again, They have shown there true side to there customers now and that's, disgraceful."
I wonder if you agree now. We have booked 3 cottages this year and all we are allowed to do is change dates with the same cottage and pay the extra. If it’s less they keep our money as a credit!! So we have to book with them again. Or we cancel and loose everything!! Even if we can’t go we are NOT permitted a refund. Thankfully we have insurance but we still have to pay in full and then prove that Sykes Cottages will not give a refund.
"Do not be fooled into booking a holiday with Sykes Cottages, if you cannot travel due to Covid 19, you WILL NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK. They have no empathy with customers situations and basically just say if we have got your money we are not giving it back. Thats after waiting for them to reply to emails and then waiting for 50 minutes on the phone to speak to someone."
Never use again - paid deposit for a cottage in August and then informed the next day that the cottage was no longer available so they are keeping my deposit as it is my problem? They put an ex gratis credit on my account but why would I trust them with another booking when they can not be trusted with a deposit?I pity all the holiday lets that use Sykes as they will have no business after this is over as no one should trust them with any money.
When does Sykes actually pay the holiday cottage owner? Before or after the booking?
"I sympathise with you not easy to get a response from sykes, take today 3 different phones all calling at the same time and no answer on any well over an hour.Sykes are poorly managing this covid 19 crisis."
i had to cancel a holiday with sykes their advice was to take out insurance which i did.i believed doing this would mean i would be covered should i need to cancel.but no they say the full deposit is payable if i cancel.my understanding of this is the insurance was a waste of money.i have e-mailed sykes appealing for compassion(my wife is 76 corona virus worries) and hope they will in the interest of customer relations refund me the money they say is due .
Sorry for your situation but I doubt it. I'm a former owner and Sykes have been behaving badly for years as this thread shows. Radio 4 You And Yours programme has been covering this. Suggest you all bombard them with messages. Nothing like bad publicity to get some action. Good luck everyone.
"I have been shocked by Sykes treatment of me.They wrote to me on 7th May and told me my holiday was going ahead and that financial penalties of at least the full deposit and up to the whole cost of the holiday would be payable if I cancelled.Then on 8th May they requested the money from my account.On 11th May in the morning the money cleared my account. That SAME afternoon the wrote to me again to inform me my holiday had been cancelled! Sykes suggested I booked the same cottage for 1 years’ time, with no offer of a refund. They would hold onto my money until then. Obviously, the same cottage for the same week would now cost an additional £136. I believe Sykes are actively trying to get customers to book as early as possible, knowing full well that the holidays will probably be cancelled. They offer a low deposit option, however as soon as you pay the low deposit you become liable for the full amount if you cancel. Also, when you pay for the holiday in full and they then cancel, you will not be offered a refund. Instead they will hold onto your money for over a year. Some companies seem to be using Covid-19 as an excuse to treat their customers badly, to take as much money as possible from them and to hold onto it for as long as possible. I hope we will remember those companies and individuals who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 and did all they could to help and serve one another. I also hope we will no longer use those companies that took advantage of the situation and treated people poorly."
"Last year I booked and paid in full for a holiday with Sykes. I was due to go in less than 2 weeks when they cancelled due to COVID19. They have all my money and won't respond to my numerous emails over the last 4 weeks. On Trust Pilot, one other unfortunate customer helpfully posted that she contact Citzens Advise on line. She also reported Sykes to Government agency looking into practises from bad companys during COVID 19 (go to Gov.uk and search for CMA) and also got her MP to write to the company. I am now following these suggestions and also looking into legal proceedings against Sykes. Good luck to you all, I hope you get your money back."
"Many Holiday Let owners advertise on several websites such as Homeaway, Airbnb etc. So it's very easy to get double bookings."
"2020. I booked and fully paid for a SYKES Holiday Cottage in Skye in early June 2020. Because of the Covid-19 I now cant travel to the location OR use that accommodation. I cant move the booking to a later date in 2021 as the owner has now pulled the property from the SYKES Holiday Cottage list. Their Customer Services told me a month ago that their Task Force will contact me about this. I did suggest moving the booking to another cottage that was free in 2021, but my money is stuck in the payment for the first property and the Customer Services said they have to get authority to release that cash. After various calls and emails I've had no response from SYKES Holiday Cottages and they have now closed the Customer Services line. I suspect they are about to go bust so have stopped speaking with customers. In May 2020 I would strongly suggest NOT using this company."
"They take a big chunk themselves (possibly 20%) and only pay the owner a smaller amount. It seems payment times vary. If you pay a large deposit up front they take most and the owner may get a small amount and the rest later. If you use the £20 booking fee and pay the balance closer to the day the owners have to wait for payment. I would suggest if you find a nice property on SYKES Holiday Cottages, look for the same cottage on Google on its own web site, as it will be a LOT cheaper if you book direct with the owner."
"Sykes cottages have been horrendous during this lockdown. we had a trip booked for 10 people for early may, we are unable to rebook for other dates but still haven't received any sign of a refund. You can't get through on the phones and are lucky to get any sort of reply by email (usually an automated reply). And to add insult to injury i am constantly getting marketing emails to book another holiday. I will never use this company again, its an absolute sham."
"Annie,While I sympathise with your predicament at the hands of this Company, the CMA has only given what it *thinks* is the Law - there is no stated case or precedent to back up their theory.Legal Action probably wouldn't get you anything either, as Sykes would most likely go into voluntary liquidation, leaving you at the end of a long list of creditors."
"It is difficult for me to put into words just how disappointed I have been with this company (Sykes Holiday Cottages) not once have they answered the telephone despite me calling on over 17 occasions and waiting up to one hour at times.We had a holiday cottage booked in Wales which we were not allowed to visit under the governments rules and I was also required to shield for 12 weeks due to a medical condition as instructed by my doctor. Both these regulations made it impossible for us to have our holiday. Despite these issues Sykes cottages took £265 from our bank and refused us a refund.We have only received standard generic emails and the company has refused to enter into any meaningful dialogue with us at all. These are difficult times and most companies seem to be playing fair, this company is however profiteering from the situation. I have contacted the ombudsman. Please avoid this company in future and tell anyone you know about how they are trying to profiteer from this present crisis that is upon us. It is important that we remember the bad companies once COVID 19 has passed..."
"Very disappointed with Sykescottages policy that does not take into consideration current exceptional situation with the pandemic. Impossible to amend bookings after July 3rd for Ireland even though there are restrictions in place and quarantine in the country. How are we expected to use a one week booking when quarantine is in place ? How are we meant to have a holiday when all entertainment is closed up to August 10th ? Any other holiday rental website, airlines, holiday makers accept to give vouchers or amendments in this very special situation."
"Sykes have been on my blacklist for ages, anyway!"
"Do not do business with this shameful organisation Relationships with service providers are either cemented or decimated by moments of truth when values and integrity are tested. The approach taken by Sykes in response to the onset of the Corona virus epidemic has been shameful. None of the parties to the booking arrangement was responsible for the fact that the Corona Virus necessitated the cancellation of the booking and rendered the contract for services null and void. And yet from the outset Sykes belligerently refused to provide a refund and sought to obviate its responsibilities in facilitating that solution. The complete absence of telephone support and non-response to emails only exacerbated the dreadful experience for customers impacted by the booking cancellations. I believe that the culture and integrity of organisations is set from the top. The fact that Graham Donoghue (CEO) chose to ignore correspondence sent to him by recorded delivery at both his home and work address, speaks volumes as to the arrogance and discourtesy which permeates the Sykes business. No doubt they will be dragged kicking and screaming by the Competition and Markets Authority to provide the reimbursements to which their customers have always been entitled, but all good faith with customers has long since been destroyed. My advice to all future potential customers of Sykes is to avoid dealing with this company at all costs."
"Awesome, this review speaks for so many of us who have been abused by Sykes cottages. Please keep us all updated on any progress you make.Is there anything our group of customers can do collectively.I have noticed that Trust Pilot has suddenly received dozens of glowing 5 star reports on this shabby company which tells me that they are writing their own reviews..."
"Trouble is that a lot of owners advertise with more than one agency, and may also have their own website for bookings. They are a business, so they'll take whichever booking makes them the most money. If they don't notify the other agancies, then it's hardly the agencies fault is it?"
"After removing a significant part of our accommodation purposely just before the full payment came out, they refuse to answer to reason or communicate regarding our complaint but still take all the money. We feel absolutely screwed over. We’ve just had a generic response blaming corona when there’s no conceivable reason why. They only care about one thing, and it’s not your holiday.Check this out from their T&Cs!18.2 To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, we disclaim any and all promises, warranties, conditions, or representations relating to the Booking Service, whether express, implied, oral or written.Very slippery company with zero accountability for their service. We strongly advise you AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

"AVOIDThe cottage itself I cannot fault, however avoid Sykes cottages dreadful company.I needed to change the holiday due to Covid and was charged a £30 admin fee but instead of taking this charge they took the full amount, that shouldn’t be due until May 2021. Unable to speak to anyone by phone and after chasing them by e-mail I received a partial reimbursement that took them 4 weeks. The reason for not repaying the full amount back is due to 30% deposit now being needed, which when booked last year was £20 - the lower deposit is nw no longer available. Never mentioned at the time of changing the booking, as was told would only be charged £30.I was directed to their T&C""11. We reserve the right to withdraw The Offer at any time12. By making a Booking with us, you confirm that you accept all these terms and conditions and that you agree to comply with them.""I would avoid this company, they have no customer service and not a good firm from my experience, they will not even speak with you in person. I would find an alternative company!"
Those sound like standard conditions to me - I'd be willing to get that any rental company has something very similar in their agreements too.
"Due to Covid, you're cancelling a holiday booked for May 2021?Do you know something we don't?"
"No when we postponed the trip to, originally we booked for this year.Edited: 8:56 am, June 16, 2020 "
The deposit was at the lower rate when originally booked we only postponed the holiday. The lower deposit that applied when originally book was what made this company seem appealing.

Have you or any o e else had any joy with Sykes since the CMA ruling last Friday to give full refunds for booking affected by Covid 19? I am having exactly the same problem HomeAway UK.
"They are still playing hard ball. They are not even taking phone calls now. Terrible, terrible company. Avoid"
Hi have used skyes never had any trouble today a lovely caring lady helped me change our holiday Called Lisa we have moved holiday to next year as my husband is clinically extremely vulnerable with blood cancer would not feel happy going at the moment would not be able to do the normal holiday things So thank you skyes
Funny this last post being the persons only post and a new account. Sounds like a fake to me...Probably set up by Sykes staff
"#2Sorry, you're wrong - it's *not* ""basic admin"". Whatever their faults, Sykes (and most of these other sites) have no control over the Cottages they advertise, so if an owner receives a better offer, whether it's a longer hire period or a higher per week rental income, they'll take it, for many owners, this is their pension."
Mengarth home Cadgwith CoveThis property has lovely plants and lovely objects BUT it is dirty . I’ve cleaned all the bathrooms and windows and doors on arrival . The steps on entry are really steep be warned Two houses are being done up nearby so it’s like a building site here The fridge is dirty I’ve cleaned it all If you come bring lots if cleaning cloths it needs it On the road into Cadgwith there are a total of 3 houses being worked on . The building noises start at 8 amGood luckIf it wasn’t for the virus we would have left after a few days The place though once I’m sure fab needs a really good clean everywhere x
I have had a similar problem with HomeAway UK. We were unable to take up our villa in Tenerife due to covid 19 restrictions. They have failed to offer any refund apart from the booking fee. The CMA has ruled that full refunds should be given.
"#414Homeaway are just an advertising platform or agent. If you look at their terms and conditions, it clearly states that any contract is between you (the traveller) and the property owner not Homeaway, so they've refunded what they can probably as a goodwill gesture, since they've done their job by passing your booking and money to the property owner.The CMA has not ""ruled"" on anything - they have just stated what (in their opinion) the Law says, as there is no stated case or precedent in place, someone will have to take a company to Court - and possibly through the appeals process - to get any money back. As Homeaway is owned by Expedia, I wish them the best of British with that!"
"412, I don't think that's right. All the agencies I know of manage the holiday lets on the owners' behalf. The site would not allow a property to be booked twice and the owners are not usually given the name an contact details of the guests until the day or so before they start their holiday.I can't see how the owners can manipulate holidays simply because the owner doesn't manage the bookings it's the agency.I have friends who let their houses as holiday lets in summer and that's how it works for them."
"#416Yes, that's how it *should* work!I also know people who let property, and they are registered with 2 or 3 Agencies, simply because it gives them more chance of their properties being occupied for the maximum time. At the end of the day, the owner is still the owner and obviously has the final say as to who they allow to stay there and when. Unless they can be shown to be doing it in a discriminatory way there's not a lot anyone can do about it.Edited: 9:03 am, July 29, 2020 "
Due to the thousands of complaints made to the CMA Sykes have given an undertaking that they will refund customers whose holidays were affected by the pandemic. We rebooked our holiday under duress; were told to rebook or lose the money. We complained to Sykes and after months of wrangling have now received a full cash refund (we also refused the ex-gratia credit for part of it). Useful information on the Sykes Unhappy Customers page on Facebook.
"Even if they do get a 'better offer' the first booking should be honoured. The customer is tied into a legally binding contract so would lose their money if they found something better. It's time unfair terms and conditions were challenged.I'll be starting with the CMA.Such behaviour does not bode well for owners' future businesses if there is no trust left.Edited: 4:48 am, August 01, 2020 "
"#419Sounds perfectly reasonable, but how would you prove which booking came first? When is a contract made on receipt of a request or when a deposit is paid into the Owner's Bank Account? Even at the lower evidential standard of the Civil Courts - which is 'on the balance of probabiity' - it would be difficult to prove any of those.Another thing to consider is that Contracts have to be fair to both sides - if property owners perceive them as biased towards the consumer, they'll simply sell up, reducing availability and force prices up in whatever area.The easiest way to avoid ""unfair"" contracts is to *read them* before signing and if you don't like the terms either negotiate or go elsewhere, just as you do when you apply for a job."
"If owners can't keep a grip on their bookings then perhaps they should try harder or not be involved with several agencies at the same time. The main problem faced by customers who could not take their holidays is when they want their money back. No one would pay for something and then when it can't be supplied expect to lose their money.Yes contracts do need to be fair to both parties, who said anything about them being biased towards the customer. I have had first hand experience with them so can speak from that. The thousands of members on the Sykes Unhappy Customers page on Facebook can't all be wrong.I had two holidays booked with Sykes which should have been taken during the pandemic both booked last year and they refused to refund. After the CMA got involved they very reluctantly repaid one whilst trying to keep a large portion back as an ex gratia credit on our account. The other one we cancelled before paying the final balance rather than give them any more money. We have also had that back now. Sykes gave an undertaking to the CMA that they would deal with refunds to affected customers by 31 July and if they fail to do so then the CMA can take legal action against them (it's available to read on the CMA website) I took out holiday insurance with them too which was also refunded because it wasn't fit for purpose.A third holiday booked last year for this September with another agent was cancelled two weeks ago because the owner has decided the cottage will not be available for the week we booked, if that's a double booking then it has taken them a long time to realise. They too offered an e-voucher. We refused that and have had that refunded too but none of that has been straightforward. I did read the terms and conditions but obviously nowhere does it say if there is a worldwide pandemic then you can whistle for your money. Yes I have gone elsewhere and will never use them again. I can't see what going for a job has to do with paying for goods or services, totally different terms and conditions and you don't part with hundreds of pounds so not a valid comment."
"As I understand it, the deposit isn't paid to the owners when it's paid by the guest at booking. It's kept by the agency and the owners only get the deposit when the balance is paid and they then get the full amount (less agency fees of course).Therefore this scenario shouldn't happen. All the local agencies I know, operate like this. The owners do not get involved with the booking system but are advised when someone has booked. Often they have no idea of the names or contact details of the future guests. If there are any problems, the guest is told to contact the agency first, who then pass it on to the owners, depending on what it is.This is also how it works with Airbnb in terms of deposit and balance payments.Edited: 11:21 am, August 01, 2020 "
"#421A Contract is a Contract, regardless of what it's for - when you go for a job interview you ask questions about the terms and conditions and if you don't like them, you negotiate a change, if they won't, you go and work for someone who's terms you do like. Same with goods and services - you ask about terms and if you don't like/agree with them then you ask for changes, if they won't, go elsewhere. Simples!"
"Because it's Simples might be why the CMA have intervened and why some people are now getting refunds. As I said before I have had experience with Sykes as a customer and my grievance is because I had paid £1,200 and was expected to walk away. No way. I wouldn't bother being on this forum if I hadn't had a problem with them, I've got better things to do than go on forums to make comments about companies I've had no dealings with.Edited: 12:22 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"#424You got lucky, Sykes obviously decided they wanted to stay in business. The CMA has no power to order anyone to do anything, they have to go to Court just like you and me."
"Of course, that's why Sykes have given an undertaking to refund affected customers. If they fail to then the CMA can take legal action. If customers read the CMA website and search Sykes they will learn the facts rather than just read the views of unaffected or ill-informed people.Edited: 6:11 am, August 02, 2020 "
Is there an email address for them? I can't contact them and have attempted since May as I changed a booking to 2021 and paid more but then they cancelled that booking. phone calls not going through and cant find any other way to contact them
427This is their email. Good luck!nfo@sykescottages.co.ukLousy company...
"#426There is also the option for Sykes (and it's associated companies) to go into administration of course. Since they will have a severely tarnished reputation, be facing a downturn in bookings as a result as well as property owners removing their properties, those in charge might consider that to be a viable option.A quick ""phoenix"" to a Company in a different name(s), and they can carry on from where they left off."
Thank you. Was that supposed to be info@ or nfo@ ?
infoSorry xx
"Thanks to the CMA I've now got a full refund so couldn't care less if they do go bust. I will not be booking with an agent again and the thousands of other people who have had dealings with not just Sykes but other agencies acting the same way should avoid them too.As you said in previous responses, if you don't like the terms and conditions don't accept them. There was never anything in the terms and conditions which stated that if a cottage was withdrawn for any reason, they could keep the money or that we had to accept an e-voucher for a future booking.Edited: 4:48 am, August 10, 2020 "
"I have seen owners of cottages with Sykes denounce Sykes. My experience:what a low review value:1.12 out of 5.not surprised; read on.have you noticed that one cannot leave tripadvisor or google reviews for cottage managed by sykes?regarding the expensive cottage we rented:1) we had been given incorrect key code so after 8 hour journey could not enter.2) upon entering, cleanliness was low level; no airing ( this was end of july some years ago and we were first visitors... we should have smelled a rat... first visitors in july in cornwall in looe ?!)3) broadband did not work. sykes told us to contact the owners (details in manual). manual was found behind sofa under ironing board! some days later that was fixed.4) boiler failed. no hot water. told to leave key under mat so some unknown plumber could enter house and fix it. under my management i would have arranged a plumber to arrive at renters convenience. we paid for a plumber to come whilst we we in residence rather than risk rifling of of our possessions whilst we were out enjoying cornwall.sykes absolutely refused to reimburse.terrible, awful company.rent cottage via a different company would be my advice.https:/…sykes-cottages"
Booked with Sykes 6/8. For 4 nights from 16/8. Didn’t find out until tonight when checked the app for further details of how to get there and the booking had disappeared. Turned out they had cancelled the booking and refunded us on 12/8. They said it was double booked. No notification or anything. Customer call centre service appalling. Lucky we didn’t make the 3 hr trip and turn up. Looks like we were bumped off in favour of a 7 night break! Said we should be happy with the refund! On the phone an hour and spoke to 2 call centre staff who would not escalate the complaint. Merely said they would “feedback” !1
"Yes, I agree, Sykes Cottages should be more helpful if people cancel due to Coronavirus. My husband is in the clinically extremely vulnerable group so we could not take up our booking, but Sykes have so far completely ignored my requests for a refund, although the property was re booked immediately the day after I cancelled. The phone lines are impossible - you stay on the line for more than an hour if you want to speak to someone, and emails are ignored after they have sent you an automatic response. I have written to the CEO and had three emails completely ignored. After a month I have at last managed to speak to someone helpful in Customer Relations - hooray! You never know, I may get my refund !"
"Further to my post of yesterday I'm delighted to say that I have received an email from Sykes Cottages telling me they are going to refund our payment. So, if you have a problem, my advice is to keep on phoning and writing and eventually you will find someone helpful who will act fairly . Good wishes to everyone, and happy holidays to those who can get away this year."
This is the worst company we ever dealt with. We booked in January for cottages in Cheshire and Eire and have had to cancel due to Covid-19. Being 71 and 70 we are in a very vulnerable age group. Also as we are Canadians we would have to isolate for 14 days if we traveled against our Government's advice. They refuse to refund the deposits even though both cottages have been re-rented.
