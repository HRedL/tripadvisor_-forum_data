At least a couple of months too late sadly.
"The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. - horse, bolted already?"
"Yes, stable door finally to be closed. And how come a full plane flew from Belfast to London? Were all the passengers going to buy essential items or take exercise inLondon? Did nobody who sold , issued or checked a ticket, operated any sort of checkin, flew the plane or worked as flight attendant ask themselves if it was a good idea? What did this do for anybody’s insurance cover?"
"At Vienna Airport you can get a test on arrival, a negative result means you avoid a 14 day quarantine. Why can't the UK government do the same?"
"As some have said, a bit too late.One of my female relatives has been touring the Far East for the last 18 months, to China (twice), Taiwan, Hong Kong, Bali, Korea, Nepal, and other Far East places. About 6 weeks ago, once the virus began to take hold and countries were banning flights they decided to fly home to the UK, from Taiwan, via Singapore, then via Dubai, then to Stansted.When they landed in the UK **NOBODY** at the airport asked where they had been and there was no advice given about isolation or anything like that. Once home in the UK they began wearing masks if they went shopping.In one shop one person had a go at them about wearing masks and he said ""Waste of time, they wont protect you"".They argued back it is to protect YOU from US in case we have Coronvirus.Nearly turned in to a fight!Even though this is a close female relative of mine, I have only seen her once briefly since she got back (when she sat in her car outside our house) and I have not been able to give her a ""welcome home"" hug even though I had not seen her for over 18 months."

"Ho hum.The scientists have explained ad infinitum that while the virus is spreading widely in the community, albeit with a R0 below 1, and while everyone is required to stay at home in most cases and socially distance when out, the additional risk was minimal. Everyone HAS more or less been quarantined, regardless of whether they’re a new arrival or not. They always said that once lockdown started to be lifted some sort of quarantining was likely to be introduced.The time when, with hindsight, it should have been brought in was February (and people seem to forget that for some groups it was - not just self-quarantine but actual quarantine). As has been pointed out many times, if you look back in this forum to late February you will find everyone poo-pooing the idea that there was any significant danger. The uproar if quarantine had been introduced then would have been immense."

shutting the stable door after the virus has bolted
Was mentioned in the address to the nation tonight but no detail given. Hopefully it won't include EU nationals as we could see other countries impose one in retaliation. Much of Europe is in the same position as us in as far as they have all reached the same stage as us. We also need to ensure that the airlines don't go to the wall whilst ensuring that the progress we have already made.
People arriving from France and Ireland won’t need to quarantine for 14 days. No news yet if any other countries will be exempt.
"Much of Europe is in the same position as us in as far as they have all reached the same stage as us.--Much of Europe is in a better position than the UK, one could argue."
<< Hopefully it won't include EU nationals >>I'm expecting it to be stringent and to include UK people who are finally managing to return home
"It's not nationality that matters, it's where you've been.Imposing quarantine on arrivals from countries with low infection rates doesn't really make sense - people are far more likely to be affected by someone already in the UK than by someone arriving from Greece or Latvia. Quarantine ought to be introduced selectively only for those countries where Coronavirus seems to be out of control, such as Russia and the USA."
"I'm an American who arrived in the UK on March 17 from a trip that included a Nile cruise, where there had been an outbreak on a different cruise ship. I was armed with 10 days' of daily temperature reports from the ship and expected to answer some questions. I was also planning on self-quarantining for 14 days, just to be sure I wasn't infected. My e-gate told me to see a person, which didn't surprise me. The immigration officer asked where I'd come from, and although my flight originated in Munich, I'd started in Cairo, so I told her that. Her response was ""Welcome to the UK"". No questions, no suggestion to self-quarantine, nothing.I'm hoping to come back to the UK in September, and am perfectly happy to hole up for 2 weeks in order to do so."
"At present, the PM has just said that a Quarantine period, from today, will be introduced for people arriving to the UK by Air. Not yet telling us how long that quarantine period might be and if anyone might be exempt from it. Neither did he say when the Quarantine would be re-considered.All of that will come, or he will be questioned on it, when he makes a Statement to Parliament, this afternoon at Westminster.CheersAnthony K"
What is the rationale for excluding France.I can understand Ireland given the open border with Northern Ireland etc but why France and not say Greece which has way less cases?And why not include trains and ferries?
"El DTHe simply did bullet points yesterday evening. Thus only saying airports, but surely meaning Eurostar and Ports. He did not mention exemptions to Quarantine ... listen to him, in Westminster, today, when flesh is applied to the bones and he faces, hopefully answers, questions.CheersAnthony K"
"That's not what he said, he merely indicated that ""I am serving notice that it will soon be the time - with transmission significantly lower - to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air."""
How would it get policed? The hours needed for his will be huge.
“How would it get policed”?Eh! Your passport would get scanned as it does now and it would show where you have came from!
"According to the BBC this morning, France was given an exemption because the UK is exempt from French restrictions. Apparently, they didn't initially get the exemption, so President Macron threatened to remove the UKs exemption."
"Running it and Policing it, will all be spelled out but it will begin from Today. Expect and accept it. EU national and Shengen area countries, eg Switzerland, may get exemptions.Anthony K"
"By and large there is no more chance of someone arriving in this country having the virus than there is for anyone already here, except for the fact that they have been cooped up in a plane for some time with lots of other people. If one person on that plane was infected when they boarded, there could be 20 others by the time they get here. So from that angle you have an identifiable group of people with higher than average risk.Another identifiable group of people with higher than average risk is those stopped by the police and found to be breaking the rules of lockdown. If anyone in this position, whether fined or simply warned, was quarantined for 14 days, it would both serve a purpose and also act as rather more of a deterrent than what is happening now."
"Will it mean that cabin crew will be in permanent quarantine?Edited: 3:45 am, May 11, 2020 "
Re post 29. If that happens then the airlines will breath a sign of relief. It will throw a lifeline to tourism which has been badly hit by the virus. But will the loophole of transiting through Dublin be closed. Technically anyone doing this is arriving in the UK from Ireland and there are no checks on arrival. Transiting Dublin only means a very brief check of the passport and perhaps a question about final destination.
What I meant was how will the police ensure that everyone is self isolating for 14 days. They don’t even come out for minor crimes now. And what about getting to your accommodation as the majority of people will be using public transport.
"#29AFAIK the only Countries with an exemption are the Republic of Ireland and France. Presumably, since the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the Government doesn't have to give all EU Citizens the same exemption."
You sure. We’re still bound by EU rules in the transition period which ends in December I think.
"What EU rule are you talking about...in the last 2 months or so, most of the EU countries closed their borders and did not allow crossborder traffic.Besides, all this is merely a speculation until the situation becomes clearer, hopefully this afternoon.Edited: 5:00 am, May 11, 2020 "
"#30, I don’t think the virus infects people like that. Chances are that if someone does board a flight and are infected they will pass on to 2/3 others. The problem then is if those 2/3 don’t know they have been infected they will in time pass it on to 2/3 more and so on."
"RichardWe are in Transition, until at least 31st December 2020. This means, that for European travel, cross-borders, we are classified as EU members, if the 27 countries wish to accept EU, UK & Shengen citizens. CheersAnthony K"
"Morning 08.40, local, H25 Hoppa Bus. Only passenger, for whole journey last Thursday. This morning, 08.40, H25, only me got on at start of route, 10 more people between Butts Farm and Hanworth Park, ten minutes later ... no chance of 2 metre distancing, passengers, strangers, sitting cheek to cheek, and chatting away, One out of fourteen was wearing a mask.Anthony K"
Just shows that what they said last night about public transport is not going to work. People need to use it as not all can drive and for many walking or biking it is not an option. Don't usually advocate the routine wearing of masks but in this case it could be that Germany and Greece are right on this one.
"#35 & #38No, I'm not sure, which is why I said ""presumably"".It would appear that the Government is thinking that way, as (from what was said in the BBC this morning) they have only given the exemption to France and Ireland, not the whole of the EU."
The wording is 'travellers from France'... Invitation to lots of people to travel to France and then to the UK redendering the quarantine fairly useless.
"If they give the exemption to one EU member, they HAVE to give it to all of them. That is European law (and a reminder has been issued this morning) and the UK has to continue to apply EU law until at least 31 December.What the UK COULD do lawfully would be to apply it to anyone arriving by air (including from the RoI and France) but not by land/sea routes (Eurostar, Eurotunnel and ferries)."
Would be difficult to police given the numbers. If passengers from other EU countries have the right to travel by air without having to go into quarantine then that right would apply to us as well. Seems like an ill thought through policy done on the back of a fag packet.
"In one case I am waiting for just £15 refunded from a Theatre Agent, for a May show.I have had two e-mails ...

Are there any flights operating between France and the UK? I checked for flights between Dublin and London airports - at the moment there are two Aer Lingus flights from LHR and one Ryanair flight from both Stansted and Gatwick.
Are there any flights operating between France and the UK?AF between CDG and LHR and Manchester
"Thanks Tilly, that does surprise me."
"Adam, I've been plane spotting for the last 6 weeks..(when I don't go fishing)"
"Well if it really is passengers from France but not the rest of the EU, that is pretty stupid. I live 5 km from the French border, so with the French opening up domestic travel, I will be able to hop over the border and catch a train even though flying from Geneva would be more convenient."
"I expect the agreement is French nationals, those with French passport."
"Your passport would get scanned as it does now and it would show where you have came from!>> No it doesn't. Scanning the passport does not reveal your travel history. I expect the agreement is French nationals, those with French passport.>> Unworkable, I suspect. Just because someone holds a French passport doesn't mean they live there."
So you could go anywhere in North America via Dublin and no one would be any the wiser. Mist immigration officers are only interested in the photo page and would not go flicking through it to look for any stamps. So the whole plan has many loop holes.
"Stanley Johnson - has applied for French citizenship, his son decides that you don't need quarantine for travel from FranceYou can play tennis - Boris likes playing tennisYou can get a nanny - Boris needs a nannyCoincidence?"
"<<< So you could go anywhere in North America via Dublin and no one would be any the wiser. >>>I think you mean ""come from anywhere in North America"". And I haven't checked, but I assume Ireland will also be imposing a 14 day quarantine on anyone not coming from the UK. If not, it makes no sense as you say."
The same coincidence that we are told children don't get sick from the virus so schools remain open...........then during lockdown it's proved that they can and maybe seriously or then when the schools need to reopen - they don't get it again.Same coincidence that there seem there;s not immunity if you've had it but we are all working towards 'herd immunity'Frankly I'm not sure I trust any of the so called information we are given except social distancing until someone gives some substantial facts and it's backed up by science.
"Possibly the least considered option possible with few parameters determined before the announcement made. It's not quite from the Helen Lovejoy 'won't somebody please think of the children!' school of thought but it's not far off, and certainly from the Something Has to Be Seen to Be Done (even though we don't know what will really happen when if we manage this) playbook.No, wait. The cack-handed and daft loosening of lockdown ... is that an even more poorly considered pronouncement? Mmm no, the quarantine is sillier."
"I expect to travel to, from Heathrow, and from Paris in early September, not quarantining on arrival and, probably quarantining when I arrive home, for fourteen days. Keep well allAnthony K"
At Dublin you would be a transit passenget so you don't enter the republic itself. There would be no need to quarentine anyone who is not actually staying and make it a British headache. The UK government would not have power over this loop hole. Aer Lingus may be very busy over the coming months or into next year if this madness persists. The timing is wrong but nothing durprises me with the wsy the crisis has been handled.
"#59 can't be totally true, can it? If it was anyone could enter the UK without going through Immigration simply by transiting through Dublin. The Common Travel Area, and say Schengen, operate by having the same entry requirements at all points, and transit within the area counts as internal travel. Quarantine requirements would be imposed at the entry point. Surely?"
"Ryanair are going to start flying 40% of their flights as from July 1 Michael O ‘Leary has just stated on Good Morning Britain.He said they would start flights to Spain France Ireland Portugal and other destinations.Passengers would have to wear face masks at all times in the airport and on the flight and they would have to take a temperature test before entering the airport .When Piers Morgan asked him about 14 day quarantine upon returning to U.K.Michael O ‘ Leary dismissed this as a concernThere will be millions of passengers returning and the authorities cannot possibly police it .Spain have announced that they will be bringing in a 14 day quarantine for incoming passengers So more confusionEdited: 3:44 am, May 12, 2020 "

"Michael O’Leary has long had a marketing strategy that depends almost entirely on him saying something sensational so that he can be interviewed about it in TV and in the press, thus getting the company’s name in front of the public. Whether it bears any relation to reality is entirely coincidental. The most egregious example, if you remember, was to have all its passengers perched on standing seats."
"I can't be the only one who got an email from Ryanair inviting me to book flights for Summer 2021 at just the same time as the 14 day quarantine was mooted. Now it didn't seem to me to make any sense to book a flight that I might well now be disinclined to take, but I have in the past gambled £9.99 on a bargain, and been prepared to write it off if my plans didn't materialise.But these Summer 2021 prices were a minimum one way of £40, which is about the most I've ever paid for a Ryanair flight. Flying to or from Spain on a Sunday was at least £200! Now it may be that they are just trying to exploit the desperate and gullible, but it makes me think that whatever else happens, Ryanair thinks low cost travel is dead."

"The OED defines leader as a person who leads a group of people, especially the head of a country, an organization, etc. Presumably that task should also include the ability to consider information, assess situations, review options and make decisions based on the best available information at the time.Leadership seems to be lacking in several countries around the world and will have consequences more notable than directly virus-related.

"Hi Yuri! *waves*I used to be proud to say I was English and from England and the UK, or Great Britain (or whatever they call it now).Not patriotic as in all of that Britain First and EDL bollox, but proud to be from such as great country. Now I'm not so sure!We are up there with the USA for having one of the most useless, bumbling, corrupt governments in the Universe! But come the next General Election I can guarantee that the useless, inept Tories will get voted in again; mainly by the working class voters who turned their backs on Labour, and by the middle class Toffs who are only interested in £$£$£$£$£$£$.I am no longer proud to be English!

"Hi Matt,You’re not laughing stock to me, nor to anyone I know. I don’t think anyone is laughing about British misfortune anywhere. What’s funny? Number of dead?I don’t think it was politically sourced failure. This party, or another one - wouldn’t change much.Apparently, this pandemic has it’s parabolic curve. You’re over the peak. From now on, things will only get better.I’ve lost all hope for visiting England in July. It’ll be first Summer in many years that we won’t be visiting UK. My children still find it difficult to swallow.I hope to be able to visit London in October...Keep safe!Yuri"

What about the ones who are UK resident and don't need to isolate. Will they be separated from the migrant workers?"

"God willing, quarantine continues. Masks, six foot distance help, but thses steps are not the cure nor vaccine."
Hi YuriWhich October are you wishing to visit London? This year or in 2021. The quarantine measure is politically linked to the immigration bill that is currently going through Parliament at the moment. The message that is being sent out is far from ineptitude - which is true and more linked to Brexit. Basically they are telling the world that Britain is closed and will be closed for the foreseeable future. This latest measure may still be around long after the virus has become the threat that it is now. It may yet unravel as the French are threatening to do the same which could hit our supply chains as cross channel transport could be unworkable.
"Hi Philip,I’ve got flights with EasyJet in October 20 ( being postponed from this March because of Coronavirus outbreak ).I’ve read about French turning this thing into political. Shame.Yury."
But that is the French for you. Any retaliation will hurt us badly as they are likely to apply it to road haulage as well as our fishing industry which relies heavily on exports to Europe. Makes no sense as lorry drivers and others who are exempt could just as easily pick the virus up as anyone else. Are they not going to visit cafes etc on route? Madness.
There are 42 categories of people who are exempt from the self isolation requirements.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…
"Hi all,Hope you are all well, wondering if anyone could answer my question, please.I was supposed to travel to Peru in August this year, starting from Stockholm having a connecting flight in London (Stockholm - London - Lima). Will it be possible for me to skip the 2 weeks quarantine if I do not leave the airport awaiting my second flight to Lima? Apologies in advance in case a similar scenario has already been described/explained here, hard to get through all the posts with a 1,5 year-old kid. Many thanks in advance!Thomas"
By August there may be no quarantine. The current proposals seem to be getting adapted by the hour so in truth no one can tell you what will be happening a couple of months in advance.
"Hi there, Many thanks for your reply, you are right, let's hope it will be gone by August. If I wanted to travel to Peru via London during the quarantine then, do you know if I'd be forced to wait 2 weeks in UK before taking my flight to Peru?"

"Post 162. The quarantine measure I fear may still be with us in August and beyond. Pritti Patel has made it clear to Parliament today that the measure stands and will be introduced on Monday. Knowing her track record the likelihood of it being repealed at the end of the month or even by August is slim. She has another agenda and that is to control immigration. Its too good an opportunity to miss and the timing is linked with her immigration bill. The measure has faced criticism from both within her party and the tourism industry in general, Boris Johnson and others have warmed to the idea of air bridges as a way around it but only time will tell if she will budge on her position. International travel may be off the agenda this summer."
People arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 14 days or face penalties ------------------------------------And what does that mean in practice...if you don't mind paying £1000 then you can ignore the guideline?
"Only 20% of people will be checked, and only in England. The police do not have enforcement powers for this, and the devolved governments have not said even if they'll enforce it, never mind how."
"Groups excluded from the quarantine - though it doesn't mention politicians and their ""assistants"" who might be tempted to use ""instinct"" and act with ""integrity"" to go to the Continent Road haulage and freight workersMedical and care professionals arriving in the UK to provide essential healthcarePatients travelling to the UK to receive pre-arranged medical treatmentTravellers passing through a UK airport, as long as they don't go through border controlAnyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man (the Common Travel Areas)Seasonal farm workers, as long as they self-isolate on the farm.

"I imagine somewhere out there is a parallel universe, where a 14 day quarantine was introduced at the same time as lockdown. I'm sure it was applauded at that time even though it was too late to make any real difference. And in that parallel universe there is a timeline to ease the quarantine as well as the lockdown, and lots of people are saying it's too soon, and there are anomalies, and leave it just a little longer, and the UK will still be here when this is all over."
"She has obviously not taken scientific advice as the Chief Scientific Officer stated “The Sage advice from the experts in this area is that the measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and they’re most effective when they’re applied to countries from higher rates,” he said'|Britain at the moment is the country that has higher rates of infection so the Patel's measure makes no sense. There's another agenda going on here to deflect attention away from what has not yet worked at home such as testing and tracking. Or it could just be that she wants to send a message to the world about not coming to Britain at all. Either way if not repealed quickly will do long term damage to our airlines and travel industry - some of it irreversible."

"It should be clear to everyone, now, as we continue to struggle against this scourge, that the UK Government does, in fact, listen to all the advice from Health & Science Professionals ... and then blatantly ignores it.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Yes but the scientists can't agree amongst themselves . Weeks ago Oxford Uni and Imperial had different viewpoints {and probably still have , given up reading about it now so I wouldn't know}."
You are right. Imperial are still sending out pessimistic messages about us facing significant secondary spikes as lock down is released. They would have us locked up until gone Christmas if they had their way. And it was Imperial that predicted that we would have 10 times the deaths that we are probably going to get.
"@Philip D that is an interesting take. Early on Imperial suggested large numbers of fatalities (100,000's) if we didn't take any action (no lockdown). With the lockdown by April, they revised there estimates into the 10,000's. The IMHE did estimate deaths in the UK around 66,000 by August and 84,000 in the US by August, when they expected the first wave to cease. Even those numbers that looked horrendous in April have been or are near being surpassed and it's only June (if you agree we aren't testing everyone so we should consider excess deaths above a 'normal' year). If we get a second spike, we could easily be looking at 100,000 deaths and over 1 in 1000 UK residents dead. I don't think Imperial gave a pessimistic message. Just my opinion of course."
"Every morning I look at the figures posted by worldometers.info at midnight, GMT. I'm particularly interested in the deaths from the virus per million population in the US, UK, and Can. The figures this morning were: UK - 585 deaths per million; US - 330 deaths; and Canada - 199 deaths. I attribute the much lower figures for Canada to the fact that Prime Minister Trudeau and the provincial premiers (health is a provincial matter) listened to the scientists and imposed lockdowns and social distancing and 2 week quarantines to anyone crossing international or provincial borders by any means, including flying, very early on. And there are hefty fines for anyone breaking these regulations. I think the US and the UK can thank Trump and Johnson for their figures. And lifting lockdowns, opening businesses, etc. while those 2 countries haven't nearly reached the peak is suicidal IMHO.P.S. There are some exceptions to the quarantine rule, e.g. medical personnel who live along the border with the US and work in the US.Edited: 9:07 am, June 04, 2020 "

I wonder if any of the airlines that are reported as thinking of taking legal action against the imposition of the quarantine will do so?
Have read today that Grant Shapps has been tasked with setting up air bridges by the end of the month to holiday hotspots. Its part of a plan to prevent 3 million loosing their jobs. Much of this will depend on whether countries will be willing to enter into such agreements. Our figures are falling and this is cannot be wholly down to the way that the pandemic has been managed here or should we say not managed. There have been a number of announcements made over the past week where logic and good timing seems to have gone out of the window. Maybe these were to deflect attention away form the actions of our Prime Minister Dominic Cummings and how he broke the rules. This one is going to die a slow death over the coming months.

""Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.All other travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of £100, or travellers may be refused entry.If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. There will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed.The government has faced criticism from the aviation industry and some Tory MPs over the measures, but Ms Patel said the measures were ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"".""The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a devastating second wave,"" Ms Patel said.Those arriving in England and Northern Ireland could face a fine of £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a £480 fine in Scotland.

"More ill thought so called policy scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet. Three months too late. The quarantine horse bolted from the Cheltenham Festival and ran amok. A needless piece of window dressing that will reduce an already damaged travel industry to a pile of rubble. Not that many Europeans would probably wish to holiday in the UK at this time. The way the crisis has been handled hasn't gone unnoticed in the rest of Europe. So many flaws in the policy too. Aside all the official exceptions, anyone 'creative' could get around the 14 day quarantine without too much effort. I've spotted at least three. I'm not going to advertise them here for obvious reasons. Had this been enacted in March it would have been sensible. To do it now as the rest of Europe is cautiously opening up is illogical."

Re post #214 << How are people visiting friends in other countries? >> The Netherlands have kept their borders open right from the outset. Anyone arriving at one of the French or Belgian ports appear to have been waved through when informing controllers they are enroute to Holland. Others have been using the Harwich-Hook route due to little or no controls on the Dutch land borders when travelling UK to Germany or vice versa.

"""So yes I imagine you can travel via Northern Ireland to avoid the 14 day quarantine. - how very selfish though. And dont expect a welcome.""Why is that a selfish thought. I don't have the slightest inclination to travel to Ireland. Just pointing out the sheer stupidity of having a quaranteen ban when all that you have to do is hop across the land border IF you were hell bent on avoiding the quaranteen. And don't tell me returning Irish haven't thought of that one."
">>> Also interesting that 2 of the 3 foreign CEOs who think they should be consulted on how the UK defends itself are from Ireland - which is quaranting travellers from UK despite it not happening the other way around. And the 3rd is Swedish, his own country isn't even included in the EU reopening internal borders! <<<=======Because they are employed by their respective companies to the best for them. In this case highlight something that is riddled with inconsistencies and flawed logic which will lead to more job losses."
The loopholes in this scheme are so big that you could drive a fleet of Borismaster London buses through them side by side.
"Am I understanding this right? Because it looks to me like a massive loophole in the Republic of Ireland's scheme, and nothing to do with the UK at all."
"In reading an interview with Fiona Hill she mentioned that 'populist governments are useless at handling complex problems of governance, almost by definition. If leaders are fit to govern, they generally don’t need populism to get elected.'She said '“It’s all about style and swagger and atmospherics, with superficial solutions to things, with lots of sloganeering, and obviously dealing with a pandemic is pretty methodical and boring. It requires an awful lot of planning and logistical organization and you can’t just sort of do it on the fly with an ad hoc coalition.”' With no solid understanding of the situation by some leaders of governments and little interest in dealing with the basics - how to feed, house and keep safe the country's citizens - as well as a rapidly changing pandemic situation, they've flailed about making poor decisions and applying cosmetic tactics in order to be seen to be doing something. Whether the 'it's a war against the virus' approach is worse is debatable, but that is a divisive and nasty tactic that does little to ensure a way through the pandemic process.With that, the quarantine debacle. Poorly planned, difficult to put into practice, and about ten weeks too late. In future this will come under the 'mistakes were made' banner, but who knows if anything will be learned from it."
"Because it looks to me like a massive loophole in the Republic of Ireland's scheme--The Irish scheme requires everyone to fill in the form but if your final destination is Northern Ireland, you only have to fill in a part of it. If you were flying from London to Dublin, and not crossing the border, you'd still have to isolate."
#238 you make a valid point but you at least expect the idiots in control to be able to call on experts but what they completely lack is the ability to make a judgement based on evidense and advice from those experts.And none of this should have come as a surprise to them. They did Project Cygnus only three years ago yet learnt nothing.Thank God the development of a vaccine isn't being left to politicians. Unfortunately the roll out of a vaccination programme will be.
">>> you make a valid point but you at least expect the idiots in control to be able to call on experts but what they completely lack is the ability to make a judgement based on evidense and advice from those experts <<<=======Its clear that Johnson has not got the bandwidth to deal with the current situation. Which has come painfully apparent under Starmer's questioning at PMQs, where he flounders around hoping bluster will get him by, facts and responding to them are clearly not his strong point.History will not judge this Government kindly.Edited: 10:23 am, June 14, 2020 "
True. Watched Starmer ask awkward questions and put to him statements of fact and he gets really riled. Fluster and floundering are not going to help him when faced with someone who was a top line barrister. Boris seems to be loosing touch with reality as does some of his cabinet given the decrees that have come out recently. But Boris isn't really in charge and is only a glove puppet on the hand of his chief advisor.
"I think you're right about Johnson being a puppet. I don't think he ever had a strong enough grip on reality to be a good leader. Now he has been well and truly found out, as have his cabinet of nodding donkeys.Let's make sure that there will never be any statues of this bumbling clown. He can always return to appearing on quiz shows, which seems to be what he does best."

"Its noticeable of late that Johnson has gone into PMQs with preprepared lines and phrases in an effort to try and combat Starmers simple but incisive questioning. The only problem is he gets them mixed up and those he doesn't, he places them out of context, making him look a bigger fool than he is. Any shred of confidence the public had him, was lost when he didn't sack Cummings.This Government has presided over the largest death toll per capita of population from Covid and a significant number of deaths that simply should not have happened had they done their job properly. Yet we are supposed to believe that this 14 day quarantine on those entering the UK is supposed to make a meaningful difference, which as it stands comes across as a Government not wanting to lose face rather than one implementing measures that will make a difference.Edited: 10:37 am, June 14, 2020 "

What measure was introduced yesterday....must be something I've missed.
"Hi Tilly , I thinks it’s letting people go shopping.So we have hundreds of thousands of people queuing , shopping all day everyday in every town and city in England .What would a newly arrived visitor feel as they see that and they have to make their way indoors for 14 days and only allowed out to buy food."
"Thanks, yes the shopping is getting out of hand, not sure what drives people to queue for hours for something probably not essential."
"Just having a quick trawl through what other countries are doing.Two make sense. New Zealand has eradicated the disease and has quarantine. Belgium has the worst death rate in the world and no quarantine. But the rest? Most of Europe is open, but with travellers from certain countries, often including the UK, to be quarantined. Only Greece and Cyprus include Belgium in that list. France is perfectly happy with Belgians, but has a 14 day tit for tat with the UK, which makes about as much sense as Belgium having a 14 day quarantine for New Zealanders. Anyone can fly into Spain, but the land border with Portugal, a much lower infected country, remains closed. We've already seen the nonsense in the RoI where everyone is quarantined except Northern Ireland.The UK government has been rightly criticised, but at least there is a consistency in the scheme. One has to wonder what the reaction is to a lot of these schemes in other countries around the world."
">>> Belgium has the worst death rate in the world and no quarantine <<<======Up until Monday Belguim had closed borders however, it has now opened them to EU states, but the borders are still shut to any where else in the World. During the same period the UK borders have remained open.NZ has half the population of london (with a very different demographic) with the same land area/mass of all the UK and is arguably ideally located to isolate itself.It all goes to show it is nigh on impossible to compare different nations in the current circumstances and nothing can be drawn of the dubious effectivness of this quarantine measure by comparing different countries.Edited: 12:34 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"@254When you start seeing the quarantines as the result of politics - not COVID19 - , it suddenly becomes clear:France and the UK has been at each others throats since well before Margaret Thatcher.

"Yes, the point I was trying to make was that virtually every other country seems to have a policy that is just as inconsistent and badly thought out as ours.

">>> A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced.Unless you happen to be the President of France or a member of his entourage.One rule for the elite and another for the sheep. <<<=====Diplomats and diplomatic visits were top of the list of the many many exclusions. Yes, it brings it all into sharp focus how silly and inconsistant the measure is."
"The French President is being hosted by The Prince Of Wales.He has spent lockdown in Scotland but is now in his London home.We however, cannot commute between our main residence and our holiday home"
"It is a complete farce. The Prince of Wales has a couple of homes and it's ok for him to commute between the two. Did anyone mention that when the Dominic Cummings fiasco was going on ? No , so us lesser mortals can't go to their other homes where they would not be in contact with anyone else . I haven't got a second home but to me the whole thing stinks. And don't get me going about kids not going back to school when it's fine for them to go round Primark! I could go on but that would only make me more annoyed and raise the blood pressure."
And then return first thing the following morning?And repeat day 1 ?
"You could say that it must be good to ease the lockdown gradually and at the same time keep the rules simple. And saying that you can go where you want but you must stay in the same house every night is simple enough. You could also say that the Prince of Wales has travelled to work. But you'd be pushing it.My suspicion would be that not easing up the second home restriction is less about risk, and more about not stirring up again the public resentment that surfaced when lockdown started. They will surely have to abandon restrictions when hotels are allowed to open. You can stay in a hotel, with inevitable risk of contact with others, but you can't stay in your own house?"

The rise in the number is entirely due to an outbreak in an abattoir in the town of Gutersloh. Germany has controlled the virus remarkably well.All nations are going to have localised clusters that is the nature of the beast, I have not looked at Israel and nor am I going too.

@gingergirl if you want to avoid quarantine wait till it has been lifted before you visit
It was never going to work and many said it wouldn't last long. I see this as the first steps in quietly getting rid of quarantine altogether.

Travelireland086As has been said things are likely to change - there may be a travel bridge with Italy by 17 July or Travel from Italy might not be subject to quarantine under the announcement expected next week Under current guidance you would not need to quarantine if you stayed airside but if you enter the UK quarantine applies. Here is an extract from guidance on www.gov.uk. “People transiting airside (individuals who arrive in the UK but do not pass border control)You’ll need to complete the Public Health passenger locator form before you travel to the UK. You will not need to self-isolate for 14 days as you are only transiting via the UK.You will not need to show anything as you will not pass through the UK border.”
"Quotation from the BBC article, link below..https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53199089''But the government spokesman conceded there would be nothing to stop someone avoiding quarantine by flying into a Spanish airport, driving over the border into Portugal for their holiday and returning by the same route.'' As English is not my first language I'd be grateful if anyone could summarize what that exactly means. Does it indicate that it'd be possible to skip quarantine by let's say travelling from Sweden (which will be apparently on the red list) to Norway (green list) and then from Norway to UK without two weeks of self-isolating at home? Has anyone been travelling recently to UK and could write what questions are asked upon arriving? Where exactly did the journey start? etc..I appreciate your advice on that, many thanks.Tom"
"#289 Perhaps if you said exactly what you were thinking of doing more people would give an opinion. For a start, I don't think you can travel from Sweden to Norway."
dewy is correct. You cannot travel from Sweden to Norway anyway because Norway and Denmark have both closed their borders to Sweden. My friend's daughter wants to come home to England but won't fly. She can transit through Denmark but not stop. Anyway we will no doubt hear tomorrow how this traffic light system will work but I'm sure that red countries will be those like the US and Sweden.
"Am I imagining that there used to be a puzzle as to how you got between two stations in Reading by rail, the solution of which involved travelling halfway round the south of England?In a couple of weeks we'll be able to while away the hours of the second lockdown by finding how you can get between two random countries without having to quarantine. England to Scotland might be an interesting one by then. Because air bridges are 100% effective only if both countries have exactly the same requirements as regards every other country in the world, and that's not going to happen."
I never thought this was going to last for long.dewy is 100% right about air bridges.
Re post 294 - not correct as only includes England at present - not rest of UK
"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…The FCO website has released details via the link above, to quote'Coronavirus (COVID-19): countries and territories exempt from advice against ‘all but essential’ international travelThe FCO has updated its global advisory against ‘all but essential’ travel, exempting destinations that no longer pose an unacceptably high risk for British travellers.These exemptions come into effect on 4 July. All our advice will remain under constant review to take into account the latest situation in each country.These countries have been assessed as no longer presenting an unacceptably high risk to British people travelling abroad. Foreign & Commonwealth Office travel advice is based on risks to British nationals, including in-country public health assessments.Note Scotland and Wales are still considering their positions."
In addition see alsohttps:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridorsThis refers to the 10th July date for quarantine rule changes.
"This situation, re-quarantine in the UK, is a mess as Scotland & Wales make decisions at different times than our Westminster Ministers who speak only for England, often, on this issue.We must note that the FCO Govt UK uses the term ""British Travellers,"" on their website, when their advice might only be in respect of English residents. We must be sure and be correct when passing on information in this Forum.Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 3:15 am, July 04, 2020 "
Still the slight difference in Scotland where travellers returning from Spain must quarantine. Wonder how long the difference will last?
The link in my post #298 was updated on the 8th July.Includes advice if you are in self isolation having arrived prior to today and if you stop in a country not on the travel corridors. Seehttps:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors
