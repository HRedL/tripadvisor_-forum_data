"Hi all,We're a family (two adults and two teen kids) travelling to Sicily at the beginning of August. We will spend one week in Mazara del Vallo where we'll stay in self-catering accommodation. We love food and beaches but are also interested in exploring the local culture. Any suggestions for must-see sights?"
"Welcome to Sicily ALNF!Mazara del Vallo is a colourful town, with an historic centre and harbour, full of flavour, intriguing, an Arab influence, local markets, wineries, beaches.....Mazara del Vallo is so worth exploring for its Casbah and the incredible Dancing Satyr.www.visitsicily.info/en/mazara-del-vallo/What's your transport?There are great day trip options from Mazzara del Vallo including Marsala with its cantinas and winery tours, museums with Punic artifacts, and the hydrofoil to the Egadi Islands; Mozia, Selinunte; Sciacca; Eraclea Minoa; Agrigento; the Valley of the Temples, Trapani, Erice, Segesta....VagabondaEdited: 12:03 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Hi Vagabonda,Thank you for responding so quickly and helpfully. We will have a hire car with us for transport, although we'd prefer to avoid long car journeys (1.5 hours max). After Mazara del Vallo, we will proceed to Ragusa (which we have visited many times, although any suggestions for routes from Mazara del Vallo to Ragusa would be welcomed) and then to Ortigia (which we have visited for day trips but we have never stayed there overnight).We are really looking forward to our trip and hope that the flight still goes ahead but we imagine the atmosphere will be quite different this year from previous summers. For example, are masks worn widely in public spaces? How does social distancing work on beaches? Are the guidelines being followed closely or are people quite relaxed?Your suggestions sound great and I'll be sure to look into them further.Thanks,ALNF"
*We'd prefer to avoid long car journeys for day trips/exploration (1.5 hours max).
"Mazara is lovely, and the church full of the Serpotta scupltures is a must see . You can easily go to Selinunte from Mazara, Marsala- often overlooked, salt pans and even Erice ITs easyto fill a week there, and you eat incredibly well - (if you avoid some of the spots on the lungomare!)"
"Hi modicasa,Thanks for your response. It's really interesting and useful. I was surprised to see you do not recommend eating on the lungomare because I know Mazara is renowned for its seafood but at the same time I can imagine that the lungomare spots are dominated by tourists. Where would you recommend for an authentic seafood meal?Thanks,ALNF"
"Drikky's seems a run of the mill pizzeria in Piazza del Plebiscito, but the seafood is amazing with huge portions. And its cheap. In the lanes in town youll find loads of eateries, I found the ones on the lungomare a bit of a letdown. Pretentious and modest offerings. Not all of them, but the ones I tried Id wouldnt go back to."
"Ok, thank you again for such a detailed response! It's really great to know which places to avoid to make sure we make the most of our stay in Mazara. Good, cheap food in large portions sounds perfect :) ! I don't know if any of you have an answer to this question but what route (by car) would you take to get from Mazara del Vallo to Ragusa? We're aware that it's quite a long journey and since we'll be quite unfamiliar with the roads, any guidance would be invaluable.Thanks"
"Hi,Mazara was a wonderful visit for us in 2018.We had a great meal at L'Antica Sicilia: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-â€¦Besides the cathedral and the Museum of the Dancing Satyr, there is a small community theater - Teatro Garibaldi on Via Garibaldi - that gave tours and has an interesting history. Together with walking through the Kasbah and meeting wonderful people (you're in Sicily, after all), we had a great day in Mazara.I hope yours goes well.Joe"
"The easiest way is to follow the SS115 - to Selinunte, Sciacca, Agrigento, LIcata, Gela and on to Ragusa. Its a 4 hour journey, so you can stop off somewhere to break it up a bit. Its a single road, easy to follow. Just hopeyou dont get stuck behind too many lorries because its not good for overtaking.Edited: 9:52 am, July 29, 2020 "
Thanks for all the restaurant recommendations! I noticed in the (excellent) reviews for L'Antica Sicilia that it is near free parking - what is the parking situation in Mazara del Vallo? It seems like there is a wealth of cultural sights on offer which is great to hear. The route suggested sounds very good: simple and direct.Thanks
Are restaurants widely open as usual in Sicily at the moment? I imagine there are restrictions due to Covid-19 but apart from that are most open?
Id say most are open. Most councils have relaxed the rules on outdoor seating to allow the restaurateurs to put more tables outside and reduce the inside space. Those places which dont have outisde space available will find it much harder to open.
"Ok, thank you modicasa. Of course this will cause great difficulty for those restaurants lacking in outdoor space but eating outside is often our preference anyway so hopefully there will be plenty of options to choose from. We're flying to Palermo in the next couple of days and will drive to Mazara del Vallo from there. We're taking a late night flight so will have to navigate the roads in the dark - any tips/suggestions for the route?"
