Do you think it’s safe to travel to Aruba during the Corona Virus epidemic
As safe as walking around at home.
I agree
I just read an article where Aruba has a complete travel ban for people who have recently been to China and Italy. Which is much more strict than the US.
"<< ""Do you think it’s safe to travel to Aruba during the Corona Virus epidemic"" >>Just as safe as relying on the opinions of anonymous strangers on an internet chat-board regarding topics such as infectious diseases, public health, epidemiology, etc.:-)I mean, this is great:8:19pm: Your first-ever post on TA is ""Do you think it’s safe to travel to Aruba during the Corona Virus epidemic?""8:21pm: Reply #1 says ""As safe as walking around at home.""8:21pm: Your second-ever post on TA is ""I agree.""Well... that settles it, then!:-) The internet at its best, folks!"
Is there discrimination on Chinese American Tourists in Aruba due to this Corona Vius?
Do you think maybe you should ask a medical professional rather than people on a travel website?
"<< ""Do you think maybe you should ask a medical professional...?"" >>Their guess is likely to be as good as anyone else's."
yes thank you hemlock
There are no restrictions as per the CDC. No reported cases.
"No, there is no discrimination on Asian looking people due to the Corona virus. We are already passed the stage of the virus being only active in China. There are now more cases outside of China."

"current numbers, by country from this random website. you cannot trust any of the numbers, but.....these are the numbers.That being said, based purely on my opinion, I would multiply the China numbers by 100, then take half of that number and add North Korea. https:/…countries"
"We have been in Aruba for close to two months now- not in a hotel but in a vacation rental suite. During our stay we have not seen people with signs of colds- so no coughing and sneezing individuals, even in crowded supermarkets. The bulk of visitors are from the US, Canada, the Netherlands and also Brazil. Nobody seems to come from the ""high risk"" areas. At this point in time( end of February 2020) I do not perceive a risk to plan a vacation here.Edited: 10:35 am, February 29, 2020 "
"If you’re a healthy person and you get it, you should be fine. Like the flu. Sure it sucks, but you live, But, if you’re like me and are on chemotherapy lowering the immune system, getting this could be a death sentence. The only real problem I foresee is if airports get closed in the U.S. for containment purposes while you are there and you can’t come home for an undetermined amount of time. It could be fun if you can afford it. Most people need to get back to work to pay the bills. So, thats my take,Edited: 11:01 am, February 29, 2020 "

"Not sure, you get cruise ships and people from all ove the world."
"The internet has a lot of great information, but use it as a guide and not the gospel. What happened to your own better judgement? Use your brain. If there are more reported cases every day, what does that tell you?"
"I don’t have any inside scoop. However Aruba does have a significant Chinese population that has been there forever. Whether any people traveled to China during this infectious period is unknown. Also the Aruban gov’t will never do anything to diminish travel to Aruba, tourism is their only real livelihood. My wife and I cancelled a trip during March because she has pre-existing conditions plus our age make us susceptible to virus. Although we viewed the risk of contagion as low we do not believe they would have the capability to deal with the virus if it was contracted"
"Jim S, the stats on Chinese people in relation to the coronavirus is widely available on any Aruban outlet. A total of around 30 Chinese people come into Aruba every month. The Chinese-Aruban residents who have traveled for Chinese new year, have all been back for weeks already, far past the incubation period. One family was put in isolation out of an abundance of caution, but turned out they were not infected. All tourists coming in from Iran, China, South Korea, Italy or Japan are subject to a health inspection upon arrival. The department of health will decide if a case merits isolation or not."
United states will be ban next. But im glade because Aruba is my favorite place to go and Its a small place.
"Actually not true I traveled last week with my boyfriend who is Asian and someone said "" Go back to China""!!! People are stupid also I will add that he was adopted when he was 5 years old from Singapore and had been in the United States since"
"Scheduled to travel to Aruba next week from US. Thinking of cancelling my trip due to this corona virus scare...I just don't want to get stuck there if the situation worsens...although it would be great, I don't think I could afford it...has anyone been there recently that might have an update?"
"What do you want an update on? The situation for Aruba has stayed the same throughout these past weeks/months. No cases and no suspected cases. There is no reason to cancel even if the virus reaches Aruba, which it probably eventually will, just as it has reached St Maarten and other islands. If it reaches the island and you see many cases popping up every day, then you might want to think about canceling. The preparation here has been nothing but world class.If you get quarantined, that bill is not going to you, but the government. https:/…traveler-health-requirementsEdited: 2:36 pm, March 03, 2020 "
the condescending attitude and outright putdown of this Women's request for info begs the question that the internet is a place where people so enjoy putting other people down instead of trying to be helpful. You should use your emotional intelligence and stop being a complete jerk.
"and btw this is why everytime I visit a forum which is rare, I'm sickened by the opportunists looking for a weakness in a question, especially when a woman has questions."
Dah! you must have a case of the stupid virus!
No guarantees anywhere . Just follow the rules of washing hands although I am amazed how many people don’t wash hands regularly anyway !!
"Currently, I’m quite honestly more concerned about stubbing my toe at happy hour on the uneven bricks than I am catching coronavirus in Aruba. Sure, there’s always a chance but..."
"Your reply was not helpful, kind or necessary. The purpose of the forum is to exchange ideas, questions and information about travel. Your post did none of those, and it’s unlikely that anyone cares to read your insults."
I graduate medical school in 2 months. Aruba is fine as of now.
"There is no epidemic. During an average year 56k Americans die from the flu or 153 per day annualized.So, 153 people died from the flu today. The elderly and already health compromised are the folks who are dying from the flu and the coronavirus.Why isn't that an epidemic?In Coronavirus terms take the same rational precautions you would during flu season."
Do you think it is safe to travel to Aruba biplane during the month of April during this Coronavirus
@Deet yes it is safe right now. We are heading to St Lucia next month (Aruba is for February) and we are still planning to go. Pay attention to government warnings and then decide when you get closer to your dates.
"Here's a link with an updated information on Corona Virus & Travel to Aruba: https:/…Edited: 3:47 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"I was just watching the news we have 91 cases and counting in MA, wow do I wish I was someplace warm like Aruba right now. I actually just filled out a survey about being able to teach from home.....its getting real for us here is MA for those that are willing to believe this is serious."
"We cancelled our reservations for our mid-April trip this morning. Not sitting in an airplane for hours with people coughing and sneezing all over the place or hanging around in airports for hours either. Beyond the risk of air travel, you have people pouring into Aruba from all over the world. In addition, there are cruise ship passengers pouring into town every day (and using local taxi's to get around). These would be the same taxi's we would be using as we move around Aruba (such as going out to dinner). Aruba will be there in 2021 and beyond. Why take this risk?"
"Mgiannetto: which airline were you scheduled with and did they work with you on canceling or rescheduling your flight? Change fees? Full refund? Credit for future flight? Just curious. I’m still wavering on what to do for our flight next Friday. My main concern is getting back into the country. Also, My daughters college is now online only until April 14. They also sent an email to students asking those students traveling out of the country to fill out a form giving dates, countries visited and layovers. Is it worth it? I want to say yes for Aruba but still deciding."
This whole thing is downright scary IMO. I am looking into my options as well. I have never canceled a trip and never even thought seriously about it...but I will be making a final decision within the next 24 hours on my upcoming trip that I have already paid for.
"JayD, both my children are testing out connectivity to be able to work from home if need be. They have been able to in the past, but I think the companies they work for want to make sure there are no issues. We have an upcoming trip to Florida at the end of the month, and are not planning on canceling. Each person definitely has to make the decision they feel comfortable with. What's crazy is that 70 of our MA cases were from the Biogen conference."
"Just read a CARPHA article dated 3/6/20 that states ""CARPHA has upgraded the risk of transmission of COVID-19 for the Carribean region to Very High"". Also states ""Another factor is sustained transmission of the disease in countries with direct flights into the Carribean region"". Aruba is obviously one of the CARPHA member states. The WHO also updated the coronavirus to a Pandemic today. Supposed to travel to Aruba on 3/20... ."
"I think that everyone, everywhere, needs to consider exposure to the virus to be a fait accompli.It’s going to be about WHEN you will be exposed... rather than WHERE."
RJP- It would be nice to avoid it as they work on the vaccine.
"JL- You are right about the Biogen stuff, crazy. You are 100 percent correct its all what people feel comfortable with. Most people will continue to do what they had planned and I fully respect that, we are reevaluating all travel plans at this point and will do what what we think is best in the end based on the info we have. I so wish I was just thinking about where we were going to dine, lol."
"Here now.. Business as usual. But, after reading about a spain resort making guest stay 2 weeks since one person at the hotel tested +++.. It could happen anytime. We knew this and were prepared to stay if needed. But with no cases right now in Aruba. Things are good for the time being."
<< “ would be nice to avoid it as they work on the vaccine.” >>Ain’t gonna happen. Time to a vaccine min of 18mo. Well past the point where C-19 will have made one full pass around the planet.Gotta be realistic.
"We are flying on March 20th. We’re going with friends who have no concerns. I have asthma. So, I do have concerns. If we were just going, I’d cancel. I don’t want to leave our friends paying for the AirBNB alone and I guess I’m hoping we can use safety precautions and get home before things really ramp up. Unless the US closes air travel or AirBNB agrees to cover the cancellation fees we’re going to forge on. This could all change tomorrow as updates change so fast. Wishing we would have booked a hotel now so I wouldn’t feel so responsible for backing out of a pricey AirBNB. This is a mess."
"Thanks GoGiants for your positive attitude. Glad you are enjoying Aruba. We arrive on Monday and are looking forward to our trip. We are a tad nervous but will use Purell and antiseptic wipes on the plane as well as in our hotel room. We love Aruba❤️Edited: 8:26 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"I have friends in Europe who will now be staying there for 30 days due to the new banning of flights. A lot could and will happen between now and when are scheduled to travel March 20/26. Now, I’m thinking of what we would do if ALL international travel gets banned? Is anyone else reconsidering who’s traveling in or around when we are?"
"It stinks anyone needs to consider canceling. I love Aruba and know Aruba will be there whenever I do arrive.Edited: 10:42 pm, March 11, 2020 "
We are supposed to fly out 3/20 and return 3/27. We just don’t know what to do.
"We also don’t know what to do. Clearly, this is non essential travel. Do we risk doing and getting stuck or sick? This has gotten real real, real fast!"
We’re supposed to travel to Aruba 3/20-3/27 as well. Spring break trip with our boys. I’m looking into cancellations tomorrow to get information. Not sure if we’re going to pull the trigger yet on it but want to know my options. I would hate to get stuck in a place due to travel restrictions. I know Aruba wouldn’t be a bad place to get stuck but we have work/school we can’t miss. Seriously don’t know what to do right now...
I have read all the precautionary steps Aruba is taking and it is a little reassuring knowing there are no reported cases there. And reading on how the virus does not like temps 77 degrees or higher.
"We are also scheduled for a trip to Aruba leaving this Saturday, March 14th and returning next Saturday, March 21st. We are less concerned about getting the virus but more concerned about being quarantined in our rooms at a resort on an island or if travel is shut down from the Caribbean back to the US. We travel a lot, but this is one trip we are considering cancelling.The reality is that its already everywhere. People are now just panicking and most have not been tested because they have displayed mild symptoms.Still not sure if we will cancel or not. We booked a RedWeek timeshare rental, so it is probably unlikely we would get a refund."
"Honestly...I wonder if anyone's ""cold"" earlier in the year was Covid19. They say the mild cases aren't even identified. It is quite possible you may have had it."
Trip 33 will have to wait for me. I postponed my trip earlier this morning. Its not worth it...I am stressed just thinking about all of the infections in my state- they actually compared MA to Italy in a story I read on Bloomberg News....not reassuring.
"Aruba is the one of the last places people should be worried about ""getting stuck"". In the most extreme situation, charter flights can easily be arranged like has happened in many other countries. The only mitigating factor should be if you have responsibilities you cant get around if you have an ""extended stay"" or if you are in the risk group yourself, you shouldn't be traveling right now. Or if there is a massive outbreak on the island comparable to Italy or other countries. As of now still zero cases. The virus will get here though, its not a matter of if.Edited: 3:32 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I am still looking forward to arriving on Saturday !!! If I end up staying because of all this I cant think of a better place to be stuck!1

The US has almost 590 new cases just today. Please get prepared...this is going to be ugly.
"More cases in the US and the world.But, in spite of that, reading all the posts,....even today, the 14th!! people are considering flying to AUA. Do they not read the news? or the forum?"
Effective today March 16th 2020 Aruba is making all tourist leave and will close down the island until March 31st. I stayed at the Riu Palace Aruba and was already scheduled to leave today. Anyone planning to leave today until the end of the month will not be allowed to enter unless you are a resident
"Your response is just amazing, you made my day"
Who says...china??
Who says...China??
