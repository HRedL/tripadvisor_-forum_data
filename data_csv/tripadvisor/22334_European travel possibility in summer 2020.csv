"In January we planned a trip to Europe from July 3rd that included Ireland, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary. We are just wondering if we should start canceling or there would be still a chance to go?"
Nope. Cancel.
"Don't cancel the air travel now unless the airline has cancelled the flight. If you cancel while the flight is still shown as operating, you probably will not get any refund."
"OK ... just to say ... that Germany has loosened some restrictions, but check me on this, and is getting a second spike of CV19 cases.https:/…explainers-52575313Anthony KEdited: 11:07 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Sorry I did not realize the Paris forum before I posted, forgive me"
"Once France extended its closed boarder and as soon as AirBnb offered full unpenalized cancellations for both renter and hosts we cancelled our trip to France this June. I don’t think we would have enjoyed 14 of our 18 days in self isolation even if we could have gotten in. Another thing that sealed the deal was someone on one of the forums mentioning medical insurance coverage. Would we be covered sufficiently if we came down with the virus while there, and how would we navigate the hospital system especially if we were “uninsured”? (Of course I understand I would be in this same situation if I got hit by a car...need to check into it!)"
UK to France & home ... early September 2020 ... pour moi ... possible.Anthony K
"welcome,as mentioned wait for the airlines to do something first. They will probably give you options.you can look at your lodging fine print and see if it makes a difference to cancel now, later or ?If you still want to go, you may want to think ""flexible"". You may or may not be able to hit all of the places you want. Depending on the virus and whats found/discovered, some places may have mandatory quarantines or may not allow entry at all. SO, you may want to ponder all of the possibilities that maybe thrown at you from various countries and what you will want to do.Then also consider all of the fallout from this bug. People loosing jobs, businesses closing and so forth. Hotels may close, restaurants may close too. So things you may want to see maybe changed or places you have planned to stay maybe closed. You may also want to be aware, this is not over at this date/time. ALso, if this ends up being like the flu that comes around every year, what do you think will happen?good luck"
"""If you still want to go, you may want to think ""flexible"". You may or may not be able to hit all of the places you want.""Or any of them since the Schengen zone is unlikely to reopen to non-residents before September at the earliest."
