"Even there are vaccines, proving their efficacy is a different story.https:/…Some are already in Phase 3.https:/…I don't think you can expect to prove their safety and efficacy within eight months or so.Many Japanese say that would be impossible before the Olympics.There are some medical experts here, so could you tell us how long does it take to consider vaccines efficacy and effectiveness in general?Edited: 10:55 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"I don't have any medical qualifications, but there's an interview with Anthony Fauci, our national hero, at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GEloEbIsdg that may answer part of your question. The interview starts at 3 minutes and 25 seconds. (If anyone has difficulty understanding his New York accent, the captioning function (cc button) on YouTube works well.)"
"Thank you so much for telling me about the video, Bargainhunter. The vaccine part started around 8:11.Dr. Fauci uses plain English, so it was quite easy to understand.I didn't even notice the difference between New York accent and General American accent even I noticed a lady from New Jersey had a kind of Southern drawl even she was a New Jersey native which surprised me then. It is true that some states are doing excellent in controlling it like Vermont, Maine and Wyoming.It was quite interesting that American Football question came up.Japan opened bars and restaurants and some clusters are reported these days. Tokyo Governor made request them to close at 10 p.m.We started contact sports like Sumo with having PCR tests done before the tournament and Abi, a wrestler who went out to cabarets, was suspended from joining tournaments. Some soccer players are testing positive and some teams need to cancel their games due to it.Let's see if vaccines will start to decrease the numbers or not. I would prefer to take the precaution measurements than challenging to take the vaccines in the initial stage.Edited: 7:18 am, August 14, 2020 "
"The point of the vaccine that Dr.　Fauci　mentioned　is　that　there　might　be　a　safe　one　introduced　by the end of year or around the beginning of January. He only mentions it must be vaccinated to all races to prove it works for every group but doesn't mention how long it will take to prove their effectiveness just denying it won't be 2024 as other expert is predicting.I don't think a month or so will be enough to prove their efficacy. It will take a few months at least to distribute the vaccines itself. It will be a miracle if the 2.4 million, which might be 3 million soon, numbers come down to less than 10 thousand by next spring. Of course it is up to you if you believe in miracles or not. China got the numbers down but they could make that happen with strong control and will, not naturally."
