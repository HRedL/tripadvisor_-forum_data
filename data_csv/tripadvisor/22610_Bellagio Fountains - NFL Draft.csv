"Does anybody know if the construction of the stage for the NFL Draft red carpet will affect the fountain show at Bellagio? Not sure if they would still be going off as normal, or if they will be reduced or cancelled altogether while the stage is up."
Probably a better chance things get cancelled due to the coronavirus.
"Ha, it'd be great if when Roger Goodell is on stage saying, ""And the first pick of the NFL Draft is..."" and the fountains go off, drenching him.Can't imagine they'll be on in any major capacity considering all the electrical equipment involved.Besides, if they still hold it, it'll be an absolute mob scene there anyways."
