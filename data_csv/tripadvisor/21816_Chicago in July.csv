"Traveling to move my daughter to Chicago in July. No itinerary since we realize many restaurants and attractions will be closed, but still hope a few things might open by then! Will definitely need some food delivery suggestions for the first couple of days if restaurants are not open! The new place is in Noble Square/West Town area. Thanks for suggestions."

Here is an extensive list of restaurants.... some of Chicago's best offering food to go.https://www.exploretock.comB.
"Restaurant are reopening, it seems like one-by-one. By July, we hope to be in phase 4, allowing indoor dining, so places that don't have any outdoor dining space will be able to reopen. If they are open for carry-out/delivery or indoor dining, consider Funkenhausen, German food with a southern accent, Sounds weird but it works."
"""By July, we hope to be in phase 4, allowing indoor dining, so places that don't have any outdoor dining space will be able to reopen. ""Seems like there are spikes in many states at the time you think Illinois will start to implement restrictions again?"
"JB, Illinois new cases, new hospitalizations, and deaths are going down. Based on that trend and the metrics that have been announced for entering Phase 4 (which track CDC guidance), we are well on track to do so . But, of course, there may be an uptick in new cases as a result of the BLM protests, which began over Memorial Day weekend. Most protesters were wearing masks, but of course they were standing closer than 6' apart. The states that are spiking are predominantly those that ""opened up"" completely in early or mid-May , despite a failure to meet CDC guidelines for doing so and where mask-wearing is viewed by large numbers of the public as some sort of effete liberal conspiracy (e.g., AZ, TX, and FL).Edited: 2:56 pm, June 15, 2020 "
Ok thanks for the update!
Like MBA says if we can continue to stay the course phase 4 is not far away. The state and the city are doing an excellent job of monitoring. Our testing is good which helps tremendously. Unfortunately there are a fair amount of states that have figured out they opened up too early (looking at you Texas) and will probably have to (or at a least should) shut down. Hopefully that doesn't effect us as we have worked hard.B.
"It's official that indoor restaurant dining will be permitted as of next Friday, June 26 in Chicago (and the rest of the State). Density restrictions: (a) prohibit more than 25% occupancy; (b) prohibit more than 50 people in any room; and (c) no more than 10 people at any table, with 6 foot spacing between tables."

Restaurants hate grubhub. Their fees are unreasonable. Sometimes they make more profit than the actual restaurant on an order. Not saying you can't use them to find a place to eat but use another service to order or go pick up.B.
If restaurants hate Grubhub then they should sign up with a different service or do their own delivery. They have options so why do they keep signing up with them? For a lot of places if you want to do online order the only option they offer is Grubhub.
