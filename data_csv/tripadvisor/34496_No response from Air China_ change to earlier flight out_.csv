"Hi, we've called Air China multiple times and they never answered the phone (US number) - currently stuck in the province that directly borders Hubei (where Wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak is situated) to the north and are concerned about 1) the risk of the outbreak spreading here, 2) that CGO or PEK will go into lockdown as Wuhan has and that we'd be stuck here indefinitely.Anybody knows how to get a hold of Air China? I've read that China Southern has offered free refunds/changes to international flights in/out/passing through China but what about Air China?Edited: 7:11 pm, January 27, 2020 "
"Go talk to them directly, either at their office of at the airport."

"You can say that you're in Henan. Presumably in Zhengzhou or Luoyang. But why are you in China trying to call an Air China USA number? Go to an in-town or CGO Air China ticket office and sort out an earlier flight date. This is the kind of thing best sorted face-to-face. In-town offices may still be closed for the holiday. If you were departing internationally from Beijing, it is unlikely that they will shut PEK.Edited: 9:20 pm, January 27, 2020 "
