"When the government says that out-of-state visitors (outside of the exceptions like CT, VT, etc.) must ""Quarantine"" for 14 days what exactly does that entail? Must a visitor stay in their lodging and not go out at all? Or can they go to the grocery store? Can they go for a walk or a swim in the ocean?The WHO advises against travel restrictions so why this quarantine exists is a mystery. More people need to know this fact.Edited: 8:04 pm, July 01, 2020 "
Can you provide us with a link where WHO says that?
"Lisa, read Dina's post ""Last Minute Travel Advice"" as your question has been fully answered there. Currently that post is right under yours."
"I do not wish to link because there may be legalities doing that. You can easily find the information on the WHO website doing a search ""who"" +""travel restrictions"". Scroll down and it clearly states it ""advises against"" travel restrictions and they are ineffective and may cause social disruption."
Phase 3 may be on track to occur on July 6. This article indicates what will open. I notice that there is no mention of quarantine which changed to 'urged' on June 8 and is not being enforced in any manner.https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/06…
I don't see where it goes into detail about what a quarantine entails. Where is this information? I had looked at the state website and could not find it.
There is nothing illegal about posting a link. Reading what you are asking about is the only way to get an answer to your question.In Mass. quarantine means that people are urged not to go out at all for 14-days. It's pretty straightforward..
"Here's what the CDC says about travel: https:/…travel-in-the-us.htmlAnd note that U.S. residents are banned from traveling to the EU at this time because of the surging number of cases. Also Canada closed its borders to us as well.Edited: 9:28 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Quarantine means you don't leave your accommodations. Period. Seeking medical care is the exception.Once you enter Massachusetts from a state not exempt from quarantine you are expected to do so. You are being urged to do this without enforcement, though I wonder whether that might change at some point. Just because places are open for business doesn't mean you flock to them. Ask Florida, Texas & Arizona."
"Thanks. But Florida, Texas and Arizona are they way they are not because people flocked there; it's because they didn't wear masks and social distance. That appears to be the solution to keep the virus at a very manageable level.Travelers must stay in for 14 days, exception is medical care? Didn't the US revolution start in Massachusetts?Edited: 10:55 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Are you an attorney? It certainly can be illegal to link. I said ""could"". Why take chances? Better yet why violate someone else's rights? And the travel quarantine is anything but straightforward. I could not find anything on the state website. I will say I didn't look in depth. You would think that an order of that magnitude (that may or may not violate people's rights) would be posted prominently. If you think I may have an issue with the order the only reason I do is because the WHO advises against travel restrictions and the fact that the citizens pay into the WHO and because the government replies on the WHO for the best medical advice. I mean, what's going on? No one seems to know. It's right there on the WHO website.Edited: 11:05 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"If citizens pay into the WHO then why can't you, as a citizen, post the specific information you are referring to?"
"It is probably ok to link to the WHO website. But I don't want to take any chance given that anyone who wants to know about what the WHO's position is can simply find it in seconds themselves through a search. Did you know if you have a website and it's accessible to certain jurisdictions, like California or the European Union, you legally MUST provide a privacy statement? Did you know you can send an unsolicited email to anyone, and that is perfectly legal in the US? As long as you follow a number of requirements it's no problem to send it one time. But certain states have more stringent laws on email. Alas, federal law trumps state law. My point is law is very complex, very fact dependent and me personally? I like to not violate anyone else's rights so I will not take any risks linking.Edited: 1:11 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Wow. You are concerned about legalities of links but it's ok for you to justify your intention & travel to a state where their government decided they rather you wouldn't.That kind of thinking is exactly why I worry about my lifelong friends on the Cape.Please travel in your own backyard, close to home."
"""Their government"" didn't decide they would rather out-of-state people not travel; they want those people to quarantine for 14 days. I would fulyl understand and respect that but why do they have that order when the WHO and other epidemiologist all over the world state that travel restrictions and not advised? Travel restrictions they have discovered are ineffective and can do harm to society. I would more concerned for your lifelong friends on the Cape from sharks then I would from out-of-state tourists. Actually I would be more concerned for their waistlines from eating all that ice cream.Edited: 1:10 am, July 03, 2020 "
"You as a poster here can link to anything you want.If it is a link to something illegal your post can be removed. You will suffer zero consequences.Your roundabout statements and obfuscations are obvious moves to avoid the truth. The truth is the WHO doesn't say that, the WHO isn't Law, and the rules of the state are what matters. Florida was stopping cars on the interstate. Maine is requiring an affidavit. NY/NJ/CT are requiring strict quarantines on many states. And Mass has their rules.If you don't want to follow them, don't come. But don't try to skirt the issue by claiming nonexistent laws make it impossible to post your links that refute the Commonwealth's instructions"
"""If you think I may have an issue with the order the only reason I do is because the WHO advises against travel restrictions""Well first of all there are not travel restrictions between US States.I will have to give you credit for one thing. The WHO did say essentially what you claim they did. At the risk of being arrested I will post that link: https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detai…If you have a problem with travel restrictions your problem is with close to the entire planet not Mass.https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictionsIf you have questions ask away and people will do their best to answer.

"Hank, did Lisa say she would be coming to MA from an International location? Your links are for international travel.BTW, I was disappointed to hear that two airlines are beginning service to/from China again. One was United to ShangHai"
The word quarantine literally means “isolation”So no you cannot leave your accommodations for 14 days.There are places all around the world you are free to visit without being asked to quarantine.
"Please don't come to Mass. I don't think anybody wants you here especially with your comment about waistlines of people on Cape Cod. Nice going.If you still end up coming, you better be wearing a mask and sanitizing properly as is required by law in MA."
"""Hank, did Lisa say she would be coming to MA from an International location? Your links are for international travel""You totally missed the context.She has an issue with Mass travel restriction orders in light of the WHO not supporting travel restrictions (despite the fact that Mass does not have travel restrictions between the States).And I pointed out that if her problem is with not conforming to the WHO's opinion on travel restrictions then the problem is with close to every country on the planet not Mass in particular.The W stands for World not States and I was responding to someone having an issue with not heading the WHOs opinion and I pointed out that would be the World not Mass.Edited: 10:42 am, July 02, 2020 "
"So now this is a worldwide philosophical discussion? Why don't we just follow the MA guidelines and leave it at that?Visitors have enough input by now to make a decision on their own. And note too that hotels where they had planned to stay will not allow refunds since, by law, they can rent to anyone from any state for any length of time. No wonder these folks are confused."
"""Why don't we just follow the MA guidelines and leave it at that?""You to me. That's pretty much the point of several responses to someone siting WHO opinion. You missed the point again."
Business owners have spent so much time and money into all the updates and rules needed to finally reopen. They to might not agree with these restrictions and new procedures in place but...they will lose their business and income if the state decides to close again due to out of state visitors not following recommended self quarantine. If people can’t respect that than stay home. It’s not fair to jeopardize businesses because we don’t agree with the rules.

"""If it is a link to something illegal your post can be removed. You will suffer zero consequences.""There is a misunderstanding here. I did not say anything about linking to something illegal. I said linking to something, anything, might be illegal or a civil wrong like copyright infringement. For example, if you link to a webpage that contains a photo (which is copyrighted) may be considered copyright infringement. Linking to libel may subject one to libel laws of a particular jurisdiction (which may be anywhere in the world). I said ""may"". Law is very complex and internet law in particular is evolving fast. Do a simple search on linking and law and you will see.Edited: 8:38 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"""But just posting to give Mass the finger isn't going to accomplish anything.""I'm not giving Mass the finger at all. I lived outside of Boston as a kid and it was wonderful. I vacationed at the Cape and Berkshires. I would have issue with the cold and snow now but I still like New England, the culture, the people, the architecture, the land and food."
"I think this thread has achieved its purpose. You asked what quarantine entails, you received an answer, and were also informed that quarantine is not being strictly enforced by the state. Shall we move on?"
"You are expected to follow the same guidelines that apply to MA residents who return to the state. Here they are: https:/…safer-at-home-advisoryEdited: 2:31 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Quarantine means you don't go out. Not to the store, not for a walk, not for anything. Massachusetts does not currently ask you to quarantine.WHO has nothing to do with it. At all. It is the Commonwealth of Mass.Edited: 2:57 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Massachusetts ENCOURAGE you to Quarantine, depending on where you are coming from"
"I gave some incorrect info above. Only a few states' residents are exempt from the qurantine guideline. Here is what the state says:All travelers arriving to Massachusetts – including Massachusetts residents returning home – are instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days, except that, beginning July 1, 2020, travelers from Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, and New Jersey arriving in Massachusetts are exempt from this directive and need not self-quarantine for 14 days. In addition, workers designated by the federal government as essential critical infrastructure workers are exempt from the directive to self-quarantine for 14 days if traveling to Massachusetts for work purposes. All persons are instructed not to travel to Massachusetts if they are displaying symptoms of COVID-19."
Thank CT for clarifying.
"yup, I'm planning to do it upon return home from Idaho in August, assuming the going to Idaho part of the equation will still be okay then.Got 2 1000 piece puzzle and a few books lined up already."
"The WHO information I was able to find is quite dated and is really talking about international travel bans. They say that “tavellers returning from affected areas should self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days and follow national protocols of receiving countries. Some countries may require returning travellers to enter quarantine.” So, WHO is advising that if you come into Massachusetts from a hot-spot state you should follow Massachusetts rules and quarantine.https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detai…"
"That is information from February and should still be valid as I can't imagine an organization with such authority not revising important information on their website. If you read closely it says ""affected areas"" of ongoing transmission which included not just countries but all areas of the world. Then it states ""Travellers returning from affected areas"". It does not say travelers from affected areas, only ""returning"" travelers. So not only are countries and areas going against the advise for travel restrictions they are going against the quarantine advises as well. If it was simply for all travelers from an affected area they would not just indicated returning travelers. Right? Or they did not explain well enough? Personally, I would not travel to an area with high infection. But if I lived in an area of low infection I would not mind travelers from high infection areas to enter without quarantine. This is because the virus is already in the community. Now if I was ion an island without any cases I would full support a travel ban and quarantine for residents returning.Edited: 11:34 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"This whole conversation on skirting our rules and their intents is very irritating. We were one of the first infected areas of the country with Covid and have worked hard to reduce its impact here. The last thing in the world we want is to bring folks from now-more-highly-infected areas to start the virus back up by going around our ""new norms"".

"As a local resident of MA, I truly hope that anyone from a current hotspot please reconsider coming here now. The state and its residents have really suffered the last few months to get us where we are now. If you're going to come here, and ESPECIALLY if you're going to try to skirt the quarantine, that's really unfair to us. I don't care which hotspot it is, I'm blind to geography, but I really don't think it's wise to infect a population that has really bitten the bullet to get us to the lowest infection rate we've been at since this started. Please put your own selfishness aside."
