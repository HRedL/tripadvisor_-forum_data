"Hi, we'll be spending 10 days from Minneapolis to Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. What are the best campground with pop up for sights, hikes, and central to general touring. We are an active family, enjoy hiking, raft, horseback ride, experience the western vibe."
When do you plan to travel? Do you have 10 days for the parks or 10 days round trip from home and back?
We have 10 days total; thinking 3 days @ each park? Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!
We are travelling latter August---will campgrounds be open per norm due to Covid-19 situation?
Everything is uncertain yet. Don't make any non-refundable reservations. Do you know how you plan to arrive to the parks?
"Thank you Deb, love all of the info. What are your thoughts on Grant Village, staying around S. entrance?"
"Here are the camping options in the Tetons -https://www.gtlc.com/campingMost are FCFS but you can book at Headwaters at Flagg Ranch. Normally I discourage that location because although it's between GTNP and YNP it's still a drive to both/ either. But given that YNP is (probably) not opening their lodges this summer, finding a spot in Yellowtone may be even more difficult than usual. Headwaters COULD be a base for Yellowstone, although there's a lot of driving in Yellowstone. It could be an option if you can't get a camping spot in YNP and you can book ahead.The three FCFS campgrounds in GTNP are ALL lovely. But, in my opinion, Gros Ventre is in one of th prettiest places I've ever seen. Smack dab in the prettiest part of the park, near Moose WY and there WILL be moose in the campground, especially in mornings and afternoons. There will probably be pronghorn nearby. As you drive out of the campground, you'll have full on views of the Tetons. Great food options nearby at Dornan's at Moose. Limited services and you'd have to go to another campground for showers. That may not work for you. In normal years, it usually doesn't fill up except around July 4th, but who knows this year?Check out the park website to see what your options are. For Yellowstone, you may want to check out private camping options to see if you can reserve something to know you'll have a camping spot."
">>>Thank you Deb, love all of the info. What are your thoughts on Grant Village, staying around S. entrance?<<<You're welcome. Glad that I was of help. : )I've never stayed at Grant Village Campground before, but wouldn't hesitate to do so for doing ""typical tourist touring"" of the lower loop. The reason I don't use it is we like to do a lot of wildlife watching on our trips, so it's important for us to be closer to Hayden Valley for early morning and late evening prime wildlife watching times. The nice thing about Grant Campground is it has showers and laundry facilities on site. The only other campground in Yellowstone Park that has showers/laundry is Canyon Campground. I would not want to stay at Grant Village Campground for my entire stay at Yellowstone Park, as I don't prefer long drives from one end of the park to the other end just to tour. I like being more centrally located or at least, split my stay between too areas even if it means I lose a little time breaking down/setting up camp.Are you planning on doing Yellowstone or Grand Teton first?

"""We are travelling latter August""My September experience may or may not be valid, but on our September trips we've had great elk photo opps all the way from Lake to West Thumb Geyser Basin (near Grant). Every September trip has brought great memories - a bull trying to round up his harem, with the lake in the background. The late afternoon light and the lake behind him made for some of the prettiest photos I've ever taken. It's just amazing to listen to the bugling and he paced back and forth because his girls were NOT the least bit interested in being rounded up. On the last trip, he (or another like him) was up the road but in the burned forest. Hard to see him but easy to hear him. And then my favorite day in the park when the elk were IN the geothermal features at WTGB, grazing, bugling and one with only his butt sticking out of the geothermal. Other than the exciting black bear sightings each year between Tower and Mammoth, the elk activity in the south are my favorite wildlife memories of the park. One day we were driving "" too late"" because the rangers had closed the south gate to a terrible car accident. Just as dusk was shifting to dark, there was a huge bull elk in a pullout, posing. Car after car got a gorgeous photo of him in full pose, highlighted by headlights. Another years, cars pulled over to watch a big bull elk graze...and then he starts trotting up toward the road to cross the road. Rangers were there, monitoring of course, but it was a wondrous experience to be (unintentionally) that close. When I plan September visit, I plan in my ""extra time"" for the stretch between Lake and West Thumb for elk watching. So far, I'm batting 1000. Again, not sure if there will be that much activity in late August."
