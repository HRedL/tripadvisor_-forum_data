"Oh boy, you just can't help some ppl.For goodness sake, delete your post OP.We are not Travelgenio and can't do anything for your problem with the shonky booking agent you used."
File a complaint with your credit card provider. See if they can help you get your money back.
I'm not sure- HAS anyone else had a problem with Travelgenio? Have you checked?
Skim this board. You gave your money to possibly the worst company out there.Did you do any research before you chose them?
"I have the same issue with Travelgenio. I've sent them multiple emails for ore than a month now. Unfortunately, I never receive a reply. I disputed the charge from my bank but they needed a void memo for the amount to be reimbursed. Travelgenio is the worst! they can't even provide me with the void memo.Edited: 2:12 am, March 25, 2020 "
>>> has anyone else had a similar expenence with travelgenio <<<Hundreds. You could all get together and have a worldwide convention. Organise your own flights though.

The notice was confirmed. But we are past the scheduled date of our trip. I hope you can settle this reservation quickly.
It’s great to see that travelers are communicating with Travelgenio via Trip Advisor. Seems to be working. Very innovative.

"Can you see it on every thread I’ve put it on? Can’t say I’m a tripadvisor expert, just wanted to give people a bit of hope that’s all"
"No, Talia, nobody can see your multiple posts because all but one have been removed.That's what happens when you post the same thing on lots of threads."
"In fact, it could be considered fortunate that they all haven't disappeared.It's a learning curve for new contributors, but posting once really is enough."
