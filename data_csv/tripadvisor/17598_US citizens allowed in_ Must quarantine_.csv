"I am considering a holiday in London in the next two weeks. It appears US citizens are allowed in but what's not clear is if there is a quarantine? Is there? If so what does it entail? Can one go to the supermarket or restaurant to get a take-away? Or must they stay in their room for 14 days? If the hotel serves breakfast can they go into the breakfast room?Edited: 9:11 pm, July 16, 2020 "
"Personally, I wouldn't even think about doing that. Americans have been taking advantage of that quarantine loophole in Ireland, causing a lot of unhappiness among Irish restaurateurs, innkeepers, their employees and others who worked hard, and at great cost, to get virus under control, only to feel threatened anew by Americans who ""need a break"" ignoring their loosely enforced quarantine rules. Some have taken matters into their own hands, refusing to book or serve foreigners who can't prove they have been in Ireland for 14 days, or simply turning away people who don't have Irish accents. People are pressuring Irish govt to adopt rules like most of rest of EU, simply closing borders to Americans.I have no idea how Brits are dealing with this, or whether their govt enforces their rules, but the Irish problems have been getting a lot of press both in Ireland and US."
"What quarantine loophole? Either US citizens are legally allowed to enter the England or not. The fact that the population in a country doesn't understand the science is not my concern - all epidemiologists know that travel restrictions are not effective and are not advised. In fact Dr. Fauci just said recently on national television that he was not happy with the travel restrictions between the US and the EU.  Now, following the local authorities on quarantine is something I think everyone should do. So I'm asking ""Are US Citizens allowed to enter England and if so what if any quarantine and what exactly does that entail? Thanks for the info on Ireland but that's not what I was about.Edited: 12:34 am, July 17, 2020 "
You are to go direct from the airport to a place of self isolation. You should not leave it for 14 days. See the official government statement at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…
Thank you. With a 2 week mandatory highly restrictive quarantine it doesn't make sense for me to travel there.
"'What quarantine loophole?' That which has been under discussion here and elsewhere for about a month, although now a moot point.'The fact that the population in a country doesn't understand the science is not my concern - all epidemiologists know that travel restrictions are not effective and are not advised.' Dear oh dearie me. I'd like to see a list of the epidemiologists who 'know that travel restrictions are not effective and are not advised'."
"'What quarantine loophole?A loophole is where there is ambiguity where people can take advantage to their benefit. The fact that England is allowing US citizens to enter is not an ambiguity.List of epidemiologists? It's common knowledge in the field. Search in a search engine for excellent articles in foreignpolicy and the economist. Search ""travel restrictions"" ""ineffective"" ""who"". You'll see them. They go in detail about why governments implement travel restrictions. And it isn't good for citizens. Then search Dr. Fuaci and travel restrictions. There is a recent video of him talking about it.Edited: 1:15 am, July 17, 2020 "
"“ With a 2 week mandatory highly restrictive quarantine it doesn't make sense for me to travel there.”Correct!....... that is one intent of the policy, to dissuade travel from countries with serious and widespread infection. There are countries from where travellers are not required to self-isolate - the USA is not one of those."
"""that is one intent of the policy, to dissuade travel""Then why didn't they just not allow travel like the EU did? Doesn't make sense. What makes sense is that they want to prevent more virus coming in. But what they don't know is that it doesn't matter if virus comes in because it's already in the country. That's why travel restrictions are ineffective. Read the articles and report back."
"“ With a 2 week mandatory highly restrictive quarantine it doesn't make sense for me to travel there.”Good, stay in USA. Travel is a privilege not a right. In these difficult times take responsibility for not spreading this virus and don’t travel. The arrogance of travellers To Ireland who think they don’t have to comply with the rules is awful.You live a huge country, if you want to travel then stay there. With the Awful reported situation in USA regarding infection rates I’m not surprised that US travellers are treated with suspicion."
"""Travel is a privilege not a right.""Not true! Travel is a right protected by law, A good place to start on the subject are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. You didn't read any of the articles I cited. There you can see that travel restrictions do not do anything to make the virus situation better. In fact it can make other things worse! I know it' difficult for most people to believe but it's true!  I won't travel there because there is a quarantine and that is something I believe people should follow. I could travel there and quarantine for 14 days. Then would I be welcome? Sounds like I would not. So there you go!Edited: 2:23 am, July 17, 2020 "
""" I could travel there and quarantine for 14 days. Then would I be welcome? Sounds like I would not.""People who follow the rules are welcome. Currently that means visitors from the USA must quarantine for 14 days. That may change."
USA sets a world record of 70000 new infections in one day.Travel restrictions don’t work???If people didn’t travel so much it wouldn’t spread so much.If people didn’t crowd together so much it wouldn’t spread so much
"I think there's likely many reasons why both the British and Irish governments have different rules for Americans, or people traveling from America, than most of the EU. Many British and Irish people are residents of the US, some have American spouses and/or American children, some have actually become American citizens themselves and most of them probably still have family in Britain/Ireland and possible need to travel there, Likewise, there are Americans resident in Britain in similar situations. Not to mention the long-standing ""special relationships"" between both countries and the US (likely now frayed). I can only assume this quarantine rule was created more with these situations in mind, and not for people like you. We are having similar problems in NYC. People from infected places like Florida, Texas, Arizona et al coming here because they need ""a break."" We have a 14 day quarantine too, but it is practically unenforceable and since we don't have borders there's nothing much more we can do to keep other Americans out. And if what the experts now say is true, our ""second wave"" may not be in the fall but next month, thanks to these thoughtless people.Edited: 2:49 am, July 17, 2020 "
"'Travel is a right protected by law,' Nope. 'A good place to start on the subject are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' If you're referencing Article 13 of the UDHR then have you not noticed that there's a pandemic causing problems across the world?If you've referenced Article 12 of the ICCPR then I suggest you re-read 12.3 with regard to public health.'There you can see that travel restrictions do not do anything to make the virus situation better. In fact it can make other things worse!' The stark differences in the pandemic numbers between Canada and the USA with the land border currently closed and self-quarantine measures in place in Canada since March are evidence that those statements are not necessarily correct."

"It doesn't then make travel not a right. It is a right no matter what. Governments can however take actions to restrict travel when certain conditions warrant. Law is highly complex so it's not readily apparent if rights are being violated or not right now, depending on exactly what's being implemented. In the US some people and states have started legal actions against states for such potential travel restriction violations. ""The stark differences in the pandemic numbers between Canada and the USA with the land border currently closed and self-quarantine measures in place in Canada since March are evidence that those statements are not necessarily correct.""That stark difference is not because of travel restrictions it's because they opened too soon and too fast and people did not practice social distancing and wearing masks.

""" thanks to these thoughtless people.""The thoughtless people are not the ones who travel there. It's the people who do not social distance and wear masks where required. As stated by medical authorities, travel restrictions are ineffective and not advised."
"It’s all those things It’s not about picking the ones that suit you and disregarding others Stay indoors Stay away from other people Don’t travel around unnecessarilyWork from home if possibleAvoid public transport Avoid crowds Maintain social distancing Wash hands regularly Limit number of visitors to your home Wear a face mask to stop it spreading All of these are good practice whether the government guidance has changed to suit the mood of the dayTravel restrictions are not ineffectiveEdited: 3:24 am, July 17, 2020 "
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…If you were to be self isolating in an hotel you would basically have to stay in your room for the duration of the quarantine. You would not be able to visit the restaurant or go to the shops. Hotels may be able to provide spaces for isolated exercise. Not ideal for visitors from countries currently not on the exempt list.
"So if travel itself has not caused the spread of the virus, how come it’s spread around the whole world? In your case the virus should have been contained in China. In Europe alone we know that many cases can be traced to those who travelled to Italy, many for ski holidays.Restricting travel during lockdown worked in helping stop the spread. You only have to look at European countries where now infection rates are very low. That’s certainly not happening in US where it seems to be a free for all, do anything you want.Too many bleat about their rights but we also have responsibilities in exercising those rights. In these difficult times I’m prepared to forego manyof those rights and be responsible for my actions. I’ll wear a mask, I’ll not travel especially abroad, I’ll limit the people I’ll see, I’ll practice social distancing and hygiene. I’ll put much of life on hold for the time being. I’ll not bleat my rights are being infringed.I’m just amazed the OP even thought of coming to London. Spending a lot of money on a 2nd rate holiday. After quarantine having to wear a mask for much of the time, practice social distancing, having to book tickets to see attractions, booking restaurants, doesn’t seem a relaxing holiday. I wonder how much research was done about respecting our rules?"
"OP, give it up. With every post you seem to want to demonstrate more and more arrogance towards and lack of care about others. That may not be your intention, but surely you understand that we should all do our best to prevent the spread of the virus. And that includes you. Play your part by not trying to argue about rules you cannot change. Stay at home until you can enjoy a holiday free of current restrictions. As to “travel is a right protected by law”, try that in North Korea."
"I would suggest that the fact that all the Countries that closed their borders to all except returning nationals and strict lockdown measures have experienced much lower infection and fatality rates than those that did not says that they *do* work regardless of what so-called ""experts"" say. As the US routinely ignores the UDHR and the ICCPR makes it rather ironic that one of it's citizens is now citing those Conventions to attempt to justify thheir irresponsible attitude to travel during a pandemic."
"WendtrFirstly welcome to the forum as I note that you have just joined, presumably to ask your question.Taking in to consideration the recent spread of the infection in your country and the tone of your posts may I respectfully request that you stay away.You would and should quarantine if you arrived here but also considering the way people are getting infected in the USA if you did not have the virus when you boarded the plane you could have it when you landed.Please do consider visiting our shores in the future when the virus is history but in the meantime do have a nice day"
"You’re a lot more welcoming than I would be, Ashtonian."
"Incidentally, the restrictions in the UK have nothing to do with Citizenship, it's the place you're arriving from. If I, as a British Citizen came home from the US, I would have to self isolate for 14 days as well.This rather pathetic, immature whine from Americans that ""we're being picked on because we're American"" is starting to grate now."

I figured that someone here would give the correct answer and they in fact did. I didn't consider anyone here numpties. I got the right information I was looking for and I shared some good information. Then some people got the wrong idea of me or are wrong about the up to date science on virology. Really, the information I shared is part of the reason why the world can go in a positive direction. Many authorities lie, mislead and omit. There's no reason why this has to be. None. I'm not some political nut or anything like that. I'm just sharing good information."
"“Many authorities lie, mislead and omit.”Yep how try, you only have to look at the numpty running your country.

"""So nothing specific to eliminate the virus.""Social distancing and wearing a mask are very specific and very effective at eliminating the virus. If everyone did what I have done the world certainly would have been in a better place now. What did you expect me to say I'm developing a vaccine in my kitchen? If on the other hand we had social change years ago the virus would have either never came to be or would have been stopped before it could done such harm. Like I said above - lies, misleading and omissions. That really did the world in."

"What is interesting to me is how the OP has determined the truth from the many, many, opinions out there. The one thing that everyone I know who has any expertise in this area is agreed upon is that ‘nobody knows’ . There are good scientific opinions about the pros & cons of masks, the appropriate ‘ social distance’ and just about everything else.

"If travel restrictions don't work, how do you explain NZ and Australia?Almost all their cases of Covid in the last few weeks have been traced back to people coming into the country and tested - even the one who appears (obviously not conclusive) to have triggered the spike in Melbourne.With several state borders still closed, Australia has 'managed' the virus by that and strict quarantine measures. Quarantine there is in a hotel with guards outside to prevent people leaving their rooms so citizens cannot even quarantine in their own homes. People aren't even allowed outside for fresh air, exercise or to smoke. Our quarantine measures are not nearly as strict as you're allowed to self isolate in your home but are allowed out to buy food if you cannot get it any other way. No guards, no police checking on you either (well, some random checks I believe).Fauci may say shutting borders and quarantine don't work but the results in NZ and Australia certainly seem to have disproved that theory."

The OP claims 'some people ... are wrong about the up to date science on virology', a straw man argument as it stands.'Many authorities lie, mislead and omit. There's no reason why this has to be. None.' Indeed. With that I'd ask those in the States to use your vote wisely and with careful consideration this November. But with that, the disingenuous statement 'There's no reason why this has to be.' either shows the OP's naïveté or wilful disregard that those in positions of power are often determined to do whatever it takes (no matter how mendacious or self-serving their behaviours) to retain their position.

"Although the OP claims to be a respecter of social distancing, the whole of their initial enquiry read as an attempt to see how far the boundaries of social distancing (in the form of self-isolating on arrival from a country for which this is mandated) could be pushed or how loosely they could be interpreted.Social distancing is more nuanced than simply staying two metres away from other people where possible.

"Citing an article from February 29th is akin to a doctor using texts by Hippocrates or Galen. This is what the WHO wrote on July 2nd‘ While open borders are vital for the free flow of goods and people, initial analysis by WHO found that lockdowns along with public health measures reduced the spread of COVID-19. Even with border restrictions, imported cases have sometimes brought back COVID-19 to countries which had not reported cases for a length of time. For example, Seychelles had not had a locally transmitted case since 6 April 2020, but in the last week 66 new cases – all crew members of an international fishing vessel – have been recorded.“Air travel is vital to the economic health of countries,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “But as we take to the skies again, we cannot let our guard down. Our new normal still requires stringent measures to stem the spread of COVID-19.”To resume international air travel, WHO recommends that countries assess the epidemiological situation to determine whether maintaining restrictions outweighs the economic costs of reopening borders if, for instance, there is widespread transmission of the virus. It is also crucial to determine whether the health system can cope with a spike in imported cases and whether the surveillance and contact tracing system can reliably detect and monitor cases.“"

"Post 74 contains a pull quote without context; 1/10, must do better.With regard to this 'countries assess the epidemiological situation to determine whether maintaining restrictions outweighs the economic costs of reopening borders' the decisions made should be done with as much data and understanding of it that can be assembled on the day, with the knowledge that virus activity and countries' responses to it as well as actions of governments will centre on their own needs first rather than what may benefit the larger outcome.'To those who say I'm irresponsible for travelling: Your government allows it so it must be safe.

">>> That's totally false and shameful. <<<I apologise. For failing to feel the shame. I still interpret your original post as wanting to push the boundaries; after all, it's quite a stretch of the imagination for self-isolation to include moving around in public to visit shops and takeaway outlets and to mingle with others in breakfast rooms. But say those are allowed - what do you push for next? And how do you keep yourself safe from people for whom few or no boundaries seem to exist? They are out there, I do my best to keep socially distanced, but in a situation where I rely on someone else to respect my space and they fail to do that, there is not a lot I can do about it.Edited: 4:28 am, July 18, 2020 "
"OPIf you're going to quote organizations like the WHO, please post the passages quoted in full, not just cherry pick the words or sentence that suit you - it gives the appearance that you are less honest."
"So if you go ahead with this, does that mean you are going to spend thousands of Dollars just to prove that the UK Government cannot (according to the WHO) impede your Human Rights?OrIs it a case you will come here, present your Contact Form to Border Control, and go to your Hotel, then next day go out and enjoy London for the next 14 days and stick two fingers to the UK Government and say “get it right up you”! In the hope that you will be one of the 80% who do not get checked up on!"
"#85, having reread the OPs post again I agree that it sounds as if the OP was going to push the rules. S/he talks about going to supermarket, breakfast room etc, why would anyone think they can do that if in Quarantine? So it sounded as if they were not going to stick to the rules.S/he also says they will now come and quarantine and “and get me bearings.” Why do you need to get your bearings if you’re sitting in a hotel room for 2 weeks? You only get your “bearings” when out and about.Seeing as the ‘numpty’ of a President always only quotes the few words he wants to make him sound better, the OP must be taking a leaf out of his book!I think this is a big wind up but entertaining."
"I await the thread in which the OP announces s/he’s arrived in the U.K. without being checked or challenged and has impressed everyone with his/her knowledge of Covid 19 to the extent he/she is allowed to set their own rules as regards what constitutes quarantine and is free to mill about the hotel, restaurants and tea shops unimpeded. And all from a keyboard in the comfort of their own home."
"Exactly!It's better to have a heated debate here, than across the breakfast table with your partner....."
Where’s John S? It’s time he re-emerged from under the carapace of his disgruntlement to come to the defence of the OP again.
"Seems as if the OPs original question has revealed that we don’t know ourselves what is allowed under the quarantine regs.Someone under quarantine can go out shopping for essentials such as food and medicine if there is no one else to get them for them https:/…So they can use public transport to get to their final destinationMaybe the tube, walk the streets , a couple of train journeys and a bus ride to their accomodationAnd whilst there they can Visit supermarket to buy food Get takeaway food - delivery preferred but not all outlets offer delivery.Use Butchers , bakers etc They could go out every other day or indeed every day if necessary- there is nothing to say how often they can go outWhat about exercise ? I believe the OP original question was genuine .They were asking what they could do here , not necessarily wanting to flout the rules There is no need to flout the rules they have more holes in them than a colander .Maybe our OP is holding up a mirror to our silly regs.If they are trolling / trawling they have caught a few fine fishes LOLEdited: 6:58 am, July 18, 2020 "
"""Someone under quarantine can go out shopping for essentials such as food and medicine if there is no one else to get them for them""I am sure the OP's chosen hotel could organise food or arrange delivery and also for medicines so that wouldn't qualify for an essential break of quarantine.

"""dont come to spread yours here until you have it under control""Travel does not make virus levels any worse, if virus already exists in a community, like it does in England. In fact as you can see in this post the WHO does not advise travel restrictions unless at the very beginning of an outbreak (and only gives some time to prepare). In fact travel restrictions can make things much worse overall, such as economic damage. If your government thought a travel restriction was effective in keeping the virus under control wouldn't they just have simply implemented one? They did mandate a 14 quarantine, which in itself is not a travel restriction (but acts as one to a large degree for tourists). The rational for the mandate is that most Covid-19 cases have an incubation period up to 14 days. The WHO does state that everyone should follow local quarantines. I agree.Edited: 6:06 pm, July 20, 2020 "

I find it extremely difficult to believe that the top epidemiologists and virologists in the world would dispense such important information if it wasn't true or had geographical exceptions. Maybe they are all wrong. Maybe the thinking has in fact changed and the WHO and all the news articles forgot to update their websites.

"As the OP has decided against travel this mildly diverting thread is, like many others, of little relevance."
"'In fact as you can see in this post the WHO does not advise travel restrictions unless at the very beginning of an outbreak (and only gives some time to prepare). In fact travel restrictions can make things much worse overall, such as economic damage.' Once again a claim with nothing to back it up. Here is the almost five month old release from the WHO from which the OP chose one paragraph with no acknowledgement of how much things have changed since the end of February: https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detai…Re post 143, I am always disappointed that no one mentions Eccleston, and even worse that he was disparaged as Not Good Enough. Baker was my first and he certainly had instant appeal, but with the modern reboot Eccleston had a difficult task and performed exceedingly well."
I thought Eccleston was very good although not in my personal top three. Can't see any reason to be critical of him. Some more WHO https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gY5rztWa1TM
"I like the song by the WHO ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". Have you ever heard it? It's a song that is very relevant today. Good therapy, too. Listen with good headphones for the best results."
What about the current one?
Well this country had a team of 5 million that eliminated Covid. We currently have 23 active cases. They are all people who arrived from outside NZ and contained in isolation facilities.To suggest that travel restrictions don't work make me wonder ...?
"To suggest that travel restrictions don't work make me wonder ...?It's not just the WHO. It appears it's also the consensus of world's epidemiologists! There are numerous news articles from reliable news journals, too, that go into detail why governments go against such advice. They basically say governments go against the travel advice for ""political theater"" - appear to the citizens that the government is doing major things to control the virus. Social distancing and masks don't appear powerful enough. But yes, it makes me wonder as well. It needs more investigation."
"""We are proof it does work.""It certainly seems that way. That really makes me wonder why all the medical authorities advise against travel restrictions. It doesn't make sense. But as I noted earlier, I tend to follow what my doctor advises. In this case however people's freedom to travel is being deprived by governments. If it's based on medical science I would support that but as you can see medical science apparently says otherwise."
"Posts 154 and 156 make one think of exams at school and uni where the dread phrase 'show your work' was indicated with the questions. Not doing so meant losing marks, and as such unsubstantiated answers were just not on. Hmm."
"""at school and uni where the dread phrase 'show your work' was indicated with the questions. Not doing so meant losing marks,""In the real world it's often not needed at all. People can tell when something is legitimate or not. In any event I gave you the exact instructions where to find the information. Others have found some of it and have agreed that what I said is true."
"All of the restrictions made in NZ are based on the science. Our Public Service is non political, and it was their advice that our borders should close to incoming travellers other than citizens and residents and our government acted on that advice.The effect of this has been no community transmissions. There are now NO restrictions internally."
There’s no doubt about travel restrictions Stop people travelling then you stop infection spreading Simple

"@#158.“Some people have found it and agreed with what I said”I agreed that having read the WHO report from February that yes you are quoting from an official written Paper!But I went on to state that every Sovereign State has the right to close its Borders or impose Restrictions (Quarantine) on those entering said Borders.Nothing the WHO can say or write trumps that fact!So in that respect, please respect our right to discourage you from traveling to our Shores!"
"""What about the current one?""Haven't seen the show for many years so no idea."
"Medical opinion is always just that, opinion. You can always find another doctor who will give an opposing diagnosis or treatment. One believes they are right, the there believes they are right.I would more easily accept the evidence that we have, that closing borders worked for both Australia and NZ.What we don't know is what will happen when they open their borders...."
"The harder and longer the lockdown the more successful it will beNew Zealand unlike the UK may be less of a hub for traffic passing through and it was always my opinion that London Heathrow should have been closed early in the explosion of the virus.However, whilst a lockdown observed by all will stem the spread of the virus your country could be bankrupt when you reappear.Once salary and pension cheques dry up we all have to be realistic"
"""All of the restrictions made in NZ are based on the science.""How do you explain the WHO and all the epidemiologists advising against travel restrictions? These doctors have been studying the subject for decades. NZ is right and they are wrong? It definitely appears that way and that's very troubling."
"It is correct that we are not a hub. We also live in lower density and it was summer.We have our own epidemiologists, one was recently appointed to peer review the Oxford study. The facts are we set a goal of elimination. Closed our borders and had a few months of very tight lockdown. Opinion polls initially showed 92% support for Government action. This has dropped back to 88%.So far it has worked.A former PM, Helen Clark, is on the panel reviewing the WHO response.The same rules will not work the same everywhere. But you need a clear idea of what it is you are trying to do."
"""The same rules will not work the same everywhere.""That still doesn't address the question of why medical authorities do not advise travel restrictions. If there were major exceptions they would have said. I think what's happening now is the world is following what has worked and what is working, regardless of what science says. While I typically follow my doctors orders my doctors have been definitely wrong at times. In addition I have seen the doctors of others make very bad calls, including damage to the patient."
"Wendtr,Thank you for wanting to visit our beautiful country. However, at the moment, we are not in a good place to welcome visitors which is why we have put in place the restrictions. There is no loophole to the self quarantine rule. We, and all the other people on TripAdvisor will let you know when you are welcome again. We look forward to that time."
"""we are not in a good place to welcome visitors"" At this point I have come to the conclusion that for the good of everyone all people should stay at home this summer. Social distance, wear a mask and practice proper handwashing. Those are the simple ways we can get back to normal the fastest and safest. I look forward to visiting England hopefully next summer.Edited: 2:13 am, July 22, 2020 "
"One only has to look at what is now happening in two Australian states, Victoria and NSW to see that their bubble has burst. NSW may also go back to lockdown like Victoria.This seems to show, sadly, that closed borders work in the short term, but eventually you cannot escape the virus.No country or state will be able to keep their borders closed indefinitely, simply because of economics.I obviously had been thinking that closed borders was the answer, now it does look like it's not. I might have to eat my previous posts."
"Sorry gardengirl, but Australia and NZ shut their borders almost straight away, and it had worked, until now. The flare ups aren't being targeted more easily and the virus has spread in two states to the extent that Victoria is back in lock down and NSW will be following probably.It's probably true that if we had shut our borders the virus wouldn't have been so widespread as it is, but it does look like that, even with closed borders, once it comes in again, which it has (by returning residents mainly) it then becomes widespread."
"Wear a mask, social distance....... and don’t forget to practice proper recommended handwringing.Edited: 8:07 am, July 22, 2020 "
"Ella, I could be wrong but I thought the Victoria spike was attributable to mismanagement of returning citizens and permanent residents meant to be in quarantine and community contagion then arose from infected security guards et who had been in very close contact with the quarantees"
"As Bella says, the issue is what happens longer term. It may be that NZ really did get it right and will be a model for the future, but it’s also possible they’ll face more waves in the future and will find they can’t successfully reopen their borders, with the consequent economic effects.There’s also the possibility that the success in the Eastern hemisphere was partly down to dealing with a less transmissible variety of the virus. Apparently, by the time it got to Europe then on to the US, a spike in the virus had mutated from a D variant to a G variant that was more highly transmissible:https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30817-5.pdf"
"re 175 - close but hand washing, not handwringing ;-)As a new study ""Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government-imposed social distancing on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic: A modelling study"" explains."
"I did not come up with this theory just passing it on for consideration in this never - ending thread. Much of the reaction to the virus is dictated by cultures and societal norms which are firmly ingrained in our psyche....so debating it is quite futile. The Chinese communists, for example, merely welded residential doors of those suspected of carrying the virus shut from the outside. Whether those people had food or water or medical treatment is unknown but they were sure isolated. In some cultures people believe in and are compliant with orders from ""the government"" so being told to stay home, wear masks or any other restriction is no biggie and is for the common good. I was amused to read one poster pledge to stay home and do whatever the gummint said because, well, we have to believe in and follow the orders of the gummint. In other cultures, suspicion and distrust of government officials is already baked into the cake so when they are told to do something they rebel and exert their independence from groupthink. Who is right or wrong no one knows but trying to get a worldwide consensus or a common plan would be like herding cats. Somewhere between Sweden and Communist China I suppose."
"AmoMondo, yes that was the start of it, but it has since spread to NSW. Almost all the new cases were from returning residents (and no wonder they're not welcoming tourists at the moment!). Western Australia's state border remains resolutely shut and while they have had some new cases, they too, were from people coming into the country - in their case, it was from a cattle carrier boat returning to base. They quarantined onboard (with guards).John S - what you say is really interesting especially as I don't think Australians are renowned for being compliant but they have been much better than the Brits.... I doubt we'll ever see the 'correct' way of dealing with a pandemic, well not this one anyway, but hope we might have learned some lessons for the future..."
"Oh I agree, but there were (too) many that didn't feel the rules applied to them, from the start.Living in Cornwall, I have seen the many second homes being visited before the owners were allowed to.I think the only way to get an accurate picture is to judge by percentages...which, of course, we don't have. But with my children and other family living in Australia, I had 'inside' knowledge about how well people were behaving and a son in the police force, who was involved from the outset maintaining the closure of state borders. No sneaking off to holiday homes there! WA, where they live even divided the state into regions, and you weren't allowed to travel out or in - and you had to apply for a special exemption to do so.We didn't have police guarding county borders or the borders between countries in the UK."
"We were welcoming the tourists back, being a poor county relying on tourism mostly, but the behaviour of some, just in our area in the last week or so has been awful. I'm sure there are more than usual, and dare I say it, many of the sort who think it's ok to park anywhere, including the bottom of our farm track, making getting in and out almost impossible.There have been several incidents on the water too. A friend had his boat rammed by an incompetent boat driver, causing a hole in the rigid inflatable tubes, meaning our friend could have sunk, if it weren't for the gaffa tape he had on board..... It was not a local. Too many on the river are exceeding the speed limit and one almost ran a paddle boarder over. A couple got stranded on a beach when the tide came in and several children have been rescued when swimming unsupervised.Yes, some of this happens every year, but not as many incidents in one week (just in our locale!)"
"""This seems to show, sadly, that closed borders work in the short term, but eventually you cannot escape the virus.""This is exactly what all the medical scientists say. They also point out that travel restrictions can do much social and economic harm. What has shown to work well, as I said earlier, is for everyone to simply social distance, wear masks and properly wash hands. With this behavior the virus can be kept at a low and very manageable level until there is a vaccine."
"First this 'People can tell when something is legitimate or not. In any event I gave you the exact instructions where to find the information. Others have found some of it and have agreed that what I said is true.' from the OP then this 'I have come to the conclusion that for the good of everyone all people should stay at home this summer. Social distance, wear a mask and practice proper handwashing.'The first includes little that is claimed unless this 'Search in a search engine for excellent articles in foreignpolicy [sic] and the economist [sic].' is considered 'exact instructions'. The conclusion drawn by the OP is reliable - for her or him only rather than 'all people'.'""This seems to show, sadly, that closed borders work in the short term, but eventually you cannot escape the virus."" This is exactly what all the medical scientists say.' If that's what they say then name them. 'They also point out that travel restrictions can do much social and economic harm.' The source for this is what?"
"I don't have a source TravellerPlus, but our media has stories of businesses closing every day, and more people losing their jobs - both have economic repercussions.Socially, people haven't been able to see their families. I for one am not allowed to fly to Australia to se my children and grandchildren - that's social harm isn't it?"
"Not you at all, Bella, but the OP, who has claimed throughout that 'all the medical scientists' or experts are saying this, that, and the other. The OP claimed the travel ban was harmful and it was pointed out that the pull quote used had been made at the end of February this year before the solids really struck the air conditioning and things went mad.I agree that businesses have been hit hard and plenty of people have lost their jobs and are managing to hold on by a thread (v stressful), but at the time the decisions made were done to try and put the brakes on something very much unknown. Restrictions have been loosened with different results and are still in flux as the virus doesn't know what the modelling indicators are and further, does not care what has been suggsested might happen.'Socially, people haven't been able to see their families. I for one am not allowed to fly to Australia to se my children and grandchildren - that's social harm isn't it?' Yes it is social harm. Mental health for many was precarious at the start of this and restrictions have not improved things. Knowing that the restrictions were in place (to be blunt) to keep us alive is little comfort. The columnist MD in Private Eye mentioned 'dread risk' which has kept people at home who should have been willing to see their GPs about chronic illnesses or acute exacerbations of problems as well as ensuring they got outside to take some exercise whilst staying safe. That dread risk is still a problem and won't be beneficial to those who are in emotional dire straits, whether having a bad day or grieving in a way that they cannot see their children or grandchildren. In short, it's a big problem that's going to have repercussions for some time. Apologies to you Bella for the misdirect."
A long but worthwhile read about the psychological impact of the pandemic: https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interac… At a guess I may not be the only one whose blood pressure rises when seeing signs or adverts reading 'we're all in this together' as it's clear we are not.
"I'm being to think that the virus, the lockdown, the economic outlook and the restrictions on travel and so many other aspects of our daily lives are beginning to affect me mentally. Being retired I don't have any worries about losing my job, but I am concerned about rising taxes, costs and the effect on my pension in the future.IN the last couple of weeks I've also recognised that I've become increasingly fearful of being in close proximity to others (except my wife). I instinctively step away from people even if we are more than 2m apart. I wonder what other things I'm doing that I haven't even noticed yet.I've never thought we are all in this together. We never are."
"Apology accepted but no offence taken, Traveller Plus!I agree with you and RojBlake, that the whole situation is beginning to take its toll.I've been very strong throughout, thus far, but I was assuming there would be an end sooner rather than later, and now it's become obvious that our lives are changing and there is no end in sight. Like you Roj, we're retired and are now beginning to worry about our pensions income, when we thought we had planned accordingly for a healthy, long retirement.I'm desperate to see my children and grandchildren and struggle with the fact that I haven't got (and can't have) a date booked, which I can look forward to seeing them. We are supposed to be moving to Australia next year, all carefully planned and organised, and we own a house there and it feels like our best laid plans might fall apart. I've no idea now, how I'll cope with that.I wish there had been a 'right' way to tackle the pandemic, but there doesn't seem to be one."
"Unfortunately citizens returning from overseas are causing the main issues if the Pandemic leaves the quarantine area as happened in Victoria where the security gaurds were not enforcing the social distancing policy and took the disease out of the hotel area and into the community and then one person drove from Victoria across the border and affected many in NSW that is how quickly it can spread.I feel until there is a vaccine Australia will be reluctant to open up to the rest of the world.Only time will tell.Edited: 2:36 am, July 25, 2020 "
"Statistically, it is unlikely a vaccine will be that effective, like our flu vaccine. There hasn't been a vaccine yet effective for a Covid infection.You might be waiting a long time."
"“I wish there had been a 'right' way to tackle the pandemic, but there doesn't seem to be one.“There was never a “right” way as little was known about this virus in its early days. Countries took different approaches and its only in hindsight that we have learnt what may have been more effective.Much was said about Australia and NZ being so good at containing the virus but now they stand in splendid isolation not wanting the virus to ‘invade’ their countries, understandably. But how long can that go on at sometime borders will need to open, can you keep your residents ‘hostage’? Returning residents have a right of entry, bringing the virus, do governments pay for quarantine, huge cost implications? So in the long run was that a better approach, I don’t know?As for not opening until there is a vaccine, that must be way in the future until enough is tested, made and given. I understood it took years for vaccines to be developed but there seems to be an expectation that this vaccine will be around very soon. As the virus seems to be mutating how effective will the first vaccines be?We are just going to have to learn with the ‘new normal’."
"There is an awful lot that we still don't know, even though we have learned quite a bit. I think it's inevitable that mistakes have been made, the discussion should really be about the number and timing of what we now think were poor decisions.The mutation of this virus into something that might be even worse, is one of my biggest concerns."
"I agree Smudge. the new normal might be a very frightening thing.The Australian government began paying the two weeks quarantine but now it's the other way round - approximately $2500 per person.At first I thought they had got it 'right' but I don't think they can sustain the current situation and will have to open their borders, which may well take them to where we (in the UK) were a few weeks ago..."
"I don't think there's much suggestion that there is any great degree of immunity in the UK population, so you might think that an infected person coming into the UK would have the same impact as an infected person coming into Australia.Isn't the issue here that we in the UK have all changed our behaviour, in ways that probably haven't happened in countries that weren't hit as hard as we were? In many respects, for many people, life has returned to normal in terms of what we are permitted to do. But even if restrictions were lifted completely people wouldn't go back to the way they used to live. If someone outside your immediate family tried to shake your hand or give you a hug you'd think they were crazy. Many would tend to avoid restaurants that weren't enforcing social distancing. I daresay that after a couple of months people will automatically pull a facemask up if they go in a shop. None of these little things actually have a significant impact, all of them could be more effective, but cumulatively they work.The challenge for countries that have largely escaped so far is to change this fairly low level day to day behaviour"
"The vaccine work genuinely does seem hopeful. They’ve telescoped work that would normally take years into months, so if either of the first two (an American one and Oxford) are effective they should be available at least for those most at risk by the beginning of next year. There comes a point where we just have to factor risk in as we do with everything else, and allow people to make their own decisions. We need to prevent the health service being overwhelmed, and things like masks, screens etc should stay in place. But at some point it should be seen as a choice whether you go to the theatre. I, sadly, probably wouldn’t until things were better; but if I was in my 30s I would."
"If not the ""right"" way to handle the pandemic, perhaps a better way, at least in US, would have been to read the news, listen to experts, and shut down earlier. I have seen estimates on the number of lives that would have been saved if New York had shut down just one week earlier and it is staggering.And when I say read the news and listen to experts I do not mean just current news, on Wuhan and Italy, or current expert opinion, but also what experts have warned for years about pandemics, while our governments were cutting funding for public health."
"'There hasn't been a vaccine yet effective for a Covid infection.' That's true, but with work done in the past on vaccines for Sars and Mers we've got a head start. If ultimately we'll need annual jabs as with influenza vaccinations then so be it. If a beneficial antiviral treatment is found which would address symptomatic treatment or reduce the severity of ilness caused by the virus then bring it on.'As the virus seems to be mutating how effective will the first vaccines be?' Some of the mutations are with regards to the receptors in our blood to which the virus attaches. If memory serves there is work being done on vaccines to address multiple receptors, giving a bit of a scattershot approach rather than a single targeted vaccine.Acceptance of risk, changes in behaviour, and continued attempts to limit transmission will be needed in the short term at least. I suspect that the number of persons having contracted the virus is much higher than what we know, and with that there are that many more people who ideally won't make for future hosts for the virus which is a good thing. We know so much more than we did six months ago, with plenty more to learn. I'm not necessarily a glass half full person but for my own mental health I have to hope for the best results from work done on treatment and prevention, and bravo to those making Herculean efforts."
"""at least in US, would have been to read the news, listen to experts, and shut down earlier. ""If everyone would have simply social distanced, wore masks and practiced proper hand hygiene months ago the virus may no longer exist now."
"""Possibly, possibly not.""If the virus can not transmit it ceases to exist. The three practices: social distancing, masks and proper hand washing should be all that is need to prevent the virus from transiting."
"What about people who live in Africa, for example, many of whom don't have access to clean water, let alone masks! Globally it will surely be impossible to eradicate it on those practices alone?"
