"Another media report...Mexico declares health emergencyBy Yucatan Times on March 31, 2020Mexico declared a health emergency on Monday March 30th, and issued stricter rules aimed at containing the fast-spreading coronavirus after its number of cases surged past 1,000 and the death toll rose sharply.Health officials reported a total of 1,094 cases of coronavirus, up from 993 a day earlier, and eight more deaths, taking its total to 28. They reiterated warnings that the health system could be overwhelmed if the coronavirus is not contained.The new measures to fight the virus include a reduction of the number of people who can gather to 50 and an extension of a previously announced suspension of non-essential activities.“This applies – strictly – to people older than 60 years, those who have hypertension, diabetes or are pregnant, regardless whether their jobs are considered essential,” said Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell.Mexico has one of the world’s highest rates of both obesity and diabetes, and experts have recently sounded the alarm that its population could therefore be more vulnerable than its relatively young average age might suggest.Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who announced the health emergency, said that people or companies who ignored the rules would face administrative or penal actions. The emergency would be in force until April 30, he said.Unlike most regional peers, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has not ordered a lockdown or other drastic measures to control spread of the coronavirus due to concerns Mexico’s already slumping economy would take an even bigger hit.Source: https:/…"
"Governor says everyone to stay at home, healthy distance is no longer enoughBy Riviera Maya News on April 1, 2020Chetumal, Q.R. — State Governor Carlos Joaquín González says that the measures of social distancing has been reinforced, since healthy distance is no longer enough, adding that citizens must stay at home.“Stay home and don’t go out,” he reinforced during his official broadcast message.He explained that the measures include requesting the Secretary of Public Security and National Guard to ask people to stay home, intensify the health questionnaires at terminals, put sanitary filters in the seven ground entrances to the state, add filters throughout of the federal highway and in accesses to the cities, and to increase official communication.The governor requested the understanding of the citizenship and warned that there would be sanctions for those who refuse to participate in the filters.He reiterated that personnel of health, civil protection, public safety, justice, commercial regulation and transportation continue to work, but all the rest of the state government personnel work from home, only leaving security guards in the buildings.Joaquín González indicated that there is an agreement with supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and other businesses to maintain adequate supplies. He added that various companies such as water, telephone, internet and pay television have already agreed to defer billing payments and that on that same note, the government is still working with IMSS, Infonavit and Fonacot.He noted that more than 400,000 food baskets will be provided house-to-house in food support, a program, he says, will be unveiled later this week.Source: https:/…2020.html"
"I had a big outing today. I went to buy groceries. The declaration hasn't changed a whole lot as far as businesses are concerned. A few are closed but basically it's the same as a few days ago. But, there are definitely less people in the streets. So I'm not sure these places are doing any volume of business. Restaurants are open but appear to want to do just takeout as many have their tables and chairs covered in plastic cling wrap. Shelves were kind of bare in Wal-Mart but I got most of what I needed. Mostly fresh stuff like fruit and veggies. Canned goods were pretty much picked over."
"In case anyone's curious what this emergency means exactly, I drafted an English translation:THE EPIDEMIC GENERATED BY COVID-19 IS DECLARED AS A SANITARY EMERGENCYAs of March 30, the following measures apply:The suspension until April 30 of non-essential activities in the public, private and social sectors is mandated.In the sectors determined as essential, meetings of more than 50 people is discouraged. Hygiene, health prevention and social distance measures should always be applied.The entire population residing in Mexican territory is encouraged to comply with the co-responsible domiciliary restraint (voluntary limitation of mobility).Home protection is strictly applied to anyone over 60 years of age, pregnant women, or people with chronic or autoimmune diseases.After April 30, the Health Secretary, in coordination with the Labor and Economy Secretary, will issue guidelines for the gradual resumption of activities.All censuses and surveys are postponed until further notice.All measures must be applied with strict adherence and respect for human rights.We need your cooperation to defeat the coronavirus"
I should amend my post to say that my boyfriend got home from work about an hour ago. He comes home a different way than I would from Wal-Mart and said many small and medium sized businesses are closed with signs on their doors saying they'll reopen on May 1. It appears many are choosing to close.
"The declaration states all non-essential business are ordered to close. I have the full list but for now...Example:Hair Saloon-closedHardware Store-openThere's a lot of grey areas, but that's the gist.Edited: 6:15 pm, April 01, 2020 "
May 1 reopening for non-essential businesses may be optimistic.
"Hahaha Joan S you got me good!Yes in my 35 years living in the US I always walked straight into that one! For some reason my brain never nailed that one in place, also with the names David and Daniel.Anyway another example,Markets are allowed to be openArcheological Zones are closed."
"""After April 30, the Health Secretary, in coordination with the Labor and Economy Secretary, will issue guidelines for the gradual resumption of activities.""Based on this it seems they're going to stagger the resumption of non-essential activities. I'm sure everything is closed is hoping they'll be one of the first to resume."
"Joan, thank you for keeping us posted. This is a painful time for everyone around the world with this virus. As you hear of ways to help the people and children in the area, could you keep us posted? Stay safe, take care.Your shopping trip sounds like one around here lately....get most of what you want/need but a few items are out of stock."
Very good Information for sure.Make a sticky.!?
"Joan, I believe that In Mexico as in the U.S. and some other countries that on April 30 businesses will start to reopen if the epidemic has lessened adequately. The closure order may be extended at that time. Let us all hope that they open."
https:/…db02704d24faa6190afdd407074b7f84Not looking Good for even the Fall Anyplace.So sad.
April 30 - not a chance. The US was way to slow in reacting.
"Snorkeler, I guess that by your comment Canada will be up and running on April 30.  I grow tired of people from other countries faulting the U S when their country does as poorly or worse. Or sometimes seemingly nothing.Don't depend on us to set the course and then find fault if we do not. That is unless you start paying taxes in the U S."
"Calmjohn, please calm down, we all need to stay calm.Btw, he is absolutely correct, the US was slow to act and continues to do so...look at how many states still do not have stay at home orders!"
"Slow to at compared to what? Which other country?? . We should not be pointing fingers. We should be doing what we can and give credit where deserved and not find fault with anyone other than seeing our own short comings, Too many people like to tell the U S what and how they should do things, but don't point the finger back."
"It is no secret (even to Americans), that the US was too slow to react and they are payng for it. I'm not even sure why anyone would argue that?"
"The fact is that no one really knows. It's easy to point fingers from the comfort of our homes. Just like I resent people stirring the pot against Mexico's statistics, I dislike those that daily post against US policy. Or any other country that's not our country for that matter. It's not like we have officials who relish on having their constituents dropping like animals left and right.What happens is that these are the numbers we have, folks, and the global community can't really keep up with the pandemic, that's true. But unless we have other facts and numbers to counter their argument, we can focus on taking care of ourselves, our neighbors and our own countries instead of raising hysteria on a travel forum.Edited: 4:55 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"""I grow tired of people from other countries faulting the U S when their country does as poorly or worse. Or sometimes seemingly nothing.Don't depend on us to set the course and then find fault if we do not. That is unless you start paying taxes in the U S."" I have to say I completely agree. Not sure what other parts of Mexico are like but it does get old to hear the constant USA bashing here. I hear it from taxi drivers, people in the stores, and just about everywhere wlse. I usually just smile because it's useless to argue but as my Grandma always said, ""People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.""I get that everyone does not love the U.S. but I wouldn't think of criticizing Mexico (or any other country) to the the extent that some criticize the US."
"Hey Joan are you fluent in Spanish?I'm not doubting what you're saying about US bashing which is an international sport, and not only in Cancun. I was just wondering if you're overhearing conversations or it's directed at your person and in what language. I travel quite a bit and Mexico bashing is very popular in Central America which is understandable. I'm not gonna touch the subject of US-Mexico relations of course. Coming back to the point, it's rather unfortunate that adults would want to engage in a hissing match over nationality. Even worse, use a travel forum as a platform for dissing other country's politics or foreign policy. I realize it's tempting and it's almost a requirement for TA Mexico demographics but once again, I think we're better than that.Edited: 6:11 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Joan - Miguel - Thank you for your very intelligent comments. I am sure that any of the three us could find many legitimate stones to throw in any direction, but as you say a travel forum or even a lounge with people who are from several different countries is very lacking in couth in my way of thinking. During my 30 years in the U S military It was amazing how many countries that in times of trouble relied on the U S for military and financial protection and when the incident had passed found fault because the U S did not do more to provide for them.And in this world wide problem, I see no other country offering aid to the U S. I do not see them with a vaccine or other medications. I do not see them , if they have no problems of their own, offering aid for once to the U S. , Just snide remarks. To me that is just ignorance. The problem is that when it is all in control the U S will offer aid to all again...and they will, as usual, ungratefully accept. Just ungrateful children."
"Calling people ungrateful children is super classy. Thanks so much for that. As if Canada doesn't come to the aid of countrys who need it.And yes, the US was slow to react with 8 states still not implementing distancing measures, so that is not just throwing stones, that is just fact. JMO as an ungrateful child.lol."
"Oh. My. Goodness. We just really need to play nice and kind with each other. No country is perfect. I love Canada (Toronto side several times a year), Mexico (both coasts), and US (home country). We have LOST our ability to travel to other countries...we have not lost our ability to RESPECT other cultures.Many, many years TA has been a welcome stress relief. This is a forum topic called, ""Coronovirus emergency declared""...how did it get into country bashing???Kindness-always...and I have seen it played out so many times in Mexico, Canada, and the US. Set the example moving forward.Thank you Joan and Miguel."

I'm not gonna touch the subject of US-Mexico relations of course."" I wouldn't say that I'm 100% fluent in Spanish, Miguel. But close.I really wouldn't make that comment if it wasn't from personal experience. Sure, I've overhead d parts of conversations but I don't really pay much attention to that it's easy to misconstrue things when you only hear bits and pieces. And I do get that it's an international sport these days. But the comments made by taxi drivers and others are directed towards me. I get that the current President is a polarizing figure. On both sides really. You love him (for the most part) or you hate him. Not much middle ground.It just seems since the 2016 election a lot of people I meet seems to think I need to be educated on how terrible the U.S. Is and how the policies are responsible for all that's wrong with the world. My personal politics aside (I don't believe it's relevant) I don't appreciate being lectured like that and would never presume to tell a stranger what I think is wrong with their country. And then on top of that the people who do this all seem to want me to pay the gringo price for anything. There's a small store near me that I stopped going to because if I went a can of soda was $15 pesos but if my boyfriend went it was only $12. I don't play that game. Yes, I'm aware that Mexico bashing is a big part time in Central America. Quite honestly, I didn't realize it was as bad as it was until we went on a cruise and had several ports of call in Central America. And like you, I'm not touching US-Mexico relations with a 10 foot pole. And this absolutely is not the place to rip apart other countries foreign policy. There are plenty of places for that."
I agree and do ask why do we get into country bashing. The only country here that was getting bashed was the U.S. Laurie P - Would you by chance be an elementary school teacher?Now I agree that we should get back to the subject that caused us to get off when someone started bashing the U S.I just canceled my June trip today. Of course I had canceled my April trip a few weeks ago. Only have my November trip to Puerto Vallarta to look forward to. No U K or Europe trip this year. I am getting to be a home body it seems.
"""When will Mexico stop allowing flights for a certain amount of time? ""I think that will happen about the time that pigs fly. Sorry, didn't mean to be flippant but Mexico has repeated reiterated their position on this. They say they will not restrict any flights from entering the country. I don't see that changing becaiuse, in my opinion, if they were going to do that, they would have by now."
"Thanks for the detailed response @Joan S. You covered a lot of ground, I wish you would have made your points without bringing up names and mentions of politicians or even countries but here we are. 2016 wasn't the year the world reevaluated their relationship with the US. This wasn't brought forth by the present government. It's a tale as old as time and AMLO has actually been rather courteous to the US for my taste.Mexico is a very complicated country to discuss because of its historic and geographic location, as well as its sheer size and population. This is the reason for a certain envy from southern countries and a certain schadenfreude from others. We get it, we make people very nervous. As a visitor, your position is awkward because at the same time you're probably happy with many things and maybe uncomfortable about many others, like ""tourist tax"". I can't apologize for the tactless banter of taxi drivers and others who probably taunt you. I've been through that in other countries and it's infuriating but it comes with the territory. @Calmjohn and us were talking about the opposite: US bashing from others about their handling of the pandemic. I personally feel both US and Mexico governments are at fault, but I don't think that this is the place or even the time to discuss it. It's exhausting and petty to belabor the point instead of acting responsibly and follow the recommendations of experts to wash, distance and self-isolate instead of posting complaints and manifestos on Trip Advisor. If someone has a problem with US domestic policy, go post on their FB or their Twitter account, if someone has a problem with AMLO go to his rallies and yell at him, I seriously doubt either Trudeau, Trump or AMLO read Trip Advisor and neither of them can be bothered with our gossip."
"@calmjohn...3rd grade elementary teacher for many years (32 teaching, 7 retired but still substituting), who would just like everyone to play nice in the sandbox.Costa Rica in April...cancelled. We have small trips domestically...2 in June, one in August that will likely cancel. Our big trip to Australia for the month of October will also likely cancel. We are staying at home and trying to get life safe so that we all can safely travel again-especially to support those locations that thrive on tourism."
And now back to regularly scheduled programming.....I think Cancun is likely to see stricter measures to keep people home. Here's a link to an article (in English) about the crowds at a huge tiangus (flea market) yesterday. Apparently there was no social distancing and entire families went.https:/…2020.html
@Joan lol that actually made me laugh. Have a great Monday yourself
"#31 - Laurie P. Forgive me for posting about your profession, but my many years of intelligence work allows me to often understand things about people by the way and how that they express themselves.I commend you on your work and you must have loved it by not only your length of employment, but that you remain part-time."
"LOL Calmjohn...yes, teaching was and is my calling...I only retired because the ""rules"" weren't working for me! Substitutes don't have any rules!Back to Cancun-I just can only hope folks take the rules of social distancing seriously-my NY state just extended their ""Pause"" time until the end of April, and I hope they don't need to extend again.We all want our lives back again!!"
"sunloverg09,First off, you need to get your facts straight. 8 states are not ""not implementing distancing measures"", 8 states are not implementing stay at home measures. Big difference.We are one of those states who has not been mandated to stay at home, however, we have been repeatedly told to maintain a 6' distance between people, not congregate, not go to stores to just wander around, etc. With that said, I know here in Omaha, citations/tickets are handed out to those who are not complying."
"Sorry, as of when I posted this I was looking on the news and they highlighted the states (8 of them) that were not under state laws implemented in the rest of the USA. I worded it wrong, but still the same thing."
"Not at all the same. Just because we don't have the official mandate of ""stay at home"" doesn't mean we aren't doing it. Not sure which news you watch/read. As you may know, there are many, many that tell you what you want to hear.Since March 17, we have had restaurants, bars and non-essential stores closed. Restaurants are delivery or takeout only, as with the ""stay at home"" states. All of our park playground equipment is off limits. Movie theaters, zoos, etc., closed. As with the rest of the country, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. are all allowing only so many people per square foot of store.So, again, study the ""facts"" before making blanket statements about every state."
How about this forum be limited to posts about Cancun and Mexico? I think that is the intent.
"Marcus, I think when you are on the forums longer that you will understand that there is usually light banter mixed in with the hard facts about the subject. Were it not for the enjoyment of posting many very knowledgeable people would find it rather boring and many many people would not have their answers answered properly. Now is a time of stress and not many travelers are asking questions about hotels, attractions, etc. When the pandemic is over conversations will be more pointed to travel, etc. and best of all we will be here."
"""I think that will happen about the time that pigs fly.Sorry, didn't mean to be flippant but Mexico has repeated reiterated their position on this. They say they will not restrict any flights from entering the country.""I would have thought they would. Guatamala did and they aren't as a tourist destination like Mexico."
Sorry what?
"I was saying I was sorry if the person whose question I answered found my answer of ""when pigs fly"" to be flippant. And jordanbulls was quoting me."
"Oh I got that part @JoanI just wanted someone to translate into English:""I would have thought they would. Guatamala did and they aren't as a tourist destination like Mexico.""Edited: 12:16 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"Well, it is English, and I am able to comprehend the intention. He/she obviously meant “I would have thought [Mexico] would [have closed its airports to incoming flights ]. Guatemala did, and [it’s not as much of] a tourist destination like Mexico.”"
I'm not a native speaker. Thanks for your translation. I learn a lot here.
