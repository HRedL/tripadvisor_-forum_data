"we are planning a trip to the addo elephant park from bloemfontein and their seems to be 2 options option1 take the n 6 to aliwal north then the r 391 then the r 390 to cradock staying the night then the n 10 ,r 342 ,r 336 to the park. option2 take the n1 then the n 9 then n 10 to cradock then the same way to the parkwould like to know which is the best scenic and safe way to go??thanks for the contact j&t"
"From own point of view would go N1, N9 then N10 via Cradock. Very nice farmstall near Cookhouse on that route. Some traffic but not excessive. Found Aliwal North route more congested and road surface not great.Great scenery too if that's something that interest you."
The central part of the country is not really scenic - I would use Option 1 and high tail it to Mountain Zebra National Park and enjoy the scenery there.
"I would also avoid the Aliwal North route. If you want to do a meander then the state of the roads shouldn't be a huge problem and there are some ""side trips"" that you could do to places like Rhodes and Lady Grey. But this would make it very slow going and add a couple of days or so to the drive.But, if you do decide to take this route be aware that the R391 between the intersection with the R56 and Hofmeyr is a gravel road with long sections of corrugations running across the surface. You would also need to navigate over Groot Doringhoek Pass This pass is just a few kilometres after you cross over the R56 coming down the R391 from Burgersdorp and takes you through the Bamboes Mountains The road over the pass is not well maintained. It is just about possible to traverse it in an ordinary sedan in dry conditions. But I would not recommend trying to do so in wet conditions. There is also no cell phone signal as you cross the mountains.I would like to suggest a slightly different version of your N1, N9 and N10 route. The route that I would suggest takes you to Graaff-Reinet. https://goo.gl/maps/HUF3aPZtACECZTQL6A stopover in Graaff-Reinet gives you the chance to visit the Valley of Desolation. Watching the sun go down over the Karoo and the rocks changing colors as it does so has to be, in my opinion, a bucket list thing. Plus, not far from Graaff-Reinet is the village of Nieu Bethesda with its Owl House and a very good craft brewery http://www.nieu-bethesda.com/From Graaff-Reinet you just head east on the R63 through Pearston and Somerset East to join the N10 at CookhouseIf you decide to take the route which I have suggested don't be tempted to go south on the R335 from Somerset East to Addo if you are driving a sedan. The main reason not to do this is that after the intersection with the R400 the road takes you over the Zuurberg Mountains. Unless there has been major maintenance work on the road through the mountains in the past year or so (and I am 99.9% certain that there hasn't) you will end up leaving most of the underside of the car behind you !!!!!!!!!"
