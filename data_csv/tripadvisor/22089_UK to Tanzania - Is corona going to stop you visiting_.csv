Uganda have just updated their protocol for all UK arrivals to be self-isolated for 14 days even if asymptomatic.I cannot find any really recent guidance on Tanzania adopting the same on FCO (but even FCO hasn't updated on the latest for Uganda!) This may surely change in the next couple of days especially with the big 'P' word now official (Pandemic) and the consistent rise of cases and deaths in the UK.Has anyone been given advice really recently to cancel? I was only going to Dar for a week this Sunday... At the same time I do not want to be 'the one' who bought corona to Tanzania. I respect their choice to restrict visitors from certain countries - its just annoying I can't find info on what's going to happen before my trip!
"It is impossible to say what will happen tomorrow and then by Sunday, especially after what is happening in the US and some European countries in lockdown today.When I was traveling to Australia recently I received a message from the airline advising I might not be allowed on the plane if I had been to China that is now expanded. I suggest you wait till Sunday to see if there are any changes and also if you do get a message, if the Tz government won't let you in, the airline will be the first to know as they will have to take you back."
"“ if, the Tz government won't let you in, the airline will be the first to know as they will have to take you back.”Unfortunately NE, I wouldn’t bank on that!!! We were due to fly to Rome this morning with EasyJet and on Tuesday when Italy went into Lockdown and our UK foreign office were advising only essential travel, I spoke to EasyJet and they still insisted it was safe to to travel to Italy and the flight was not cancelled. They said if I cancelled at that point I would lose my money. It took until 2.30pm yesterday afternoon before EasyJet emailed me to say they had cancelled the flight and I could have a refund.So I wouldn’t rely on the airlines for advise....certainly in EasyJet’s case they were not helpful or accurate!!"
"I guess all airlines are different my email was from Qantas...I guess we will all know in the next few days, but in Tanzania I have been talking to people in Arusha just now and the knowledge people have there of Corona is small and most people ""are not worried at all"" except those in the tourism industry of course."
"Interesting NE . When we were there in February the Tanzanians we were with who don’t work in tourism were actually already very aware of Coronavirus and it came up in conversation quite often. They all actually did seem quite worried even then as the chances of stopping in spreading there would be virtually impossible and they obviously don’t have the medical services to cope. I would actually strongly urge anyone who shows any signs of respiratory infection or has been in contact with someone who has, to cancel any plans to visit Tanzania. They don’t have the virus at the moment and I can’t believe anyone wants to be the person responsible for introducing it to Tanzania as the if that happens I think the effects will be awful and affect far more than just tourism.Please everyone, act responsibly."
I agree with Shep on airlines. I have 'friends' trying to fly to Capetown via Milan. So far the airline is just 're-scheduling' their flight. The fact that their plane has not flown for the last scheduled six days seems to pass them by.As to my plans. We should NOT panic. I have plans to go in December and am progressing them. We don't know what next week may bring let alone December. I won't be buying any plane tix just yet though. If/when this thing lifts there may well be bargains to be had to get us all back travelling again. Or not as the case maybe.
"Thanks NE, although I worry about the public perception in Tanzania, for me it’s just whether I can get in to the country or not at all. At the same time maybe it’d be the best for everyone if I stayed away. I was looking forward to celebrating water week with friends there a lot, but can’t be selfish."
"Yes for you Mfuwe, your trip is a long way off and certainly no need to change plans at present.But I agree with stackingcats that at the moment this is not about us tourists but more about trying to protect the people of Tanzania from this virus. It is certainly a time to think of others and as you say to “not be selfish”....wise words.Edited: 8:03 am, March 12, 2020 "
"FCO updates Tanzania advice a few minutes ago:“The Government of Tanzania have put in place strengthened screening measures at airports for all passengers arriving into Tanzania’s three international airports (Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar). You will need to provide personal details and be subject to a temperature check. Those showing symptoms of coronavirus will be isolated at the airport and may subsequently be placed in quarantine in a government hospital. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.”So it seems they aren’t going as hard on asymptomatic visitors as other countries still with mandatory isolation upon arrival. Probably not worth the risk still. I’d rather they just announced all but essential travel.Full: https:/…coronavirus"
"Both sides of airports, departure and arrival, are looking for symptoms, if you are allowed to fly from Europe then you are heading to warmer regions of the world,Tz airports will not ask for anything else, besides a quick symptom check,Unless you had a long stop in another African country, then obviously will check for YF cert,The spread is more active in cold/winter regions of the world,Online data suggests the 40 degrees latitude line on northern parallel is where most countries need higher precaution and isolation practices,All funny business on main tv news, some predict it will take 18 months for new meds and one particular country says its three weeks away to trial meds,"
"Bina, perhaps you could spare us the pseudo science that you're spreading on several of the African forums.There are a good number of cases south of 40 degrees north latitude. Australia being just one notable example. There's no hard science yet to support the notion that warmer weather inhibits the virus. Its southern spread into places like Africa is slower due to lower volumes of long distance travel and a lack of testing. That is the opinion of many informed experts.Edited: 4:41 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Kronick. There is enough false info around without starting any more.Just pointing out that there is an Equator so once you get south of that, climates will be colder the further south one goes.From that one can presume that parts of Australia, astride the Tropic of Capricorn at 22.5 south, will be approaching the 40th parallel with Sydney at 34S and this will have the same bearing on the need for precautions as Europe. Always supposing that the spread of the virus IS linked to temperature.Totally unscientific but as the Virus is flu like and affects breathing there is some logic in the view that it will prevail and be more apparent in colder climates.I do know that some governments are planning for a reduction in the spread as warmer weather moves into Europe.Edited: 6:29 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Mfuwe Some health officials in Australia have said when winter arrives here it will be worse than now. Lets see.Who knows why East Africa has no confirmed cases.
"When you arrive in Africa in normal health, and suppose they suggest self isolation for certain days, its only an info sheet you will read while on holiday, they are not holding you at Airport, infact not at any Airport in the world unless you arrive with symptoms,There is no cure at home or away, is there, the emergeny miracle budgets will buy everything but bring immediate cure, India is not issuing new visas until 14 April, US has blocked Europeans for next 30 days, Canada's leaders wife just back from UK visit and now in self isolation,Some countries suggest if you arrive in normal health still isolate yourself at your hotel, but who is really coming around to check on you, this is just another way of not ruining a good economy,Anyway, all i hear is its a bioweapon designed to depopulate or global economic reset or cash to cashless, so Kronick you should be truely hongera its extra business coming home,"
I live in Hawaii with 80 F average around the year. And here it is spreading like wildfire in dry grass.
"Bina, your characterization of Covid-19 as a bioweapon makes it crystal clear how you think and see the world. Such an offensive comment has no place on a TA forum."

And we all know the earth is flat...
Not everyone Jurij.There are still some poor benighted souls who cling to the idea of a Blue Marble in space but where's the proof?
"If anyone has been following for updates: I chose to cancel my trip to Tanzania this time around. Other friends and colleagues have cancelled or have returned to the UK early from their trips in Tz on the fear of travel restrictions and bans that could effect entry/leaving. Tanzania seems slightly behind on announcing harsher checks and isolation on its borders compared to its neighbours (notably Uganda and Kenya) and I expect it to follow in the next coming days? Yesterday 6 Danish tourists were quarantined upon arrival into Kilimanjaro as one had a bit of a cold. They were tested for corona and released in a day and allowed to continue their trip - the health minister released a statement a few hours ago.Obviously I also do not want to bring corona to Tanzania, and neither do I want to face unnecessary isolation or quarantine for now. I hope it remains safe and resilient and I hope to back as soon as possible."
"StackingcatsA lot has changed since my earlier posts.As we all know many people are cancelling or being forced to cancel all non essential travel including to Tanzania. I am not surprised at your decision, and why expose Tanzanian's to the virus and why would you expose yourself to the virus, hopefully the wildlife will still be there and you can always travel next year. (think positive)I do feel for those in tourism in Tanzania as staff will be laid off, put on leave without pay and many small companies,those with loans especially, will struggle.It is the same the world over. My wife is a casual in a tourist business in Australia and everybody in tourism is being affected by this virus in a very serious way. I am also worried about those with health issues, and wonder how far this will spread and affect us all. I hope Tanzania can cope as I have children there.stackingcats I hope you can enjoy a safari sometime in the future and we can all get back to a relatively normal (whatever that is ) life."
"Thanks noexpert - although I wasn't travelling as a safari tourist. I was attending Dar for an event/celebration which I cannot reschedule. I'll be back soon I'm sure, there are many other things in Tanzania I want to do. Just a shame to miss out on such a good gathering, but I too was aware that meeting many people as an arrival from a corona virus country was becoming an increasing risk."

I see bina is spreading her opinions far and wide. She was already told in another forum that warm weather has not stopped the spread of the virus in Hawaii.
"Maryann, i am little disappointed, we are unique here, under represented in numbers on the forum, Posters usually jump into African forums without knowing much about their own home past history,Why would i say otherwise, i dont see how you relate other safe regions to the virus,And please dont compare me to ex banned members of the forum who re appear with new ID such as K,"
"noexpert -- I am particularly concerned for my friends in Tanzania who almost without exception have a serious underlying condition: malaria. Dormant most of the time, it remains a serious health concern throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, and when the virus arrives there in full, frightening flower it will encounter a population much more vulnerable than in most of the rest of the world.My friends and their children are in my thoughts daily. My husband and I are both in that ""vulnerable"" portion of the world's population and are currently in a self-isolation mode, worrying for ourselves and one another. But there are billions more vulnerable, still, than we -- and we can only hope that the inevitable suffering this vicious virus is positioned to inflict upon the world will at least teach humanity a lesson or two. Wildlife is dangerous as a food source in this modern world and, perhaps, we humans need to think about the limits of this planet to contain a human population seemingly determined to increase in numbers exponential into perpetuity. We can't keep doing this stuff and survive as a species, I fear.We are booked for next February. I am determined to keep counting down the days --- unless and until I can't. And I send a message to those in China whose greed for novelty may well hae caused this: stop eating bats and pangolins. Just stop it. They are not food for humans. And your wet markets are among the most cruel and dangerous places on earth."
"Bina. You must stop spreading your daft opinions. there are vulnerable people out there who might just believe you.""""Africa is a better option in any book right now,"""" No it is NOT!Uganda is already quarantining visitors as I believe is Tanzania etourists arriving in JRO were refused entry.The Namibian government is suspending inbound and outbound travel to and from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany with immediate effect for a period of 30 days,"" A couple arriving from Spain have been detained in quarantine.Namibia, Kingdom of eSwatini, Ethiopia and Rwanda have all reported their first coronavirus cases over the last 48 hours .It is sheer crassness to continue with your unwise advice when your knowledge is so limited.Safer by far to stay where you are in Europe and not travel."

"Kenya just announced a ban on travel from countries reporting cases of COVID-19. I wouldn't be surprised to see Tanzania do the same, sooner rather than later, to help protect its citizens and residents.Edited: 12:56 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Happy.Uganda says different.""UK plus Austria, Belgium China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, San Marino, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and USA. Those who do travel and are showing symptoms of Coronavirus may be placed in quarantine in a government hospital for 14 days. Those not showing symptoms will be required to place themselves in self-isolation (at home or at your hotel at your own cost) for 14 days. ""Also there are unconfirmed reports of tourists arriving at JRO this week being refused admission. I have no details at the present."
"FCO have just updated their travel advice for Tanzania - mandatory quarantine for all arrivals is being confirmed as we speak, especially after the first case of corona confirmed in Tanzania today - ""There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere. Cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Tanzania . The Tanzanian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including recommending self-isolation for 14 days for anyone coming from a high risk area. We are seeking clarification from the Government of Tanzania as to whether this includes the UK. See Health""Full: https:/…tanzania"
I am not sure who said Tanzanians didn’t know much about Coronavirus and weren’t worried about it ....but today I was contacted by one of the schools we support to say that as of today the school is closed due to fears over Coronavirus and trying to keep the children safe........Tanzanians definitely do know about Coronavirus and are as worried as anyone else in the world.
yes Shep all you have to do is listen to their President to know how concerned they are.
"Tanzania is taking very serious action with corona virus, we did not had any cases before and we just had our first person on 15th march whereby a Tanzanian lady flew from Europe to Kilimanjaro airport and from there our government worked well to make sure its not spread, the lady is at the special place whereby nobody can get in contact with her. Before this issue there were also suspected visitors whereby our government took and isolated them for check up and after few days they realized they were all okay and released them to proceed with their plans. yesterday our Tanzanian government decided to close down all the schools. I can just assure you that our government is very serious on this. We still have tourists who fly in for their wildlife safaris.Lets hope for the best, and Karibu Tanzania. Bright safaris team."
