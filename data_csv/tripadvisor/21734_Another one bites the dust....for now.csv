Just saw this in the WIFo.....https:/…
"Taste of Chicago IMO will be cancelled very soon, they already cancelled the huge annual hot air ballon fest in Lisle and that isn't until July. I think within the next week domestic air travel shuts down. The scariest thing to me is certain politicians saying that within a couple of weeks we should be back to normal."
"""I think within the next week domestic air travel shuts down.""As I sit at my computer looking north, normally I see several jets a minute on the flight path to ORD. For the last couple days, nada.Taste of Chicago, the 57th St. Art Fair, Old Town Art Fair, many events that take a lot of organizing and draw people from afar are probably on the chopping block."
Curious to see if they cancel the Democratic convention which kicks off in mid July not longer after Summerfest was supposed to end. If they don't someone is going to have some explaining to do.
"Trying to not get too political, but announcing a convention cancellation now would enrage Bernie Sanders’ supportersI’m afraid Pride Fest will be chopped soon. Perhaps the parade will be tentatively pushed to Market Days weekend (mid-August) to buy a bit of breathing room."
Wondering when they will announce Lolla is cancelled. Just checked their twitter feed & 14 hours ago they posted still in a holding pattern. Is it 2021 yet? Stay safe TA peeps!
The Trib has an article on the subject of to Lola or not to Lola this morning.
"""""I think within the next week domestic air travel shuts down.""""I thought that to, but the reality is it is in all 50 states now, shutting down domestic travel won't do much."
Of course shutting down domestic air travel will help. It is just another albeit extreme form of social distancing.B.
"""Curious to see if they cancel the Democratic convention which kicks off in mid July not longer after Summerfest was supposed to end. If they don't someone is going to have some explaining to do.""Postponed to mid- August -https:/…"
"I saw the new dates, it starts the Monday after the State Fair ends. WI has an awesome State Fair which we attend every year and spend the night. We are going August 15th which is the second to last day and man I'm glad I booked a room last month, there are very few rooms available anywhere near Milwaukee starting that weekend."
"@rfn44,I hope you booked a room with a refundable rate. I would not be too sure that the State Fair will take place. There are reports on news services that several big cats at the Bronx Zoo contracted COVID-19 from an infected but asymptomatic keeper. If cross-species transmission of the virus can happen so easily, will the participants want to exhibit their prize animals?https:/…This story also raises troubling questions for pet owners...."
I saw that this morning and honestly didn't think about the effect it could have on State Fairs with all the animals involved not to mention the zoos which along with so many other businesses are really hurting now. Room is refundable.
"The 35th annual Chicago Gospel Music Festival (May 27-30), the 37th annual Chicago Blues Festival (June 5-7) and the 5th annual Chicago House Music Conference & Festival (May 21-24) have been canceled.Also canceled: the Chicago Memorial Day Parade and Wreath Laying Ceremony (May 23); and Chicago in Tune (May 21-June 7),"
"Yes, s_s, I heard that on WGN this morning. June 6 and 7 is the 57th Street Art Fair with the Old Town Art Fair the weekend after. And the Grant Park Music Festival's first concert is June 10th. No COVID-19 updates on their respective websites. I expect the art fairs to be cancelled and the concerts in Grant Park to start late, if at all. UPDATE: the Old Town Art Fair has been cancelledLincoln Park Zoo's Run for the Zoo in early June has been switched to a virtual race. I guess participants sign up to participate, get their race packets in the mail and choose a time and place to do their run solo, then post their times...or something like that.Edited: 11:51 am, April 21, 2020 "
"several more festivals have been canceled or moved (not necessarily due to covid)......https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/custer-f…https://www.winnetkamusicfestival.com/winnetka is a real shame.... it's only been around a few years, but it's arguably the best festival between the chicago river and milwaukee.....but looking on the bright side, ravinia seems to be on schedule, with a few restrictions, at least for now.... this year looks to be a pretty strong lineup compared to recent years...https://www.ravinia.org/Calendarwhile the backlot bash *usually* isn't my cup of tea, this year has a decent lineup and may be worth checking out. looks to be a *go* for now...... also, it's FREE.https://www.backlotbash.com/music.htmland the goings-on in highwood seem to be on schedule, but things can change.........https://www.celebratehighwood.org/Edited: 1:30 pm, April 21, 2020 "
Covid isn’t going to peak until mid-May. This is going to affect Ravinia and lots of other events. My money says that stay-at-home will carry into June.
Ravinia isn't going to open.
"i don't see anything on their website that says it won't open...we shall see........................Edited: 5:55 pm, April 21, 2020 "
Lightfoot said today the stay at home order will likely extend into June. There won't be any large events this summer. Running of the Bulls and Octoberfest in Europe were already canceled.
Ravinia website has a covid 19 statement that says all events until june1 are cancelled and all donor ticket sales are suspended until they see how things develop. They aren’t going to open on time and will have cancelled events like everyone else.
"Chicago's PrideFest, June 20 and 21, has been postponed tentatively to Labor Day weekend, and the Pride Parade, June 28th, was also postponed to a date TBD.Lakeview will be extremely quiet this summer...."
They might as well just cancel all large events now.
"Trying to make everyone happy by goin week to week, month to month only confuses everybody. There will be no gathering until months after a vaccine is available to all."
Ravinia cancelled the entire season = https:/…
You beat me Dave lol
Totally sux cuz they had a pretty strong lineup this year....
Msmejkal told us about Ravinia on April 17th (post 17)
"""Msmejkal told us about Ravinia on April 17th (post 17)""Carlo - that was a prediction."
"Grant Park Music Festival has now cancelled their season as well, no great surprise really."
Pitchfork Music Festival is canceled.
This news is a few days old but for those who haven't heard Great America will not open this year.
"Sorry, I may have given out bad info, the website says they are temporarily closed, but several posts on Facebook said they will not open this year."
Nothing official from Great America but they are definitely a stage 5 so it's safe to assume they will not open this summer.
"This was announced a coupla weeks ago, but the winnetka music festival is also canceled. Same with the summer evening concert series at indepence grove in libertyville...."
"And the 2020 greater chicago jewish festival, held every even year, has been postponed till june 2021."
"For the first time in its 33-year history, Ribfest has been canceled due to health safety concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced Sunday night.https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ ... story.html"
"Radiologists group pulls November meeting — and 50,000 attendees — from Chicago.https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
Wisconsin State Fair is canceled for the first time since 1945.
We were speculating about the WI State Fair upthread in early April.
"The entire slate of city special summer events have been canceled through Sept. 7, or Labor Day, the city announced Friday, as the state and city continue to work to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Cancellations include the Chicago House Music Conference and Festival, Chicago Gospel Music Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Chicago SummerDance, Taste of Chicago, the Chicago Air and Water Show, Chicago Jazz Festival, as well as most of the summer programming at the Chicago Riverwalk, Chicago Cultural Center and in Millennium Park."
So does that include LollaPalooza scheduled for July?
“So does that include LollaPalooza scheduled for July?“ = that decision is supposed be announced next week.
Spoiler alert: Lolla will be cancelled. I will miss the people watching and wondering how one pees in a port-a-potty while wearing a romper/jumpsuit. Funny how I used to grumble about not being able to leave my apartment during it but now I kind crave the madness. I live between Michigan and Roosevelt. Summers and Bears seasons were crazy. Going to be a quiet one this year.
"""I wouldn’t go near Lolla but am going to miss it anyway. As well as the other festivals and events that make summer, summer. No buzz this year.""I've lived in Lakeview for nearly 40 years. I grouse perpetually about the traffic, crowds, noise, drunken revelers and endless summer festivals with accompanying street closures. I have often wished for those activities to be eliminated. Well, I got my wish and I think I too will miss some of it. Not the drunks, of course."
"Milwaukee Summerfest canceled for 2020, will resume in 2021. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
Chicago Race to Mackinac is canceled too.
I almost miss the Chicago traffic.......B.
"https://www.rsna.org/annual-meetingThe big radiologist conference in November has been cancelled, and will be a virtual one instead."
I work for a company of about 75K people. We have cancelled all conferences and large meeting through the first half of 2021.B.
"The International Manufacturing Technology Show, expected to bring more than 129,000 attendees to Chicago, canceled over coronavirus uncertainty."
What's up with Lolla? Is there a secret?
#53 - I think they are holding off until the insurance will kick in and then announce. I can’t see any scenarios where they could pull off a large festival.
"Lollapalooza is CancelledThe city also announced it is canceling all of its events through Labor Day, including Taste of Chicago, the Air and Water Show and the Chicago Jazz Festival to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment…"

"Square roots festival “postponed”, but the way things are going, i wouldn’’t doubt it if it’s canceled outright, like everything else........https://squareroots.org/"
"Within minutes of each other, Joffrey Ballet and Lyric Opera of Chicago both announced the cancellation of all performances through the end of December. This includes the very popular Joffrey ""Nutcracker"" at Christmastime. Not surprising, but sad."
I just got that email too CV. Joffrey is moving to the Lyric this year so the venue being closed would affect both. 3000 people 6 days a week for 4 months ? It wasn't going to happen.
By the Way: Word from NYC is that the Broadway Theaters will not open this year. Expect the same in Chicago.
Riot Fest says it’s 'postponing' the annual summer music festival until 2021 due to COVID-19.
Chris Jones posted that the Mercury Theatre won’t reopen. He’s on furlough this week so can’t write a piece on it.

Since the looting is still going on I’ve cancelled my trip next month.
Since COVID is still going on you shouldn't have planned a September visit in the first place. You read about the 14 Day Quarantine last July. https:/…107450994
The trip was planned 4 months ago.
Judy D - your post from July in the California forums:#3 of 14 ·I’m now convinced that until there is a ban on unnecessary travel people just will not stop. It’s sad there are so many thinking their need to travel doesn’t affect others.Please do follow your own advice and stay home during the pandemic. Your need for travel does affect us.
Just looking for a way to bring up the looting.
