"I've been there when one of these storms arrive and it's brutal. It seems to trap the hot air to the ground and for women, it is non-stop cleaning.https:/…"
Um...implying men can't (or won't) clean? It's not rocket science...
"Most Cuban men don't clean, cook, shop for food, take care of anything in the house except if it requires a tool. They are like it was in Canada 50 years ago, at least. My partner cleans the house. At first, the men in the neighbourhood would laugh at him and tell him that he was letting me boss him around. And the women were all asking me how I could convince him to clean."
"Bribe him with beer , rum and sex . Johnny C"
"You reach a man's heart is through his stomach. Helping with the house and cooking can result in some wonderful meals, etc.Otherwise it's beans and rice every day. Or maybe that's why it's beans and rice most days? LOL"
My friend in Holguin is complaining about as I type. She is saying it's really dusty.
It is like being under a sky of hazy dust. And it's hot. Had the aircon on for a couple of hours yesterday.
"At least, everyone is wearing a mask. But people with allergies and respiratory problems are told to stay home. The sky is weird and it's very hot, but we don't have it nearly as bad as the Oriente. We keep the house closed anyway, because I have sever allergies and not that many antihistaminic left."
"Spunky #4: I don't believe all Cuban women try to ""reach a man's heart is through his stomach."" I sense than many aim about 20 cm lower.Edited: 4:16 pm, June 23, 2020 "
Dust Storm from the Sahara reaches Caribbean (Cuba) & N. America. See pics in link att. An interesting read.https:/…
"@9) great comparison photos, thanks for the link."
"#8, Bob, Bragging about your abs again? LOL"
Similar to the cloud of dust in the gravel pit where I work on a hot dry day.
"Spunky, I was referring to some Cuban women's idea of the way to a man's heart not being through their stomach but another part of the body which is below the waist line. Think of the ""Cuban favorite sport"" which is not baseball. I try to steer comments away from things like abs because too many know me personally,. No room to brag there."
But are they going for his heart or his wallet?
Holais that a trick question.....door no. #2 for sure....cheers.
@2 Hmm... That's strange. Male servers at the resorts seem to be very attentive and eager to please and always clean up promptly... at least my table :))
"@9 OMG, I hope the cloud doesn't bring Ebola or something: we don't need that on top of COVID-19"
Talk about shake and bake.Not sure how good they can bake it but straight up they sure know how to shake it.

There is an article in Times today re dust storm from Sahara. Someone call d it dessert poo.
"Just had a look outside, the sun looks like a 40 watt bulb, guess I'm gonna get some fertilized dust on the garden.Just under 36c yesterday, not looking forward to today."
"In Santiago, it is worse today than yesterday.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sahara-du…"
OMG! I hope you're ok and staying inside.
"Gen - indoors all day yesterday and today. Been up to the roof to take pictures for comparison. The mountains are barely visible today.I've changed my profile pic temporarily, compare it to my cover photo - same shot on a normal day."
"Thanks for the pictures! The sky is heavy and yellow/grey here, but nothing like that. Stay safe st home, and hopefully it will leave tomorrow or the day after. There will be lots of washing and cleaning to do during the week end! :-("
"People from Puerto Rico ,the Cayman Islands, St. Lucia , Jamaica , etc are all saying about how bad it is. Supposed to cover much of Central America and Mexico by tomorrow, then moving into Texas, then East to the South and Mid Atlantic states for the weekend. Huge area."
"That would be a real mess, just imagine the cleanup after....not to mention hard to breathe."
