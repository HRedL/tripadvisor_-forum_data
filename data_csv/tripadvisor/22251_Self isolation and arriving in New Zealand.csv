"Hello, I am an Australian citizen leaving to live in New Zealand on Friday. I cannot reschedule as I have a job and home in the country already set up. What are the current requirements / restrictions I will be facing? Do I need to write down my isloation plan to prove I will not put any one at risk? Sorry, this is my 2nd time travelling ever and I want to ensure as smooth of a ride as possible."
"Read the official guidelines so you can prepare and on arrival, tell what you will do to comply https:/…covid-19-self-isolation"
You are interviewed at the airport. If your plans meet the rewuirement you are good to go and you must self isolate for 14 days.If not I guess you head for home.
Which city are you flying into?Which city is your job/new home in?Is your new home self-contained? If ye then you shouldn’t have a problem. Countdown is one of the major supermarket chains wh should be able to do delivery. Have you discussed your needs with your new employer? Mental health is going to be your biggest problem without friends/family to help you out. Male sure you have the Healthline number - I suspect they’ll give you that at the airport.
"I fly into Christchurch and will be living and working in Timaru. I will be living with 2 other people but we have all thoroughly discussed self-isolation to ensure I am not contaminating them. (like cooking / leaving my room as they are at work and sanitising all the surface I touch, plus lots of hand washing!). Both their work places have also agreed that the steps I plan on taking are adequate and there should be no issue with coming into their workplaces. I have and my employer is fine as it is required of me to stay in the country. I have plans on trying to keep a semi-regular schedule to ensure I feel as normal. :)I have all the important contacts written to, just incase!"
"It sounds like you are well prepared Brie, so well done for taking it all seriously. As I understand it you should just need to explain all that at the border if necessary, and have your self isolation address ready to list for them. Check the official advice though."
"Brie, sounds like you're being very sensible and proactive -ka pai - good stuff. I'm sure you've read through all the guidelines - the Health Department website has good info. https:/…covid-19-self-isolation"
