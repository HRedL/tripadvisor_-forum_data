"I don't want to ask a question, but after seeing the rescue efforts on Bell Rock last night, I do want to caution anyone hiking to be prepared. Make sure you are off the trails by dusk, and be prepared with water, sweatshirts, flashlights, etc. should you find yourself in a sticky situation. These may look like easy trails, but if you are not familiar with them, they can still be challenging. Those search and rescue folks deserve all our respect for endangering themselves to rescue others."
What happened last night? Did they find the person and were they stuck down on a ledge after dark? ...Was watching the helicopter and hoping that someone had not fallen. Thanks for your post!
"take a loud whistle, they might not be able to see you or your light, but they will be able to hear you,Edited: 6 years ago "
"A whistle sounds good. The helicopter was out there for several hours, and I think rescue workers may have been walking people down off the rock, but so far nobody seems to know the real story."
I hope the tourists paid their fair share to the rescue squad and helicopter company for their time and trouble! Stupidity is epidemic these days. Good tips Jpad108! Thanks for your reply! :)
I have searched the news sources but found nothing about last night's Bell Rock search/ rescue. I am not even certain that the hikers were rescued without harm. This is valuable info for travelers. I'd think it an appropriate topic?
