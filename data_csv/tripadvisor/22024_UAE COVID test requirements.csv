"Just in case anyone is going through the UAE (not just Dubai on Emirates).http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302857374Seems you have to use a specific lab in order to get the approved results, even if transiting."
"Hello MjonisAs this is such a contentious issue I think it is important that understanding is correct.If you are specifically transiting through UAE you do not require a UAE Covid test. Transiting could take as little as 90 minutes and to raise concern in peoples minds that they need to change planes and have a test in that timescale is incorrect.If you are successful in having arrived to the UAE and are now transiting then you will have already produced all of the documentation you require to complete the transit stage. Before you boarded the flight in your originating country you will have already shown a negative Covid test result - that is all that is required and you will not need a new Covid test if you are just passing through the UAE as a transit passenger.Further, if you are meaning that a passenger has to use a specific lab in their home country to be able to transit in UAE - that is also incorrect. The only countries which have specific labs named by the UAE authorities are those on the Higher Risk list. For the UK for instance, there are named labs but you do not have to use those as the UK is not on the Higher Risk list.ThanksRichard from PurelyMaldives"
"Thanks Richard.The article (which could be wrong, it's only from the news, LOL) clearly states TRANSITING, which is different from your information.""he UAE has announced that COVID-19 test will be mandatory for all inbound and *transit* passengers, including Emiratis, residents, and tourists, arriving via the country's airports, irrespective of the countries they are coming from. ""But if you have a link to something official that contradicts/corrects, that would be useful to folks as well, I'd think.You may also want to look at this thread, since it seems that Etihad anyway, requires a specific company called PureHealth.https:/…2022376-covid-test-required.htmlAlthough things seem to change daily, unfortunately.:("
"The Emirates flyertalk forum seems to have substantially more information, along with links to the various publications. Seems pretty clear that transit passengers are affected (as of 8/1), and certain labs need to be used if from certain countries. https://gulfnews.com/uae/health/coronavirus-…But again, everything seems in flux.https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/emirates-sky…See post 31 specifically for a nice detailed list from Emirates website.Edited: 1:21 pm, July 28, 2020 "
The advice for the UAE has changed to match the criteria for travelling to and through Dubai. With effect from 1st August it now also applies to Abu Dhabi.https:/…united-arab-emiratesThis can also be seen on the FCO travelaware Facebook page.
"WAM is the official government news agency, so would hope it is accurate!"
"Pretty clear on Emirates website: you need a negative tests done within 96h prior to departure. https:/…This leads to some other issues as they take into consideration only results done at some laboratories and for UK not the NHS test (for which by the way you only receive a SMS with the result). Then the labs seems to only work Mon to Fri and they say that the results are issued within 48h. If you fly on a Sunday this might be an issue. Then you also need a test on return - will that be done at the resort or do you have to go to Male for it? Arghhh, hope by December the things will be clearer and more we’ll have worldwide, streamlined rules, guidelines and procedures.Edited: 2:00 pm, July 28, 2020 "
Currently there are no approved testing facilities in the Maldives.https://screening.purehealth.ae/application
"I spoke with Emirates last night with regard to transit.You must present a negative covid test valid 96 hours from the time of the swab when you board for Dubai (in my case, at JFK).If you are transiting thru Dubai and never leave the airport, then you can board your transit flight without a 2nd test even if it has been more than 96 hours since your original covid test.If you are from certain countries or areas of a country, you may be subject to a 2nd test at the airport."
"Unfortunately NHS tests are not available for international travelhttps:/…4465There are several private pure health approved clinics in the UK with tests costing around £120I also note the FCO update states no air travel to Abu Dhabi, I didn't see that coming. I have flights booked with Etihad in October so hope the advice changes."
"If you carefully read the requirements, it says IF a certain testing labs is required, then you must use it.NO certain testing labs are REQUIRED for the Maldives, therefore you can use whatever facility is available, provided it is a register physician or lab."
"Sorry the links didn't seem to work, here they are againhttps:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/499/nove…"
"As information, the WHO helped build a lab at Indira Ghandi hospital in Male so covid tests can be processed there."
Hi - where did you get your test done in NY?
i recently did a test in NY through the 'approved' state testing center and received results after 5 days. how do you ascertain receiving results within 96 hours?
"what if you're going to the Maldives transiting through UAE and can present a negative COVID from the US within 96 hoursBUTIf you're flying from the Maldives back to the US and transit through UAE., what is the expectation regarding where to get tested for transit through."
"@linhie, you will need to organise the COVID test for the return journey with your resort. They all have different arrangements and most seem to be chargeable. They seem to be carried out in resort then the sample sent for testing."
