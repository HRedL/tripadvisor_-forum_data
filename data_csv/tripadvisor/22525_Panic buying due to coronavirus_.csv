Is there panic buying causing grocery shortages due to coronavirus?
"Hi Eric. So far no ""panic buying"" in the way you've seen in the news. But yes people have started to stockpile on goods since schools will be closed starting Monday (16/03) and children will be staying at home till further notice. . Cheers"
