"This time of year many Goa regulars book for next season, I have usually booked mine by now, I haven’t booked yet but that was because we couldn’t decide whether to go to Kerala for a week before going to Goa for 3 weeks, now I just feel like I don’t want to book in these uncertain times.I just wonder in these uncertain times if people are holding off making a booking until later in the year , by which time it should be much clearer if it will be ok to travel to India?"
"Just too early for us to book as we normally wait for Emirates to release flights for our dates Shirley. Think this year we'll be the same as you and wait to see how things pan out. Got Cyprus booked for May , that is now looking unlikely to happen."
"It would be a good idea to wait a bit to see how the Covid 19 progression goes for a few months.I would not be booking to go to China or Italy for at least a year, but lot of new countries being added to the list now, Spain, France who knows who next.If at all I do book anything I'd make sure they offer 100% free cancellation in the T&C"
"I guess it’s just a waiting game yorkietourer , we have Greece booked for May but will be very surprised if that goes ahead :("
"We booked flights with Air India about 6 weeks ago for November, booked direct with Air India using a credit card so will be covered if it goes belly up.Had a week booked in Lanzorte for May can’t see that happening so again money back via CC."
"We would normally have booked by now but not even thinking of it at the moment, who knows how long this will last and what effects it will have, what airlines will be still up and running next year."
"booked Qatar for jan and feb 2021, hope to get to Goa as our other hols booked for 2020 are now looking unlikely"
Just hoping the site we keep our Caravan on is allowed to stay open as it looks like that's where we'll be for our holidays this year Shirley.
I have reserved our room but am holding off booking the flights until visas are reinstated. I'm not sure if we would be covered if they are not back in operation by the time we would be due to fly. We were booked for Greece in May but that looks highly unlikely.
"Here at the moment. Shacks are being dismantled. Beach is deserted. Locals are staying indoors. Panic buying has started. Rumours that delivery of veg and supplies will be stopped at Goan borders. Restaurants very empty. Hand gel used in hotel breakfast bar is the one they use in the morgues!! Oman Air has stopped flying from Doha to Goa. Hoping our charter flight will get us home on whatever date, we don’t know yet."
"Guest house reserved, just waiting for the flights to come online, so all being well we'll be back."
Flights booked wit Tui for late December. Accommodation booked too. Hoping things will calm down by them. BOB...….
"our friends ,have just stopped and the Santana beach, and have booked all ready for next march £35pn, now they will have to keep checking flight prices"
"We booked as soon as we got back on 1st March, flying with Qatar next February. We have annual travel insurance with travel disruption etc, so are fully covered. Hopefully things will have settled down by next year, but in all honesty I think it will be touch and go.We book our accommodation while we are away, so that’s all in place.Edited: 2:50 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"What is this obsession with booking a year in advance already? For accomodation, if you are a regular guest, you never have a problem getting a place. Maybe a month before i travel, i send a message when i would arrive. And since i normally book my flights only two weeks in advance, i always say: plus/minus a few days. I update a few few days before i come.That never ever has been a problem. ""Worst"" thing ever happened, i got put up in an even better place, while i had to wait for my regular one to become available.It just seems weird to me, to book flights a year in advance and accomodation. My experience is, that you get far better deals, if you simply wait.Some better place might come up in that year, which you could rent instead, if you remain flexible. And a lot of airlines have not even made a plan yet, where and when they fly in 12 months. So you miss out on a lot of special offers that come up, when the other airlines do. Later in the year.In my opinion you waste a lot of money if you book so far in advance. Met quite some people arounde here, superhappy about how clever they are, doing that, and when hearing what they pay, i am polite enough not to ruin their joy, but they could have gotten the flight and accomodation chepaer, if they just would have waited. But anonymous as his here is and not worried about hurting some personal aquaintances' feelings, you really should rethink this one year in advance strategy. It is not a good one."
Booked for next feb hope it's all sorted by then.
"Manfred e the lowest prices for Scheduled airlines are usually 9 to 10 months before your holidays. For the last five years we've paid less than £450 to fly to Goa. Before that used to fly with Qatar and pay £600 to £700. Leaving things until the last minute sometimes pays off providing you don't have specific dates or requirements. Who knows what will happen this year. Don't think things will follow their usual course.Edited: 5:35 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Manfred eObviously you've never booked a scheduled flight to Goa/India from the UKOur flights booked as soon as they came out were £532 a month before travel they were £900.I've read your advice and will choose to ignore it as you've clearly had too much honeybee.Edited: 5:51 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"What a load of tosh. Either book while in goa or as early as possible when we get home. Flying with Qatar, again, next January. £980 for the 2 of us out of Birmingham, you wouldn't get that price nearer the time. Deposit paid on the room, all sorted. Everything on the back burner but all insured"
"My travel insurance company , insure and go will not cover any bookings made after 13th March . I would check your insurance company and credit card company prior to booking as many are following this advice."
"Some people like the certainty of booking early or/and have a set period when they can go, others like to take the risk. I was of the opinion that the best flight prices were around eight weeks before leaving, but I note that some people are getting flights a lot cheaper than me.As for booking for next year, I don't think I will be considering it at all until we all know more about the current situation and I doubt if we will really know until at least Xmas. Also, if one was to book now, knowing that there is currently a travel ban, I'm not sure how this would affect travel insurance; it would be worth asking your'e provider before booking."
"We booked separate flights and hotel for next season before we came out for this season, just because we could get good flight prices and in the exact accommodation we wanted . We'll just have to wait and see what happens, but fingers crossed we will get back there. Both are flexible, so maybe we can move back a month or two if necessary."
Booked flights for the beginning of November via Air India as have been invited to a wedding. If they get cancelled they get cancelled. Wasn't planning to go this year but the invite was from someone I like and respect so decided to go if I can. Cost for flights just over £600.
"We are not going to book any flights for next season yet. It's just too much of a risk. I doubt very much that existing travel insurance policies would pay out if you couldn't fly, as you'd have booked knowing that there is probability this could happen. On the other hand if things do improve and restrictions are lifted, I would expect that cash strapped airlines (if still alive) will be clamoring for business and fares should be quite competitive.Air India is one of the airlines that may well be in very serious trouble (it was in dire straits, before coronavirus)"
You'll probably be okay Ned with travel insurance if the situation has not sorted itself out before you go.
"I'm not so sure he will be covered. But happy to be proved wrong. I would say it all depends on exactly when his insurance policy expires and when exactly he booked the flights.From Moneysavingexpert information.........- ""If you have a holiday booked but no insurance, then sadly it's likely too late. We don't know of any policies offering cover for coronavirus-caused cancellations and claims, and even if you have an annual policy, most are now excluding coronavirus cover for newly-booked trips.""Article - https:/…insurersSo what I'm saying is, if the trip is after you insurance renewal date, then you may not be covered for coronavirus affected travel."
"You are correct IA in so far as if there was no insurance in place when the travel was booked; I assumed the insurance was in place or may be covered with a rolling bank type insurance, if the travel was booked before the current situation.I personally will not be booking anything until this situation is fully known. And I very much doubt if we are really going to know the overall picture very much before Xmas."
"I paid the remaining £250 deposit with TUI today for CSM in November/December. IIRC they split the deposit in two, one payment on booking the second some time later. That sometime later was today. I believe if I had NOT paid and tried to cancel they would still have chased me for the second half of the deposit. Between a rock and a hard place really.If I read it correctly Money Savings Expert informed people (like me I suppose) that it would be better to pay for holidays already booked outside the current FCO no-fly period rather than cancel. I certainly wouldn't want to have had to pay the second part of the deposit and then cancel only to find out later on that the FCO also included the period of my holiday, where I would have had a full refund.Of course I really want the holiday."
"Manfred e. I've booked my flight early for one reason and one reason only. That is because we want a direct flight to Goa with no stopovers. This at the moment is only available with Tui. These flights will sell out quite quickly. Our beach accommodation is desirable an lots of people try to book it before us but we have a standing order with the vendor. We all have different reason's for what we do. BOB......Edited: 3:17 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Good luck BBLM, keep up the good work!"
"We have annual insurance, so we were covered when we booked. But as people are saying, the Ts & Cs may well change when we renew the policy . We have a Jet2 holiday in May paid for that I believe we will get our money back on. Thornhill lass goes the week before us, and has been offered a refund. And we have to pay for a Tui June holiday this week. Like MMS, if we cancel now we will lose our deposit, so I think it's best to pay, then see if we can defer the holiday to next year."
Just been on my Nationwide app and there's a note about travel insurance and Carona virus. Basically they are saying bookings made before 18th March are covered but any made on or after will not be covered as it was then a known event.
"Yes, that seems about right Yorkie."
"Yes - that's why we aren't booking anything yet.From my insurance provider - ""Any new policy purchased, after midday 13/03/2020, will not cover any cancellation claim in relation to Coronavirus, including but not limited to, cancellation due to your diagnosis of Coronavirus, FCO advice or flights being cancelled.""My existing policy will cover me up to the beginning of October. But if I book flights for mid Oct then I don't expect my new policy to cover meEdited: 10:11 am, March 19, 2020 "
"We are cautious about booking just yet.Goa is virus free at the moment possibly due to the high temperatures ,but waiting to see if they get affected once the monsoon season starts.With all the spitting that goes on it’s bound to spread."
"""then see if we can defer the holiday to next year.""I'd be cautious Ned…… would you be accepting a ""credit"" in lieu of the holiday?When TC went bust a lot of people had had credits from TC for one reason or another, flight delays being one of them. Some had accepted an inflated price relative to the money they would have received if they used the credit against another holiday.When TC collapsed , those credit were worthless.If I were in your shoes, I'd accept a full refund and book again. Unfortunately, phoning TUI for advice isn't always the best choice - speak to two agents and get three different opinions.What ever you do I hope you make the right choice."
I can certainly agree with your sentiments concerning Tui. I have something going through ABTA at the moment concerning 4 different representative all giving me differing advice concerning the same subject.
"we booked Qatar with a credit card for Jan-Feb 21, our apartment booked with the same card via Airbnb for the month,in fact the only thing we have not paid for is the taxi fares between airport - apartment-airport as we are watching to see if the taxi app works properly."
"We booked for December. Never usually book so far in advance but really wanted to go to Seashell Suites in Candolim as it has such fantastic reviews and sells out quickly. So far only paid the first part of the deposit with TUI - next part of deposit due mid April. We are going to pay and keep hope things are sorted before then. At worst we will have only lost £500 pounds - if things are still bad then, we have a lot more than that to worry about!"
"Good point MMS, but you have to hope Tui are big enough not to go under. It depends on what they offer I suppose. They are already saying we can move the holiday, but haven't mentioned refunds or credits yet.Edited: 6:55 am, March 21, 2020 "
"This is the opinion of someone living here.Please hold off committing your money to deposits for next season's holidays. Rumours around north goa are that a lot of hotels & guest houses won't survive this pandemic, many are not generating enough funding to service bank loans and pay normal service charges, many are no longer able to pay staff. The government is struggling to provide basic service's and may be forced to curtail road & other projects post the virus & monsoon.If they go under & you have booked independently then your deposit or fees may be lost. If you book through tui, you most likely will be allocated another hotel, but possibly with further charges.Hold off a few months, we may get back to normal quickly we may not.Many I know are worried that season 2020/21 may be poor, these are the same goans throwing foreigners & domestics out of their hotels & guest houses.The true side of the smiling assassions is now being displayed."
"In addition to what I suggested.A couple of domestic airlines in India may not survive this lockdown..Goair were instructed by the government of India to continue to pay staff salaries throughout the crisis , the CEO of the company came out on wednesday and said, he could even pay staff till the end of March.The RBI has announced that growth for India is now expected to be 2.5% for the year against the previous 5.3% indicated... funding for industry was announced nothing for airlines or tourism.It may be that Indians are encouraged to get back to work after the virus is hopefully defeated but will they be encouraged to take holidays."
"Good posts SG and as always, businesses and people that provide services are not your friends they are businesses and their aim is purely to make profit and without profit they don't survive. Smiling is all part of the ""business"". I will not be going anywhere or paying out any of my hard earned money, in the vague hope of going somewhere until this situation is (as best as we can tell) over.Stay well, stay safe."
"Good post (43). It’s not intended to be a swipe at Goa because I like the place, I first visited 35 years ago and have returned since. ‘Smiling’ is all part of the business and in India the rupee trumps everything. In the Caribbean they have a saying for the tourists, normally the cruise ships coming into port...’White Gold’. It’s the same the world over and even in the U.K. tourist destinations. The problem is that some tourists actually believe it when they are made to feel special...money is always the main motive for that. I know it’s not romantic and it sounds harsh but that’s the reality of travel."
"I agree RedRover, I had some great fun with some of the people in Jamaica, especially the trick where they take you into a large open market with the intention of getting you lost and confused before demanding money to lead you out to ""safety"".Stay well, stay safe.Edited: 6:13 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Good advice in post 41, I have been thinking along the same lines of who will survive this. Businesses are being propped up in the UK but even then surely many will go. Its so sad but we are not thinking we will be going anywhere next year we will keep the hope that our sons wedding in Australia will go ahead in 2022 instead of the previously planned 2021."
"I have a holiday to Greece in May which I am hoping I will get my money back for. I've already cancelled a holiday in the UK. I won't be booking anything else until the situation improves because it seems pointless when we don't know if the holiday companies and airlines are going to survive all this. Anyway, there might not be holidays for a while if our family need help financially until the Government start their payments to those who can no longer work. I'd rather use our holiday savings for them then book to go away.Edited: 7:59 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Yes, it's madness to gamble on booking any holiday in the current climate.Keep well, stay safe."
Yourkietourer..My niece has a Caravan Skegness way. My sister in law who has heart conditions and her daughter have had to return home to the Midlands this week by Train..a 4 hour journey with stops..They had no choice and she was terrified having to use the train.They both felt safer staying put than coming back to their own town ...
"We have flights booked already for January..My partner has annual worldwide travel insurance for our dates.However I am only covered up to May with the same company and my insurance is Europe and nearer to home..I can see come May my insurance premiums rising quite a lot,,"
Do you think there will be a next season?
I can’t see the Travel industry being back on track anytime in the next 12 months. We booked Qatar flights In February for November 2020 on Credit card. So hopefully if Qatar cancel flights we will get a refund.
