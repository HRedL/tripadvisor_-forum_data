hi has anyone read about the current dengue fever epidemic? sounds quite severe- heading to bolivia on the 13th april and was wondering whether it affects me in La Paz. 
There are very few cases of dengue in La Paz although there have been a few. Dengue is caused by the same mosquitoe that spreads yellow fever. You need a yellow fever vaccination to get into Bolivia. I posted about the dengue outbreak here: boliviabella.com/emergency-measures-for-dengâ€¦There are very few mosquitoes in La Paz. I don't think you have to worry.
