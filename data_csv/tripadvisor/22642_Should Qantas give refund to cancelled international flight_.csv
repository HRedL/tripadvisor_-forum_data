"Since Qantas cancelled their international flights until May, has anyone been able to get refund for the cancelled flight? My flight is in early April. What I heard is that Qantas only gives credit for cancelled flight. But I am worried that I will not be able to use the credit in next couple of years. The busy work/life schedule or health may not allow me to plan another international travel in near future. And then the credit will be totally wasted. Per Qantas policy, ""you will be entitled to a refund if we are unable to carry you and you have a confirmed reservation"". So should Qantas give refund, in stead of credit for the cancelled flight?"
"Yes, they should refund. Like all airlines they try it on for providing a credit but if they have declined to carry you at the date and time booked you are entitled to a refund."
"And for Qantas it is procedurally easier to give a 'credit' as they have all the details there on file - giving back refunds involves bank accounts or credit cards which would probably need to be confirmed with you before being processed (and all airlines are overwhelmed with work at the moment).Edited: 5:01 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"""What I heard is that Qantas only gives credit for cancelled flight""Per Qantas: ""Customers may also be able to cancel their booking and request a refund, however they may be charged a cancellation fee, as per our fare rules.""The fact that you are not guaranteed a refund is due to the fact that your booking doesn't guarantee you a flight on the day selected.Note the full credit for another flight will expire after 12 months, not after a couple of years. Its not an ideal situation, but no-one is saying it is."
Have you had an email from Qantas about what is happening? Did you purchase direct from the airline because that will make a difference.
"Per Qantas: ""Customers may also be able to cancel their booking and request a refund, however they may be charged a cancellation fee, as per our fare rules.""I think this rule of cancellation with cancellation fee only apply, if the passenger cancel the flight voluntarily.In my case, Qantas cancelled the flight themselves."
I purchased the flight ticket through travel agent. And my travel agent told me that Qantas only provides credit for the cancelled flight. :(
"Under normal circumstances the travel agent refunds you, after all you paid them, not Qantas."
"The ACCC have ratified that in these exceptional circumstances a full refund in the form of credit is acceptable. The only way you will get a full refund in 'cash' is if you have a fully flexible ticket. All other refunds are subject to cancellation feesEdited: 5:57 pm, March 19, 2020 "
">>And then the credit will be totally wasted. <<If you get the chance to speak to someone from Qantas, perhaps ask about a credit for use with another airline in the OneWorld alliance. That night be more useful for you to use across the US."
Just to confirm ... if you booked through a travel agent you need to contact them ... it's extremely clearly explained here ... https://www.qantas.com/au/en/travel-info/tra…
"The credit has to be used on a Qantas ticket, however the flight can be operated by a codeshare airline."
"Hi, I have a Qantas ticket bought via SKIDDOO. It is an absolute nightmare dealing with them. I called Qantas. Qantas said I have to deal with Skiddoo. According to Qantas, I should be getting a full refund. But the agent is saying that there is an cancellation fee $783.28 and an agent cancellation fee of $133. The ticket was supposed to have been cancelled on 13/03. I received an email from them today 13/04 saying ticket has not been cancelled. It will take a further 15 weeks for refund or credit back from Qantas. But the credit can only be used via Skiddo rather than I can book directly with Qantas without going through SKIDDOO. Dealing with the agent is an nightmare. I am unable to call them and can only communicate via emails which take a long time for them to reply. Would Qantas acknowledge this email ASAP and I can deal directly with Qantas for the refund or credit. So that I can book directly with Qantas again rather than dealing with this NIGHTMARE SKIDDO AGENT."
"If you booked through an agent, you have to get the refund through the agent, and you are subject to the agent's terms and fees."
"If the flight was to a US airport, Qantas is bound by U.S. Dept. of Transportation regulations which require a full refund of price paid if the airline cancels the flight for any reason and the passenger chooses not to accept an alternate offer (such as a credit). Now your travel agent may take fees (I don't know the rules on that), but Qantas can't deny you a refund if that's what you prefer."
"OP from New York did say they used a travel agent, but a different poster, from Melbourne, was the one that used Skidoo. Not every agent is the same. And no matter what Qantas says their coronavirus policy is, they are still bound by US D.o.T. regulations for flights involving U.S. airports."
Like you i had a flight booked in early April . The government had issued a warning to Australians not to travel around mid March from memory. I would have expected Qantas ro issue immediate refund. OH NO.They said in my case you HAD to apply for a credit by 31 st of March even thought the flight was not due to leave until early April if i wanted a refund. Nothing about cancelling the flight. So they were asking people to accept a credit before the flight was cancelled. While in reality they should have issued refund as soon as the the government said don't travel.I feel like i have been conned
<< I would have expected Qantas ro issue immediate refund. >> your expectations are not Qantas policy.
"tilt10 - What was the destination of your ticket? If outside Australia, other policies might apply, and might be more passenger-friendly, assuming Qantas eventually canceled any of the flights."
RKCa ... can you provide a link or further info about that US cancellation law please ... I cannot find anything about it anywhere. Thanks.

"The US rule is a DOT regulation for flights by US carriers not sure if it pertains for tickets sold in the US by foreign carriers https:/…refundsEdited: 11:08 am, April 14, 2020 "
DoT regs Definitely apply to non-US carriers for flights that include US airports. Very clearly stated in the regulations.
"Here’s a link to the exact U.S. DOT Enforcement Notice. As previously mentioned, it requires all airlines, domestic and international, to promptly refund fares for flights which they cancel or substantially delay. It does not, however, apply when the customer cancels the flight. (This notice applies to flights booked for flights from the U.S.)https:/…enforcement_notice_refunds_apr_3_2020"
"I have read this document ... there is not a lot of clarity over international flights ... I assume flights booked outside the US don't come under this regulation, it's not very clear."
"It doesn't matter where you were when you booked, if directly with the airline. It matters whether a US airport is involved. Both to AND from (as well as within) US. Seems very clear to me!"
"""The Department’s rules regarding flight delays and cancellations apply only to flights that operate to, from, or within the United States. """
"While the US Government might have policy , it would really come down to are they prepared to in force it ?So I buy a Ticket ,say from Qantas web site in Australia , to Fly SYD-LAX return,then they can it and say here is voucher, So I get upset and go to the US Government are they going to act ? If so they have two courses of Action if Qantas does not comply to refund. 1) They could fine Qantas. 2) they could Take away landing rights .However, yes the US Government might act if that Ticket was Purchased from say United from a US based web site. So the question remains, how often does the US Government apply the rule.Good Luck, I am glad I currently have no trips booked."
Qantas cancelled my return flight back from Manila to AucklandI am stuck in the Philippines and Qantas emailed me a credit voucher- nil value !!When I get back to NZ I am going to file a civil claim against Qantas NZ the office I booked online with.These cowboys need to be held accountable even in covid-19 times. Qantas has had good years recently and should have been more prudent with their cash-smaller shareholdividends for example.
"I’m sorry to hear this. As you say it is unforgivable. I think there are a number of people who would like to sue Qantas to recover cash paid for flights cancelled by Qantas, but the amounts involved are relatively small in comparison to the cost and trouble of litigation. I think it is worth while investigating the possibility of a group acting together. We may find a lawyer who is willing to take on a claim for a group on the basis of no win, no fee. I will put out feelers to some lawyers. Let me know if you (or anyone else) is interested in participating"
"Our consumer protection agency - ACCC - has ruled that a voucher is an acceptable substitute for a cash refund.If the airlines had to make cash refunds for all tickets, then even Qantas would go broke. The ACCC feels that this would not be in the best long-term interests of consumers."
"I can find no record of any such ruling. Can you please provide a link to it, or at least a media reference that would enable me to trace the ruling?"
"Thanks. The advice you have referred to does not actually say that a voucher is an acceptable form of compensation. It says ""If your travel is cancelled the ACCC expects that consumers will receive a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note or voucher, in most circumstances. In some cases, consumers will have the right to receive a refund, rather than a credit note or voucher. For example, you may be entitled to a refund under the terms and conditions of your ticket.”Qantas Conditions of Carriage provide13.1 When a Refund is AvailableYou will be entitled to a refund if we:• are unable to carry you and you have a confirmed reservation• delay your flight to the extent that you have to cancel your travel• make a Significant Change to the scheduled flight time, and we are unable to book you on an alternative flight which is acceptable to you ..., or• cancel your flight and we cannot offer you suitable alternative arrangements.In these circumstances we will provide a refund on request as set out in 13.2.This clause is subject to 2.4. You may have rights to remedies under the Australian Consumer Law.13.2 What Refund is Available?Where a refund is payable in accordance with these Conditions of Carriage, unless otherwise specified in these Conditions of Carriage the refund will be equal to:• the fare paid, if no part of the Ticket is used• alternatively, if part of the Ticket is used, the difference between the fare paid and the fare that would have been payable if booked for the travel taken,including any taxes and carriers charges, less any applicable fees.”It seems to me pretty clear that where Qantas cancel, they must refund unless suitable alternative compensation is available. A voucher for the value of the ticket will very rarely be suitable compensation from the point of view of the customer eg someone who is stranded in Manilla or has lost a planned holiday etc.The ACCC certainly does not say anything about the importance of Qantas to the Australian economy or similar."
">>The ACCC certainly does not say anything about the importance of Qantas to the Australian economy or similar<<That was in the media comment at the time the ruling was made. Australia has already had one major airline (Virgin) call go into administration. The regional airline Rex is just hanging on with government subsidies. Qantas is losing millions of dollars. Personally, I put the survival of the airlines as having a higher priority than you getting a cash refund."
"The ACCC isn't the arbiter. But their advice certainly makes it look like they aren't going to take up the baton in the Australian context.I'd be surprised if some sort of legal case doesn't eventuate. And there are some interesting legal points to be tested. In particular it's arguable that many of these contracts were frustrated.Meanwhile, have you contacted Qantas and demanded a refund? In the case of #39 who were ready and able to fly on a particular day and particular flight which the airline then cancelled, I think the case for a refund is particularly strong - if they didn't reroute you.When they have cancelled another flights where the passenger would have been equally unable to fly as the airline was to operate the flight, it's a different story. It's nobody's fault, and the event was unforeseen at the time of making the contract."
"Even if you get a refund you May not see it for 3+ months.I cancelled my bookings due to cancelled flights on April 1st and still haven’t received a refund.This is totally unethical.Consumers will remember, Qantas."
"FFS I can't believe some of the comments being made. Why is it ""unforgiveable"" that Qantas has cancelled international flights? Seriously?! And you want to sue the company or cancelling your flight? All I can say is go for it!I had booked a Qantas flight from Rome to Sydney 19 June. Operated by Emirates, it was cancelled. Rebooked for 1 July, no problem. Flight cancelled. Rebooked for 2 July. Flight cancelled. Was offered a rebooking for 19 July but opted to cancel my ticket for a refund. No problem. Now booked on Qatar. Will I sue Qantas/Emirates for cancelling my flight 3 times? Ah, no. There's this thing called a pandemic and another thing called border closures. I will get my refund and I will be recredited my FF points. I know both will take time, but I guess others think otherwise should be the case. In the meantime I don't mind forking out for the second ticket. These are difficult times for fliers AND the airlines."

We heard a few days ago that Qantas is now giving refunds. We were given credits for fares to South Africa in May. We would like a REFUND now. Has anyone had luck in contacting Qantas about this? Can you enlighten me please?Many thanks
We have been approved a refund a few days Ago with up to 10 weeks for the money to be returned to our account. We did not already negotiate a credit though.
