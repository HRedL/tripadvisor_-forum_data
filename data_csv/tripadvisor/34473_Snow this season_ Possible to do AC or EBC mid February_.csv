"I've read about the Avalanche - do you think there will be the possibility to do the AC or EBC or will it be closed?I'm pretty well used to hike in alpine snow conditions - and also pretty fit (no problem to do 3000-4000m altitude up AND down in one day at elevations up to 3000m (usual hiking speed in European Alps around 800m altitude per hour up, 1200m down with daypack, 25% faster up for trailrunning - so If I deduct 30% for altitude, and again 30% for speed I can still easily do the day distances even with 30-40cm soft snow). I also know I don't need acclimatisation before sleeping above 4000m (e.g. flight to La Paz then same day continue to still higher altitudes departing from sea level without any problems) - so I can cope with the eventual snowfall and harder conditions. Of course if there is strong snowfall even with Garmin GPS and track plotted out I most likely will sit it out (especially as without view avalanche danger cannot be assessed at all).I'm just considering if I should book a flight to Kathmandu (arrive 11. Feb, leave 5. March). I don't only want to do low altitude treks."
"Book the tickets for the dates you mentioned. You are extremely unlikely to have snow be an insurmountable obstacle to completing the EBC trek; it is a trek up and down valleys, and is a veritable trekking superhighway. Plenty of other trekkers, often in large groups replete with guides and porters, will be trodding the same path as you.Granted, a blizzard could throw a wrench in your plans, but that’s a risk year round. But then so is food poisoning. I wouldn’t let fear of either of them keep me from trekking EBC.I’ve never trekked in the Annapurna region. If you want to be as close as possible to Nepal’s highest mountains, choose EBC over the AC. And if you are feeling fit and fine, consider doing the Everest Three Passes Trek.Edited: 1:26 pm, January 25, 2020 "
"Thanks, that's good to know. I will go solo (or join up with others in the trail) so just hope to have a 90percent chance for either of the treks (and some side trips if no snow storm arrives)."
"It’s impossible to say what the weather will be doing in the High Himalaya’s in 2 ½ weeks’ time – As above has posted, there is a reasonable chance that you will be able to do either trek without too many problems - But it can also happen that there is another dump of snow that would at least slow you downThere have been quite a few recent trek reports of people attempting AC have got as far as, perhaps Manang and had to turn around as Thorung La had been closed – Sure, if you have the available time then this would normally open within a few days when the first large group blazed a trail – Similar can happen on EBC + There can be delays to Lukla flights, although with the new jeep road, as long as conditions aren’t too bad, then there is now a viable transport alternative only a day’s trekking away.My advice is also to go ahead and book your Nepal flight, but, if you are planning EBC, then make a cut off date when you would abandon this if you hadn’t been able to fly to Lukla within a given number of days.Also – It would be safer if you found a trek mate before setting off on your chosen trek - Personally I don’t think it is the greatest idea to trek alone, just from a safety point of view as if illness or accident happened then you have no back-up!!However, this doesn’t mean that you have to rush off and book onto an “Organised Trek” or even hire a guide, as, especially if you are traveling on a budget , then trying find a trek-mate before you set off is your first option – Then if you do decide to take along a Guide, Porter/Guide (This is one chap who will carry around 15Kg of your kit and speak enough English to give you basic info and guide you) or even just a porter (Porters pick up their load from you in the mornings and meet you at a pre-arranged destination later in the day – They do not normally walk with you) then you can share costs – And IF you aren’t successful in finding your trek-mate, then hiring at least a Porter/Guide would be the safest, and therefore the option that I would personally recommend.Good Luck and Happy Safe TrekkingRobTravel Pages including Nepal blog https:/…Edited: 1:53 pm, January 25, 2020 "
"I have just returned from an AC attempt and got stuck just before Chame with 4ft of snow. The trail will still be closed for several weeks at minimum so mid-February would be very risky. When I was there people north of Chame were being flown out by helicopter as they were stuck for several days to a week+ and were running out of time before their flights home.At the airport I met a girl who had just done the EBC, she said it was cold but did not have nearly as much snow that hit the Annapurna. IMO the EBC would be a safer option."
"okay - so rather EBC. Well I'll ask around once I arrive of course too. I think finding trek mates on the trail is also possible - it's for me usually easier because I like to hike fast - and very few people hike at that pace. Always easier to assess the skills of someone on the trail than in the city.I've booked my tickets yesterday. I could take snowshoes with me, watercooker and bivouac - but that does not help much if your the only one and then likely most teahouses also deserted. Yeah and different to usual scheduling - I'll plan my days at Kathmandu towards the end of the stay - not the beginning to keep some headroom. My bigger problem is now finding an insurance that pays for evacuation in case transport back home gets closed because 2019-NCOV - something not too unlikely (have a good friend who visited her parents for Chinese New Year - and now likely cannot return as scheduled/will have to cut short her stay all depending on government evacuation - and her insurance likely doesn't pay a thing because endemic events are excluded).I don't think Nepal will be isolated - but well possible flights out may be shut down or whatever - Nepal has not the same means to handle an outbreak like China."
"I would not be too worried for AC. I had snow more than 1 metre deep at Manang, in about 24 hours, in mid October 2005. We spent 5 nights at Manang, as it was impossible to walk up. We were then able to carry on - basically we walked through a groove in the snow, formed by others. In Jan 2016, the most recent time I have done AC, there had been some snow 2-3 weeks before our trek. This made the walk from Danaque slower (snow was about 6-8 inches deep), but it was not a major problem. It did stop all vehicle movements in that area, and so was a benefit to us, though the locals had to revert to walking. Many parts of AC, higher up, the snow had disappeared - Thorung La was fine. I think poster 4's trek was early January - if so, there is a good chance that that snow will have reduced by the time you get up to the higher parts. As for the risk of further snow, it is impossible to say - even though the winter is the dry season, that does not mean that there is no risk."

thanks - did not look into the overall Nepal forum. How good does information spread in Kathmandu? Can you trust what people tell you or not? I mean the reason we are discussing here such things without much knowledge already is caused by the fact that there is no official website announcing trail closures (at least not that I have found out about it).I'll definitely take enough gear to bivouac one night in a snow hole. And guess a small gas cooker to melt snow for water will also be part of my equipment. But not full out expedition gear - don't want to carry more than 10-11kg of gear PLUS water. A 20kg backpack vs 13-14kg is a huge difference for me.
Is the annapurna base camp route closed at the moment?
"Getting reliable up to date information on trail conditions in Kathmandu, or indeed anywhere is almost impossible.There used to be a great facility called The Everest Webcam which used to give you a hear and now picture of what conditions close to EBC were like evk2cnr.org/WebCams/…everest-webcam.html Alas, this has fallen into disrepair (It hasn’t worked since 2015) and locals are far more interested in extracting the maximum tax off you (Both through the Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality tax and the new Khumbu Hotel tax) rather than actually improving trekking safety.You can already see the vast differences in the advice that you are given – I tend to take a more cautious approach, but I have been trekking regularly in Nepal for more than 25 years and am, thankfully still alive :-)Good LuckRob"
"Forget snowshoes, I have never seen anybody carrying them or using/needing them. Lodges are open if the trails are passable.Carefull with fast hiking, that is the one big reason people get int trouble up there. Daily distances when going up are laughably short, but that is just the way it is, better live with it rather than die going faster.Trails are never officially closed (except maybe Annapurna Sanctuary trail), they just become impassable. Until some strong and desperate party pushes through, then it is easy for everybody else. Up there snow melts and sublimates fast."
"""it's for me usually easier because I like to hike fast - and very few people hike at that pace. ""They'll catch up with you you when you get AMS ;-)"
Go Superman!
"""I would hope Tilicho lake is reachable at least on AC if possible. Because going down from there to Jomson skipping Thorong La would be possible too. The avalanche danger should be a bit lower ""That route is WAY more difficult than the standard Thorong La route. And the avalanche danger before reaching Tilicho Lake can be very high.""but what the heck, stick to the rule of ~500m max more per day once above 3000). "" Re-read the rules...it's 1000m per 3 days.Edited: 1:54 pm, January 26, 2020 "
Another point on the Kang La if you are coming from Naar: the slope to the pass is entirely North facing and there could be loads of snow on it.
"""Without any snow I would have thought about going the very remote Koto Qupar, Meta, Naar, Kang La, Ngawal route - but according to my maps there are no tea houses at all, and with 36km, 4500m Ascent and 3500m descent that is simply not possible without sleeping at least one night one the way at such high altitudes""Koto to Ngawal via Kang La in 1 or 2 days... in February?!? Superman indeed.... (and FYI, you must take a guide for Nar-Phu restricted area)""20-30 minute break once per day... and I'll need to get 5500 calories at the tea houses as breakfast/dinner/packed lunch.""You'll not get that in 20-30 minutes... more like 2-3 hours. Not sure OP understands treks in Nepal.We may yet read about this."
"Mesokanto La to Jomsom direction is way worse than Thorung La in all respects. Even the Northern ""Tourist Pass"" is steeper on the west side than Thorong La. Besides, getting to either of those passes requires crossing another 5300m ridge line north of the lake before getting there, because it is not possible to follow the shoreline, many maps are faulty on that detail. Getting from Tilicho BC to Jomsom in 2 days is fast, getting across in one day (in deep snow???) is lunacy.Naar-Pho in two days/one night? Firstly you need to buy a restricted area permit for a week, and get a compulsory guide who is not going to make it at that speed. There are lodges in Meta and Naar, but both villages might be deserted in February.Short trip from Ngawal to Kang La and back? in distance maybe, but it is a 1700m climb and back (in deep snow again, at least near the top???).Interesting to read a report apres-trek..."

"Well I have hiked (or more expedition style) at similar altitudes in South America - on more difficult trails. So I know which distances I can still manage during a day. I've never been to Nepal - yes water is a bit of a concern for me - and using a gas cooker to heat up snow (with a couple of stones inside) would slow me down quite considerably if needed. But as I said - I'm used to long days (also in a row) mtbiking/trailrunning in the Alps. I usually do 3-4 hours outdoor sport per day - so I'm not the usual slow tourist. If there is deep snow - I know I can forget the timings - I have enough buffer. Oh and I didn't know about he special rules for Nar-Phu - so I will scrap that (and as I wrote - I expect this to be impossible due to snow anyhow as the exposition and narrow valley looks way to dangerous with lots of snow). As the trail up from Ngawal to Kang La is South facing I hope it's possible that's why I included it. And yes - Tilicho lake may maybe more problematic with snow too - but I think not for avalanches (at least you walk up the last steep part in the same exposition - makes it much easier to identify dangers than a south facing very high mountain field that warms up during the day and gets into danger of gliding avalanches). And yes - a webcam on Kang La would be super great to check every few days from now on to better understand the snowmasses or how fresh/old the snow is.I guess as soon as your high enough the water is kinda safe anyhow? My usual rule is - if there cannot be any animals above you, but big snowfields, drinking water from creeks is safe. So I would assume above 4500m you can safely drink the water also in Nepal (yes walk uphill 20-30m so to avoid that a trekker had polluted it - only streams coming from areas without trails. Am I wrong? And yes of course I know that you cannot drink too much snow water if you cook it - without adding some stones. But water coming down over stones - even if very close to snowfields is usually not too pure anymore - so safe. South America is also very unsafe regarding bacteria/viruses in water - but as soon as you are clearly above populated areas I never had problems (got food poisoning from being so stupid to eat a salad in a 5* hotel in Santiago - breaking my usual rule of only eating cooked/fried things or peel yourself. Must have been washed with contaminated tab water)."
"""Tilicho lake may maybe more problematic with snow too - but I think not for avalanches (at least you walk up the last steep part in the same exposition - makes it much easier to identify dangers than a south facing very high mountain field that warms up during the day and gets into danger of gliding avalanches). "" That is exactly the case on the middle route approach to Tillicho lake (coming from Khangsar). It's 10 years since I went there and crossed over to Jomsom so I am not sure if the middle route is still used (as opposed to the high route) but there is no way I would go that route with snow. The high route might be OK if it still exists.I am kind of surprised that you have experience of similar altitudes because you seem to be pretty casual about it."
"One of the big limitations of these forums is that responders almost never meet the person requesting advice/information. It is therefore very difficult to pitch replies in a way that is (hopefully) suitable for the original poster.You seem to have good experience, to be very confident (too confident?), but not to have read much (if anything) about high altitude trekking in Nepal. I would strongly advise you to get one of the standard books about trekking in Nepal. Some specific comments:Kang La: twice, with the younger of the guides I trek with, I have walked to the top of this pass from and back to Ngawal, as a day walk. This means going from 3,600m to 5,320m in about 4 hours. This is risky - I suspect that for many trekkers this rate of ascent could be dangerous, or very dangerous. We were quick enough to, in effect, stay ahead of AMS - the last part of the south side is steep, and so when descending, people lose about 500m of altitude quite quickly. However, some may get AMS - if they slipped or fell on the steep descent, problems would rapidly start to multiply. The views for the top of KL are excellent, some of the best I have seen in Nepal. The walk to KL, ie even if people do not go to the top, is very enjoyable. Be aware that very few trekkers, it seems, walk up this pass from Ngawal, and few locals do - we did not see anyone else at all, but our walks were in low season (Dec 2012 and Jan 2016). If you got into trouble, and were solo, it is very unlikely anyone will be around to help you. When we walked up KL in Jan 2016, there was snow on the ground from Danaque (as my post above), but as the Ngawal side of KL is south facing, and very exposed, the ground on that side was bone dry. The north side, which we did not descend, had quite a lot of snow - a huge contrast in a short distance. Most people will require 2/3 days to do Tilicho Lake. Say 1 day from Manang to Tilicho Base camp, 1 day to the lake from TBC, then to say Shree Kharka (which might well be closed in early Feb), then a day to Yak Kharka to re-join the main AC trail. I have been to Tilicho twice - last time in Jan 2016 the TBC lodges were closed - we managed to link up with 3 other independent trekkers, and after about 4 hours, my and another guide persuaded 2 locals to walk up with us to open a lodge for 2 nights at TBC. This worked really well, but a single person will not be attractive, unless you spend lots of money. The valley that leads to TBC is very prone to avalanches, if there is enough snow. People have been killed here, and there are rock falls - I saw a plate size stone in April 2008, here. It was very fast - if it had hit my head, I doubt I would be writing this. Get weather and trail information as you trek, especially from the older lodge owners - they have excellent local knowledge, contacts and good judgement of the conditions. Do not, at all, just rely on GPS or electronics. Weather can be very localised in the high Himalayas. Many of the younger guides have very little, if any, real experience of snow - most Nepalis live in villages/towns that never get snow, contrary to what most outsiders believe/assume. Treat info/advice from younger guides with some caution (though some younger guides are really good). Always keep an eye on cloud build up - no cloud, obviously, means no risk of snow (for at least a few hours) - heavy cloud means snow, possibly lots of it, is almost certain.Edited: 5:20 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"Long time back - actually in 2000 - I did quite a lot of trips in New Zealand with a retired high Profile Sherpa from Nepal (he had organised/summited/head guide quite a lot of Everest summit approaches) - and from what I still remember he told a lot about the little experience of most of the Sherpa that are porters at Everest or simply secure lower altitude trails above the Basecamp. And yes - keeping up with his normal speed required quite big efforts for me - but was possible. But based on salary alone it is quite clear that the profile of the guides here is much lower than on expeditions. And yes - I know that going up to Kang La - means going up high without being used to altitude - but I will be quick - so usually that is fine (and I can leave most of my stuff at the accomodation) and very helpful in adjusting to the altitude. Going down I'm sure to still manage 1000m/hour even at that altitude - so If I notice any symptoms I would directly turnaround - and maybe try next day again.I do have lot's of experience from freeriding snowboard semi professionally - but yes I won't have a shovel with me to do a snow profile, I am much slower on foot vs skis/snowboard, and I don't have access to a nice avalanche bulletin - so yes I do factor this in a lot. But I can assess the steepness very very well just be looking at a slope, I have a good feeling/knowledge to know when the sun has warmed up a slope enough so that wet snow avalanches get likely - and expect that at night it will still freeze well so that it may well be a timing issue. But if there are 1-2m of snow at 5000m on a EES slope - it will likely be too dangerous during the day to pass concerning Tilicho Lake ascent (so then maybe only an ascent with torch is possible - so you have enough time to come back if you want to enjoy some views at the top). But I'm pretty sure that Thorong La is then closed too (or only passable in the Morning before maybe 11:00 AM, which is easier of course due to the larger amount of huts, while Tilicho Base Camp is most likely closed)And yes - I can only assume based on maps - and it will depend a lot on the actual snow situation and snowline. I think the way up to Tilicho Base Camp is usually (no high danger days) pretty safe - the trail is definitely for a reason not down in the valley or on the other side. Then there is a short section that is pretty south facing - but most of the slope is facing East-East-South - and the ridgeline is around 5200-5300m - so I assume that not much snow is left - or only on the top 300-500m (if not - then I would assume that also Thorong La is not passable. I kinda guess if Thorong La does not have much snow - the hike up to Tilicho Lake is safe. As for continuing down to Jomson - it looks not too problematic from avalanche danger- ). Thorong La looks much worse on the map - At and after the pass you are in the runout zone of avalanches from a 6500m peak - so there is much more snow potential due to altitude."
"I can only add ""Best of luck"" to what I've said before."
"Armchair avalanche expert. Even thought I have walked the AC four times, also exited via Tilicho Tal to Thinigaon and done the Naar-Pho extension, I have never head about avalanches along these routes, except the freak incident last year near Bagarchap. If there is too much snow on the trails, nobody goes and lodges close. Simple as that. If OP is so confident and knowledgeable about snow conditions and moving fast at high altitude terrain in wintertime this forum is the wrong place to ask for advice. We, after all, are just trekkers trying to enjoy the hike, looking for easy and safe conditions, maybe even some cultural experiences also. If he can judge the conditions and the terrain with a map from the comfort of his home better than we do, so be it.Looking at the map can be misleading: usually Thorong La is passable (or ""open"") all winter, while Tilicho Tal route is not as there is too much snow there, while Thorong La might have none at the same time. It is not the altitude and contour lines only which matters, but terrain and micro climate conditions also.What comes to Kang La, getting up there from Ngawal as a day hike is a great achievement, but there is no altitude sickness danger in doing it. This has been discussed before. Daytrips to higher altitude with instant return carry no AMS risk and are recommended. Getting AMS takes about 12 hours, day hikes last less than 8 typically.Edited: 1:29 am, January 27, 2020 "
"In regards to asking around about conditions in KTM and or Pokhara. My wife and I tried to do this but most people did not know, and really only knew it would be cold but had no idea how much if any snow existed.On the trail, most people only knew the conditions of their local area. i.e. a day or two walk at most.I tired asking a few locals (and the ACAP office) how long it would take the snow to melt and the answers varied, from several weeks to a month plus. Most people said it is extremely variable or they had no idea.Some of the locals in the snow were closing up their lodges/houses and heading south for the remainder of the winter due to the heavy snow that fell when we were there. There is a strong likelihood that no lodges would be open in some of the smaller villages."
"Made it to Mungli from Chame via Upper Pisang, Ghyaru and Ngawal.

Now looks quite okay till mid Wednesday.The trail from Ngawal to Mungli really drenched me with my 18kg backpack. guess tomorrow I have some sore muscles. Decided to go down because I thought it's a bit too high - from 2670m directly to 3675. But now being really exhausted and just 200m lower is not really better.Met two people who"
Met two people in my tea house who tried to go to Ice lake today but turned around at 4300m because of too much snow. Guess it would be possible to continue on snowpack. Kang La according to tea house owners in Ngawal hasn't been done since the last snowfalls.Tilicho lake still very conflicting news.
"Last time, I had AMS symptoms in Ngawal, even after sleeping at Dharapani, Chame, Upper Pisang. You seem to be breezing through the circuit, reaching Ngawal that fast. I am just hoping that you know all the risks and dangers about AMS and how deadly it is, and that it has nothing to do with physical fitness etc. Best of luck.Edited: 9:15 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Today I had a leisurely day. Ice lake (didn't reach it but reached the viewpoint close by that is maybe 15-20m higher. Then down. (3:45 hiking time. 1 hour break at top for acclimatisation, because Kang la and tilicho not possible have to go slow anyhow). Then visited the monastery for an hour and continued to Manang (no one knew if in Between Manang and yak karrkha any tea house is open.. tomorrow to thorong pedi, then next day to kagbeni. Noticed today I can Keep my speed up to 4100m, then lose an.additional 10 Percent, yesterday this happened at 3600m. So I guess that is my critical altitude... Btw, read up a bit more on ams literature..for 4000m people need 3-6 days for acclimatisation. For 5000m it's 2-4 weeks. Clearly acclimatisation is not linear. At lower altitude it happens faster. Above 4000 is critical. So tomorrow sleeping at 4500m is not perfect, but no symptoms at all so far, hace/hape needs 24 hours to happen. So it should be safe for one night then again lower. It's like all people sleeping at high camp, it's too high for them but within the window if you had no symptoms before. And many treks follow even unsafer schedule because they do Manang - high camp.yes they sleep before Chame, Upper Pisang, Manang (2x), but they don't even reach 4000m before, and going up then sleeping lower is best practice. I will continue to  Actually if you are fit enough, and no snow it would be safe to do Chame - Manang - johmson. Yes Manang - jomson in one day is tough, but many locals do it. And if you have light baggage it's not a big deal if you are fit enough. That way for most people no need to acclimatisation at all."
"Good info on acclimatization details. As far as I learned while on the trek, there used to be no tea houses/villages between Manang and Muktinath in the early days. So, people had to walk in one day from at least Manang to Muktinath. You know about it and as long as you are watching (and most importantly listening to) your body signs, it's all good. However, for me, AC is beautiful because of the leisurely pace in a breathtaking geography. If it was structured like a 3-night trek between Chame-Manang-Jomsom, I probably would've never stepped on it. The teahouse/guesthouse stops, the 15-day timeframe of immersing in the culture and nature, and meeting tens of great people from all over the world are what make it one of the world's best (if not the best) treks. Acclimatization, even though not being fun on its own, has such a by-product that I love about AC.Edited: 3:54 am, February 16, 2020 "
Post 32: I agree - why rush. I hope to do AC for my 5th time this coming winter. By AC I mean walking from Besisahar to Nayapul or Dhampus/Phedi.
"Did a mistake by going straight from Manang to thorong Pedi. Got headache at night and had to turn around 1km before the pass. wasn't so bad but alone as everyone else had left by 4-5AM that day. Back down some fever in the afternoon. Found out I'm basically the only one not taking meds like diamox.Well after being given 2x250mg diamox back down today started again and went up real slow. Only last 200m altitude I knew I will be fine and paced up. 3:10 walking time from thorong pedi plus 20min break at high camp. Then 1 hour break at top walking around a bit, and doing 3 sets of 30 pushups with feet in the pass sign, to the delight of a big Thai group. (Well break between escht set like 2-3min. Really needs time to get heart rate down.No water at top so in suffered a bit on the way down until the small settlement. Gulped down 2 liter bottles of water and spoke with a porter who told me only 4 tourist ahead of me, all had left before 5 at high camp... Overtook like 30. One woman completely down just able to be dragged along by 2 group members (and poor porters having to carry the additional 3 daypacks). That way it's clear why groups are dangerous. I likely could have dragged myself along too yesterday, but being all alone and knowing no one behind me I had to keep it safe and back down even if only 1km away (120m altitude). Also wanted to see the pass and surrounding not feeling like dizzy like after a big joint.Arrived at Bob Marley hotel by 15:00So many people today because next days weather no good, new snow likely in 3-4 days. So I guess some groups cancelled their rest days. But of course they all did Manang + jak kahrka + thorong/high camp.Next time I know - if so fast then sleep at jak kahrka and go early from there. Or take diamox from the start.However in October I would have been fine air pressure in winter is like 300-40400m more altitude compared to October..And with diamox right from the start I would have been fine too. In thorong like 80percent of the people told me they take ity some up to 1000mg a day.I would next time sleeping over 4000m take 125mg before going to bed. Sleeping is so much better.."

Some people even shared a 1.5l bottle with 2. And diamox is so common here it's crazy. Also now air pressure is much lower than in autumn, 5000m now is same pressure as average 5350m in October. Plus the cold temperatures at night /evening are not helping your health either."
#37 Spot on!
"We've gone over Thorung La 4x... 1L each was always enough and never needed to purchase water on the way over.But perhaps it's because of all those push ups at the pass....Run, run, run!"
"I also have crossed Thorung La 4 times, 2 of those in the winter, and only every carry, or need, 1 litre of water. This is carrying my own full backpack all times. I have never carried, let alone used, Diamox (17 treks to date). It's impossible to verify the apparent advice from some of the guides - some are young and very inexperienced, others may have been joking (a wind up, as we say in the UK) - Nepali and Anglo humour is very similar."
"Well of course you can only drink so little, it's not good for performance or your body. I like 500ml each hour of exercise in cold temperatures, and 750-1l in the heat. When t got to the pass I had like 600ml left and knew I have to stretch it.The porter I met at the first settlement also drank 2l (and only had 22kg overall on his back, so not much more than my 18). If you need that much to refill your fluids it's not healthy. Of course doesn't kill you, but you may feel tired not because of.your. effort but running low on water"
"I find drinking when I'm thirsty sufficient (and a good indicator of need)... 1 litre has been sufficient for Thorung La.(Of course, trekking in 30°C at lower elevations I have indeed needed more water... and indeed drank lots: because I was THIRSTY.)Run run run!"
