"Hi. I was supposed to travel to the UK on 31st March this year but thanks to the coronavirus my flight has been cancelled. I had made four separate bookings with a hotel in Southend, Essex through Booking.Com as I needed an extended stay while I was arranging purchase of a house over there prior to moving permanently to the UK next year. The hotel gave me the option of cancelling the first booking (without a cancellation fee) that was two weeks in length. Through their help centre I’ve got Booking.Com to email the hotel about waiving the cancellation fees for the other bookings. This was 27th March. They emailed me and said the hotel would get back to me within 24 hours. Since then there has been no response from either the hotel or Booking.Com who I have sent three emails to over the last week. The next booking is supposed to start 15th April which is getting closer and I’m starting to wonder if both are trying to just ignore me. The booking is for a month and they may claim that when 15th April has passed that it is too late to do anything about it. Any suggestions?"
To start with an obvious question - is this a non-refundable booking?
Many hotels are shut - closed and it’s hard to get in touch as they have laid staff off And some may not be keen to answer calls.There is some debate on whether it’s appropriate to ask for a non refundable deposit to be refunded In normal circumstances I would say that if you book using the non refundable option then the customer is taking on the whole risk if they don’t turn up on the day for whatever reasonThere is an assumption that the hotel is not withdrawing from the agreement If say the hotel suffered flooding or a fire a few days before you were due and the hotel closed and you couldn’t stay there Then I think that there would be a case to expect even a non refundable booking to be reimbursed The hotel cannot provide what you paid for With COVID-19 some hotels have closed down and laid off staff so they cannot provide accommodation to any of their customers So who bears the risk and who should lose out ?I don’t think it’s as cut and dried as “ you booked “” non refundable “ you lose your money “.Some hotels are repaying all deposits regardless Some aren’t and won’tSome aren’t even answering the phoneThere are as many situations as there are organisationsSome reputable and doing the “ right thing”Others clinging on for dear life and customers deposits
We have had to cancel our holiday with Sykes cottages due to the virus. They will NOT refund any monies but will give an alternative date. That doesn't read.ly help in these uncertain times. If we agree to another date we will be expected to pay the full amount for the cottage and could possibly loose even more money that we may never be able to get back.Sykes cottages are stealing from their customers and I will never use them again.
Connector have you read the terms and conditions that you signed up to?I think you will find that their offer is as stated there.
You will probably find that this is a non refundable booking but your paperwork or screen confirmation should say somewhere.There are extensive posts about Booking.com on Bargain travel forum which will put many people off booking through them or similar for the future.Wherever possible book direct with the hotel in future
"#3, please don't hijack other people's threads. Your holiday cottage booking has nothing to do with the OP's issue.OP - these are not normal times, and things have become a lot less normal since you cancelled your first booking. I think it's one of those cases where you just have to be patient - 15 April is still ten days away.Have you tried phoning the hotel?"
"""There are extensive posts about Booking.com on Bargain travel forum which will put many people off booking through them or similar for the future.Wherever possible book direct with the hotel in future""I always use booking.com and always use the ""free cancellation"" option, even if it does cost a few quid more than not using ""free cancellation"" or even booking direct with the hotel. So in future I would actually advise people to use booking.com and make sure you use ""free cancellation"".I've told friends and family to do the above, but they ignore me and still go ahead and boko direct. My brother and his wife booked direct with Travelodge for a trip next month that now won't take place, and the are in limbo because they don't know when or if they wil get their money back!Edited: 9:41 am, April 04, 2020 "
"I’ve had to cancel 3 booking.com reservations for next week - all went exactly as per the terms: one I lost 50% deposit (which is now with travel insurance), one I had prepaid but could cancel up to 7 days prior and have got it all back and one was pay on arrival and was simply cancelled at no charge. No queries, no issues. Got what I signed up to."
If a hotel cannot provide the contracted for accommodation due to Coronavirus the contract is a frustrated contract within the meaning of the frustrated contracts act snd is null and void. All monies paid must be returned
"Frustrated contracts only applies in England and Wales not Ireland or Scotland sadly for me, I was looking into it as am struggling to get hotels to refund our “non refundable deposits” despite them being closed during our travel dates"
Have you thought of referring them to the CMA who clearly have views on the subjecthttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…
