Alright.. i just got off the center for disease controls website and there is alot of warnings about the norovirus and precautions about maleria.. im thinking of cancelling my trip for march to the iberostar bavaro.. i am planning on taking anti-malerial drugs but has anyone recently been to the punta cana resort area.. where u sick?.. or did u hear of anyone sick??? anyone thinking of cancelling there up coming trip??? thanks alot!! www.cdc.gov
"We are going in a few weeks too and are also taking the malaria drugs, but we are still going. I'd say go. Bring along bug spray with deet and if you go on the jungle safari cover your arms and legs. Chances are you'll be fine."
"We just got back from Iberostar Bavaro. Didnt see either a bug or anyone sick the whole week. Its a great spot. Beautiful grounds, good food, bottled water everywhere, beach to die for. GO and ENJOY. Common sense goes a long way!"
going in april! what are the chances this malariar scare will be over with?
"I wouldn't worry so much about the sickness. Use your common sense and remember...if you're drinking alcohol and sitting in the sun all day and not drinking your required 2 litres of water per day...you WILL be dehydrated! Dehydration can sometimes look like the flu, what with the diarrhea and all. Relax and take care of yourself while you're away and you should be fine. Oh, and wash your hands a lot."
"we just got back yesterday! Had a wonderful time!!! Go!!!!just use common sence. we took anti malria meds, we did see a few mosq. our daughter had about 5 bites I had one. Are resort, bahia principe was vey full, no one was sick, all seemed to be enjoying them selves. it was wonderful, you can get the flu enywhere. Just relax and enjoy yourself!!!! i considered cancelling for a minute Thank goodness I did not!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"You should not go, unless you want to and well then you should."
"If you stay home an douch a doorknob at the mall that someone sneezed at, you will get sick if you put your hand in your mouth. Moral of the story: dont put your hand in your mouth.Or, in this case, dont dip your finger into the sugarbowl.Whatever the case, if you dont go around licking tiolet seats and eating mosquitos, i think youll be fine.The reply before mine says it best."
"I am freaking out as well. Yeah everyone says you can get it anywhere but gosh, I am still a little freaked. I leave April 20th and its horrible to be so worried about a VACATION! I wouldn't even know HOW to get my $$$ back, any thoughts? "
"as for money back, check your insurance policy. if you booked with a credit card, they may offer you some type of travel protection just for booking with their card. Some policies will allow cancellation due to illness, however, you may have to wait until last minute to make that claim, im not sure. Check your cancellation waiver...you still have plenty of time that maybe you can back out.As a failsafe, you could try to stop payment.Dont commit any fraud, just check out your options. It really depends on how you paid and who you booked through.My opinion: i really dont consider the ""sickness"" a risk. Any sickness could break out anywhere, at anytime. Enjoy your vacation. Life is too short to worry about not living."
"Hi, trixie,We were in Punta Cana 18-25th of december. We took chloroquine as advised with no problems. I would not cancel. We did get sick, but not from something at the resort we had a good week. We figured we picked it up on the plane on the way down. So my advise to you is be more concerned on the plane. Take lysol wipes and wipe down your area.We have been following this site, figuring someone would come up with what we had. And I guess we had the early norovirus. We are back to normal and if we could go tomorrow would.Have a nice holiday. "
There was a story about this on our newcast yesterday and that many people are canceling. I'm trying not to worry myself. My biggest concern is my children getting sick but we plan to bring along some water free soap to wash with frequently and I'll encourage my children to wash their hands continuously and use bug spray. We will also drink bottle water and stay away from certain foods - bascially be aware and careful. I'm still unsure about the malaria drugs - waiting for our appt at the WRHA for updated info to decide. We went to Mexico and a couple years ago and everyone was ill at one point or another except for me. The alcohol didn't help either. I think some people can handle things better than others. I'm not one to get sick much as it is and my kids have a pretty good immune system too. 
"I am going April 1st and i am not concerned about it-norovirus is everywhere-in fact they just had a outbreak of it here in nova scotia .I am going to take hand sanitizer,in fact i bought some already and i am encouraging the family to use it continuously now-lysol wipes aand we are going to be healthy when we go.I think the whole thing is being blown out of proportion-a lot of people overeat aand overdrink and the body can only handle so much.So anyone that is going take your proper meds and go and have a great time.sheila in nova scotia"
"We just got back two weeks ago. Saw noboby who was sick and saw no mosquotes. Did not get sick ourselves, had a wonderful time. I really believe that some of the folks on this board are going to worry themselves sick.Just a little anology, in two weeks it will be Mardi Gras in New Orleans and average of 3-4 peolpe die (that is die, dead, finito, gone to the here after) per year at Mardi Gras activities. Does that stop 2 million people from going? Hell no.Everything is a risk, I'd bet the odds are better of your dying on the way to the airport than from getting any sort of serious desease in DR.If I can help anyone out by taking there vacation for them please let me know.For God's sake go, have a good time, and tell us all about it when you get back"
"I have followed CDC site Candadian sites and Europe.As for Malaria, you have more chances of getting it in Florida. We are taking two children and after talking to people returning and our doctor we have decided NOT to give the drugs. Most dont have problems but why if no big risk. The Hotels spray their area's every day to prevent them. This is their main busines and they must protect it.Hep A shot we did get. You can get that here in the states so to be on the safe side we got the shot. Fast easy and now we are protected.Taking lots of Clorex wips. Wipe down plane seat and clean your room when you first arrive. AFter that use common sense. Wash hands a lot and dont drink water. We have a school system closed today because of virus so it can happen anywhere.Last DRINKING, I can hold my own and do, hahah, but some people cant and then blame the food. You can drink all you want eat all you want hang in VERY hot sun and expect to not feel it. HA I think some people are just hung over.Take care have fun and take it from a mom you can get sick anywhere anytime. And if while in the sun instead of 10 degrees I will take it."
"The other thing that folks forget is that all of those tropical drinks are made with a lot of sugar, sweetners and fruit juice. When you are not used to that amount of sugar or typically don't drink fruit juice it will give you a stomach ache and diareah. Has nothing to do with the food.Just as an aside: If you are ever in an area where you do question the food supply, sweets are the best thing to eat. Sugar is a natural anti bacterial agent."
"Like you , I was a little concerned about all the rumours. I have a pre-exisiting intestinal illness. I saw my specialist yesterday and he said that you can get sick anywhere just be carefull... I also called my cancellation insurance and since there are no travel advisories, even with a doctors note - I can not cancel!!If you can cancel and it would make you feel more at ease than do so, if not go and enjoy yourself!! Try not to worry or it will ruin the trip for you!"
"A man asked the monk...""how do I obtain enlightenment?"" He replied...""go ask that tree."" -Zen ProverbNo offense but I don't know why I keep reading this stuff...listen...there is no maleria in Punta Cana...you dont need meds you dont need shots...I know people that live there all this stuff about CDC alerts etc. show me where it says anyone has contracted maleria in Punta Cana in the last few months...go on vacation already, stop being scared of life...if you want to go to a hotel where people speak English go to Tampa...your going to another country, are there risks...sure...but the chance of you getting maleria on your trip is so small it is not worth worrying about...just bring bug spray...and as for viruses...you get that all over the caribbean...especially in resorts, cruise ships , etc...you got alot of people in one space...also I always get sick when temps change drastically like going fro 10 degrees F to 80 then back to 10...your sinuses expand and contract and it gives me a sinus infection or a flu...please people lets try to relax...if your that worried about yourself or your family well then in my opinion you should just stay home...I'm not trying to be combative I am trying to get a point across so that people relax and enjoy themselves. Safe Travels."
"Marat now you tell me its not good to lick doorknobs...I would have liked to have known that a little earlier...dam...I kney something was wrong , just didn't feel right... "
"As of Jan. 11, 2005, CDC recommends that all travelers to La Altagracia Province and Duarte Province, including travelers to the PUNTA CANA resort area, should take an antimalarial drug. "
BMS.. How about u do ur research and go to www.cdc.gov before u give me advice on how to become enlightened.. the cdc is the center for disease control just incase u didnt know.. how about im sick of people like u who dont do there research
"No need for hostility ""trixie""...I've done plenty of research on my trip...some of it included TALKING to PEOPLE, friends who actually live there and travel to and from constantly...but you never answered my question...where on the CDC site does it list anyone who has contracted maleria in Punta Cana in the last year...I've been on the site...try to think and put things into perspective...youre travelling to a third worls country...people get sick...the odds of you contracting Maleria are infantesimal, however if you are so ""freaked out"" there is an easy solution don't go. I suggest you revist the site and read everything and pay less attention to off-base posts by people who are hysterical and deal in rumors and supposstion."
Or to be ultra safe take whatever anti-malerial drug you want and use bug spray...simple. BUT THERE IS NO MALERIA EPIDEMIC IN PUNTA CANA...that is just plain false...
"Well yea if u look under travelers health on the CDC site there is an outbreak warning.. saying and i quote "" As of January 11, 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received reports of 17 cases of malaria in travelers to resort areas of the Dominican Republic"" i dont think it gets any clearer then that.. i am not hostile.. just concerned about my trip.. and i wont be staying home i was simply asking other members on this site if they were concerned.. and since u arent, then this post doenst apply to u.. happy traveling www.cdc.gov/travel/other/malaria_dr_2004.htm"
"As of January 11, 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received reports of 17 cases of malaria in travelers to resort areas of the Dominican Republic. Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been confirmed in 3 patients from the United States, 6 from Canada, and 8 from European countries, all of whom had recently traveled to areas of the Dominican Republic where malaria had not previously been reported. Sixteen of the patients had traveled to Punta Cana resorts in La Altagracia Province and one to San Francisco de Macor��s in Duarte Province in November 2004. Sixteen returned home during November 3-16, and one returned December 20, 2004. Although all the patients were hospitalized initially and six were critically ill, no deaths have been reported. For more information about these cases, see cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5351a1.htm. IF that kind of things scares you stay home...17 out of hundreds of thousands...CDC recommends that all travelers to La Altagracia Province and Duarte Province, including travelers to the Punta Cana resort area, should take an antimalarial drug. In addition, an antimalarial drug is recommended for travelers to rural areas throughout the country. Chloroquine is the recommended drug for the Dominican Republic. Antimalarial drugs taken correctly and consistently, along with other measures to prevent mosquito bites, have been shown to be effective in preventing malaria. Therefore, CDC does not discourage travel to malaria-endemic countries. 14 cases in the Eastern part of DR...14 out of hundreds of thousands of tourist in 2004 but none since December...approximately 1,500--2,500 malaria cases are reported annually in the Dominican Republic; in 2004, a total of 2,012 cases had been reported through November-that's low DR is huge with millions of people...I'll take my chances , the CDC recommends anti-malerial drugs...I will not take them and have no worries. "
Thats great.. u asked for proof and i gave it to u.. now u do whats right for u and i will do whats right for me.. have a fun trip.. watch out for those mosquitos.. lol
"Hello Trixie. Just to let you know you are freaking out for nothing. I am not a doctor, I lived in the DR for the past 2 years and have been back in Canada since May. First of all, the norovirus is a flu, the same you have in the US, and we have in Canada. It happens during the winter. As for the malaria, there was an acute reason for the ""outbreak"" that happened. First there was a hurricane that left stagnant water around increasing the amount of mosquitoes. Then they brought in Haitian labour to fix hotel damage caused by the storm. Haiti is always at risk from Malaria, as they are the poorest country in the western hemisphere. One of these malaria infected Haitian workers were bit by one or a few of the mosquitoes, and in turn those mosquitoes passed it on to less than 10 people. There are an average of about 30 flights a day into the south east of the Dominican Republic. Lets say an average flight has 200 people on it. That is 6000 people per day that arrive in Punta Cana. This means that in one month over 180,000 people go to Punta Cana. There was what 6 people who got sick over a one week time frame. If those odds scare you I reccomend you never leave your house because you have almost the same odds of dying walking down the street.The Iberostar is an excellent hotel and you have nothing to worry about."
word.
Im am not the squimish type nor am i the type of person that is scared of walking down the street.. i dint think i was gonna get such attitude from people.. sorry for expressing my concerns..
Hey I'm sorry trixi...I am just frustrated with people who I think are over -reacting...your health is yours to manage as you wish...I didn't mean to preach...I hope you choose whats right for you and have an awsome time...good luck
"Thank you, have a nice trip as well.. when are u going? when are u staying?"
I'm staying at LTI feb 16-21st going with 2 friends all guys 28-31...I can't wait to go...it's so freaking cold...
trixie - don't apologize - you are ok to inquire - have a great time!
Awe thanks eager.. Just getting ansy.. i dont leave till march 12th..!!!!
we stayed at the palladium and Killed 11 mosqitoes in our room. we came home with bites and are glad we took the meds. Better to be safe than sorry. We had to spray ourselves to sleep one night. King of grouse.
Murderer!!!
"Trixie22ny we were to go to Punta Cana March 26-April 2. Granted my husband has a heart condition and his cardiologist advised against it. Chances of getting it?? But if you do, you become very ill. Also, anti-malaria meds can cause serious liver damage, so definitely talk to your doctor. We had trip insurance and canceled and change our destination with no problems. Just leaving a few days later and coming home April 4. We were also informed that the mosquitos could get worse as it gets hotter and they are looking for water sources.Hope this helps!"
"Hi trixie,,This is in reply to BMS1974.....After looking at a few of your posts and replys you are going to hate LTI. We were there over christmas and had a good time at the resort but there is no night life, and it it quite quiet. My suggestion to you is take a quick course in German,so you can converse with folks in the day, but I probably think you all ready are fluent , as you seem quite ill advised in what is happenning in Punta Cana at the moment. So happy trails, and honestly looking at your replys on some posts you will have some problems."
"my family and i returned home on the 24th of jan. most beautiful place. one by one we fell ill like dominos. we didnt touch the water,nor brush our teeth with it.my husband had to get shots by hotel doc he was soooo bad. i had my 15 month old with me. he was very ill. all americans we ran into(the 2 days we were able to leave our room comlained of same issues.(violently ill from both ends) gross i know but true. no one ever told us about the malaria.? i know we most likely dont have it, but i would have NEVER taken the chance. i composed a 15 page letter to apple vacations and iberostar. shouldnt they have told us before we left? also if ur getting a crib for a child it was the biggest,rickety disgrace i've ever seen...be ware. paradise can be deceiving....anyone else at iberostar bavaro suites 1/17/05-1/24 and experience same????"
also book with my credit card.Also have canceletion insurance call the credit card company yesterday. He told me the only way I can get my money back is if The Department of Foreing affaire decide to cancel all flight out cause of the virus. an so far they havent.
great.. i leave for the bavaro on march 12th
"near north...with all due respect, please don't tell me if I will enjoy my trip or not...because you have no idea who I am or what you are talking about...I have heard the exact opposite of everything you are saying and I know people who live there...I know where I am going, what to expect and how to have a good time...if you want to make posts fine tell people what you think, you can even ramble on about how sick everyone was and all that nonsense but please don't tell me that I am not going to have fun...I'll be sure to give a review when I get back..."
Seriously ...don't even respond again to my post...
WOW! Everyones a little testy and could use a vacation! I am going to the Dr on March 25th to the Viva Dominicus Beach in La Romna... Anyone been there? I went to Puerta Plata last year and I hear La Romana has nicer beaches (and mosquitos)
I love it. BMS...you go and have a great time with your friends. Remember that your vacation is what you make of it and nothing more. Stay safe and have an awesome time!
"Quite worrying, we are a group of 13 at the bavaro princess, we leave to go back home tomorrow, and none of us have been sick. We have eaten the salads, fish, etc. I would advise to take the malaria pills though because I have been bitten 3 times by mosquitos. No one else in my group has; however, I guess they like me. The weather is beautiful, enjoy your trip"
We just returned from DR on Monday and had a great time. No one that we know of was sick.. have a great time!!
"Just came back Jan 18th, 2004- Punta Cana area.No one sick at Grand Paradise Bavara. Took malaria pills and didn't see any mosquitos at all while there.Eat and drink moderately. Drinks lots of fluids while under the sun.Unless the resort you go to has had reports of sickness, don't cancel your trip.Go and enjoy!"
