"As of now I am still planning to come to Cabo with my 2 teenagers for our 5 day vacation. I suppose by tomorrow morning things could change as far as a travel ban. From what I've read things sound pretty mellow there. We have a direct flight, are all young and healthy, just plan to literally lay by the pool all weekend. Is there any threat to our safety I haven't thought of, aside from maybe having to self-quarantine? Any rumors of the Mexican government restricting travel, imposing quarantines on travelers?"

"I posted this on another thread, but I think it is relevant here as well.One of the best things I've heard lately is from Dr. Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. When speaking about responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Medley said “Don’t think about changing your behaviour so that you won’t get it. Think about changing your behaviour so you don’t give it to somebody else.” So Instead of thinking about protecting ourselves, we should pretend we are already infected and are trying to protect others."
Sorry you are being subjected to such blatant judgement here. We all have to do what we deem best. I plan to travel to Cabo in a little over a week if we are still able to.
"Exactly! Just talked to my 80 year old dad (retired police chief of serving 40 plus years) he said ""if you can get down there, stay down there""! He's not worried, just living out his life after bigger hurdles than this! I have to agree!"
"Here is the message thats worth telling others:“Don’t think about changing your behaviour so that you won’t get it. Think about changing your behaviour so you don’t give it to somebody else.”Edited: 11:30 pm, March 15, 2020 "
How can you argue with that !
"Trip is still on will stay on as usual to Cabo. Not going to live my life in fear!Edited: 11:33 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"It's not lliving your life in fear, it's trying to protect yourself and others.Can you afford to stay down there if you can't get home? Can you afford to be quarrantined when you get home? Can you live with yourself if you bring it down and infect others?Come on people, stop being so selfish!"
"Today governors in Ohio and Illinois have shut down bars and restaurants to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Today the governor of California called for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Tomorrow the governor of Washington state will sign a statewide emergency proclamation to temporarily shut down restaurants, bars and entertainment and recreational facilities. In WA all gatherings of 50 people or more will be prohibited and smaller gathering will be subject to more public health criteria (of which I am not currently informed). NYC will limit all restaurants to carry out only or delivery only and nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses and concert venues must all close. Additionally today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that people throughout the U.S. should avoid events of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.All of these actions are being ordered or recommended to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US. I am having a hard time understanding how then it makes sense for people from those states or cities (or now any state in the US) to simply pack up whatever risk they are carrying and take it to another country. The bars, restaurants and clubs in Cabo San Lucas will be filled with the same people that are being restricted from gathering at home to prevent the virus from spreading. Because these people are going to gather in another place, is the risk of spreading the virus somehow different?"
"I understand where you are coming from and you are right to say so. However, we do not live anywhere with any cases, none of us have had even the slightest symptoms of being ill in months, and we don’t plan to go running around, just parking at the resort. But still, I get it......"
"Have a contingency plan if you end up staying longer than planned. Bring extra prescription medications & take a credit card with a high limit. Many airlines are cancelling flights (American is eliminating 75% of its international flights) so you may have to be financially prepared to extend your stay, purchase air tickets, etc. I have a friend whose flight from Europe was cancelled, she had to book her family on a different airline (her airline was completely booked for a week) and it was very pricey. Also, be prepared for the possibility of self-quarantine when you get home. Safe travels!"
"I’m planning on coming in a few days. I’m healthy and doing precautions and I don’t have high risk people near me. I’m looking forward to getting the hell out of this craziness. I have read, and read, and read. I don’t see any restrictions coming. But we are prepared just in case"
"Heather ~ did you hear about this?""An emergency room doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland is in critical condition with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus."" https:/…"
"Heather - Same for us. Lot of fear mongering going around, no one on this board can tell any one what to do."
"It’s fine, people are entitled to say what they and did come here asking for opinions! And honestly, there are valid points here."
People need to decide for themselves and to be prepared with contingency plans in the event of imposed quarantines or border closures. Have lots of cash or credit cards on handThere's no point in arguing about this on this site. People will do what they're going to do
"Journey380805, just a comment from an opinion piece that I saw today (any parenthetical statements are mine):""COVID-19 is spreading, and you won’t know you’re infected until you’ve already infected others. Right now, you have no immunity to prevent you from getting the disease (and neither does anyone else you come in contact with). It’s especially lethal for older people or those with underlying conditions (that you may come in contact with if you don't stay home).BTW, the title of the article is ""The best thing everyday Americans can do to fight coronavirus? #StayHome, save lives."" The authors of the article, which contains a lot of other advice are not people that post opinions on TripAdvisor like me, but experts in the field.

Yes it is your choice.. I'm not going to tell you. You should or should not.. But my concern is they might shut the border down. No way in and no way out. It's just not the us thinking about it.. It's mexico too.. That would be my concerns and if you enough to stay awile.. I think if you go on vacation you should have money to live on for a month at least.
But I'm sure if they block the border they will have time to let you back in. They probably will give advance notice.
So in a ideal world everyone stayed home wouldn’t we all have to stay home for months ?? I get staying home will help to stop the spread of the virus but how will this cure it ?? Do we all need to stay home until a cure is found and then does everyone in the world need to have a to book appointments for the vaccine??
"It's not COVID-19 you need to worry about, it's all the nuts going crazy. Time will tell but my money is on this getting real ugly fighting over the last scraps or at least what the nuts believe are the last scraps. No way are the wife and I traveling and leaving our 20 year old son to deal with all the nuts. Once it starts, the media will hype it up and it will spread. The Watts Riots will be child's play by the time this is over."
"Panic buying in the UK has been beyond ridiculous and the media hype I believe has caused this, there has even been reports of putting the army on the streets causing more panic !!"
"I'm cancelling my trip .....suppose to fly there this Saturday . I've gone back and forth the last week....changing my mind every 1/2 hour . its just not worth it to me. I don't want to get sick in Mexico, I don't want to pass it to someone there and I don't want to pass it to anyone when I return. chances are slim....but not worth the chance. good luck to you......."
"I can understand cancelling if you are about to visit as the virus seems to be on the rise but surely we cant hide from it forever, this virus will have to run its cause ?Lots of small business that rely heavily on tourists are going to be the most affected as well as the smaller airline and travel companies. :-("
durie-our 1st visit to Cabo next week from LGW.At present still going as flights still available to book.Awaiting/expecting a call saying holiday cancelled so we will get a refund & rebook in time.If flight/ holiday goes ahead-we will be on board as not cancelling.
We are in the same boat as you. I've been checking advice daily and changing my mind hourly.But if we are well and the flights are going I expect we will travel. No word from our travel agent as yet.
"A waiting game. Hols are still available to book with Tui/First Choice to Mexico. As said,expecting the hols to be cancelled but if not-we go."
Relatives living in MX (Medical Professionals) are telling family to stay away from resorts like Cancun because the MX Gov has not stopped incoming flights from Europe and Asia. I have no idea how popular Cabo is as a destination for the Asians or Europeans. Also I'm told the MX Socialized Health Care system used by the poor and lower middle class is NOT TESTING for CV. Only in the Private Health Care system is testing being done. SO ... how can you trust the number of reported cases in MX to be true.
"#28 More importantly, how can you trust the US health care system that has been woefully inadequate to test? For example and by comparison, two weeks ago when the US had still conducted under 10,000 test nationwide, my province of Alberta, a province of about 3 million people, tested 1000 people over 1 weekend. We now are testing about 1000 per day. Evidence is increasingly pointing to widespread community transmission in the US..."
I'm curious about all the questions about travelling to Mexico from folks in the UK. I was under the impression that your governments have said that you should stop all unnecessary travel.
The non essential global travel advisory notice was only recently given by the UK Govt-less than 4 hrs ago.
"Thanks. That is exactly what I was wondering. That should answer the questions now though, right?"
True-just awaiting direct contact to cancel & refund.We will rebook when we can-probably from may earliest to the Caribbean/Mexico area. One day we will get to Cabo. Adios!
Good luck with your cancellations. I'm trying to do that for a trip I had planned for somewhere else. Stay healthy!
"Scarletrugby, Los Cabos is a fun place to visit. I'm sure you will enjoy it."
TUI (UK travel agent ) are still offering holidays but not up to the 16th April. We booked ours only last night to travel on the 30th April so let’s see what happens in a few weeks !
"#29 ... US developed a better test. It took time. Produces way fewer false pos & neg than those tests used abroad. We will get more accurate results. Trump closed travel to high infected countries early on. Bought the US time to study virus, foreign testing ... Trump has put together gov & business partnership to take on virus and care for our citizens. Mexico on the other hand has donenothing."
"Journey - I don't understand why you say there are no cases where you live. I live in the same county as you and there are cases. I'll also assume you are flying out of SJC where at least 4 TSA agents tested positive. We are also next to Santa Clara county which has a large number of cases, including deaths."
"Here is the latest correspondence from family in Mexico.Hello D***, here in the state, almost everything is closed except restaurants. Schools closed Cinemas bars party halls. There is a lot of talk that nothing is being done in airports or in tourist places, there are many people who are not paying attention to the recommendations and the cases of covid 19 continue to increase every day. I think it is (NOT) advisable to travel to Mexico because the airports are unsafe as many flights coming from Europe continue to arrive without security filters"
They just posted an international travel ban for all Americans.
"Plan on being stuck for weeks amidst chaos, higher crime, and desperation."
Coming in May! Trip is on and will stay on!

"Hi CrystalRogersThis is a two month old thread. Lots has happened since then. Or maybe it's more accurate to say, absolutely nothing is happening now. Read some of the recent threads. One thread has a video taken today of downtown Cabo."
