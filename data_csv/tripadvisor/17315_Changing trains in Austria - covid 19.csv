A long shot but just in case anyone can help! We are travelling to Croatia next week by train. Our Munich-Zagreb ticket involves changing trains at Villach. As we are from the UK we are not currently allowed into Austria. According to the official guidance we are allowed to pass through Austria in transit but I can’t work out whether we are allowed to change trains or whether it has to be non stop. Our tickets will show that we are moving straight on to Zagreb so I’m hoping it won’t be a problem but I’m worrying about being turned away at the border! I’ve tried contacting the train company and the Austrian embassy but haven’t managed to get through to anyone.Anyone have any definite knowledge of this?Thanks!
"https:/…entry-requirements states that If you’re transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate if you can prove you are transiting.To me, a stopover implies something rather more substantial than a swift change of trains.I believe that wearing masks is compulsory on public transport in Austria.Edited: 7:48 pm, July 08, 2020 "
"There is no such thing as ""transit"" when crossing a country by train. Not in the way this is generally understood as when travelling by plane. Trains stop multiple times, people get on and off, you may have several different people sharing your compartment with you during the trip. Having a ticket is not an assurance that you will stay on the train. You will need a medical certificate not older than 4 days that you are Covid-19 free, and hopefully you can convince any officials you encounter at the border that you are indeed just passing through."
"I think it's the officials that you might meet who will have the final say, and their definition of what a stopover is when travelling by train will apply. But having read the Entry - Transit declaration form, I think you should be OK as long as you have that recent negative test and face coverings."
"#2 - I don't think that's correct. For example, throughout the crisis, Austria allowed people transit to Slovakia using Vienna airport (without a test). This involved getting off a plane in VIE and taking a train or taxi to the border. This was perfectly acceptable, border guards always allowed it and at some point even the embassy website stated it is allowed. The same applied in the opposite direction.So yes, transiting using a train should be possible. There must not be any undue delays in Austria (e.g. spending a day in Villach) but taking the fastest route is considered a transit.In any case, I highly recommend that OP contacts their local Austrian embassy for clarification.Edited: 2:48 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"Are there any border controls between Germany and Austria now? I thought the border was open again, but could of course be wrong."
"There are no routine checks, but that doesn't void the law."
just to add to the hassle UK is also in Slovenia's red zone list https://www.policija.si/eng/newsroom/news-ar…
