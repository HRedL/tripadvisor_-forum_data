Coming to Richmond to watch a basketball game at VCU. Are there any hotels within walking distance of the stadium?
I suggest you check to make sure the event is still being held.
"You could walk to the Siegal Center from the Marriott or Hilton downtown, or the Graduate. It's probably about 3/4 mile away.I do agree that you should check every day, not only to see whether the event will be held, but whether an audience will be allowed in."
"Since VCU academics are going online and the school's own blog says that VCU Athletics' discussions on spectator restrictions are ongoing, respondents seem duty bound to advise checking ahead."
"There is one confirmed case in Richmond, please see link below.https:/…Virginia currently has 15 presumptive cases, please see link below.…virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation…"
This is why kesh_grammy's initial advice to check ahead was solid:https://blogs.vcu.edu/covid-19-coronavirus/
"Indeed, Explore.Kesh_Grammy is nothing but polite and informative. Yes, the event IS being held, but the fans and family members are not permitted to attend. Thanks to the Kesh_Grammy, you now have to choice to go and not attend, or stay home and not attend.Either way, it's better than finding out last minute at the arena.According to the VCE website:""VCU Athletics: VCU Athletics will play its spring sports events WITHOUT fans or family until further notice in response to the Coronavirus outbreak, VCU Vice President and Director of Athletics Ed McLaughlin announced Thursday. At this time, games will continue to be played as scheduled with only essential personnel permitted to attend."""
"Just reported: the VHSL tournament being played this weekend at the VCU Siegel Center has now been canceled. Earlier today, they said it would continue, but with immediate family members only allowed in.VCU sports will continue to be played, but no spectators will be allowed until further notice."
