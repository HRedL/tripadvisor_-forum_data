I am on day 4 0f not smoking. Been a smoker for some 50years. Going cold turkey. Ay advice Please. ?
When I stopped (12 years ago) after 40 years smoking I used nicoette inhalators gradually reducing use and I haven't touched a cigarette since. I got them on prescription just by going to a pharmacy and telling them I wanted to stop but under the present restrictions you will not be able to do that.
"I don't know what brands of throat lozenges you have for coughs and colds but I bought the strongest ones here in Canada and I found they helped a lot with the physical aspect.The psychological part is harder, and making sure you know your triggers and habits and counteracting them is good. I drank tea instead of coffee in the morning, after a meal I had a lollipop. Sounds crazy but it helped.Good luck, keep going. It is hard to kick and you will crave it for a long time but it does make life easier not needing a ciggie."
"Further to the above Mrs C went the vaping route again gradual reduction (in nicotine strength and usage) until she is now down to a few puffs a day, I think she will have stopped completely in a couple of weeks."
"My dad was a 40 a day smoker for 50 years and even smoked Capstan He was in hospital for just over a week having a hip operation and no one told him the nurses would push your bed in to the day room to have a smoke.So, by the time he got out of hospital he had gone about 10 days with no cigarette and he never smoked again.Stick with it, if he could do it anyone can"
"I quit cold turkey 12 years ago. Did not use anything. What worked for me is that I kept a pack around and instead of saying I'm never smoking again, I just kept postponing lighting up by saying ""I'll have one later."""
"I quit 26 years ago, and I still miss it sometimes. So be kind to yourself."
What is capstan
Research in China and France tends to show that smokers are somewhat protected from the coronavirus.https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/…France will use nicotine in clinical trials.
"I wonder if that is because more of the smokers are men and they get better treatment. It is possible, because it takes longer before a woman will get to a hospital."
travlmneCapstan full strength in 1973 was deemed to have the highest nicotine content for a cigarette in the UK.Strange thing was when my Dad had an x ray of his chest in later life his chest was clear. I was expecting enough tar to tarmac my local motorway
"My M & D both went cold turkey when we were little kids, they managed.I don't remember them doing it as such, BUTI do vaguely remember them smoking when I was tiny, but not when I was a bit older....Stick with it Lily - you will not ever regret it.Cheers to you from me!Edited: 11:38 am, April 23, 2020 "
I quit cold turkey about 30 years ago. It was the third time I’d quit for a year or more. The first time I thought it would be ok to have the odd puff in social situations. It wasn’t. Soon I was bumming the odd cigarette and eventually started buying them again. I found the first three days was hard. Whenever I had a craving I’d go outside and work in the garden or get some sort of exercise. After a few weeks the physical addiction is gone but you still miss the ritual. In the evening if I really wanted a smoke I’d light up a joint which has no nicotine. Eventually I’d get tired and fall asleep. I’m cured now and don’t even mind a little second hand smoke. It’s my guilty pleasure :) Good luck with your quitting.
Oh I am so opposite second hand smoke really really bothers me. Yes the emotional part of smoking is hard to give up.
"I just remembered, chewing cinnamon flavoured gum was a big help.and eating apples they contain a form of nicotine.Edited: 12:31 pm, April 23, 2020 "
Here is a list of foods that contain nicotine.https:/…6-common-food-with-nicotine-content
"i quite about three months ago in Havana cold turkey. be ready for a nasty six weeks of heartburn. mine was real bad.Just keep busy. When I went to Havana i just walked passed the duty free at the airport here and said I wasn't going to grab a carton . Smoking three cigars a day helped but now that I am back home, I notice the smokers stink......won't be me"
"Well done Lilly!I tried as I reckoned I don't have the emotional triggers in lockdown................but didn't make it.However now I'm walking instead of driving and it's so beautiful with the clean clear air I'm smoking a lot less. Yes, always found the first 3 days hard.The last time I gave up I substituted with custard and chocolate doughnuts :-)"
"Since there is a report that smokers are less likely to get the Wuhan Flu, maybe you should wait to quit."
"Well sounds like you are already there, so don't go backward :) My advice would have been about cutting down slowly, smoking less, then skipping days, etc. but seems you are pasts that.Since you have quit already just keep on moving forward!! Change things around your home. Don't sit in the same place you used to smoke at the times you are used to having a cigarette. Rearrange the furniture, don't pour that drink/wine/whatever and sit in the same place where you typically light up. Try to change up more in your daily habits and patterns than just not smoking, is what I'm trying to express. suerte, suze"
"My parents, both heavy smokers for 40 years each, quit cold turkey back in the 60s. My dad used hard candy to get by. Saved his life when he had a massive heart attack 10 years later, according to the doctors. My father in law never quit, always claimed his doctors said his lungs were perfect. He died at 60 of throat cancer. My mother in law never quit. Her last years were miserable. Bad circulation from smoking resulting in wounds in her toes that would not heal, resulting in their amputation. She died of congestive heart failure, still smoking to the last. I know it’s hard. I quit early, while I was on my way to being hooked. I think it’s great when smokers realize what they are doing. Do. Not. Start. Again."
"Gave up 26 years ago by going cold turkey, third time lucky.I had given up for one year & then for four years but like Walker thought I had it beat and could be an occasional smoker.It took about a week until I bought a packet and was hooked again.I joined the ""quit"" program here, they sent me a booklet which had some very handy tips and some graphic pictures of damaged lungs. Every time I felt like one, I opened the book and looked at the photos.If I was at work, I'd get up from my desk and walk around the building, go outside and smell fresh air.If I was home, I'd go for a walk. Took about three weeks and I gradually thought or craved them less and less. I started saving the money I would normally spend on cigarettes for a holiday, great incentive.I cannot stand the smell now not even second hand smoke and especially stale smoke on peoples breath and clothes.I would never start again, one of the worst things I ever did was smoke and one of the best things I ever did was quit.Keep going it gets easier, make sure you tell a lot of people that you have given up, it makes you accountable and also stops people trying to tempt you. Don't know why but people do.After I gave up it started a chain reaction amongst my family and friends and five others were able to quit, none of them have restarted."
"Something I heard a long time ago, and have always thought may help-When you get the craving, postpone it for 10 minutes. That means you are possibly losing one cigarette a day, and the better you feel doing it, the longer you make the time.Set an alarm for when you are 'allowed' to have one. If you can resist, go a bit more. If you can't, then you have postponed it for a while, and should be on your way to longer gaps.Good luck. Day 4 of cold turkey is impressive, in these times.BTW, I thought smoking was a big problem for Covid sufferers, not a saver?"
"Congratulations to you!! Keep it up.My mom smoked for 60 years, she's 88 and finally quit using the patch."
"#25, everyone In my parents’ generation smoked (I’m in my 60s, too), with rare exceptions. Two of my older sisters smoked, their friends and boyfriends, and some of my friends. My parents discouraged it, but in college it was common, and I actually enjoyed it, but did it mainly hanging out with friends. Professors and students could smoke in class. If I’d kept on, I probably would have been hooked. My last girlfriend, who I married over 40 years ago, said kissing guys who smoked was probably like “kissing an ashtray”.So I stopped, but on rare occasions would borrow a cigarette. I don’t know anyone who smokes now.Edited: 12:00 am, April 24, 2020 "
"I was a fairly heavy smoker and had tried to quit many many times. I then read the book by Allan Carr, easy way to quit smoking. That was in 2011 and I have not had a cigarette since then. It kind of rewires your brain, you brainwash yourself into believing that you actually want and enjoy smoking, it does not work for everyone, but I have passed the book onto a few other people who have also managed to quit after reading it. Good luck and you wont regret quitting if you manage it, it literally changed my life."
I was a social smoker when out having a drink or whatever and I smoked while driving. Smoking while driving was my big thing. I found that keeping my hands busy helped a lot. I kept a bottle of water in the car and would take a sip when I felt the need to light up. Seemed to help me mentally.
"I think it's brilliant all these non smoking places, the number of times I used to have people on the next table holding their cigarette away from their table, only to put it under my nose.One person did this so badly, even after asking them very politely, that I asked for a glass of water, and the next time they did it, I gave their cigarette a drink!!!"
"My late father was a smoker and was always in denial about the harm it caused. When we visited his home village in China, I discovered that all of the men in my family (except me) were smokers. I also discovered that in China, at least in those days, smoking was very much a male thing. It seemed that all of the men smoked, and all of the women didn't. I do not know if this has changed more recently."
"Lilly, well done. I hope you haven't started again since you posted. Can you please let us know how you are going?As hard as it is, whatever you do, don't have one more smoke. Many people make the mistake of thinking that they can have just one. In vast majority of cases, people that have just one, start smoking again.Everybody is different and each person has to find the best way for them to quit.I grew up with tobacco, as my family grew it for sale. I never had any desire to even try it. Then I met my wife, who was a smoker. Other people around me, were all smokers. Sure enough, I gradually became a smoker, but never a heavy one. I gave up when I realised that at the end of every weekend I had a headache. I concluded that it was because I smoked more than usual. I continued smoking socially for many years. I haven't had one for the last 6 years and never will. My wife found it harder to quit. She tried reducing it down to a few smokes a day. That didn't work. She then went cold turkey. She only had one each time our kids got married. That is what she said she would do when she gave up. She hated it. On the other hand, I know people who crave it sometimes 20 years after they gave up, but know that they cannot have it. BTW, I lost my brother prematurely due to heavy smoking all his adult life. He was a chain smoker. He had a stroke while working and was dead on the spot. If it wasn't for smoking, he had many good years left in him. I am still angry at him 17 months after he died."
Not sure why I started. My parents were both tea totalers and my dad was allowed to smoke a pipe but only in his car. I don’t really remember when or why I started. Ten years at about a pack a day. Glad I quit.
"I have never smoked, but my husband started as a teenager. He tried to quit two times, using Nicorette, but didn't stick to it. In March of 1997, we ran into a guy he used to work with, who had retired. He was pulling an oxygen tank AND smoking at the same time! My husband told me that he doesn't ever want to be like that. On that day in March, he picked out a date in the future to quit, my birthday in May. On my birthday, 23 years ago, he quit and has never gone back! His success also inspired my best friend, and also his best friend, to quit, and neither of them have ever gone back to smoking again. So for him, it was not ever wanting to be 'that guy' with an oxygen tank and still smoking!Edited: 7:18 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"UPDATE: Thank you all for your kind remarks and comments. Well, I still haven't given in to temptation. Was a little worried Saturday night because the hubby and I had a few drinkies thought I might get tempted. But no I was a very good girl. Even Hubby is totally surprised at what I've done and has said he is very proud of me. I still cold turkey by the way.Edited: 7:47 am, April 27, 2020 "
You are doing extremely well Lilly. Keep it up. It is worth it.
"Brilliant, Lilly!! You deserve to be proud of yourself!"

I might take up smoking...four pages of bump ups this morning...enough to get on anyone's nerves...but I guess that's the point to annoy us. I wish someone would find a new hobby....ridiculous.
"All I can offer you is my admiration, support and encouragement, Lilly!I am probably one of not too many people who never even tried smoking... I grew up in the non-smoking family and I do not even want to think about my Dad’s reaction had he ever caught me smoking a cigarette. Almost all my friends smoked, and some of them continued all their lives. Now they are paying the price, and unfortunately one of my close friends paid the ultimate price... it was way too early for her to go... I am still trying to accept the fact that she is gone forever and it makes me so incredibly sad."
Lilly hasn't been back. This is here only because of being topped from the daily spammer.
"My fingers are crossed that you've been successful in your goal to stop smoking, Lilly. I went cold turkey and failed twice, but the third time proved to be the charm.I had been a heavy smoker for 20 years and tried to stop twice. The first time I started again within two weeks. The second time, I lasted two years. On March 10, 1980, I stopped for good. I had chronic bronchitis then and knew there would be more health issues ahead. So I focused on health. At the end of the first week without a cigarette, I went to a lung-cancer lecture at a local hospital. The photos, videos of interviews with those dying and detailed descriptions of what to expect by the physician presenter did the trick. Eventually, I actually became allergic to cigarette smoke. Forty years later, I still have an occasional craving but never even consider lighting up."
"What is the screen name of the daily spammer? All his/her posts have been removed. I suspect one but I am not sure. Also, today I started getting the recaptcha message. Have you received it too?"
"The daily spammer (today) was put on vacation, so there no longer is a name attached. But, not to worry. Tomorrow , he/she might show up with a different name. Thanks to them, yesterday’s topics where all on page six, when I first checked this morning."
I was not switching devices though.

"I started smoking as a teenager in the 50's when it was considered ""cool"" and everyone did it. I was never a heavy smoker, maybe 10 a day or perhaps more if I was at a party. Cigarettes certainly contribute to a hangover I discovered. I smoked until the early 90's when I got a very bad throat infection. I couldn't drink or eat, let alone smoke. When the infection left so had the desire for cigarettes. I'm very thankful to that sore throat, especially when I see the price people are paying for a packet of cigarettes. I've seen people at the supermarkets pay over $35 for a pack of 20. I couldn't afford that now even if I wanted to."
Wow Mollets $35 a pack? Another plus for giving up:)
I wonder if Lilly (our OP) quit smoking?
Hopefully Lilly will update us one day Suze.
"I know two hard core 3 pack a day smokers who quit using hypnosis. It worked first try for both of them. I'm not a smoker, never was, but I'd sure give this a try if I needed it.Both hypnotists are registered medical doctors, not quacks."
