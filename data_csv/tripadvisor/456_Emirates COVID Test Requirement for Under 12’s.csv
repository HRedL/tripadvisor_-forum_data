"We have just checked in for our LHR-DXB-MLE flights. Initially Emirates tried to refuse check in as our 2 under 12’s did not have a valid COVID negative test - I then insisted that this is irrelevant as the Emirates policy is that under 12’s do not require them. They then stated it is a rule from the Maldives - I insisted they rang for authority to refuse us, which they did, and then confirmed we were checked in !Not the best start to a well deserved break for my wife - but stress is now over and we are waiting for lunch to arrive. Richard from PurelyMaldives"
This is interesting and good luck with your journey Richard.
"Oh Richard, I bet that caused a bit of panic. No surprise though, judging by comments I have read from various people booked with Emirates who were given contradictory answers by Customer Services when querying whether or not a test is required.Anyway you can relax now and enjoy your trip. Bon voyage,"
"Yup. Sat on the plane right now - short of some burly coppers coming onboard we are definitely getting as far as Dubai!Wow - what an adventure - but, I think we’ve got off lightly considering what some people have been thru in the past 5 months. Best wishes to anybody travelling or thinking of travelling now - you will face some difficult choices, nobody can say you were right or wrong - it is only you that truly knows your circumstances. Signing off until I hopefully step onto Maldivian soil. Richard from PurelyMaldives"
Safe travels Richard and family. Have a lovely time on Amilla.
"Blimey Richard, what a palaver. Hopefully by the time you read this the stress will be a distant memory. Wishing you, Jess and the boys a safe journey and the fabulous break you deserve."
"Oh gosh what a terrible start ! I hope you all have a wonderful time, I hope you will post your experience once your home, I’m intrigued to know how it all goes . Take care and have fun"
not the start you would have wished for but a bit of ducking and diving and you are on your way - have amazing time and keep us updated on your journey
"Safe and happy travels Richard and family, enjoy every second of your well deserved break!.....and please keep the updates coming xox"
"Jeez not what you need when you know more than they do!!I think this is a problem with the Emirates checkin system it doesnt know that under 12s dont need a test - the guy checking us in pressed 'no' on his screen to 'does the customer have a negative covid test' for our 8yr old and the whole thing shut down and refused to check us in! He knew it was OK though so went and had someone else manually fix it, sounds like we got lucky there! Forgot to include that in my write up.Hope the rest of your journey is smooth, we've got a great view across the sea from our Villa to the Amilla sea villas, its a beautiful (if a tad windy!) day in paradise today, will keep an eye out for your seaplane!"
"HiWe have landed in paradise. Thankyou for all of your kind wishes. After LHR everything else has been a breeze. The Emirates lounge at LHR is shut so we had an enjoyable breakfast in a cafe. Lounge in DXB is open but serving a much pared down food offering - though still lovely to relax and enjoy a snack. Our plane was less than 20% full. Immigration and Passport Control at Velana was well manned - but the staff have a huge amount of data to check and enter so the process was lengthy. Our bags were on the carousel when we were finished - then out to the humidity. First flight with Manta Maldives on a very new (but still hot) seaplane. COVID tested once arrived on Amilla (negative) and another one due in 3 days to grant is freedom to roam the island. We have a lovely large villa with pool and a great butler Gondo who will ensure we are happy and well fed until we can visit the restaurants ourselves. Now sleep and relaxation...ThanksRichard from PurelyMaldivesEdited: 9:23 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Wow, that's really a lot of inconveniene til now! Wish you a pleasant vacation and interested in further updates from you, how the resort handles the Corona precautionary measurements...."
Interesting... I thought amilla changed the rules and you are now able to roam the island starting from your second day if you test negative at the airport?https:/…AF_Guest_Arrival_Procedure.pdf
Hello SevidlamThe central testing system became overrun with too many tests. Amilla has testing on site and we will be free to roam after a couple of days. The situation will change back to a shorter system as central testing is ramped up again. ThanksRichard from PurelyMaldives
"I am aware that Emirates requires testing Covid 19 to board planes.So far, everything I have read states that Qatar Airways does not require any testing nor is any testing necessary to enter the Maldives.So, our September trip (I hope) will be through Qatar, does that mean we don't need to do any tests?Can someone confirm this to me?"
"Hi Vitor, I hope you are well. At the moment it is only the emirate states within the UAE that require a COVID-19 PCR test before you travel to the UAE. Therefore anyone flying to/via Dubai (e.g with Emirates airline) or flying to/via Abu Dhabi (e.g. with Etihad airline) will require the COVID-19 PCR test before departure and return.Edited: 6:05 am, August 06, 2020 "
"Thank you Lynphd, good to know.I hope there will be no changes by September."
"Hi Vitor, keep checking things regularly. Things seem to change at short notice. There is a health screening form to fill out before you travel, but I guess you know about that.Edited: 7:00 am, August 06, 2020 "
"Lynphd, I've read about that health screening form but I'm not sure where to find it.Is this form common to all travelers regardless of nationality?"
"Hi Vitor, I think you should be able to find what you need if you put your details into this page:https:/…visa-and-passport-requirements.html"
"Hi Vitor, I just checked and the health screening details (for anyone entering or departing the Maldives) are here:https://imuga.immigration.gov.mv""Traveller Health DeclarationIn accordance to health requirements all travellers travelling to and from Maldives are required to submit a self-declarative health declaration within 24 hours prior to their travel."""
Thank you Lynphd.This was a great help.
