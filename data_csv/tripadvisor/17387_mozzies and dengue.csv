"hi we are flying out to sal next week, how many mozzzies are about this time of year? and how many cases of dengue have been reported?"
Very few mozzies in town right now - maybe more at hotels near vegetation? No cases of dengue reported on Sal for a long time.
thanks for that
"we are also planning to travel to SAL in february, and have a young daughter who is not yet one year old, can you advise if there are risks to her due to the dengue fever outbreak?also would you advise any precautions against the mosquitos?is it neccesary?regardsAndy"
"we are off to sal too on 8th feb but we are concerned about the recent dengue epidemic and rather annoyed thompson kept it quiet, any news would be most welcome"
"we are just back from the garopa today. we took a plug in repellant for the room, and also got a mozzie net for our 5 year old daughter. (we used a tall lamp that was in the room to drape it over and then weighted down at the bottom end with towels, which worked really well, we also plastered her in a boots insect repellant (with 50% deet). over the whole week, i had 1 insect bite and we only had 1 mozzie in our room, which disappeared quite quickly (presumably it was killed by our plug-in).on the thomson board (in reception) they did have some information regarding dengue!!! just covering their backsides maybe? i think they should give customers the full sp on the situation, even if they just say there is nothing to worry about.just have a good time, i'm sure you will."
thanks for the response. I think the situaation was bad in the rainy season but sounds to have largely abated so we feel more relaxed now!
