"Hello,I am from India and I had planned a trip to Italy in Mid March. But due to the conditions there because of corona virus, I am not allowed to fly there.I was wondering, can I cancel my tickets for colosseum and Vatican museums and get a refund ?I have the 39 Euro ticket for Vatican and 23 Euro ticket for Colosseum.I have also booked 15 Euro ticket for the Last Supper in Milan.Any way to cancel these and get refund ?"
You need to contact whoever you bought the tickets from.
"I have sent a mail to all of them, but I didnt get any reply.I have also purchased train tickets from Milan to Venice (Italo), Venice to Rome (TrenItalia) and Rome to Milan (Italo)They were economy tickets, hence not refundable.But due to a special situation now in Italy, can I get a refund for those as well ?"
"Concerning Trenitalia ticket refunds, Read:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…"
Thanks GAC. I have submitted the request.Please let me know any other such policies/updates where I can get any kind of refund.

"Probably so from the Colosseum but given the the Vatican is not in Italy, does this edict apply to them as well - I suspect they will also make this decision but I've not yet read it anywhere (unless, of course, I missed it) I didn't see it on their official website early this a.m. Anyone have confirmation this is also the case with the Vatican?"
">>given the the Vatican is not in Italy, does this edict apply to them as well <<GAC reported that the Vatican Museums were adhering to the edict in this other thread. https:/…105924364Edited: 12:27 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Thanks Drew - they don't have a notice of it up yet on their website but I just went to their site and got to a page that says they are doing site maintenance so maybe they are updating with new infoI'm guessing there is lots of chaos happening around this issue in the venues given it is the weekend
Will be looking for Colosseum refund too given it’s now closed for our booking of €39 x 2 tour. Vatican was half the price of that so if i at least get one then I have a better chance if the more expensive one.
"I have the same situation all hotels , attraction tickets and flights for Venice , Florence , Rome and Napoli have been booked and I don't know how to get refund. Almost the whole trip already paid. And no US announced Level 4 as travel alert . Any Ideas or news , let me know."
"Pouyan A:You will need to take each transaction one by one. Some transactions will require action or a decision on your part while others will be automatically refunded. Just browse the threads on the Italy forum from the last few days. There are dedicated threads to most airlines with their latest policy. There have been a few other travelers that wrote how they cancelled their trip indicating which transactions were easy to cancel / refund and which transactions were more difficultEdited: 6:09 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"This appears on the Vatican Museum site today:NoticeVatican Museums closed to the publicDear visitors, having acknowledged the Decree of the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic of 8 March 2020 art.2 letter d), we would like to inform you that, for precautionary measures, from today the Vatican Museums will remain closed to the public. We regret any inconvenience caused and, in case of need, we invite you to write to the email address help.musei@scv.va for any request or assistance. Any further contact information is available on this website. Vatican City State, 9 March 2020"
"FYI for those wondering about Colosseum cancellation between now and April 3rd, I just received this email:Per effetto del DPCM dell’8 marzo 2020, valido fino al 3 aprile 2020, che vede la chiusura dei musei e degli altri istituti e luoghi della cultura, Coopculture sospende, temporaneamente, il servizio di informazione e prenotazione telefonica e di vendita on line. Sul sito saranno pubblicati aggiornamenti relativi alla ripresa dei servizi ordinari.CoopCulture è in attesa da parte del MIBACT, titolare del servizio e diretto beneficiario degli introiti di biglietteria, di indicazioni sulla possibilità di effettuare o meno i rimborsi, e/o proporre soluzioni alternative.As a result of the Prime Ministerial Decree of 8 March 2020, valid until 3 April 2020, which includes the closure of museums and other cultural institutions and venues, Coopculture is temporarily suspending the telephone information and booking service and online sales. Updates relating to the resumption of ordinary services will be published on the website.CoopCulture is waiting for MIBACT, the owner of the service and direct beneficiary of the ticketing revenue, to provide information on the possibility to make refunds or not, and/or to propose alternative solutions."
"I was wondering if anyone has experience with refunds from the Vatican Museums. My ticket clearly states: ""Tickets are not refundable"" and their announcement doesn't mention anything about a refund.Should I just wait or make a charge dispute to my bank ?"
Nick H:Why would you make a charge dispute with your bank? That comment doesn't make any sense.I think the answer will depend on what you plan to do - are you going to postpone your trip to a later date or cancel altogether?
The colosseum will automatically refund tours and tickets. This may take a while because of the volume of tickets involved but they will refund you. The Vatican has also closed due to the decree. They will also be issuing refunds or changing dates. There is NO NEED to do a charge back. Just wait for the process to complete itself. They are working on refunding everyone. Donna
"Drew: My bank (through my credit card) has already charged me with the tickets and since I won't receive this service (not my fault) I can dispute the transaction. I cancelled the trip altogether.dbabe: If the process takes too long I won't have the opportunity to make a dispute, the transaction will be considered finite and my bank won't allow me to do anything. So, if the refund doesn't happen in the end, I'll just lose my money. That's why I asked if anyone has ever received a refund from the Vatican Museums."
"Donna - Please provide a link if you have additional information regarding Colosseum refunds. In my post below (#14) I posted the actual email we who, are currently holding Colosseum tickets, received from coopculture instead of speculating as you may haveEdited: 9:35 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Nick H:However, if you were to make a dispute with your bank without making any attempt to contact the Vatican Museums, that is considered consumer fraud by the card holder. Maybe your prior response was just incomplete."
"Nick H:Since the Vatican Museums has decided to enact the closure decree from the Italian government, they should refund the ticket purchase for those with tickets for the affected dates. If it gives you peace of mind, you can try to email them to inquire about the status of the refund - although be sure to have some patience because refunding a month's tickets will be a massive undertaking. They cannot just snap their fingers and it will be all done. I am sure their email inbox is also overflowing with messages and questions."
"Ruth, I am not speculating. Refunds or alternates dates will be offered for those effected. In either case, it may take a while because of the volume of tickets/tours involved. Donna"
"I've already contacted the museum (before even they issued the cancellation note), there is no reply yet."
"Nick H:Even if a very small percentage of ticket holders decide to email - that equates to thousands of emails. Have a little patience. You should also monitor your spam / junk folder as well. If you don't normally send + receive emails from the Vatican Museums, your email provider may flag the email as fraud and either place it in spam / junk or return the message back to the Vatican Museums and completely block the message from reaching your email account. There is one popular email service that many people use that advertises this block and return as a ""benefit."" Most people don't realize that their email provider is doing this ""service."" I avoid using this particular email provider at times because of this ""benefit""Edited: 11:24 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Donna - Your earlier post stated, ""The colosseum will automatically refund tours and tickets,"" and it is that statement to which I question, because that is not what the official Coopculture email we (who hold expensive March tour tickets for our families) received. I see your later post now uses the phrasing ""Refunds or alternates dates will be offered."" We on this board very much value your input, and a voucher (which is what ""alternate date"" means to me) for later travel is different, at least to me, than a refund. I have not yet contacted my credit card to request a charge back for any expense, this one included; I must though prior to my Colosseum tour date or I risk having no standing.Edited: 11:38 am, March 11, 2020 "
"A refund or a different date will be offered. They are not saying they won't give a refund and that you must accept an alternate date. They are stating you can choose one or the other. Everyone I've spoken to about this says they are working on the process. They must refund or give alternate dates to everyone who purchased, this process takes time. Donna"

Thanks for your input Hanna. I've send an e-mail yesterday to the same help.musei@scv.va with the voucher attached and still no reply from them.

"Hi all I was able to cancel our tickets for the Colosseum through the company we booked them with no problem, was not hopeful about cancelling and getting a refund for the Vatican tickets as their policy clearly says no refunds under any circumstances, however I emailed them at help.musei@scv.va giving all the details including the booking reference and explaining why we have had to cancel and they replied within 24 hours with Dear visitor,The refund procedure has been activated on your behalf for the booking code -----------------------------------The refund will be issued on your credit card within 60 days of processing the payment.See you soon.__________________________________________Ufficio Servizi e Rapporti con il PubblicoMusei Vaticani Very happy with this outcome"
"You don't need to contact any of these companies. They are processing refunds as quickly as they can. Contacting them could slow up the process so, please, just be patient. They will get around to everyone.Donna"
Kudos to the Vatican Museums for handling this so quickly amidst all the corona virus epidemic chaos.I also received an email confirming the refund on my tickets.
"#34 ""Hi all I was able to cancel our tickets for the Colosseum through the company we booked them with no problem""Did you book directly with Coopculture, and if so, how did you cancel, there is no information on their website other than that they are aware of problem (or did you book with a third-party who has graciously refunded you)?

Thank you, appreciate your posting"
Perhaps I missed it but cant seem to find any info from Coopculture on refunds
Regarding the Scavi Vatican underground tour I received an email they are saying that they will credit you but will take 2-3 months. Regarding tickets purchased directly from the colosseum there website on 9 March states they are deciding IF they will issue credits. No update since.
"I agree with the previous two posters regarding the Colosseum, and am now skeptical of earlier poster"
"Sharing my experience for those who have booked tickets directly on the official Vatican website.We had a tour booked for 27 Mar, and had not yet requested for a refund (as we were busy following up on the bigger items flights, hotels etc.). However, to our pleasant surprise received the following email today.Gentile visitatore,abbiamo avviato la procedura di rimborso per la sua prenotazione XXXXEntro 60 giorni riceverà sulla sua carta di credito gli importi pagati.Arrivederci a presto.Dear visitor,The refund procedure has been activated on your behalf for the booking code XXX.The refund will be issued on your credit card within 60 days of processing the payment.See you soon.__________________________________________Ufficio Servizi e Rapporti con il PubblicoMusei VaticaniWould request everyone to be patient and not flood them with emails as they seem to be issuing refunds automatically.Will update once I see the money credited!Re Colosseum, there is no official notification yet, I plan to reach out around the 25th if there is no update by then, as my booking is for the 28th"
There is no need to reach out to them. They have sold thousands and thousands of tickets and are working on a solution for refunds. Contacting them just means something else they have to do and takes away from them working on a solution. Give them time. Let them work it out and start the process. If people keep inundating them with emails and phone calls it will take even longer.Donna

Also had Vatican refund mail but am putting Colosseum through on insurance due to lack of clarity. Their only comms is non committal and was nearly a week ago now - if I leave it too long I won’t be able to claim. They should be able to make a decision in a week whether they are going to refund or not & then simply issue another holding statement saying they will be processed in due course...
iExplore1985I would give them more time (being mindful of your insurance deadline).Unless your ultimate goal is to double dip and receive a refund from CoopCulture and your insurance company and profit on the cancellation
"https:/…The Colosseum has this post ^It states ""The communications concerning requests for reimbursements must be sent online and addressed to: reservations@coopculture.it.""I just did as directed, sent to the address provided, and it was bounced back as not in service. Wishing other March 2020 ticket holders better luck than I, and thank you in advance for sharing anything you learn further. The contrast with the Vatican's auto refunding is starkEdited: 5:06 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Ruth K:I think if you just wait a few days, there will be a further announcement on the CoopCulture website"
Well no insurance claim for me..... my excess is more than the total I would be claiming back! So either credit card chargeback or wait..
"I just received an unsolicited refund from the Vatican for a tour I booked for 13 April. It just appeared in my email. I had never bothered to contact them as the site says no refunds. Still waiting for SAS to cancel my flight on 4 April, though..."
"Seems likely that no action is needed for any and all who have bought Vatican tickets, there are many many posts now to demonstrate that they have put an automatic credit card refund process in place. Such is not the case for Colosseum ticket holders at this time, kuddos to the Vatican, though...and time will tell, we wait...Edited: 12:13 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Coopculture handles sites in 9 different areas, they don't just handle the colosseum. You are expecting them to be able to respond the same way the Vatican has responded when the Vatican is only responsible for The Vatican and not so many different places.Just be patient and give them time. They will work out a solution. Any refund is, in my opinion, a bonus because all tickets/tours sold are sold as non-refundable. I'm sure they're doing their best with the limited staffing they have. You must remember that Italy is under lock down and people are not supposed to be leaving their homes. Donna"
"""Any refund is, in my opinion, a bonus because all tickets/tours sold are sold as non-refundable. "" Yes, dbabe, that is your opinion."
"**Yes, dbabe, that is your opinion.**As I stated, it IS my opinion. You did, after all, buy tickets that are non-refundable and they are doing the best they can under the circumstances. They are working on either refunding or rescheduling tickets. Coopculture services more than just the colosseum so it may take a while to process refunds or make schedule adjustments. Donna"
"Actually if you read the no-refund policy, there’s a statement that make it refundable in extraordinary circumstances. With that said, gonna need to allow time for responses and decisions. Contact credit card provider to see if you have travellers insurance. All my excursions in Rome and Greece are covered."
"Last night on MIBACT site it was an announcement with a lot of measures for covid 19 Misure extraordinare per tourism...I copy an extras in original languageProbably it will be for colosseum alsoVOUCHER PER BIGLIETTI CINEMA, TEATRI, MUSEI E CONCERTII rimborsi con voucher già previsti per viaggi e pacchetti turistici annullati a seguito dell’emergenza Covid-19 vengono estesi anche ai biglietti per spettacoli, cinema, teatri, musei e altri luoghi della cultura."
HelloHas anyone have any info about colosseum refund or rebook ?Thank you!
Catinca E:It has only been 2 weeks since the government decree announcing the forced closure. While I understand that you want an expedient resolution to the matter....you need to realize that this is a very big undertaking. A month's worth of tickets is a very large chunk of change. The funds will need to be identified. A process will need to be set-up. Employees are required to stay at home from work. Also - CoopCulture administers other attractions in addition to the Colosseum.
"Hi everyone,There is now an update on the Coopculture page for all sites administered by them. Check here - https://www.coopculture.it/en/#It is under the News section dated 29 March. The refund will be in the form of a voucher with 1 year validity from the time the sites reopen.The link to apply for the refund voucher is https://voucher.coopculture.it/Incidentally, we should have been at the Colosseum on 29 March, hoping and praying for the Italians, and for us to be able to actually use it!"
"I have tickets for April 19th, but our trip is cancelled. I tried to get the voucher, but I couldn’t do it because I got a message saying that our date was after April 3rd. Has anybody done this with dates after April 3rd?"
"mxtravelingirl - The lockdown was until 3rd April, now extended until 12 April. You could wait and see, the date may get extended given the current situation, or if your country does not allow you to travel on that day, that should be a valid reason too, as per the 5 points mentioned on their site."
"Preetha11, oh, ok I get it now. I read it over and over and I couldn’t find a date range for the tickets, so I thought it was for all tickets. But I did see the points outlined there where you are asked to send an email with proof, so I guess now that those are for other dates.Thank you for your help.Edited: 9:01 am, March 31, 2020 "

Thank you Drew for your insight. Makes sense and hopefully they will post soon an update.
