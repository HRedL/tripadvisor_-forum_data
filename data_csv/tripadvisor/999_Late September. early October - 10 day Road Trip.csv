"My wife and I are planning a road trip for September - October, roughly 3 weeks. I have plotted a loop Indy to South Dakota Bad Lands/Black Hills (4 nights), Yellowstone/Grand Tetons (5 nights), south to Utah (10 or so nights), then back to Indy.I am looking for suggestions on 10 days in Utah with maybe a peek into Arizona or Colorado. I have read about places like Zion, Bryce, Cedar Breaks, Red Cliffs, Capital Reef, Arches, Canyonland, and others. We will likely not do Mesa Verde this trip.We want to be safe (Covid-19) and we are 76 and 70 years old. The good news: I love to drive and see the pretty places of the world. Likely light hiking.Recommendations for itinerary, scenic drives, and places to stay?"
"""We want to be safe (Covid-19) and we are 76 and 70 years old"" Clay ask yourself a question - Will there be covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines available before my trip? therapeutics? possibly vaccines? not by Sept - Oct. You are in the most vulnerable age risk group. Why would you be planning such a trip? Stay home and be safe !!"
"Clay, how exciting!! I'm looking to go for only a week, around Sept. I'm 56, hubby 57, so we're not in the non safe age zone for COVID. However, me personally, I believe when ti's your time to go (die), nothing will stop it. We're not promised tomorrow, go and enjoy! And yes, be cautious while out and about. I wish I had suggestions for you, I'm in need myself, LOL. ."
"Gail,Got it - so if Clay and his wife or you and your husband acquire COVID-19 on your trips spread the virus as you travel place to place to others in Utah or if any of you require hospitalization you are OK with spreading the virus and also depriving needed bed space for the rural communities you plan to visit. Many of these rural hospitals have few ICU beds.Gail, here is a suggestion for you - stay away from communities impacted by the virus surrounding many of the national parks in Utah until there is a vaccine or proven therapeutics for COVID-19.Edited: 4:22 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Actually, except for Moab, non of the small rural towns near the national parks have hospitals. The closest hospital may be hours away."
"Following up from your post on Road Trips. Here's a suggested Utah plan.Day 1 - Drive down from Grand Tetons to Park City, Utah for one nightDay 2 - Drive from Park City to Moab; stay in downtown areaDay 3 - ArchesDay 4 - CanyonlandsDay 5 - Drive to Torrey (Capitol Reef)Day 6 - Drive scenic route 12 to Bryce Canyon; stay Bryce Lodge or one of Best Westerns at gateDay 7 - Bryce sunrise then drive to Springdale (Zion)Day 8 - Explore Zion (presently canyon shuttle is not running making it very challenging to visit)Day 9 - ZionDay 10 - Drive to Grand Canyon North Rim (check to see if lodging is available; you're also near end of season there)Day 11/12 - Start your drive back east via southern ColoradoHave fun."
"Kane County Hospital in Kanab which we have passed through (through Kanab that is) going between parks.Edited: 2:19 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"""Have fun"" in Utah where there is a virus pandemic that is accelerating in the state. If the pandemic is still strong or there is a second wave in the autumn do postpone your trip to protect you and others."
