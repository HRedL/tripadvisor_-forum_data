"While in Culebra I brought home an unwanted sourvenier.... a mosquito gave it to me. It is Dengue Fever. I got sick 6 days after being home and have had a fever for 21 days straight. I am very tired and need to rest on and off all day. My joints take turns hurting for about 24 hourseach. My doctor did a blood test that confirmed it. There is no treatment, just time. I wish someone had told be to use DEET!"
"that is life in the tropics my friend! you are lucky your physician tested you (most US physicians do not know how to handle or treat dengue and think is a bad cold, i know a few horror stories). i recommed using deet if you are staying a week or so. I live here and using deet and poisoning my skin for 5 months every year is out of the question, we simply take care of not having breeding places and spraying rooms if you catch a mosquito. last year i got the dengue, first time in my lifetime, i was in bed for a whole week, i thought i was going to die, thats how bad i felt. last year the dengue cases were higher than unusual, meaning our gov. is not doing it's job, it needs to spray around.drink a lot of water, aloe juice is great also.Edited: 9 years ago "
"also, please for those reading about Dengue Fever, do not use Aspirin if you think you catched dengue. if you have dengue, it could be dengue type 2 (hemorrhagic type) (how do you know which type is it? thru a test, that is how you know) it can be life threatning the use of aspirin.Edited: 9 years ago "
"wow we hate mosquitoes thanks for the information - I really hope you feel better, that is so sad- I've heard dengue being very painful....God Bless.... we just read another review that stated Off with DEET didn't ward off the mosquitoes either -"
"I am with you all the way--! and I think many folks on Culebra ""minimize"" the risk and reality. Also, I now know dozens of people who live here who have finally admitted to me that they have had it.I contracted dengue fever in Feb. 2011. I was told by the host of the Guest House where I was staying that I did not have dengue fever. All I can say is: What an idiot.Symptoms; I had a temp of 103, the bones in my body ached everywhere, including my hands, and I got a very odd, red rash on my chest which did not go away for weeks. (I also had an a typical case and continued to get temps of 102 every 2 to 3 days for 6 weeks.)Important to know: You can get dengue fever 365 days a year on Culebra. There are different types of dengue fever, and once you have had it, you are more susceptible to the other types, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (from which you can die.) The mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever are out during the day. Insect repellent with DEET is the only effective protection.Further, the CDC currently identifies Puerto Rico and Culebra as in epidemic status with to dengue fever. (You can check this on the CDC website.)Take precautions!By the way, I have come back to Culebra twice since originally contracting dengue fever, so I am by no means attempting to vilify the island, but I wish I had known that it was such a serious issue and risk."
Is this a Culebra issue? We're going to the main island in a few weeks and I happen to get lots of mosquito bites.
Dengue is prevelant throughout the tropics. Everywhere. Check the CDC Gov site.
"Thanks. I see the T&C (so far our favorite destination) doesn't have this problem, but I guess it's technically not in the Caribbean. ;)"
"Some countries in the caribbean have controlled Dengue very well (Cuba has done a great job controlling the mosquito), Puerto Rico is not one of those, in 2010 the epidemic was horrible here , in Dominican Republic and Guadalupe.Edited: 9 years ago "
"our press reports second death of Dengue in less than 2 weeks, there are now reported 10 cases of the hemorragic type of Dengue which is the most dangerous if not treated. there are two types of Dengue.elnuevodia.com/seconfirmasegundamuertepordenâ€¦"
"In 2010 the epidemic was horrible? Are you serious? Holy hyperbole.El Nuevo Dia as usual trying to cause panic to sell newspapers. Tons and tons of people get dengue. It's just a part of it. Death resulting in it is so low it's not a big issue. Every year more people die of the common flu which you can catch anywhere.If you get dengue, which I got when I was young, just follow the same things you would do with any flu or fever. I spent some time in bed and got better. No big deal and I've never gotten it again and I don't know anyone who's gotten it in a long time."
"Aleks, i am glad you did not get dengue last year, i did and a coworker of mine too and had to go to the hospital to get tested to see which type of dengue i had, not fun at all. do a Google search: dengue epidemic puerto rico 2010there is a lot of info, MSNBC and BBC did also a story about it last year.Edited: 8 years ago "
HiThe CDC does not use death as the determination for an epidemic year--just the reported number of cases.It just pays to be careful and to use insect repellent with DEET.
"Good evening,Just to put things in perspective a tiny bit. I've lived in the tropics (jungles of New Guinea, Samoa, & various parts of the Caribbean) for the last 18 years & have never had Dengue & have known very few friends who've lived in tropical climates or visitors who have contracted it.Best,TerriePalmetto GH, Culebra"
If we are going to culebra on snorkel trip from main island do you think we need to be concerned? Should I change snorkel trip to different location? How can you wear bug repellent if you are snorkeling? Won't it wash off?
