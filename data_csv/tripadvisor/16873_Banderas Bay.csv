What is the water quality of Banderas Bay and is the ocean swimmable.
"Water quality is good. As in any area, where rivers run into the ocean/bay right after a heavy rain don't swim around the rivers where they drain into the ocean. The bay is calm for the most part unless there is a storm offshore that kicks up waves."
"01-Wanderer, as a fellow NJ resident I will comment, certain beaches on the Bay are better for swimming than others. When we used to stay at the old Camino Real, now the Hyatt Ziva, we would swim in the Bay every day. Now we stay at the Marriott in the marina area and I rarely swim there. I walk along it, but it is kind of pebbly on the bottom and can be very murky/sandy right by the water's edge. Plus, the Marriott has a wonderful infinity style pool!For comparison, I live in Point Pleasant NJ and swim in the ocean here all summer long. With all that being said, we love PV and will be returning for our umpteenth time there."
It pains me to say this but the beach at Sayulita should likely be avoided. Too many reported cases of illness. Thankfully this is an isolated case and does not apply to surrounding beaches.
"I swim in the bay, as do tons of people. The water is dark blue and not clear like the Caribbean, so it is similar to the ocean off the coast of California, if you've ever been there. Except for the aforementioned Sayulita, which is actually outside of the bay, water quality is good. Here is a thread from this year that includes test results around the bay. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15079â€¦Edited: 3 years ago "
Of course as the rainy season begins more and more pollutants will be flushed into the bay. A yearly occurrence.
We took a day trip to Sayulita and swam in the sea. No reported illnesses with myself or my partner.
"""We took a day trip to Sayulita and swam in the sea. No reported illnesses with myself or my partner.""The Sayulita Forums say otherwise. Have a look, you will see hundreds of reported cases. I'm a huge Sayulita fan but there's definitely an epidemic going on."
"I think you will find the beaches south of town much better for swimming. Water is clearer & calmer. Would suggest Mismaloya, or even taking a water taxi at Boca to some of the better beaches to the south."
"UCLA, one problem is the testing is done only 3 times per year and before crowds arrive for the major holidays like before Christmas, before Easter and before the summer school vacation time and the rainy season begins...Another problem is unlike most countries in the world Mexico says it is ok to swim in waters with and ecolli count of under 200 PPM, while the EPA uses 35 PMM so when beaches like Mismaloya or Quimixto have numbers of 138 PPM at this same time on last years report Mexico proclaims it is ok to swim but the EPA says it is 4x over the 35 PMM limit..."
eeeewwwwwhat?!
To suggest there is an epidemic is slightly over the top.
"""To suggest there is an epidemic is slightly over the top.""Tell that to the hundred of people who have gotten sick and reported back on the Sayulita forum. The first page of the forum usually has a half dozen threads or more discussing the issue. You haven't been over there to see the comments or you wouldn't have the same attitude.I'm one of Sayulita's biggest fans but to continue to deny there is a big problem is just wrong. Saying that you spent a day there and didn't get sick doesn't prove anything. I've never been sick there either but hundreds or more have."
"Yes I have read the Sayulita forums thank you. What you're forgetting is the thousands of visitors who haven't had an issue and don't report it anywhere. Where is it I've denied anyone is getting sick too?Also, you might want to check the definition of epidemic, I certainly wouldn't call it that."
"Sunmagic, Do you know what the levels of ecolli are allowed in England ? How many Parts Per Million of bacteria allowed?In the eight beaches on the Mexican testing results site 7 have an average count of 11 PPM whereas Sayulitas count is 130 PPM......Nobody complaining about the beaches of San Pancho or Punta de Mita which are on either side of Sayulitas beach...Another point is we do not know how many National vacationeers got sick after leaving from a day trip to Sayulita and illnesses were never reported..."
"Carico, I'm not denying anyone is getting sick - would you or whitejm care to point out where I am saying so? I reported that I'd visited, swam in the sea and didn't get sick, just like thousands of others too. Whatever it is, it certainly isn't an epidemic if you'd care to read up the definition of epidemic."
"I never stated it was an epidemic but you must admit when a 90 guest wedding party staying at different places,eating at different places and 80 get this same illness it is very strange...Please find out the numbers for England 's beaches, please...and I will look up epidemic...and I am glad you did not get sick,some of us have high immunity systems, I haven't had a cold since 1992........suerte"
