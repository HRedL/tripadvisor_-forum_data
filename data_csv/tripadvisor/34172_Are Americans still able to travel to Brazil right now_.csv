I was wondering if it is possible to travel to Brazil right now? My wife and child are there and I would like to get back to them as I'm not sure how long this will last and my wife just recently got into a car accident so she is physically recovering right now. I have already went to my doctor to ensure that I am COVID free. Are they not accepting Americans right now? I see that there are flights from Miami to Sao Paulo.
"Only people who fall under the following categories are allowed to enter Brazil thru the end of April:""BRAZIL - published 01.04.2020Passengers are not allowed to enter Brazil until 30 April 2020. This does not apply to:- Nationals of Brazil;- Passengers who reside in Brazil;- Foreign professionals in a mission in the service of an international body, if it is duly identified;- Foreign employee accredited to the Brazilian Government;- Immediate family member of a national of Brazil;- Passengers with an authorization issued by Brazilian Government;- Passengers with a National Migration Registry;- Technical landing to refuel where passengers of restricted nationalities are not disembarking;- Passenger in international transit if they do not leave the international area of the airport and the country of destination admits their entry.""You can follow changes in rules by looking at IATA (intl airline association) link below (it is updated about daily, as rules change all the time):https:/…1580226297.htmYou can see original decree (in Portuguese) here and figure out if you are amongst the allowed exceptions:in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/portaria-n-152-de-27-…[my read is that if you are married to or the father of a Brazilian national, you are allowed into the country under Article 4, item V.a; check with airlines how you would have to prove that at airport check-in to be allowed to board aircraft]flights: yes, there are some Latam flights, but not daily... also United from Houston... see comments #57 and #37 (and double check info with airlines):https:/…106272677"
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it!
"Traveling to Brazil now as an American is risky. You could easily be refused entry when you arrive. The borders are closed to all foreigners unless you are a permanent resident of Brazil with proper ID (RNE card). You might get lucky if your wife or child is Brazilian. If all three of you are Americans, it's unlikely you'll get in. Also, if you do get in, there are additional problems traveling inside the country. I'm not sure where your wife/child are, but most domestic flights have been canceled as well as some bus service in some states if you are crossing state lines. If you have an international driver's license, you might be able to rent a car."
"It isn't worth it I am just gonna wait till the end of the month as I don't have an RNE card or anything just a marriage certificate and in these uncertain times I don't want to go all the way out there and then they reject me.Edited: 6:41 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"Don't you qualify as an immediate family member of a Brazilian? See post 1. However, come with mask, gloves and just get to your destination the quickest way possible. BUM"
I don't have anything other than a US marriage certificate. We never registered our marriage in Brazil. So I'm not sure if they'd accept a US marriage certificate.
"@Midnightthat is why you should contact airline to see what kind of docs they are requiring at airports to allow boarding a flight to Brazil - before purchasing a tkt... (you can also double check with the nearest Brazilian consulate)…itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/brazilian_consulates…airlines have to check docs still at departure airport (in the USA in your case) as, even in normal times, they are fined by Brazil authorities if they allow anyone on the plane who is not eligible for entry... and they bear the cost of sending asap the person back to point of origin too... so, airlines are not really keen on letting ineligible passengers on aircraft.in any case, this may become a moot discussion,,, Latam has just announced it is suspending all its intl service too between April 13 and end of month, so flight options keep dwindling fast. see post #60 here:https:/…106324749in theory, after Latam does that, only remaining option would be United from Houston to Sao Paulo (if that does not change too; it is operating daily at the moment)... as mentioned by other poster, domestic flights also curtailed by more than 90%... as you do not mention where in Brazil you would need to be, we cannot help with domestic flight info (if needed)... there is a skeleton domestic flight network in place, but not necessarily with daily flights between places.Edited: 2:36 pm, April 10, 2020 "
I would be flying to Sao Paulo but my final destination is in Hortolândia.
"As far as anyone is aware, has Brazil extended this 30 suspension of non residents or citizens? It's supposed to end six days from now."
"Midnight I'm following the news at Folha, O Globo and Jornal do Brasil, but found nothing on the subject yet."
Any update?
"no.the original decree was signed by the Minister of Justice, who resigned Friday.a replacement has not been named yet; so it may be a few days until whoever takes the helm gets to that subject."
"Rokatoo, do you foresee Brazil opening its borders to foreigners in the near future? Ours in Argentina seem to be closed until September 1st."
"Hello Jorge,Domestic flights are still allowed in Brazil with an extremely reduced network: LATAM has a fleet with 160 aircrafts, 130 of which are grounded, justo to give you an idea!GOL announces it shall resume flights only as of late July, and in no way with the same capillarity as before corona, which means a number of frequencies shall be reduced and some destinations removed!As long as EU prevents foreigners from entering it, just like the US but for different reasons/purposes, it seems very unlikely our boarders are open before September, in my reading!And that assuming the death toll soars so quickly, that it leads to people's realisation of the might of the virus and forces them to adhere to isolation completely, unlike what our President ignorantly claims and unwisely preaches.The horizon is far and blurry, we can only know more or better as of early June and all depending on a number of factors, some of which external but most of them directly connected to individual and governamental decision(s).Vítor"
"the new Minister of Justice has extended for another 30 days ban on entry of all non-residents (and some specific exceptions) thru airports,see post #349 here:https:/…106482509[the new decree is a mirror copy of the original one, so you could still qualify for entry as someone married to a Brazilian citizen, as explained in previous posts.... consider the possible impact on number of flights.... and also the possibility that the U.S. itself may impose some restrictions/quarantine etc for people returning from Brazil, something that Trump mentions once in a while - but has not been implemented to date AFAIK]Edited: 5:18 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Yes, you can travel to Brazil, but you must be a resident or have other family ties! Not as tourists ..."
"With the unstable political picture in Brazil, you don't know what prevails: Impulse or reason! Personally I think, Argentina's measure was too harsh and will not be copied by other South American countries, but ..."
Brazil bans foreigners from entering the country by plane for another 30 days:https://bit.ly/3eWhuZX
"SouthAmDotTravel,Indeed I think our government in Argentina is taking quite drastic measures. I don't know how tourism and airline industry can reorganize their business model not knowing when and who can travel.The only good news I see from all these is that Argentina effectively slowed down the spread of the virus (which will happen anyway at a later stage) and the health system is sort of better prepared to cope with it.But as far as the economy goes, it's been a death sentence (not that our economy was in a much better shape, to begin with....)"
How do you prove the family ties? Is there anywhere that shows what I am supposed to bring to prove the family ties?
"So just to let everyone know I called United Airlines and they told me as long as I tell immigration the address I'm going to, as well as inform them that I am visiting a close family member, they will allow me to enter the country. I'll keep you all updated."
I would at least bring the marriage certificate... and something showing that the person you are married to is a Brazil national (passport copy maybe?)...info from airline personnel thru phone is notoriously unreliable.... they do not work at airports; they are not the ones who enforce the rules (it will be check-in or gate agents at airport of origin... and then Brazil immigration officials upon landing)... and often they have no clue what they are talking about... sometimes you call airline at diff times and two different representatives give opposite answers... try that...
"I second Rokatoo's excellent advice, please do bring with you copies of all important documents to prove and support the reason for your travel. You never know what kind of agent you have to deal with at every instance. Cheers!"
"Rakatoo I called back and as you stated got a totally different answer. At first they said I was good to travel. Then, after I pressed them they said they found out I must be a Brazilian resident or citizen. I think asked them about the clause on the Justice site about immediate family members and they said they didn't know anything about that and to call the embassy. Of course, the embassy is operating in emergency mode to help people stranded so they of course aren't gonna help. I'm just gonna head out there and get the answer for myself. Seeing my child is worth the attempt if they turn me away then I'll have an actual answer to tell you guys on what the requirements are to prove that you are immediate family. Thanks so much for your help I'll keep you informed."
"Thanks MidnightRonin, hopefully you can make it and be reunited with your child!"
"Yeah, so for all of you concerned a birth certificate with your name on it or a marriage certificate with your name on it will suffice. They will even take a picture of it on your phone just as long as it is clear and legible."
"Well that's great news on your end! Safe travels then, and will hope to hear back from you here to see how everything went. Cheers and stay safe!"
U.S. advises citizens still in Brazil to return home:https://bit.ly/2SGcq22
How did it end up going MidnightRonin? I am in a similar situation was curious to here how your experience was?
"Hi,I would recommend that you should also check with your closest Brazilian consulate for accurate and up-to-date info, documentation and rights.I hope that helps and best of luck to you and your family.Cheers,LD"
United flew there. It was a simple trip out of Houston. Right as you board you need to present the marriage certificate. Once you get to Brazil they can look up your marriage certificate in the system and verify you. At the time of boarding they'll accept a picture of the marriage certificate with your name on it. It is fairly easy from there.
"Glad to hear it all worked out! Curious, did they make you apostille your marriage certificate or was a U.S. marriage certificate good enough?"
"No they didn't scrutinize it too much. They were understanding but did ask for her CPF number, the child's, etc."
I am in the same situation
"I just traveled to Brazil. They had be bring my U.S. marriage license, (appostilled) and a Portuguese translation and it went pretty smoothly."
"Chris W,Glad you were able to make it with no hassle. Are you in Brazil at the moment? How is the situation according to your personal view? We read so many different things every day. Thanks in advance!Edited: 6:52 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"Yes I'm in Brazil right now. I'm currently in Uberlandia and it doesn't seem to be that different. There are just many covid safety precautions (face masks, sanitize, separated tables, etc)."
"Chris W, thanks again for the update! Stay healthy and safe, cheers!"

"I will be traveling to Brazil in August with my wife and child who are Brazilian. We have both U.S. and Brazilian marriage certificates, not to mention my son's American and Brazilian birth certificates. (He was born in the U.S.) I don't think we will need to have any of the American paperwork notarized. The Brazilian certificates are obviously in Portuguese and were registered with the consulate in Miami. So we wont bother wasting our time with the airline people on the phone. Just get the CoVid test results and notes from our doctors, and head to the airport with all of these documents."
"Good, but surely you must appreciate the absurdity of all of this. You go to the doctor, take a Covid test, get a negative result and nice certificate and letter, pack your bags, go to the airport and contract Covid from the Uber driver or anyone or anything else you encounter, which completely discounts the result of the test. Welcome to a world of insanity and hysteria where you are obliged to jump through hoops for absolutely no good reason."
"Brian,Is a quarantine mandatory for anyone arriving in Brazil at the moment? Or do you need to have a negative COVID19 proof? Thanks in advance!"
"Jorge, there is no quarantine or previous test requirement for those entering Brazil at the moment.what is limited (at the moment, until late July; it may or may not be extended) is WHO can enter Brazil.there has been no change in categories of those who can enter Brazil atm as discussed comprehensively in previous posts. (see#43 and #45).we should know in a few more days if the ban on entry will be renewed, or simply allowed to expire, or if there will be additional exceptions... anything else at this point is pure speculation or personal opinion, without any legal status."
"Rokatoo, thanks for the info!"
"press is reporting that Brazil will re-open most of its airports to all intl tourists, regardless of nationality or point of origin.however, land and water borders remain closed for another 30 days.one new requirement: all visitors will have to show proof of travel health insurance for duration of stay in Brazil[once the official decree is published, we will post link to it][this new measure replaces the expiring decree which severely limited entry of non-Brazil nationals or residents]"
"the official decree has been published... it basically confirms everything mentioned in #55the new articles allowing entry of tourists thru most airports (rough google translation):""Article 6... Restrictions referred to in this Ordinance do NOT prevent the entry of foreigners in the country by air, provided that the migratory requirements appropriate to their condition are obeyed, including that of having an entry visa, when required by the Brazilian legal system.Paragraph 1: Foreign passengers on a visit to the country for a short stay, of up to 90 days, must present to the transport company, before boarding, proof of purchase of health insurance valid in Brazil and with coverage for the entire period of travel, under penalty of being prevented from entering national territory by the migratory authority at the discretion of the health authority.Paragraph 2. International flights that have as their point of arrival in Brazil airports located in the following states are temporarily prohibited during the period of the present ordinance:Mato Grosso do Sul; Paraíba; Rondônia; Rio Grande do Sul; and Tocantins.Paragraph 3.

How do u get the health insurance and do u still have to bring documents for covid?
"Rokatoo, your post made me so happy! I've been scouring the web looking for an update. I thought there might be a chance of expiration since we were so close to the deadline without an announcement.Very good questions Bryan. I'm also interested in knowing."
"There are plenty of websites that offer travel health insurance for fairly inexpensive. I am looking at getting health insurance through Seven Corners, hopefully that is good enough for Brazil as it says it covers medical expenses in that country."
"the new decree does NOT make any mention to covid19 documents.it only makes reference to ""proof of purchase of health insurance valid in Brazil and with coverage for the entire period of travel"".note that travel insurance must also be shown to airline BEFORE boarding plane to Brazil; so it seems you have to convince airline check-in personnel that you have adequate coverage.the reason I mention it, for example, is for UK travelers - where it is often mentioned in many travel sites that insurance coverage is often voided if the destination country is in the FCO list of ""advice against travel"", which Brazil is at the moment.... UK travelers should check with their providers (good idea for travelers from other countries to find out if they have similar rules) if their coverage is indeed valid in Brazil now.UK FCO advisory for Brazil:https:/…brazilof course, we will only have a better idea of how this new requirement is enforced both by airlines and Brazil immigration once we get reports of actual traveler experiencesfinally, everyone should be aware that rules can change any time and with short notice, as we have seen in recent months.[as an anecdote: on the opposite direction, we have read reports about flights from Brazil to Portugal - where there are entry restrictions for non-residents etc.... report talks about one specific airline refusing boarding to about 20 passengers per flights - which indicates that airlines are indeed checking if travelers can meet entry requirements of their destination... usually airlines are fined by destination country if they allow someone on the plane who does not meet such requirements and it also has to bear the cost of flying person back.... we know that in ""regular times"" airlines in Brazil did deny boarding to people without visas and/or yellow fever intl certificate if either were required in destination country... it is the passenger's responsibility to make sure they have all necessary docs for travel; airlines will usually not refund tkts if passenger is denied boarding for tehse reasons]here is a better link to the latest decree - in larger font, so easier to print if one wants to do that:https://tinyurl.com/yxqjp2rdthe U.S. Embassy in Brazil has NOT updated yet its webpage for the new decree (it came out late yesterday), but it should do it in coming days....

"@ Richard #62the decree itself does not go into details about insurance coverage... sometimes, further clarification is provided by other agencies... most likely ANVISA - National Health Surveillance Agency. [the travel ban decrees (and the new one allowing entry by air in Brazil) are issued by some federal-level ministers. who may or may not have really thought thru how that actually is implemented at the ground level and just leave it to other agencies to sort it out and enforce it]this is what happened with previous decree (no longer in effect) that at that time required a ""medical declaration from a health authority or doctor that attests they do not have COVID-19"" for those who could travel under one of the then prevailing exceptions.the U.S. Embassy webpage had included clarification from ANVISA about that ""medical declaration"".... let's see if it does the same about health insurance when it gets to update it.It is all less than 24 hours old and we probably need to wait until more details come out from different federal-level entities - and they have their own timing to come out with decisions, rulings, clarifications etc.[honestly, I would not like to be an airline check-in or gate agent in charge of checking these ever changing restrictions from various countries and dealing with often confused, anxious or even irate passengers at the moment...]"
"Getting a health plan through a Brazilian provider like Amil, Assim, Golden Cross, etc. would be sufficient right? I'm going to check into their requirements for foreigners. I had an Amil plan previously but don't recall the details."
"btw, the U.S. Embassy in Brazil has updated its webpage about entry requirements for Brazil (but atm it does not add much to what has been discussed in previous comments):""Updated Brazil Travel Decree/Lifting of Air Entry RestrictionsEffective July 29, Brazil updated its decree to allow entry of foreign visitors traveling by air.
