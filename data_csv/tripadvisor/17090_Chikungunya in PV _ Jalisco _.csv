"Hello,I have read in the news last month that chikungunya cases are being reported in many states of Mexico including Jalisco. I planned on spending a few days in PV and then heading to Barra de Navidad.Any information on the situation currently in PV and Jalisco in general would be much appreciated.Thank you."
"It’s important to note that it is possible to get this infection in many places around the world. It is not a Mexico specific issue. The easiest way to prevent the infection is to prevent mosquito bites. The use of repellents with deet is best. If you are using sunscreen apply the tanning cream first and repellent after.Found this article from the Guadalajara Reporter from November 2015. According to the article only two cases have been reported in the state of Jalisco.The chikungunya virus has extended to ten Mexican states, and while only two cases have been reported in Jalisco, neighboring Colima has 34 confirmed cases. Nonetheless, health authorities here have taken the precaution of posting warning notices at the Guadalajara Airport, advising travelers of the symptoms of the illness.Like dengue fever, this arthropod-borne virus is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying Aedes mosquitoes. It produces an acute febrile phase lasting two to five days, followed by a longer period of joint pains in the extremities, sometimes lasting many months, or even years.The onset of the rainy season has caused a spike in the number of chikungunya cases nationally, federal health authorities report. Guerrero is the worst affected state, with 839 confirmed cases, followed by Oaxaca with 268 and Chiapas with 263.Edited: 4 years ago "

There us a large poster about it at the bus stop at Lans/Plaza Caracol. It basically tells the personal precautions to take including removing standing water at residences.
"Bring bug spray with deet and avoid areas that have free standing water.This is pretty high in Jamaica and the Dominican Repiblic, but cases are also in some warmer states of USA as well."
"We were all over Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara on buses over the past three weeks and that poster that kat mentions above was on dozens of bus stop shelters throughout both cities. Logic would say that there must be some cases locally for the notice to be that widespread, (Widespread notice, not widespread disease).Unfortunately, as usual, my bug repellent didn't stop the mosquitos or jejenes from getting me but I applied it regularly anyway, figuring maybe I deterred more than got me. As usual, just like last December, they seemed to get me under tables in restaurants. That's when I was extra careful to apply repellent.It's worth a stop while out walking or catching the bus, to read the poster (as well as a Google in English). The poster is easy to find. Has the disease title in the headline and several pictures, as well as the listed precautions."
"Bug repellent..always is best I can say. It is existant in Jalisco, and many other areas of the world...mosquito borne. I have had dengue...and frankly know it was a mistake when forgot my repellent. Wear repellent...if you are at a place where lots of standing water or mosquitos..leave."
"Oh no, hopefully everyone is okay. I hope it doesn't become an epidemic in PV like some places in carribean"
"Travlsboy --- This is a preventative, not an epidemic. The government wants to make sure people are aware of the possibility and protect themselves."
"Just prevention, not even close to anything like an epidemic...Awareness decreases ability for mosquitos to breed etc...so is preventive measure...as is repellant..."
