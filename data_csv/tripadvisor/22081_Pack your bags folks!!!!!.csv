"Well, that's one obstacle down (and expected).But UK FCO still have to lift travel advice currently in place - against all but essential international travel. And Greece have to decide to allow UK travellers in."
"I heard this am that the FCO.is likely to lift the ban.That still leaves the Greek government to let U.K. travellers in.Also if our Covid rates go up with recent silly behaviour e.g. packed beaches, Liverpool footie celebrations, demonstrating with little social distancing, illegal parties/raves then we will all end up disappointed.Hope we are ok to travel safely."
"Well Tui announced that they were travelling from 11th July to Crete,Corfu,Rhodes,Kos and also to Majorca,Ibiza,Lanzarote and Tenerife.Kefallonia isn't mentioned in this and neither is Skiathos,which is where I'm meant to be going in August.I'm confused with all of this."
"And there’s no guarantee that your flight is still operating, many are still being cancelled.Good luck though."
Hopefully things will be a lot clearer and more certain next week.We're due to travel in 11 weeks - the next worry will be the fact that so much could/will change in that period!
"It’s been 29th that any announcement will be made for the last 3weeks. Haris Theoharis(Tourism Minister) just virtually confirmed it(still left in the it will be in 3weeks from now, until uk govt confirm) we all know by now that they leak what is going to happen & then mophead takes the glory at press conference"
Fingers crossed all. I just wondering shall I hit the book flight button as kefalonia is t on the list yet ????
"Yes, flights are scheduled for all Greece inc Kef"
"Thanks lisa, we have our apartments booked, had Thomas cook flights go bust then BA flight cancelled this month blooming pants. What date are flying out ? We are look at Jet2 flight 29th thanks hun xx"
"Hi ilsleys, we are flying 3rd August from Leeds Bradford, can't wait !!!!! We were booked for June cancelled, were going 6th July again cancelled. Have a fab time, take care keep safe Lisa xEdited: 5:41 am, June 27, 2020 "
"The EU have been arguing for weeks about who they will allow to travel from 3rd countries. Greece has been trying to get them to commit to a plan with no luck as yet.From reading other forums around the net some TO's are not committing to fly to certain places due to lack of info and the redundancies of pilots and crew. Jet2 are not now flying to Kalamata, they were filling the space left by the demise of TC . TUI are not starting flights to Skiathos till August I think. Hold off booking until everything is certain and you won't be disappointed."
"Well its a start, but only if the Greeks let us in and you are only going to Crete, Rhodes and KOS with Tui .Not too sure about JET2, I might be doing the same?I have read that most of the Greek Islands have been cancelled for 2020 by Tui and Jet2."
"No I had only heard about TUI , but I thought by looking at the flights they had only cancelled out flying from Birmingham for kefalonia, I’ve not seen anything for jet2, really love to get back to that magical island and see all our friends again. Such uncertainty again!!! Just wish they would confirm now and update everything for everyone!!"
I have posted the Jet2 Kef flight schedule on here
"We’ve just booked for 2nd August staying in a villa with James Villas. We’re confident that the travel corridor will mean that Greece will let UK tourists in, the only thing I’m slightly worried about is if Easyjet cancel the flights if the demand is low. But as we’ve booked a package we’ll be entitled to a refund or will be able to move the dates."
Just double checked JET2 web site.They have no package holidays running to Kefelonia until 2021 [Corfu too for that matter].I would have thought that if the planes were in deed flying there they would package deals too?Very strange!
"That’s odd Phil I had looked earlier this morning and Jet2 had loads of packages to Kefalonia this year. Looked again since seeing your post and yes - plenty from July thru to end of Sept, that was from Man, didn’t check other airports though."
"Keep up the optimism folks as the Greek economy needs visitors spending freely. It's all very well Boris letting us back in without a 14 day quarantine but until the Greek Government let UK flights and passengers in, we ain't gonna get there! What the Greeks do NOT want is people coming in who may bring the virus with them; visitors from badly affected countries are likely to fall into that category; keep your fingers crossed and wait for the official announcement from the Greek Government.By the way, can anyone direct me to a definitive, authoritative site (not somebodies 'opinion', or 'I think' ) where a factual answer is regarding the safety of sitting on a plane with 150 other people for four hours?We have flights and accommodation booked for the end of August so I'm as keen as anyone to get a clear resolution to all the current palaver."
"Hi, yes just looked they are doing packages from M/c as fiscardofan says, Panorama, White Rocks, etc"
#19 - have a read of these:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52822913https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/science…
"Yes, Manchester.Looks like they have pulled most other airports [Birmingham was what i was looking at]"
"For me, the question isn't whether my flight/holiday will go ahead (or would have gone ahead if I hadn't proactively cancelled before the final balance was due).It's what resorts will look like.What's the situation with sunbeds round the pools? Will I be able to get into my favourite restaurant with half the tables removed?WillIi be able to get on the local buses?Will I be able to go on the trips I'd planned to do?And that's before I thought about the actual travel.Check-in, Security, flight, passport control, luggage reclaim, coach transfer - and the same in reverse.I really didn't want to spend £1.5k on the holiday and another similar sum on food and drink, and wish I'd stayed at home.I may be selfish but if my holiday wasn't the same as previous years because of the restrictions, I wouldn't enjoy it."
"You'll be tested on arrival in Greece & if you test positive, you'll have to spend 14 days in quarantine. Enjoy!"
Thisis..... reported a few days ago that Jet2 flights from Birmingham this season had been cancelled. Flights (and packages) from other airports - not just Man are still operational as shown https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
Beware if you fly to / from Scotland https:/…uk-scotland-53203877
"Jet2 have announced today a revised programme for summer 2020, for both flights and package holidays. They have stated they will not be operating this year to Jersey,Mykonos,Santorini,Kalamata,Halkidiki,Lesbos,Nice and Verona. Plus some other reductions taking place across their nine Uk bases.They don’t specify what these will be. Hopefully Kefalonia will be ok. Obviously depending on everything else that has to be taken in to consideration."
"Hi Debbie, Jet2 flight schedule, from 5 uk airports to Kef was announced earlier this week"
I agree with you on all of your concerns.
Hello Stanthegreek. I found a news article titled Is It Safe To Fly by Jean-Brice Dumont chief engineer at AirbusI am uncomfortable about seating stir being the same on the aircraft even withx4veryone wearing a face mask.
If it is a cheap flight and not too much to lose if you lose the money and your accommodation can be cancelled without losing money I would press the button
"Hi, how did you manage to book with James Villas? I went to book today for late August and I got a message saying there was maintenance on the site and they would call me back, villa says reserved for me for 24hrs but they aren't working weekends so I can't call them. Presumably they will call me Monday but they are prioritising customers with holidays already booked going in the next week or two for comms."
"Hi!The posts on Kefalonia Unplugged suggest that the TOs have consolidated their flights to handle the reduction in demand. They also seem to be ""sharing out"" the airports that they are flying from to reduce competition."
"Hi Col, since Haris Theoharis was on bbc breakfast this morning demand has rocketed even more than uk govt leak prior to Monday’s announcement"
"Hi Dave, we booked our holiday a couple of days ago and a similar thing happened to us, the villa booking went through but the flights didn’t. Reason was that the flight prices increased just as we were making the booking. A quick call to James Villas sorted it though, although we had to pay the slightly higher flight costs!"
"Hi, we have an EJ flight booked for 21st July but it seems EJ may only be flying to Kef from 24th. Does anyone know if it’s possible to find out if the 21/7 flight will definitely not happen? If we could determine that, we can make alternative arrangements. But options for flights a few days later are quickly running out so feels like we need to do something now."
"Hi Sheila, all passenger planes are fitted with a Hepa filter. Air is passed through filter 20-30 times a hr filtering any sort of dust , moisture, bacteria and any sort of contamination. They capture 99.9% of particles.More than likely to catch a virus/germs from hard surfaces. I will be taking antibacterial wipes and hand wash.l always do. These filters are used in operating theatres.Take care keep safe Lisa x"
Yes Lisaben thank you that is explained in the article that I mentioned but I still don't like the idea of rubbing elbow with a total stranger at the best of times
Getting out of bed in the morning is a risk!!!
To be honest I thought there would be some spacing on flights but there doesn't appear to be
"Hi Sheila, l don't think it would make any difference. I get what your saying we all like our own space. If you are travelling as a couple or in a group you could have a window seat. I always check out who l will be sitting next too lol, if l am not happy my Husband gets that seat.If you decide to go have a lovely time, do what you are comfortable with.Take care Lisa x"

"Hi, all the airlines revised schedules have been posted on Kefalonia Pulse, Express Rent a Car, Kefalonia Unplugged, Kefalonia by us."
The Astra Village in Svoranata is not opening this season. How sad ☹️
"The easiest & quickest way is to look on Express Rent a Car they are all there, the LGW was updated info posted on 21 June"
"Hi, I’ve been posting what’s open/opening"
"Just checked the news and found that Greece have extendEd the ban for uk until 15th July, can anyone confirm this?"
"Yeah, you’re right. BBC News just reported it."
"Hi, that was expected & isn’t an extension as that’s when the flight schedule begins, apart from O’Leary’s headline grabbing 2 flights before the negotiated flight start."
No travelling to Greece until July 15th
