"Hi,can anyone give me some info if there are any beach parties and or boat parties in sharm?staying at magic life so if there is anything close that would be great but dont mind payuing for a taxi if needs be .many thanks"
Boat parties you can't due to Muslim drink laws as all excursions on boats only offer soft drinks as for beach parties one of the hotels did offer this but was called off
well i have learnt something new i did wonder about booze on boats
"Don't think it's anything to do with Muslim drink laws, just common sense."
"The camel bar,in partnership with Emperor diving, used to do a booze cruise but stopped running it a couple of years ago due to lack of interest,another victim of the AI epidemic I guess."
"There is one beach party that we got asked about but wasn't interested in,I think it was coco beach or summert. One of the reps mentioned it, give it a search and see,this was only 2 weeks ago when we was there. Gaz"
"Cocco beach is class most animation reps will do a trip there once a week usually costing Â£20 which includes return transfers entrance and 1 drink. Every night the animation will have a club night trip whether it is pacha, space, hard rock. The other beach night club is pataya beach 2 mins from ur hotel. There's 1 night a week were it's really gd."
"For beach parties there is also Terrazina and Terrazina 2, both in Maya bay/ old market."
"thanks all for the replies, so boat party out and bring on the beach party :)"
