"That's right. That's the name the Monte Carlo folks came up with.Maybe the Fat A$$ Buffet came in as a second choice. It is the quality and variety of the food at a buffet that are important but, really, Big Belly Buffet? I wonder if the Monte Carlo folks could name the soon to be opened Caesars Palace buffet what would they come up with. Any ideas?"
American Epidemic Buffet?
Wheres the restroom buffet?

I laughed when I read the name a couple of weeks ago. At least there is some truth in advertising. (Heart Attack Grill and Big Belly Buffet) :-)
Big Bulimia Buffet
Emperor's Vomitorium
The Tremendous Terrific Trough
Do ya hafta have a big belly to eat there? Or is that just a result?
"Even if it suddenly became terrific, I think the name would deter me."
Gluttons R Us.
And after you finish you can waddle out to the Big Pockets Casino.
The Heart Attack Grill is so extreme it's funny. This is just disgusting.
"So, do people with big bellies get a discount?"
"When CET sent that e-mail a little while back asking opinions on a proposed buffet name (which I was assuming was for IP and not Caesars) it had a dumb name like ""Kitchen"". Other people I know said their survey had the name ""Eat"". I thought THOSE were stupid until Monte Carlo came up with this name. Geeze, I already have a big enough belly and I eat healthy! I wouldn't even walk into a place with that name. Not sure what they were thinking with that one. Wicked Spoon was an interesting name with the gimmick of individual portions. This just seems dumb. Maybe there's a Buddha in the hall who's stomach you rub on the way in and hope you are lucky enough to not get sick from the food?"
i'm curious why people would not go to a place because of the name
.... because there are a LOT of buffets to go to in Vegas. .... I wasn't planning on going to the one at Monte Carlo anyway and that name certainly won't entice me. ....I don't like buffets enough to go more than once per trip. ....just to let the hotel know their name choice did nothing to make the place sound appealing. ....they'd be afraid someone would take a photo of their fat self walking under the big belly sign and put it on the internet. (I could go on.)I'm sure people will still be eating there.
"I don't have a problem with it at all, and I think it's pretty amusing and I appreciate the truth in advertising. You know what buffet I wouldn't go to? The flat stomach buffet.Edited: 8 years ago "
thats for sure Doug
My vote goes to:The Pig Trough
"The Monte Carlo needs to fire their marketing department. A name is something that helps draw customers into your establishment. As someone said previously in this thread, I wasn't planning on going to the Monte Carlo and the Big Belly Buffet does nothing to convience me that the Monte Carlo is a place I want to visit. Serriously if you are going for a south of France type theme (i.e. Monte Carlo) how hard is it to come up with an appealing french-sounding name. Such as the Cote d'Azur Buffet. Somebody really needs to be fired."
"If you consider that the Monte Carlo tends to market itself as a mid-level property, it sort of makes sense. The name will probably appeal to the same crowd of people who like family-friendly comedy (think Jeff Foxworthy, etc), and while I believe the price went up a bit, it's still priced reasonably for a Strip buffet.I know that it's stupid to choose a restaurant based on its name, but humans do stupid things even when we're aware of it. Given the number of options in Vegas for buffets, I would not choose the ""Big Belly Buffet""."
What are the buffet at Bellagio and Wynn called. arent they just called The Buffet wow that impressive
"Yes, I think I'd be a little embarrassed to be heading to ""Big Belly Buffet."" But then, I don't do that many buffets. All you can eat is wasted on me. Small portions of good food spread out over several enjoyable sit down meals is my idea of dining."
my god you would be embarrassed to go to a place becasue of its name. You really care what stuck up snobs think of you? Thats sad. maybe you are one of them
This is a great name. It is saying that the food is so good that you will have a full big belly of good food when you leave.
"Yes, indeed, I could be embarrassed to eat at some place because of its name. No I don't think I'm a snob. I wouldn't judge others who eat there. I'd just rather not associate a meal with a ""big belly."""
"I was saddened to hear the news of ""Big Belly Buffet"". Monte Carlo (4 Star) is truly the more refined brother of New York New York (3 star). It has a great location with good connection to upscale neighbors almost transitioning from NYNY to Aria and finally Bellagio. Indeed, after the fire, they remade the top floor into the boutique Hotel 32, by no means a mid-level move.It is mind boggling that they would change the name of the Buffet from ""The Buffet"" to ""Big Belly Buffet"". Such a downgrade, while worthy of a lower end property, it is not in keeping with Monte Carlo's history. Somebody had to be on Crack to think up something so insulting to Monte Carlo Patrons. Shame on them."
its a name people lighten up. this is funny that people think this hard about a name. i only care if they have good food.
"It's a middle of the road property with a buffet that screams a middle of the road name. Marketing is just marketing. Some marketing major came up with the name and thought it was a good idea. Like sheep, they all agreed. Agree with Kintca.: Come on in and start emptying your pockets. Big bellies don't have any room left to store there money. Also a psychological game. When your full and stuffed. You actually don't want to move around. Hence, empty your wallet.They will try anything and say anything to get you in the door. It's getting you to come back is the question. On with the next."
"If I owned a buffet, I would call it fat and happy or full, fat, and happy. Maybe Monte Carlo should hire me for their marketing team. Beth"
i like the names snizbiz
