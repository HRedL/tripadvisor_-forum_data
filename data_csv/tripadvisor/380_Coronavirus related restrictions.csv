"Anyone has any details on Coronavirus related restrictions in Tahiti? I read flights from certain countries, visitors need to show a certificate less than 15 days old that they have no viral infection. Which countries are part of this restriction? I am arriving from US but visited Taiwan recently and wondering if I need to show this certificate."
Have you received any further information to your question? I just posted a new question regarding this as I noted further advisories from the French Polynesian government.
"There’s information on this herehttps:/…I’m a bit confused what this means. I’m going to be travelling from Australia to Papeete in April (via Nee Zealand which is the only practical route). I’m not clear if this means I have to have a certificate - the Australian Government Smart Traveller website says you only need this if travelling from Asia via Japan/New Zealand, whereas this could be read as meaning anyone going via NZ needs this."
"We flew in from the US this past Monday. They didn’t require any additional information for us. They did make an announcement right before landing in Papeete about people checking our temps once we land due to the coronavirus, but they never checked it when we landed."
I am flying from SFO to Bora Bora on Tuesday. I have a mom who just came from South Korea. Did you have any problems entering or leaving Bora Bora from SFO?
"the air tahiti nui site has a big warning advising that any tourists entering the country who have been in restricted countries anytime since 1 january 2020 are required to show a medical certificate less than 5 days old before they can enter the country. the restricted country list includes, but is not only, singapore, japan, china, italy"
Do you know if they checked for it or see anyone being turned back from entry? I ask bc I checked 15 diff hospitals and none of them are willing to provide such “medical certificate.”
South Korea is now on the list as well.
"Hello,Does anyone actually have a good understanding of the guidelines? I am due to travel from the US on 3/13 to New Zealand for 5 days and then heading to Bora Bora on 3/18. Does everyone laying-over or transiting via New Zealand required to have a health certificate? Also what is a health certificate? Is it a note from a physician stating that I do not have viral symptoms? I'm sure it will be impossible to show negative corona. This is all very confusing and I'm seriously considering cancelling/delaying my trip to paradise. Thanks in advance to folks who might know."

I think the problem is if you’re just transiting through one of the listed countries you won’t have the opportunity to got the doctors to get this note.
"Hi all,I am in Bora Bora now (arrived in Papeete on the Tuesday on a flight from Auckland). I started in the UK and travelled to LA and then to Auckland. I travelled to LA as I was originally supposed to travel to Singapore. Since I learned that Singapore was a country on the list requiring passengers to produce a medical certificate, and that it was almost impossible for me to do so in the travel timescales that I had, I re-routed my flight to LA so that I did not need to produce the medical certificate. During the flight, the airline gave the usual immigration forms plus another form around declaring information related to Coronavirus. On this, you answer whether you have been in China in the last 14 days (yes/no). You list all the countries you have been to in the last 30 days (for me it was U.K., USA and NZ). On arrival this form is given to the ground staff at Faa’a international and your temperature is taken. If all is fine, you go straight to passport control and then to baggage collection. At no point was I required to produce a medical certificate. I would advise to keep an eye on the travel restrictions for Tahiti as it is a situation that can change quickly."
"Dear acha114,Thanks so much for your information. That really clarifies are lot for me. So coming from the US and laying over in NZ will not need anything special. Worse case, I can I can try to visit a urgent care clinic to get a doctor's note. I'm feeling better about the trip as long as there are no cases of the virus in Tathiti and NZ."
Thank you. That's really useful. I don't know why I am panicking. I don't go until July and flying from UK to LA then to Tahiti x

It states you need one in the last 5 days before you travel
"This is the latest I have seen from the Tahiti Tourism sitehttps:/…Edited: 8:29 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Everyone,The medical certificate is only for those who have visited at-risk zones that are advertised on the Tahiti Tourism website. If you don’t visit these areas and you are coming from a region that isn’t listed on their website at the time you do not need to go through the hassle of getting a medical certificate. If your itinerary contains stopovers in at-risk zones before getting to Bora Bora then you need to assess whether getting this medical certificate signed 5 days before your trip is realistic. I had to bite the bullet and rearrange my flight at additional expense to avoid Singapore."
"Hi Everyone. We are two Americans currently traveling in Japan prior to leaving from Tokyo-Narita to Papeete, FP next Saturday 7 March. Has anyone arrived j in n Tokyo from one of the listed countries which requires a doctor’s note? We plan to see a doctor in Kyoto this week to get our notes and are wondering if anyone can share their experience since these new rules have been established for the Coronavirus outbreak? Thank you!Edited: 5:33 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"How do the authorities know if the ""doctor notes"" are real or faked? Anyone can create one. it is just a piece of paper, doesn't mean a thing."
"It’s not really helpful to call that into question, but thanks for sharing your opinion. It would be helpful to hear from anyone who has traveled to Tahiti in the past month since the rules were put in place, however. Here is what we received from the concierge at our hotel:Regarding your question, the certificate from doctor have to be general one saying that you are in good health and you are not suffering form no one kind of flu virus. The documents is accepted in any language, preferable to have double translation in English."
"Flew in 5 days ago from Oslo via Doha, Auckland. I was asked before boarding in Oslo if I have traveled in the last 14 days to China. Nobody asked me to show anything. In Auckland, before checking in, I was asked if I have traveled in the last 15 days to one of the whole list of the countries FP’s government is asking for. Because I have been to Sri Lanka I declared it, the check in was denied before presenting this medical certificate. They came with the solution either, by telling me how can I get this certificate. I went to some medical office, close to the airport, 5 min by taxi or Uber, and after a very short consult a doctor relieved me this certificate. This certificate is just a short note:‘Mr..... was seen and examined by me on 25 Feb 2020 and he has no symptoms or sign of viral infection currently.’ That’s all. Everything cost me 135 NZD pp including transport. This certificate was perfectly acceptable for Air New Zealand staff at check in. In Papeete nobody asked me to present it. The medical cabinet name from AKL is ‘Airport Doctors’. I hope that helps."
"Thanks so much, Adrian. Super helpful!"
Really helpful Adrian! Thank you x
"My mom came from Korea so we had to show a doctors note - vitals, temperature, flu etc. it cost me about $200 at CVS minute clinic in the US. They do check when you board in the US and when you land in Tahiti."
"Why would TripAdvior delete this post? It is SO important and relevantEdited: 5:25 pm, March 01, 2020 "
You should be fine unless it gets worse by July
"I came w someone who landed from Korea. Yes you need a doctors note - temperature, vital signs etc. they def check but they didn’t really read it. There is absolutely no guidance on what a “medical certificate” should contain- so we did the flu test, physical, blood pressure, temperature, everything."
No one knows if it is fake or real. It’s an honor system
"Thanks so much, Sofia!"
"We are scheduled to visit Bora Bora in Mid-April from SFO. We have direct flight from SFO to PPT and back so no at-risk countries involved. At this point, I am very confused about what to do. We may still be able to cancel hotels for no charge. I am not sure however if we will get refunded for flights if we cancel them so that would be a big loss. I feel that, unless Bora Bora or US totally ban flights, I should still keep my travel plans. How is the situation in Bora Bora/Moorea? Any impact from coronavirus?"
"Hi Seattlehawk,I would 100% go ahead with the vacation if I were you. There are no cases of the virus in FP at the moment. You are far more likely to catch it at home in the USA then in FP. And thankfully, for many people (who are young and fit) it would be just like having the flu , if that.Good luck.Yesh"
Does anyone know where you could get a medical certificate in the USA (For tourists) if the situation changes and French Polynesia requires it? Many thanks Yesh
"Thanks Yesh! Indeed, there are more cases of coronavirus in Seattle than all of FP!Edited: 6:15 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Yesh, your question was answered a few replies up in the thread. CVS Minuteclinic (pharmacy chain walk-in clinic) was given as an option someone used in the US."
"Very good point, a doctor's note is not a test."
Looks like the health certificate requirement is now required for all travelers regardless of nationality or travel history and also applies to crew. My guess is most airlines will now start cancelling flights.
I don’t think this is the case yet. The Tahiti tourism page is still listing the same risk zones as the my had done at the end of Feb.
"The gov’t website is updated to reflect the changes. Just a little cumbersome to navigate. There’s a translate to English option at the bottom of the page. Also seems like if you are coming from an area with community spread (most places now), you will need to be quarantined for 14 days. Makes Tavel to Tahiti pretty much impossible:https:/…Edited: 2:19 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Thank you Yonki, for finding and posting that updated Link. Wow."
"Hi, I think it is saying you need a medical certificate (5 days) if you're a tourist but if you are returning to FP you will be monitored for 14 days. As of March 2 2020, every person (including flight personnel) must present for a flight to French Polynesia, a medical certificate certifying the state of health free of any sign of infection at coronavirus. Please see below. 'You are returning from an area where the virus is circulating with transmission between people. For 14 days after your return, we will check that you have not been infected.'"
"It is not clear to me if ""returning from"" is related to FP citizens or to everyone ""arriving"" in FP.Edited: 5:24 am, March 03, 2020 "
"I am also not sure and are travelling to FP next week! I am so nervous now. Also, just found out that medical certificate will cxost me £130/pp and I am not happy at all..."
"Hi Anna,Where have you found that has agreed to provide with you the medical certificate? I'm struggling to find anyone in London who will do this. Im not travelling until the end of July but want to have a place in mind that will provide this if need be when the time comes. I think £130 is a lot but when you're looking at the bigger picture, it is money well spent as the alternative is not going at all. Hope it all goes well for you xx"
"So the big unknown to start is what is meant by ""Medical Certificate"" If it is a quick look over by a physician, vital signs, etc., that is one thing. Lab testing is another thing and takes much longer. We are US citizens scheduled to fly from Melbourne March 30 via Auckland. We would have to get a medical certificate in Adelaide. Any solid info on what the French Polynesian government considers a medical certificate will be greatly appreciated.."
Look at post 23. Somebody already answered your question. I am flying next week too.
"Thanks. Read that, but that was before this latest set of restrictions issued on March 2, so wondering if any change of anything more specific on ""Medical Certificate"". What I am struggling with is that an exam essentially proves nothing. You can carry the virus without symptoms. But whatever, I just want to know we can get into Tahiti on March 30 after getting a certificate via quick medical exam in Australia."
I also think it just doesn't make any sense but don't think anyone will take a blood test sample and do actual coronavirus test. I believe it takes about 3 days to receive a result. It will be very expensive too. They literally just want to know if you have any symptoms of viral infection. It is impossible to provide more. Imagine they introduced this new restictions yeaterday and somebody fly today. How could they obtain it?
Its official. Everyone is required to bring a Health Certificate. https://www.service-public.pf/dsp/covid-19/
"We contacted the Tahiti Ministry of Health and they verified that this medical certificate is a doctor's note stating that you do not have any symptoms of the flu. Also, no one can just walk into a hospital to get testing for the actual coronavirus unless you're showing signs of the flu. They wouldn't waste their resources for people who aren't symptomatic. Don't worry, the doctor's note will be good enough. If you're still concerned, you should just reach out to the Ministry of Health directly as we did and they will respond."
"What about the second part of the statement:""You are returning from an area where the virus is circulating with transmission between people. For 14 days after your return, we will check that you have not been infected.""I don't understand what does this ""check"" entail.Edited: 1:21 pm, March 03, 2020 "
I'm flying Saturday LAX to PPT via Air France. Will report back my experience. Crossing my fingers I dont develop a cold from now until departure. So stressful!!
That would be great. Thank you.I am flying next Thursday and I am also really nervous.
"I am also flying on Thursday, the 12th from LAX, and am wondering what kind of note is required. Just a simple note from a physician stating you have no symptoms?"
Please keep posted. I am flying on sat 3/7 from San Francisco.
I just received an email from my travel agent. I’m leaving LA to Tahiti on 3/20th and was told the Tahiti government has implemented a new law. Anyone from anywhere will need a doctors note that they are in good health and do not show signs of a virus. It must be signed by your doctor. They will not let you board a plane to Tahiti without the document. The note must be dated within 5 days of your travel date
"Yes, doctor's note stating you don't have flu symptoms within 5 days of travel."
Our flight leaves LAX actually on March 13th at 12:30am on Air France. Fingers crossed!!!!
"Wow. Really? I don't have a doctor, haven't traveled since October 2019, and am in perfect health... but I still have to have a doctor's note that says I'm in good health?! That's going to be an enormous and expensive problem to try to find a new-to-me doctor and get an appointment within five days of my flying in April."
Do you have any walk-in clinics in your city? Start calling around to see if you can get an appointment. Here's a recent article where a couple couldn't board the flight because they did not have a doctor's note:https:/…
Our travel agent gave us word that we have to have a doctor's letter of clearance not older than 5 days and proof on our passport we have not been to China or they will not let you board Air Tahiti Nui. We leave Friday so the scramble to get the doctor note has been real fun!!
"Do you have health insurance? I have Aetna and I can go to the CVS minute clinic and get a travel clearance for free, if not should not be too high of a fee."
"I would be really great if people who are flying over the next couple of months could post their experience with these new regulations in place. I , for one, would be really grateful to see what type of medical certificates people are being provided with so I can show my GP as they say in instances like this the Tahitian government should provide a document that would then be stamped and signed by the doctor. Thanks in advance"
"We are US citizens in Japan prior to going to Tahiti and went to a doctor’s clinic in Kyoto today and had a quick assessment for fever and flu. The doctor filled out a medical certificate form he had already pre-made and then signed, dated and stamped it. The form also included the clinic’s contact details. It cost 1000¥/less than $10 USD. Will post again on arrival to Tahiti Saturday."
"Great....more to worry about. I depart LA, after two days visiting the city, on April 19th. With an unexpected, last minute trial just scheduled that I have to attend for my job two days after I'm back, now I have to worry about the virus and even getting to Bora Bora. I planned, saved and dreamed of this trip for years and years and really can't even enjoy the preparation and anticipation. I KNOW, I KNOW - first world problems! lol I also think about the fact of having to sit in a doctor's office or clinic exposed to people who are actually sick, maybe even with the flu, while being totally healthy. I don't have a regular physician. Whenever I go to one of the walk-in clinics I usually get seen by a NP or PA. I'm not sure that's also a French or FP thing. Do you think something signed by one of them would suffice instead of an actual MD?"
"Oh, I forgot to add to my post - I read on some travel agency website last night that the medical certificate had to state you have no symptoms of Covid-19 specifically. I don't know if that's true. If so, Americans can't be tested specifically for Covid-19 unless they fall under some strict criteria. Has anybody else heard that?"
I would ask the practitioner to simply state that as of “x” date you do not have any signs or symptoms of the flu or COVID-19.
The Minister of Health and Prevention for French Polynesia has a travel information update posted at tahititourisme.comAll passengers including flight attendants and pilots must present a health certificate dating less than five days and certifying the traveler’s state of health is free of any signs of the coronavirus infection when boarding flights to French Polynesia
"I understand that. The problem for many Americans traveling at least in the next month or two, is that we can't just ask for a test for Covid-19/Coronavirus. The tests are only available right now for sick people who also meet other criteria (i.e. where they've traveled, exposure, etc.)."
Has anyone successfully obtained the required health certificate? It seems most urgent care and walk-in clinics do not offer them.
Local health emergency declared in L.A. County. Well this is just fantastic news.... Im sure most of us are traveling through LA. Ugh
"I think there is a distinction between “free of any signs” or symptoms and an actual test. I don’t believe the FP policy statement mandates a test, per se, just a signed statement saying you are asymptomatic."
Here in Toronto our walk-in clinics are able to provide a doctor's note. I just spoke to a doctor today (went in for other reasons) and the doctor said there's no problem obtaining one. We just need to inform them in advance and they will have the document ready for when we go in to get assessed. Your best bet is to call around and see if they're able to assess you to make sure you're in good health and write a note stating you have no symptoms of the virus.
"They're not requiring you to get tested for the exact virus because obviously you can't if you're not sick. It's literally just a doctor's note that you don't have symptoms of the flu (fever, headache, body ache, etc). I already wrote in this forum that we contacted the Tahiti Ministry of Health and they confirmed that the doctor's note is sufficient. Please reach out to them directly to get the latest information if you're still unsure and need more clarification."
"Just got home from my Dr. with a simple note saying I'm free of any flu like symptoms, dated for today, flying to bora bora on Sat, I will report back when I get there and let yall know how it goes."
Thank you for keeping us updated!! Can you show us or tell us what your doctor wrote? I leave (hopefully) on Thursday!!
Yep be there Friday
"I had just called the intercontinental Tahiti and unfortunately they said there has now been a confirmed case in Tahiti. Bora Bora still remains clear. Ugh, I fly out on the 3/7 and confused to go or not."
"ALL TOURISTS MUST NOW HAVE THE MED CERTFrom March 9th, 2020, all passengers regardless of their nationality traveling to/via French Polynesia must carry a medical certificate no older than 5 days certifying their health condition, regardless of their port of departure. This measure will be enforced until March 31st, 2020, at which date the government will decide on its possible renewal."
"Shafi A this is not official yet. Not sure how they could have tell you that? I am flying next week and I am also really nervous especially as I am flying through LAX and they found 2 airport medical screener tested positive there. Instead of being happy and starting packing and preparing for my trip I am really stressed out.Edited: 5:41 am, March 05, 2020 "
I'm supposed to leave for Auckland NZ next Fri and going to Bora Bora on the 19th. Not sure what to do. It seems it will slowly but surely get worse. I already have an appointment in Auckland to visit citymed to get a health cert for my family but am serious considering delaying my trip.
Can you delay your trip without loosing money? My travel insurance would not pay any compensation if I decide not to go.
This is such a nightmare. We're not meant to be going until the end of July but the uncertainty of it all is making me feel really stressed and like another poster said the excitement of planning and looking forward to the trip is completely ruined for me. We don't have the option at changing or cancelling either as it is all non refundable and travel insurance won't cover it unless the flights are cancelled. Rant over!Yesh
"I spoke to the St Regis and they are willing to not charge the cancellation fee (which is like $4000). As for the flights I will have to accept the rebooking, unless they all get rid of that fee. In total I think delaying the trip will cost 2,000-3,000 USD. If I'm lucky, a bit less. As folks are stating, this is no way to start a trip to paradise!"
"I feel you! My three adult daughters and I are going mid-April. My general trip insurance won't cover epidemics or pandemics. I checked with my TA on what I could get refunded if I canceled. It will cost me a non-refundable $4,600, plus $500 each traveler for their work, and he didn't know what ATN or Tahiti Air would do about that portion of the cost. So.....I lose up to possibly $8,000 or $9,000 now OR take a chance we all stay well and can get to Bora Bora mid-April. If we don't and I don't cancel now, we lose around $14,000.I only waited 50 years for this trip!WHAT A DILEMMA!"
Can anyone that is currently there update on how the situation is in Tahiti/Bora Bora?
"Air France is allowing flight changes for some depending on dates of travel....""If you have an Air France ticket, issued on or before 31 March, 2020, and valid for a flight scheduled between 3 March and 31 May, 2020, regardless of the destination, you can postpone your trip at no extra cost onto a later flight until 31 may, 2020 included, to the same destination and in the same booking class.""I fall into this travel category but will keep my original flight with AF scheduled for Saturday, 3/7. If I postpone my trip I feel it will get worse before it gets better so I am happy to go now as there are no reported cases as of yet. Also, I booked the St Regis through Pacific for Less and they agreed to let me move my trip at no charge (I declined). Im glad the travel industry is working with travelers due to the unusual and unexpected circumstances.Edited: 12:01 pm, March 05, 2020 "
According Smartraveller.gov.au the medical certificate of good health has to be issued only 3 days prior to travel to French Polynesia not 5. On Air tahiti web site it still shows 5 days.
We leave tomorrow and have a long layover in LAX. Looking to be careful and that is about all you can do. I can be home in the store and someone could have it. This is a trip of a life time and a very expensive one at that! I will let you all know how it goes in LA.
"I have friends who live in Moorea, and of course everyone is afraid. The residents of FP have asked for their borders to be closed. The president addressed them yesterday and said it was not an option at this time because 1) they mainly rely on imported goods and need borders open to eat 2) their own people are traveling and need come and go 3) closing the borders would take away their jobs and ruin them as they rely on tourism. This could change, but that’s where they stood as of yesterday. It’s business as usual, from what I hear. The Asian population and tourists are being treated differently, but that seems to be everywhere as ignorance is everywhere.I leave on the 20th from LAX. My doctor would not write me a note no matter how much I begged, he’s a longtime friend too and writes me notes without questions when I ask. I went against his recommendation not to travel and made an appointment with another clinic for my note. The way I see it is that if I’m going to catch the virus, it can be anywhere. There’s a woman in a hospital less than 5 miles from me that was positive and she was released to go to her home and self quarantine, so I can catch it here or any place I go. Just be diligent and take care of yourself as you would with any sickness. Life for me continues. If the borders do close, then I’ll just have to go with it and figure ought the next steps. Safe travels everyone."
"You can find official information here. You will need to translate it should you not understand French.https://www.presidence.pf/Edited: 2:03 pm, March 05, 2020 "
Do you have any word on how they're treating the Asian population and tourists there? That's going to be very annoying considering there are also other countries that are infected including Italy. So they shouldn't only single out Asians.
"It’s the same as everywhere else. Just like in the US there are people not going to Asian dinning or sitting next to them on public transportation. Doesn’t make sense, but that’s what’s happening many places. Racism never makes sense or the reasons behind it.Edited: 2:55 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Thanks for the information, I guess it's similar to Toronto. As long as it's not brutal like how some people are handling it with physical assault."
"I am also worried, the question do we go or do we cancel. We have to stop at LAX for one hour. They say it’s the plane, air vents, circulation where we need to worry. Anyone else worried about the long plane. I am going first class.Edited: 4:57 pm, March 05, 2020 "
Can you please update us on how it is inside LAX? It will be greatly appreciated!
"It’s really difficult to decide but I guess everyone needs to decide based on their heath and their age etc. I’m sure for many people would be mild if they were unfortunate enough to contract the virus. Good luck, everyone x"
"People please read comment 81. Is it true a confirmed case in Tahiti, omg"
I tried looking everywhere for any news reports regarding a confirmed case in Tahiti but couldn't find any. I hope it was just a case of regular flu..
Sorry if I caused panic. I called the Intercontinental Tahiti again and spoke to the Manager. He assured me that there has NOT been any cases of coronavirus! I flight out to FP on March 7th. Will update. Fingers crossed.
Thanks for informing!
"Shafi A please keep us all updated. I am flying next week and still don't know what to do. I am not afraid of the virus itself, but closing LAX or London airport is my biggest fear."
I don’t know about London but I would be SHOCKED if they closed LAX. It’s such a main hub that it would be detrimental to international travel in the US. It would need to get extremely severe for that to happen which I wouldn’t anticipate for this virus. Even if it’s in the best interest for public health the US government likely still wouldn’t do it. To be clear this is not a political statement as I think it wouldn’t matter who is in office and this would still be the case. We’re pretty stubborn here. Lol
The same would go for London I would say. I would be more worried that FP won’t let anyone in for a period of time.
That actually is a good news. I thought it could happen because they closed airports/ ban flights to China and Northern Italy. I don't think FP will close the airport as well as firstly they rely on goods being imported by cardo planes and secondly they main income is tourism.
"Hi Shafie, can you advise what the doctor wrote for your note? Did the doctor specify you don't carry symptoms of the flu or did he/she write coronavirus? It would be great if you could update us when you travel if you were able to board with no problems. I'm concerned if the authorities are looking for specific wording on the doctor's note."
"S.K,I think it’ll be more useful to know what the medical notes have said after the 9th March (unless the traveller is from a risk zone country) as that is when it becomes a requirement for all travellers to have the medical note. Before then unless you’re from a risk zone a medical note isn’t needed. Starting March 9th, 2020, ALL PASSENGERS (including airline crew) traveling to/via French Polynesia must present a medical certificate, or a doctor’s certificate, dated within 5 days of departure and certifying the state of health free of any clinical sign of detectable infection. This measure will be mandatory until March 31st, 2020 included, from which date the government will decide to possibly extend the measure."
"Yes, that would definitely be useful too. I hope people are able to update us on what their medical note says after March 9 and if there were no issues when presenting it. I'm more curious if we need to have the doctor write no signs of ""coronavirus"" or if it's simply just no signs of ""flu""."
"Hi all,This is what the Four Seasons is saying about the situation:‘Given the special circumstances, we shall agree to postpone your stay within the year of 2020 and waive the cancellation fees, but kindly note that new stay will represent the same room revenue.In other words, unfortunately there shall be no refund nor resort credit.’ To be honest, I don’t really understand what they’re saying. You can postpone but you will still pay again?!"
I had my doctor put no signs of the Corona Virus or any illness. Just to be safe.
Thank you for sharing. I hope the doctors in Toronto are able to specify no symptoms of coronavirus as well.
"My doctor wrote out this for me, its short and simple......To Whom it May Concern, Above named patient will be traveling abroad and found to be free of sickness. No fever, cough, congestion.Please feel free to callDr.....END NOTETechnically I dont need the note as I am traveling 3/7 but things change so quickly I went ahead and got the note just in case"
"Thank you for your interest for our properties. Your comments have dramatically caught our attention as we do believe that no respectable manager would allow himself to make such declaration in such an unstable situation. Especially in two different hotels of the same very serious brand. We have seriously inquired about these and found no evidence of such allegations from our side. The contact details of the ""manager"" you have been able to call twice would be of great interest to us.Directeur Général / General Manager"
"Fancypants, thank you for sharing what the doctor wrote for you. Would you be able to also update us on your boarding experience? This whole situation is stressing me out and I'm sure everyone else too.."
"Way to go Marriott!We're leaving on April 4 and staying at Hilton Moorea and Le Meridien Bora Bora.I found this on the Marriott site:https://marriott-re-2019ncovc.com/We are closely monitoring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization’s statements regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and following guidelines from these agencies and the local health departments.The wellbeing of our guests and associates is of paramount importance. We are waiving cancellation fees for hotel stays through March 31, 2020 for guests traveling to or from the following locations:Asia Pacific: Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, French Polynesia, Maldives, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia, SamoaEurope: ItalyIt's only through March 31 so it doesn't include us yet. Hilton has the same statement about waiving cancellation fees on their website. It's also through March 31 and it doesn't list French Polynesia."
Thanks so much for informing! I guess many people are cancelling their flights to LAX. It must have been nice though to have the whole row to yourselves!
"Hi all,I receive this email from the French Polynesia ministry of health. This was already written in English I didn’t translate it from French. I would say that this means that the words ‘Corona Virus’ do not need to be used in the note. Would people agree? In order to avoid the introduction of the coronavirus responsible for Covid 19 in French Polynesia, the Minister of Health and Prevention of French Polynesia asked all those embarking on a flight to French Polynesia to have a medical certificate dating from less than five days attesting to the absence of clinical signs of viral infection.We ask to the physicien in this context to conduct a clinical examination of the patient to check for the absence of signs such as: fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms typical of viral infection.This examination in no way engages the responsibility of the doctor. It is simply a certificate from a healthcare professional to confirm that the patient shows no signs of viral infection detectable on the day of the exam.The updated information is available on the following website: https://www.service-public.pf/dsp/covid-19/"
"Veronique, which hotel was that message from?"
"Thank you, yesh24. But would anyone care to guess what 'dating from less than 5 days' actually means in practice? Seems to me that the implication of that phrase could well be that the certificate must be dated no more than 4 calendar days before a visitor's flight touches down in Papeete. So, if I was to be arriving on Monday 30 March and that was to be counted as Day 1, then the earliest date for a medical examination which would meet the 'less than 5 days' requirement would be Friday 27 March. Alternatively, if they don't count the day of arrival, then the earliest date for the examination would presumably be Thursday 26 March. Either way, it's not a big window for travellers - especially given the intervening weekend, and especially if they are coming from Europe. Obviously, the FP authorities have to set the rules which they reckon will best protect their people. But, with so much at stake for visitors who get things wrong, it might be helpful if those rules were a bit more explicit."
I think it's five days before boarding your actual flight to FP. Not that it will do any good but yesterday I sent an e-mail to Air Tahiti Nui asking if they would post a printable form on their website with a simple form for the physician to fill in and sign. It really would make it easier for people to know exactly what needs to be stated by the doctor.
The Air Tahiti Nui site changed again last night. There is now a form and an option to have the airline’s medical personnel do a temperature check at the airport. It is interesting that the maxim temperature is lower then what most cruise lines have as their maximum temp. My wife and I leave in 8 days and currently have appointments on Thursday (for our Sunday flight) with our doctor. Not sure if we will keep them and bring a medical form or use the new option.
"Karen and Tom, I would still go to your doctor appointment if I were you just to cover your back."
"@yesh24 - that is our current thinking, but my wife and I read the message differently. She read it that no matter what they are going to take our Temp. I read it that if you have a note, you skip that part. Plus - not sure if this is accurate, there was a Forbes article about a week/10 days ago that referenced that upon landing ""... all passengers would under go Thermal screening..."" I've not seen that reference anywhere else so not sure if it is real."
"Hi, Karen and Tom, I read it as if you have Air Tahiti do the check with their form then you don’t need the medical note if you are not from one of the listed countries. I also heard that they had thermal screening (this is a lot less accurate then them using a thermometer) for FP but I think this is different to them actually taking your temperature with a thermometer which is what It sounds like they will do it you opt for them to do the check in the absence of a medial note. But I read it as if you have been to any of the countries on that list in the last 30 days you do not have the option for Tahiti Air to do the screening for you and you need a medical note. I read like you that you would skip the form and thermometer temperature if you have the medical note (but not the thermal screening) If I were flying soon I would get the medical note if oI could (it’s proving hard in the UK to find anyone to agree to do this) and if worse comes to worse and you need them to do the check with their form then no problem you’ve covered all eventualities (hopefully!) Good luck guys! XEdited: 10:13 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I think this is an important additional note to share as I know a lot of people fly through LAX from other countries as well. This is also on the Air Tahiti Nui site:“ For passengers going to the United States: By amendment, the American authorities have decided that any person having stayed in the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macao) and/or Iran within 14 days before their date of travel to the USA will be denied entry. As a result, these passengers will be denied boarding on Air Tahiti Nui flights to the USA. Exemptions: This restriction does not apply to:-American citizens holding an American passport-Legal permanent residents of the USA holding a permanent resident card (green card) or a parole letter”https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/reinforce…"
"We are currently in Bora Bora. FYI, we went through a thermal screening when our flight from LAX landed in PPT. No questions asked or anything. Flight from PPT to BOB had nothing."
Thanks for taking the time to share -- enjoy your trip.
"Flying Qantas from NZ to PPT on March 31 . My understanding has been that your medical certificate is checked by gate agents before you board. Called Qantas, and they ""don't know nothing about nothing."" Had no idea what their gate agents would want to see. Is my info about checking at gate before boarding incorrect?"
"@Linda F -- the data you are hearing is correct (it seems to be primarily on the Air Tahiti Nui site, but also on the Tahiti tourism site and both link to a government site). https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/reinforce…I wasn't aware Qantas fly from NZ to PPT -- I know Air New Zealand does and I believe Air Tahiti Nui does as well. Which carrier is the operating the flight. You might have a code-share and thus Qantas would be out of the loop if the actual flight was operated by another airline.Edited: 2:27 pm, March 07, 2020 "

"@Karen and Tom, you are 100% correct. No wonder the Qantas agent had no idea what I was talking about. We fly Qantas from MEL to AKL, and then take the Air Tahiti Nui flight booked through Qantas. The hysteria that has been generated is dissolving my brain. We leave for Australia in two days, and will have to get our medical certificate there."
"@Karen and Tom, thanks for the link. I thing I finally get it. There will be medical personnel to screen you at the gate. But per advice given to you, we are going to keep our appointment at a medical clinic in Australia for a ""doctor's note"" just to have a backup."
@Linda F -- I hope it goes as smoothly as possible. Enjoy your trip.
@Karen and Tom -- you as well.
"Those who are already in Moorea and Bora Bora, are you guys seeing any local impact as in business closures (restaurants, shops) or disruptions in local transportation (such as ferry service or shuttle service)? Or is business as usual?"
Just checked into my Air France flight and I was asked for my medical certificate. I handed it over and they went somewhere in the back office (assuming to make a copy) They emerged and returned our original. No other questions asked except if i went to the list of countries on the “list”
"Sitting in the lounge at Tokyo-NRT waiting to board Air Tahiti Nui flight. We were asked to present our medical certificate, which was dated five days ago, as our original NRT-PPT flight was canceled and combined with another one a day later. I would suggest two things: first, keep an eye on your flight for last minute cancellations/changes as airlines trim down and combine flights to limit losses from lack of passengers. Second, for all those who are going bald from stress about the logistics and dynamic/changing situation across the world related to Coronavirus, just cancel your trip already. It’s not worth killing yourself to go on a vacation."
"Thank you for the updates, fancypants2008 and jchass1. Very glad that everything worked out in the end. But, because of the potential for confusion about time zones and dates around the world, plus the uncertainty about 'less than 5 days' for the medical examination, I'd find it hugely helpful if you were able to also post a) the actual date shown on your medical certificate and b) the actual date when your flight to PPT took off. And then …. enjoy your trip: you deserve it!"
Our medical certificates were dated Wednesday March 4th and we departed Sunday March 8th (i.e. the 5th day). We presented it when checking in and were told to be prepared to show the immigration folks in PPT. We’re in flight now so will post again. The medical certificate DOES NOT specifically mention Coronavirus as others have previously mentioned as a new requirement - this is not true. It says that we are healthy and free of any sign of fever or flu. Simple as that.
"Hey fancypants, thanks for keeping us posted! Seems like it will be an easy process as long as we have the required documents. Enjoy your trip!"
"You shouldn't make suggestions for people to cancel their trips the way you just did with that unnecessary comment of getting bald n sht. Why are you so annoyed? For some people the stress is not about getting the damn virus itself, but more so the required documentation because the information online is vague and people want to hear others experiences. If they can get clarification then there wouldn't be all these questions."
"S.K, I agree. And there is the ‘small issue’ that for some of us it is non- refundable and we don’t really want to just cancel it and lose thousands of pounds; That’s the worry not getting the actual virus. So thank you to everyone who continues to share their experiences it really is very much appreciated."
"Hi Yesh, exactly. There are people who will lose money to cancel and so it's not something to be taken lightly."
"I wish I could cancel and reschedule but saved for years and can't afford to potentially lose up to $14,000. My trip is fully paid for and my trip insurance does not cover anything epidemic or pandemic related."
"Made it to Tahiti last night 3/7. Flew out of SFO. No medical certificate was checked at boarding flight or at immigration, however they checked the temperature of each person entering Tahiti right after exiting the plane. A form was also asked to fill out my each passenger asking if they have been to any China in the past 14 days. I believe they are going to start checking for medical certificate starting 3/9 for everyone.Things appear to be calm and business as normal in Tahiti. Plan on going to Moorea today via ferry and fly out to Bora Bora 3/9. Let's c how that transit goes."
@Shafi A -- enjoy your trip and thanks for taking time to update the rest of us. When you landed at PPT was your temperature done via the thermal scan of the incoming passengers or was it literally a person by person temp reading? If
"We will be spending 5 days on Maui before flying into Papeete in early May. From what Ive read on this forum, beginning March 9, a medical certificate from a doctor 5 days before arrival will be needed to enter the country. Has anyone on this thread had to get a certificate in Maui and if so where?"
"Shafi A, thank you for the update. Have an amazing trip!"
"Hi Shafie, thank you for sharing! I hope we can all have the same boarding experience when we travel. Have fun!"
My husband and I booked Tahiti/New Zealand a year ago. We are scheduled to fly from LAX to Papeete next Sunday March 15th. We have doctor's appointment on the 12th for medical certificate and printed out the form that ATN had on their page. Staying 4 nights Moorea and 3 nights Tahiti and then on to Auckland. Checking every day and packing our suitcases today!
"Hi Pamer103, I think it's best to research clinics in Maui and you should contact to see if they're able to provide you a doctor's note and set an appointment. Best of luck."
temperature check was a person by person reading
Thanks for the update Fancypants
Do you have good news about your doctor's note? Thank u.
I just called the CVS Minute Clinic national line and they are not offering doctor's notes for travel. It seems like Urgent Care might be an option if you cannot get in to see your own doctor before traveling.
There is an update on Air Tahiti Nui's site:https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/reinforce…
"So, I read it as - if you are from the US or Canada, and have NOT been to any of the listed countries within 30 days of arrival, you do NOT need to visit your own doctor for a note, just self-complete the posted form? How do others interpret it?"
"Yes, that is how I read it as well. But I I'm still going to get the doctor's note in case they question me since I'm Asian."
"FYI...we made it to Moorea from Bora Bora (via Papeete). Nothing seemed out of the ordinary along the journey of plane, taxis and ferry. There are occasionally mentions of coronavirus at the breakfast buffet at our resort. This morning at a small shop which we visited yesterday had a new sign asking visitors to wash their hands upon entering."
"The president of FP announced today that the first case was discovered. He has asked their people not to travel outside of the country. Continue to watch as since the woman didn't have symptoms during her screenings, they may realize that their requirements do have flaws and will tighten entry or deny it all together, which hopefully is not the case. You can read abut it here. You will need to translate it from French should you not read French.https:/…"
Here is another article that doesn’t require translation https:/…3525d4ea-f042-4a61-b941-a4d523fe404c
"Good find in English, indeed it was reported today. It seems Air Tahiti Nui is the best source for updates and I am thinking it will change frequently as this example shows how having a medical certificate just does not seem to be effective. When we see the proportion this has taken in Italy, we can expect frequent changes to the rules in my opinion."
New information from Air Tahiti Nui regarding flights. I think it’s safe to say that at this point many of us are going to see travel interruptions/cancellations. They said they are doing the best they can with the new travel restrictions but they know there will be issues for their passengers. https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/decision-…
"I suspect this will be even worse for people flying on Air France or French Bee. Our flight is French Bee, and I am honestly expecting it will be cancelled because of the 30 day travel ban that includes France."
"The certificate must be no older than 5 days not 15, you also need to provide a certificate to the airline if you are flying with air Tahiti Nui and you will be checked by a medical professional at check in"
Everyone need a certificate No older than 5 days prior to departure regardless of their country of origin
"No cruises to FP until April. All ships currently sailing in the area must head back to Papeet, disembark passengers and send them home, and not board any new passengers until April 11. Windstar won't resume sailing here until June. Bad news for the FP tourist economy.https:/…"
We arrived yesterday. Our plane from LAX was almost full. Atmosphere here is great! We had to provide health certificate to Air Tahiti Nui staff at LAX and they had scanned it. They have asked about the certificate again once we landed in Tahiti. Everyone had temperature checked. If you have any more questions please let me know.
"More cases of the virus were confirmed in FP which was expected. The government is retracing steps and hoping to contain it. Seems that they are realizing the certificate doesn’t do much. I’m heartbroken but made the decision to postpone our trip to later this year. The airline is unable to confirm their flight schedule after the EU closure that takes affect tonight. With everything closing in the US and the upcoming National emergency address, I didn’t feel comfortable with the possibility of losing my vacation investment, so we rescheduled before it was too late. It is a task as airlines, hotels, agents are bombarded, so be patient if you chose to delay, but don’t wait until the last minute. It took me 20 hours over 3 days to get this rescheduled. Hang ups, wait times and tears. Even with travel insurance, pandemics weren’t covered unless I got the virus or was quarantined and they are taking full advantage of that and not bending. Stay well everyone!"
"This is what is listed on the Tahiti tourism website (https:/…) (which references the government site (which is in French):We recommend to all people over the age of 70 who suffer from chronic or respiratory diseases, to people with disabilities, to reschedule their tripto French Polynesia as much as possible.Since March 9th, 2020, it is highly recommended that all passengers (including airline crew) traveling to/via French Polynesia present a medical certificate, or a doctor’s certificate, dated within 5 days of departure and certifying that the passenger is not presenting any clinical sign of detectable infection. This measure will be applicable until March 31st, 2020 included, from which date the government will decide to possibly extend the measure.Health Assessment Required for Travelers arriving in French Polynesia:If the passenger has a valid medical or doctor’s certificate, he will be allowed to board. Upon arrival at Tahiti-Faa’a airport, he will have to submit a health survey previously completed on board the flight and a simple temperature control will also be carried out. If the passenger follows all these instructions, he will be authorized to leave the airport and continue his trip.If the passenger does not present any medical or doctor’s certificate, he will nevertheless be authorized to embark. Upon arrival at Tahiti-Faa’a airport, he will have to submit a health survey previously completed on board the flight and he will undergo a medical examination which might delay his exit:If his medical examination is normal, he will be authorized to leave the airport and continue his trip.If his medical examination is abnormal, he will be put on health surveillance for 14 days."
"I find the tourism site is a good resource but tend to be behind a day or so. I usually go straight to the president’s site which does require translation. Air Tahiti Nui seems to update before the tourism site as well. The tourism site also doesn’t mention that most flights are unsure of their plans. Still a good resource, just not the most up to datehttps://www.presidence.pf/https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/decision-…"
"Anyone flying French Bee after 3/15, flights to Papeete have been cancelled until 4/10. There is information to postpone or cancel. Be diligent and patient as from my experience with Air Tahiti Nui and my agent, they have to wait on their end to connect with others. It can be a long process.https://us.frenchbee.com/en/nos-alertes"
"@SashaZ, As of 5 days ago, we were still planning to go. We leave April 4 and had scheduled doctor's appt. 3 days prior to get a doctor's note. But changes happened quickly. We were using United, Hilton and Marriott. Marriott was the hold out on their cancellation waivers and finally today, their expanded waiver qualified us. I'm also heartbroken that we would need to reschedule. But it's the best for us and believe that we're doing our part much like how the airline, resorts, travel companies are stepping up."
Hi@liza. I’m glad you were able to reschedule. It’s a good move. The president announced in his address considering more border closures. Stay well and your trip will be even better not worrying about any of this.
"Hello, We have a trip planned on the Aranui 5 for 2 weeks. We leave on the cargo ship which only accommodates 200 passengers on April 11 and come back the 24th going all the way to Pitcairn.. We are flying air tahiti nui on the 9th to papeete.. We know about the medical release.. Do you know anything about this.. I have been checking everyday at the cdc.gov site and tahiti is never mentioned.. This is the first I have heard... Any suggestions or info would be appreciated... Thanks, Flyng out of lax...we are in decent health, my husband just turned 75 and i am 70 in april...Edited: 8:03 pm, March 13, 2020 "
If you are on an April 11 sailing I would contact the company ASAP. The gov’t has suspended all cruises on Tahiti until April 11. Who knows if they will extend this shutdown.
I don't know if this counts as a cruise.. look up https://aranui.com/pitcairn-cruise/It not a big ship or cruise line.. its different so it will still go if we don't get on the boat.. so confused.....
Has anyone had any luck canceling flights for a refund or credit with Air Tahiti? They seem to be the hold out on this. Were supposed to go mid April but I don't see how that's possible with the way things are going.
Where are you going air Tahiti? To Papeete ? They did send us an email about medical note from doctor to give when getting on the plane so confusing
"@heather I postponed yesterday with Air Tahiti Nui and Air Tahiti. Air Tahiti Nui didn’t charge for changes. Air Tahiti charged $250, per person (I think). It took me around 20 hours over 3 days to get my trip rescheduled, so by the time it was done, I told my agent to just charge my card because I was exhausted at that point."
We are booked on AIR TAHITI NUI from LAX to Papeete and then Air Tahiti from Papeete to Bora Bora. Is the only option to reschedule? Is there a time limit?
"You can cancel with Air Tahiti Nui, but not with Air Tahiti. Postponing with Air Tahiti is $250, but there are currently no refunds when you cancel completely. This could change, but as of last night there weren’t any. Air Tahiti Nui posted in their site this evening their new flight plans. Seems many flights from LAX to PPT are not going to happen in the next month. The situation has been changing so rapidly, even in FP, that it wasn’t a gamble I could take. I was on the phone with my agent and Air Tahiti Nui last night, and the airline suggested I postpone due to their unsure schedule that is subject to change.https://www.airtahitinui.com/us-en/decision-…Edited: 2:58 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Sasha, Thank for your info. This tells about what tahiti is doing to protect themselves I kept reading that there was not virus there but now I see different. I don't think showing your are healthy when you board a plane can guarantee a person does not have it..Read this article.. https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-…They really need to share this on the cdc.gov site so people traveling there know there now are cases there.."
"We are leaving in April to Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora. We are going to carry our medical certificates even though we didn't go to any of the restricted countries. I don't want to be turn away because I didn't have one. I am planning on going unless they tell us otherwise !"
"We just flew into Tahiti yesterday, and they were definitely doing temperature checks and taking our medical certificates. Once cleared, though, things seem to be very low-key related to the virus. We are worried about them cutting flights back home, though."
"Too much at stakes here ! I am going to get one within 3 days so to avoid being turn away ! I am also Asian, but I don't really care !"
"How did you contact Air Tahiti? We have to postpone because French Bee cancelled all flights. I could only find a online request, could not find contact information. Do you have that? And if you do, would you share? We have to push ours back to October."
We are flying from Australia to New Zealand then the next day to Papetee then Bora Bora.Now that New Zealand has imposed a 14 day isolation policy how is it handle due to the overnight stay? We are only leaving April 26th so things can change drastically. Thanks for feedback.
"Wico- I do not know Air Tahiti’s contact information. Did you complete the form under the contact tab? I have a travel agent, so she had the details. If I can get in touch with her, I will.If you are staying in resorts, I highly recommend to contact the concierge. Whenever I need help or need them to contact someone, they do.Edited: 11:04 am, March 15, 2020 "
"FYI...We flew back from Papeete last night into LAX. We got to the airport and they apparently changed our flight (this was a surprise to multiple people we spoke to in the Air Tahiti Nui lounge as well). We filled out a two question form while waiting to check in (first question was if we had been to China, Iran, etc and second was if we were US citizens). Most flight attendants were wearing masks and gloves. When we got to LAX, there was no global entry open. However, the news about it taking hours was not correct for us. We were worried about making our connection because of additional screening. At LAX, all passengers went through the same area. No additional forms, temperature readings, questions about countries, etc. It was the normal process.The other interesting part was the new Amex lounge at LAX. They weren't allowing people to get food themselves from the buffet. You walked around it with a waiter and they got the food for you.Edited: 10:51 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"For anyone stuck in FP, travelling to Europe and worrying about no flights between USA and Europe, AIR Tahiti had its first non stop flight from Papeete to Paris - normally there would be a stop in LAX). Anyway it's not a bad place to be stuck in:)Good luck everyone."
"We just flew into Tahiti March 14 SFO to PPT on United. No checks at SFO. They were definitely doing temperature checks and taking our medical certificates at PPT and took an extra 30 mins to clear that check. Once cleared, smooth sailing. Heading to Bora Bora today and will post if there are any controls on inter island flights."
"just flew back home yesterday via Air France after a one week stay in Bora Bora. No issues or delays at LAX. Customs took 2-3 minutes. No medical exams upon returning in the USA. We left for Bora Bora March 7 and during the week we were there it seems more and more borders are locking down. We are glad we have returned home safely. If you do choose to still travel (and are allowed to travel) I wish you the best of luck. My advice is, once you get there dont look at the news or social media. Just enjoy the moment. You are in Paradise!!! Soak it all in.Edited: 5:23 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Yes, I filled out the form so hopefully someone will get back to me. We are rescheduling to October this week. No resorts, we always stay at a specific pension on Rangiroa, and he is no problem with our change. Thanks, Sasha"
"Thank you for this update! We are supposed to fly back from FP on Air France on March 25th, and I am scared they may cancel the flight as I read in the WSJ that Air France is grounding its jumbo jets. Did you hear anything about that??"
"Vero, yes, I heard the same. This is what is posted for Air France. They decreased their flights by 90%https:/…"
"There are 6 of us leaving tomorrow night for Bora Bora and staying at the Four Seasons. Anyone that is there now, how is the atmosphere? Business as usual? Cool, calm, relaxed? It is so beyond stressful here...."
The atmosphere is calm but people worry of course. You might want to check latest information. The government here held a press conference at 12:30 today. Going forward ALL visitors including residents will be placed in self isolement. Inter Island travel will also be limited to essential travel - It is not clear when this will become effective.https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/polynesie/tah…
I can’t find any information on what you sent. The link is in French. Is it even worth visiting? How do they isolate visitors staying in a hotel? Thanks for all the information!
"Cindy- you can highlight the article and use Google translate. We are now restricted from visiting FP. Everyone is required to go through 14 days of isolation, even civilians. They are working on getting visitors back to their homes."
Thanks for the info! Is that what is says on the article?
"Yes. Get on the phone ASAP and reschedule. If you wait until you’re supposed to leave, you may lose your vacation investment. Most travel insurance companies aren’t covering the virus."
The press release took place today (3/16) at 12:30 local time. It is however unclear to when these measures will take effect. The Tahiti Tourism web site provides info that is 3 days old unfortunately. I imagine there will be more formal info available soon but for now best is to contact your resort or TA.
Thank you Maeva. Looks like we all need to get in contact with our travel agencies and start rescheduling.
I just spoke with our resort and there are no travel restrictions in bora bora
"@Cindy - Just so you know I am not making that up, here is the content translated using google:Source: https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/polynesie/tah…- It however does not mention when it will take effect. NZ just implemented the same measures yesterday. I can tell you that if the virus was to spread here, the consequence would be catastrophic as we are not equipped as Western Countries are, some Islands do not even have a MD on location.P1ère • Posted on March 16, 2020 at 1:08 pm""We must go further and we must implement this new step,"" said the High Commissioner for the Republic Monday in Papeete, in the wake of announcements by Emmanuel Macron. The President of Polynesia also spoke from the High Commission.If Polynesia is only at stage 1 of the epidemic, with 3 confirmed cases of coronavirus, we must ""secure the territory"" to ""anticipate the epidemic"" insisted Dominique Sorain, who calls the Polynesians to behavior ""citizen"".Here are the main announcements from High Commissioner Dominique Sorain and the President of the Country Edouard Fritch. Compulsory quarantine upon entering the territoryAny passenger coming from outside will be placed in quarantine for 14 days at home, a ""fortnight"", in self-isolation for residents, for other structures will be dedicated to their containment. ""This is the condition of our protection,"" said Edouard Fritch. Ban on gatherings of more than 100 people and limitation of travelThe population will only be able to move if there is an ""imperative"", for shopping or going to the doctor for example.Travel for convenience and leisure should be limited and avoided.The authorities call on the population not to kiss, not to shake hands. School closings""We need a little time to organize this closure"" conceded Edouard Fritch, who announces the closure of schools ""Wednesday afternoon"". The closure concerns all establishments: primary schools, colleges, high schools, and the University of Polynesia, and should last ""at least three weeks"". Inter-island trips limited to family and business trips onlyNo more tourist trips, it is a question of protecting the populations of the islands, indicated Edouard Fritch. Reception restrictions in restaurantsHotels and restaurants must limit their capacity by two.3 cases of coronavirus have been detected since last Wednesday. There are no new cases declared in the entourage of the patients, on which tests have been performed."
"Cindy- Maeva is correct. I have friends living in Moorea who just contacted me to make sure I cancelled my trip set to leave this Friday before it is too late. The border is indeed set to be closed.FP tends to not be like the US with instant news. Word is starting to get around online within the last hour although this was announced earlier today.Even if Bora Bora does not have a restriction, you will definitely need to pass through Tahiti who won’t be allowing anyone in. And if you are able to make it in before their border closes 1) anyone can be carrying the virus without symptoms and it’s a big risk to this country 2) you will not get the entire experience and will most likely be forced to leave early."
The official information was just posted on the president of FP’s website. The restrictions are immediate.https:/…
"@Sasha Z - It was just updated, I checked the site earlier and info was 3 days old. This will have a huge impact for all of us here but seeing the situation in the US and the world, that is the best decision for travelers as well as the people living here. Just my opinion of course."
"Maeva- I agree 100%. I was going to to travel to FP regardless, then when things started to get worse, I realized I was being selfish and rescheduled last week. We are all in this together and it isn’t about me and my trip. Stay well and I wish the best for you and your people who I love so much."
@Sasha Z - Thank you! The situation is certainly very concerning world wide!
Posted on the tourisme site. 14 day mandatory quarantine for all visitors and residents upon arrival in FP as of this morning at 6am.https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/
"I disagree with your comment about being selfish, Sasha. I think FP relies on tourism a great deal. I am going in June and have not cancelled my trip as I expect BB will need my tourism dollars. And assuming I am healthy will go. I expect the excursion operators, restaurants, hotels and AIRBNB hosts all need our business. If you are healthy and can go, help out the FP! Just a thought."
"True, they rely on tourism, but they are not equipped to handle this pandemic. I have experienced their hospital and Maeva who lives there also said the same. Bringing this virus in to their island will be catastrophic to them. This is why they made a decision to forgo tourist dollars and take care of their resident’s health. We can help them by postponing our trips (which are now required by choice unless a 14 day quarantine is done) and going when it’s safe.Edited: 12:14 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"@Andrew F & Sasha Z - It is nice to see people care, about how living and our health. This decision will be very hard economically for sure but the vast majority of the population believe it is the right decision. Our first case was imported by a Deputy member of the government who visited the Assembly in France. She also thought she was ""safe"" and had visited a Dr in France prior to her trip as it was required by the local government to supply a MD note of good health. Turns out she was NOT safe as she thought, it is today not about one self, it is about being conscious about the propagation we can ALL spread. We will of course really appreciate visitors to come here again to help our economy but for now I think it is wise for everyone to avoid crowds and travel. Better suffer short time from the economy than longer term from the economy and health."
"Wow thanks for posting the update. Not sure what to do now, whether to reschedule to the end of the year or cancel it entirely. Are majority of ppl cancelling their trip instead of rescheduling?"
"We rescheduled without any fees to October and will reevaluate in September. But even before the borders close/quarantine implemented, we had to because the Europe / US travel ban meant that French Bee cancelled all flights from San Francisco to Papeete. And given the rapid spread and that people carry it without symptoms, we didn't want to be anywhere near airports or crowds. I am hoping it is not so devastating in the end as I fear watching globally. We typically spend 3 weeks in Rangiroa every year and will miss it, but for now we are not just not flying, we are basically staying in home except for necessity like groceries of medicine."
"Thanks for sharing. I'm leaning towards rescheduling and will need to discuss with my husband. If we reschedule and things don't get any better, I hope they still offer free cancellation. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy!"
"wico6768, did you book entire trip with Expedia or other vendor?? I booked for 4 - 15 April, w/ Expedia for both flight and resort, so am hoping they are willing to reschedule, as you did, without any fees. However, phone waits to make the change have been long, unable to get through."
"Andy, I booked international air directly thru French Bee website, and I also booked the inter island flight to Rangiroa and back, direct thru Air Tahiti website. For this change, I filled out the request form, and they will make the changes. There would only be a fee with those two if the fares are actually different. For our flights Denver to San Fran, those were by points with SW and my husband cancelled those online and we got our points back. I'm not sure what expedia is doing, though I believe it will be tied to the policy of whatever airline or resort it is. With our SFO hotel, I will likely just lose the points I used because it was not refundable, but it's a couple of hundred dollars.We always stay at the same pension, and we pay him cash when we arrive. He is the one who let us know about potential problems when this all started, and so he just has us booked now for October. We also have a night at the IC in Papeete, and we may lose that,. So the total loss when we are done may be equivalent to 500. Maybe try calling the resort directly also? Maybe since no one can actually get there they will allow you to change the booking? Good luck, hope it works out!!"
"Yes, i'm wondering about expedia too. They want everyone to go through the website and not call but my nonrefundable flight and hotel reservations online are not reflecting the airline (delta/air france) and hotel group (hilton) and their policies which seem to be offering no fee changes. I can't get through to expedia on the phone. Tried Hilton and they said it has to go through expedia. I'm hoping expedia will follow through on this for all passengers or its basically the end of their business IMO"
"We were scheduled to leave April 4 but thanks to cancellation waiver from Hilton, Marriott and United, we cancelled this past Saturday and made new reservations to first week in July. I'm crossing my fingers we can travel by then. If not, Hilton and Marriott new generous policy is you can cancel 24 hours in advance. It's only the inter-island flights that are charging change/cancellation fees. I booked through Costco so it was easy to do. For my United flights, I did it online and took seconds to cancel. Got my credit the next day."
I leave June 1 but am going to see where we are in mid april or May 1. My airbnb hosts have said they would refund 100% I have to play it by ear.
"@ S K - From what I have seen, many people that had booked us have rescheduled (not all) to a later date (May-June from April) speculating the situation will get better. My advice (what I would do) would be to make sure you have some type of travel insurance, private or provided by your credit card to avoid any financial loss."
"Hi Maeva, thanks for the information. Our trip is supposed to be May 8 and we have until April 30 to reschedule or cancel with the resort. That gives us some time to see what happens, but with the amount of new cases rising I don't see it getting any better in the next several months.."
"Wico, thanks for the info. Lorraine, as well. I am hoping that Expedia steps up to the plate and answers the phone and tenders full refund or offers no fee trip change. FIrst leg from VA to LAX, aa.com tells me to contact Expedia. Second leg from LAX to PPT, qantas tells me to contact Expedia. LeMeridien (Marriott property) tells me to contact Expedia but be mindful of constraints at initial time of booking, means I could lose $5K. So I put it on Expedia to give a full refund or a no charge trip change for all air/resort bookings. It remains to be seen if they are willing to step up to the plate. We'll see how it goes. I do take some level of comfort in knowing 'we are all in this together'. Enough of this COVID-19 thing, it's killin' my rum buzz.....DANGIT!!"
"Hi S K - Just so you know, I do not work for the government nor hired to convey messages but I indeed care about people and their experience in FP. Today, chaos is prevailing and travel restrictions change daily. Being from the US, I follow the situation there very closely and it is not reassuring! Locally here, people are starting to realize how difficult the next few weeks and perhaps months will be! Most of the local economy of FP relies on tourism and no doubt it is going to be very challenging but also very challenging for every small business in the world who have to close their doors! Best, is for all of us to not panic, be united and reasonable and hope we will beat this threat swiftly so we can all resume a ""normal"" lifestyle and freedom we once had.Personally, I know i will have a lot free time in April and I will find a way to be helpful to the community that welcomed me here many years ago. It will and should change many of us ways of thinking and behaviors and we all be stronger from this bad episode!FP is not strong on communicating, and unfortunately only in French. I will on my side provide information based on reliable sources when they are available. Stay safe, be responsible and do not dismiss this beast for a simple flu; we all know it is much greater than what it appeared to be!Hope to meet many of you here in Bora someday!"
"Andy, I'm sorry, it doesn't sound like Expedia is stepping up but I hope that they do! Maybe some PR if they don't? It seems to have all blown up at once, and so many people are now and will be, suffering financially and with their health. What a disaster. Truly, it is immense. I hope that Expedia will do what is right, and let you change. I'd also probably challenge this with my CC or bank, given the pandemic and bad behavior by certain companies. Worth a shot. FP is a beautiful place, and the people are wonderful. I hope this does not decimate as I fear it could. Best to you. Hope you get to go when this all sorts out."
"Andy, I'm pretty sure Expedia will step up. I was sharing in your frustration today as I was trying to contact costco travel with no success. This evening i received a cancellation notice for my trip which was scheduled for next week. It stated they were crediting my card due to the recent changes in FP. Make your attempts but don't lose hope as they might already be working on it proactively. Best of luck."
My wife and I will have to place our dream vacation on hold for the time being. But I'll make sure I reschedule it and get out there and enjoy the islands and the culture as soon as possible.
"This is great news, that they are stepping up! I really hope Expedia does as well. Best of luck to you all. Andy and Sergio, when you do go, you will love it. It is, without doubt, our favorite place in the world and I am really hoping the people that we love so much in Rangiroa weather this storm and come out safely. They are like family to us now. When you do get there, you will see this as well."
"Hi Maeva, I can see how it can be a very scary situation for FP but they're definitely taking the right approach in handling this to prevent further spread of the virus even if it means the loss in tourism. It's spreading pretty fast here in Toronto and many businesses need to close down temporarily. Everyone who is able to work from home is doing so for several weeks until further notice. Majority of the cases here are residents that returned from travel so I can see how dangerous it would be for tourists to carry it over to FP without showing symptoms. It's great that you're able to share as much information as possible with everyone here, especially when it's difficult for us to find news online. We really appreciate the insight! I hope things get better soon and that everyone practices social distancing (unlike Florida)!"
Still unable to contact Expedia re changes or cancellation. Has anyone actually had success changing through them or getting a refund? Thanks.
"Our family of 4 has a trip to Bora Bora in 2 weeks. Once we arrive in Tahiti, we are taking a flight from Tahiti to Bora Bora on Air Tahiti. Does anyone know a phone number or email address for Air Tahiti to reschedule or cancel? On their website, all I can find is a page called ""contact us"" that is a form to fill out and submit. I know they are busy, but I filled out the form a week ago and haven't heard back. Thanks."
"@rsandlershamblin and to all - The FP government in FP is now in reaction mode and come up with new measures daily - For a country where the income is almost solely based on tourism, the information is late coming and usually only in French!As of today, Inter island flights FROM TAHITI to other Islands are no longer available to visitors - Only flights from OTHER ISLANDS TO TAHITI remain available, that is at least my interpretation of the article here https://tahititourisme.pf/fr-pf/covid-19/…I personally had clients currently in Moorea and who were supposed to fly out tomorrow to Bora Bora - They found out the resort had canceled their stay and they are unable to get a flight to Bora. This is a very bad situation that clearly lack planning and oversight of the situation, the government is now trying to come up with last minute measures which I am afraid are too late - We are now at 6 cases in FP, that is at least the OFFICIAL report, we could have remained at ZERO cases with our geographical advantage. AS far as local contact, pretty much you are left with the form on their website unfortunately. Just keep a copy of the sent form to cover your bases."

"Sergio, Did you get your money back on the flights? I booked through Costco travel also and there was a fee for canceling, $700. With my job, I couldn’t reschedule because we have to have approval. I wasn’t sure if you canceled or rescheduled. Thanks for any info!"
"We are currently waiting to reschedule, we have until 4/9. We cannot reschedule at this time due to unknown schedules next year, and as of now Air Tahiti Nui will cancel and refund but there is $250 per person fee. So annoying! We booked direct the flights from LAX to Bora Bora. Before when I called they said if the flights were cancelled there would be no fee, but because the government is grounding the flights they can still charge the fee."
This thread is getting ridiculous to read on TA's app. Attention TA your app sucks. Stop giving me notices to do a survey I have already done. And if you sort by the most recent post you still have to go forward and the back. I digress.I redid my ticket with Air Tahiti Nui at no charge. They were very kind to do that. Has anybody else tried? Just throwing that out there. Be safe everybody.
They are being great if you are rescheduling but not if you need to cancel.
Yes I agree. From a business standpoint I understand. And it is difficult to be mad at them as its crazy time.I got tested by the way and it was negative. I dont recommend it. If you have seen the movie Total Recall with Arnold Schwartenegger its similar to that.
Is anyone re-booking their Tahiti trip for the future?
I have rebooked for April 2021. Both airlines and the resorts were very helpful
We have re-booked for May of 2021. We booked with a travel agent so we didn't have to coordinate with the hotel or airline thank God. All we did was choose new dates and they took care of everything. Both the hotel and airline honored the prices we paid when we booked last year so there was no up charge.
"yes you need a less than 15 days old that they have no viral infection papers and previous U.S. ban applying to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland."
