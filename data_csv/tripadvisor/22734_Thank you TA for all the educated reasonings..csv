"Well we both mother and I decided to cancel our trip to vegas. We’ve been weighing our prospects for weeks now and today sealed the deal We are sad to not go especially with all that has gone on with us but we are confident we made the right decision first and foremost for my mother’s safety , mine , that of others should I become a carrier , and should be also be stuck in vegas or any airport should the nation decide to shut down. With the official announcement of the pandemic , and even if vegas and our community has only a few cases , we decided to change our behavior. We would normally not let fear obsess us or control us but this is beyond all of that. But this is however just a leisure trip. I’ve been following massive forums with key statistics , educated reasoning as well as that of the “opposite possitive side “ with all the information I’ve gathered and the constant worry and trying to make reason out of it all I’ve officially decided.... that cancellation is inevitable and the right thing to do. Let us all pray and hope that in a few months this all changes for the better. Thank you"
I appreciate and understand the reasoning to cancel. I just did the same. I am not concerned for my personal health but do not want to risk being a carrier/vector if I come in contact with the virus. Avoiding crowds and taking precautions for the next month/few weeks will enable us to look forward to our next Vegas trip even more! I am looking at booking the Easter Long Weekend and hope the world is on a better place at that time. My brother just had all his business meetings cancelled (in Spain) as Europe goes into full scale isolation mode. Be safe!
Thanks for opening another coronavirus thread. We were running short on them.
I’m looking towards more like May or June. I think even as things get “contained” it will take months to truly figure things out. My mother die the first time today agrees with me when I told her. I SERIOUSLY think we should cancel I’ve been irresponsible With my thinking even though I don’t like to live in fear. This truly is just beyond that
Sorry you’re right. Sorry for yet another one.
That's a very responsible thing to do. Thank you!13
