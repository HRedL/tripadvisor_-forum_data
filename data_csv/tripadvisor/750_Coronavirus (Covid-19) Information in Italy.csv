"BREAKING NEWS:The Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has just announced that the QUARANTINE now applies to the ENTIRE COUNTRY."
this news should probably be in its own thread considering all those still thinking of going and that are there wondering what to do...essential information. Thank you GAC for always having the latest breaking news.
I watched the announcement on TV but I am still unsure what the details of it means for tourists. Hopefully details will come soon.
"# 3My understanding is that foreign tourists currently in Italy will continue to be allowed to LEAVE to return to their foreign residence or domicile.However, persons will not be allowed to ENTER Italy without a documented business or personal exigency, or to return to their residence or domicile in Italy itself.I presume that foreign tourists CURRENTLY in Italy should not travel around the country, and should plan to return home as soon as practicable (not necessarily tomorrow or the next day), unless they have a documented business or personal exigency to remain.I will be on the lookout for any pertinent information on point.In the meantime, people should look at the latest CDC bulletins for Italy, as well as any announcements from one's respective Ministry of Foreign Affairs/State Department."
"Thank you. As the announcement was made around 11pm Italy time, many tourist will wake up in a much different world."
"There is now a temperature check for passengers flying out of Rome to non-Schengen countries, as from March 9.https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/coronaviru…Edited: 7:31 pm, March 09, 2020 "
GAC on post #4Yes. You are right. Things will be as you described.The message given by Government to italians is to hold on any unnecessary activity until all of this trouble will come to an end
"Providing the quarantine is not extended, can anyone tell me what time on the 3rd it actually ends?Thank you."
"Providing the quarantine period is not extended beyond the 3rd April, can anyone tell me what time it actually ends that day?Thank you."
"ArillasGenerally, in Italy, but elsewhere, the decrees are applied to last day included, Thus it will end by April 3rd at 24:00 (midnight)"
"Thank you Raffaele R for clarifying this,We are due to enter Italy on the 3rd, stopover that night in Rimini before sailing from Bari on 4th April.I’ve not contacted my insurers as I’m 99% positive they will not refund my sailing on the 4th unless the quarantine is extended.Good luck you all in these difficult and exceptional times."
Thank you!

"Not all news from Italy are bad news.What about a positive mum giving birth to a negative newborn?This is what happened in Massa Carrara (Tuscany) as reported by the following newshttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/tosc…Google TranslatedCoronavirus positive, with a natural birth and seven-hour labor, she gave birth to a girl who tested negative for Covid-19 research swab. It happened at the Massa hospital (Massa Carrara). The baby is fine and is in solitary confinement in the neonatology department.As reported by the newspaper Il Tirreno, when the mother arrived in the ward, the doctors immediately activated the procedures because some symptoms that she showed had feared that the young woman might be positive at Covid-19. And the sanitary ware were not wrong. The woman was thus hospitalized in the infectious disease department.Dr. Roberto Marrai, who heads the obstetrics department, ensures that the birth took place in maximum safety. ""When the patient arrived, she was not sick, but some symptoms prompted us to immediately request an infectious disease consultation - he says -. The swab confirmed the positivity. Everything happened ensuring the safety of the other guests in the ward and our staff at to which my applause goes for the infinite self-denial "".To assist the new mother, the obstetrician manager Elisa Bruschi, the gynecologist Giovanna Casilla and the midwife Francesca Vitale. ""Francesca - Marrai explains - deserves a commendation. Completely protected, she remained with the woman for 7 hours, she did not move away for a moment. And working seven hours, to assist a woman in labor, with protective equipment, is really hard""."
"I've been tracking reported cases since Monday, March 2. The % increase each day has been fairly constant, averaging about 24% more cases than the day prior EXCEPT TODAY. Today there was *only* an increase of 11% (10,149 vs. 9,172 yesterday). Hopeful news?"
Yes. That is hopeful news. I’ve been meaning to keep track in that way but have not yet done so. I appreciate your info.
"We are booked on a cruise due to end in Naples in six weeks. Seems like the cruise companies are leaving things to the last minute to inform customers what their options are. Some are offering credits if customers want to cancel, but won't compensate if the same cruise later goes up in price. Marella is still booking passengers on cruises leaving Naples and visiting Northern Italy at the beginning of May."
"See Post #20. There were 12,462 cases (total active and closed) reported today (Mar 11) representing a one day increase of 2,313 (12,462 - 10,149). This is the largest 1 day increase reported since I've began tracking these numbers on March 2. In my post #20 of yesterday (Monday), I reported that there was *only* an increase of 11% (total active and closed) as compared to the day prior (Sunday). This was significant because the % increase each day, looking back to March 2, had been fairly constant, averaging about 24% more cases than the day prior. My hope yesterday was to see the day to day percentage of cases (active and closed) continue to trend downward. Unfortunately today's numbers reflect a one-day percentage increase of 22.8%. From March 2 to March 11, total cases (active and closed cases) have increased by an average of 22.4% from the day prior (consistent with the 22.8% one day increase reported earlier today).Please advise if I have erred in my calculations."
"Knifedealer: Re #20 and #23Your calculations are fine, but the premise of your analysis is flawed.I understand that we are all looking for a glimmer of hope that maybe things are getting better. They might indeed be getting better. But the flaw is to try to infer too much from any one single data point. One good day does not make a trend. And likewise, if tomorrow we see an above average increase it does not necessarily mean that all hope is lost.Edited: 3:55 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"IMHO I believe all numbers are wrong. The procedure is correct but it's impossible for anyone to calculate anything without being aprioristic sure of the data used.There is an important data missing by everyone, namely people really positive to virus (asymptomatic and unaware) not only those who have been tested by a swab.The main reason why in Italy patient zero was unknown is because he/she recovered before to know he/she has infected patient one, the 38YO man from Codogno.Likewise many others recovered without even a single cough and nobody is given to know how many are them.Anyway, still my personal opinion"
"Raffaele, Re #25You are absolutely correct.Nobody knows how many people are actually infected. (So mortality rates are not at all accurate.)But, sadly, we do know how many have died. And we do know how many are sick enough to need hospital care."
"Ksoze on post #26""But, sadly, we do know how many have died. And we do know how many are sick enough to need hospital care.""Sure. I agree. More than numbers the challenge is the production of enough assisted breathing devices to cope the needs. With the help of the army we hope to have 125 new devices per weekhttps://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/fabb…Google translatedThe respirator factory that ""hires"" the militaryThe firm aims to produce 500 lung ventilators per month with the help of the armyWe need oxygen. For patients who need intensive and sub-intensive care, and for doctors who obtain beds in other departments in an attempt to expand the offer for coronavirus patients who are struggling to breathe."
"Following post #27Another challenge is to identify an useful drug to be used until a vaccine is ready. Someone says he is on the right way. The hope tocilizumab will work is greathttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/salute/coron…Google translatedCoronavirus, the anti-arthritis drug works: improved a patientThe patient will be extubated.

"Now, there is an even more restricted lockdown, due to end on March 15th, in all of Italy. All shops, restaurants, bars, museums, and other public places are closed for the next two weeks, with the exception of groceries, pharmacies, tobacco shops, newsstands, and petrol stations. You can't be on the street except for a valid reason, which means doctor's visits, grocery shopping, pharmacy trips, or going to help a relative who is not self-sufficient. Absolutely no touristic visits.Even for the necessary shopping, only one member of a family is allowed to go out of the house. Basically, we're all confined to our homes. If it works in slowing down the rate of contagion, it will be worth it. I only wish they would take more drastic measures in the US, where I have family and friends."
Any predictions for travel to Italy in late June?
RobertToo early to know. It depends on too many factors No one can say
"As widely explained, we need vacs or effective drugs to fight it.Then, we must stay at home and highly support research. Donations are surely helpful. Choose the ones that are strongly studying it, in your country."

"#33Any predictions for Florida for April? This is moving very fast and no country exempt. Italy has thrown up more barriers than any other country in Europe. Much higher vigilance, more testing, more controls, more social policy, income support, mortgage relief, business support, tax relief etc. Way ahead of any other western country. I expect those more backward in planning and resources will be in more trouble than Italy soon.New Zealand today announced a 14 day isolation for all arrivals from anywhere from midnight. Even New Zealand.This stuff is not ending soon. Chinese support for Italy now, doctors and supplies, surely has humanitarian value but note that China having wrestled the problem down is now watchful for infections arriving from other countries. Unless strong containment is in place to try to eradicate more widely, as China achieved on a limited playing field, containment will not eradicate and the second purpose of containment becomes the main one, limiting spread while vaccines developed and found safe (unlikely this year). Such containment may succeed in Italy but in northern Europe and north America and perhaps here, hardly likely.

"Nice to hear your voice Natasha, I’ve just been wondering how you are. I was writing in very understated way. Your emphatic message more appropriate.

"Chinese doctor to Spallanzani (Hospital in Rome): You did a good jobExcellent cures to the healed Chinese couple first positive cases in Italyhttps://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cronaca/202…Google translated""The Italian hospitals are doing an excellent job. We were able to see for ourselves the conditions of the now healed Chinese couple. We are happy."" One of the doctors of the Chinese team who visited the Spallanzani in Rome said so today. ""The treatments that the two spouses received were excellent - he added - and the more than positive treatment. We also found the couple's excellent mood. We found that the treatment used by Spallanzani's colleagues was good because there are no been complications and the situation is under control. """"The important thing is to frame the positive cases early, treat them quickly and implement the quarantine measures to stop the infections as quickly as possible. These are the measures also adopted by China and we find that Italy is also adopting them"". So one of the Chinese doctors of the team who today visited the Spallanzani in Rome. ""These are not measures invented by China - he added - but they are international measures, shared by all countries in case of emergencies like this"".""The Spallanzani Institute today welcomed a delegation of 9 people from the Chinese Red Cross made up of doctors and researchers who have been at the forefront of the fight against covid-19 in China."" So Spallanzani's today's bulletin. ""The Chinese delegation - continues the bulletin - exchanged with the Spallanzani scientific community any useful experience in order to share diagnostic and therapeutic paths for the prevention and fight against the new coronavirus and finally visited the Chinese couple now clinically healed ""."

A Chinese doctor said to me once “you must save half your chi for yourself “. ...save half your energy, half your emotional resources for yourself. In family life the saved half can often be spent by 9am of course. But an energy budget is very valuable. Such has been my experience with chronic illness from the 1980s.

We need you well and your friends and families well, Raffaele, Natasha ... and other contributors to this forum who live in Italy. .....For the new, we had established two threads, of information and discussion, well before TripAdvisor established this thread, presumably when they set up this kind of discussion in other countries.

"I spoke of Italy ‘being first’. I acknowledge the suffering and efforts in China and South Korea, regimented life in China, more orderly and educated than most countries in South Korea, places with which I have had close connections. But Italy is first among western democracies with habitual disorder among liveliness. Source of European invention. Addressing issues in ways more familiar to most readers. As there are things to learn here too in Korea http://english.hani.co.kr/I have found it frustrating that a great weight of TripAdvisor Italy discussion in thr past has been about rushing past the people to get to Big Items.

EugeneNobody can tell when all of this will be over. My suggestion is to wait until the last day you can before to decide what to do
"#60, 61. Eugene, we don’t know where you are. In the event, unlikely, that Italy has ‘solved’ its problem it will probably still be excluding visits especially from countries whose approach to COVID-19 is less intelligent, less thorough, than Italy’s. I encourage you to read back through the ‘official’ discussion and follow links to what the Italian government is doing in social and economic terms, not just medical. Lobby for such sense near your home. Yesterday I saw neurologist and showed him #269 at https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…And he was a little shocked. Today I saw family doctor who said he had just received that transcript of mine from a colleague, by email. The problem in Italy and soon elsewhere is the enormous burden on health professionals. There is also the problem, addressed in the Italian prime minister’s weekend interview, that only 62% of people surveyed support what the government is doing. Wherever we are we have to sit up and smell the smoke and realise the fire is real. The greatest risk is wherever people do no take all this seriously... plus the huge risk among the 30% of the world’s population who lack water and cannot follow the basic first step of hand washing. Italy’s closures seek time for the rest of the world. Firstly, time to squeeze this virus out of existence by confining it. Because of slackness in other countries that’s failing. The second purpose is to try to minimise spread before a vaccine is available. That’s a year away.Edited: 8:30 am, March 19, 2020 "

I don't know if the quarantine is going to stop the virus. I don't know if it will still be possible.

The crematorium of the Piacenza cemetery is on tilt and a hundred coffins have been piled up in the 'leave room'. The newspaper Libertà explains it. There are 314 deaths in Piacenza since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, but the oven at its maximum capacity can handle a maximum of 12-13 cremations per day, while the coffin that arrives daily is 20-25."

And, on the contagions slowing down for two consecutive days, he adds: ""The measures of two weeks ago are starting to feel."""
"I suspect that you are right about there being more likely 600,000 cases in Italy, Raffaele. I read something the other day where a doctor in Lombardy said there are many more cases that never come to the hospital and never get tested. This means, of course, that your mortality rate is not as high as it looks.As for the large increase in new cases in the US, we were told by our Centers for Disease Control to expect this, since the high-volume testing has just become available in the last week. We now have drive-through testing sites here in Dallas. The large, commercial labs, which are private companies, are now set up to process huge amounts of tests. For most people, this is covered by their employer's health insurance plan. For others, the government pays for the testing."

"High mortality in Lombardia? Not as much as in Madrid and New York. To my Spanish and Usa friends, stay strong.https:/…Google translatedMortality in Lombardy? High, but lower than New York and MadridA study just accepted by Lancet Public Health sheds light on the data of deaths in the first month of the epidemicCoronavirus mortality in Lombardy in the first 30 days of the epidemic was high, higher than observed in Paris and London, but much lower, about half, than in New York and Madrid. This is what emerges from a study accepted by the prestigious Lancet Public Health. In particular, explains the virologist Roberto Burioni on his Medicalfacts website, the trend of the coronavirus epidemic was assessed, in reality comparable from an economic-commercial point of view: five in Europe (Lombardy, Ile-de-France / Paris, Brussels -Capital, Greater London / London and Comunidad autonoma de Madrid) and one in the United States (New York Metropolitan Area).The researchers assessed the evolution of the mortality rate in the first 30 days of the epidemic, starting from the day on which the first three deaths were recorded. Analyzing this parameter, they realized how the mortality trend in the first 30 days of the epidemic in Lombardy was yes higher than what was observed in Paris and London, but clearly lower (about half) than what was observed in New York and Madrid.This is despite the fact that Lombardy is the first region in the Western countries to have been hit hard, thus not being able to take advantage of containment experiences already put into practice in similar realities."

This is just one of the many reactions of traders to the new anti-contagion measures provided for by the new dpcm signed by the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The direct of the premier on the illustration of the new measures has in fact sparked a series of controversies, both for the lack of clarity in some points but above all by the owners of some commercial activities such as hairdressers, beauty centers, wellness and in general the activities concerning personal care, which must respect the closure until June 1st. The two owners of the hairdressing salon 'La dolce vita' in Corso Milano, Padua, have tied a chain of wrists and body to those used for the delimitation in the rows, acting as a spokesperson for all their colleagues who are in the their own situation.THE PROTEST - Agostino Da Villi and Stefano Torresin explained the reasons for the protest: “We cannot remain closed yet. We are ready to open, we will respect the rules, but we cannot stand still ”. The two owners in fact say they are ""equipped for security measures"" and launch an appeal to be heard by the government. According to Da Villi, “we hairdressers are used to working according to hygiene standards and we have all the material to shoot: visors, gowns, gloves, sanitizing gel. Does Conte want me to believe that a one hundred square meter room with two workers and two customers is less safe than a bus with 20 people? ”. Torresin is also of the same opinion as his partner and points his finger at the government on the 600 euro bonus, pushing to reopen as soon as possible: ""Every month we have a fixed expenditure of 20 thousand euro - explained the owner - we are two partners and we have three employees, with the banks there is no dialogue and we certainly cannot afford to make other debts, the money from the state has not yet arrived, until yesterday evening we hoped for a restart in May, for which we are already equipped, wait until in June it is unsustainable, we ask the Region to turn its gaze to us.

The package is complex as a whole, but details for particular places will, hopefully, be easy for people to read... and follow. We are headed in similar direction here, but we do not have the tragedy of recent months which Italy has experienced as the first open country to be thrown into the epidemic.

We still don’t understand it fully, it will continue to modify, we have no vaccine and we grasp at ways to cure. Workers and managers will hopefully not be pitched against each other, struggles between money and life not too bitter. There are still three hundred people being killed by the beast every day in Italy. We wish that number to continue down. I hope those keen to visit Italy will respect the huge burden on health services, city management and the day to day lives of ordinary people. They should find a nurse or doctor who is not exhausted and ask that person about hastening to Italy. With admiration!Vi salutiamo! We salute you."

This is a measure decided by the mayor Beppe Sala to try to enforce the regulations for Phase 2 and avoid gatherings especially in the nightlife places. The decision came at the end of a meeting with the prefect Renato Saccone.No to alcohol consumption - The ban on takeaway will affect not only bars ""but also local shops but not supermarkets"", explained Sala. ""In fact, what we will sanction will be the consumption of standing alcohol if it is not in a dedicated place, defined as a space facing the bar,"" added the mayor. The rule will go into effect on Tuesday evening after an order from the mayor.But no to early closings - There will therefore be no early closings or changes to the opening and closing times of the bars: ""We do not place time limits on the closure of the premises .. We thought about it but it is not worth it to not penalize the commercial services and because maybe the situation can even get worse, ""added Sala.

My guess is it will be extended at least until July 1. From the number crunching I am doing right now it looks like the US infection rate is .00624 which is almost double Italy’s rate. So who knows what will happen. Time will tell within the next few weeks. Also waiting for bans to be lifted on EU visitors to the US.
Hi VidhurThis is a nice thread to follow on the matterhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…
i Think her e not update condition of Italy due to covid anyone can share the information please
"Hi JamesI am sorry but I am not sure I understood for what condition of Italy you are looking for updates.Apart from social distancing, no gathering and wearing masks, life isn't a lot different than before Covid"
"In Italy the big factories are usually closing in August for one or two weeks, to permit employees to spend their holidays.Not the next Augusthttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/economia/cor…Google translatedCoronavirus, the business idea: ""No holidays, we work in August""Several companies have hundreds of outstanding orders to deal with because of the lockdownFor now it is an idea that is catching on among businesses in the North, from Piedmont to Veneto: now that Phase 2 has restarted, it would be a shame to stop in August for the holidays. Especially for companies that have hundreds of lockdown orders outstanding. ""It is a moral obligation not to stop production"", explains Enrico Carraro of the Veneto Confindustria. In many areas, the effects of some government measures, such as the eco-bonus, are looked at with interest.Timid openings also come from the world of trade unions, such as the CGIL Veneto. For the secretary Christian Ferrari ""we have already made agreements with some companies to anticipate and postpone the summer holidays and there is no foreclosure but without any automation. Finally, I still have the doubt whether all this work will really be there in August, the clear feeling is that they are single specific cases "".In Piedmont, for example, Mirafiori should remain open, even if not at full capacity, where workers will be needed to produce the new Fiat Chrysler 500 electric line. Fiom will also remain open, also Omt, Officine metalmeccaniche Torino, which employs 200 people in injection systems.Moreover, Carlo Bonomi himself, president of Confindustria, has promised that his organization that brings together companies in August will remain open. ""I hope - however he had said in recent days - that the Italian Parliament does not close in August, it would really be a disappointment""."
Hi. My wife and I are U.S. citizens but we own a home in Italy (Marche). We do not have Italian citizenship or residency. We are VERY interested in getting to our house this summer and are willing to self quarantine. My question is what actually happens on arrival? Is the quarantine more of an “honor” system so that we can pick up our rental car and drive straight to our house or will we somehow be detained or even not allowed entry? Would love to hear anyone’s experiences or knowledge about this. Thanks. Adam
"There is official information in this link, especially FAQs 5 and 9. https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…It looks like you can pick up your rental car and drive straight to your house, then you have to notify the local health authorities of your arrival. I believe they check in on you daily for the next 14 days. Someone will come along to confirm this.You'll need to have someone shop for food and supplies before you arrive; you won't be allowed to go to the store."
"Hi AdamI have no experience with it. I searched on the Internet in Italian and English but no results.The best suggestion I can give you is to ask to the Italian Consulatehttps:/…or to the Italian Embassyhttps:/…itAnyway, in the following thread, one Canadian traveler reported on post #8 to have his childhood house in Italy where to stay during quarantine.

Thanks to both Raffaele and to Texas for the helpful responses. We’ll have to see what happens next with announcements from Italy. Not looking too good as the virus seems to be gaining some energy again here. BTW I have reached out to the Italian embassy in D.C. but have not heard back. We may just try our luck getting to the house and quarantine for 14 days....just don’t want to get turned away at Fiumicino!
Good luck! It might help to bring your official paperwork related to your home ownership in Italy with you in case you have to plead your case with Italian authorities to let you in.

"Hi , We have a villa booked for 5 families on 15th August. What are the rules around large groups staying together in Italy? We were contacted by the villa owner to say he had decided to reschedule all large group bookings into 2021 due to the local social distancing rules Making our stay impossible to manage but when we informed him we were unable to reschedule and requested a full refund he then backtracked saying we could stay after all. We do not wish to be in a situation where we are going against these rules. Any advice much appreciatedThanks"
"Hi Em HeffPlease, where is the villa in Italy and where are your group of families from? Some regions apply additional rules but all of them require social distances for people not of the same family (meaning living in the same house).I don't know what the rules will be by August 15th. We were waiting for some restrictions to be eased by July 1st for extra EU tourists but I am afraid it won't happen.In addition, in Italy, we have several new virus outbreaks to be worried about. There are new red areas appearing spotted every day. In Caserta, a whole block of buildings has been isolated a couple of days ago.If you are from the EU you'll not be requested to quarantine by actual laws, but the future is uncertain. The situation will remain under control, and hopefully will, but if the number of new positives will grow out of control? It is a nightmare to even think of such an eventuality.In my humble opinion, too many factors to consider to make a correct prediction. Rescheduling into 2021 could be the best possible option."
"Thanks for responding . The villa is in le marche. We are from the UK We are not in a position to reschedule for next year. We are in dispute with the villa owner as although he wrote to us informing us the need to reschedule due to social distancing rules, when we responded saying we could not make it work next year (various reasons) and requested a refund for this year, he then Backtracked saying it was possible for us to stay as a large group ,just complicated . Following his instruction, members of the party cancelled other parts of the trip so even if it was possible for our group to stay in Italy , we can no longer come! He’s basically refusing to refund our money even though he wrote to us effectively cancelling. We had an agreement with him to wait until the end of June to see how things were before committing to pay the full balance but some members of the party have paid their share already and he’s refusing to refund the money!Edited: 6:58 pm, June 26, 2020 "

"Hi everyone,me, my girlfriend and two other friends are planning a 5-day trip to the north of Italy (the lakes in particular) by our private car between the second and third week of July. As of now, our plan is to rent one house for the whole duration and stay there together.We are currently trying to pool up all information regarding the coronavirus measures but some questions still remain unanswered:We are technically from three households, however, as we are obviously going to share one flat in Italy, I was wondering whether our group is going to be treated as ""one houshold"" then?In that sense, I understand that we would not have to wear masks inside our car, is that correct?Lasty, will we be able to e.g. make a reservation at restaurants, cafes, etc, in case the current ""laws""/measures will not treat us as one household? In other words, can four persons from, in that case, three different households go to a restaurant together after all?Thanks a lot for your answers in advance :)"
"IMHO, to mean people of the same family, the Italian Law uses the word ""congiunti"". The literal meaning of the word is people who are permanently together.If you are permanently together with the people you are traveling with, then you are ""congiunti"" and you don't need to comply with the social distance rule either in public or in private places.If you go to a Region where you have to register your arrival, then you'll have to register all together living in the same place"
"Alright, thanks a lot!So in other words, as we are neither family, nor living in the same household permanently, we will not be falling under the category of „one household“?In that context, the term „permanently“ plays a major role as this could in theory also be understood as „longer than just the occasion“."
"Yes. I believe the meaning ""longer than just the occasion"" makes sense.When you are in your country you don't live in the same house and you aren't the same family. But, when you are in Italy you share the same car, sleep in the same house and visit the same places. I believe you can be called ""congiunti"".The Italian Law didn't use the word ""familiari"" for members of the same family or ""parenti"" for people linked by a blood keen. It didn't use the word ""conviventi"" for people living in the same house either or any other word I can guess.I believe the Italian Law used the word ""congiunti"" for a reason.Anyway, to make sure, you can ask the landlord or the rental agency. They might have a better answer. Tell them you are going to live all together during your trip to Italy."
"Hi all,We're looking to travel to Italy (Sicily + Calabria) in mid-July from the UK. We carry New Zealand passports, but have lived in the UK on work visas for 6 years.

963akshatm were you able to safely enter Italy?
"Hi, firstly, i apologise if im asking questions that have already been answered. We have travelling to Italy in 3 weeks to to Milan, Lake Como, Verona and Venice. My question is, i know we'll need to book restaurants in advance but what about city attractions such as museums, the Gondolas in Venice etc? Also, we will be taking a train and then boat from Milan to Lake Como and a bus from Verona to lake Garda, will we need to pre book tickets for public transport or can we simply purchase a ticket at the train/bus stations? Many thanks,Rob"
"Booking is always highly recommended. It is mandatory only in places with a normally high affluence.For example, you don't need to book to visit the Duomo, but you have to when visiting Pinacoteca di Brera.To enter in Pinacoteca you don't need to buy a ticket. The entrance is free until September, 30th, but you must book your visit herehttps://brerabooking.org/it"
"Thankyou for the help! Will we need to book public transport tickets in advance? I read somewhere that pre booked train tickets must be used within 4 hours, is this true? Thanks"
"#195The ""4-hour rule"" refers to ELECTRONIC tickets for Trenitalia UNRESERVED trains (the ""regionale"" and ""regionale veloce"" trains). The 4-hour restriction does not apply to PAPER tickets for these UNRESERVED trains (but the ticket must nevertheless be used on (and only on) the date noted on the ticket for travel).I usually advise AGAINST purchasing tickets in advance for the Trenitalia UNRESERVED trains. There is no fare discount in doing so, and ordinarily the downside of buying these tickets in advance outweighs the advantages (which are really quite few in reality). Seats on these trains are unreserved, which is yet another reason to NOT buy tickets in advance. I recommend buying PAPER tickets for the UNRESERVED trains directly at the train station (either from an electronic ticket machine or at the staffed ticket sales windows, where available) 30 minutes prior to train departure. You must validate these PAPER tickets in the little validation machines at the track head before boarding the train. (Validation time/date stamps the ticket so that it can't be used again later in the day on a different train for the same segment).You CAN save quite a bit of money by purchasing tickets for the RESERVED trains in advance, and getting a low promotional fare. But you need to be very careful, as these promotional train tickets are usually non-refundable and some are non-changeable as well. You must read the rules and restrictions prior to buying these tickets. Moreover, in the age of COVID-19, I believe it is particularly helpful and prudent to not lock oneself in and to maintain maximum flexibility, even with the consequence of paying more for the train. tickets. Tickets for the RESERVED trains do NOT need to be validated, as they are valid ONLY on the specific train at the specific time/day noted on the ticket itself."

"#212Your situation is not expressly covered by the Decree of the Italian Minister of Health dated August 12, 2020, as far as I can tell from reading the materials.https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…You will need to explain this to the border control agents upon your arrival into Italy. As you will be departing Italy within 24 hours of your arrival, I suspect (but do not know) that they MAY waive the testing requirement (unless you are tested at the port of entry itself). I say this in part because in the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers dated July 8, 2020, there is an express exemption from any quarantine requirement (but not from any testing requirement) for anyone transiting through Italy within a period of no more than 36 hours. See Article 6, Paragraph 7(b) of this decree:https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…PLEASE NOTE that I am extrapolating and applying by analogy this exemption for persons who transit through Italy, because by its own terms, the exemption does NOT apply to persons entering Italy from any county on Official List ""B"", which includes GREECE. Nevertheless, because the testing must be done within 48 hours of arrival into Italy, and you will be departing the country within 24 hours, I suspect that the testing requirement does not apply to you, using common sense interpretation.As I am not officially authorized to interpret these regulations, I recommend that you inquire with the Italian Embassy in Athens for clarifications.

"#214I don't know the cost, nor whether travelers are charged or whether the cost is absorbed by the Italian Government. Costs of QUARANTINE are the responsibility of each traveler, but I have not seen any definitive information on the costs of testing.If you are tested at the port or airport of entry, the results are SUPPOSED to arrive within about 20 minutes.If you were found to be ""positive"", I SUSPECT that you would be required to quarantine for 14 days OR until you transit out of Italy within 36 hours or so, whichever first occurs. If you were positive AND had symptoms, you might have a problem exiting Italy by public transportation (such as by bus, train or plane).I am not at all surprised by your having heard that people are not being questioned about the testing requirements when they pass through border controls in Italy. The testing requirements are brand new, and Italian Media has widely reported that local health authorities ARE NOT YET SET UP to conduct testing at most ports of entry, and are understaffed. There is a tremendous amount of confusion, not just on the part of travelers. Unfortunately, the Ministerial Decree was promulgated before Italian health authorities had the time to prepare, and indeed, the regional governments of LOMBARDIA and EMILIA-ROMAGNA have stated (yesterday) that they won't even attempt to fully enforce these new requirements (quarantine while waiting for results of the COVID-19 test conducted in Italy). I don't know whether this is still valid today or tomorrow, however.PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING CORRECTION to my posting #213:The date of the ""Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers"" is August 7, 2020, and not July 8, 2020. My error."
"wow you seems to be very informed, thanks very much for your detailed answer.I would obviously not move if I had it with symptoms.Is there an expiry date for this requirement ? i read 7 September, and somewhere else 13 SepThanks."
"#216. Have not paid attention to a specific expiry date, primarily because I fully anticipate yet more changes, plus expiry dates for COVID-19 measures are known to be prone to being extended."
"Please can anyone help, we are travelling from Spain to Italy Trieste tomorrow. We haven´t had a covid test. We have a car booked and are driving to Croatia, we have a hotel booked there. As we are leaving Italy immediately will we still have to get a covid test?"
"#218Persons IN TRANSIT through Italy for a period of time LESS THAN 36 HOURS should be exempted from both the COVID-19 test and any self-quarantine requirement.See Paragraph 6.H) of the self-declaration form:https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…In your case, I assume that you are arriving at the Trieste airport and renting a car to immediately enter Croatia. Getting a COVID-19 test for Italy would make no sense, since you are in transit out of Italy, and indeed you will already be exited from Italy when the test results would be reported to you.If you encounter any issue at the passport control desk, explain your situation to the agents. I don't think that you will be subjected to a test.In my response above, I do not address any entry requirements for CROATIA.Edited: 8:20 am, August 30, 2020 "
So come here for 36 hours and spread the virus.Exempt.Lovely!Vagabonda
Please can.anyone clarify which masks must be worn on flights to Italy? EasyJet says respirator masks and Ryanair says surgical masks.
"I would follow the directive of the specific airline which you are flying to Italy. In case of doubt, bring both types of masks. I am skeptical of using respirator masks if they allow emission of breath from the person wearing them (does not protect others).Once in Italy, however, you should be using a surgical or cloth mask when indoors in public venues, as well as outdoors (where there is no social distancing possible outdoors)."
We will be flying back from Italy to UK this coming weekend. EasyJet have sent us a text to say that we need to have a disposable surgical mask (or higher grade if we wish) for use during the flight.
