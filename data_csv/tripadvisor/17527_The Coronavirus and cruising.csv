"We are cruising to Alaska - large family trip - in early June but nervous about the coronavirus and cruising. Should we cancel the cruise and do it all by land. 4 teens going with us, youngest is 12; 2 seniors. Suggestions?"
You should do whatever works best for your family. It is entirely a personal decision. Deb
"FYIYou are going to be flying to get there; so if the Covid-19 virus (new name) is not under control by then, you will have similar issues getting to Alaska to do a land tour.so like Deb said in Post #1"
On a cruise ship you have a much better chance of getting the Norwalk virus .Seeking advice from your doctor and more importantly the doctor of the seniors should be your first step .I am not a doctor but I play one on TripAdvisor

I would go ahead with the cruise ...get good cancellation insurance just in case.
"Most cancellation insurance would not cover this situation because it is now a known risk.From a recent article:""If travelers have trip insurance, is this something that they can cancel on their own because of the coronavirus outbreak?“Well, typically that is not a covered reason to cancel,"" said Morrow.""She said trip insurance worked for people who were in China before the CDC issued a travel warning, covering what would have otherwise been costly evacuations.""If you purchased travel insurance before the outbreak, but haven't left yet, it's unlikely your trip is covered because the coronavirus is now considered a ""foreseen event.""“Anything purchased after that, you purchased it after you were aware that this was a problem,” said Morrow.""The only exception? Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) travel insurance.""https://turnto10.com/i-team/consumer-advocat…BTW, neat map that keeps track of people diagnosed with this virus: https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
You need to look at “Cancel For Any Reason” insurance. You typically have until 48 Hours before your departure to cancel. This insurance usually refunds 75% of COVERED prepaid expenses. For further info:https:/…
"I think that it is totally irrational to be concerned about covid-19. All cruise lines have adopted the CLIA recommendation to implement strict restrictions on people who are from, or who have previously travelled in certain risky countries.There are 15 know cases in the USA at present. Does that stop you going out to do the shopping, going to work, or to church. Two sources of the infection being passed on in Singapore were through churches."
"Yes, Cancel for Any Reason is the good coverage Is what I was referring to Marshmallow ;)"
I’d be checking to see if the price of your cruise is dropping at this point
"Look into cancel for any reason insurance if you’re worried. HOWEVER, at this point you have a much greater risk of norovirus (stomach bug) and rhinovirus (common cold) traveling by plane and cruise ship than you do coronavirus. Coronavirus is scary because it’s new and being sensationalized by the media—but influenza has infected and killed exponentially more people at this point. At this point in time, I don’t think it’s something to really freak out about and change travel plans if your travel plans don’t include an affected area (ie China). Keep up with coronavirus information (from the CDC and WHO, not media outlets who exaggerate) and make an informed decision when the time comes."
"Our cruise line rates dropped a bit, for Alaska this summer not sure if it's related or not to the virus scare. Though I have had a few people from my group decide to cancel because they're worried about this virus. I think the cruise ships practice safer sanitary cleaning than most places you go out in public. I constantly see the staff cleaning, including the walls, during my cruises (I go on them frequently because I'm a tour director that gets sent with groups). Plus all the lines I've been on this past year always have staff standing around, especially in dining areas, with spray and hand sanitizers insisting you clean hands before entering. I guess you can be susceptible almost anywhere, so you can hide at home or live your life."
"cancellation insurance has to be purchased within 24 hours of buying the trip, so buying it now will not help you at all. I would go to all your doctors and see what they have to say, saying this though your cruise is still 4 months aways , you could still get it on land . do what is best for your family only you can know what is best with all the advise for the medical profession"
"Nobody ever talked about not going on a cruise because of Influenza A and Band https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-…and on Time.com sitethe CDC estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. That’s fairly on par with a typical season, and well below the CDC’s 2017-2018 estimates of 48.8 million illnesses, 959,000 hospitalizations and 79,400 deaths."
"""Nobody ever talked about not going on a cruise because of Influenza A and B""Might be that people are taking more about it because it's so much more deadly than the flu as noted in a paragraph in the article you referenced.""The coronavirus outbreak, however, is proving to be more deadly than the flu. It has killed roughly 2% of the people who have contracted it so far, according to world health officials. That compares with a mortality rate of 0.095% for the flu in the U.S., according to CDC estimates for the 2019-2020 flu season."""
"DelRock...I believe 14 people have coronavirus in the USA....doesn’t sound very high risk to me. If I was concerned, I would be just as concerned going on a plane, which the poster would be doing if he goes on a land tour of Alaska."
"#4 post most likely nailed this OP. First post, and haven’t been back. Classic. Deb"
"@LenI don’t think it’s much of a risk either at this time. I do think it is important to show some balance to the article that was sited instead of cherry-picking what one person wants people to believe. It is also something not to turn a blind eye to. There are twice the number of affected individuals in the US now. Cruise lines are rerouting ships and developing new itineraries to avoid Asia in the near future.We’re actually looking for fare drops to Alaska this season. Things would have to get worse before we’d consider not going, but we’re watching."
Instead of looking at sensationalist junk media for information you should be reading what the scientists are saying.https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20203
+8 - We are leaving AK in a few weeks for cruise out of San Diego to Hawaii for 18 days. I've been sick on several cruises from those with the flu. The flu is something more to be concerned with IMHO.
"We are also booked to cruise Alaska from Vancouver but for May. We received an email from the cruise company (HAL) yesterday offering us a full credit (not a refund) if we choose not to go. We are currently covered by insurance (if we get sick, not to cancel if we opt out) as we took the cover before covid19 was a known risk but if declared pandemic the cover is void as with most policies. At present we figure we have about the same chance of catching it at home in our normal lives as on the trip as infection rates are similar here as in Canada/Alaska.Edited: 6:33 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"We have an Alaska cruise booked for May 25th. My fear is NOT catching coronavirus but if just one person, out of thousands, on board has it then we go into mandatory quarantine. Being confined to a tiny room on a ship would be my biggest nightmare! Still undecided as to cancellation- we'll wait until time gets closer. By then the cruise may be cancelled by Norwegian anway."
"""Still undecided as to cancellation- we'll wait until time gets closer. ""I think Canada made the decision for you. You're not going."
DelRock....lol!
Does TA offer 'sensitivity training'. I sometimes think I'd have to be first in line for it; but DelRock is challenging me. :p
"Scott, I know people who are going to lose hundreds of thousands... Some of them will go out of business. They laugh because that is about all you can do. While I agree it does not go along with 'sensitivity training' .... A vacation being canceled is not quite as serious in my book. You do not find it funny... I do. Seward is best! lol Best.... BoatAk"
"Sense of humor is all we got at times, to help with the anxiety, and uncertainty. My family spends more time laughing, than crying, and that’s saying a lot considering the past three years. Seriously. Personally I find it insensitive, that so many want to go places, like my home, where supplies and medical personnel are limited, spreading possible germs everywhere. I have four family members, in my Alaska family, working in hospitals, and oncology clinics. Believe me, they are taking this as seriously as you get. They have ZERO travel plans, and no longer have vacation time either. They expect to be very busy in the coming days and weeks. Our daughter is a buyer for a main hospital here, and her world has turned upside down.I prefer a financial hit, and no vacation for now, to this crap spreading everywhere in my state, and killing people. There I said it. And believe me, that will be one of the few times you will see me saying what I wish everyone would do......”Stay home, and flatten the curve, no matter your age and lack of worry for yourself”. I will not fight with anyone about their choices, on this travel forum or in my REAL life. DebP.S. I’m bummed our son plans to go to Portland, in two weeks, for leisure fun. All I asked him was, “Are you prepared for the possibility you will be stuck?”. Because I’m his mom, I said I hope he is also financially prepared for his choices. He has no worries. He is young."
"Personally, I feel that if every cruise ship and every airline stopped travel to Alaska this spring and summer their economy would be CRIPPLED. Every hotel, restaurant, tour company, store, gas station etc will be in SERIOUS financial trouble. Alaska relies on a tourist business. So if everyone just stayed home the financial fallout would be devastating. People do have to act responsibly and if you are older, frail, have a compromised immune system then these people need to change all their plans. The rest of us need to take precautions (wash our hands and stay home if we are ill) but remember this is not scarlet fever, polio, the plague....it is the FLU! Panic is not the way to handle this or we will all be in the midst of a world wide recession and watch our investments evaporate before our eyes. There seems to be two extremes- those in panic mode and those who believe it is a hoax...the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Just my own personal opinion."
Looks like the decision has been made for us....Canada has just shut down all Alaska cruises leaving from a Cdn Port (Vancouver) on all ships over 500 passengers until July 1st. Done!! Nothing to think about now.
"I do not think people realize what is going to happen. For those that so not... check out the Forums that are already exp. outbreaks. The avg. age of an Alaskan visitor is around 54 or so. The avg. age of a ""planner"" is older. At that age If you have an IRA etc. you just probably took 10's of thousands in losses. C.D.C. just warned older Americans to avoid unnecessary travel. These older people will NOT be coming..... I just do not see ppl. wanting to take a tour with 150 others.....Throw in you are going to see people quarantined for 14 days if they have any exposure..... Lastly, check out travel stats for the last time this type of thing happened..... Be safe and enjoy life! BoatAk"
May I ask where you have seen where all Vancouver cruises are cancelled till July? I’ve not seen that yet.
https:/…
It has not yet Benn announced that all cruises are canceled - just that Canada won't allow them until July 1. Who knows what will happen. Will the US government suspend the PVSA to allow one way cruises from Seattle to Whittier/Seward without a Canadian stop? Would anyone want to the that cruise if so? Who knows.
"I hadn’t considered the US would relax PVSA as a go around to Canada’s decision. Since this is a world problem I think it would undermine Canada’s efforts to control the spread of the virus, even though the economic impact will be huge to Seattle, Canada and Alaska."
"I cannot see the US suspending the PVSA for this. Seattle delayed the start of the cruise ship season by two weeks, before this announcement by Canada. We here in Seattle are the US “hotspot” for coronavirus cases and while not quite on lockdown, it is close. I don’t think cruise ships would be all that welcome until this is over."
"My mom is from Seattle, and we have lots of family there, too. Their first person accounts to us, are enlightening. My niece is a 25 year Princess employee. Your post is spot on Enzian. Watching the news now. Unsettling. Deb"
"Harleygirl, I hadn't heard that yet. Is the opposite true also? That is, a cruise starting in Seward and ending in Vancouver? I have a group cruise of 30+ people scheduled to go in August. I feel like I should just not bother hoping it will happen, and just tell the line to give everyone their deposit back. Since we have not hit the ""final payment"" due date yet, and the deposits are refundable until that date in April. I only feel bad for some of the people in our group that have already booked airfare... will they get their airfare money back, I don't know. I was just about to book some of our group's air when news of it arriving here started to make me wonder... so there would be no loss if I cancelled now for most of us. At the same time, I hate to cancel if things are back to normal by August. It appears that this virus isn't like the seasonal flu (which you don't hear about many people getting in the summer months)... if warmer weather caused it to disappear, then it wouldn't be an issue in the places like Florida where it is warmer now. I feel like I should just go ahead and cancel. Maybe consider going summer 2021 ? I would just need to get refunds on our payments to Major Marine for Kenai Fjords tour and also from Vrbo for a house booked for our land porion."
"From what i see online Canada's prime minister Juston Trudeau has suspended the Alaska cruise season completely until July 1st so I don't think you will be going at all. I'm in the same position, due to cruise in May. Gutted."
"some semantics here....""Juston Trudeau has suspended the Alaska cruise season""- Trudeau has not cancelled the AK cruise season- Transport Canada (a governmental dept. with legal authority) has banned cruise ships of more than 500 people from using Cdn ports.I'd bet that even without the 'ban' that many cruises would be cancelled due to not traveling by their own decision (same as air flights being cxl'd due to reduced passengers."
"Cancel your cruise! I've worked as a tour guide in Skagway, AK since 1992. There is no economy without cruises. Canada has closed its border with the US. Many of the small businesses which provide services along the Alaska Highway will most likely be closed. Gas will be difficult to get outside of the major towns along the highway: Dawson Creek, Fort St. John, Ft. Nelson, Watson Lake, Nisutlin, Johnson's Crossing and Whitehorse. Meidical facilities are few and far between. Phone service is not available on remote sections of the highway. Be wise, stay home and safe. Alaska will still be there in 2021.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway…"
