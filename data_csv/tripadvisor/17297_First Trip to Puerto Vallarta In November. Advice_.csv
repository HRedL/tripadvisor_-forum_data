"Hello EveryoneI am new to this forum. We have travelled to the D.R. for many years and now desire to try something a bit closer, about half the flight time. We are travelling to Puerto Vallarta in November, staying at the Grand Fiesta Americana.I am looking for any recommends for diving/snorkeling places or excursions. Thanks in advance for any help."
"Take a transit bus to Mismaloya and hire a boat to take you to Los Arcos for snorkeling. If you can group together to have 4 or more people it becomes much more affordable. The rest of the snorkeling places are ""ok"", but not world class. My wife enjoyed Playa la Lancha while I was out catching some waves on a paddle board - not great snorkeling but not terrible either."
"There's not really any good snorkelling in PV. Los Arcos is OK, but there's just a couple different kinds of fish that you see and you can do this in 5 minutes. I would focus on the other things PV has to offer."
Don't miss on PV. Or the Malecon. Hit PV one morning and just walk around. Both sides of the Rio Cuale.
"There are many very good excursions/tours and some do it yourself day trips. It really depends on your interests. You could zip line, ATV, get out on the water for sunset sails, go on a tour by water to nearby beaches and islands, walking food tours...and others, so what kind of tours grab you?"

"We're coming down next week for our first trip. I got on Viator and booked a cooking class. There was also a pirate ship excursion that looked fun but if you're not coming with kids, I would pass on that one.I noticed your name and we have a GSD as well. Best. Dog. Ever!"
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isnt GFA the resort where a lot of people were getting sick?"
"Yes, you are correct Funky."
"We’ve used Vallarta Adventures many times over the years. They offer a number of tours/excursions. Lots of fun and very reliable. While snorkelling conditions are much better on the other coast of Mexico, you’ll still be able to see a little bit on a good day. As others have noted, Los Arcos is a good option. There’s lots to consider and it all depends on what you’re interested in. Have fun!"
"And as Funkynassau mentioned, please be sure to read the recent reviews on the sick epidemic that recently plagued the GFA during the past year. Something to keep in mind."
"They are going in November, the GFA ourbreak was months ago. Hey did you hear there were a bunch of car crash's last week, better not drive any more. Not that I am a fan of AI at all - did it once... but geez it is probably the safest place to eat now that it's over..."
"Check out Old Town ( a.k.a. Zona Romantica ) which has many great restaurants, art galleries and shops. Also Playa Las Muertos. I spent many years at all inclusives in Cuba. After your trip to PV you will want to return and may also want to reconsider the all inclusive resorts. PV is very accessible from SF. If you enjoy your bus ride to MIsmaloya (south) I suggest you go north to discover more. Seeing you are snorklers maybe the beach and all inclusive will be for you. My first trip was last April and I definitely will be returning. Read up about the "" shark tank "" at the PV airport! There is good info on it on this site."
