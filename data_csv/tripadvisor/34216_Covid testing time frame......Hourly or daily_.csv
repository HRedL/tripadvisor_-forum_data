"We arrive Friday and I took the test Tuesday. This is technically 3 days, correct? Or, do they count the hours from testing, to arrival at Anchorage airport? From my understanding reading the declaration language, it appears by testing Tuesday for arrival on Friday, I should be fine with the 72 hour timeframe “PRIOR” to departure. I’m I correct on this?"
"I can just report what we were told as we prepared for our trip to Alaska last month . . . 72 hours from the time of your arrival into Alaska. Which for us . . . Saturday 11:15p arrival meant testing no earlier than Wednesday 11:15p . . . technically.BUT . . . we were also told 72 hours from departure time from HOME to travel TO Alaska. This would have given us nearly a 12 hour leeway for testing to be done as early at Wednesday 12noon.In our case, we were concerned about issues upon arrival, so we tested Thursday 8:15am and HOPED we'd have our results in hand by Saturday noon. (Our testing facility was reporting 24-48 hours for results, but ""that it could take longer"" if they have a backlog of tests or an issue with the lab, etc.)Because it was pushing into Friday evening, with no results, we moved our flights out of Milwaukee to 3pm to buy a few more hours in the morning in case we didn't receive our tests Friday night.Test results did come in at 5:30p . . . almost immediately after changing our initial departing flight from home.All of this said, I would encourage you to contact Alaska for an official position, and be sure you have it in writing with you, in case you need it upon arrival. It seems there has been some local judgement calls made based on reports and feedback out of Alaska. And perhaps even some administrative nuances based on where you arrive. We arrived in Fairbanks."
"Days don't matter, the 72 hour time frame does. You didn't provide the time of your test or the time of your flight: if you test on Tues morning for departure Friday at noon, that would be more than 72 hours. Be sure the correct time of your test is given on your results--I read one person who said results were batched together with a morning time noted, though she'd taken the test in the afternoon.Scroll to the bottom here to find Mandate 10: https://covid19.alaska.gov/travelers/""The traveler produces a molecular-based test for SARS-CoV2 result showing a negative result for COVID-19 from a test taken within 72 hours before departure to Alaska"" Further clarification: https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/ (from What are my choices, about half-way down the page):""1. Pre-Travel Test: If you choose the “pre-travel test” option, you do not need results within the 72 hours (or 5 days), you just need to have been tested in that window. If you don’t have results when you land, you will need to quarantine until you receive your results and email them to traveler@alaska.gov or fax them to (907) 269-7952.a. Tested within 72 hours of departure: provide your negative test results and minimize interactions until you receive a second negative test within 7-14 days of arrival.If you don’t have your results yet, you will have to quarantine until you receive them."
- “Technically” 3 days is 72 hours (as there’s 24 hours in a day).- 12:01am Tuesday to 11:59 pm Friday is actually 2 minutes short of 4 days; which is nearly 96 hours. Using your Tue-Fri logic would not be reasonable here.- so.... the winner is 72 hrs.
"I am in the same situation as you are! I tried emailing the contact listed on CDC website and received an automated reply with a phone number to contact. I left a message over five days ago and have yet to hear back from them. We tested today at 5pm (August 4th) and depart at 7pm (August 7th). From what I read it is from departure time so technically we are at 74 hours. We decided the risk of waiting to test August 5th in the morning was too tight with turn around times. My friends just came back from Alaska, were not tested prior to arrival and had no problems getting tested at airport and did not have to quarantine. So who knows! Good luck to you!"
"Deb G, unless your friends got the results back before they left the airport, they broke the law.Edited: 10:39 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"“My friends just came back from Alaska, were not tested prior to arrival and had no problems getting tested at airport and did not have to quarantine.”- there’s zero chance they received results instantly- thus they were required to quarantine- they broke the law"

"There's also a lot of ""sheep"" on this forum that talk big about their constitutional rights being broken but do nothing about it. I am so tired of the political BS being thrown around on this forum. I'm a twice yearly visitor to Alaska, so I don't use this forum for advice of my trips; I used to enjoy reading everyone's questions and reports, but too many have turned this into what most other social media has become - us vs. them."
"Hey Scott. Thank you for your input, and thank you for contributing to other Alaska posts, as I have seen you replying frequently. I tested yesterday (Tuesday) at 3 PM. We depart at 11:00 AM Friday. According to the language on the declaration from, it states “Provide a negative test PRIOR to departure.” So, this is technically, 68 hours. However, we arrive at 6:30 PM Alaska time. So, if the personnel at the airport are counting hours, then I would surpass 72 hour timeframe. But, in referencing the language on the declaration form, my belief is the work “Prior” to departure, allows for counting days instead of counting hours. This is just my observation. Hence, the reasoning for my initial question. Scott, your opinion on my further explanation? I received my Negative test results this morning by the way. Thanks again for your input."
"""I tested yesterday (Tuesday) at 3 PM. We depart at 11:00 AM Friday.""Then assuming your result is negative, you're fine. Arrival time does not matter, departure time does. Read the information from the government sites I gave you in post #2.The Declaration Form says ""I was tested within 72 hours prior to departure and it was negative."" It also has an option if those test results aren't back yet (quarantine until they are: https://covid19.alaska.gov/wp-content/upload… ).""my belief is the work “Prior” to departure, allows for counting days instead of counting hours.""I don't know where you get that belief when all information specifically states 72 HOURS."
