"Hello, Has anyone recently visited Sayulita? I will be heading there at the end of June and after reading some comments online I became concerned with ocean water quality there. The last thing anyone wants on their vacation is to become sick and get a nasty skin infection. Please give your genuine comment if you recently visited Sayulita."
I have a friend who is actually there right now and I am very eager to hear his report when he gets back- I think he gets back this weekend. I will report back. (I am looking at Playa Escondida this fall for a girlfriends' getaway.)
Thanks for your reply. Please let me know about your friend’s experience and have fun on your vacation !
I will and I will!
"We lived in Sayulita for 2 1/2 years and talk regularly to people who live there all year round, people who surf there daily. Do not be put off by the negative press, it’s an amazing place to visit, with amazing people."
"Playa E is a great choice. The later in the fall the better. We usually go in November. Good weather, no rain, but everything is green from the recent rainy season."
"bermurray-0 that is my favourite time to visit this coast too (although usually to Zihua)- because of the lush, green surroundings and the relative low numbers of tourists compared to later on in the season, and perfect temps. :)"
"Our family just got home yesterday! We attended a wedding there with 65+ people. Only heard of one short lived sickness. Some of the family surfed, swam and boogie boarded at the beach. All okay - no rashes or sicknesses. We ate out a lot and had many drinks with ice. Truly is a wonderful little town! Go and have fun!!"
"My husband and 2 of my kids were in Sayulita May 6-14. Surfed everyday, ate in all the local spots (including the bus stop-my husband's favorite.) No issues. They had a great time."
Hi! My family just got back from a week in Sayulita. We visit Sayulita about four times a year and the ocean water was just about as clear and clean as I've ever seen in. My brother and I surfed everyday and we had no problems at all.Here is what our trip looked like! Have fun!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAwbevVJy9s
"It's wonderful that people are posting about their great vacations in Sayulita. And Claire M, thanks for the wonderful video. It really shows what Sayulita is all about."
"You will love Playa Escondida! Great spot for girls weekend-just keep in mind that it is not ""in town"" - a little hike during the day will get you into town and taxi by night!"
"Yes, it does look beautiful! I said I would come back and report on my friends trip he and his girlfriend spent 10 days in Sayulita recently. They said they had a great time. Still lots of people in town, but probably nothing like high season. Neither one of them got sick at all!"
"Hi, I was in Sayulita from May 26 to June 2. I haven't been there in 2 years because of the water quality issues. I was pleased to see that they filled in the river mouth (which was part of the issue with e coli levels). I surfed there 3 days (with a few minor cuts on my feet) without any infections or any gastrointestinal distress. I rented an apt and made a grocery stop en route to town so almost all of my meals were at home. Like most latin countries, Mexico doesn't have the militant food safety regulations found in the US so common sense things like avoiding ice in drinks or using salsa and sauces that are not refrigerated should be practiced - particularly if you haven't traveled often and frequently in the region. I think most of the issues reported are most likely due to the food than the water. Also, June is the low season so less inhabitants generally bodes well for the quality of the water BUT worse for restaurants will lower turnover."
I am planning a trip to Sayulita in 2 weeks but am considering cancelling which will cost me dearly in plane and hotel fees. But I am concerned about the Level 3 Travel Warning and water quality. Are these concerns warranted? all the posts seem positive.
"Gail, I think the travel warning was referring to Cancun and the sad events that have happened there recently. Sayulita is a very safe destination. Also, please read the recent posts above about visitors who have visited, enjoyed, and will return. September is an unusual and wonderful time to be in Sayulita. It's very hot and humid, and many restaurants are closed but the great Mexican restaurants, taco stands and locherias, are open. Don't cancel your Sayulita vacation. You'll be fine."
Thanks Harry!
"Yes, I live in Sayulita and the water is not good. We have friends visiting and they cannot surf because of the raw sewage. My daughters are on the SUP team and they are dry land training because of the problem. There is also a sickness problem that no one can explain. I would not recommend a visit at this time."
"My husband and I were in Sayulita March 24-30, 2019. 4/4 of us got violently ill from Norovirus. My husband and I are both physicians and took every precaution to not get sick. Sayulita pumps their sewage into the ocean of the public beach the bacteria ppm is 180. The US closes the beach when the bacteria is 35ppm. DO NOT GO TO SAYULITA. You will definitely get sick."
"There are a number of recent updates on the Wildmex blog, so I thought it might be worthwhile to post again:https:/…"
"Read the other forums there has been a noro virus type epidemic runnig for a number of years, with authorities more interestedin covering up than fixing."
