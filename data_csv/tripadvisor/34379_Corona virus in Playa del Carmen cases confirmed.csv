"I am booked for a 2 week holiday at Valentin Imperial Riveria Maya for end of March. As of today’s date 2 cases of the Coronavirus are confirmed. Are March break travelers to Cancun area concerned. As a senior Traveler, both my adult children think I should cancel trip (I bought cancellation insurance through Sunwing Vacations) kids suggesting Jamaica or DR (as they are not allowing Cruise ships to disembark) but Cozumel is permitting passengers to do so.Edited: 11:46 pm, March 01, 2020 "
Source for your cases please.
What?

Mexico has been added to the list...https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.htmlVarious sources are reporting 2 confirmed cases in Mexico -- none in Quintanan Roo.
"Seems the OP has her ""facts"" a bit confused. As MrB says, Mexico has a couple of confirmed cases but nowhere near this area."
"According to the article I read this morning from ABC News there are two confirmed cases, one in Mexico City and one in the northern state of Sinaloa. Both patients are in isolation, as are 5 members of the first patients family. Neither patient is said to be seriously ill. Those 2 cases are located appox 34 hrs and 20 hrs away from Playa del Carmen. So at least as of today, not sure the topic of this thread should read Corona virus in PDC cases confirmed, as that will certainly alarm people, and more importantly it is not accurate. Just a thought."
How many people you need to tell you to go?GO!!
To OP:Why title your post the way you did? It states a fact that you fail to support with evidence.It needs to be amended.
Did they fly in to their destinations and where did the plane go from there?
"BeachDog - I guess that's a question for the airlines to track. The ABC News article stated that the men had traveled to the northern Italian region where there has been an outbreak and had returned to Mexico between last Friday and Saturday. One is in isolation at a hospital, the other isolated in a hotel.Papaw - I agree with you."
That's the point the plane reloaded and went to another destination spreading who knows what.
Not sure why the OP hasn’t taken this down or why it hasn’t been shut down...
Possible case in Playa. Not yet confirmed.https:/…
Someone in another forum said they’ll close the airports at Cancun if this is confirmed case. Does anyone know for sure?
"I was in Akumal in 2009 during the height of the swine flu scare and they did not close the airport to the best of my knowledge, although I did see a couple of airlines including the late Thomas Cook company sent special planes to fly a few groups home."
"I have never seen them close the airport and have heard nothing even hinting at it. You can really read anything here.Only thing would worry me is that if they are confirmed in Playa is that they are in a IMSS government hospital. In talking to IMSS employees I know, they have little or no training in this area."
Toronto (& Ontario) has 8 confirmed cases. So we should shut their borders??Arlene - please provide a news link (trusted)
Trump thinking of border restrictions with US/Mexico:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hea…
What about our porous Canada border?
"We are really concerned now as well, especially considering Trump's comments about considering closing the border (whether they were off the cuff or not, who knows). We are supposed to fly out on 3/10 for a stay in PDC and then return to Miami to see family with an infant as our second leg of the trip, and our concerns are mounting... plane/airport exposure, potential border closing and what that means for our return, any possibility of quarantine in our AI in PDC, what risk we pose to our family on our return second part of the trip, etc. etc. Part of my says the risk is low , the other part of me is worried about any number of things going wrong just for the sake of a vacation (albeit well-earned and expensive). I can only imagine what kind of toll this might take on the tourism industry in Mexico, especially right as spring break time approaches."
"""We are really concerned now as well, especially considering Trump's comments about considering closing the border (whether they were off the cuff or not, who knows).""The border is the land border from California at the Pacific Ocean to southern Texas at the Gulf of Mexico. Illegals enter the US along that stretch of land often bringing diseases with them."
"After all Toronto is perfectly safe. they never let any international tourists or travelers in there so you’re in a bubble and there’s no rest. Really?Unless you’re putting a bear yourself in the basement for the next six months, where are you planning to head from this. I think you either have to decide if you want to continue to live your life or if you’re going into some kind of seclusion. Unless you have an underlying health conditions the truth is this is hardly worthy of the panic"
And someone said they were going to close the airports? someone said they’re going to ban all travel? Someone said it’s a conspiracy put together by the Democrats?These are the same people think the Holocaust was a fake and that the man on the moon we’re actually in Nevada. Try to go to reliable news sourceS (Which by the way apparently does not include the President of the United States)
"Last time Trump threatened to close the south border, everyone was worried about airlinesNOT"
"Bonjour, nous sommes à Cancun présentement et tout est normal comme l année dernière. Il y a un peu moins de gens j imagine que les gens voyagent moins cette année. Pas de coronavirus alentour de nous. Ça fait un mois que nous sommes à Cancun. On s en va à Playa Del Carmen pour le prochain mois...On se lave les mains très souvent comme l OM S le recommande on ne se touche pas le nez les yeux et la bouche et on ne va pas où il y a foule. On se tient à 1 mètre de toutes autres personnes. Et a date, rien du tout tout est normal autant à la plage que dans les centres d achat, les musées etc"
"Serbasa - good to hear. Enjoy the rest of your vacation.Link to article dated March 2 below from Riviera Maya News. ""Cancun, Riviera Maya remain corona virus-free"". https:/…2020.htmlAgain, I think it would be much appreciated if the subject line of this thread could be revised if possible so inaccurate information or false alarms don't continue to be spread on this forum. Everyone is concerned, but we all want to base our comments either on personal experience or confirmed facts. Correct?"
"there were two possible cases, but they both tested negative for the coronavirus. i just looked that up as our family is going to this area in about 10 days. my 76yo mom is also going with us. there's more hype about this than need be. just be careful (wash your hands, don't touch your face, etc) and i think you'll be fine.Edited: 8:43 am, March 11, 2020 "
"""I think it would be much appreciated if the subject line of this thread could be revised if possible so inaccurate information or false alarms don't continue to be spread on this forum."" I agree but since it cannot be revised, would be best if the OP closed the thread. I am sure it was well intended at the time but now , no problems."
"I been kicking all over for reports in to the matter and I can't fi d anything to support the claim.We have to be cautious on how and where we get information, there are lots of people around the region that like to Gossip big time is literally a custom and the can go as far as actually swear on their kids about something that it not truth. Try to always verify your sources don't matter where you live."
Arlene (the OP) will have to be the one to DELETE this post
I am boggled at how/why this post hasn’t been killed.
Anyone who considers the OP inappropriate can report it.It would also help to stop adding new comments which keep bumping it up the list.
"And I will bump it up just as you did, MrB. I did contact TA and so far they contend that the OP is free to post this topic according to TA rules. I asked them again to review."
"Yeah, I somehow knew you'd make a snide remark about my constructive post yet ignore the 5 previous (including ANOTHER one of yours!) that that contribute to keeping this thread going. And I know you'll you'll continue as you usually do. It won't get buried unless you STOP!!!!"
At this time I would not stay in a crowded AI!
"Good lord- why should the thread be deleted?Traveling for pleasure is not a necessity, people! Someone wrote this on the PV forum and personally I totally agree.""Think it’s time to face facts, put social responsibility over everything else, and stay in our respective locations until this virus is under control.""I'm not worried about getting it myself, as I am relatively young and healthy. It's not about me though. It's about containing the spread. And face it- wanting to go and lay on a beach and snorkel and drink XXs is NOT a crucial thing people have to do at the expense of other people in your own communities. You think it's ok because Mexico has hardly any cases at the moment? Ask an Italian how fast things change in a week or two. Sheesh."
"Agree, Rissask. I really only believe the topic is sensational and misleading. But the problem is that cannot be changed, as far as I know. But you make many good points."
This makes sense. I think it’s responsible to take whatever precautions necessary to help slow the spreading. That’s the point of it. The point of all the drama that’s going on. It’s precautionary and it’s something that may or may not work but ultimately could help. I cancelled this morning unfortunately.
"Update...So far, only 12 confirmed cases in the entire country.No deaths, 4 recovered, 49 suspected cases.No confirmed cases reported so far in the state of Quintana Roo."
"How many tests are being done in Mexico? Some countries are doing thousands a day, and yes, their numbers are higher."
"A week ago there were no cases in Costa Rica....then one, then 13, then 22....in a week there will be 150....that is how it works. In Jamaica where we just returned from last weekend, there was zero cases, then 1, now three....google 'exponential growth', lol"
"I must try one more time to convey the real danger with Covid-19 transmission.- It has nothing to do with the number of identified cases in Mexico.- It has EVERYTHING to do with the crowds in the international airports, in the planes themselves (miniature cruise ships, breathing everyone elses' ailments, trusting that the airlines are actually disinfecting all the surfaces...), the crowds in baggage claim, the crowds in customs, .... crowds in general, from who knows where ...- Maybe you will contract a dose and hopefully recover beautifully ... but how many people will you transmit it to that may not be as robust as you, that WON'T recover as beautifully.....This Is Going To Get Worse. I'm not crying Wolf; I'm reflecting the views of the vast majority of non-political medical authorities.Reschedule your trip until this clears up."
The 2 cases were found not to be the corona virus. As of now there has been no cases of the virus in the state.
I have no qualms with the topic - it’s the title that needed to go long ago.
"Some Provinces in Canada have Just advised against Any travel anyplace outside of Canada.B C even going over the border to Washington state.If you go, you must go into home Insulation for 2 weeks on return.Not good for Families for spring break!"
"""How many tests are being done in Mexico?"" That is a good question. And think it will be impossible to get a straight answer form the Government here."
"""Good lord- why should the thread be deleted?""Because the title is wrong and may cause people unable to see through the media driven hysteria to needlessly cancel a trip."
"To CoPilot:If you think I'm just blowing smoke, bring me proof of the dangers I have cited and that my assertions are wrong. And I don't mean a recycling of political garbage, give me proof, confirmed by authoritative medical sources.You know what assertions to which I refer. If not, do a little research.Edited: 9:07 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"And I don't expect to hear a believable response.(This is me, trying to be civil)Edited: 9:25 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"WorldTraveler, your question is undefined/unclear.Keep spewing your ""we are all gong to die"" mantra and I will continue to advise people not to fall prey to the media driven hysteria."
False
Are you positive .... where did you read that
"With tourists visiting resorts from places where there are confirmed cases, It’s likely covid-19 is present. Cancel trips. If you go quarantine yourself on return home (if your government hasn’t told to you already). We owe it to the most vulnerable members of our communities and our health care workers to slow the spread..When they cancel hockey in Canada you know it’s for real."
"All valid issues, there is no disputing the apprehension that everyone is facing now or the seriousness of the global situation and the importance of keeping everyone safe and healthy. The main concern with this thread, as many have previously expressed, and that some of our Destination Experts have confirmed, is that this subject line is inaccurate as of this writing. According to more reliable sources and as far as we know at this time, there were never nor are there currently, any confirmed cases in Playa del Carmen or even in Quintana Roo. Granted that could change in 5 minutes, but it is disappointing that Arlene S would post false information and then not be willing to revise/delete it for the benefit of fellow TA members. Although I'm sure we are all wise enough to know that there are more reliable sources for important medical information than one persons careless subject line."
"On Friday, SESA confirmed the first positive case of coronavirus in Quintana Roo...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…"
2 in quanteroo
0 in Playa del Carmine1 in Cancun
They are not allowing cruise ships to dock. bad info
One of the main reasons for the lack of positive case is a relative lack of testing. Absence of proof is not proof of absence.
"According to John Hopkins covid19 tracking there are 82 confirmed cases in Mexico. It doesn’t specify exact locations. You can bet there are more undiagnosed cases. For those who are still considering travel, the time to get out of denial is now. Stay home."
This thread has updates about more confirmed cases in QR...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…
"Travel is the easiest way to catch the virus,whether it is an area with or without confirmed cases of coronavirus .airports ,airplanes,buses ,taxis are the best way to spread it from one city to another"
"March 19, 2020 As of 6pm, Quintana Roo is reporting that they have tested 6 positive for COVID-19. Here is a link to Quintana Roo government reporting:https:/…nuevo-coronavirus-covid-19Edited: 9:09 am, March 20, 2020 "
"Things change very quickly as more testing is done.As of 6pm March 20, 2020 Quintana Roo government is reporting 11 confirmed COVID-19 infections. Please be safe.https:/…nuevo-coronavirus-covid-19"
"I would definitely recommend you cancel or rebook your trip for a later date. This is a pandemic and a very serious problem. The state department has issued the following order: Level four do not travel advisory, “advises US Citzens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of co-vid 19.” I would recommend that you reschedule your trip for a later date."
I just re-read your post. I received an email from Couples in Jamaica stating that they were closing their resorts for March. If you haven’t bought insurance you can go to insure my trip.com and see if you can still purchase it
