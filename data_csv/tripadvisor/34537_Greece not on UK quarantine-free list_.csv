Just heard this on BBC news.Tit-for-tat from UK Government or trying to force Greece hand?Either way it poses more questions than answers to our holiday planned for 26th July.
It is probably because Greece are not allowing direct travel from the UK and some other countries until the 15th of July when they make the decision to lift or extend the ban. It will depend on how the UK is going on with Covid 19.
I didn't think the full list was being revealed until later today?
"It’s just a waiting game now, we are due to fly 4 weeks today 31st July and can’t look forward to anything. We are flying from Glasgow but Nicola sturgeon seems to be trying to stop this :( Praying it all goes ok for everyone and we all have a well deserved holiday."
"Don't think the full list has been revealed yet, but Greece was mentioned specifically on BBC news. Checked their online news feed and it said Greece wouldnt be added to the Amber list as they won't make a decision on UK visitors until mid July. Amber list seems to be a reciprocal agreement with the likes of France, Spain and Germany."
"#3Agree, its just a waiting game. We're in a similar situation to you. Flying out of Bristol but live in south Wales and the Welsh government have different rules."
It’s frustrating ain’t it? When are you due to fly Phil?
"#6 26th July. Still 3 weeks yet, a lot can change in that time, its just the uncertainty"
">>> I didn't think the full list was being revealed until later today?<<<=====^^+1^^The full list is not published until this afternoon, informed sources are saying there are between 75 an 100 countries on the list.Whilst the 'amber' list is supposedly countries with reciprocal agreement in place I suspect there will other factors as well given the number involved. Countries determined as 'green' are those with very low infection rates, but does necessarily have a reciprocal agreement in place such as Australia and NZ. The HMG will lift the travel advisories for these countries, but you are very unlikely to be allowed to enter due to their restrictions.The basis of the list is the 14 day rolling average of infection published by ECDC, they will of course include other factors too. Scroll about halfway down the page and you will get a feel for how the Government will classify countries.https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-d…"
"Fingers crossed for you Phil, and your right 3 weeks is still a little while away. Our cases are all packed for us ready to go we just need to get the go ahead"
"I meant to add it not beyond wit that Greece could be classified as 'green', travel advisory lifted but entry not allowed yet. All will be revealed in a few hours."
"Exactly should be Green, the government here is using the ECDC map colours to guide them, they are listed as included on the Telegraph list. Think it's just political you let us in in 15th July and we will put you on our green list, but it doesn't help us until we know."
>>Think it's just political you let us in in 15th July and we will put you on our green list<<It's a shame political games are played using a pandemic and tourist travel.
">>> Think it's just political you let us in in 15th July and we will put you on our green list <<<=====*If* Greece is classified as 'green' it definitely not political as the HMG has deemed it safe to travel. NZ and Aus are almost certainly to be classified as 'green' but realistically you can't travel - that is not political and it would be the same for Greece, it just puts the ball in the Greek government's court.If Greece is deemed 'red' (unlikely) or not classified (possible) there maybe an argument that its political.Edited: 6:11 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Only 5 countries were mentioned on the news this morning. That was Italy, Spain, France and Germany from the amber list and New Zealand from the green list. That leaves approximately 45 other countries not named. Why speculate, wait until we have the facts."
"The problem seems to be either poor briefing of the media, or indecisive government. Here is the official UK government list:https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridorsAnd yes. Greece is on the approved list, all that is needed now is for Greece to allow direct flights from the UK. If you make your own way via somewhere else on Greece's approved list, then you are allowed to enter.Edited: 11:17 am, July 03, 2020 "
It’s now on the list! What a Government U turn!
>>>It’s now on the list! What a Government U turn!<<<=======Not so much a U-turn as a farce and one which characterises the UK Governments whole handling of the Pandemic.History will be a cruel mistress to this Government.An interesting read on the whole debacle.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/ju…
">>> Why speculate, wait until we have the facts.<<<======Because its the nature of internet fora. As it turned out it was largely correct."
@Nicksy +1It is also a shame to worry only about vacation and not at all about the health of the locals. I hope that the Greek government will not turn out to be as stupid as some.
