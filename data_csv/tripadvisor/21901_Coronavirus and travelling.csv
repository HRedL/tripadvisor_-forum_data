"Hello everyone, My husband and I have a holiday booked for the end of March to Hurghada, Egypt. We’re planning to stay there for a week, but were also planning on taking a day trip to Cairo during our trip. With all this Coronavirus virus stuff I’m a bit worried about travelling now, especially seeing as there is a case of Coronavirus confirmed in Egypt (1st in Africa). I’m not sure what to do and am a little freaked out. What does everyone suggest? Would you cancel your holiday? Thanks in advance"
But the Uk has 9.So it looks like you will be safer in Egypt ;-)Just cancel your day trip to Cairo and go to Luxor. Way more to see there.
"I'm here now and it's fine.Booked another 2 weeks in fact.(If 1 case of a virus freaks you out, I really suggest you stay at home and bolt the door)70,000,000 people live here, so 1 case is well, nothing.Edited: 2:53 pm, February 18, 2020 "
It is 100.000.000 now. That was announced last week.
True! Thanks everyone I can just be a worry wort at times x
Luxor is much nicer- only a 4 hour bus trip across the dessert and some fabulous temples. I would give Cairo a miss unless you are desperate to see the pyramids. Karnak temple at Luxor is worth the trip.
I completely understand your concern. We have a 10 day trip planned starting March 10. I have not decided if I will cancel or try to reschedule or what. But at home I am not in tourist sites and airports surrounded by people from all over the world. That’s what I am concerned about. I also dont want to be sick or quarantined away from home and family. We shall see. But it is not a silly concern
"hello shonef2 , have you decided to cancel your trip to egypt ?my first ever trip to egypt is booked towards the end of april , so everyday im monitoring the news about the latest coronavirus updates"
"Hey everyone, Have you both decided whether you’ll be going or not? I totally understand your concern about being in contact with sick people at the airport and in the actual country whilst out and about. I contacted the company we booked with as well as our travel insurance provider and they’ve said travel is going on as normal, if we cancel we will basically lose over 1k. We decided on the weekend that at the moment there’s only one confirmed case in Egypt and that person has been tested negative now. Who knows what will happen by the summer, there will defiantly be more cases - it’ll get worse before it gets better so might as well just stick to the plans we have"
"I fly back this afternoon. To be honest, I'm more worried about it in the UK than over here."
"We're scheduled for a week in Egypt in late May. The virus is spreading, and I'm more concerned about the connecting flights."
"travelling-couple786 ,im still undecided on whether or not i will go to egyptin april im supposed to fly from LAX to dubai international airport , then from dubai fly to cairo international airportone family member advised me not to go , by not going i would lose $1700 (air/hotel) another family member told me i should absolutely go unless the CDC adds egypt to the list of countries to avoid such as china southkorea italyEdited: 12:25 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"We are thinking of booking one week from 9th March and not Too worried about the corona virus in Egypt as there are more cases in UK. More concerned about contracting it on flights or airports but what about the air cabin crews? Never been to Hurgahada but looks lovely and we just want some sunshine and relaxation for a week, so hope it’s sunny and sea warm enough?"
"Hmmm I booked for Oct for 10 day trip Cairo/Luxor/abu Simbel/Aswan/Cairo. Right now 2 cases in FL, so with 1 in Egypt, way ahead. However, buying travel insurance , just in case."
"the news website france24 has reported a second confirmed coronavirus case in egyptalso , i kept reading news from france24 and the louvre museum in paris has closed because of fears the coronavirus will spread , it didn't say when the museum would reopen https://www.france24.com/en/20200302-egypt-d…"
"I’m no more worried about Egypt than anywhere else. But for now I’m not booking anything where I couldnt get virtually all my money back if the trip or any crucial part thereof was cancelled on me by a third party. That includes hotels where a relevant flight gets cancelled, onward flights if a first flight is cancelled, and any variant. As always insurance for medical costs abroad is one hundred percent essential."
"think we’re definitely just going to go, stock up on a lot of alcohol gel and wipes lol. Just keep an eye out on travel so see what the latest is - they might start cancelling flights, I know now easyJet have started to cancel flights to Germany and France. Yep insurance is a must but you’re still not covered on the insurance if you change your mind, they will only pay out the reason you cannot go ahead is out of your control eg in the case of a pandemic etc."
"Glad that you have made up your mind travelling-couple786 and that nothing gets cancelled, have a great time."
Thank you!
"Just returned having travelled through Hurghada en route to Aswan. It is fine - just stay clean and wash your hands regularly as you would anyway in Egypt. They did a check at the airport 4 days ago and all was declared clear. You are more likely to get an e-coli related infection than Coronavirus in Egypt at this time, so stick to bottled water (even when cleaning your teeth)."
"Just got back.No screening at HRG departures and no screening at LGW arrivals.Was more concerned catching something on the Southern train from LGW. It was FILTHY.Edited: 11:53 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Hi everyone,My Husband & I planned our trip for two weeks in mid April for Jordan and Egypt. Even though it's risky in NYC, I am not sure if we should travel at that time. We both want to go but families have been asking us not to go. We have been planning this trip for so long and not sure when to postpone if we don't go now!Please advise,Thank you,Rakhi"
"Also I think they’ve opened the Louvre now, I know someone who is there at the moment and they’ve said everything is normal."
"Possibly the biggest risk is the flights to/from Egypt. 9 tourists that left Egypt (7 French, a Canadian and a Taiwanese) have tested positive. Egypt is probably hiding the true numbers and is playing games as the health ministry says that only people who spent 14 days in Egypt and then are diagnosed within 48 ours of departure will be counted so they won't count those 9. Plus the unofficial word is that there are over 20 cases in Egypt. We will be back in Egypt in 5 days and have packed plenty of N95 masks etc just in case Egypt explodes like Iran and Italy did as they went from virtually nothing to thousands of cases in under 2 weeks.Still nowhere is fully safe as my worksite here in Sydney had a worker return from Iran on Monday and ignored the mandatory 14 day quarantine and went straight to work, he was kicked off site but not before possibly contaminating others."
I take twice a day public transport (tram and train) between Antwerpen and Brussel to go to work.I work in a building that is open to public. I really think the chance I get it here is much bigger then I would come ill there
"I'm having the same questions regarding my husband and my's trip on March 19 to Egypt. We are spending 9 days there, including a 3-day boat ride on the Nile but there was just news that 12 workers on a boat have tested positive for the virus. It's not the same boat, but still worrisome. However, we also live in NYC and could get it here, as well. Not sure what to do. This is an anniversary/graduation gift to ourselves we've planned for a year."
"Hey everyone, So bit of an update, we’ve decided not to travel anymore. This may be a bit dramatic to some but the cases seem to be going up dramatically by the day here in the UK. 2 BA luggage handlers have tested positive in one of the main airports in the UK - which worries us more about contracting something whilst travelling in airports not knowing where people have been etc. We’re going to keep an eye out to see if travel advice changes in the next 2 weeks, and then contact travel insurance provider to see what they say. I’ll also contact the company we booked the holiday with to see what they can offer, worst case scenario we will lose out but at least at home I know where I’m going, who I’m in contact with etc. Probably more likely to get it here but at least you’re in familiar surroundings and can take precautions as appropriate in your own home rather than be stranded abroad somewhere and have to isolate putting more family and friends at risk once back. Horrible situation but fingers crossed financially we get something. I would personally not go and stay in your familiar surroundings. Maybe contact the company you booked with to see what your option are and whether you can rebook for another day. Hope that helps x"
"travelling-couple786, sorry you cancelled but you have made the right decision for you. I hope you can change the dates of your travel so you don't lose too much money.At this stage, I'm still going if the Goverment lets me lolEdited: 8:07 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"travelling-couple786 , my trip to cairo is not until the end of april , but mostly likely i will not be going , in august of 2019 i booked my flight with emirates airlines and made a reservation at cleopatra hotel , i was so excited about visiting cairo , but now my excitement has turned into disappointment my only alternative is to contact emirates and see if they will let me change my flight to sometime next year and what kind of rebooking fees they would charge meif anyone still decides to go to egypt please keep us posted on what kind of procedures and precautions they are taking at airports , thank you !"
I’ll be there in 3 days and will be taking a Nile cruise in about 10 days and should be back to Australia at the end of the month. By then I’m guessing the pandemic will be ramping up and hopefully the airlines will still be flying but probably many flights will be cancelled.
Just found out 9 more cases of corona virus caught in Egypt with 3 from Maryland and 6 from Texas infected on the same cruise. There are also 21 Greeks infected who visited both Israel and Egypt so probably infected in one and infecting others in the other. At this rate they might have big numbers within weeks
"There is virtually no difference between traveling to Hurghada (per the OP) or Cairo...flights coming and going from the hotspots of the world such as Northern Italy??? Cruises... it is pretty much common knowledge they are a higher risk...right now travel anywhere is a bigger risk than it was at this time last year...either wait it out or go but don't think avoiding Cairo is going to help.Edited: 9:03 am, March 07, 2020 "
@32 these cases are being found and tested for after they return home...when Egypt finally starts doing some serious testing their numbers will be up...probably by many hundreds...if you don't test you have no cases to report. They will have to now with the media reports.
My GF and I have a trip in early april ( leaving april first) we have no plans to cancel the trip. We are more concerned with travel delays than the virus itself.
"Looks like the number infected in Egypt has passed 100. 45 on the boat plus more than that have left Egypt ( 2 in Florida, 3 in Maryland, 8 in Texas, 1 in Canada, 11 in a French town, 1 in Taiwan, possibly the 21 in Greece, possibly another 7 in France). Then there are possibly as many again who were infected in the 500 or so people who have been on the boat since the initial infections 3 weeks ago.Have to also wonder about how many other boats may have been infected as the boats can dock 3 deep with passengers and crew accessing the dock through other boats.Also no reports of testing the thousands of people who came in contact with the infected in places such as crowded tombs, museums, coaches etc.Almost certain that most visitors to Egypt will soon be subject to quarantine when they go home and already Florida has announced anyone returning from Egypt will need to quarantine themselves for 14 days."
Sadly I have to agree with you. It's the lack of testing which is the key. No test = no case proved. Time will tell but I have a gut feeling that all is not what it seems at present. I do hope I am proved wrong.
Every country is as guilty. I flew back to LGW last week and they were more interested in my DF allowance than temperature.
"We are in the same place, the foreign office has not advised us no to travel ...yet. I was ready to cancel at a financial loss but now with 10 days to go we are in a watch and wait situation too?Optimistically we may bite the bullet and just go, hand wash etc Cairo 1st then cruise on Nile then Luxor for 3 days.Fingers crossed for us all and hope we get a great holiday despite fears???Watching the news may make many stay in but travelling on a UK train yest may have put me at risk, you never know who is a carrier?"
"Let me put it this way: with a sunny 25-26 degrees outside and humidity in the low 30%'s you'd be hard pressed to find too many coughing people. I don't have any scientific data on this new coronavirus but you can read the data for the SARS (also a coronavirus) outbreak here https:/… As you can see, with higher temps there was a sharp drop (as in 18 fold!) in daily incidence for SARS. IMO as soon as the temps hit the high 20's (in Celsius) the whole hysteria will be over. In Egypt we are probably talking by a month or so ( earlyApril temps can get up to 28 Celsius even in seaside resorts)"
"With due respect, in that case how would you explain the fact that there are now cases in the Maldives and one island was put into lockdown yesterday? it is much hotter there in March than in Egypt."
80% humidity plus many tourists from the Far East? It's not like the SARS died instantly when the outside temps got over 25 degrees Celsius. Just the number of new cases dropped.
"Wid, Adrian is correct.Its the humidity."
Many visitors from the far east? Not any more there aren't. Italians also banned incidentally.
"My decision was easy (but with big sadness) when I heard the first Nile cruise case. We have cancelled our 3 weeks trip (supposed to start 25 April) yesterday. I am 62 and my husband is 80, there should be no other choice. Cancelling hotels (all refundable) was very easy with booking.com and hotels.com with one click and automatic. Sent email to my Egyptian Travel Agency for our Nile Cruise (already prepaid in full). They used to email me back right away all the time but for this time they are keeping quiet. I have to work on it. For air tickets (Emirates Perth - Cairo return, Egypt Air Cairo - Aswan and Hurghada - Cairo) I will wait for a while to see how things develop, If they cancel themselves I would get full refund. I am scared but at the same time, staying here (Perth Australia) is the safest."
"hirfletYour situation resonates with me as hubbo and myself are very close in ages to you two and just a few days ago decided not to go ahead with our trip to Marsa Alam in 10 days time. Hubbo has a compromised immune system and the inevitable anxiety would have rendered the holiday worthless as regards the relaxed and carefree time we had anticipated. Being a package holiday means that if we cancel we will lose all our money unless the FCO changes its advice or our tour operator takes a flexible attitude to our request to amend or cancel. They are looking at cases on an individual basis so we shall see but we are being philosophical about it. Health comes before cash, whatever happens.I wish you well and hope that you are able to take your long awaited trip as some stage. We spent New Year 1993/4 in Perth incidentally and loved the place.Edited: 9:53 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Adr1anThought you might like this interesting and enlightening NG article about the role of climatic conditions in the spread of sars viruses:https:/…Edited: 10:20 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Sadly we have also postponed our spring trip to November as my immune system is compromised and while I tend to say what will be will be it’s not worth my husband’s stress at the possibility that I could catch something en route.We are lucky that it’s a routine visit for us not the trip of a lifetime, tough choices are being made worldwide these days."
Welcome to the club Catherine. It's not just the catching of the virus that worried us but the probability of its being more serious than in a healthier person if hubbo had indeed become infected. I hope your November trip goes well. We too feel lucky that it wasn't a more expensive holiday in the tropics. I know of someone who has lost a $1000 trip. Think we would have dithered longer and with great difficulty in their shoes.
"#46 - OK, this is the SUN newspaper, but the article is quite good https:/… Basically saying that if you are covered by travel insurance & they were already aware of someones medical condition, you should be covered if your doc will write a note saying not fit to fly."
"Yes but you are missing the point. He IS fit to fly, just at a higher risk. Neither the GP nor the consultant can issue letters in this situation. I have already been down that route."
"Yep health before wealth! Hopefully the FCO change their advice or the airline does In the next couple of weeks. I’m going to contact the package provider and see if they would rearrange to later on in the year at least we won’t be at a financial loss. Good luck everyone! Hope it all works out for everyone and if you do decide to go stay safe, practice good hand hygiene and carry lots of anti bac."
"eLaRefHave just re-read my last post and realise it comes across as a bit bolshy which was unintentional. Apologies and thank you for posting the link..Anyway the situation is that the medics cannot write a letter saying that hubbo is at risk. They say that although this is true, it has to be our decision as to whether or not the risk is too high. We have a copy of the last consultant appointment confirming his condition and medications and a document from the internet which confirms that someone with his condition is more susceptible to infections but that is all we can get. Our tour operator has agreed to look at our case (along with the other 50 million!) and if we get no joy from them, only then can we pursue the insurance route - using the same documents.Hope that has explained things a bit more clearly."
"Latest news is a German tourist has died in Hurgada of the virus. According to reports he went to Egypt a week ago and went to hospital 2 days ago, So he must have been already infected and contagious when he went through the airport and the screening didn't work. Then he was mingling for a few days so you have to wonder how bad the outbreak will be in that resort in a week. Not good."
Testing before boarding and compulsory gelling hands before entering hotel restaurants isn't rocket science.
Gelling hands only goes so far. The passengers on the Nile cruise ship were infected by the crew. It also looks like the virus was in Egypt in January as the Taiwanese government has announced the the woman who Egypt claims brought the infection to Egypt actually caught the infection in Egypt. There were still many Chinese tourists in January so odds are one of them was the original source.
That's quite possible. But if the German tourist from Hurghada is the first person to die of coronavirus in Egypt it means that people aren't exactly dropping like flies...
Yeah. We should be going to Cairo with my gf in 4 days but stressed out because of corona. I wonder what are the chances gettin coronavirus and how bad is it in Cairo.. we fly from Ukraine to Cairo. Go or not go.. hard
"Me and the wife heading out to Marsa Alam end of this month for 30th Birthday. I have been in contact with Tui regarding the virus spread, and waiting on a response - i have also messaged the hotel - think we will be going but will stay in the resort... really fancied trip to Luxor but will do that next time. Do you think be worth wearing masks on the flight?"
"I was going to on the way back, but didn't bother as a mask doesn't stop you catching it.You get tested on arrival at HRG but absurdly, not in the UK before boarding."
We just joined our cruise in Aswan. We are on the Oberoi Zahra. We were met by crew with face masks and gloves and all arrivees were set apart from each other while enjoying a welcome drink and filling out a health and travel questionnaire followed by temperatures being taken. We were told that masks and gloves were available to us if wanted. There is hand sanitizer everywhere you look to be used as needed. After everyone went through the health check the crew removed their masks although some are wearing gloves. When we returned from a tour the driver of the car sprayed our hands with what smelled to be alcohol.Just to give you an idea of what to expect. Unsure what will be ahead of us in order to disembark. We are just hoping everyone will stay well.
"We are due to fly tomorrow.we have 6 weeks through Egypt and Jordan and were then meant to be travelling to Israel for my niece's wedding. Israel has now closed boarders so all is turning South. I have to cancel today if we decide not to go and Emirates will credit flights(3k) We have 4 flights to get to Cairo as my husband has a bad back, otherwise very healthy. What to do!!!! This is top of his bucket list and we self tour so are not with groups. We can pick and choose times to minimise crowds. He is feeling that we will be living on our nerves and not enjoy the trip."
honestly your husband is right and things are getting worse by the day...here in US we have people every day testing positive ...many reporting having been to Egypt. Wait to go when you can fully enjoy and not risk being quarantined on one end of your trip or the other.
"yes, we just cancelled everything. I feel totally gutted! Back to work instead of a 10 week trip :("
hopefully you will make the trip in the future...this is a really bad time to travel.not much stops me but grounded for some months.
There are more cases now of coronavirus in Egypt than from the time of your comment. I understand there are tourist in quarantine aboard on a Nile cruise.
There have been more cases in Egypt since the beginning of March.
Following
"This is the exact reason we have cancelled. I am not concerned about the risk of catching Corona as I work in the health industry so probably have more chance of catching it at work, but the thought of quarantine in Egypt is not my idea of a holiday. We had 12 days in Israel which has already now been closed to tourists, so better just to wait and do it all at a better time :( I am devistated. 6 month of planning and 5K out of pocket. Australia is a long way to travel!!!"
"Im supposed to go on April 9th and ever since everyday is the agony of deciding what to do. I don't want to be stranded on a ship on the Nile with Coronavirus patients if I don't have it. It is a complete nightmare. If I don't go I will probably lose 5K too.Edited: 12:30 am, March 11, 2020 "
"I am trying to cancel my insurance policy,might as well get that 700 back as it doesn't kick into effect until tomorrow!! But I bet they say that it was in effect effective they day you bought it in case of cancellation. I bought it before the whole Corona issues ."
"I understand people's concern and why you would want to cancel. We are in a similar position, trip to jordan, Israel and Egypt coming up at the end of the month. We are travelling from Australia.The politics surrounding this far far worse than the actual epidemic. Frankly there is almost an equal chance of gett i ng the virus here in Melbourne. But if I was to get it...I would also rather be home in self isolation than in Egypt.Thank you for all the updates !"
"I was originally in the same thinking as a lot of folks on here and panicking. But guys, lets put things in perspective here. The UK has four times more cases and already reached almost 400 confirmed cases, whereas Egypt hasn't even gone above 60 cases. The UK has 66 million population and Egypt has over 100 million population. There is more chance of someone being knocked over by a bus than catching the coronavirus. As for worrying about lockdowns, have a look at the threads in this forum - You will find that those travellers whom are already there say that hardly anything has changed and they seem to be enjoying their time. One idea is that those who have holidays booked that are at least a month or more ahead, might be better off trying to rearrange, rather than cancel and lose most, if not all money. But IMHO those of us whom are travelling in the next week or two would be better off still travelling.Either way, I'm still travelling and will be keeping an eye on the news and if things get worse, then I'll simply book a flight back. At least this way I've had a bit of a holiday too, albeit a shorter one."
We go April 10th to...Just keeping an eye on the news...I'm kinda nervous and don't know what to do
"@ Jasim, maybe check with your tour operator as Israel has new travel restrictions, everyone arriving there must be quarantined for two weeks both nationals and foreigners.read this recent threadhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…Edited: 3:50 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"OK after much thought we have just cancelled flights, Cairo hotel and Nile cruise. I got more than 50% back on all (full hotel refund, booking.com).The financial loss is minimal and I will claim on travel insurance.I know we will get new in UK this p.m. re delaying the Virus. UK NHS has only so many ventilators, Egypt care is much less able to manage sick people. I know if we went on trip we would not fully relax for fear of illness. The Egyptians manage things differently to the UK. I am releived now not to be going and now...to unpack my case and cancel the cat care. Back to work in the hospital, which is very busy with contingency plans and many concerns. This virus is just beginning, we will holiday when the coast is clear again.Safe travel for those braver than me!"
Please let me know what you decide and your experience after you come back. Our trip is in mid April.
Please let me know your experience after you come back. Our trip is in mid April
"Hope you have a great trip, I did not panic into cancelling, just looking at facts. If unwell I Egypt the medical services are not as robust as the NHS which is struggling. My concern was being in close proximity to many people. The numbers with the virus and climbing daily. I am not sure Egypt figures are accurate? The cruise ship in quarantine in Luxor bothered me. I know someone on this and it is not nice at all.Keep a close eye on the news and be realistic, this Pandemic is just beginning, it will get worse and lives will be lost. I work in the hospital, some Doctors say why would you go to Egypt, you must be mad. Others say just take the risk and go? Mixed views, I am very happy to have cancelled. I may not be so easy to 'just get a flight home' and it may not be a smooth journey. Less tourists may equal more hassle from Egyptians, I hope things get better for the country soon.Best wishes...."
"@lynda T What grounds will you claim travel insurance on? I was under the impression that most travel insurance providers won’t cover you if you decide not to go. I’m just seen keen to know as I was going to contact my insurance company too in the next coming days. I agree - you don’t know what will happen, their healthcare system is a lot different and the language barrier would be a Massive concern. Also we wouldn’t be able to enjoy our holiday with all this going on and will be filled with anxiety and panic constantly. Best to stay at home in the UK, where if we did get ill and there were deteriorations we have access to one of the best healthcare systems in the world! Stay safe everyone and safe travelling to those of us who are a lot Braver than me x"
"Right decision, we cancelled too. Much safer at home."
"Not sure i will get natwest travel insurance refund for loss. But, i used the age 60 & 73, and gov advise to avoid crowds. I have also had a dry cough? Even if i lose money I am happier to be in UK. Needing isolation or healthcare in Egypt would petrify me. Also starting a cruise greeted by masked men is not relaxing. They would not have kit to test guests or staff so with folk travelling from everywhere there is a significant risk. Keep healthy all! Sunny in UK next week,"
"We are die to fly out on 23rd March, for a 7 night nile cruise, seriously considering not going, particularly after seeing reports of Luxor trips being cancelled and tourists being told to remain in hotels. Not really bothered about catching anything (that could happen just as easily in a supermarket), just don't want to end up being contained in Egypt somewhere."
We have returned from a tour of Jordan and Egypt which included a 4 day cruise on the Oberoi Zahra the beginning of March. 4 fellow travelers from our group have tested positive for CV and two tested negative. The rest of the group is self-isolating for 2 weeks. the tour was great but I suggest you postpone.

It rains in the Maldives but not in Egypt
"Sorry, but it definitely rains in Egypt"
"Of course it rains in Egypt, just rarely in some places and not very often in others."
Been BBQing myself on a scorchio staycation for the past week and just come on here to catch up. Can someone enlighten me as to what on earth rain in the Maldives has to do with the heading of this topic?!
