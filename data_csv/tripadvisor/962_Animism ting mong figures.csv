"It's been quite some time since I have seen animist ting mong figures in rural villages used to ward off evil spirits and evil events, but it looks as if coronavirus has brought them back in to use. For those with any anthropological interests or awareness, or just interested in getting off the usual well trodden tourist trails, this primitive aspects of Cambodian rural village life and this article may be of interest:https:/…Best regards.

Ian I read a similar article on Move to Cambodia a few weeks ago and as I commented I had seen them in Chi Phat about a year ago in one part of the village. I have not been able to visit this April so do not know if they have reappeared https:/…
"Hello Alistaire,I have seen them many times over the years and in many different parts of the country but usually just one or two in any district. However, it would appear that the scourge of coronavirus has seen them reappear in some communes and in some numbers this time.I first recall seeing them in Preah Dak aka Pradak commune about five or six km from Angkor when working with the Greater Angkor Project. But I have also seen them in the north-east and the north-west of Cambodia far more recently.Unfortunately, my annual visit to Cambodia in April this year had to be aborted.Best regards. Ian"
Indeed based on my increase knowledge from the articles then I too would expect that there would be many more now. The thing that had puzzled me when I saw them last year was that I had never seen them before in the village and that they were only outside a dozen or so houses in one small area of the village. Although my friends had given me some explanation the article went a lot further that they had been able tosorry you too could not make it lets just hope we are back soon - I have my fingers crossed for a December visit if I can and another in April
A good topic and Covid-19 related article with good photos of ting mong figures.https:/…Best regards. Ian
