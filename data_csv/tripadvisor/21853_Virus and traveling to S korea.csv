"Hello I have a trip coming In March and due to the virus outbreak, I was wondering if Seoul and Jeju island are safe to travel to this time or I should cancel my travel?"
"Not safe.Two people have been infected. It's very little chance, now. There are more people who don't even try masks on. But, no one knows how it will be in the future.I think you'd better cancel your trip if you're worried."
"Hi, by any chance do you know whether they’ve gone past the airport, or when and how they (the 2 reported cases) were detected? Did they voluntarily have themselves checked? I’ve read about the 2nd case, Korean man who worked in Wuhan, returned to SK and has shown symptoms. But the article didn’t say whether he was able to go home then submit himself to authorities or was intercepted at the airport?"
"I have plan to seoul on end of feb until early march with 3kids,1 infant and my parent 65yo.. should i cancel this trip? I was thinking and wondering, because we will go to tourist area like lotteworld, nami and etc.. please advice.. btw 3 already infected.. so sad :(Edited: 7:21 am, January 26, 2020 "
"Only you can determine your own comfort level. Put things into perspective. In the US, there have been over 8000 deaths due to the flu this season. Makes me wonder why we don't hear of more people asking if they should visit here.Edited: 9:07 am, January 26, 2020 "
"I guess because with flu, there’s already studies about it, especially a vaccine. Ofc, I wouldn’t underestimate it. This nCoV, the virus still remains a question mark. There’s still no absolute cause, transmission (there are posts circulating it can be spread thru the eyes) nor treatment. Doctors have only been managing the symptoms. At the end of the day, it’d be up to us but a local’s perspective would be greatly appreciated as we decide to either push through or postpone the travel."
"I'd just wait it out little bit more. Give it maybe 2 more weeks and see. Regardless, I am sure the airlines will be happy to waive the change/cancellation fees if the issue keeps escalating. That's what I plan on doing as my trip is not going to take place in March as well."
"I think only China has a remarkable infection rate.But, traveling those countries with someone who has weakened immune systems is not advised. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_coronavirus_(2019-nCoV)#/media/File:Outbreak-coronavirus-world-large.pngEdited: 5:51 pm, January 26, 2020 "
I actually cancelledMy trip to China in March and was looking perhaps to go to South Korea instead. I have to be in japan last week of February and wanted to see more of Asia since I’m already familiar with japan.
"I think i will wait and see the update about the virus in S.korea, bcoz i will traveling with kidoz and old man..anyone please update the local situation, and prevention by S.korea goverment..I saw in internet some tourist area in seoul still crowded and they didnt wearing mask.. i dont know how the people in seoul faced this issue.."
I’ll probably cancel our March trip to SK too if numbers continuously go up by Feb. Not sure about the reliability of the article I read but the 3rd confirmed case reportedly arrived on the 20th and was able to engage in his community until the 25th when he started to manifest the symptoms. Hope everyone starts wearing masks as initial findings say that this virus has a long incubation period and anyone can have it before symptoms show up.
"Everything is completely normal here. No panic on the streets, no mask wearning by everyone, everyone is out enjoying their New Year Holiday and time off. Also school is out with kids on vacation, so there's no panic in the mom community haha. We get a text message every few days to wash our hands and be hygenic, but that's it. I wouldn't cancel any trip to Korea just yet IMO."
"Thank michael for your info.. Theres 4 people are infected now, hopefully theres no more.."
I will also wait and see. Fortunately my trip isn't until May and I can see how things progress. In the US there are already 3 confirmed cases plus another 8 being tested.
Is everyone in seoul wearing mask today?how the condition so far? please update..
"Why are you asking again- it's been like a day and no changes. Wait like two weeks when the ""incubation period"" is over - every country might have totally different situation."
"No the airlines won't waive the cancellation fees, nor will travel insurance cover it unless you booked prior to the notification of the outbreak, but one way or the other you will lose some percentage thru cancellation. We asked quite a few travel agents if any bookings have slowed down to Korea and Japan and all have said bookings haven't slowed. I think with the Tokyo Olympics still happening this year there will be some very serious countermeasures in place and research on a vaccine."
"Compare to other affected countries, SK still safe with 4 cases detected and those patient already quarantine promptly. That what i read since i will go to SK this april as well.Edited: 9:51 am, January 30, 2020 "
"already 6 infected, and 1 is first case of human transmissionn.. I saw in korean vlog, most in myeongdong is wearing mask.. why the victims keep on increasing? does the Korean government restrict Chinese tourists?I have to make a decision in 2 weeks at least.. the worst is refund my ticket (70%) and canceled the hotel.Edited: 8:22 pm, January 30, 2020 "
"I think you should relax. If you're this worried, then don't come. But no one is hiding and avoiding life here. Work is normal, nightlife and restaurants are full, everything is still the same. Personally, I would not cancel."
"Annisa U,Instead of checking the progress, I recommend you to cancel ASAP. Cancellation fee will be the price for saving your time and energy.The worst case is to cancel at the end."
"I agree with michael. Government controlled this situation quite good. Some people wearing mask, but nothing different from normal days. Many people in here concerned or cancelled travel to southeast asia rather than stay here.Edited: 11:56 pm, January 30, 2020 "
Hi my trip is 19th feb to busan …and will wait and see the situation too..will appreciate if any friends from Busan will update on any confirm cases there.thanks in advance.will observe the situation for the next couple of weeksas I really looked forward for my trip.
"I absolutely wouldn't want to be on an airplane with sick people. Many sick people on planes. And the person traveling with an infant, three kids, and senior parents... not a good idea.It's not really touring Seoul that is a concern, it's the germs on the plane.Edited: 6:16 am, January 31, 2020 "
"If you can get a NS from anywhere in the States, you're likely fine. I wouldn't worry.I'm on a DFW-ICN flight in the next week. I'm not concerned in the least."
"meh. Germs are EVERYWHERE. Like what the others have said, if you're so worried then cancel your flight / trip. Just don't regret after unless you have a crystal ball."
"Hi Annisa, I understand your concern regarding people wearing masks. But to be blunt, wearing a mask does not stop one from getting the virus. I’m speaking from a lab scientist point of view. Me and my colleagues work with suspected nCov virus on the daily. And we can tell you that masks is not a shield. If you are sick, cough into a tissue and immediately discard. Coughing into the mask can still allow the virus to affect people around you. Likewise, wearing a mask only helps to prevent LARGE droplets. Fine droplets through cough and sneeze can still reach you. Since you are travelling with potentially immunocompromised individuals ie. small children and elderly, i advice not to travel for now. Unless you are willing to wear N95 masks during your travel. Which is more protective than surgical masks but highly uncomfortable. Hope this helps."
"Thank you for the advice and input everyone, until now I will continue my trip to Seoul, of course before leaving we will prepare ammunition such as: bring N95 mask, eat healthy and vitamins so that our immunity is good..and for the kidoz, I will take them to doctor first to have influenza vaccine to provide immunity, although the corona virus is different from influenza ...in my city Jakarta,Indonesia, still no one infected with corona, but masks price is go up, and the stock is limited, hopefully everything will be okay..and stay safe and healthy.."
"Michael, planning on coming to Seoul next week. Is everything still business as usual there? Things are still open? I'm only finding that DMZ tours are cancelled.I don't want to come if I can't do anything Any thoughts would be appreciatedThank you!"
"I have seen a google map which shoes which countries are infected. Sadly, a lot of countries have reported cases of this virus, or at least the countries worth visiting for a vacation.Personally, I wouldn't cancel my trip.Honestly I would be more scared to go to a country which did not report any cases, because either: 1- The country sucks, and does not receive a lot of tourists.2- The country's health care system sucks."
Masks only help those already infected. Don't be silly and give in to thinking otherwise.https:/…
"InConstant, What is NS means?https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
South Korea has 28 cases accding to CDC report
NS = Nonstop flight
"I was supposed to leave on March 3, and already got a visa, but it looks like I will reschedule my flight and postpone it until the end of the year. Yes, of course, I will spend more to reschedule flights, but I love my health more and don't want to take risks about this virus. After feeling fear when returning from Thailand last January, I don't want to feel fear of the virus again. My friend who lives in Seoul also suggested so, it's better to prevent than cure and forbids me to come for the next few months."
"I found this articles, hope will help..https:/…https:/…"
I can't really understand the concern since we now can establish that there isn't any major outbreak of coronavirus in South-Korea. There are 28 cases and the mean incubation time is 3 days. Given the extreme concern around health in East Asia (an I would assume also in South-Korea) I would assume that every Korean with the slightest symptoms would have gone to hospital by now. There are currently 28 cases among 50+ million Koreans. The risk of a traffic accident is much higher than you getting infected.Im leaving for Seoul tomorrow! Germany and France has together almost the same number of inhabitants and of infected as Japan but the commotion and drama is not comparable....
"My flight is from JFK via ICN, a bit nervous to be in ICN airport transiting....SK has 28 cases as of yesterday"
"of the 28, 17 were those returning from a foreign country and 11 were transmissions in Korea. All 11 are family members, etc. who were all already under cdc watch.the virus is basically contained, so it's perfectly safe!Edited: 8:12 am, February 12, 2020 "
"N95 masks are not suitable for children.I have used one of those years ago to clean a pigeon loft and really would not want to walk around with it for hours.France (11 cases) and Germany (16) are far away from China so of course people are less concerned. Germans evacuated fromWuhan are being quarantined (as opposed to Japanese citizens that were flown out).Just bc the number of cases in South Korea is relatively low (under 30) now does not mean it will necessarily stay this way in the next weeks. There are more people with masks outside than normally and people avoid crowds. Cinemas are half empty. A lot of busses have been equipped with hand desinfectants. On the other hand, people just throw away used masks on the street (rubbish bins are rare here) and you can see men spitting.Edited: 12:43 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"Hi, I will be going to seoul too during that time with my kids. I just want to make sure I am not alone in risking everyone...are you cancelling your trip? Thanks"
"Hi Tathoriffic,You are same boat with me..Im going to seoul end this month, with kids also..I'm in group actualy 6adults, 3kids, 1 infant (13months old), and until now I still confidence and will not cancel..My apartement booking is nonrefunable now.. I belive S Korea goverment will take good care about this issue..I think I will not cancel except theres travel warning or travel ban from my country or S. Korea (I hope not)I heard theres temperature checking in subway st now..Bismillah, Insha allah will safe :)Edited: 11:58 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"No one is checking temperature in subway where I am in Gangnam. Maybe in Myeongdong because of the high concentration of Chinese tourists. I haven't heard any news about it, though."
Oh sorry not in subway st. But in korail st. I saw in my friends instagram story..Thx for correction michael
Is SK still allowing tourists from China? I read that SK was advising citizens not to visit Singapore. We have a trip to SK booked for 6 April transiting through Singapore. I'm concerned we may then not be permitted to enter SK because we have been in Singapore? Where can I find out?
"@Fiqiu There is no ""travel ban"", the South Korean goverment just asked it's citizens not to travel there. So far, we can still travel everywhere and so can nationals from those countries. Some budget airlines have started to reduce/cancel flight connections (to Taiwan for instance).@Michelle Yes, Chinese people can travel to and out of South Korea. Nobody can tell you how the situation is going to be in April and whether people transiting from Singapure will face problems. I would get travel insurance if you haven't got it yet. You can find out by checking the media a few days before your trip.There are no general temperature checks on public transport so far. Some soldiers sit around the bus terminal and film everybody coming.Edited: 3:58 am, February 13, 2020 "
"Does SK still permit chinese people to trvael between SK & China?on any regions aside Wuhan/Hubei? If yes, this is disturbing and scary..coz the virus can be asymtomatic..Edited: 8:28 am, February 13, 2020 "
"We have travel insurance but hard to get refunds unless there are bans, can't get a refund just because you don't want to take the risk. So SK has not introduced bans on travel from and to mainland China whilst many other countries have done so and yet they ask their citizens not to go the Singapore. Sounds a bit silly to me."
"also, The Korea Times,SK advised: do not travel to Singapore and Vietnam, wherein fact vietnam has only 15 caese and SK has 28.Edited: 9:28 am, February 13, 2020 "

"Hi MIchelle, according to the Smart Traveller website from the Australian Governement, ""Due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, from 4 February, all foreign nationals who have travelled in China’s Hubei Province in the previous 14 days will be refused entry to the Republic of Korea"".https:/…south-korea-republic-koreaPolly, can you please confirm?I am travelling with my family to SK in mid-April too and we have no plans to cancel unless things get really bad.Edited: 9:59 pm, February 13, 2020 "
"Hi Arrowheadz, are you flying direct to Seoul from Sydney? That would be preferable than flying via Singapore I think. We really don't want to cancel. It is our son's wedding - he is marrying a Korean woman. He is not worried about the virus but he says there is some concern in the general public evident in higher use of masks, provision of sanitizer on PT etc. Rational thought tells me there is no more risk of contacting this virus than contracting a cold or flu on the plane but it is the social media and news media that brings on the hysteria - ""deadly virus"" etc etc. You can see how it has affected us here in Australia with the Shark Finn Inn in China Town Melbourne closing due to a huge drop in customers. In Perth an Asian student returning from Malaysia was locked out of her share house and all her possessions put on the front lawn. A family of Chinese descent living in a suburb in Perth had a message ""Virus go home"" sprayed on their driveway!! The world is going crazy. It is hard to stay rational in this type of climate."
"Hi Michelle, Yes we are flying from Sydney to Seoul via Gold Coast so no concerns about entry to SK. Forum members based in SK say there is no reason to cancel trips. Ofcourse, everyone has to exercise extra caution as the threat from the virus is real. Agree that social media and mainstream media have created fear which resulted in panic to some. It's a different world we live in today.All the best in your travel to SK and I hope that your son's wedding goes well."
"Thanks, I hope that transit through Singapore will be okay. That's the main concern for us. No concerns at all had we been flying direct from Australia."
Yes ours cannot be refunded too. We will push through with our trip too:)
Sorry to butt into this forum. Wonder how the South Koreans are towards Chinese travellers from other parts of the world. I know they are nervous abt Chinese from china and 7nfortunately we all look alike. We have a trip plan for end of March and hope to be able to go and ve a good time not be shun away.Hope someone can helpThanksYsh
"A lil bit nerveous read news today..15 people infected increasing by today, 13 in daegu with no history travel to china or etc...huhu anyone can update how the situation?hopefully S.Korea not following Japan in this case..*pray"

ya i believe that’s a wise choice since it involves an elderly

We're supposed to be flying from SFO to MNL via ICN (and back) in May/June with the long layovers giving us a chance to spend the day in Seoul. So it's definitely sad to see the current situation. Especially with some countries now considering travel restrictions and/or quarantine for people even just transiting through Korea.

They want you to be a Skypass member. Old technology. Create a Skypass account - add your reservation to it - should work properly. I also expect site overload from all the cancellations and refunds and chaos.
"Seoul is very dangerous because the transmission of the Korona19 virus has just begun. also Jeju Island is also dangerous because there are more people infected. All schools are currently closed in Korea, and it is getting serious as the school is due to be extended until April. It's not appropriate to travel. Please cancel it."
