"Hi,My family and I are traveling to Bali from the UK transiting via Singapore. We are obviously concerned about catching the coronavirus at either the airport or our onward flight to Bali (and back again). Was wondering if any Singaporeans had any ideas of what precautions have been put in place?Thank you."

"Hi,Thanks Bill, departure date for us is 6/5/20 so sometime before we will need to make a decision. Take care."
I’m also travelling through Singapore (transit 5 hours) to India. But I heard Singapore has banned transit entry too? But the airlines are still taking the bookings. What about you?
"RageshEmperumal, transits are not allowed for non-residents and I don’t think it will be lifted in the near future.You will need to change your booking or defer your trip. https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19Edited: 2:31 pm, April 15, 2020 "
