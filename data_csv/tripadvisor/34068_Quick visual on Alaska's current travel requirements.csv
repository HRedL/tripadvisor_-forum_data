"Thanks, Craig! It is a great graphic, I think. Hope HI. copies it if they decide to try and do this."
"I like that chart because it makes it much easier to understand the different paths for visiting. I wondering what is/is not allowed under the ""minimize interactions/monitor"" phase? Also, it says a second test is administered 7-14 days after arrival, I wonder how they decide whether it's 7 days, 13 days, etc. Also, does the State bear the cost of all those tests (incl. airport tests and/or second round test) or does the visitor? I believe Hawaii has a much higher number of visitors annually, so to have the State foot the bill would be tough (although perhaps they could build it in as a visitor tax?)."
"For those who have hopped over to the Alaska forum, what has the feedback on this process been? I realize there's no solution that would be problem-free, but if this appears to be working okay for Alaska, as some have pointed out, it could be a good blueprint for Hawaii to open up travel further in a few months...Just wondering if it seems to be working well?"
"If I recall correctly, tests done at the airport in Alaska are free for the traveler--BUT they are not guaranteed to be available. Other tests are at the traveler's expense.I think HI will prob do something very similar. It's what the Lt Guv and others have been proposing for weeks. I also think it will be a chaotic mess, at least for the first 2-3 weeks.......whenever that is."
"This was posted in the Alaska travel forum by someone I would gather is one of that forum's destination experts who simplified it a little....That person also responded later with an update that Airport tests were taking 3-5 days to get results back...—— Here is the law/rule.
