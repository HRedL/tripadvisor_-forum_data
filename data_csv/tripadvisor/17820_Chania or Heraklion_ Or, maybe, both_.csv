"No luck in Greece forum, so trying again here.The question is: we're planning our vacation in about the end of August-the beginning of September (still undecided because of lots of circumstancies) for 5-7 days. So, we can't decide one more thing - what to choose - Chania or Heraklion? Since we are from Lithuania where salaries still aren't that big, we have about 400 Euro budget (accomodation doesn't count, we're planning to look for AIrbnb flat/studio and a view from a window is not very important, but of course, we wouldn't be happy to see the walls of other buildings or recycle bins). We're more interested in sightseeing or visiting museums and/or other places of interest. Also, we don't drive a car and usually go everywhere on foot. So we need objects in walking distancies. We're not afraid of long distancies (we walked 22 km (in one day) in Florence, Italy, last autumn) but prefer a bit shorter distancies though. What would you advice to see and visit - Chania and/or Heraklion? If possible, please, tell about both. Where it's more worth to go with such low budget? I understand, it's a silly question, but such is a life. We're not interested in clubbing or shopping or going to the beach. Any recommendations? Thank you for any answer."
Just a quick reply for now but based on your interests I would suggest flying in to Heraklion and have a look at a base a little east of Heraklion with good bus links such as Stalis or Hersonissos.

For historical sites/museums etc then as much as l love the west of Crete the Heraklion/Lassithi area has far more.p.s. for beaches the west is betterEdited: 1 year ago 
"Also as much as I love the villages etc around Chania they don't match the history and atmosphere of the villages in the Heraklion/Lasithi area such as Mochos, Vrahassi, Kritsa, Krasi, Neapolis, Pano Milatos etc which is something I really miss when we are visiting the west side of Crete."
"Thank you very much for your answers. We'll discuss what to chose. BTW, i was looking for accommodation through Airbnb and found that it's cheaper in Heraklion than in Chania, or am I wrong? We're not looking for a luxurious apartments, we only need basic amenities as we plan only returning for a night's sleep :) And one more question. As we travel to find out not only country's history but also cuisine, what would you recommend to eat? As we visited Paphos we ate at Vasano Tavern and were excited by chicken and pork kebabs. What should (ot MUST) we try in Crete?"
Heraklion itself would also make a fantastic base for what you are looking for.

"They are both great cities, and given your interests and the fact that you aren't beach-goers, I think you'll find staying in the centre of each for a few days very rewarding.Chania is Crete's most beautiful city: many think it the most beautiful in all of Greece. The old town and harbour are fascinating to explore. There is an excellent guide to Chania: Fenny's Chania. It was out of print for some time, but I think is now available again: I'll try to find an online source and will tell you if I do, or you may be able to find a copy in one of the shops in the old town.Heraklion is a different story. Most visitors spend one day there to visit Knossos and then flee to the beach, complaining about the traffic. It IS a big, bustling, noisy, traffic-filled city, but it's a real, Cretan working town with a lively, friendly atmosphere, wonderful street markets, and a wealth of impressive Venetian structures: the fortress, the city walls, the public buildings and fountains and churches. You're museum-lovers, so you'll probably want to make at least two visits to the world class Archaeological Museum - and if you stay in the city for a few days you'll have plenty of time for that. And, of course, Knossos, Crete's most important archaeological site. You'll also be able to visit Crete's other major ancient sites: Phaestos, Gortys, Malia by public bus. And there are plenty of good, inexpensive eating places. When you've found a few airbnbs you like the look of, please come back and post links to them: we may be able to provide details of the areas they are in, and their suitability given the things you want to do.Finally, I agree with Jill that you should if at all possible avoid August: it will be hot, crowded, and expensive. You'll have a much better time in late September or even early October. Is it possible? I hope so."
"My (very limited) experience would suggest Chania as others have said. It's a prettier city, there are plenty of museums, there's good shopping, good beaches (either walkable or on the bus - I know you said you aren't beachgoers but just walking along at sunset or doing some windowshopping is great), and also quieter than Heraklion. There's a good bus service around and you can visit not just ancient historical sites but also some WW2 battlefields.We liked Heraklion in our brief visits while ferrying to Santorini (2 nights) but it lacked the ""magic"" of Chania. So, my advice might be: Chania, with a very busy day trip to Knossos (it's doable but will be exhausting).Edited: 1 year ago "
"I stayed in Chania in the Theotokopolou St. Area and loved it. Beautiful town filled with shops, markets and tavernas, historical sites, waterfront and lots more. We were there in early October and the weather was sunny, mild, and just a bit of rain. Mostly short sleeve shirts during the day and some nights. Good place to base yourself to explore the west end of the island.I haven't stayed in Heraklion so can't comment on it. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you pick Chania.I have a copy of the walking guide to Chania and highly recommend it if you can find it. Filled with lots of info about the town and its history.Edited: 1 year ago "
Just to add that my suggestion of Heraklion was based on making the occasional short public bus journey as well which is pretty cheap in Crete so wouldn't eat too much in to your budget.
HiShare your time.5 days in Heraklion and two days in Chania.
"Thank you for the answers. They will really help next year. This year I must cancel all my plans. First, I was fired after the trial period (it's very popular working method here in Lithuania, and the worst thing - everything is legal). So now I'm still jobless I'm too old, I think, for many of our so-called employers... - if you're over 25 - you're too old. Such is the life...). The second worst thing that happened to me - on the day I was fired my father broke his leg, underwent the operation and after two weeks he passed away. I don't want even to remember things that happened after the funeral - it could be described as silly bad thriller. Now I am looking for a new job and even if I succeed me and my BF won't be able to go on vacation together. So big thanks for your answers and I hope they will be useful next year.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Ruta, I'm so sorry for all your troubles! It's very good of you to return to the forum under these circumstances to thank us for our help. I hope you will be able to get to Crete next year, and rest assured we will be here to continue the conversation with you and answer any questions you may have then.Meanwhile best of luck with finding a new and more fulfilling job."
"Hello again. Sad news though... Seems we have to cancel our trip this year, too... This time due to virus. Just came here to ask people about situation in your country. Yes, it's about COVID-19. Today just found out therere's one infected in Greece, too. What is the real situation? Thanks for the answers."
"HiYes, we may have someone in Thessalonikibut she is doing well and a group of doctors follow the progress.After the latest news from the World Health Organization the virus is no more dangerous than the usual flu virus. Only it is more quick to contaminate.The high risk groups are the same in both viruses and a big persentage carries the virus but has no symptoms. In my opinion panic is never a good advisor.Anyway, all virus disappear in the begining of spring.Edited: 8:36 am, February 26, 2020 "
"This is a situation which can, and does, change on a daily basis; but for the time being I see no reason to cancel your trip. As far as i know you have no epidemic in your home country, and there are no cases in Crete."
"Yes, ou are right. There still is no news about the virus in Lithuania, but I think it's only question of time when it happens. Everything you know is what they (our government) wants you to know. They say they are ready for virus spreading but what we see, this is chaos. If you could read about one man who came back to Vilnius from North Italy and felt not very well was diagnosed in our main healthcaring center Santaros klinikos. He was sent there from one private clinic. Good to know he was not diagnosed with Covid-19, but he had to report this to his doctor himself. Santara didn't report because of protection of personal data.We also hope spring will help fight the virus and still are waiting for more sun to appear. Only we want cheaper tickets and the more we wait the more expensive tey get. So we are in doubt â€“ we really want to have this trip but also we are aware of side diseases we (maybe) have. I think I'm quite healthy, but my b/f has some health issues. So better safe than sorry."
"So as you probably already know, we already have one case confirmed in Å iauliai (I live in Vilnius, this is quite far from Å iauliai). So I was right sayying Corona coming was only a question of time. So far as I know she is doing fine and is in hospital. Not panicking, but not very happy about the news."
"Ruta - while I understand your concern, I think it's possible to overreact. I have two trips planned over the next few months - one to Southeast Asia, the other to Greece. I'm considering cancelling the one to Asia, but haven't even considered cancelling to Greece (unless they have an outbreak of tens of thousands, and even then I'd probably still go. I don't stay inside at home when thousands of people in the States have come down with the flu).Edited: 12:28 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"OK, latest news. Today we already have 8 cases. Or, maybe, 7. The first woman who was diagnosed with virus finally has been released from hospital. But there's a question about quarantine in ALL the country. Now Lithuania has closed all borders.Another not so very good news is my job. As a freelancer now I wait for new orders so I must save my money for my everyday needs. I hope this situation will get better soon."
