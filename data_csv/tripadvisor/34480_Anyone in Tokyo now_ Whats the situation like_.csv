"Hi, l can't find many news reports on what the situation is like on the ground this week.Some first hand accounts would be very welcome. Is there alot of panic and are the majority of residents wearing surgical masks? I read that stores were sold out of masks very early every morning.We aren't scheduled to fly out until the end of March for our first trip to Japan, so we are waiting to see how this situation develops. It is a trip of a lifetime that is going to cost us so much and the flight will not be refundable if we cancel, so having it ruined because of virus scares is depressing."

"I was in Tokyo last week and returned to US yesterday. People are wearing masks: Yes, people are panicking: No"
The link works for me. I'm not a subscriber.
We are also in the same situation we are flying out to japan in March and we are still waiting to hear what the situation is out there as there seems to be a lot of people being infected and bringing the total up to 45. We have also booked flights and domestic flights and also accommodations and excursions we too was told we may not be able to get back our money if we cancel it is very sad and depressing.
"That link when you click on x number of stories, gives a message saying ""You’ve reached your story limit as a non-registered user."" Then gives the option of paying $30 a month or $9 a month to register. It is not free."
"Same boat. Going March 11th. I called the airline and they said they are not offering waivers for Japan. Only China. So you can cel for a few, usually 125 but you don’t lose the entire amount you paid. It can be used as a credit . Don’t quote me as some railings might have different policies. I am going to wait until 2 weeks before and make a decision then. My nightmare is that what if we get it and get quarantined there for 2 weeks? That would be an utter disaster."

"For the article Dave148 listed right click on the link and select ""open link in new private window"". it works for me. I am going over on the seventeenth and expect a great trip. Much less crowded than last year and locals may be more welcoming without the overtourism that has troubled the Kansai recently. I will bring my own masks and hand sanitizer and will disinfect my mouth and throat with shochu on a regular basis"
"Are more people buying/wearing masks - not noticeably.I've spent most of the last week criss-crossing Tokyo on the trains with something I was working on and certainly no panic. People would be more worried about flu and catching a cold than a random, less than one in a million chance of meeting someone with ""a"" new virus.@Karen D - the Japantimes has a very weak pay-wall - I often read 20 articles a day there for some local news. Not hard to read unlimited articles every month for free. However, there are many other news sites that people can access."
"Please correct me if I’m wrong. I believe we are still in a wait and see situation. At this time the new cases came from a cruise ship. They are not from being infected inside Japan. Therefore as long as there’s not a huge increase in the number of cases in Japan I feel it should be OK to travel.However at the end of the day you need to do what you are comfortable with. Even if there are not an increase in the number of cases I still plan on cutting my trip short. I’m going to run the Tokyo marathon and then probably head straight back to the US. The longer you travel within Asia , the more likely you are at risk for potentially Being exposed. This is a dynamic and changing situation. Hopefully it has been contained but I feel it’s still early to tell. The next two weeks will be revealing."
My friends in Tokyo are saying the same as Japan Custom Tours. No panic and it’s business as usual. I went out in Kyōto last night and it was really quiet in Kiyamachi and on Pontocho alley. Not great for all of the new bars and hotels but the bright side for residents is that it’s less crowded. Several small places were closed on a Friday night and that was a slight surprise. One place had a “temporarily closed” sign written in English on its door.
">>""then probably head straight back to the US.""<<.... where there have been 210,000+ hospitalisations for flu this winter and 12,000+ deaths .... Yes, you'll be much safer there.https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm"
"@tonytty i’m not sure why people like to compare the corona virus to the flu. I’m actually a doctor and get exposed to the flu and All kinds of viruses on a daily basis in the hospital. However the flu does not kill a young healthy adult. It may make you ill for a while but you will recover. The people you see die from the flu are the elderly and those that have other medical conditions. So when I see our young Chinese doctor that first reported this viral outbreak that supposedly has no other medical problems die from this infection, yes I am concerned. Any viral outbreak is a public safety health concern. They still don’t have a handle on this. We are in a wait and see. It’s not to cause panic but it’s reality. I have travels to japan before and even my former tour guides who live in Japan are cautioning travel."
"Influenza can absolutely still be fatal for a healthy young adult. Do not underestimate it. To make such a claim as a 'doctor' is terrible. The elderly and very young are at the highest risk but the flu can be very serious for anyone. My 2yr old child died from the flu. I wish that more people took it seriously and did more to prevent its spread. It's flu season in Japan as well so for anyone visiting soon, get your flu shot if you haven't already."
"We fly into Tokyo early April and there's no way in the world I am cancelling this trip. Yes, we will be cautious and take precautions but what I have experienced so far is the Japanese government to be extremely cautious about the medical side of things - we have to jump through a million hoops just to get permission to bring my husband's CPAP machine into the country, and the new strict identification procedures when you stay at hotels and Air Bnb's - and it gives me great confidence that the Japanese government will put into place stringent conditions on people entering their country. Be cautious, but don't panic."
"#11 & 13 are absolutely correct, the cases outside of China are but 1% and currently under control. It is those like the OP and others who are panicking and responding emotionally to what they don’t bother to or unable to understand.I think what #14 meant to say is that generally young healthy people have a much greater survival rate than older people and infants and older people are the majority who are more likely to die.According to this report https:/… 80% of Corona deaths are in those 60 years age who have greater underlying health issues that make survival more difficult. So it appears to be affecting people in a similar way to flu though 20% are under 60 years age, which is still much greater what flu would cause.From the figures currently available in the link above and elsewhere we know that Corona has about 2.2% fatality vs current flu at about 0.05% potential fatality, about 44 times difference, which is significant.Edited: 9:31 pm, February 07, 2020 "
>>>>I’m actually a doctor and get exposed to the flu and All kinds of viruses on a daily basis in the hospital. However the flu does not kill a young healthy adult. <<<The flu sure kills young and healthy adults too. I've seen it many times. Are you sure you got a proper medical license?
"@Dr. shibuyakki are you a “real doctor”. Would be curious to see your training and credentials?@cmackir968 I’m sorry for the loss of your child. Please don’t misquote me. I said adult. The flu is most deadly in those whose immune system is compromised or not fully developed. And yes, that includes children. That is why flu immunization is important. Agree with the points made by Ali0211."
"#17 No I am not panicking, just would like to know what the situation is like, and if Japanese citizens are worried and wearing masks and avoiding contact with people. I have spent the last 3 1/2 years studying japanese and was hoping to get some one on one practice while there. It would certainly be disappointing if i had to communicate with people wearing masks the whole trip. 10 years ago we had the Swine flu epidemic here in Mexico and for a couple of weeks schools closed and people avoided contact and only conducted necessary business. Once the weather warmed up it was over for the most part."
">>>@Dr. shibuyakki are you a “real doctor”. Would be curious to see your training and credentials?<<My credentials and training are just fine. I went to one of the top medical schools in the US and graduated in top 2%. I trained and practiced as a pulmonologist/intensivist in one of the finest institutions in California. I worked many years in the ICU and that's where I saw many young and healthy die from the flu. I'm also a PhD in biology, and I accomplished all that in my second luggage. I don't know who you really are but if you're a real medical doctor, you shouldn't be saying something stupid like, ""However the flu does not kill a young healthy adult""."
@Dr. Shibuyaakko not sure what your credentials are or where you practiced. A young healthy adult dying from complications of the flu is more the exception than the rule. Perhaps you did not take a full history on your patients or on not current on treatments.Perhaps review this from the cdc on influenza. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm
"""Anyone in Tokyo now?"" Yes, LOTS of people are in Tokyo! No panic. Yes, people wear masks -- as it's always been a ""tradition"" to wear masks, especially during flu season. Good news for the flu, though. Since everyone is ""into hygiene"" these days with lots of hand washing and gargling, the cases of ""regular flu"" have gone down! Over 600,000 people die from influenza worldwide each year, but it's good to know Japan won't be contributing as much to the list this season.Meanwhile there are 64 people (of different nationalities) from the cruise ship who have been transported to hospitals in Yokohama and Tokyo for treatment of 2019 n-CoV (corona virus). Some passengers who are in rooms with balconies have been putting up signs asking for medication.... and beer. The latest news said the US wants to retrieve the American passengers, but they haven't come up with any plans. Some passengers have also been taken off for ""not feeling well"" (not affiliated with any virus). Another cruise ship is wandering around Okinawa, looking for a port that will let them dock. If you're on a cruise that stopped in China or southeast Asia, things don't look very cheery. Ginza, Asakusa and lots of touristy areas are nice to visit these days. Not so many tourists! Now would be a good time to go to Kyoto! Reminds me of when tourists retreated from coming to Japan after the earthquake on March 11, 2011."
"Only fools misled by the media are in panic. Do a little research. A lot of people in Tokyo wear masks everyday. Do you know that it's considered rude to blow your nose in public in Japan?Don't let them, whoever you believe them to be, control you.The coronavirus is no more dangerous to a healthy adult than a common cold. And, if you're not a healthy adult, you might want to postpone any travel.https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus Common Symptoms of CoronavirusThe symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.You could get lab tests, including nose and throat cultures and blood work, to find out whether your cold was caused by a coronavirus, but there's no reason to. The test results wouldn't change how you treat your symptoms, which typically go away in a few days.But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease, or people with weakened immune systems.Edited: 9:53 am, February 08, 2020 "
"#22All you said in #14 was, "" the flu does not kill a young healthy adult."" That's what I wanted to correct because that is a total false statement. I have seen several previously healthy young adults with no chronic illness die from the flu in my long years in the ICU. If you're a family practitioner, you may not see a young and healthy die from the flu yourself."

"You can see how many people died from the flu here:https:/…2018-2019.htmlOf course morality among older adults 65+ is much higher than that of younger group. But 8,126 people age 18-64 died from the flu in 2018-19, and 9,554 in 2017-18. That is a lot."
I am flying to a Tokyo on April 18th and taking a trip. I am worried too. I booked my flight with AirChina 2 months ago and they won’t refund me back. I paid deposit to my tour company. I don’t know how everything is in Japan.
If it becomes worse they might refund you but I think you might wanna wait until a few weeks before you leave to check back on the situation. My thoughts are that we will probably know much more about the virus in a couple of months and panic may have gone down. I’m leaving for Tokyo in May myself
"Hi Jason.Except for the cruise ship (Diamond Princess), everything is not that serious in Japan so far.Honestly, I think Brighton & Hove and a French ski resort town might be more dangerous than Japan now...NO super spreader has been found in Japan, however, The UK has one."
"The coronavirus infection has NOT been spread out in Japan, except at a cruise ship in Yokohama. Many Japanese wear masks in winter before this coronavirus. Lower motility due to influenza in Japan than in the U.S.A. has shown this. Thus, I'd recommend you not to take any cruise and to bring masks and buy travel insurance. I assume that this virus outbreak will be over by April when it gets warmer as the SARS was, as Chinese government’s senior medical adviser said, as follows.https:/….XkLIRC3ANSx"
"All of us that live here in Japan can tell you everything is business as usual but if you have doubts, Don't come. You will probably have a bad time, always looking around at people that sneeze or cough, wondering if it's safe to touch the door handle. I want people to enjoy themselves here, not be on constant alert for a virus, you probably won't get."
"Sunday, February 16, I went to Nihonbashi today. Didn't see many tourists. The entire staff at Mitsukoshi Department Store had masks. The people at information, elevator girls/guides, clerks.... everyone. Went to the Coredo buildings across the street. No one who was working in the shops had masks. People were out an about shopping, browsing, eating, etc. Life goes on. It's cold season, as well as hay fever/pollen season. People have always worn masks where there are crowds. But there seems to be more people than ""usual."" As to be expected, some people are putting the masks on incorrectly, ie their masks are below their noses -- which totally defeats the purpose of a mask! lol Handwashing and using alcohol wipes are pretty common everywhere. My friend offered me an alcohol wipe when she saw me riding the escalator and touching the hand belt. I declined it then as I knew I would be touching more handrails when using the stairs, etc. But when we sat down for lunch, it was well appreciated. If you have a ""real cold"" and have the sneezes and snuffles, stay home until you get better. It's not a good time to be sick in public."
"I was there on the first week of February. Everything was normal. The trains can get still packed without any signs of panic or attention regarding the virus. The districts like shibuya are still lively and full of people. Many are wearing masks, I’m not sure if there was an increase for mask wearers, but I think wearing masks are also part of their culture, not just because of the virus outbreak. And there are still plenty of people not wearing masks, so the situation is pretty normal and you won’t see any signs of panic.I was there when the cruise ship docked in Yokohama. Still, no signs of locals and tourists panicking with regards to the situation.Japan has 20+ cases (correct me if I’m wrong with the numbers) in the mainland Japan, and the other 60+ cases are only specific in the cruise ship. Japan has 120 million plus population. The ratio is very low.Just be careful all the time like how you also do it at home. Bring sanitizers, wear masks if the place is too crowded (like on trains during rush hours), and stay warm this winter. Everything will be fine."
"We still don't know how much spread it is. There are more cases reported this weekend with unknown routes and the cruise passengers will disembark from the 19th.If you have chronic diseases, postponing your trip might be a good idea."
"CarterStrife, your numbers are way behind. There are now 51 cases in mainland, 350 from the ship. In the past two days, 15 new cases where many were tied to a taxi driver boat party that essentially spread it amongst multiple taxi drivers....my sense is there is going to be a marked uptick over the next couple weeks coming off those cases. But point is still noted that it is small numbers when you are comparing against the population."
"We were visiting Tokyo two days back and found no reason to wear masks (just avoided rush hours as usual). And saw very little evidence (none) of flu symptoms on public transport we used. But did notice no one using the hand rail on escalatorsEdited: 7:17 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Even the chance of running into them is still low, there were some cases that the patients used trains before they were hospitalized."
"Feeling the same way.. my trip is scheduled for next Saturday.. since is a life time trip , I will still go but I wanted to understand where to get news of the situation in Japan"
"The information that I now have is that""The Government of Japan will NOT cover the costs associated with treatment during this time, and you will be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.""https:/…Since WHO declared COVID-19 an Global Emergency travel insurance companies are not covering incidents related to the Coronavirus. So I guess this means everyone travels at their own risk if they leave their country to visit Japan? Does anyone have information contrary to this?"

"I ready your post on travel to japan, would you advise against it?"
"This link hasn't been updated as there are now 3 deaths. The first was a woman from Sagamihara in her 80's who was diagnosed AFTER she died. The other two who died today, were a man, 87, from Kanagawa prefecture who was on the Diamond Princess and had a heart condition, and a woman from Tokyo who was 84. She had no chronic illnesses. https:/…There are some events that have been cancelled, and the government is asking everyone to use ""caution,"" especially at indoor events/meetings. I work out at a fitness center several times a week. No one wears a mask -- it's hard to do aerobic exercises if you can't breathe! Wash hands, gargle, wear a mask when you're in a crowd, eat well, sleep well, keep your immunity up. I would say 50% of the people who are walking about wear masks. 50% don't. There are still many tourists all over.(Some wear masks, some don't.) Just not so many Chinese groups. It feels like ""tourism"" from several years ago. You don't have to fight the crowds! Many temples and shrines have have taken off the ""bells"" and closed off the purifying water. People are avoiding touching each other. No hugs or high fives. But bowing works! Back to ""tradition""! Just an update from Tokyo."
"Thank you Mamajeli@51 for the updates.Edited: 12:07 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"No changes in public baths or onsens. Cleanliness is necessary to keep any form of bacteria or virus away. The places that operate the baths and onsens seem to spending more time in cleaning everything thoroughly with alcohol. They're doing that at karaoke places, too. Here's an example. https:/…20200220.htmlBut... if you feel lethargic and sick, have a fever, coughing, etc., please DO NOT go take a bath. In fact, don't go anywhere. Stay home."
"Spectator sports and concerts where there are large crowds of random people are getting cancelled. They will still have marathons and golf tournaments with ""invited guests."" Just no ""public runners"" or spectators. Stay at home and watch on TV. Puroland (Hello Kitty) will be closed until March 12. https://en.puroland.jpHokkaido's favorite cookie souvenir ""Shiroi Koibito"" will stop production for awhile. There are many hotels that have lost their clientele and are now struggling. Same with tour companies and bus companies. Department sales went down 70% in February. (Let that sink in!) Convenience stores sales went UP -- with sales of masks and hand wipes, etc. The biggest topic of interest in these past two days is ""how to prevent."" Unless you want to be a hermit, there doesn't seem to be an answer. Even if you stay at home, you will need to eat. So.....if you can't go to the supermarket, do you order through the internet? When the doorbell rings, you will need to sign off for it.... and meet face to face with the delivery person. Reality? Life goes on. My observation. 50% of the passengers on trains have masks. The other half doesn't. If you have an ailment, DO take precautions and extra care. If you have a fever for 2 days, contact www.mlit.go.jp/kankocho/content/001328767.pdf phone: 050-3816-2787 in English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.If you are healthy, be mindful, and wash your hands, gargle, wear a mask when going into a crowd, eat well, sleep well, keep your immunity level high and close the toilet lid when your flush. Good hygiene is important."
"I had to go to Kamakura today. It is about an hour from Tokyo.On the way back, I changed seats when I heard somebody nearby is coughing.I think I changed more than three times. There were many men coughing.Maybe many of them had a cold but how can you tell it wasn't coronavirus with them?Edited: 7:26 am, February 21, 2020 "
"I wasn’t even coughing today when I got on my train in Ashiya (Hyogo) and found an open seat with an older Japanese man on the window and he looked at me, grunted and stood up as i was about to sit next to him and angrily shoved his way by me to get away from me!? The people across the aisle leaned over to watch him storm off and then looked at me and I just shrugged my shoulders at them and sat down in the two seats to myself. That’s some paranoia."
"Ah... Kobekeith.... I told you to take a shower this morning! LOL There was a lady sitting next to me yesterday in a t-shirt on the subway. I had on a down jacket. She was sneezing and coughing as she drank a plastic container of coffee. I think it went down the wrong tube, hence the gag/cough. Other passengers glared at her. After she had her drink, she took out a mask and put it on. But she was still sneezing.... and was only wearing that t-shirt. Hot flashes? Or just a cold? Or allergies? I didn't stay on long enough to find out. Came home, washed my hands and gargled. And had some wine. They say alcohol is a good cleanser. :-)"
Lol... I doubt that. Maybe he just wanted 2 seats to himself. Or I look like a potentially sick person.
"Well, I don't know if you looked dirty or looked quite weird, Kobekeith san.Weren't you wearing a T-shirt with some offensive Japanese words on it?Mamajelli san, I think she had pollen allergy. I take medicine so I won't sneeze that much while it works, but my eyes are itchy.Edited: 8:16 am, February 21, 2020 "
"If the tiny, orange Ralph Lauren polo horse on my coat was offensive, I apologize. Or my Prada eyeglasses were smudged. And I have been using the same leather Porter bag (made in Japan) for over a year. It still looks newer but maybe he thought I was so “last decade” to be using a bag purchased in 2018. Is that rude? My friends tell me that it’s weird that my Ted Baker shoes always look so shiny. I’ll try to dress more foreign devil acceptable from now on. Backpack, t-shirt in February, dirty jeans and beach sandals?"
"Maybe the old guy just didn't like foreigners to sit next to him.It's getting off the track.Day after day, more cases are found in Greater Tokyo area, but except the hot spot in Wakayama, the west side is rather quite these days.Edited: 8:53 am, February 21, 2020 "
But aren't the infections confined to that cruise ship?
"My friend in Osaka says that masks have sold out.But aren't all the cases listed as ""in Japan"" actually on that one quarantined cruise ship rather than in society?"
"No and no. There are cases beyond the cruise ship and the people who were on the cruise ship are now spreading out around who knows where. People from the ship with the virus are not sitting on the ship. They were brought to to different places.Masks and antibacterial hand cleaners / soaps are sold out. The shelves are empty.Edited: 7:00 pm, February 21, 2020 "
"If my trip at the end of March goes ahead, I'm going to bring a suitcase full of hand sanitiser, wipes and masks and set up a tripadvisor collection depot. Should be a fun meet-up! :)"
I’m the same. I’m hoping to fly to Amsterdam on the 15th. Will stock up. I’m down to very few masks. No hand sanitizer and a packet of semi dried-up antibacterial wipes that I found in a drawer at home last night.
"There have already been positive cases who have no contact with Diamond Princess passengers, tourists from China, neither travel abroad nor domestic in the past months. It may be a third or fourth or more contact which is hard to trace."
I got hand sanitizer sheets at the 100 yen store yesterday in Setagaya (Tokyo). They had all different brands. (And I wasn't even looking!) Drugstores were sold out.
