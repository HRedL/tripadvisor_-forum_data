with the recent locked down in Italy does anyoneKnow if they are still allowed to fly to Cayo Largo? To me this is a big concern considering they have so many cases and the numbers are not getting any better. I am worried for the Cubans workers and the tourists? Being a small Island I am not sure they would be well equipped to deal with this situation if they started to get infected and I find it pretty odd they don’t have any cases already.
"I believe they can still fly fromRome but as of today Milan and northern Italy are in quarantine. A plane from Milan and one from Rome arrived in Cayo Largo on Saturday. Not sure if tourists were allowed to stay, assume so. So yes, it is a real concern there."
Hi and thanks for answering me Laura. I wasn’t sure if they landed this weekend. If they continue to allow them I will cancel our trip there.
This news is very concerning for paradise Cayo Largo. First the runway closure and now a distinct possibility of Covid -19 being imported from Italy.I highly doubt the passengers were screened when they left Italy.Really hoping this disease does not infect the workers and tourists in Cayo Largo.
There are still flights from Milan to Cuba:https:/…
It seems to be one big mess. Some flights cancelled but others going. And people supposedly in quarantine are flying and just stepping off the planes.
Wow Laura where did you se that? What a free for all. They don’t seem to care that they are spreading the virus I guess. It’s just unbelievable how the gouvernement is not doing anything about it. If Cuba doesn’t seem to care maybe they should just welcome Italians now.
"The Milan flights today included London, Madrid and other world capitols.Many more deaths from the Flu and we have a vaccine for that."
It’s in some of the British tabloids as planes took off today for UK. People were confused. Not sure how reliable the sources are though. Plus the link below from SpunkyHB shows lots of flights took off but many cancelled. Yet the Italian Prime Minister said only emergency travel etc.
"@Spunky. Here is some good proof for you that the coronavirus is way more devastating. In case you are not interested in reading it. The flu kills 1 in 1000 versus the coronavirus 1 in 100. https:/…coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspxEdited: 8:02 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"The flu kills 1 in 1000 in North America where we know it and are ready and COVID killed 1 in 100 worldwide (mostly in China) where it wasn't known and nobody was ready for it.One thing for sure, health experts have warned us to get the flu vaccine to help us survive a possible COVID infection."
"Yes I am afraid this is no flu. I work in healthcare and preparation is under way to combat this. I do think we will be fine, we will manage this. No need to panic but we must take it seriously if we are to get through with minimal disrupt."
"Lets hope the newest Italian tourists who landed in Cayo Largo do not have the virus and/or spread it to workers and guests.Cuba claims they have deployed doctors to all resorts and they boast they did not have a single case of SARS thanks to their intensive screening process.It will be very interesting to see how many corona cases will emerge in Cuba , especially since they are freely allowing plane loads of Italians to enter, despite the lockdown in Italy."
"No 12, are you sure that tourist flights are still leaving Italy, even after the country-wide lockdown was announced on Monday?No 10, citation? Since the flu isn't a coronavirus I'm having a very hard time believing the flu vaccine is relevant at all. Still a good idea to get a flu shot, though."
Those who have even a mild case of influenza are immune compromised and easy targets for viruses.
"Thanks Spunky, that's a fair point."
As are children with asthma who take steroids. Steroids like prednisone suppress our immune systems.
