"My wife and I are planning a trip to Cozumel in July, but are extremely concerned about Coronavirus on the island. Particularly from the cruise ships. HAs the government issues a ban on cruise ships and what else are they doing to prevent outbreak? We are VERY VERY CONCERNED.A."
"We're leaving for Coz Monday. We'll take the prescribed precautions, and plan on having another great time."
If you're VERY VERY concerned then don't go. IMO the island will never ban cruise ships for any reason.
https:/…
Sure there are reasons to be concerned. But July is far away. I would just chill and see how things turn out.

Agreed DSDWhiskers
"in today's Por Esto:Coronavirus Covid-19 could affect the arrival of cruise ships in CancunCozumel does not report any possible involvement in the operation of ships due to this diseaseMarch 6, 2020Coronavirus Covid-19 could affect the arrival of cruise ships in CancunAlthough Cozumel does not report any involvement in the cruise operation, this segment can be impacted in the coming months by the noise generated by the coronavirus, Covid-19 in many countries, which keeps tourism service providers like dolphinariums cautious and attentive. , since this segment represents 5 to 7% of its operations in cruise destinations. This was reported by Eduardo Albor, CEO of Grupo Dolphin that operates in eight countries with 31 parks and habitats.The attention is maintained, he said, because in destinations such as Jamaica and Cayman Islands they are reporting cruise ship cancellations and arrival of vessels due to the noise that has been made of the health issue and this has been causing cancellations to other service providers. Case in point what was recorded last week with the cruise that was not allowed to berth in some countries.“In the case of Cozumel, in Mexico, no impact has been felt so far on the issues of operation, however, we are very cautious, we are a little worried about the effect that could occur this month with cruise ships, because that is where the subject has made more noise, ”he said.In that regard, he commented that the service provider sector remains cautious of the reaction that is being taken on the issue, both in airlines, cruises and travel agencies to be prevented.At the moment he informed that they remain cautious in matters of capital investment, with an intelligent management of resources and redirecting market strategies to continue encouraging the trip and the visit to habitats.March, he said, is for the cruise industry a very good month, but it will depend on how the circumstances are going to be and if the tourist who is traveling by cruise will really be going down in the destinations.In the case of the Mexican Caribbean, the investor said that the issue of the coronavirus has not been so strong and it could be that as a destination it reports a growth by the people who are redirecting the trip, but the focus is on the people who by the effect The health situation decides not to travel, and that is where the market risk is.“Cozumel has done a good job and it is not an alert point, we know it, but it is important that passengers know it, so it said that so far we do not feel impact on assistance, but we have to keep monitoring it day by day , maybe not this week, but what will happen in the following, ”he said.In that expectation the CEO said that as a company you always have a plan B and a plan B1 and B2 and B3, in the confidence that this situation will finally benefit destinations, but it is important to be attentive to the entire market."
"Hey Rex maybe we'll bump into you at the airport on Monday as that's when we arrive as well :)The hysteria around this virus is way out of proportion to it's actual impact. People are freaking out over a published mortality rate of 3.4%. If the actual number of people infected were known and were counted (hint: there are many thousands infected, right now, the US alone despite being told of only 114 cases), you are looking at actual mortality rate far lower than what's being reported. SARS killed 11% of those infected or 3x more than Covid. The world did not end.Wash your hands more, touch your face less and live your life. Oh yeah, by the way, how's that Zika thing these days?"
Since you asked there were 32000 cases of Zika in 2019 - most in South America SARS infected 8500 people with maybe 10% mortalityCovid 19 infected so far about 100000 with many untested. My parents are in their 80s. If I bring it to them I would feel terrible. The mortality rates for the elderly is higher. I am glad you will have fun but let’s not blow this off.
"Agreed obtoberitaly. And...its just beginning.Cozumel is not the issue...its the coming/going.Edited: 8:32 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I understand your concern. At this point, Cozumel is running as usual. No reported cases. You need to do what makes you feel good. I hear over and over about hysteria but to those with compromised systems it can and is crucial to protect themselves. At that point, it isn't hysteria but self protection. We've traveled through a few other scares and immediately after 9-11 and never gave it a second thought. My husband is having major health issues at this point without true diagnosis. It isn't caving to the hysteria but our travel plans are on hold to protect HIM."
Yes my primary concern is what if the border gets locked down between my arrival and departure.
"Same here. Leave Monday.Edited: 4:40 pm, March 07, 2020 "
Border get locked down- what do you mean? Or are both of you worried about being quarantined when you get back? My work is making us register all travel with them- well they have cancelled all work related travel- and then they decide if we have to self quarantine or are allowed to come back to work.
I drank 4 Corona‘a today and I feel fine. Should have switched to IPA
"Haha rand too funny.So let me understand, you are afraid that if you leave your country, you are afraid that they will “lock” the borders and not let you come back to your country."
Hey - at least you will be on the fun side of the Republican Wall. ;)
Rand I appreciate you fighting the good fight to clear the Corona nameYes this is serious but you either laugh or cry.
"""Yes my primary concern is what if the border gets locked down between my arrival and departure.""Tell me which countries have travel to the USA stopped. I have not checked but China should be one. Iran likely.There bare roughly 35 other countries with more cases of this hysteria virus than Mexico. Name the one with a ""border"" closed meaning no air travel to the USA from that country.At some point more countries may have travel to the USA suspended but it is going to be far more cases than reported so far for Mexico and you should have some warning of it coming.As for 80 year old parents, they should be protected. Will you stop going to work? To the grocery store? To the hardware store? To a department store. If you live with them (or them with you) then you may have to self-quarantine totally until the virus and yearly flu are not present.This virus event is dominated by hysteria, media sensationalism and politicization."
Well said CoPilot
"Sam-Fun side of any wall is better than the cold and rain! Republican or Democrat, the virus is here and I commend both parties for doing all that they can to control this. If you think you have anyway been exposed to it.....STAY HOME!"
Exactly Copilot. Well said.
Our plan is to head to Cozumel from DFW one week from today...I know the hysteria is likely to be much higher by then but I'm hopeful that air transportation isn't shut down...I too would rather be in laid back Cozumel...especially with little to no cruise traffic than in T-town. Just hope cooler heads prevail at least in Texas until we leave. :-)
"We're here right now. Couldn't help but kinda laugh at the few people on the flight wearing surgical masks and even painters masks! Neither of which are going to be at all effective in preventing the wearers from contracting Covid. Anyone who is buying N95 masks should think of the consequences of creating a supply issue at hospitals, where they are absolutely critical. The island is as great as ever. Enjoy your time."
ShawnWe were in the 2pm arrival on Southwest. There was a Delta arrival a few minutes ahead of us

"Some in the media and social media are staring to ""travel shame"" folks that are traveling."
"I totally relate to the stresses. I'll preface this by saying I have a certain level of anxiety ANYWAY. I am always in some sort of panic, especially right before travel. I use others as a way to gauge how justified my panic is, so as you can imagine this virus has me all up in arms. I want to be sensible. I don't want to miss out on a fun trip but I also am feeling nervous about being far away from home and dependent on restaurants for food if there were to be more of a panic in Cozumel. We are supposed to fly in on Tuesday. I was doing fine until today and I went down the rabbit hole. We are healthy and well, and I am not necessarily worried about getting the virus I guess so much as just being away from home and in a foreign country in a time when everyone is panicking. Anyway, sorry for the ramble, and if I come off as too paranoid, or not paranoid enough. Just voicing my stresses and looking for voices of reason. Man I would be really sad to miss out on this amazing trip!"
"Just wondering if anyone chose's not to fly, will their flights be reimbursed? Not that I have a trip planned, but I sure wish I did. As of today, 13 presumptive positive cases of the virus in Louisiana. My daughter is a nurse and a doctor from New Orleans called her today and said their are also 2 doctors on quarantine. Wasn't nervous at first, but getting a little shaky now! This could possibly destroy the economy."
United is allowing people to take credits. Not sure about change fees.My work will quarantine me if I travel. So not worth it for me. Your decision may be different.
United is not charging change fees.
"Just checked airfare out of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Still high as a giraffes ""you know what"". No deals on airfare out of Louisiana. Sooner or later they will have to drop their prices!"
"For our flight dates in May American Airlines, as of this morning, are showing $415 round trip PP Dallas-Fort Worth to Cozumel. That's down from $667.FINALLY a reasonable air fare!Of course we already have our flights booked. Dang it! Same thing happened when we had our flights booked months in advance for our trip in 2009 and then it happened. The 2009 Media Swine Flu Fiasco LOL. Again we won't save any money.Edited: 7:51 am, March 12, 2020 "
United and Southwest have been hovering around $335. for a couple of months from San Antonio to Houston to Cozumel. That's already such a good price that I don't expect them to go any lower.
I saw yesterday that flights from BWI to Coz were $339 which is an awesome price. That was for this Sat. Wish I could hop on a plane and get away from the hysteria but I don't have enough vacation time :o(
Kristi weigh your options i.e. r/s flights etc. No virus problems here now but much discussion about interfacing with lots of people and crowds. Reasonable anxiety I'd say.
"DeepseaDvr - I agree with your logic...plus many are saying the Chinese actually may have created this one in a lab...Anway, we still hope to fly on the 17th from DFW to Coz and spend 4 nights on the east side of the island away from what would have formerly been ""crowds"" of cruise ship tourist. We are likely safer in that location than at home...and as in this European ban, POTUS will likely give us time to get home if flights south of boarder are limited....which we don't expect right now unless they have a big boom in cases."
Can you please update your trip? What it is like at the airport and at the resort as I am leaving in April. Thank you
"Shawn, please update regarding your trip as i am leaving in April to Cozumel. Thank you"
"The big unanswered question is how many people are being tested in Mexico? Mexicos medical infrastructure is not as good as United States and here in the USA we are hitting roadblocks. Cozumel is a small island that doesnt have a great hospital or medical services. Cancun is a better option if you were seriously ill. The other thing is on any given day mexico also has to deal with the flu, dengue fever, chikungunya, tb and zik. My bet is coronavirus is underreported in Mexico at this stage. Just my opinion though.Edited: 4:45 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I'm suppose to fly out to cozumel in a week. I'm monitoring the situation and at the moment, planning on flying out."
I have a flight booked as well....still not sure if Im gonna go.
"Currently in Cozumel - March 14, taxi driver informed us today that the current cruise ships in port today will be the last ones to arrive for the foreseeable future, it will be a really difficult time for the ppl of Cozumel...to adapt saying that I understand the rationale behind it ..."
Good god people what is your issue? This is a pandemic. Stop traveling. Sorry your vacation was cut short or cancelled but that’s the deal. Move on and come up With different plans Don’t be a vector to spread to other people
"Why wait for a ban when all the authorities are advising against unnecessary travel? Don’t be selfish, heed the advice so as to avoid exposing not only yourself but others too. It takes both an individual and collective effort to try to limit the spread of the virus.https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…@41: the US handling of this has been pretty much disastrous until now. Canada, with 1/10th of the population has done more testing than the US.Edited: 4:20 pm, March 14, 2020 "
anyone actually in Cozumel at the moment and can report on the situation? are restaurants open?
"Yea we have been in Cozumel for 3 weeks as of posting everything is open, no sign of COVID 19 here ...other than the cancelations of the cruise boats from the US ...everything seems normal.. hope this helpsPS have a lovely dinner last night at Kinta a little expensive for or the Mexico but well worth itEdited: 12:11 pm, March 15, 2020 "
thanks Julie
We've been here over a month. People worried about economy. This event basically moving Coz into low season a month ahead of time. Canadians scrambling to get home and being gouged by airlines. It's a pretty anxious time for everyone.
"Yes business as usual except no cruise ships as of today, will any show up on Monday I do not know, everything seems fine"
"How are the grocery stores, my BIL just got back from Grand Cayman and was shocked when he went to the grocery store yesterday and the shelfs were totally empty. Anyway, hope all are well in Cozumel!"
We just extended our vacation on Cozumel for at least another week . It's safe and everything is open. Toronto on the other hand....
No cruise boats in Cozumel for the foreseeable future
"OMG it’s Sunday, of course there are no cruise ships, there never is. Relax. Pretty quiet here, a blessing, pretty sad though. Mega was very slow, but again it was Sunday. Property manager reporting lots of cancellations."
There have been Sunday ships. We know several couples who are heading home to Canada early. Other rental owners are experiencing cancellations. It will indeed be a difficult economic time for this island.
"So yes cruise ships are never in Cozumel on Sunday but they have suspended all future cruise ships leaving the USA which is a huge impact on Cozumel ... Cozumel welcomes a minimum of 5 ships a day from the US .. so none are arriving on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday etc for the foreseeable future ... huge impact of the ppl/ families working/ living in Cozumel .… I understand the rationale but feel for the ppl of Cozumel"
"We are scheduled to leave Tuesday but my spouse is getting cold feet and is worried that we could be stuck in Mexico...personally I don't have an issue with that, but I have to do what the boss says...plus some of my family are worried about same...mostly about the reaction to it and our inability to get back if it worsens (i.e. the reaction). Bummed, if we don't go...still playing it by ear in my mind, but I think she's made her's up. Not a big deal considering my kids are worried about their jobs with American and an MLB team...also due to the reaction. Hopefully expedia and American will refund or credit if we don't end up going. Anyone have experiences with either in the past few days?Edited: 11:57 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Yes. AA will let you change your flight, no fees, to be used by Dec. 31. I did it.Edited: 6:51 am, March 16, 2020 "
"One thing about AA. When I called about a week ago, I had to leave a call back number. They called back about 4 hours later, but they called. Now, online, I cant get anywhere, the timeout thing just spins and spins. What I'm saying is it will take a while for a contact."
We are on the island now and the last cruise ships left on Saturday. Many of the beach clubs are closed due to lack of business. The island is going to be hit hard by this economically.
"Lisa, yes the last cruise ships left Saturday, none were scheduled to be in port yesterday, as most Sundays. And yes the beach clubs were closed, they mainly cater to cruise passengers. Now if there are no ships today, that is a different story. We are south of town, so don’t know. Will find out from our dive company"
Regarding AA- We have a friend who was supposed to travel to France on June 1st. He bought travel insurance. AA is not offering him a refund or vouchers for future travel...only if he's hospitalized.
THere is one ship in port and one due tomorrow. After that I’m told no ships for 30 days.
I'm surprised they're allowed to disembark.
"I can' t blame American...of course my son in law works for them...Expedia is also not interesting in letting me cancel the hotel...which may be on the hotel...not sure. I certainly fell for them..we may still go, what the situation on the island? Are things open...on east side? IN town?"
RE: AA and refunds. My brother was a pilot for AA for 28 years. Even though I've enjoyed many non rev flights...I DO blame them. Relatives or friends working for anybody holds no water with me.
From other thread Buccano’s Beach Club closes. Others will follow. Travel should be shut down.
"If you don't think it's shut down now I've got some ocean front property in Arizona. Not only travel, but the airline and hotel industry and pro and college sports and all gatherings above 50 people...people who work at venues that make low wages, waiters, small business owners and EVERYONE sans healtcare is at risk of losing their jobs if this goes on more than a few weeks (not months)...My son lost his job at an amusement park and my daughter is worried about hers in MLB, son in law may also lose his with American Airlines, but by all means...continue this war on our economy along with this virus. Why don't we do this for more deadly things, like the flu, car accidents, suicide (which by the way will rise substantially as this attack on our economy continues). May God bless the island of Cozumel and all who reside and travel there. Health and happiness to you all."
FYI the Coronavirus tracker is up https://www.bing.com/covid
I wont suggest you to come.. i live on the island and they dont even have tools to do test ....mexico is hiding and not reporting coronavirus cases. They are afraid of loosing tourism. We had cruise ships that came here and now those passengers are found to be infected with covid19
American is offering credits . I just cancelled my flight and will get credit to use for the next 8 months( when I bought original ticket). They are not offering refunds
Yes. I did the same.
We are supposed to leave Friday morning from the US getting into Cozumel about 1 pm. We stay for 6 nights at an all-inclusive resort. Is the island still up and running? We planned to not leave the resort. Thoughts?

"Paradise769602,the news is everywhere that travel is discouraged. My thoughts, be smart and stay home."
If you go you could be bringing the virus into Mexico or you could be taking it back to Nebraska. Be smart and not selfish. Stay home.
Stay home. Don't put others at risk. We can all go once this passes.
Paradise is from Wisconsin....Me....from Nebraska and taking the news seriously.
Agreed...thanks for the input
Thanks for catching my error Jeanne.
We are in this together froglegs55!
People have lost their minds with ridiculous panic. The Wuhan virus is not worse than the influenza flu. We are not all going to die. FACT you are more likely to die from regular old infuenza flu than Wuhan flu.I am going to Cozumel and will try to post what I see on the ground Friday March 20 to this thread.....If I am still alive.
"Oh thank you for spreading any coronavirius germs to others who might take it home to their elderly parents and/or immune compromised loved ones. No, it's not panic....it's good sense. No, we're not all going to die...but some will."
"We are leaving on Saturday for Cozumel and would like to know if we should still come since it sounds like there are a lot of places that are closing due to lack of business. I would like to know if local businesses will be open, local restaurants, if downtown is still open, etc. I don't have a problem is beach clubs are closed,"
"QuarterBack no need to post on my account. Plenty of places to find out ""whats on the ground"". It hasn't really kicked off on Coz, so it seems(no testing), but you could very well get it going, for them. Stay home and go later, like the vast majority of us are doing."
"As a medical professional, I can assure you that the common flu and COVID-19 DO NOT present the same threats . Just look at what's going on around the world. If the emotional and financial investments in your vacation are more more important to you than your health and that of others, by all means go. Personally, having the cloud of the virus hanging over me would prevent me from enjoying my vacation."
I can't imagine putting my vacation as a priority over the health and well being of others. Think beyond yourself.
"Well said CoRedtop! My dad is in a nursing home and he means WAY more to me than a vacation! Do I need a vacation? Hell yeah, but it can wait."
"Crissy, we are here now. At one point, we considered staying for weeks past our return flight. We are going home on Sunday or Monday now. There are increasingly fewer options available to leave. It's one thing to choose to stay. It's entirely a different scenario to be forced to. While things are still fine here (though with a very noticeable slow down) it can change incredibly quickly. I would honestly advise anyone who is not here now, not to come."
Thanks for great advice
"Thank you Shawn, I greatly appreciate your honesty. I've been trying for the last 3 days to get through to the airlines without success to cancel our flights. Any advise on how to handle? I know it's just money, but $3K is a lot for us to loose."
Crissy- Can't you make a change online?
"Crissy, when I postponed, it took hours for a call back. But they did call back (American). Hopefully you can at least get that far, to leave a number.If not, I could have gone online, and cancelled, as froglegs suggests. I would feel confident cancelling, then applying for your refund. There is language on their about rescheduling. I could not have cancelled, but they allowed me to postpone.All else fails, I'd contact my cc company. I know its probably past time for a dispute, but they are all making allowances. Let us know how it turns out, will ya? Good Luck!"
"THANK YOU!! And thank you for those of you that aren’t jumping to condemning people for just asking questions. I’ve been on hold with Delta for 2.5 hrs now. I tried the online route, but for whatever reason, the system isn’t allowing me to change/modify/cancel. Looks like I get to listen to their “awesome” music for a while longer...sweet!Thanks again, and I’m praying everyone stays safe and infection free!!"
Can't you leave a call back number with Delta?
"Crissy I just called Delta. Their very first message says that even if you can't get through, rest assured they will process all changes and cancellations. That sounded good!I did not get a ""leave a number"" message, it went right to the booking menu. Probably once a person says cancel, they'd end up holding...like you are. I cant decide for ya, but I would catch them, later. They also said you can go online, perhaps that will work for ya soon."
"Been there before with American. App, call in, web site. None of it worked during the high volume time at Christmas 2018 when the tornado hit Dallas/Fort Worth and we were trying to get home from San Diego.Edited: 12:48 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"We are in Cozumel now. It is amazing and Corona free. Not only that but hotels are taking many precautions to keep Cozumel that way. However, I can not predict the future. Keep an eye on Cozumel during the time before your trip to make sure it stays corona free. That’s what we did and we are having an amazing time."
So glad it's nice and you're having fun!! IMO Cozumel is NOT virus free. That's just what I think after cruise ships have recently been there and the fact that there isn't even any testing available there. Carry on....
"All of you have been so gracious...thank you! Luckily I'm able to work while ""jammin"" to the rockin tunes Delta's phone system has been playing...been over 5 HOURS now!! I have tried the online Delta system various times over the past couple of days. It walks your through until a certain point, and then just freezes...I just think it's sooo overworked/flooded with requests, it's not letting me do anything. I have faith that everything will work out the way it should. Thank you again for all your kindness and help! My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone to stay safe from this crippling virus. We will persevere (just like my phone on hold time)!!"
"Send them an email. Either on their site, or to a Delta web address(I prefer this way so you have a copy). Keep a copy of course. That way, you have proof of trying to contact them. I would not worry, they certainly led me to believe that they are aware, and are going to take care of you."
"Some guy in Ohio just traveled to the Yucatan and Cozumel and has COVID 19, doubtful that it's not in Cozumel. It's everywhere in the world at this point, just not tested yet. Mexico is likely ground zero for the virus as they are still pretty much a 3rd world country for the most part."
how was your trip?? we are supposed to leave on sunday and freaking out a bit
"Lyn you might want to checkout the Facebook page Cozumel4you. It’s a public site so you don’t need to be a member. They are listing things like beach club closures, restaurants to take out only, the Mega reportedly does not have hand sanitizer. Some of the diveops are closed. United appears to not be flying there in AprilI Would also be concerned about you bringing coronavirus to them."
Crissy...do you live anywhere near the airport? You did not add where you live on the forum. Sometimes that works...I have done it a couple of times when things were a mess! Usually Delta tells you the wait time and asks if you want a call back. But imagine they are way too busy to even consider that method now.
I heard from my maid that the airport is closed and also the barcos are no more. not sure if she meant the ferry or cruises. I am in Bali!
How are things going down there or are you back?
If you are considering leaving the US.....Politico is reporting that a Level 4 Travel Warning is coming for the UShttps://www.politico.com
"It’s official, the US just announce level 4 Travel advisory. This advisory is not a ban on travel however it does state with very strong verbiage that if you don’t return to the United States Soon you may be forced to shelter in place where you are now and the US will not get you out if you choose to stay"
Border news....https://www.msn.com
I would expect Canada might though obviously sheltering at a 4 or 5 star resort in Cancun or Playa is far better than going home and getting infected. I know I was forced to extend my vacation a few years ago in Playa Del Carmen when my area was hit by a hurricane and the airport shut down. I was glad at the end of the day to be in Mexico as opposed to dealing with chaos back in the US.
I’m talking to a friend who has been there for the last 6 months. He hasn’t heard of anyone contacting the virus. Just be safe!
"I am so sad. WHY are people SO selfish? I don't get it. STAY HOME. JFC. STAY HOME. I thought SO much better from Colorado. But i am sorry The largest group I have seen, wantng to come in and spread the virus are Coloradoans. So again, I am so so sorry."

"We are in Cozumel now and the economy is very slow but all the markets and restaurants (except for one I saw) are open and the downtown central is alive and well making it a nice time to be here. Everyone has to make their own decision compute their risk for traveling during this global pandemic and these are my thoughts that lead to the decision of not cancelling my trip:First there are no cruise ships in Cozumel for at least 45 days which significantly lowers the risk of transmission. Secondly if you compare the number of cases in the US to Mexico, the United States has almost a 100% more confirmed infections than Mexico (based on this website below) Of the 118 confirmed cases in Mexico they are centered on Mexico City where the population is very dense and it started by a traveler returning from Italyhttps://tinyurl.com/tlzrb9bIf you look at the number of cases in the US and geographic dispersion I believe you are at a higher risk than being in a place like Cozumel. Americans also travel more often than Mexicans creating more potential for the virus to spread. I live in Colorado and from people traveling to Vail from around the world 40 cases were confirmed causing Vail Resorts to end their season earlier, the town I live in (Highlands Ranch) also has the most confirmed corona virus cases out of any town in oud county. So am I better off being here in Cozumel or being in Colorado right now? Of course though not everything is perfect and I had to think about my strategy, first I made sure not to connect through Mexico City and get a direct flight to Cancun, secondly we have to question how accurate Mexico is counting confirmed virus cases and then what would happen if a travel ban goes into effect and I’m unable to return home with my family? After thinking that through and reading up on it, its Mexico not the US that wants to close their borders because it’s spreading at a faster rate in the US. I’m also very confident the trump administration is not going to stop travel from Mexico given the low number of confirmed cases. Someone in in a earlier post mentioned this link below about travel bans but it mentions noting about Mexico. https://tinyurl.com/yxu65tjw So to summarize this, the folks that are saying it’s not worth risking your health traveling to Cozumel could very well be at a higher risk living in the United States as it continues to spread with the rate of global travel. If I learned that Cozumel is confirming cases of this virus then that would be a different story and would be in the car heading to the airport with my family. But being here for the last two weeks it’s a safe and relaxing place to be, especially if you like diving.Edited: 3:13 am, March 20, 2020 "
I don't see how you can compare no cases on the island to so many cases in the U.S. Hello?! Cozumel has no testing yet!!! I believe the virus is on the island but just hasn't been reported yet.
"Duncan you are sadly mistaken. How many cruise ships have been there in the PAST 45 days, any idea? Some people would say your attitude is very selfish, and you could very well be contributing to the spread of this virus. Its all about you, and your diving, right? SMH"
"The humane thing to do, is not to think of yourself, but think of others. What if you are non symptomatic but have not yet started to display symptoms? What if you are a carrier, and spread this horrible virus to ppl down here? While you might be right it may currently be safer down here than back home, don’t be selfish... stay home!We are lucky, we have tickets to get out of here Sunday evening, which is when we were leaving anyway. Keep safe everyone! Peace!"
"Yesterday the govt here in coz ordered bars, restaurants closed by tomorrow. Our friends here are calling it no season not low season. Very bad for all. Delta was easy to work with this am. Switched our return to tomorrow with no hassle. Even tho our original flight still shows ok I'm not trusting anyone but my gut! I'll day it again. Stay home"
"Trump announced closure of US northern and southern borders tonight at midnight. Essential travel with credentials( cargo, food) will be allowed. Individuals attempting to enter the border illegally will be arrested and repatriated. He said he was working with Mexico on this. Also Pompeo was on and again strongly advised all US citizens who are abroad to return home immediately or else be prepared to stay where they are at for an indefinite amount of time."
Wow!
"Y'know, Now that I think about it, being stuck on Cozumel isn't the worst thing that could happen to Sam. just sayin'."
"This is as serious as it gets folks! I am a Respiratory Therapist and if we as a profession are worried, you should be too! Go home and shelter in place."

Banned cruise ships for 30 days
I live in Cozumel. There are no cruise ships coming at this time and no recorded cases of Covid-19. Also no hoarding of food. Most of us are practicing Social distancing nevertheless.
Fish mama is testing available for Covid19 in Cozumel?
"I just returned from Cozumel because the airport was closing or at least flights from US were not coming in after Sat 3/22/20. The last cruise ship on the Island was last Tues and only because it was at the end of a 14 day trip. Many things on the Island were closing down including ferry to and from down to every 2-3 hrs the beach parks, restaurants and stores due to so few tourists and not sure how it will be in a few months. There were no known cases on the Island and to answer your question no cruises were coming at least for a month at the present time. We hated to leave 5 days early but unsure how long the hotel would even stay open. They were already hurting due to the amount of cancelled trips and No cruises but they too will recover and sure hope u can make your trip"
Cruise ships are banned there were 3 on 3/14 1 on 3/16 at the end of a 14 day cruise and that was the last one for at least 4 weeks. So there are NO cruises there now until the ban is released. They were also testing allPassengers before departing on those last few ships.

Cozumel has banned all cruise ships for 2 months. A friend of the family lives there.
Not true. We were in Cozumel when all of this Covid virus peaked. We landdd on the 29 of Feb for 2 weeks in an Airbnb and flew out as scheduled on March 14 and the day before they had banned cruise ships from docking.
"""We were in Cozumel when all of this Covid virus peaked.""Sadly, the virus hasn't peaked here yet. I just read that the Latin American World Health Organization predicted yesterday that the peak will hit this area 3-6 weeks from now."
Actually they halted cruise ships last month.
"Actually Cozumel halted cruise ships last month.Edited: 9:00 pm, April 10, 2020 "
how concerned?
"Well, I attempted to reschedule our May 24th trip but United stated that the flight has not been cancelled and they will not allow changes unless the flight is cancelled. My issue with this is what if the flight is still a go but the hotels on the island are NOT a go.... NO, didn't get insurance and I don't need a lecture about it. Thanks in advance. Ha!"
"I don't understand why they are being this way with you. Was this through a phone call or an attempt on line to change the flights?From United's web site:""Changes to your travel plans: To help with the uncertainty around future travel — be it summer vacations, conferences, events and more — customers now have until April 30 to make changes to, or cancel, any travel they have booked through the end of the year without fees. This is in addition to existing waivers already in place. If you decide to cancel your flight, you can retain the value of your ticket to be applied to a new ticket without a fee. These travel certificates are now valid for 24 months from the date they were issued. This includes all currently valid travel certificates and all new ones issued on or after April 1, 2020."""
It was a phone call and I made the call after reading their guidelines. I was a bit miffed to say the least.
No one should be doing international travel until there is a vaccine for this!!! Stay the Eff Home!
Also as someone who has family in Cozumel stay away! There are only 5 ventilators on the whole island they are not prepared to help anyone who gets sick!
"""No one should be doing international travel until there is a vaccine for this!!! Stay the Eff Home!""Cozumel, all the caribbean, for that matter will be bankrupt if people wait 18 months to two years to travel. Heck the entire world will be broke"
I totally agree and everyone who is planning a trip to Cozumel be sure and get checked for Covid-19 before you go cause the people there sure dont need to get it from any Tourists. They dont have very many people sick with it right now and we dont want to make it worse. We have many Friends down there and the people are so loving and kind.Please get checked before you leave on your trip so as to keep the people safe in Cozumel.Have a great time on your trip and tell Nellie the Lee's said Hi! from Illinois.
"""Get checked""? You mean tested? You have to have symptoms and/or meet a certain criteria before you can get tested."
"""""Get checked""? You mean tested? You have to have symptoms and/or meet a certain criteria before you can get tested.""Excellent point, Frogs.There is, in fact, absolutely no location here in North Texas to just walk up and ""get checked"".I work in an ""essential"" manufacturing plant here in Fort Worth and people are dropping out like flies. A total of 50 went out on Tuesday due to one exposure and they can't even get ""checked"". One death so far here at the plant."
"Here in St. Louis, we can't just go get ""checked"". What IS available here now, within the last couple days, is the Antibody Test. Cost is $195, and $175 for first responders. Results in 24-48 hours. It is given at a lab here, not sure if more than one lab doing it yet.Edited: 8:08 am, April 16, 2020 "
"Duffer just be aware the antibody test has not been validated yet. The results might be inaccurate The NIH is running a study, I applied and have not heard back from them so I guess a bunch of volunteers!"
"October, I'll well aware, thanks. Have lots of time to research things, these days.And even if antibodies are found, they don't know if that actually means a person won't get it again, or be immune, for how long. All being studied, being so new, its tough to fly by the seat of their pants."
"Look, I understand the situation. My biggest issue with this whole thing is the models are soooooo far off and wrong that we have shut down the entire world for a light flu season.... Ya, Ya, Ya, I know, I know... But if CZM is open, WE ARE GOING and tipping huge. Even a vaccine won't fix this because, like most RNA viruses, they mutate. So as soon as we get a ""vaccine"" the virus will mutate. So next, we will have a good 5 year period of time where they will still be trying to catch up like they do EVERY stinking year with the Flu Virus. It only works half the time if we are lucky. So, Cozumel or any other place where people may go for vacation can either open up and risk it for the next five years and live some what normally or simply shut it down for the next 5 years and die a slow death. This has nothing to do with being selfish it has everything to do with what exactly do we want to live like. Fearful recluses or just move on. I mean think about it, what are the options? Sit at home for a damned year, hell why we are at it, how about we just stay home period. We can get everything delivered. Eh, screw it, off my soap box. HA!!!"
"Sawyersdad if you really want to help Coz, buy gift certificates in advance to places you know you will visit but can’t right now. My next trip, whenever that is, will be full! And will still tip well."
""" simply shut it down for the next 5 years and die a slow death.""It won't even be a slow death for most places in the Caribbean, it will be a rapid bankruptcy."
"Just spoke with El Coz. Looks like they will be closed until mid June. We will reschedule. Everyone stay safe. Sorry I went all nuclear last night, I am just frustrated with this situation."
"Being a long time resident of Cozumel,the best result of Cornoavirus in CZM will be for the reefs. Please be kind, donate to the various charities. The wonderful people of Cozumel need all the help we can give them."
I am booked June 10th and keeping fingers crossed
"I enjoyed your post Sawyer , wasnt even close to a good rant . Just spoke the truth ."
"Well, we are also planning on going at the end of July for a few days. hoping things have settled down a little by then! hoping to get some diving in and see what has changed under water now that mother earth made the whole world take a break. :)"
"Dont recall if it was this thread or not , But Ga was being discussed and many were fearful they opened too soon. Evidently not , numbers are going down steadily ."
What is your source Dan? The Georgia Department of Health data has not been updated. Since May 4.
"Dan, you might want to read this article in the AJC. Looks like a hot mess regarding data collection, reporting and dissemination of data. It looks more like a case study in how not to as opposed to how to report epidemic data. https:/…Edited: 11:52 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"The AJC is a political operative. You can choose to trust what they say or not . But its a very biased operation , sometimes in the extreme. Search Ga Covid 19 graph .. I couldn't get it to link but the numbers go up and down but the 12 days from May 3rd to May 15th look near EXACT to April 9th thru April 21st . Try this link scroll down to COVID 19 OVER TIME .. Blue and red graph , Thankfully shows the numbers dropping off sharply ."
LINK : https:/…covid-19-daily-status-report
Again last confirmed number is May 4th. Others are predicted.
Georgia's numbers are not going down.https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-health-de…
"The classic response from a fixed mindset is to dismiss and discredit anything that challenges our belief system instead of critically analyzing information that challenges our mindset. I'm sure there's nothing I could say to change that fixed mindset in folks, but for those who are open to looking at the information, I'll share a few points:1-Any data shown for the previous 14 days is incomplete and can't be used to make any definitive conclusions regarding increases or decreases in infection or death rates. This is because of the way the GA DPH is counting data and it can take up to two weeks for data to come in. It also shows a shifting in how they count infections based on either when symptoms occur, when the test results come in, or when it received results. This means results show cases are declining even if they are not during that 14 day window. . 2-The GA DPH has used a map color coded in red or blue based on local rates of infection. Recently the DPH raised the infection rate cutoff that pushes a county into red. Based on the ""old"" standard a third of the state's counties would still be showing red. 3-Both the DPH and the Governors Office in recent days and weeks have issued statements apologizing for the continued errors in reporting and displaying data as it has led to confusion and misinterpretation of reported data.4-If you look at the DPH website that was linked in post 167 it states very clearly under the ""COVID-19 Cases over Time"" chart the following: ""* 14-day window – Confirmed cases over the last 14 days may not be accounted for due to illnesses yet to be reported or test results may still be pending."". At the top of the DPH page it also lists an apology on May 17 for an error that resulted in a decrease in positive cases between reporting periods. Look, I am just as ready to be done with this and really really really hope that things improve and that we get some good news regarding decreases in infection rates. My issue here is more a definitive and misleading statement was made and a conclusion drawn by using incomplete data. If, over the next month we start seeing infection rates drop from various measures then I'm all for copying the success of others. Until then I think it's important that we try to be good stewards of data analysis and responsibly use that data in public discourse."
"Well there is an agenda for finding as many positive cases as can be counted . This can be true and you can still belief the disease is deadly and to taken seriously. Its the unequal application of the approach that really irks me . The govt has unwisely chosen winners and losers in the "" who can stay open"" game. And many many have suffered dearly from it . Just my opinion but some media seem to relish the doom and gloom side of reporting and want the economic damage to continue . But like the guy said , I'm not changing any minds , neither is he. And the "" data"" from "" science "" is sadly political science 101 in far too many cases . Carry on my TA friends ."
"Numbers in Ga are down . Preliminary , permanent , reported , guessed at ,, they are down . Just like I personally thought."
"Good read from a Doctor that testified before congress : Not everyone thinks the USA handled this viral outbreak correctly . Me included . Coronavirus lockdowns may be ""killing"" just as many people as the virus because many people with serious conditions unrelated to the virus have been skipping treatment, Hoover Institution senior fellow Dr. Scott Atlas said Saturday on ""Fox Report.""""I think one thing that's not somehow receiving attention is the CDC just came out with their fatality rates,"" Atlas said. ""And lo and behold, they verify what people have been saying for over a month now, including my Stanford epidemiology colleagues and everyone else in the world who's done this analysis -- and that is that the infection fatality rate is less than one-tenth of the original estimate.""CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWEven White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci is acknowledging the harm caused by the lockdown, Atlas said.""The policy itself is killing people. I mean, I think everyone's heard about 650,000 people on cancer, chemo, half of whom didn't come in. Two thirds of cancer screenings didn't come in. 40 percent of stroke patients urgently needing care didn't come in,"" Atlas said. ""And now we have over half the people, children in the United States not getting vaccinations. This is really what [Fauci] said was irreparable harm.""""And I and my colleagues from other institutions have calculated the cost of the lockdown in terms of lives lost,"" Atlas said. ""Every month is about equal to the entire cost of lives lost during the COVID infection itself. This is a tragic, misguided public policy to extend this lockdown, whether or not it was justifiable in the beginning."""
"It’s really ironic and hypocritical that on one hand you categorically dismiss information from the Atlanta Journal Constitution as a “political operative” and then on the other hand you trumpet a report from the Fox Report and a person by the Hoover Institute. Both of these are right leaning and in the case of the Fox Report can be easily categorized as a political operative of the Republican Party and Donald Trump. Digging deeper you will see that the CDC report came out with 5 models for the pandemic progression and what’s being cited by you is the best case scenario. There is still a fair amount of disagreement amongst scientists as to how the pandemic will progress and how deadly it is. There has also been concerns raised as to the methodology and data used by the CDC in creating the report. Maybe the information is right, maybe it’s wrong, but to make broad sweeping declarations as fact is misleading and does us no good. There is still so much we don’t know and are learning everyday so we need to be cautious and investigate more deeply those types of statements. Have we as a country handled this perfectly? Nope. But I think that most of the decisions made at the state level, even if some of the effects of those decisions have disproportionately impacted individuals and businesses, have been made with the right intentions and safety and health of the people. There is no nefarious plot in place to deny people their freedoms or to tank the economy."
The department of public health Georgia shows an increase in cases but prelim data. Thanks NW for your time spent rationalizing with someone who will not see numbers as facts
Ha ha . have a great Memorial Day . Its OK to lower your mask to eat :)
You too Dan!
"""There is no nefarious plot in place to deny people their freedoms or to tank the economy.""Maybe not but if that was not the plan then it was sheer ineptness. The strategy should have been risk-based.1) Provide guidance on medium to high risk (of hospitalization) groups how to prevent becoming infected.2) Protect the vulnerable/frail such as those in nursing homes. 3) The rest of us live our lives normally.This was clearly a media driven politicized event from the beginning in the USA and I am guessing that tens of thousands died because they failed to take any of the steps listed above.Add in the personal tragedies caused by tanking economies around the world and this was a health/economic debacle of unparalleled proportion."
"Why are people talking about Ft. Worth, Illinois, Canada, St. Louis etc.? It's a Cozumel board."
"Copilot, don't think you'll get much argument that there have been plenty of mistakes along the way, though I'd disagree that it's at the level of ineptness. I'd also agree that it has been a media driven event, though if that surprises you, not sure what century you've been living in....lol. Regarding your 3 point plan, I'm not sure how to react, maybe because I don't understand how #1 and #2 don't line up to what has been the guidance already. My guess is you are most upset at #3, but my thoughts related to that......The stay at home orders were designed to A) prevent what we were seeing in other places across the globe like Spain and Italy, where the health system was buckling and in danger of collapse. We saw similar but not near as bad in New York. B) In my opinion-It also was being used to buy time to figure out what we're dealing with. Remember, there was so much unknown at the time; besides the fact that what we were seeing in places like Spain and Italy were a glimpse at what could happen here. We are still learning a lot about the virus including transmission, treatment and mortality. I'd love to hear more specifically what you mean by #1 and #3 because when I think of #1, I think of stay home, if you need to go out then wear a mask, wash hands, social distance and other protocols that have been recommended. #3 is not as easy as you think. There's a pretty significant amount of our population that fits category #1, and it's not like they are already isolated from low risk people anyways as most households probably have a mix of people in group #1 and #3. Not sure what your plan is to address that?As an aside, any chance for reopening our society without huge blowback in numbers relies on people to practice those recommendations from above. Unfortunately, we can't seem to get people to even agree to do small things like wear a mask in public. I am pretty pessimistic in regards to the trajectory of the virus as this country is so fixated on ""me"" and ""myself"" that so many people either can't comprehend the concept of why they need to take these steps for the good of the community, or they don't give a rip. There are lots of people involved in decision-making who are a lot smarter than any of us on TA, and I'd like to think they have what's in the best interest of people and the economy. It's not an either/or scenario. Any easing or tightening of restrictions has a positive and negative effect on both the economy and people's health."

"Sawyersdad, so glad we could provide you with entertainment. You have no idea how long I've waited for your approval or disapproval on what I post. Not sure what political agenda you feel I'm pushing, but to be clear, here's what I believe. I believe that we need to let peer reviewed scientific data drive our decision-making on how we respond to this virus. If I feel that someone is posting/saying something that is not backed up by this type of data, or if it's being presented erroneously, I may choose to speak up. Not to try to change anyones opinion (as that's not going to happen) but to provide more context and challenge that line of thinking.I believe there are no easy answers to how we balance the needs of the health of individuals versus the health of the economy, but if in doubt I will side on the side of health of people. This is not an either/or, or black and white situation, but rather a continuum and decisions made on one side impact the other side.I believe that based on science driven data, we can make decisions on what and how we open various parts of the country and that some businesses are deemed more essential than others. For those impacted by closure, we should provide support for them to help bridge the gap. I believe that individuals should make decisions based on not only what is in their best interest, but also in the interest of others. Sometimes we need to have our individual interests take a back seat to the good of others. Sadly I also believe that many in this country are more concerned about themselves and satisfying their wants and that they don't give a hoot (or give very little) of others. I believe that at the end of the day, the virus is going to decide who is ""right"" and who is ""wrong"" in all these arguments. By that I mean, in the next 12 months while we bicker and argue back and forth about this and that, the virus is going to do what it's going to do and it won't take sides. If we choose to ignore or minimize a lot of the safety protocols and other measures to reduce the spread, these past two months will be a minor blip compared to what could happen. There are a lot more beliefs I could probably share, but I think I've more than exceeded the quota for post lengths today. Hopefully this post measures up to your standards. :-)"

"you didn't miss anything, ol'buddy. ;) sam"
I did not see it but I don’t feel like I missed out. I feel like I was spared having to read it.
I wish it left the user name whose post was removed left up . I wish the board were a tad looser on the moderation. Let people have their opinions as long as our beloved Cozumel or any individual isnt unfairly targeted / slandered -- let people speak .
"More info on the transmission of the virus : Good news showing transmission thru individuals that are asymptomatic appears to be zero , at least in this study . https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32405162/…"
"That study is in asymptomatic hospitalized patient with underlying health problems who tested positive, except that she had worsening shortness of breath so not asymptomatic at all. They then contact traced all her contacts. All of her healthcare team wore n95 and appropriate PPE which if you look at photos from China looks like space suits or even PAPR. The patient wore a mask at all times except eating, the family contacts did also. And no one got it from her.This tells me masks and PPE work. And contact tracing and testing works.This does not say asymptomatic people who are infected don’t spread the disease.I doubt the impact factor of this journal is high and I disagree with the title and your interpretation."
"Not arguing at all but you found some info I dont see listed in the link , where did you see the family wore mask ? Thanks"
"Bottom of page 3 family membershttps://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(20)30166-9/pdfI don’t know if you can access this, it might be behind a paywall I have access to for my work"
"Numbers from Ga still very low . Some cant seem to stand the fact Corona wasnt as bad as originally thought . Should be celebrated but its not. It was deadly for a very very small % of the public . And for that we wrecked an economy that was roaring , Caused so many other problems that the effect might not be seen for many months . Cancer patients missing treatments , routine screenings that catch disease early missed . Severe Depression , all sorts of unintended consequences. But hey , we stayed 6 feet apart in the Walmarts ."
"re 192 Yes, they wore masks but they make it clear why this may have not effective. (below) ""Due to these factors, patients and attendants can only wear one mask for a long time, resulting in its ineffective. Besides, we noticed that some patients and relatives wore PPE incorrectly due to the lack of adequate training,"" If staff had 100% protection at all times from the virus there would be no point in publishing this paper...Also you say ""This does not say asymptomatic people who are infected don’t spread the disease"" but in the paper's conclusion it clearly says : Infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak. Also Respiratory Medicine has a decent impact factor of 3.2. The LAST thing any journal wants to do is let a misleading paper (as you suggest this is) through the cracks.Edited: 2:01 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"Oh Dan. Georgia case numbers are increased again. https://www.13wmaz.com/mobile/article/news/h…And all the other consequences of this are awful but stop denying the data. I have got to work, no lore arguments from me."
"Lol , there is key word right in the headline "" COULD"" Here is the data directly from the CDC website for Ga .. Number of preliminary cases May 21 st 450May 22 392 May 23th 139May 24th 110May 25th 27May 26 17 This is the "" blue dot"" in the graph provided by the CDC ... the orange dot is the 7 days moving average .. again looks like the dow jones on a horrible day .. down down and down . I have a cousin I love , super guy , PHD in community safety , public health official, now a CEO of a nursing home .. But he treats this thing like its lurking on every door knob , like its blowing in every breeze and it kills every person it remotely comes in contact with . Just a drastic over reaction , littered with over the top restrictions that did more harm than good . Georgia has 10.6 MILLION people , and we have people acting like a few hundred cases of this virus is still a big deal . Its not . I swear I think people get addicted to fear. Carry On ."
"And YES , in his nursing home setting EVERY precaution should be taken .. I get that , very clearly . I'm talking overall general populace , not a small subset of our population. Thought I better be clear so I dont get beat up :)"
"I'm sorry but I can't understand how the moderator doesn't close this topic. The backs/forths are very rarely directly related to Cozumel and have become just a game of comment ping-pong based on everyone's limited perspectives and political/personal observations. That's fine, but take it elsewhere. Realize the pandemic impacts us all and not trying to diminish that. But can't we give this a break and limit our opinions /pontificating and observations to things Coz-related? Geez."
"Nothing is more Coz related than this virus IMO... I'd like for the leaders of Mexico / Cozumel to not make the same mistakes the US made. Thats my point in highlighting how the media has overplayed this in SOME circles , not all , but a lot , thing is whats good policy in NYC , or San Miguel might be really useless policy in places just a 100 miles from there . We have places here in Kentucky larger than the island of Cozumel with less than a Total of 10 cases. And those were traceable and easily contained . But we shut down close to 100% of the economy in those ares that were unaffected ? Not good policy IMO."
"The problem with shutting down some areas and not others is that it encourages travel to the 'good areas' that have restaurants and shopping open. Then the virus spreads. The areas in Kentucky that you speak of are lucky to have very few cases and it wouldn't be that way if they opened up before the neighboring areas.Edited: 1:37 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Not sure that logic applies to places that are not touristy, snorkeler? I agree with Dan. My province is doing very well and re-opening things slowly and carefully (as we should be, IMO, the idea was not to shut the economy down until the virus disappears or a vaccine is discovered, after all). But maybe TO should delay a bit more, for example (while other parts of Ontario should be able to re-open, say).Every area/city/region is different. An area that has been successful at flattening the curve shouldn't have to suffer in some sort of weird solidarity with other places that have many more cases- if travel is still limited, why would we do that?"
"Even the media is admitting exactly what I said I many days ago but was met with strong opposition on here :https:/…index.htmlThis virus is yesterdays news in the United States and hopefully will be very soon in the Q Roo.. Yes we had to be very cautious at first , it was an unknown entity . ( Covid) But after a few months the truth of the matter is it was a disease that mainly affected the elderly and weak ( yes I'm aware of the exceptions) but here is the data : 43% of the deaths were from 0.6 % of the general population https:/…I just hate for Coz ' -- I support a family there , his messages this week have taken a dark turn . Farmacia being robbed , 2 doors down from his apt a break in . and without my assistance he says its a strict diet of rice and beans . Thats no way to live. he has 2 beautiful kids as well. I'm pretty confident his story is repeated too often on Coz .Edited: 9:08 am, May 28, 2020 "
"As much grief as I've given you over your posts Dan, I have to commend you for putting your money where your mouth is and supporting a family on the island. It's these kinds of things I hope all can rally around and make the world a better (and safer) place......And now back to our regularly scheduled disagreements. LOL. :-)"
"One person asked why we were discussing this Wuhan flu virus in a Cozumel travel forum. The simple reason is that flawed responses to the virus in the USA and other countries effectively led Mexico to adopt the same nuclear option (shutdown) instead of what I call a risk-based strategy. Because the region’s economy is so tied to tourism, this has likely led to far greater personal crises and individual hardships than in the USA.In post 178 I listed three categories to provide guidance on protective strategies:1) Provide guidance on medium to high risk (of hospitalization) groups how to prevent becoming infected.2) Protect the vulnerable/frail such as those in nursing homes. 3) The rest of us live our lives normally.nwwinelover thought that hand washing, social distancing, face masks etc were the guidance for #1. Good guess but that is not correct. Group #1 are people at medium to high risk of hospitalization if they are infected by the virus. They are also on their own, living with a family member but not in a nursing home or other care facility. They bear the responsibility of taking measures to prevent infection. I won’t go over possible measures since most of you can come up with ideas and the CDC should have promulgated options early on.Group #2 are people at medium to high risk of hospitalization if they are infected by the virus but they are in a care facility. These people may be very vulnerable, frail of health, etc. These people deserved great protective measures to ensure their safety. In many cases this did not happen since a large percentage of deaths “attributed” to the virus were of residents of a care facility.Group #3 is everyone else and we live our lives normally. Follow the early guidance about washing hands, don’t touch your face, avoid sick people and don’t go out if sick. Prudent advice year round and if followed well by most people, I suspect that yearly cold and flu cases would drop substantially.Using my approach instead of the nuclear option of shutdowns allows the economy to stay intact and would have saved thousands of lives…maybe tens of thousands.Even now this fake crisis laments the grim milestone of 100,000 Wuhan flu virus deaths in the USA. That number is wrong. Because hospitals reportedly get lots of money for Wuhan flu deaths, everything is a Wuhan flu death now. I suspect from this alone, the number is about 30-40% too high. Then add in the 30-50% of deaths that were due to someone sending Wuhan flu positive patients back into care facilities instead of a hospital and we are at typical flu season death numbers.I understand that many on this forum are afraid or maybe even enjoy the asinine measures taken to supposedly stop the virus but these measures are killing economies and causing epic hardships for many millions of people. Go buy some Wet Ones, a bottle of hand sanitizer and wear a mask if you wish. Just end these mandates and open everything up. The one caveat is that we have to take care of meeting the guidance and protective measures of groups 1 and 2 above."
"It's been proven, that we don't have enough hospitals, if we just ""open things up"". I guess you just don't want to admit it. What needs to happen? Another 100,000? Would THAT do it for ya? Smh"
"I won't belabor the issue much more but I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. I honestly don't understand how we can keep group 1 segregated from the rest of society, especially group 3, as those groups live together. I know you'll say they need to practice good risk mitigation strategies, but in practicality that means stay at home except for essential purposes. If I'm at medium or high risk that means I probably shouldn't be going to work or in places with lots of other people around to risk exposure. Unfortunately, not an insignificant number of people in this country are in that medium to high risk group for hospitalization. According to the ADA almost 11% of the population has diabetes and almost 8% have asthma (CDC). Prob some overlap, but that's almost 20% of the US population with just those medium to high risk hospitalization factors. If we go through the rest of the risk factors that would classify someone as medium to high risk (morbidly obese, those over 65, heart disease, lung problems like COPD, immunocompromised, those with cancer, etc), I'd argue that even if we controlled for people in multiple high risk categories, we have to to be approaching or exceeding 40% of the US population. Then you factor in those in the 40% group who have people in your Group 3 who live with them, I'd estimate we're at 60% or more of the population. We can haggle over the exact numbers but I state this to just highlight my point, it's not so easy to do what you propose. There's no way we'd be fully open as an economy (yes, some of these folks can work from home, but the nature of the US economy doesn't allow for that for many jobs). And even if we could there's no way people would do what they need to do to help protect those at medium to high risk. Heck, we can't even get people to wear masks consistently to protect others. We can certainly argue about whether these measures were draconian or not, and I agree things could have been done a bit differently, but you and I will probably never agree on what would have been appropriate. Like I said in a previous post, we'll know for sure in the next 6-12 months how ""serious"" this was, as the country is opening us as you want (though not as quickly as you want. But 100,000 deaths is not insignificant, regardless of whether you think that was undercounted (as an aside, the same standards are used with identifying death by flu, so they are comparable numbers). Not sure what you meant in post 207 though.I guess I did belabor the issue much more! :-/Edited: 10:09 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"""It's been proven, that we don't have enough hospitals, if we just ""open things up"". I guess you just don't want to admit it. What needs to happen? Another 100,000? Would THAT do it for ya? You do know that every claim of gloom and doom my Gov Cuomo failed to be even close.They needed 40,000 ventilators. Not even close.Field hospitals and a Navy hospital ship sent to New York City and they were barely used.I have heard that this is the greatest medical calamity in US history. Wrong. It is the greatest media driven hysteria event and subsequent overblown, economy killing and vulnerable person killing event in our history. As for the woe is me concern about this group and that group having to take responsibility for their own safety...that is life. Maybe they can go out with a portable bubble boy suit. Or N95 mask and extensive decontamination procedures. It is what it is. Accept that the onus is on them to do what works.Shutdowns were never needed to the extent they were used."
"""Go buy some Wet Ones, a bottle of hand sanitizer and wear a mask if you wish. Just end these mandates and open everything up.""Agreed co-pilot that the economy is suffering. Do you know where I can find a bottle of hand sanitizer, bleach, mask or any of the PPE? If so, please contact me."
All those are available here in DFW.
"@Co_Pilot Why do you insist on calling Covid-19 ""Wuhan flu"". That attaches an ethnicity to the virus that puts all people of Asian descent at an increased risk."
Hey Shawn....2 guesses.
"It also does not do anything to help a patient get treated. Tell a doc you have influenza you get tamiflu. Tell a doc you have coronavirus it’s supportive care only. Tell a doc you have an illness from a certain city, could be anything as that is not how we classify them."
Are Covid19 numbers really increasing in Mexico City? If so I would guess all of Mexico will have travel restrictions for a while.
Feel good story about my friend in Coz — he said police let him and a couple buddies fish Chen Rio in exchange for picking up trash around the beach — he got a nice grouper
"""Agreed co-pilot that the economy is suffering. Do you know where I can find a bottle of hand sanitizer, bleach, mask or any of the PPE? If so, please contact me.""Hand sanitizer is often available now at my local Walmart but not at normal quantities. Wet Ones are hit or miss. Yours may be different.Bleach is at near normal stocking levels.Liquid hand soap is available.Even the sanitizing wipes are often available but certainly not like they were four months ago.Masks I have no idea. I bought a two-pack of N95 masks early on and they are not fun to wear. I did find a 200 pack of Equate (Walmart brand) nitrile gloves 3-4 weeks ago but they are not my normal Harbor Fright brand so I won't buy those again when gone.I suggest going to your Walmart when they open or just before they close. I seem to get most of my items early in the day. Going before they close is not my preference so I can't verify stocking levels.Edited: 8:50 am, May 31, 2020 "
HiNo they are not cancelling Cruise ships. Here is a link with some good info.https:/…cozumel-coronavirus-news.htm
There's a lot of good info in that link. But I did notice one thing that was not accurate. It said bars are ready to serve guests with the new protocols in June. That's 100% NOT true. Bars and nightclubs cannot open until an area is in the green on the stoplight system. They will be the last places to open.
"Regarding cruise ships, the information regarding dates in the link is outdated. It's highly unlikely that any ships departing from ports in the US will begin sailing again until at least October, especially considering the new rise in Covid cases in many states. The initial plan put forward by the cruise lines to resume operations was deemed to have significant shortcomings by the CDC. If you look at the current Carnival site, most every itinerary including Cozumel does not start until November. https:/…"

"Does anyone know when the Grand Park Royal closed? I see it says they re-open July 1st, but I need to know when they first closed. I would be SO grateful if anyone can answer this."
"It is my understanding from two friends who live on the island, that there have NOT been ANY cruise ships in many months, and I believe they are not permitted at this time. The locals are suffering greatly from this lack of income, although for us divers, it's probably welcome."
Do you know any other info about the island thinking of going later this month but not sure of the conditions and restrictions. Would you be able to help me. Hope so need a beach fix. Tks Kris
"Be aware of Cozumel Tours that was posted back on response # 218 . They are a THIRD person tour company...do NOT live in Mexico...and ONLY appear on the various Mexico forums when things like this virus...or a hurricane happen. Seems they like to get their name out there...and they think that is a good time. They were all over the Cabo San Lucas forum during the last large hurricane...and their information was always a day or two late and a few bucks short! Deal with tour companies that are LOCAL...as in Cozumel....that way the money stays in Cozumel...and if you do use the Third person tour company...keep in mind that your Cozumel guide got low pay from that tour company to do the tour...as they needed to keep the commission. Please deal with the LOCAL guides...especially now...they really need your business.Edited: 5:24 pm, August 03, 2020 "
^Please deal with the LOCAL guides...especially now...they really need your business.^ So very true. This has always bugged me. People aren't always aware that they are dealing with a 3rd party and I cringe every time one is recommended.
"I'm glad someone posted about Cozumel Tours. I assumed they were local and have been referring to their website for updated information. We're planning a trip to Cozumel in November and will be flying into Cancun. Cozumel Tours' website shows a modified ferry schedule, with only one ferry running after 3:00. Does anyone know where I could find the current ferry schedule?"
"We recommend VIP tours with Rogelio narvaez and his group. Known he and his family for 20 years. Carla, his wife sells her baked goods which are outstanding. CK out their website or fb!"
Latest rumor White House officials have been circulating a proposal that would give U.S. border authorities the extraordinary ability to block U.S. citizens and permanent residents from entering the country from Mexico if they are suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus

"""Does anyone know where I could find the current ferry schedule?"" mtreb, Check out Ultramar's Facebook page. They seem to have the accurate schedule."
Thank you!
Ultramar and Winjet post current ferry schedule on Twitter. Not Fb or website btw
Both companies post regular on Twitter.
"""Ultramar and Winjet post current ferry schedule on Twitter. Not Fb or website btw""This is not correct. I just looked at Ultramar's Facebook page and they do list the current ferry times."
"And Ultramar posts and updates ferry times on their website as well. With the changes to their schedule due to COVID, I regularly check the website for ferry times.https:/…routes-and-departures"
Plus lots of people don't do Twitter or Facebook. The website works fine.
