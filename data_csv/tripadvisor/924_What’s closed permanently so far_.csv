"Hearing that Lucy’s is not reopening:( And Loose Cannon and one of the rip off cosmetic stores. Any truth to this, and anything else? Lucy’s makes me sad, I liked the vibe there. Afraid there may be more to come:("
A friend of mine here in Lexington has closed her restaurant down after 35 years....right in downtown Lexington...
K - did you see that on FB yesterday? I don't know the real answer but did see people saying that guy was pulling legs.
"Other than Loose Cannon and Coffee Plantation, nothing is official that I know of. There are some vacant shops on Duval, but I don’t know if they were vacant before. Lots of rumors around, including Lucy’s, but until I hear it from the owner or staff who were told, I’m not going to comment. Unless people no longer travel again, I’m sure most places here will reopen. Unfortunately some will close. It’s difficult to predict the future right now.Edited: 2:32 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"Bluewater- It was in my email today from Amber who runs the Key West’s Finest page. Hoping it’s not true, although I expect some of the newer establishments may really struggle.Edited: 2:50 pm, May 07, 2020 "
Lucy’s just officially announced they are closing for good.
Rip off cosmetic store will re-emerge selling Covid-19 prevention cream which will turn out to be a mixture of baking soda and Clorox bleach.
"Kojin also announced they’re closing. That’s a real loss for me. The lease was up and the landlord wanted double the rent, so would likely have closed without COVID. Landlords in this town better wake up to a new reality soon or they will do more damage than the virus!"
I was sad to hear about Lucy's. I didn't want to believe it until I saw it on their Facebook page. It had become one of our favorite places last year.
"I think some places were possibly on last legs prior to this, I doubt coffee plantation closed because of the lockdown, and as SDT pointed out, kojin is a result of a very greedy landlord and will probably reopen somewhere else, the owner may even try bigger and better since he has a history of trying new ideas and reinventing himself, always with great food. I never was a fan of Lucy’s, very average food and a chain atmosphere to us at least. I actually think the little stores are hurting worse than the restaurants and many will not reopen. We need to see how this all shakes out. I’m not a big fan of doom and gloom."
"We all like (or dislike) places for different reasons. For us, sometimes it's the food, sometimes it's the vibe or the bartenders, etc. Lucy's was just a fun place for us and we met a lot of good people there - some were visitors, some locals and some bartenders. I liked their happy hour, their queso, mimosas on Saturday mornings and listening to Sheldon play on the porch. And I loved the reno they did on the building before they opened on Duval - so beachy. It was in such a convenient spot for us, so easy to pop in for a little bit in between other places. We'll miss it."
"Sheldon and Rob had already stopped playing at Lucy’s prior to the shutdown, they had moved over to Loose Cannon."
"Cruisemom, I absolutely understand.Xaos, loose cannon is also closed for good.I think some of the newer places didn’t have a chance as we were just getting into mid high season when they shut down."
Does Chris Shultz have an interest in Kojin? He always has done a good job and always has great ideas.
We will miss Lucy's. Loose cannon simply picked a bad spot as nothing lasts long with that landlord. Hope not much else leaves.
Will the Sandbar survive?
"Banyon, no it’s not chris."
"I really don't understand the constant berating of commercial property owners in Key West. In the strong majority of cases the complaining post are coming from someone that doesn't have a clue what the terms and lease agreement is between the owner and occupant. The market will determine the monthly lease fee (yes, KW is outrageous) and at the end of the day, the occupant determines if the lease is to high or can be met with their business plan."
"theagent, unless you are a chain, it's pretty hard to survive paying Midtown Manhattan rental prices on Duval Street with a fraction of the foot traffic.I knew it was coming when Fast Buck Freddies closed/moved.Edited: 10:49 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Agent. The owner of the kojin property not only raised the rent but made it retroactive, I don’t know about the others but this is truly outrageous and greedy."
"I guess I can scratch "" beef short ribs at Kojin"" off my immediate future bucket list."
Is a second issue that owners that have more than 1 rental. If they lower 1 then the others learn about it and want lower rates. Being a landlord is not easy as you might think. We also must judge who is going in and if they likely can make it as eviction is slow and costly. I do not understand why someone opens a location that has failed many times. A smart landlord wants a tenant long term such as 5 years or more.Lucy's was fun place to grab a seat the the front bar and people watch. Price and food was good but will assume the rent since Covid closed it down had to drain the bank account. Hopefully will reopen in another Duval location.
"Jim, commercial real estate is different than residential."
We really enjoyed Lucy's last October and made a couple friends there. One of whom is expecting her first child soon. I hope everything works out for everyone.
"I’m hearing that Charlie Macs and Turtle Kraals might also be closed for good. Anyone local hear anything? I can’t imagine TK closing. But, since Croce owns them both as well as a few others, who knows?Edited: 2:42 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"I have heard that from a few people, but it’s a rumor until I hear it from management or staff that has been told. There are lots of rumors about businesses right now. The City is deferring rent at The Bight, so it seems odd TK would close, but who knows... However, I did see that Bliss is closing. She is having a sale this weekend to get rid of all her beer and wine inventory.Edited: 3:17 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"SDT that doesn’t surprise me, a lovely lady but not the best business person. I wouldn’t be surprised if pat croce closed the rest of his businesses, turtle crawls has been just terrible in quality since he bought it."
This is from a KW resident and musician.”The businesses that have now closed in Key West so far : Lucy’s Retired Surfers Bar & Restaurant Fresh Produce clothing store3 gift stores in the Shops on Mallory Square mall Loose Cannon barBeach Club clothingFunky Flamingo Sandal Factory Outlet next to Sloppy Joe’s Kojin Noodle on Southard Street Med MenCharlie Mac'sTurtle KrawlsAnd the Coffee Plantation.”
"Sandal Factory Outlet is currently on LoopNet for rent.$25,000 per month ($104 sf) not including triple net.So you still have to add taxes and insurance to that amount.Taxes alone are $20,000 a year."
Sadly Add Bliss to the list Landlords are going to be left with vacant space when they could’ve worked with the tenants
Sad indeed. I’ve been to many of the closed establishments but none were regular spots for us but the next wave will probably include some favorites. Up here some are starting to close too. It been 8 weeks with no revenue. A well connected restauranteur said they think they will survive until summer but a second wave of closures in the fall will kill most restaurants and small retailers.
"SDT, I heard from a Charlie Macs bartender that they were told Friday that CM and TK will not reopen."
"Thank xaos, I’m sorry to hear that.Edited: 10:18 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Xaos, did you hear that from Timmy?Edited: 11:31 am, May 10, 2020 "
"So sad, we are big Tower Bar fans....we love sitting there for HH, watching the boats go out for sunset cruises. Been going there for decades! I can't tell you how many nice people - locals and tourists - we have met there. Hopefully a new owner takes over Turtle Kraals in its entirety and rejuvenates the quality of the food, which has been sadly lacking for a while."
"Jtwiz, I agree with you. it used to be a favorite of ours to take visiting family and friends but when it became corporate the food quality seriously went downhill."
"""that they were told Friday that CM and TK will not reopen.""Sorry to hear"
"jtwiz, the “rumor” is that The Boat House may go into the Turtle Krawls space. If true and I really don’t know I think that would be great, their food is much better than the recent TK’s food quality in my opinion."
"Xaos, that would be a good move! I agree that The Boat House has better food, including their Happy Hour deals. I think they could do a nice job with the TK space.Valentine, yes, over the years, we too have introduced many friends to the Tower Bar. But sadly, we weren't eating there any more, it had become a drinks stop only. FYI. The longer this all goes on, we are starting to wonder about some of the restaurants and shops in our tourist town. There was a big turnover after Hurricane Sandy, and now I think it will be happening again. It's really sad..."
"The same thing is happening here on our little island here in SW Florida, we have started to hear about some places that are not going to open again. I just hope we don’t have a second wave, it will be much worse if that happens."
Just got off phone with Phil at Curry Mansion and pretty much confirmed The Boathouse will be moving in. As regulars we do not need to worry if US 1 is opened as our deposit will just be moved to when KW does open.Just maybe some of the changes will be for the best. Lucy's will make us sad and do hope re opens in another location. Some might jump on the open spaces in good locations.
"I read a FB message on Sunday that Steve Maciewitz (former owner of Manarro's ) wrote in ""Memory Of Stripes The Cat"" that as many.. as 10 different establishments will be closing in KW. The greed from inflated rates in Hotels & Landlords has to stop or there will be no longer a KW, (as we remember) to go to."
Also hearing that Hogs Breath is closing
I don’t believe that and I haven’t heard that at all
"Hogs Breath in Destin is closing, not KW."
I heard that Hog’s Breath in KW was doing some remodeling during the shutdown.
Based on the volume of business we saw the two times we were in Hogs Breath I would be shocked if they were actually closing. I understand there is a lot more to running a successful business than revenue but it would be shocking if a place with that much business did not have the cash reserve to survive 3 or 4 months. It is also hard for me to believe that out of states have more reliable information than locals.
"From Hog's Breath Facebook page:""Dan & Matt are staying busy during our lockdown with some minor renovations to the front bar! We can’t wait to have ya’ll back once this blows over. Keep your eyes out for some great new content and updates from your favorite Key West hangout! Stay healthy and remember, Hog’s Breath is Better Than No Breath At All! """
"""Hog’s Breath is Better Than No Breath At All! ""I know that's right!"
"We don't much care for HB but been in it a few times. It does seem to stay packed and is partially why only been a few times. As to what will close depends on when they can reopen. As far as greed from landlords this comes down to the value of the building. Yes many places are overpriced in value but a landlord needs a profit on that actual value. It is pushing some places to be too costly for what they are. For us all we really must have is a decent place to sleep. We do not need high end rooms to sleep in. We do need a place to park as we must drive. It is the bottom number we look at. Yes we pay about $100 more a night for location and parking. To us it is worth the added price to get what we actually want. We will all see who can survive for how long. If more than a few months many will likely close. This is nothing new to KW as always someone who wants to give it a try. Been seeing this for 46 years and usually a building gets someone to risk what many others failed to run before them. A smart landlord will try to work something out for this situation, they do not want empty buildings and start a rent war. Chains sadly will be able to hold out better than a small local."
It’s the chains that are closing right now.
I'm wondering why chains would be closing? Don't they have the most in reserves? Or are they just done with the Keys / KW and putting effort into shops or locations where the lock down isn't as restrictive? Seems weird. But I'm not econ expert that's for sure!
"I can only speak from personal experience but at the start of this. The chains shut down but the local businesses continued to do take out and delivery. Locals support locals for the most part and we’re the only ones here. Right now, except for a few, the local places are open within guidelines and we continue to support. I don’t frequent the chains and nor do most of the people I know. Not sure this has anything to do with it, I’m sure it’s wanting to lay off employees etc."
"Some of the chains are franchises vs corporate rune, so someone bought and owns it and pays to use the name, etc. Relying on their own money, not money from corporate."
"That’s true blue, I was thinking specifically of the Croce places, I think Lucy’s was a franchise. I try hard support my friends and neighbors,, Long time restaurant owners and families."
"I hear ya, Val!"
Just read in a NY Times article about Key West that Bliss will not reopen either.
That’s a few weeks old but true. Mamas flowers just announced closing for good
so does anyone have an actual list of all the businesses that have permanently closed in key west?

And southernmost escape is closing as well.
Many more are closing up. You will hear more soon
The Salty Angler is closing. It’s too bad. They had a good local following and some good bands.
I was talking to a real estate buddy yesterday and rents are about to become more affordable on the island which will be great for people wanting to either start up or reopen in the coming months. This will most likely be a long process and both Lobster Fest and Fantasy Fest will take the brunt of the tourism downturn. Many shops on Front Street will close up because the cruise ships are already removing Key West from their future sailings in favor of the Bahamas and Havana as a substitute since they are no longer welcome. Say good bye to that revenue stream! It was only $5 to $10 a person port fee but over time it adds up especially with the larger ships nowadays. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs will be lost as a direct impact of the over reaction to the 100 covid cases with few deaths in Monroe County that mainly were at rest homes. Good Job there on the overkill!
KeyWestGuy- are you saying that Lobsterfest and Fantasy Fest will or will not happen this year? And what is your source?
"They are both on hold. I spoke with the organizer of Lobsterfest,"
Hard Rock is considering closing according to corporate officer I spoke with today
Salsa Loca is closed unless they move to new location according to owner of Cowboy Bills their sub landlord
Bliss is gone for good after an 11 year run

That would be great Valentine. I hope that’s the case. I haven’t had a chance to talk to them but they are really nice people and did so much for the community after Irma. I hope they stay in Key West.
"And FYI, parrot head convention in November has been cancelled."

unfortunately we did loose some business on Duval street. Cowboy Bills is one I can think of off the top of my head.
Cow Boy bills might be closed simply because the distance rule would kill any chance. It just might reopen when this Covid 19 is over. It often was standing room only. It should have made money.
I’ve been told Cowboy Bills is not reopening and neither is Salsa Loca. I guess you never know...
Once upon a time Salsa Loca was one of my favorite places. I'm sad to see it gone (because I remember how it used to be) but not really surprised. It's been many years since we've eaten there.
Cowboy Bills closed for a bit a few years ago and it was Rum Runner. Don't think it lasted a year and he reopened. Can understand closing and just enjoy retirement. It could reopen as any bar. Because of the seating (mostly bar) it would be hard to make it work at a profit. Hopefully he will reopen as it is the only true country bar. Am sure many places are not making a good profit at this time. No bets on when this will change but KW needs to figure something out or nobody will open anything.
"Jim, yes when we figure out a vaccine for covid we’ll let you know, otherwise we need to go by appropriate safety measures and guidelines. I’m not mourning cowboy bills and there are some businesses closed for renovations and making good use of the downtime and others that did have savings to make it through"
"Bill died last year, but had been in and out of the business end of Cowboy Bills over the years. He was not involved with the bar at the time of his death. He claimed to build bars and sell them, but it never did quite work out how he intended. I really liked Bill, but was never in business with him.Years back it was jammed and did really well, but for the last 5+ years it had been on a serious decline. 10 years ago the place was always packed, music all day long. Sexy bullriding on Wed nights, when women drank for free (or was it $1, can't quite remember) was totally insane. I won't get into the particulars, but the bar lost its local love which is the kiss of death in KW. Few businesses here can survive just on locals, but without the support of locals you are guaranteed to fail. (See Backspace) Love Salsa Loca and very sad it's not coming back. But Nancy is like a phoenix, she will rise again!Salty Angler also closed last month."
I am sure when a vaccine arrives it will be on the news. That you didn't support Cowboy Bills is not the the cause of it closing. What concerns me is if your numbers go up what will happen. For now we try to only go to outdoor places as do think that is safer. Am sure with all the empty buildings we will see some new places but likely not till this is over. Am thinking this will be many months or even a year.
"I certainly never implied *my* business had any effect. It was never our spot, but I know a lot of what went on. It had been on a major decline for several years, and when locals stopped going it was very difficult to turn it around. Which is why Chad and Chaz tried to rebrand the bar as Rum Runners, in an attempt to revitalize the space."
"Another temporary closure that surprised me is Tavern n Town. My friend manages a restaurant downtown and a TnT server came in and applied for a job. He told her they weren't going to open until January. Said they were looking at putting a dining space outside by the pool.It's owned by local prominent attorney, which has me wondering if he's afraid of the liability. Normally I run into Robert socially pretty frequently, but since that's on hold I haven't been able to find out more.That space is gigantic, and always very busy. The financial hit must be enormous."
Carol - new restaurant by the pool at Beachside - Chicken something (Chicken shack?) I thought it had already opened.
"Carol and blue, the chicken walk thing by the pool has opened. Tavern and town is not about liability it’s about money. They can’t make it work with 50% at the hotel and 50% at the restaurant. It will open when that caveat is lifted. It’s a corporate entity , Robert does not make those rules by himself. Jim, I was being sarcastic since you told me kw needs to figure it out, I assumed you were putting the cure thing all on us.Hinge come and go here, this too shall pass."
Yes - I was just stating that the chicken place question thing. They have a hotel and restaurant up here too that I have a work relationship with and I used to work with Robert closely. I had a memo that they had opened but Carol had me second guessing on the chicken walk.
"Like I said, I didn't know the whole story. Maybe he meant they were going to expand the outdoor dining space?I wonder if all Marriott dine-in restaurants are closed. I was very surprised to hear TnT was not reopening in the near term."
"Valentine, your reading me wrong. The cure of Covid 19 is not something KW can do. Making it profitable for places is about all KW can do and that would require lower rents that are unlikely. KW has always been a place packing people in to max the square foot of rent. I have no cure for the problem. At 50% few places can survive. We sure could not. This will be a very slow fix so at best use masks. It is sad to see something go down so fast and unlike Irma no prediction on when. It still is a safe place to live and visit. I do think many will reopen by July 1 st."
T&T not planning to open until Nov/Dec. They have cut out contract workers and that's what T&T was.
"Bluewater, I’m sure you are aware that many tavern and town workers are local. Many are homeowners. I know them. The cleaning people for sure but the chef and servers. They are still here."
"""T&T not planning to open until Nov/Dec""What is that?"
"It’s tavern and a town, the indoor restaurant at the Marriott beachside. Very popular with locals."
I'm just saying why they aren't reopening right now. Nothing about people being local or not. It was a contract based restaurant. Where does that say they aren't locals??
"Blue, I’m sorry. I’m not in the business. I guess I misunderstood what that meant."
"SDT, good to know."
Kojin is permanently closed. The owner was incredibly rude to me on my last visit.
"Rezin, I don’t understand the point of your post. Kojin lost their lease, not due to Covid and the owner has moved on . I’ve always found him to be a decent guy. You might want to try the new noodle place that moved in. Maybe you’ll like those owners better."
"And if anyone is interested, the Starbucks on duval and front is closing."
"Have there been any updates to this list? Unfortunately we had to cancel our 1st anniversary trip and postpone our yearly August trip due the quarantine for NY and not sure when we will be able to return. It will be sad to go back and see which of our regular spots are no longer there.Edited: 3:17 pm, yesterday "
No new closures that I know of but there have been new openings
"I'm interested Valentine. While I am always reluctant to be happy about someone else's failure and do not like to see people lose jobs, I must admit I will shed no tears over the news that Starbucks on Duval is gone. I have a long standing disgust for national chains in Old Town KW for a lot of reasons I will not repeat now. While I have no general issue with national chains in most places, including KW outside of Old Town, I will go way out of my way not to patronize them in Old Town. Hopefully with its closing more people will go spend their money at awesome little places that make up (rather than detract from) the mosaic of true KW character like Cuban Coffee Queen or other locally owned and unique to KW establishments."
