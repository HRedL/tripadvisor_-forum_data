"Last night I saw a report on TV about the rise of dengue in Costa RIca ( because of all of the rain) and since we are traveling with our 18 month old daughter, I am getting really nervous, to the point where I am considering canceling the trip. My husband and I are seasoned travelers but I would never want to put my child at risk of getting ill. I know that the news can often sensationalize things so I was just wondering if anyone can give me any idea about any recent outbreaks (we are staying in the Santa Teresa area during the first two weeks of August). Are some areas worse than others? Am I being paranoid?Thanks very much."
"Make sure you use insect repellent religiously day and night on everyone in your party, I like Cutter Advanced( no deet) but checked with your pediatrician if safe for your toddler."
"Some areas are worse than others, it's true, but it really doesn't matter that much since it can change quickly.Using a good insect repellent is your best defense, as Cubanon said. I would be sure to use something that is appropriate for a child of that age and be vigilant about how often to use it. If you are concerned about mosquitoes in your lodging, you can buy mosquito coils and burn them. They are pretty unobtrusive and really work - I have used them successfully many times."
"I too feel strongly about using repellent. I just had a baby in Guatemala, where there are so many mosquitos it's insane and my mom brought me 2 different types of repellent for children that aren't toxic and they work. As long as you use that, you'll be good!Hope this helps,Marina K. Villatoro"
"Mama, I understand your worries. We are leaving in a few days with our 17 month old. Everything I've read says that children their age can use no greater than 30% DEET. I've also heard of parents spraying their toddlers with the non-toxic brands and dabbing the DEET on their clothing.We purchased a mosquito net and Sawyer Family Permethrin treatment which we're applying to the net and all our clothes. I'm bringing along lightweight long-sleevers and pants to keep our little one covered up as often as he can still feel comfortable. I think, if you take extra precautions like these, you'll greatly reduce the risk to your child. Enjoy your trip!Edited: 10 years ago "
"All great advice, also, whenever possible, place a running fan nearby, that helps dispel the mosquitos"
Bring a good repellent ...more cases of dengue in Florida than Costa Rica.I travel around my country with my little ones all the time...we just try to have them cover by a good repellent mostly of course at night!roadadvisor
Dengue can and does get epidemic in the fall in the pacific coast..Costa Rica's central Pacific town of Parrita and its environs are suffering a dengue fever epidemic that so far has reached 223 cases this year –more than five times ...ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/…0826081.htm Lots more than US at times..Tourists do get it rarely insect precautions www.cutteradvanced.comAvoid epidemic areas your should be ok where you are going.www.mdtravelhealth.com for correct CDC info on all of this...Prefer Dec-Mar for CR visits lots less rain...
"As others have stated you will definitely want to use insect repellent, you should make sure your hotel rooms have intact screens and better yet air conditioning, which helps to repel mosquitos. When you hear about dengue in Costa Rica, you need to keep in mind that most homes do not have screens on the windows and most people living here do not use repellent on a day-to-day basis. If those measures were followed, particularly the screened windows, there would be significantly less risk of mosquito born infection. Of course people deserve to understand the true risks so they can make informed decisions. I am not sure the statement about there being more dengue in Florida than Costa Rica came from, but as of mid-June Florida had only reported about 30 cases of dengue for the whole previous year (and none in the previous 74 years). Contrast that with the headline yesterday's edition of Costa Rica's La Nacion:Casos de dengue subieron 33% en solo dos semanasHasta ayer había registro de 9.700 enfermos, 2.400 más que a mitad de junioTranslation: Cases of dengue have risen 33% in two weeks.Up to yesterday had registered 9700 illness, 2400 more than in the middle of June.Here is a link to the article:nacion.com/2010-07-03/…ElPais2432144.aspxEdited: 10 years ago "
"Thanks to everyone for your thoughtful responses and advice. I really, really appreciate all of your input."
"We traveled with our (then) 11 month old daughter last year and took the following precautions - brought a mosquito net with us and used it over her crib at night - were vigilant about dusk and dawn - were aware that dengue mosquitos are daytime mosquitos (not that the toddlers are out much at night in the US because it stays light late, but remember that dusk in CR is at 5pm) - used Avon skin so soft with repellant SUNSCREEN during the day so that she was protected all day long (sun and bugs) -- were vigilant about keeping the screens closed and using citronella on our decks. We have a home in CR and are pretty relaxed about the dengue issue because the outbreaks tend to occur in more populated areas, but better safe than sorry! Going back in a couple of months with granddaughter again and will follow the same program. She LOVED Costa Rica, don't deprive your children because of the fears, but do be careful. (P.S., it may just be me, but we go to CR twice a year, and the deet just doesn't work for me, only the picardin)."
rmaria- thank you so much for sharing your experience and advice. I do really want my little one to enjoy all of the things that CR offers!
I know how scary it is! Just have them well covered and sprayed and you guys will have a great time!!!
