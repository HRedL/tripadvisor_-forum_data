Hi... I have flight from India on 23rd of March..I have a booked a vacation for 7 days..going to Nuwara Eliya and Unawatuna. I cant figure out the situation regarding coronavirus....Just worried because I am traveling with a infant...Should i cancel my trip..?
"Hi there,If you and the infant are in good health, no worries whatsoever. Lanka currently has no cases of COVID9 and tourists from India are not under suspicion.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29396…< Erik> & [Sandya]"
As of now Sri Lanka has not reported any cornona virus cases not even to the extent like India has done in the past few days.It is absolutely safe as of now to travel and enjoy your vacation here
"We also have an upcoming trip to SL from India. I have been following news reports closely and so far SL hasnot reported anything negative. Max we can do is to follow strict personal hygiene , which should be enough. Traveling to/from SL & from/to India isnot an issue anyway."
""" I cant figure out the situation regarding coronavirus""Google is your friend....Just type ""coronavirus stats"" and press enter, and bingo!https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
Even i have booked my trip to srilanka from india between 5 to 15 april but people around are panicking and suggesting to cancel the trip and stay safe at home....feeling dicey and keeping track on news....praying for all.....infants and 60+ have more chances of getting infection so i suggest you avoid
"Safe at home? Right now I would prefer to be in Sri Lanka than in Slovenia. The in-country travel is alsmost risk-free, the airports and planes are what should be of anyone concern."
"Sri Lanka is in a very fortunate position. An island with just one major point of entry, so people in and out can be strictly monitored. From what I hear, the monitoring at the airport and follow-up is very rigorous. So let's hope that the country can keep the virus at bay."
"1 recovered case in Sri Lanka, no active cases, 31 cases in India, do the maths, which country is safer?It is an evolving situation, but you are infinitely safer in Ski Lanka than almost anywhere else in Asia, Europe, Australasia and North America."
"There are totally 4 active covid 19 cases in srilanka as of this writing .. But trust me, it's so safe to travel unless you maintain good hygiene.Edited: 1:45 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I have plan for May, what you decided, we are also in much confusion. Let me know"
"Well much has changed since the previous answer on this thread, on the 13th of March. And we certainly can't be guessing about the situation in May.If I'm to bet on it, I'd say cancel now and book again later on.Keep watching the news. You shouldn't rush down here just because someone said so. The same way you shouldn't cancel your life plans without understanding the situation."
"Hello to you...as the pandemic (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world the advice is STAY AT HOME. As hard as it may sound and our way of life as we know it has changed you may find that you will be stranded in a country or somewhere you do not want to be or worse still you become infected. You owe it to yourself, your family and everyone else. Yes cancel the holiday.....Stay safe"
What did you decide to do?
We live in Western Australia so we are at HOME and staying safe...travel for now in cactus due to the virus...hope you are doing the same and stay safe...
"If you look at some of the early posts, you see people were wrong. all the travel that was happening only helped to spread the COVID19 further around the world, due to it's asymptomatic nature. International travel is all but shut down now around the world. And I take the time to write this to say that if you are still traveling, domestic or even intra-state... STOP!!! The only way to contain and end this must include isolation. All the great work being providing by healthcare and grocery workers and the rest, it can only slow the spread.Without isolation, the world can't win!!!"
Don't travel
All in bound flights are currently suspended. Unfortunately it does not seem like they would open Sri Lanka for visitors any time soon.Btw have a look at this live tracker to get an idea how much Sri Lanka has been affected by covid-19 and which cities have the highest number of cases.https://covid19-livetracker.com/
Ypu shouldn't be traveling anywhere for everyone's safety.The virus spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious and vulnerable to people with existing chronic medical conditions.
stay home for life!The government will think about everything!
I should be travelling to Malaga on the 10th May but obviously will not be going.Tripadvisor have continued to ask for my balance (€900)for the trip whilst at the same time telling me that my trip will be cancelled.I have emailed three times to ask what to do and they haven’t told me.I have always been a huge fan of Tripadvisor but not sure anymore. I know that they are a huge organisation but they should have the technology to let travelers know what they are doing. Very unhappy and uncertain as to whether I will get my deposit back and have found it difficult to get in touch with them. At this point not sure if they will blame me for cancelling or do the honourable thing and refund my deposit. I want to go to the apartment but it will be in 2021 because everything is so uncertain now.
"Hi there,As I read it the question is not specific to Lanka and not even Spain/Malaga, but generic about the conversation with TA. Then these folkshttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i12…tend to be the best to help you a bit...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Have a Rhine River cruise schedule for October. Two seniors one is in his 80’s . Would you travel at this time of year given the pandemic? It looks like Viking will be cruising at that time. I worry about the second wave of the virus some are predicting.
"10 percent of coronavirus patients with diabetes die within a week of hospitalization, new study findsTen percent of COVID-19 patients with diabetes die within one week of being hospitalized, according to the first study of the virus to examine its impact on hospitalized patients.According to the research, published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, one in five patients end up being intubated and needing a mechanical ventilator at that point, as well.The study analyzed 1,317 patients admitted to 53 public and private French hospitals between March 10 and 31.The findings also showed that 65 percent of COVID-19 patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital are men, and the average age of all patients admitted who have diabetes is 70."
"A Washington Post analysis of early data from jurisdictions across the country found that the novel coronavirus appears to be affecting — and killing — black Americans at a disproportionately high rate compared to white Americans.Majority black counties have three times the rate of infections and nearly six times the rate of deaths as majority white counties, according to the analysis.“Why is it three or four times more so for the black community as opposed to other people?” President Trump asked at Tuesday’s White House task force briefing. “It doesn’t make sense, and I don’t like it, and we are going to have statistics over the next probably two to three days.”But based on what we know about the inequities in many black communities, it does make sense. The Fix dug in to better understand why the coronavirus is apparently killing black Americans at a faster rate than other groups. Here are some of the main causes."
"'Too many have already died': Leaders call on Congress to take action for minorities amid coronavirusThe coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately impacted minority communities across the U.S.The CDC has yet to show a full breakdown of coronavirus cases by race and ethnicity, but a May 2020 study has shown that majority-black counties are three times more likely to have coronavirus cases and almost six times the death rate as white-majority counties. This includes both rural and urban areas.The House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on Wednesday to address this issue and allowed leaders in these communities to air their concerns. Dr. James Hildreth, the president and CEO of Meharry Medical College, said that Congress needs to “act now” and ensure that aid for minorities is included in the next stimulus package.“Too many have already died,” he said. “More are dying as we sit here, in this moment, talking and not acting. Many more will die tomorrow if we delay.”"
