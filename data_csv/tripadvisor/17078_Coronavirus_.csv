Will be arriving on the 1st of February from England. What is the current situation regarding the coronavirus in Hua hin and the surrounding areas? Are lots of people wearing masks or is it not that bad?!Thanks in advance......
1 73 year old Chinese lady has been confirmed as having virus and hospitalised. She came with a tour group. I have mask and wear if I am going to night market. Not as many Chinese tourists in previous years. You will be fine
What makes you think it’s bad in the first instance?
"Hi Clive ,On the BBC it was reported that 30K visitors from Wuhan, had already visited Thailand in January,before the lockdown of that province.And I think 14 confirmed cases now in Thailand.As BK,Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hua Hin seem to be the locations for Chinese tours,folks will be concerned."
"Thanks for the info Manchester, good old beeb getting everything into perspective once again."
"The mass panic of many new members posting hundreds of multiple threads across multiple TA forums, all on the same subject has probably caused the concern I'd imagineOn the Cambodia & Sri Lanka TA forums, there is a single thread on each forum, on the subjectFor some reason, people posting on the Thailand & Vietnam TA forums decided we needed nearly a hundred threads all about the same thing for some reason ?Perhaps the people posting all the duplicate threads can explain why they are doing this ?"
"More people die of malaria (where it is prevalent) than anything else, so we ALL have to get this in perspective."
"""Perhaps the people posting all the duplicate threads can explain why they are doing this ?""The problem is, a great many of these threads have been started by our usual TA trolls, and take delight in getting ppl to reply, which once it gets shut down, they just start up another, and another and another.It's mostly I believe just bored school kids with nothing better to do with their lives then getting kicks out of annoying ppl on the internet.Unfortunately, TA doesn't seem to care and has done nothing to stop these pathetic trolls, so the more ppl post on the trolls threads, the more they will come back over and over again."
"Bird Flu ,Sars always something..I think countries sending planes to get expats out of Wuhan and then putting them in quarantine,is heightening the hysteria.Also airlines cancelling flights to China for 2 days to assess the situation?How they'll do that god knows.."
"Yes, in life, it will always be something; coronavirus, bird flu, ebola, malaria, weather events (hurricanes, floods etc.), politics, conflicts/wars etc."
"Misinformation spreads China virus panichttps:/…Edited: 12:41 pm, January 30, 2020 "
"Sadly this virus has everyone panicking all over the world.Travelling tomorrow to Chiang Mai and then Hua Hin have a mask packed just in case. I feel the plane is an issue confirmed space and people sneezing and coughing, not covering up when they do this."
"Hi, we are at the moment in Hua Hin - yes, 20% people are wearing masks but that´s all. Siutation is very normal - may be less people here than expacted - makes the life here more nice - shops and restaurants are not so crowded. Anhow: we enjoy to stay here (whole month in Hua Hin) in Anantara Resort but go every evening in the city for restaurant and massage. I would recomand you come here Greatings Stefan"
We are heading into Hua Hin with our young kids next Friday and unless i seriously get more fact based information we will not be wearing masks!! There are so many more highly transmittable diseases that are possible to catch (remember this particular virus is known to have difficulty passing human to human). We live in Exeter in the UK and our University has thousands of Chinese students so the situation here is not much different from Hua Hin and no-one is wearing masks. I understand why the question was asked but please understand the facts and the context.
why would the severity of the outbreak be related to the number of misinformed or paranoid mask wearers. I am not wearing mask and they have sold out of masks and gel in Bangkok anyway.
"# 13 ... have the students just returned from holiday from China.And do keep up with the present news, it is now being passed from human to human, in country, in 3 countries, with Thailand now being one of them."
"Just finished packing and this time tomorrow night we will be in CM. Interesting that Hua Hin is a bit quieter, which I will not mind either.I think there must be a shortage of masks and gel everywhere as we have same issues in some areas of Sydney.Edited: 7:41 am, January 31, 2020 "
"Hua Hin is not quieter because of the Coronavirus, there has been in general a lot fewer westerners this year than ever before long before the outbreak was ever reported in part due to a strong Baht and other worldwide problems as indeed all the other Thai resorts are suffering from the same problems.As for face masks, Fascino in Market Village had a healthy stock of them this morning but its mainly Asian folk buying them and wearing them, A few Falangs (westerners) are wearing them and have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone wearing one."
# 15.....Yes i would have thought it was obvious that many are likely to have visited their families during the UK xmas break and returned before here the lockdown period.
"Not sure how many fly international for a Xmas break, and to where. Supposedly virus in one area at Xmas, I think, and how many actually would have ended up there & got infected.A month later........nothing."
"Fair enough, im off to enjoy my holiday now."
Surprised this thread is still running!
Not much else to talk about really is there.
Michael you have now posted the same thing 3 times Please stop spamming the Thailand TA forum & actually read what has already been posted many times already
Arrived in Chiang Mai last night and as we excited the airport all tourists are given masks.
"For the air no doubt and if not N95 / 99 mask, then useless.ENJOY"
"Maybe, our driver told us we need to put them on straight away."
"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51358742Beeb update Masks pretty useless.... I would say eat where you can see your food being cooked,ie no sneezing chefs and waitresses and keep your hands clean??"
"Hi I am off to Hua Hin in two weeks how is the virus at the moment pleass,"
The virus is doing fine. Thanks for asking.
You need to worry about air pollution far more than the virus.
"I am go to Hua Hin tomorrow from Malaysia, with my 2 kids... how is the situation now in hua hin ?"
In Chiang Mai and having no issues with virus or air pollution.
Be good if you could keep this dicussion updated as the original poster.I live further south near Suratthani/Donsak which is the travel hub for Koh Samui/Pangang/Tao. Everyone is not wearing masks down here but of course they should be. Wherever there are travellers/tourists you should be wearing a mask/protection. Why ever not for goodness sake!Just take the safest option... it always makes sense for everyone... who cares what it looks like? What are the risks??? Find out for yourself... be informed rather than stupid... please!https://www.youtube.com/watch…
OP ... still alive ... 555
Where can you buy a mask? Most masks are not effective anyway. You need N95 or higher to offer some protection even that is not 100%.
"There have been 25 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Thailand, according to the main tracking site, and no deaths. Risk is really low. That's true of almost everywhere, although the count is highest in Japan (outside China), and per-capita highest in Singapore, even though they only have 28 confirmed cases. Or 30, per another solid reference I've seen, but it's the same number, related to risk. That reference site:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
"Most if not all shops are sold out but a few days ago we topping up at the Shell Petrol station and they offered us face masks, they did look the real deal but neither of us wanted one so didn’t even ask the price but it goes to show you might find them in the unlikeliest places."
I think the chance of catching it in places like Hua Hin and Surat Thani are extremely low. Yes some places have been giving masks out but stocks not last long. Only 25 cases out of 70 million people.
"I think chance of catching are damn near nil........25 / 70 mill people .... what are the odds, especially when 20+ brought it with them.Simply amazing it even gets a mention........anywhere except China"
"If 25 people crashed their scooter last month, and had to go to the hospital, none dying, would the topic of scooters ever be raised ?20 people out of millions arrived sick last more, and a few locals got sick afterward..............should I go....???Stop....you're killing me.I'll have 2 more Coronas please.....no lime.Edited: 5:41 am, February 07, 2020 "
"Hello everyone, i know some news are being exaggerated. i know, unless it has been an epidemic, to travel to Asia except China is safe now. i had a plan for November 2020 to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia and now it is time to buy the tickets but i am afraid that it will be an epidemic. What do you think? Any suggests?"
"Id rather have a Becks, nicely chilled..from what a few ""experts "" have written, and have stated in radio interviews you are way safer looking after yourself by washing your hands regularly...."
That’s why you have travel insurance. If it’s an epidemic then you can cancel and claim on your insurance. Flights maybe cancelled anyway. Have a plan B. Or you can buy flights later. I often buy a few months before at good prices.
"Just came back from hua hin, stayed in the hotel next to the hospital where the Chinese were quarantined. No problem what so ever. Like many have said before air pollution and road accidents are more likely to kill you than corinavirus"
"Mehmet A, I would buy your ticket and take out travel insurance. SARS was worse than this virus."
Brfc dar heading to Hua Hin in 2 days and looking forward to it.
"Post #43""""""That’s why you have travel insurance. If it’s an epidemic then you can cancel and claim on your insurance""""""The following site is at variance with that statement.https:/…43a35f804d641. If you don’t want to travel, one kind of insurance will cover you. “Only a ‘cancel for any reason; travel insurance policy allows you to cancel your vacation because you're afraid to travel,” says Daniel Durazo, a spokesman for Allianz Travel.2. Standard ""named perils"" policies usually exclude epidemics and pandemics. But they will cover you if you become sick on your trip. “Being worried about traveling to a destination is not a covered reason under standard trip cancellation insurance,” says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com.3. If you have not booked your vacation and are still in the planning phase, you can either change your destination to avoid Asia or you can buy an insurance policy that will cover you."
no 44 where the chinese were quarantined?Looked back to see other posts mentioning this? Have I missed something ? Why were they being quarantined in HH ? Surley they aren't doing that to all Chinese visitors?
I am in Hua Hin at the Centara and I had to fill out a form asking whether I had been to China and had any symptoms.They advised it is just for precautions and to keep guests safe.
Minimal to none people wearing masks in Hua Hin. Hand sanitizer to use before you go buffet breakfast at Centara.
"Hi, Mamaysl (Post 31)Did you go to Hua Hin? Was your flight full?My flight is on 16/02, and decided not to go.How was the atmosphere while you were in Hua Hin?Edited: 3:58 am, February 13, 2020 "
Ally lim. WHY???
Silly for cancelling.
"Ally_limIf you have not yet got the virus in your part of the world, it will eventually reach you. What will you do then? Sit at home in splendid isolation?Perhaps the best thing is to relax and go on holiday to Hua Hin."
Probably More likely to catch it driving a cab in London or skiing in France than in Hua Hin.
or Brighton!
"Just been down the nightmarket in Hua Hin, quieter than usual, mostly western tourists but easy to move around unlike last time I was here. Hardly any masks. Not sure why anyone would want to be as busy as before apart from sellers. Can’t believe how many massage parlours there here now."
@ ManchesterBuster. Yes according to official figures there are now more UK citizens infected with the virus than here are Thais.
"Hummmm a lot of this has to be taken with a pinch of salt. On 9th February, there were 7 new cases in Thailand. See...https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…Edited: 3:24 am, February 15, 2020 "
Watching BBC news now Doctor on the sofa says more people die from Influenza every year....
"Yes, I just saw that. More people spreading misinformation on social media."
"WHO says fake coronavirus claims causing 'infodemic'The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging tech companies to take tougher action to battle fake news on the coronavirus.The push comes as a representative from the WHO travelled to Silicon Valley to speak directly to tech firms about the spread of false information.The WHO has labelled the spread of fake news on the outbreak an ""infodemic"".Over 1,000 people have died as a result of the outbreak, which began in central China but has spread globally.Andrew Pattison, digital business solutions manager, for the WHO said false information was ""spreading faster than the virus"".Bogus claims that the virus was spread by eating bat soup or could be cured by garlic have already swept the web.https:/…technology-51497800"
"Flew home from Bangkok and arrived into Sydney this morning at around 6.10am. When we started to prepare for landing Thai Airways made an announcement about the Cornavirus and if you are not feeling well please let cabin crew know.Well as we pull in and about disembark, people up and getting hand luggage an announcement was made that everyone needs to be seated due to a person not feeling well and nobody will be leaving the plane until the person has been assessed by medical staff and cleared.The plane was just about full. Well done Thai Airways for being very proactive in this instance.Edited: 4:08 am, February 15, 2020 "
