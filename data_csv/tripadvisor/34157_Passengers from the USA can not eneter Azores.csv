"(I apologize for enEter)In case somebody does not know or not sure.Unless you are a special case - there is a no-go!https://www.azoresairlines.pt/en/mandatory-pâ€¦""Flights from the United States of AmericaPassengers traveling from the United States of America with final destination the Autonomous Region of the Azores, must comply with the following conditions: They must be nationals of the European Union, citizens of Schengen Member States, or members of their families, under Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, and nationals of non-member countries legally resident in a Member State of the European Union. The travel of non-EU citizens must be for essential reasons: work, study, family reunification, health, or humanitarian reasons. Passengers must provide proof of testing to COVID-19 with a negative result within the last 72 hours before departure from the United States. They may also perform the SARS-CoV-2 screening test at the time of disembarkation, and biological samples must be taken by the health authority professionals at the airport. In this case, the test cost is covered by the Regional Government of the Azores. After the test, they must remain in prophylactic isolation at their home or place of accommodation until they are notified of the test result. If the stay lasts seven days or more, on the 6th day after the date of the first screening test for SARS-CoV-2, passengers must contact the health authority of the municipality in which they live or are staying to perform a new screening test, promoted by the local health authority, which result will be communicated to them later.

How does that work if you're military and you're going to the US Base in Lajes? Lol...
"The travel of non-EU citizens must be for essential reasons: work, study, family reunification, health, or humanitarian reasons - either a military or any other person if you have a WORK reason you can fly to Portugal or Europe if EU space."
"It would be incumbent upon the might of the United States military (or any other employer) to provide the necessary paperwork to the Azores government, including health certificates as required.I assume military personnel do not turn up at Lajes unannounced!"
"I don't think so, at most a flight plan but a US Base is considered US territory. I don't think Washington asks Havana if they can land in Guantanamo...same thing for Lajes, I reckon. Well...if GITMO fills up, they may take the rest to Lajes...lol"
