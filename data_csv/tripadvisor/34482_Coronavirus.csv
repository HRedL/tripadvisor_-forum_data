"Hi,We are due to fly out to Sal on 29 March from London. Obviously we are concerned about the coronavirus situation but do not wish to cancel at this stage. Is anyone on Sal island at the moment tell us how things are currently? Also what are the precautions at the airport?Thank you and enjoy your holiday.Edited: 12:50 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Hi, sorry not an answer - but we are in the same situation due to fly on Wednesday this week. We are just so unsure of what to do, I will be anxiously watching replies to your question."
At the moment flights from UK are normal. This is such a fast moving situation that you will just have to keep your fingers crossed. No confirmed cases in CV as yet. They seem to be just checking your temperature on arrival at Airport. Flights from some European Countries have been paused by TUI. Flights from Italy were stopped already and the ban has been extended to end of June.
Hi. Thanks for your reply. We will keep checkingAre you their at the moment?
"Not at moment but back and forth all Winter. My Wife has just checked in online for next Sundays flight and is hoping it goes. I was last there a few weeks ago and due back end of April. We shall have to see ! One of 2 things will happen, either CV will go on lock down or our Government will say not to travel there. If this happens you should get a refund ."
Thank you. Very grateful If its not to much trouble would you please keep us updated on this thread.
"I’m in Santa Maria currently, flew here a week ago and truly feels like the safest place to be right now! Everyone is clearly being a little more cautious, coughing into there arm and lots of hand gel, but it’s all good. Who knows what may happen in the coming days but there is no hysteria as of yet."
Everyone should be aware that the medical facilities on Sal are very limited. At the moment there are no cases but the people there are at great risk from someone bringing it with them from Europe. Something to think about.
Thank you to everyone who replied. Please keep us informed.
"Hi everyone, I was about to enjoy Mauritius as of Sunday 22.03.20, unfortunately Mauritius government is taking no more chances and they shutting down the airport from Wednesday. Thinking about Cape Verde but due to circumstances I didn`t get much chance to do any research about the place. What is the current situation over there and did you hear any rumours regarding airport shut down or etc ? TUI still have some packages on offer. Any advise will be appreciated.Edited: 7:09 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Watch the news!!!!!
"Just spoken to friend who lives on Sal and no panic , things normal. However i would be surprised if flights continue much longer. I was planning a visit end of April but do not think it will happen but you never know."
"I think some people don't have a choice at the minute Rashyroo - until the airlines or government cancel, we are bound to come on holiday or lose ££££s. I'm more than happy to rearrange to a later date for the safety of myself, family and the others (travellers and locals alike) but the UK travel companies aren't cancelling until officials say so."
"Believe CV Authorities are meeting today to discuss flights. A decision needs to be made one way or another. If they are stopping flights then i hope it is a phased, orderly withdrawal and not a mad panic to bring everyone back . People who booked ages ago who have not traveled yet will get refunds."
"I posted this to another thread, but hopefully it bears repeating here:I think that there are two separate issues here.One is the risk of getting sick while in resort, especially given the minimal medical facilities on the islands.The other is the risk of bringing the virus to the islands. If planeloads of tourists keep arriving, it's inevitable that sooner or later Covid-19 will spread there. I'm not convinced that checking temperatures on arrival at the airport will achieve a whole lot, as most people with the virus won't be showing any symptoms for the first week or so.Personally, I think I'd prefer it if TUI were to cancel our holiday. If not, we'll need to decide whether to go (and take the risks) or stay (and lose a few thousand pounds). There are no easy answers."
That’s interesting.....I’m due to fly tomorrow!!
"I am afraid the Virus will reach CV even if Tourist flights are stopped. Perhaps it will take longer . Not every Cape Verdian is sat at home to prevent the spread, they fly abroad just like us. Agree though lets get a decision which will be to the benefit of all. Fingers crossed for you Danni, i know how much you have been looking forward to this visit. My Wife is due to fly Sunday but is happy if she gets a full refund.Edited: 7:03 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Ah thanks.... yes it’s a well needed holiday but seems so selfish of me to be excited!! I’m constantly checking google, my emails, the news....."
"I've seen on another thread that there has been a message from the Prime Minister of Cape Verde on FB page to confirm that air links will be banned for 3 weeks from 18th March - Portugal/All EU Covid-19 affected countries, USA, Brazil, Senegal and Nigeria - with a possibility this could be extended."
Still waiting for confirmation that Europe means UK as well. Should be clearer later today. FCO telling you not to go abroad which will probably void your insurance.
"Received e mail confirmation from Tui today that our holiday is cancelled. We were due to fly on Sunday 22nd. Disappointed of course, like everyone else we were desperately looking forward to this holiday. However, as a cancer nurse working in the NHS, I see the devastation this virus is causing to the population and to NHS staff so I support all measures. We will have other holidays, some won't get that chance. My heart also goes out to all those people who were going abroad to be married. So sad. My plan is to hopefully find a log cabin in the UK for a week and cancel my second week of leave to return to work. Stay safe people and look after the vulnerable around you"
"Total agree with you #20 - also, can I say thank you to you and all your NHS colleagues who are about to risk their health and lives for the sake of others, I don't feel you get thanked enough. Like you say, I can go on another holiday another time - many people won't as an outcome of this virus."
Thank you for your very kind comments and support of the NHS. I hope you find a lovely holiday later in the year. I've managed to book a lakeside lodge in Tattershall Lakes for a week from tomorrow so I'm sure a few cheeky G & Ts in the hot tub plus a good selection of holiday reading will be a good compromise. Stay safe and do whatever you can to keep your spirits up
Hot tubs are a re ideal bug incubators hope you survive
I would think a holiday lodge where its just a couple of people using a hot tub will pose little risk for contracting coronavirus....its not like dozens of people will be using it and they are always well cleaned out before us...This link suggests there is no danger provided maintained correctly....https:/…water.html
Wouldn't risk iy myself unless it was my own tub and I had maintained it and no idea who was using it previously.
"We were supposed to fly with TUI on Thursday, has anyone else heard from them about rebooking /refunds ?"
"We booked for 17 th April , they haven’t cancelled it yet but I’m sure they will .. I’ve heard someone died on boa vista , and I think maybe they are in lockdown too.things are only going to get worse before they get better .."
"TUI hoped flights would resume 16th April and you can still book flights after that date but agree not much chance of that happening. Until it is official then they will not cancel but its just a question of time. One death on Boa Vista , an elderly Englishman who was stopping at one of the RIUs. The CV Government has totally shut off BV and no one can get in or out. Sal had a few suspected cases but none were confirmed. Bars were stopping open till 9pm but that has now stopped and only Chemists and food shops open."
Sad news I love CV but its one of the last places I would want to be in the current situation. I hope the virus doesn't run rife with the local population.
If you go on the live webcam for Sal you can see locals not standing 2 metres apart on the pier. They are playing catch up with Europe and need to up their game.
"I can only praise Tattershall lakes for their superb hot tub maintenance. Every morning the maintenance man came and did a comprehensive sampling routine of the water and it was just my husband and I using the tub as each lodge has it's own individual tub. As it was, the break was cut short as the site received instructions to close prior to the country entering lockdown. Those dew days from Friday to Tuesday morning were bliss and a welcome break before I returned to my nursing duties. I hope you are all surviving the lockdown, staying safe and being kind to yourself and others"
The latest information is that there are 165 cases with 2 deathshttps:/…
Just before Flights had to stop a new Tourist attraction opened called Zipline Cabo Verde. I chanced upon their Facebook Page. There are videos on there showing what life has been like in Santa Maria recently which i found very interesting. I wish to add i have no connection with this business but fancy a go when flights resume.
