"My daughter's friend is supposed to be flying home from DUB on Monday. I was wondering if there were any recommendations on what time to arrive at the airport? We've gone with 4 hours in the past but that was then. I hear there are longer waits - any idea how long? Should she go 5 hrs early? 6 hrs? Or is 4 still good?She's a US citizen.Thanks.Edited: 7:48 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Thanks.

"I saw that, but I was leaving 4 hours before COVID-19, so if there are extra checks, I was thinking she might need more than 4."
It's Sunday and I'm at the airport now. Pretty empty and no lines whatsoever. But I would still recommend 4 hours. Better sitting here having a coffee than worrying about missing a flight.
"Just an update, my daughter flew home yesterday and there was a line for check in that took about 10 min. She said there was no line at all for Irish security, US CBP, or TSA. She forgot to check the exact time, but she was estimating maybe 40 min for all the formalities.As an aside, she flew Aer Lingus and they were seating people in every window seat but no one in the aisle seats. The middle rows were all empty except 2 that had family groups seated in them. She also said it was the cleanest plane she's ever seen. She was wearing a buff as a mask, but said Aer Lingus had masks for people who don't have them. She wished she had one because she said it was hard to sleep with the buff on - every time she put her head back she felt like she was suffocating. And once she got to Chicago, it was too hot to have the buff on, but once she got into the terminal it was suitably cold again."
"Glad to hear your daughter managed to get home safely, btgm.Of course the waiting-time at the airport was short since travel to the US for citizens from Ireland, the UK and the Schengen area is restricted at the moment."
"Yes, volumes are certainly down, and I think probably most people have returned home already. She said a lot of the people on her flight looked like they were traveling for business.However, when I asked a couple of months ago, volumes were also down (although not as much) and people were reporting the wait taking longer than usual.Oma, you'll be happy to know that she went through security THREE times on this trip. ;-) Irish security and TSA in Dublin and then TSA again in ORD. It sounds like the way they have the covid screening set up in ORD (somewhere near passport control) you end up outside security so you have to go back through at your connecting terminal. She said it took about 40-45 min from touchdown to getting back through security in ORD, so waits weren't bad there either."
btgm what's a buff ?
It's a neck wrap/head cover/face cover.https://buffusa.com/shop-buff/women/multifunctional-headwear-category/original+original-xl-family.html
I had to google Culchie. Is it very negative?
"I refrained from asking what a ""buff"" is in case I was thought to be completely gaga.""Culchie"" can be perceived as being negative, btgm, it basically means anyone from the country outside Dublin (typical townie versus country attitude). But among friends it can also be a something like a pet name these days. And many Irish are proud of being a ""culchie"", particularly if they can show the Dubs up to be eejits. Just google ""Culchie Festival"" and you'll get some results about the culchies sending themselves up.We have a friend from Kiltimagh in Co. Mayo where the term ""culchie"" is supposed to come from (not sure whether this is true) and we could call him a ""culchie"" without him taking offence and then we're off into the most hilarious banter.I hope very much that ""culchie"" is not a negative term anymore."
Yes Clauds in the hierarchy of culchieness Kiltimagh would have been considered top tier ;-)
So glad all went well and your daughter is home safely.I do hope her semester wasn't adversely impacted by the virus.
I flew DUB-Bos In April and because of shorter queues 3 hours was sufficient. The flight was almost empty.
"Thanks lordkimmage. Unfortunately, because of covid, she was unable to travel to do research for her dissertation, so she had to completely change the topic. It remains to be seen whether that will have a long term effect. Overall, it was still a positive experience. She was scheduled to be there for a year so had about 6 months before covid reared its ugly head. She did come home early because everything from here is online and she has been on stay at home orders in Ireland too. She can stay at home for free here."
Interesting feedback that the buff felt too warm. Was that a winter weight buff or a regular weight or the cool net?
Buff was regular weight.
