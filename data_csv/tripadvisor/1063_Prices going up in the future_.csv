"With the prospect of the DR/PC and resorts re-opening in the next few months, the issue of whether there will be a significant price increase next year becomes interesting for those still planning trips in the near future. Will they lower prices trying to attract visitors or will they raise prices trying to recoup $$$?"
"Sly, Great topic! Surprisingly, since I have stayed on top of resorts I am interested in, for our October visit, their are no great promotions(I book via hotel.) In the future, I see some resorts raising prices."
"You are not clearing the waters with this post. It only feeds ""speculation"" and in reality, we do not need more ""speculation"". It only leads to confusion. Thus...no comment."
"Thanks for your comment Mike. But honestly it has nothing to do with speculation but more about preparations and trying to gauge whether it is worth waiting or booking future trips now. Thanks for your input though. Prize, exactly. I'm monitoring prices for late September and although no great deals, prices have not gone up since the lockdown.Edited: 10:45 am, May 14, 2020 "
Probably lower prices for the fore seeable future. I priced 11 days/10 nights including non-stop flights from Boston to the Ocean Blue for $1925.00 a couple!!
"I booked in early February, for travel in late December, 2020 - at the time of booking, the current travel climate was unforeseeable.....the current hotel price is relatively the same as when I booked, however the flight price has jumped by over $300 pp."
Not familiar with Ocean Blue but that sounds like a pretty good deal. What month is that for?
"Funny you should start this topic today Sly as I am currently emailing back and forth with my travel agent to rebook my May trip to December 2020. She tells me if we get cancelled by Transat because of Covid again, it will mean another 24-month credit, which is OK with me and I am purchasing extra Option Flex insurance this time as well. Looking at the week before Christmas holidays so that will make it more manageable if we have to quarantine on return. I want to rebook now because I *am* worried prices will go way up (still within the usual range for BP Ambar so far) and also because I need a countdown and something to look forward to :)"
"I haven't shopped around for other resorts btw, but for the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana, prices from fall till April 2021 are still similar to what it was last year."
"Ocean Blue and Sands. I looked at September and October and got the same price. Been there 5 or 6 times over the years. Very nice resort with two hugh pools, both with swim-up bars and pretty good food."
Bob that price is crazy good for Ocean Blue!
Yes especially if you deduct the $1200.00 I paid for airfare in October to Hard Rock. $1925.00 - $1200.00 = $725.00 for 11 days/10 nights. Thats $72.00 a day per couple or $36.00 a day per person including air & food!! I can drink that!!
"Got it Bob. Is it the resort where the beach eroded a bit in recent times? I seem to recall we were asked to join a group there a while back. Amelie, that is exactly my point. Some of us are itching to get back but what the future holds as far as rules and whether prices will go up are big factors to consider in planning next trip. Right now, CHIC is priced very nicely with no single supplement for late September so I have my finger on the trigger but still to much unknown to book now."
Yes it is the resort where the beach has eroded away. I have stayed at a different Ocean property it did have great food and entertainment and a fairly lively adults only pool area. It was a incredible value really but I would probably have booked Ocean El Faro instead as it is a newer resort and seems a bit nicer. They also have a separate adults only area (El Beso) though you will still see kids eating at most restaurants other than the Blue Moon which is adults only. Ocean El Faro is near CHIC but beach only runs the length of the resort unless you walk farther up. Still it looks like a very nice property. The prices at Ocean El Faro are only slightly higher than Ocean Blue.
In terms of resorts I can see it going both ways with some upper end properties going more of a safety route with less people and trying to get people to pay up more but that is probably more next year. This year they probably will see more deals to try and get travelers to go if they can.

"I looked for feb 2021 and the price is up $1000 more than usual ! they are going to put prices up by the looks of things & RIU put out a set of rules that will be in order when they open again ( i’m sure most hotels will have the same rules ) and by the looks of them , it’s not even worth going ."
RJP NJ - that was actually really interesting! Thanks for taking the time to explain all this. :)
We booked Elegance Club in January 10 days $3700 taxes in for October18. Now some trip same company is listed at $5600!!!! Hope all is well to travel when planned.
"I'm sure there's segment of people who will book right now even with the higher prices because they are stuck at home, bored and want something to look forward to."
"Been following prices since this started as we had been planning a fall vacation anyways. Flying from OKC but had not narrowed down a destination yet...Flights to the DR have almost doubled. Cancun the same thing.However, seems most resorts are offering tremendous deals. Way better than i have seen before. They're going to have to if all of a suden travelers have to account for a drastic rise in airlne tickets. Overall its been a slight uptick in prices, but nothing drastic...only thing holding us back is the uncertainty right now.Odd thing is...i have seen domestic airline prices fall considerably."
"Thanks RJP-NJ for the interesting read . For Canadian prices, throw into the mix that Canadian tour operators have been issuing travel vouchers for cancelled vacation packages I think it looks like tour package prices for Canadians will rise for next year.Edited: 9:04 am, May 15, 2020 "
"Our price for cancelled vacation package $1759. pp is now $2699. pp for same time, same tour operator next year."
Just noticed a small drop in price for package at CHIC October-December. Seems to be the same for some of the other resorts also.
"RJP ... seems it hasnt fallen in the cruise industry , which I believed would have been hit the hardest https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-…"
I couldn’t believe it when I saw the cruise ship sales upA few months ago they were trying to get off the shipIf ther is a second wave I the fall I wonder how quick governments will be quick to get them homeThey should have to sign a waiver
Some folks are questioning those of us considering a trip south in the next few months but I guess I would question anyone considering a cruise at any price.
"personally, I think when, where and how people travel in the future months and even years is personal choice as we all have different criteriaWe saw what happened last year when there were what appeared to be some unexplained deaths and some said no way am I going there. This pandemic is a bit different but some people will be far more fearful than others. In addition some people will be fitter than othersAs I say it is all personal choice"
Agree FFM. Everyone has a different risk tolerance however very different ball game being on a beach at a resort and being on a ship with 4000 people in close proximity. Just my opinion.
"<< ""Everyone has a different risk tolerance"" >>The issue that many people seem to blow off is that no one travels in a vacuum; not in an airport, not on a plane, not at a hotel, beach, restaurant, etc. Person A's willingness to take on a greater risk will directly impact the risk that Person B is exposed to."
It will break down to tolerance levels. I have no problems with the protocols announced so far. I think I would tend to gravitate towards the Excellence chain where it is mostly a la Cartes vs buffet. I haven’t been to this chain in years but Excellene Punta Cana had a little place right on the beach and for us if they had an a la carte for breakfast with a limited menu so as to speed it up for them would tick all my boxes with social distancing on the beach which could be accomplished by limiting the occupancy level.The only thing that I would have to see how it pans out is air travel.I have seen airlines saying they will lock out the middle seat but when people get on the plane was full as well as empty.I would not wish to travel to the DR the old way but the resorts plans are doable as long as the reality lives up to the sales pitch.I am not living in a bunker but ealistic as to minimize the risk.I think I represent the majority of travellers hopefully and will return but once realities are well known.Steve
"""Person A's willingness to take on a greater risk will directly impact the risk that Person B is exposed to""That is my main concern. As I expressed on another thread no matter what restrictions and safeguards properties, planes and airports put in place some people will think the rules do not apply to them. When people get to the property in the sun and have a few drinks some will just relax and forget about all the restrictions"
Totally agree FFMHopefully people will realize how easily this virus spreads and do the proper thing. If people hear about some people coming back with covid 19 caused from this it might be a wake up call.DR vacations can be done but not in the old ways.If people go down and get loaded up in a group with a great amount of alcohol there are added repercussions this time .Thus your last post.Time will tell.Steve
"I would say that person A and B should know the risks if they are both travelling. But yes, some may not follow proper rules. Not much different than here when I go for groceries. Are folks still leaving their house when sick? That is a risk I take by leaving my own house and I make sure I limit my exposure regardless of others. That being said, that is a discussion for another thread."
"Agreed SlyGuy Everyone knows the risks and the will have to weigh the pros and cons but when you wil have to weigh these when booking your package.Having done that and now that airlines and vacation companies have our money reality sets in.Airlines that advertise the middle seat not being used and transfers not being overcrowded and people behaving badly because of alcohol and thinking they are invincible.That is going to happen we all know it .So I will mitigate the risks but seeing prices are increasing by a lot and maybe no chance of a refund. I am going to return but only after the parties are living up to what they are advertising and being prove by fellow TA visitors or ex. Pats living in the DR having accessed it’s fairly safe to do so and I can enjoy myself.SteveEdited: 11:55 am, May 15, 2020 "
"I booked Grand Bavaro Princess, Platinum Suite, for 10 days, Ottawa to Punta Cana. I booked on April 20th for $2595/pp. I also purchased Sunwing's Cancel for Any Reason for $49. Yes, it will most likely be a credit voucher, but I am good with that.I checked Sunwing site again last week, and the package had gone up to $2985 - I saved $400 pp. Sunwing is no longer showing the 10 days stay, so I can't compare pricing at the moment."
"Steve I am certainly a glass half full guy and I truly hope things will be manageable by this fall with reasonable measures applied and followed. I dont have a problem with measures at airport and on the plane, just not willing to wear a mask on holidays. In the end, this thread is more about what to expect as far as prices associated with travelling. I'm seeing a slight decrease until Xmas but many have indicated increase especially for 2021. I am looking to book a fall trip as long as I can get insurance and cancellation or rebooking options without loosing $$$. My project for this weekend."
I've booked SCC a few weeks ago for January. Annoyingly the price has gone down by about £75pp. TUI desperation possibly.
I checked out Luxury Bahia Cayo Levantado for next year same time as my trip this year that was cancelled.March 22-27 jr suite superior with plus seats through WestJet vacations comes in at 6600$ roughly an increase of about 1000$.Steve
Cayo Leventado adds another element to social distancing since it is only accessible by boat.First the airport then the shuttle then a boat before arriving at the hotel.Good thing the hotel itself is fairly spread out
I would be willing to wear a mask at the buffet for breakfast if I had to as well as gloves but not planning on wearing them at the ale carte restaurants or the pool area or anywhere else at the resort. Your right though I went to the store the other day and only half the people were wearing mask and one who was behind me in the checkout line was more like 3-4 feet away not 6 so definitely some who are lax on the rules and probably would be on vacay as well.
"Hey SlyGuy book SCC the first two weeks of December 2020. My wife and I will be there, good lord willing! Would love to meet you and share the half glass of rum you mentioned on another thread. Take care safe travels wherever you end up. CJ"
Hey CJ. Would likely be a full glass of rum if can make it down to PC soon. We were at SCC first week of December last year. Beautiful place. I thought it was a bit quiet but wife loved it. Just looked at prices and it is priced very nicely for same week. Never know.
I looked up out of curiosity the price of trip in January.. same week I go every year.... Most were 100.00 more but that's normal when looking this far ahead.... usually October the prices drop... but I guess I wait n see.... have to read some reviews and do some research on different resorts.. see how people are making out with the new rules
"Betty, prices for January are still pretty normal. The big spike starts in February for some reason. Agree that it will be nice to see when resorts open so we can monitor new measures early on."
"IF and that is a big IF, we are able to go, we will be returning in January to Ambar. We will be in a swimout suite and we won't be using main pool (we haven't anyway since they built the swimouts) Honestly if the price is up a bit, i will still try to go as we really need the break. I wanted to go in September for our anniversary, however, I have a business to run and try to recover from the devastation that has occurred to our industry ( I own a restaurant and have still had to pay my bills (rent, utilities, insurance ext totalling over 10 grand a month eeek!) even though our revenue has decreased by 75 percent! My first priority is getting my staff of 24 back to work as only 5 are working right now, and getting our revenue increased again. its a strange new world we are all living in. we ALL need a vacay!"
Booked for sep 21 same price as sep 19
"Amelie...we very well may put it off till May..let us know your dates..for years we have missed you by daysEdited: 5:39 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Hi Lynn :) Our plan is to be there for May 4th 2021, which is our anniversary. Not sure exactly on what day we would be arriving. Hopefully we can squeeze in a fall trip as well :) I’m hopeful :)"
"We had a trip booked and paid for in Punta Cana for the late April. We’d booked through a store.Currently, we are still waiting for our credit note never mind refund. We decided that rather than wait for one or the other, to book online as cheaper the same time next year, same upgrade on the plane for next year. This time we upgraded to the Diamond Club and only cost an extra £180 for the two weeks.We are confident that prices will rise next year. We originally booked this year’s trip last year 2019. The other aspect is, we feel there will be a lot of people looking to get away next year. Therefore, we feel hotels will be booked up making a scrabble for places in hotels and planes at higher prices. Everyone that had booked for this year want to get away and those that haven’t but were looking for next year will all be looking.We had spoken when we booked last year about upgrading but unwilling to pay about £800 to upgrade. But £180 is a lot more reasonable. If nothing else, in future we will always book online because of better prices."
"I have the same concerns so I appreciate you starting this thread, Sly. I missed a hell of a deal from Palladium about a month ago when they had a promo of 25% off. I still kept an eye on their prices, most especially TRS Turquesa, only to see them rise quickly (10% to 15%).I am set to book sooner rather than later but if people choose to ignore resorts in the next few months, we should expect some more promos."
"Not sure what the impact on US/Canada border closure extension will have on air travel but I'm sensing flights will likely get pushed to August. Have not seen changes in prices in the last few days. Great prices all the way to January but a major increase starting in February. If planning on travelling next winter, you may consider going before February and book now otherwise, may be worth waiting to see if prices will go down. February-March prices the highest I have seen in recent years for that period ( from here anyway)."
"We’re going late april, early may. Am just waiting a few days for my dates to be available but I do believe we’re getting a decent price for Bouganville."
"Late April, early May is also my 2nd choice if this fall doesn't work out, and prices for the Ambar are still decent. Bouganville prices also look good for next spring Humoristix! I was supposed to be there last May 2019 and had to cancel for health reasons (of my own, pre-Covid lol). They are supposed to announce more reopening dates here in Qc today, we should be able to go to hair salons in June... I'm not holding my breath that we will be able to travel in the fall, not even road trips, but who knows... I don't think prices will be affected short term. Eventually it will go up."
"Hey Amelie. The latest prices I'm seeing for next year is the first week of April and I've got Ambar basic room at $2,400. This seems high. Do you see prices past that week?"
I suspect the higher prices your seeing has to do with less flights on the schedule at that time and those that are probably are higher priced right now. I have seen after early September not as many flights are listed and those that are seem high.
Yeah not sure if anything to do with flights but I dont recall seeing prices this high. Will see as we go through summer and travelling resumes.
"Hi Sly, I was looking more for end of April/early May... Right now (I just checked) from Mtl to the Ambar, April 29 2021 departure, reg room is @ $1639 and the swimup I would book at $1919. I had paid about $150 less pp for our trip this May, so no big changes yet, considering prices would usually drop closer to the date."
"I changed my search for April 1st, reg room at $2109, but that's typical of high season and why I don't travel in peak times lol"
That's not bad. Must be price with your operator correct? Right now Tripcentral latest bookings are 1st week of April.
"Yes, that’s through my travel agent site... I’ve never tried Tripcentral.."
Just realized you're flying from Montreal. Big difference in price from Ottawa.... and mostly connex flights... urghhh!
"Eh you're barely 2 hours away, you can fly from Montreal easily and a night at the hotel would still probably be cheaper than that price difference!"
"Hi Amelie! I was wondering why I couldn’t see Ambar in april for less than $2709; I had the duration at 14+ days, lol.I like to go on vacation in april, end of winter, lower prices, come back to warmer weather. We’ve never been to La Romana or a Bahia resort so we’ll give a try."
"Humoristix, it's my favourite time to travel too! I love coming back to warm weather, longer days and leaves in the trees :) And the prices are indeed so much better. I love the Bahia chain... The Bouganville looks really nice, definitely on my ""Bahia Bucket List"" lol, with also the Cayacoa and the Samana…Edited: 1:35 pm, May 20, 2020 "
"Ottawa is a 2-hr drive. Park your car at the airport, not gonna cost you $500."
"Yes have flown from Montreal many times. As long as price difference pays for parking, I typically drive direct to airport. Always prefer this to having connecting flights from Ottawa. Right now, looking at CHIC from Montreal last week of September. I'm actually only 1 hour 30 mins from airport."
"Yeah, we were looking at both Samana and La Romana but Bougainville is $600-900 cheaper than Cayo Levantado, the one we were considering in Samana. We don’t mind the murking water... or the topless, lolThe one thing we’ll be missing is a good spa. I’m a big fan of hammam and cold bath circuit but they don’t seem to be fully equipped."
I don't think anyone really knows what prices will do. In Canada there are a lot of seasonal flights from smaller centres. Until we see if these are cancelled or not we will not have a very good idea what winter prices will do.
"Mothers day special 2 for the price of one until may30 Excellence punta canaEdited: 9:00 am, May 23, 2020 "
"Sounds like a great deal. Is this for booking with the resort? Can you travel anytime?Edited: 9:22 am, May 23, 2020 "
"I'm always sceptical of Excellence and their promo codes, here's the results of this one for me for some dates I've been thinking of....Dates 17Nov-08Dec 2020With MOTHERSDAY Code added Total Cost £5244 - £250/nightWithout Code just going straight from TA website via hotel link when dates put into TA Total Cost £4251 - £202/nightSo go figure that one out for a PROMO CODE. That's one expensive FREE Deluxe ride from the airport as a bonus using that code.Try it yourselves folks, see what you get?"
"I too have noticed the wonky Mothersday code for the different Excellence Resorts. The only resort where I saw that there were true savings was at the Excellence Oyster Bay. I was able to save $450 off and receive the free private roundtrip transfer. At other resorts, the Mothersday code made the prices go up vs without the code. Go figure. In that case, the ""PLUS5"" code was the better savings."
Noticed prices down a bit again for late September. They have been trending downward ever so slightly. Extra bonus is that some of the resorts are waving the single supplement.
"Agree to a certain extent Rainforest but I'm not willing to pay that much for reduced service and restrictions. Why I'm actually considering a trip before next winter as prices seem astronomical then. Prices this fall are very tempting as long as things open up again.Edited: 5:20 pm, May 25, 2020 "
This might be the time that we try out a swim up room. Maybe will seem not as restricted as main pool altho we are definitely beach people.
"Not sure which resort you normally visit but Secrets Cap Cana would be perfect right now. Best beach, lots of space for social distancing and great swim ou suites."
We stayed there 2 years ago while living in Ottawa. We loved it. We did eyeball the oceanfront swimsuits (if that's what they are called). Looked beautiful. They were right in front of the preferred beach.
Yes the bungalow ocean front suites are fantastic for sure. The new Hyatt next door also has some very nice ones.
I'll take a peek at the Hyatt. Liked the Zilara in Cancun but I fear this might be too close to the family/kiddos one.
Well the lay out is not bad. Beach is so widespread that you wouldn't be affected by kids on the adults side. And there is nothing south of Zilara until Little John or Sanctuary. Very quiet.
"Surprised to see prices significantly up for July this morning. Not knowing for sure if travel will resume, and even if it does, would think prices would be down to attract people."
I was looking at the Excellence site and never noticed the price differences using codes till I read on here. Not a good move by Excellence resorts. Using codes costs you more to stay.
I think they are looking very hard at travel returning in July. Many resorts have announced re-opening dates. The government has announced re-opening the Punta Cana airport on July 1st as well. Beyond that Mexico is looking at re-opening Cancun on June 1st not sure as many resorts are looking at opening by then but this is despite a spike in cases in Mexico though they only have 1200 or so in Quintana Roo where Cancun and Riviera Maya are located.
"No one if going to any resorts in Mexico from US or Canada before the end of June. Nonessential travel between the U.S. and Mexico will continue to be restricted, according to Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Chad Wolf. “Nonessential travel will not be permitted until this administration is convinced that doing so is safe and secure,” the DHS said in a statement.Though Mexico is eager to welcome back tourists, these border restrictions could keep Americans from returning until at least June 22"
"Again, the non-essential travel ban is only for land borders. Air travel isn't restricted. I'm only speaking for the travel between the U.S. and Mexico as Canada has their own restrictions. The following info is from our U.S. Dept of State. https:/…May 20, 2020COVID-19 Related Travel Restrictions across the U.S. Borders with Canada and MexicoThe United States will temporarily limit inbound land border crossings from Canada and Mexico to “essential travel”.Q&AQ: What will this mean for airline travel and other travel across the border?A: This action does not apply to air, rail, or sea travel at this time, but does apply to commuter rail and ferry travel.Unless Americans are planning on driving, walking, taking commuter rail, taking a ferry, or swimming to Mexico - we can go, lol. Most Americans fly to Mexico - so that's that.Edited: 1:35 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"BBgamer,The current code for the Excellence Properties is ""Plus5"". This works for all including the Beloved and Finest Playa Mujeres. ""Mothersday"" code works for EOB, ERC,The Beloved, and EPC. I only was pricing the Mothersday code with EOB, EPM, and ERC. I only saw true savings with EOB. As that was 2 weeks ago, maybe you would like to try again to see if you get better results. I've noticed that Excellence pricing can be wonky at times. Last Saturday, I checked the price for FPM and saw the price dropped by $150 a night for my Excellence Club swim up. I quickly rebooked. The next morning, it went back to regular price"
"Rainforest55I had a Preferred Club oceanfront swim-up for my last stay at Secrets Cap Cana in Feb. It was absolutely amazing. This is pretty much the only reason why I would do Preferred Club - for an oceanfront swim-up. I received consistent/attentive drink service at my pool and they even offered to bring me snacks from the snack bar. It was highly convenient. I'm an early riser and a diehard beach person. It was nice to go for a swim before I went to the beach and it was great to swim in the early evenings/at night. I booked the same room for my Aug trip (God willing). I do like that you can be in your own world with a swim up - great for social distancing, lol. I did a private tour of the Hyatt Cap Cana properties in Feb. The adult beach was a nice distance away from the family beach."
I have a Dec trip booked which is refundable. Moved SCC to next May. Now looking to see who has early refundable rooms for Dec next year. Who know where the prices may go next year.
Caribbean_travelers Air travel from the US is allowed most resorts did elect to close but travel was not banned as part of the non-essential travel as it only applied to the border and generally traffic by car. So if flights are restored Americans could travel to Cancun next week. It remains to be seen what kind of travel they get though as many flights are not that full at this time domestically though they are starting to improve on occupancy it is still low.
"If number of people on beaches in the states is any indication, I would think many will visit Cancun if it reopens."
Cat. Where are the swim out excellence club rooms. Are the the front pool or at the back pool?
"From JFK, I could get to Cancun tomorrow...Mind you, it will take me 15 hrs since there are no direct flights, but I can still get there, lol!I know that nonstop flights pick up in June from JFK to CUN. With the resorts/hotels being closed now, there isn't a demand, so there really isn't a need for so many flights to CUN right now. BBgamer, for FPM -the Excellence Club building is Building 6 (to reiterate, I booked FPM, not EPM). The swim ups are facing the main pool/beach and also behind. I attached the link to the resort map so you can see for yourself. The rooms that are away from the main pool are more quiet/private. I wanted to try FPM vs EPM as it was a few hundred dollars cheaper for the EC swim-up suite. I know that EPM is completely adults only vs at FPM-it is only a section. However, I like the swim ups so much better at FPM. Also, I'm not anticipating many kids going at the time of my vacation, so why not? I've gotten feedback from many previous FPM guests that say they do like FPM for an adult-only vacation. Most found the food/service equal to EPM, so I'm willing to try"
Thanks Cat! Those beachfront swimouts sound amazing!
So Cat if you can go to Cancun right now (tomorrow) what are the restrictions on the way back?
"Sly, As of now, there are no restrictions for me coming back into the U.S. Quarantine isn't mandatory when I come back to the U.S. It is only suggested/recommended. However, I will self-quarantine before and after my trip as I think that is the right thing to do as a responsible traveler. Below is the link to COVID-19 exit/entry requirements of Mexico for U.S. citizens via the U.S. Dept of State.https:/…""For U.S. citizens returning to the United States from Mexico and all other foreign locations, the CDC recommends you self-quarantine for 14 days.""Again, I'm not saying that it's a good idea to hop to Mexico tomorrow, lol. I'm just sharing U.S. laws and guidelines because there is plenty of misinformation and inaccuracies out there. When it comes to travel restrictions, not all countries have the same policies for its citizens during these COVID-19 times. Yes, Rainforest55 - They are glorious! It is an amazing sight to see that beach/ocean from your room :-)"
It ain’t worth it going anywhere now.. or June-July! Risk-Reward isn’t close to even
Cat just not worth it to travel when US allows anyone to travel with no restrictions on return. Just my opinion.
"CatS ... maybe you could go to Mexico .. but as this is a DR forum what are you allowed to do at this point in regard to travelling to DR?Edited: 8:44 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"Well, there are no international flights in and out of DR, so that is a moot question. Again, as of right now, there is no mandatory quarantine to come back into the U.S. The DR hasn't released its COVID-19 entry/exit requirements/protocols for travel as their airports aren't open yet and the borders haven't been lifted. We shall see what these will be.And I'm not just bringing up Mexico to bring it up. I was asked questions regarding it or I'm correcting misinformation as there are many travelers that read multiple forums for various destinations to vacation plan. With their DR hotel reservations getting pushed back or canceled, they might want to go to another destination that they can get to...It's not my place to tell people to travel or not to travel, I'm just trying to make sure that accurate travel info is out there. People can make their own decisions...Edited: 9:20 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"CatS .. I agree and as much as the PC airport release of being open July is being thrown around social media...IMO that was / is more of a directive to the stores to be ready at that date if and maybe the 4th phase of opening the economy is successfulEdited: 11:49 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"I take things with exact comprehension of facts and evidence, lol. I don't go by assumptions. PUJ announcing the start of its commercial operations on their official Facebook page is just that. This should obviously mean exactly what it is. It's not the start of international travel and it darn sure doesn't mean that the borders will be lifted on that date. These are 2 separate things. Still, I take PUJ announcing its restart as a sign of positivity as things are going in the right direction for DR. The DR govt already stated that tourism will start on July 5th if and only if the previous phases have gone well. Let's also note that July 5 doesn't mean borders will be lifted by DR (and if certain countries will be exempt). This isn't specified in the directive from the DR govt, even though this is what people are assuming. We should all know that this could just mean the start of domestic tourism. It doesn't make sense to speculate/stress when the DR will open for international travel IMO. People still just have to wait and see. I have my notifications set to receive automatic updates from an official DR govt page. This way I'm getting my daily news/updates straight from the horse's mouth."
""" This way I'm getting my daily news/updates straight from the horse's mouth.""Living here as I do...the ""horse's mouth"" can confuse the heck out of you. Say one thing...do another."
Seems like July 5th is getting more traction.https:/…
"so we shut the world down for this ?https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/cor…and out of the .4% was there underlying issues Im not trying to undervalue the lose of any loved one,once you start digging deeper into how the numbers are presented and what they represent, this in my belief will go down as one of the biggest overreaches in history the aftermath is going to cause more death and destruction then the virus ever did or would my impression and Im sticking to it till proven otherwise"
And sadly the mortality rate is approx 80% folks around 70 years old and up.
"<< ""the aftermath is going to cause more death..."" >>This line gets thrown out there a lot... as if it's a given fact. Anyone have a source or data to support this assertion?"
Not sure where you are getting a 80% mortality rate. Maybe that is what it is in Canada. In the US it is far lower. While 80% of the deaths in the US have been in those over 65 only 7.8% of those who get covid 19 that are over 65 are dying here the other 92.2% live.
"Let me clarify for you, 80% of all COVID related deaths were older folks. Meaning more older folks are dying than younger folks. Not surprising but still alarming."
"<< ""Let me clarify for you, 80% of all COVID related deaths were older folks. Meaning more older folks are dying than younger folks.

(FROM LINK BELOW)What you need to do is look at the math a different way. Not ""What percent of COVID-19 deaths are among each age group"" but rather ""What percent of deaths WITHIN each age group are from COVID 19?""When that analysis is done what you see is ""staggeringly large increases in mortality risk"" across all age groups other than 0-17.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2…Edited: 3:57 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Back on topic, noticed that prices have dropped a bit for period February-April. Also saw today that the President is looking to extend state of emergency another 25 days which could affect reopening early July."
I would love for residents of DR to comment on this...I want to know if they feel that DR truly needs another extension for the state of emergency or if they think this is a ploy that is related to the elections...The general elections are supposed to be held on July 5th...Which coincides with tourism (doesn't mean DR borders are lifted on this date) opening for the 4th phase
"I am as qualified as anyone here on the ground. This is a political ploy...nothing more. The less freedom people have, the better (still slim) the chances the current party stays in Power. BTW...two of the 3 legitimate contenders have agreed to a debate. Guess who is missing?"
Well why would politics be any different there? Can't really brag about what is going on in Canada or the states either.
"Sly...No offense, but you don't live in the US, nor do you live in each state which is governed by each governor(think of it as a mini-president) that decides what happens in each state. This is our Federalism. This is enumerated in Tenth Amendment of our Constitution. Basically, you are not in a position to opine(based on fact) re the US. I don't offer an opinion re Canada because I only know what I was taught and what I have read, but haven't experienced. You know me...patriotic until the end. ; )"
Hmmm not sure what triggered this response Prize. I'm pretty sure I am not complementing my own government. I merely stated that politics suck no matter where. Apologies if it came across differently.
"Northern....Couldn't agree more with your opinion re biggest overeaches, especially in the city of Philadelphia, and the state of Pennsylvania. Bottom line, that overeach will reach into my pocketbook."
Sly....No apology needed. I agree politics snucks.
Sly...Reread...my apologies. Please check messages.
"Interesting comments by Frank Raineri President of the Punta Cana Group today. A RATE WAR?Rainieri assured that the tourism sector is going to present a series of proposals to the Government to relaunch the industry quickly, which will include a reduction in rates.The head of the Puntacana Group said he does not want to talk about a “tariff war”, but pointed out that “definitely” they are going to have to “adjust” prices.“We are going to have to yield the hotels, the airports, the carriers. They are all going to have to yield. The state too,” he said."
Yield to him????
His company is the one that developed the Punta Cana Airport among other things. That said I have always heard PUJ had higher fees than most airports and I can imagine there will be some push back from airlines to lower those and help allow more room for lower load rates on planes.
I think what he means is the entire marketplace has to reduce it's pricing and that includes the government and the taxes they charge (some of the highest in the Caribbean for air travel).
I read his comments as positive and trying to get everything running again.
Mike ru getting any inquiries or bookings off of your website to indicate some increasing interest. As borders seem to be peaking peoples interest?Just curious to if businesses in the DR are noticing people getting ready to travel.Steve
"Steeve...a small trickle, but better than a few weeks ago. It will be a very slow awakening. I hope I can make it until then....but not looking good at this point. A simple numbers game! Might see you soon back in the Quinte region."
"I truly hope you pull through Mike along with all the tourism industry.I have heard that if airline companies are made to reimburse all travel vouchers from cancelled trips that prices would increase dramatically. Essentially, transporters that would remain active would do so on reduced staff and flights affecting offer and demand and cost. They would also have given back a substantial amount of cash which would also lead to increased tariffs. Honestly, I don't know which way this will go.So, if you see a good deal, book it. Who knows what is to come.I'm looking for March. My husband has vetoed summer, but I still have my fingers crossed."
"Mike hopefully it will pick up once the first visitors have come and gone and posted their experiences and we will see how they European holiday season goes. This will tell us if the beaches everywhere can be opened safely.. People are scared and will have to gain their confidence back. The herd mentality I guess. At least I can get toilet paper now.Here in Ontario the state of emergency is being extended until June 28. Businesses overall are reopening and finding out how to work in the new normal. Things are not as they were. Some masks but people are social distancing and staying safe mostly.The people who think they are entitled and invincible are still around and I’ll leave that at that.Government is really piling on the advertising for staycations so that will affect the DR some I think.As for the Quinte area you wouldn’t recognize it probably it was growing a lot . Prince Edward Coumty is turning into the new Muskoka for TO people but that is for another forum.The jest of my post is as the DR opens as other places do if it is not a tourist based economy it is doing so cautiously and if like others it is opening faster I hope the Covid 19 cases stay manageable because if not we are in a pile of you know what .Stay safe and happy travels when your turn comes.Hopefully the business picks up MileSteveEdited: 8:23 am, June 03, 2020 "
"This is my opinion only but after being home for 3 months already, I am looking forward to getting out of here and unless the initial reports are very negative once travel resumes in PC, I will return. Of course I do feel bad for those who have lost their jobs and maybe struggling but after retiring from the army after 32 years, travelling is one of the few things I have left to look forward to. I am thankful I still have a job and can afford a vacation. As things are slowly reopening, I hope that those who are struggling will be able to get back on their feet. I'm also looking forward to returning to PC and helping out by showing my support that way."
"Hey Sly, nicely worded in post 134, totally get where you are coming from there."
Cheers Pickleh.
"We are booked for Dec,.May and next year in Dec . Hope things are OK for this Dec. All refundable with no payments up front so just watch and see what happens now. I think it will be slow until a vaccine,"
"Unfortunately things are about to get uglier in the US. Our lovely president just listed a ban on China flights coming into the US. This might have repercussions around the globe. With this, and CV19 getting ready for flare up version 2.. I’m getting anxiety. I hope I’m wrong"
The flight ban to China which is tied into the Hong Kong moves by China is also related to China still banning US airlines from flying into China.
"Wildcat.. it’s about to go deeper than that... this whole border war crap using Covid as an excuse is getting old. When CV19 spikes again, some will take credit for putting early measures in place... ugh"
Its clear despite claims that Trump did not put early measures in place as we are indeed heavily impacted here. Beyond that he received warnings on C19 clear back in November of last year from the CIA that they were seeing a disease in China and his close China advisor Peter Navarro who worked on his trade deal there was warning of severe consequences for the US in January and the need to shut things down.
Isn't this a travel forum. Enough politics are on TV if you haven't had enough.
I agree enough politics from this Trump supporter! This forum is about travel.
I agree keep the politics for the Washington Post or NY Times Forum! This is for travel and even if we cannot do it right now let's just talk positive about through future of DR and give past experiences for advice to us future DR newcomers!
I was not making a political statement at all. I was saying the US could have closed its borders sooner and shut the virus down far more than it did so we would not have been impacted. I also voted for Trump by the way as far as that goes. Clearly you like to construe politics in anything someone says. I also explained the reasoning behind todays new travel ban on Chinese airlines which is totally travel related.

Wow.
Mark you should be ashamed of your rant and delete it.
"MHEATH1964 thanks there was no political agenda in my post only that we could have closed the border sooner to prevent the spread of this virus. As any responsible voter would do I am taking into consideration the various options which were not ideal last time.

Atta boy MHEATH! well said!
"Alright alright I know folks are just excited about the announcement LOL (see 145 and other post) so to bring this back to the OP, I just took a look at the July prices and saw many reductions in price for packages (from here) since yesterday. Not sure the announcement had anything to do with this. Anyhow, will be nice if/when this announcement is ""officially"" official.Edited: 10:50 pm, June 03, 2020 "
I thought July 1st had already been decided. Why is this new news?
Wasn't official. Still pending Phases going according to plan. Airport and air travel are in Phase 4 but looks pretty much a given now.
SlyGuy23 Great news on the opening. BUT until Canada and now the UK remove the 14 days when you go back home. Can't see many going from those 2 countries no matter how cheap it might be.
"Yes CT. I'm not looking to go until late September but of course I've already said that i wouldn't go if i need to quarantine on my return. Hence, me being happy that things are likely moving along in July. Hoping that Canada can follow suit after the restrictions expire on June 21st."
"Sly<< Phases going according to plan. Airport and air travel are in Phase 4 but looks pretty much a given now. >>I read that the director of the Dominican Institute of Civil Aviation, Alejandro Herrera, said only as long as there are no spikes in the levels of contagion that airports would open.Caribbean<< BUT until Canada and now the UK remove the 14 days when you go back home. >>Not only that but the UK has still got an FCO advisory in place for no non-essential travel. That would have to be lifted/changed too before we could fly.Angie."
Thought the other thread had the UK removing quarantine restrictions on the DR as well as 40+ other nations many of them vacation locations.
"Angie, that's what I mean by phases going according to plan. And for the record, TA deleted my new thread about the announcement. So much for positive, informative travel news.Edited: 10:49 pm, June 03, 2020 "
Angelina52 Same as Canada. Full do not travel warning to anywhere. Until that is lifted try to get travel insurance.
Thank you Sly that is good news!

"More positive info, Phase 2 came into effect yesterday and Phase 3 should start on 17 June. Phase 4 is when the airport should open up (hopefully on July 1st)."
"Luke Sky-Traveler here! Phasers set to 4! Nice to travel to DR, it will be! I know 2 different characters in the same movie! Safe and Happy Travels to All!"
That is positive news Sly!
Incredible. Some folks actually flag posts with positive news. I'm guessing the prospect of the DR reopening and folks having the ability to travel again is not what the TA community is looking for.
Cheers Rainforest. Are you looking to travel this year?
Nice. Mexico is already re-opening this month I believe. Visited Excellence Playa Mujares a few years back. Very nice.
Loved EPM and ERC! Secrets Akumal was great too but prefer beach at SCC.
SCC does have the best beach I've seen in any resorts.
"Much appreciate TA reinstating post providing positive update on the potential resumption of air travel and resorts opening as part of the DR plan. I'm sure many are looking forward to returning to PC and this information should prove helpful. Furthermore, 2 more airlines announced the resumption of their operations in July as provided on the PC Airport Update thread. Truly hopeful that things go according to plan."
Cheers MD. Hope you are safe and get to visit PC soon.
Thanks. Is this to travel to Cyprus or is this an agency? I have been to Cyprus and would love to go back. Paphos and Larnaca very nice.
Latest new protocols (from AMresorts) will include an affidavit of health from guests. No indication as to the use of the affidavit in case of positive test but puts pressure on guests I'm assuming.
"I heard on the news already few tims that Cyprus offers free testing, free care and money back for people who get sick on vacation I think it shows how desperate thy are for tourists. Im still planing Punta Cana this summer if posible but have credit till March"
"Rainforest.....No, sadly we have to wait until October."
"Absolutely, Rainforest! I am hoping the many Americans who read and don't post will follow suit. Re the RM...love it there. Sadly, the sargassum chased us away.Sly, As I said from my very first post, this is an excellent thread topic. TY for keeping it up."
Most PC resorts now offer packages starting at various times in July. Did notice that there are zero direct flights available until the fall though. Prices slightly down including high season in the new year.
"I know that in the summer we have pretty much zero direct flights but starting in the fall it never was an issue but this year, even in December and January I am seeing mostly connex flights through Montreal and TO. Very different right now. Hoping that it will change gradually once air travel resumes with potentially the addition of many flights. Right now, only seeing AC and SW packages all the way to April. Really looking forward to June 21st to see if Borders and air travel will resume.Edited: 2:24 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"Not sure yet what will happen in the DR,,but here is a hint at things to come maybe,,seen a deal for Maldives .. Reethi Faru resort in Maldives, $1180 for 7 nights for 2 people including meals .. this is a travel voucher good for 1 year, black out dates where Christmas and new years does not include flight i checked flights for different times ranged from 700 - 1000 pp from pearson in Torontoalso does not include alcohol, you can either bring your own or drink at resort , lets value that at the costing of 150 per day per couple thats roughly 2000 pp or 4 grand a couple for a week in Maldives all in,, that has always been like a 10 g trip https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g133…is it a sign of things to come, hard to say, time will tell .. however I did find it interesting"
Yeah now that would be worth it for sure. Cheaper than going to Excellence this winter.
With the announcement from LifeStyle Group that they are open for business August 1st up on the North Coast I was curious to see availability and prices for PP compared to PC once things open up. Was very surprised that there is pretty much nothing available from Ottawa until October but lots from Montreal. And prices right up to next spring are very good so that may attract those who would normally go to PC or new visitors to the DR.
"We couldn't get a direct flight out of PHL via AA. We have to connect via MIA(hate MIA airport) to PUJ. Mind you, we are starting out of PHL at 5:00 a.m. On the way home, we have a layover in Charlotte, NC. It is a gorgeous airport.I strongly dislike layovers. We haven't flown via a layover in over 10 years.Re the price, we used miles. We need to use them before AA declares bankruptcy.Jet Blue did have direct flights."
"Hi Northern-Ale, #195 post and the part on alcohol...... ""you can either bring your own or drink at resort"".Sorry but The Maldives is a Muslim country and you cannot take alcohol in. As you say though, you can of course drink at the resort in bars and restaurants.Still looks a great deal though may I add."
Hey Prize. I'm still hoping there will be more direct flights coming once air travel resumes. I would rather drive an hour and a half to Montreal than take a connecting flight. Mind you it isn't as bad in the fall as no chance of winter weather impacting flights.

"I absolutely prefer connecting flights. Gives me a chance to unwind after a long first leg, also... that’s what got me to my EP status with AA... yeah, things can go wrong but it’s the nature of the beast. No big deal"
"Gotta say I'm enjoying reading this on a wet sunday afternoon over here in the UK. It's making me smile about the flights issue especially. You guys need to come try a 9 hour non-stop from Birmingham to PUJ with very little options lol!! Now there's pain, I'm telling you."
"Wawooha... Ditto on AA status. I have mobility issues, so the layovers will be an issue. Thankfully, we can track luggage via the APP and we fly Business and First. I just can't understand why no non-stop from PHL of all places. We did consider driving to Dulles or Charlotte. But, we will do what we have to do to get there in October."
"Yep that's true RF55, minumum of 14 nights for us. Hoping for 18-21 days in late Nov to early Dec to make up for disappointment we had upcoming. We should be packing for a wedding in Cyprus on the 20th of this month, were due to fly out the 10th for 14 days. Almost 40 people, 2 years in the making to sort out. All I can say though is we are both well and healthy. Company I work for makes Valves for Ventilators so been crazy busy there and my wife works in a care home so both front line workers as such."
"Hey Pickle, not sure if you have seen the new normal protocols ICAO is proposing which includes no or limited bathroom use. Be a tad uncomfortable on a 9 hours flight so hoping these will not apply to long distance flights... lol. I have travelled around the world a few times and lived in Australia so I'm familiar with 15 hours flights. Not much fun but at least today planes have wi-fi and individual TVs. Back then we had nothing other than the old small ceiling screens for all to watch Disney movies."
"I have to do connecting flights and I think it will become necessary to book so that if your flight gets cancelled you are able to get on another flight quickly. I usually fly into Charlotte and will be sure to book an early flight so that if a flight is cancelled then I can still get on another flight to make my connection. Never book last flight of the day. Don""t want overnight layovers. I am sure that airlines will have trouble deciding which flights will fly till things get back to some type of normal and will be a lot of last minute flight cancellations."
Remember a trip to PP with connections in TO. My suitcase didn't make it until 2 days later... urghhh. Good thing I always pack a few things in my carry on backpack.
"Hi Sly, nearly wasted some of my beer reading that about the toilets lol. Hadn't give that a thought but had seen some stories on it. At my age, I'm gonna struggle with the NO use, limited I may get away with it."
I always pack for a day in carryon for both swimming and nighttime. Luggage has been lost a couple times. Usually arrived next day.
"Me too BBGamer with the carry on items, swimwear and at least one change of light clothes. Even on direct flights from the UK, I've heard of luggage being lost.I've also been stood like many I guess, waiting at PUJ for luggage to come off a flight for over an hour, thinking the worst as the carousel goes round and round, then stops, then restarts.

Out on the plains of Kansas there is no such thing a direct flight out of the country. We can barely get direct to Dallas or Atlanta to connect...ha!ha!So we just accept our fate and connect. But I am with you it does break it up and give you a chance to stretch and walk around your connecting airport.
Wife and I always divide our clothing up between his and her suitcase..One gets lost. We both still have ample clothing and such to get by.
Even if they lost my luggage it would be worth it these days. Besides my wife would let me borrow one of her bikinis! Then everybody else there would have no problem social distancing from me!
"DR still looking at July 1st to get things reopened but at about 30% initially. Predicting increased occupancy to 70 % by December.

"Prize.. that is strange.. funny story, last December we were flying from VA to Philly to PC. The day before we were supposed to fly was rainy and miserable. I had a bad gut feeling and my wife let me go with it. I had some free car rentals, we Called the EP line and a great rep cancelled my VA to Philly leg. We packed fast, drove up to Philly in a driving rainstorm, using Hilton points we stayed at the Doubletree airport. Boarded the direct that left at 8:20 AM.. got to PC right on timeHad we stayed with our original plan, the flight from VA wound up being cancelled (Gut was right and my wife was mad because I was right) . We would have had a double connection thru Miami getting to PC at almost midnight instead of 1:30 PM. She wasn’t so mad about that. That’s where we absolutely needed the direct. Normally.. noPhilly usually has direct.. strange that they don’t have one yet! With your mobility issues, I can certainly understand your direct need. Hope it works out for ya -~ A"
Looks like Canadian will have to look at late July or August at the earliest to return to PC as government looking to extend non-essential travel restrictions and border closure another month.
"LOL... Last I saw him, he was walking on the hill with thousands of people... but they fined a restaurant owner for having a few folks on his patio waiting for their take-out food. As for the borders, they always refer to restrictions between US and Canada but it does apply to all travel. Not sure if we would see international travel resume while US/Canada border still closed but very unlikely.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-us-bor…"
"Just taking a look at prices for resorts opening up in July and was curious to see if the new Dreams Macao Beach was ready and what kind of price they would charge. It is set to open July 7th but would cost over $2,000 for a week from here. Looks very nice though. Kinda has the same layout as the new Hyatts in Cap Cana (U shaped facing the beach)."
"Sly.. this is one of the grievances I have with the tour operator credits.. the credit should not be based on dollar, should be you have the ability to have flight and hotel with date at your discretion IE: I had pool view Dreams Macao booked for 7 days in April 2020 for 1400 pp Canadian Dollarswill probably never get the opportunity for this resort at that price againwhatcha gonna do ,,,lol"
"Wow, and yes, totally agree. That is the basis of that big class action suit against tour operators. Unless you are willing to travel during very low season and wait until prices match (in some case like you they may never) then you are out of pocket unless you use the credit for a lower end resort. This is why I am not booking anything for September until everything is up and running and I get to read the fine prints just in case things get shut down again after I book.Edited: 10:04 am, June 18, 2020 "
Yeah I think they already opened in March. They were only open a few weeks before the shutdown maybe a month at most obviously your talking about the re-opening here though.
"We just booked 7 nights at Secrets Cap Cana for October; with R/T air from Indianapolis, we paid $2,400. Crazy good price compared to when we've priced it other years...it's always been over $4k."
"I'm guessing $2,400 for 2? That is a good price."
"Is that price per person or for both? Also is that a package, through what company? Thanks"
Is that for regualt room or preferred?
mcd630 can you give some more details on that deal please? Just doing some flight searches throughout October for IND-PUJ return come in at around 520 dollars each. Just interested in seeing what deals people are getting at present. Thanks
"So looking at Hyatt in late July when things reopen. How about close to $5,000 for a week! So much for trying to attract new business...."
"Wow Sly, is that just the hotel price? Even if it is with flights that is taking.... ""the stuff we do when we've had a few too many drinks"""
That is with flights but per person... spilled my beer when I saw that....
Wow .. $5000 p/p that is steep for a week. Better of renting a condo and staying for a couple of months or more
"Wawooha....Doubletree? I will have to give it some thought. Our departure requires us to be at the airport at basically in the middle of the night. We have considered a hotel stay. We figured we can park the car and get a shuttle. Sly....I just received a promo from Hyatt. Resort only for 7 nights with a Swim up Jr Suite was $2777. A fab price in comparison to what we will pay at EEC. (Room is smaller than EEC and no EC which we love, or I would switch)Can you book flight separately?"
"Sly, is your departure from Montreal or Toronto?"
"Sly, Aug. 3rd from Quebec has th Hyatt Cap Cana at 1900 flight and resort with Sunwing. On the same date you also have Secrets Cap Cana and Excellence for 1850. I know that Quebec is further out for you but the small airport, few cases of Corona in the region might be worth it."
"Daisy I'm looking at Ottawa departure but yes, incredible as Aug 3rd would be $1,819. What a difference. Guess they dont want anyone in July... Prize, I always book package as resorts are in $US and with the exchange, not worth it unless a free flight."
Not really Cat. Still looking at late September which would be almost 3 months into reopening so time to evaluate how things are running. Plus prices for CHIC are very good for September.

Up you go...bump
"Some additional options popping up today. WJ now available from early August (from Ottawa). However, nothing until October from SW and November from AT. Very limited departures/flights from Ottawa until then and pretty much all connex flights."
"Please be careful booking with Cdn airlines... ""we've"" found quite a bit of phantom flights lately, people book, pay, airline cancels, flight date paid for disappears and only gives you back a voucher, then hiking the price... just be careful and don't book til you know it's a sure thing."
Deb any progress with your cancelled trip?
"Deb is on a mission!As for canceling and charging more, I just checked flight prices from August through next MAy for Winnipeg to Punta Cana. The price is almost constant, with a few dollar variance. Average is $560usd, which historically is considered a decent price for that flight. Unfortunately Deb, you keep on mentioning the package price as what went up. If the airfare is constant, how can you blame the airline? They only get you there and bring you back. Perhaps you have to look at the resort as the culprit. for your price changes."
"Mike, as I pointed out on another thread, prices (for packages) are an issue as it seems tour operators charge what they want and we can't see the breakdown. If flight prices are consistent, what justifies Hyatt to charge $4,700 per person week of 1st July then under $2,000 the following weeks. For us Canadians, it is normally cheaper to buy a package as resort fees are in US$ so not normally cost effective. But when trips are canceled at a certain price it ca be difficult to get it again at the same price hence some of the complaints on here."
"Sly, I just checked Hyatt's website and the property is not available for July 1st. The state ""temporarily suspended operations. Resuming operations expected July 22, 2020""."
Well this is what is showing but doubtful anyone would book it anyway... lol.https://www.tripcentral.ca/vacationgrid/…
"Third party site. If you want it from the horse's mouth...go to the resort's website. Plus, when you search a nonstop flight from Ottawa to PUJ for that date, nothing shows up.Edited: 10:01 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Yes, I spoke to a Reservations Supervisor over the phone last week for the Hyatt Cap Canas. They aren't opening until July 22. It is on their official website and the Playa Resorts website as well."
There are no non-stop flights from Ottawa until the fall so no point searching that.
"Even connecting through YYZ (Air Canada), the first flight is scheduled for July 18th."
Yes that was pointed out in the thread from CT. That will likely not happen either.
"https:/…some interesting tidbits in the above article...come December we should have a better picture of what tourism will look like world wide,and it probably isn't going to be pretty,there was one article I read a short time ago, that analyst say it will take 10 plus years to get air travel back to 2018-2019 levels, they were basing their theory on many aspects, lets hope they are wrong"
"Yes MIke, I'm on a mission, as you already know :-) I'm fighting for the little guys. Many airlines ARE taking bookings for phantom flights.Yes, my ""personal""l beef is regarding packages. My price, same resort, same time-frame has gone from $1140 to $2769 PER person.Mike, I hear and understand what you are saying, if the flights are the same and I say IF then you ""think"" the resorts are upping their charge? Not the case at all, the tour operators are doing it... and guess what Westjet owns Westjet Vacations, Sunwing owns Sunwing Vacations, AC own Air Canada Vacations, so, yes, it's the airlines in charge. If you think for one minute that any of these up charges or raising the price is going to the resorts then I've got that proverbial bridge for ya ;-)Sit back and let them rip of the consumer is NOT going to help air travel or tourism at this point.*edited for spelling :-)Edited: 1:45 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"Good article Northern. Was chatting with a friend of mine this morning (she's a TA) and we were discussing the current essential travel only direction from the Government (and potential flights to PC on July 18th) but I was surprised to hear that flights to Las Vegas, Jamaica and Cancun have already resumed or will shortly. How does that work under essential travel only directions..."
"Do you think for one minute in the effort to recoup losses that doubling the price (as in my case) is going to make a consumer take that offer, or would they want their money back for goods/services not rendered? It would be the same scenario if any excursion seller is now going to double their prices to recoup their losses... very few, if any consumers would book those excursions... right?And don't give me that ""covid-19"" upcharge either that some places are trying to charge.... planes, airports, bathrooms, vehicles, hair/nail salons, dentists, doctors etc. should of been cleaning longggg before Covid ever came along :-) Heck my dentist and hygenist have been wearing masks for years when dealing with patients :-)"
"I didn't read the whole article, I've read soooo much the last little while.It'll take a long time for tourism/travel to get back as you said, but there are so many factors involved and the article only shows a few. First they need to restore faith in the consumers.It kinda cracks me up that the Cdn Airlines are ""pressing"" our Gov't to open up the borders for travel, when JT himself and good ol Tam says keep our borders closed, stop non-essential travel, provinces don't even want their inter-provincial borders open, BUT the airlines don't seem to think Tam is right, or is it they don't care about safety, or just their $$$. Who knows what's right or wrong, safety, at this point... but you've now got the Cdn airlines telling the Cdn Gov't what to do... I didn't know it worked that way LOLMe, I can't wait to travel again, but I don't want it to be so expensive that only rich people can afford it."
"just booked thru air canada vacations.. sept 28th for 7 nights...corner swim up room at our beloved ambar. 1329 each. i paid 100 down for each..final payment not due until 25 Days before trip so sept 3... i also paid the insurance premium that they have available until june 30...59 dollars.. makes all you deposit refundable until 25 days prior to trip..so worst case.. we cancel 25 days before and are out 59 dollars each. ONLY reason we will cancel is if the rule is still in place for 2 weeks quarantine. /// hopeful to get to ambar in late septEdited: 2:35 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"the 59 dollar insurance is nothing new,most companies have been offering this for years,I do it as its a no brainer, with transat you can cancel upto 3 hrs before trip along with other perks involved the 59 dollars is rather inexpensive that being said Im curious as to only being available to june 30th? are they ending this program?"
"Agree that prices in September are amazing Lynn. Looking at $1,300 for CHIC, no single supplement same week as you. I'm just waiting for the first flight to touch down to make sure things are running smoothly (as much as possible)."
People used that insurance to cancel during covid and were still denied refunds to the original form of payment... be careful.
"Deb,, that insurance has always had a prorated value, cash vs credits depending how close to date of travel you cancel"
"Actually Lynn... the fine prints says...45 days or more prior to departure, $250 per person will be given in in-house credit and the remaining balance of the total price will be refunded in the original form of payment; 44 to 21 days prior to departure, 50% of the total price will be given in in-house credit and 50% will be refunded in original form of payment; 20 days to 3 days prior to departure, 100% of the total price will be given in in-house CREDIT.The downside of credts/vouchers is if the prices rise... I am hoping that by then they realize people can't keep rebooking at higher prices with devalued vouchers.I can't wait to get ""moving"" again :-)"
Deb..the difference is...that with this new policy..we do not have to pay balance till 25 days before vacation... so worst comes to worst.. if they only credit us the 100 each...we are only out 59 each... a risk we are willing to take.
"Deb, Im thinking and hoping, that the pricing we are seeing now, will change once travel resumes again,im guessing that no one really wants to play the numbers game till they actually known how,when, and every other question you can throw out there"
"Exactly northern,,, and I hope everyone moves forward with caution when booking :-)"
"nope deb..you are wrong..this is a diff policy for purchase. we paid 100 dollars each deposit..plus the 59 each insurance.. nothing else due till 25 days before vacay.. look here https:/…Edited: 3:06 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"just for fun , have a look at this webcam http://www.cuatesycuetes.com/its a tourist area of Puerto Vallarta very interesting social studies here, face masks versus no face masks.. heheits going to make travel very interesting Trudeau sees this he wont let any of us out of Canada ever,,Deb speaking of Trudeau and Tam.. this is my faith in them, if 2 vaccines are made available vac A and Vac Band tam recommends A ,, Im going with B"
Couldn't agree more about Tsm. She was wrong on everything. Little faith in government before this...nil now.
"Lynn, I hop I am wrong... but, but, but,,, check this link out.. then read what the tiny little notes for 4 & 5 are after in the Terms & Conditions... there's always Terms, there has to be, it's the law....https:/…travel-protection"
"Northern, pretty scary eh... Tam is some kinda special isn't she LOL Even Trudope disobeyed her and went across the provincial border for a weekend getaway then went out into a crowd to join protesters"
"Gregnlynn, I asked Transat if I was responsible for the balance if I canceled before my final payment was due, and I was. By booking, I am responsible for the complete price, must pay my balance and am subject to same cancellation policy as everyone. However, having taken that 59$ insurance multiplee times, you can easily rebook, but cancelling is different, you can do it but are given a voucher. Of course, I could be wrong. Since the Covid issue, policies might have changed."
Sadly rules seem to change even after booking. Truly hope those first flights happen so we can see how things will operate.
"so here is a big issue I have with the voucher systemmy voucher is with transat , a hotel im interested in, is 200 dollars per person less with another operator so that is a one hard to blame on the hotel"
"ok , so i just checked with our travel agent and also air canada vacations. Careflexplus plan for 59. pp gives you the right to rebook, change dates or CANCEL for 100% refund up to 25 days before flight. Also until June 30 there is only 100 dollar deposit. Final payment is 25 days prior (always been 45 days prior to covid)"
"Yeah, those famous vouchers. Not much flexibility with those and in most cases, folks end up loosing out."
"Lynn, I truly hope the website and the terms & conditinos are indeed lying and that you are correct!!! Any chance you can get that or have that in writing, or is it on the contract/invoice you received when you booked ? I would love to be able to spead that great news if it's true... thanks.100% refund may be true, but is that cash back or with a credit voucher or some percentage combination? I copied exactly what ACV website said yesterday and posted here."
"Just to give more DP with the vouchers...I booked my brother's round-trip flight on Westjet from Toronto to PUJ using my credit card. A few days ago, Westjet canceled the inbound flight but left the outbound flight. You already know that this isn't useful. I already anticipated that WestJet would say that they are only doing vouchers, but I called anyway. Yes, they said they are only giving vouchers AT THIS TIME, even though they were the ones that canceled that flight. Knowing that there is no need to go back and forth. I said thank you to the Westjet rep, hung up, and called my credit card company. I filed a chargeback/cc dispute. I have no time & patience to fight with Westjet. My brother wound up getting a round trip ticket from Buffalo to PUJ.Edited: 2:36 pm, June 22, 2020 "
Good job Cat. Our once beloved Wesjet has turned into just another airline with less happy customers every day. How much time do you have to call your CC company? I'm wondering why all the disgruntled guests didn't do that instead of getting vouchers? Does it depend on CC company or what? I'm not in that situation now but would be helpful to know.
"Good for you Cat !!!The reason many people didn't go the chargeback route is they truly believed the airlines and vacation companies when they cited some obscure rules... when in fact their own Tariffs say otherwise. Sadly some people just don't know their rights.WJ, AT, AC have all been pulling that stunt lately, take your booking, take your money then cancel one portion of the flight and still only offering vouchers. They will ask if YOU want to cancel the other portion of your flight, thus not enabling you to a refund or the right to pursue a chargeback.Chargebacks are taking anywhere from 45 to 120 days, on average.Lots of info here... https:/…"
"Rainforest,No lie, I was on hold with WestJet for about 90 min to speak to a rep. Yes, I said NINETY, smh. The call to my credit card company took about 7 min from start to finish. I'm not sure why people don't dispute with their cc. Maybe people probably feel that this step is a hard process or they think that they have to submit so much proof/evidence for their case. I have a premium travel card that is with Amex. I know they have been great with other disputes in general. I'm not sure if other credit card companies are better than others, but in my experience, Amex has always had my back."
Good to know Cat!
"Debinatore, yes that is crazy!!! I couldn't believe it when I saw they only canceled the outbound. Definitely bamboozlement and tomfoolery. It's like setting the customer up to just cancel the flight, so the fault will be on the customer. I made sure that I explained to Amex. If my brother can't get to PUJ from Toronto on WestJet, there is no point in having that return flight."
"Cat S. it's actually quite disgusting what the airlines are doing right now... they are trying to gather up money but I think they're going about it all wrong as it doesn't instill good faith :-(Thankfully, more people are learning what to watch for when booking. I've also been told that anyone booking with vouchers will have to look hard for insurance, for some reason they don't want to cover them."
"Air Canada just came out with new promo with deals 50% off. Place like El Beso El Faro under $1,000. Many good options in months to come."
Slyguy ... That would be a great deal ... Maybe hold off https:/…
"Thanks JO71AL. My Spanish is a little rusty though... LOL. Still, I'm not sure if this would impact tourism per say. No mention in this article. Ultimately, I have not booked yet and my plans are still for late September so things can change a few times until then."
"Prices are low right now while they try to attract guests. But I also think we will find limited staff and limited restaurants opened , and other services what were usually available. As they increase the number og guests for the future I think they will also increase prices to try to make up for their losses."
"Prices from Canada are not low right now,hopefully as flights resume prices will adjust accordingly :)"
"For what months Northern? I'm seeing some decent prices until XMas. Prices after that aren't low but have seen a slight decrease for January and February. For example, Dreams Macao prices are way down in new year."
Now onyx out of Toronto for November is crazy price with Transat. But I want to use my credit up with them
"I'm seeing around $1,400 for November. I'm looking at Onyx in late September and it's about the same."
I thought AT cancelled all flights til 2021?
"debinator, they cancelled from the Western provinces. They are still flying from Torontoand Montreal https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-transat…Edited: 8:13 pm, August 03, 2020 "
AT keeps changing their minds
Yes definitely some AT flights from TO but nothing from Ottawa yet. Also not seeing any WJ yet also but AC and SW back in business too.
As the covid case numbers rise the airlines want restrictions lifted.... $$$$
Yes $$$ for sure. Numbers in Canada been going down but agreed that it is not the case everywhere. Hawaii just lifted their 14 days quarantine rule to allow Canadians to visit as long as you have a valid test.
"During and Post covid things will cost more, we must get used it. i hit the dentist last week and was pinned $15 for PPE, my wife $25 for her appointment. Not covered in current insurance plans. Got a haircut, takes about 10mins, its now $30, prior it was $20. The world of have and have nots is growing, and you can move from one side to another pretty fast these days!"
"Oh you're so right J... not sure I like the gouging though. (As for dentists that wore masks and cleaned before covid I don't agree with the ""aerosol"" charge, I shopped around and found some that aren't charging it and ended up with a great new dentist)"
"Still looking at prices last week of September in case I do travel and prices have gone way down for that week. Ambar under $1,000 right now. SCC for about $1,400. Dreams Macao for about $1,100. Great deals for that week if looking to travel late September."
We have a 'credit' of $6000 with ACV. But for sure no travel before Jan for us. #bummer
"here is AIr Transat latest statement on traveling, credits and incentives https:/…124324"
On thing with prices to verify is the rate is including all inclusive as some resorts particularly AM Resorts properties have started putting out hotel only rates with optional all inclusive being quite a bit higher.
For us prices are for flights and resort (AI) as a package. Even includes transfer.
Yeah I figured that was the case for Canadian tour companies as well as those out of the UK but US/online booking sites they are quoting some resorts as rooms only mostly the AM Resort properties. I am surprised yours includes transfers as well though as I had thought only the European tour companies had that as well. I guess mainly since many of the Canadians here had made their own transfer arrangements.
"We booked in February, prior to the announcement regarding the current pandemic. Our travel is scheduled for December, 2020. The price of our hotel has decreased from what we paid in February. We were able to cancel our initial reservation, and get the reduced price."
"Well done Reggie. Many may go this route if able to. Unfortunately, many are stuck with vouchers which limit their ability to re-book but with prices seemingly on the way down, maybe some may also enjoy nice resorts at a reduced price until things pick up again."
They aren't paying people back in cash but being able to use your voucher credit and book at the lower price should leave you with some credit left to use for something else. I have a credit still from my airline after my flight to the DR was cancelled and I rebooked a trip to Mexico the flight to Cancun was only about 65% as much so I still have a credit left from the DR flight that I can use. You just have to watch the expiry dates on the vouchers/credits. In my case it was good for 1 year from the date the flight was cancelled though I am thinking of using the rest at Christmas towards a flight then.

"As prices continue to go down (I could travel to CHIC last week of September for under $1,000 - awaiting official confirmation of re-opening on 24th of September), seems like the biggest factor keeping most from going is the 14 day quarantine on return. That is certainly what is keeping me from booking but with prices as they are and in real need of a vacation, I might make it work. https:/…"
"Sly, only thing keeping me from going is the medical insurance covering covid. No problem with quarantine since we aren't working."
Sly ... Does that include airfare?
"Yes this was also mentioned and a valid point too. Seems like more and more resorts are offering COVID coverage as to attract travellers. As more resorts open, this could be more frequent and allow most to have coverage."
"I saw similar from the US. Direct non-stop flights 11 days at the Bahia Principe Ambar, upgraded room to swim out, upgraded private airport transfers $1300 pp. I jumped on it and leave next week. My state doesn’t require a mandatory quarantine upon return but I will do one anyway. I can work from home."
"JO71AL, CHIC currently priced at $899 (regular luxury room) out of Montreal departure Sept 24th. This includes flight, resort and transfers with Air Canada. Also no single supplement at the resort if travelling solo. Will never beat this price again. Diamond Club Ocean View suite priced at $1,179. I'm really itching to hit the button.... LOL."
"Yes, I'd have to read the fine prints of coverage offered by resorts/travel groups but I'd be inclined to get coverage for home too. Believe resort coverage is included when you book with them.Edited: 1:45 pm, August 13, 2020 "
Sly ... Wow ..super deal. Tough decisions.
"Yes very good prices. Just catching up on new cancellation rules and policies to see what's new. I might go ahead and book anyway as most will allow cancellation with ""full refund"" and lower deposit."
"full ""cash"" refund? Highly doubtful... WESTjet and AC are still being (*&*&^&^^$##). I have heard from so many people that have booked with them and then the airlines cancel on them, some in as little as 2 hours after they've booked... NO REFUNDS, just lousy coupons. BEWARE and don't forget to quarantine for another 14 days once you get home to Canada."
"Air Canada Vacations:For a limited time, book your winter vacation and get our CareFlexPlus travel protection plans for FREE •Cancel your reservation with a full refund up until 25 days prior to departure"

"No, medical coverage would have to be separate. Believe RBC provides some. Note that some resorts/groups have started offering free COVID coverage if you book with them. Palladium, RIUs and Club Med are some that I've seen."
"Some COVID-19 coverage is starting to pop up here and there, so far from Blue Cross Ontario, Blue Cross Quebec and B2C insurer Medipac."
"Sly, if you became ill with Covid while away, but didn't need to be hospitalized, would insurance cover extended stay if you weren't allowed to fly back or if morally you didn't want to board a plane knowing you have Covid? Would an extended stay under these circumstances be considered medical?"
"My understanding is that anything COVID related (such as what you described above and potential lock-down due to COVID where flights would be cancelled or country put on lock down again) would be covered under the COVID insurance. I certainly would read all the fine prints for that particular type of insurance before booking. Coincidentally, I was just reading an article that confirmed the top 2 reasons Canadians are not travelling right now is No1 - the 14 days quarantine rule on return to Canada, and No2, the lack or uncertainty with COVID insurance."
"Absolutely those are the reasons Sly. No2 for us since quarantine no problem. Our local ""Travel Lady"" was on TV stating the same thing."
"For me, still the 14 days quarantine. Although I could work from home, not sure I want to go through this after being home for 4 months. Was so happy to be back at the office, not sure I want to be stuck at home another two weeks with wife, son, cats.... LOL."
Haha I get it Sly!
"Sly, read the fine print on the ACV, that's not a CASH refund."
"Deb, CareflexPlus is new: ""Note 2 -CareFlexPlus plan cancellation policy: Cancellations are permitted up until 7 days prior to departure. The refund method depends on the number of days before the initial departure date: up until 25 days prior to departure, the package total price will be refunded in the original form of payment; 24 to 21 days prior to departure, 50% of the total price will be given in in-house credit and 50% will be refunded in original form of payment; 20 days to 7 days prior to departure, 100% of the total price will be given in in-house credit. Car rentals, excursions, theme park tickets and other attractions are non-refundable."
"exactly, the cash refund has to be more than 25 days out... and the way things keep changing the 25 days out is risky. I would rather spell out the so-called refund rather than have people think ACV is giving refunds with all packages. If you follow any of the airline groups / rights you will see what a headache they have been. AC is holding onto 2.3 BILLION in refunds when they are sitting on 9BILLION in the bank :-("
"Well it is still a cash refund... LOL. Anyhow, yes I am aware of the credits for most. My son has one that he may loose. Still having an option to cancel 25 days before with full refund instead of the 45 days which it was previously is a bit better. Unfortunately, doesn't make up for those stuck with credit voucher of course."
Airfares are bound to rise if 'planes are less than full.
"yes airfares will / are going up, as are packages. PS Sly, I won my Chargeback against Sunwing... using the law :-)"
"Good news Deb. As for prices, right now they are lower than I've seen in many years but, yes, would believe that at some point they will likely go up. Higher than previous years, I'm not sure but they certainly won't stay at the level they are at right now."
"Sly, I""m sure you're only checking the ""east"" departure prices... anything past Ontario we are being gouged... I think the Toronto (and close) departures are to consolidate and mitigate their losses :-)Get back to work Sly :-)"
"first the airlines were claiming cancellations and no refunds due to gov't ""advisory"" and now while the gov't ""advisory"" hasn't changed, the airlines are bucking the system amid the rising numbers of covid, mainly due to travel (greed)"
"Lunch time Deb... LOL. Yes, just saw that prices from the Peg are indeed higher. Must be because us in the east are lower maintenance... LOL. In the end, this is why I started this thread and right now, 3 months later with travel having resumed, prices are for the most part lower. Will have to see as we get close to winter and more folks travel what the trend will be."
"I will be booking with credits, so if my trip in April gets cancelled well i get credits,,pricing out of Toronto for AI packages Im interested in have really dropped, how long that lasts or goes down more is a guessIm assuming the resorts and or tour operators are looking for a influx in cash flow,"
"Sly, doesn't post #349 bother you or make you question things?"
"Missed #349 Deb after responding at #350 but to your point, operators have lost so much that they will of course bend the rules or make them up in their favour if they can for sure. Anything for them to start making money again. As for rising numbers, other than the US, i'm not as concerned as I was but watching closely. The DR just had it's 5 straight day with decrease and the last 24 hours was the lowest daily count since July 7th. Also, only 11 new cases in the PC area yesterday so all and all, seems to be trending in the right direction."
Thanks for your reply Sly #336. Certainly my top 2 reasons. As soon as there is talk of lifting the quarantine I am booking because prices will surely sore once that is announced.
My pleasure Daisy and you certainly make a good point about prices going up when quarantine rule removed.
