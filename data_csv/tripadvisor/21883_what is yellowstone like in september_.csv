"hi all,i had a 10 day trip to YNP and GTNP first week of june planned; unfortionately i am a nurse and need to help with the covid 19 pandemic and have a feeling we will still be battling this in june. Luckily i have 2 weeks of in September and i have been able to move most things/cancel most things (except i lost 100$ for cache house jackson hole, as it was non refundable). I am having some trouble finding lodging in the park (so dissapointing because i finally got it all sorted out for my june trip)- oh well! I digress---Just wondering what the park is like in september? i.e. weather (i know it is constantly changing but in your experience) best things to see and do in september. Is the park empty in middle of september- are thre still ranger hikes during this time? and any other tips for going off season (i am a solo traveller) i will be going September 15-26 (15-19 in YNP 20-22 GTNP 22-24 Jackson hole 24-26 in park city before i fly out of SLC) Thanks all!"
"You might want to join us on the Wyoming forum. https:/…ShowForum-g28973-i480-Wyoming.htmlThings begin to close down after Labor Day, but there are still people touring trying to avoid the crowds. The later in the month, the more likely to have wintry weather. It may be lovely, but will certainly be cold overnight, so be prepared to have lots of layers and for possible temporary road closures if conditions dictate. Have food and beverages along in the car as well. Dining options may be more limited in open hours.Cancellations happen, just keep watching and you did learn to watch the cancellation policies.Edited: 9:58 am, March 31, 2020 "
"Below is the link for fall ranger programs. I have been to Yellowstone two or three times in Sept. and enjoyed every trip. Was just there last year, though about a week earlier than you have planned. We stayed in Gardiner but have also stayed in park.https:/…YT19_Fall_Rangers_web.pdf"
"While this is last years schedule, I thought it would give you an idea of what is offered in the fall."
"Since you're from NJ you probably have some winter driving skills. There can be some wintry weather that time of year. Last year intermittent road closures started Sept 20 although in most years it's closer to Oct 5-6.I would not book anything that is not 100% refundable. While we all hope we'll be back to traveling this Fall, I'd not want to risk any more money than you've already lost.I agree with thbergs - keep looking at the Xanterra website for lodging. I think there will wind up being lots of cancellations so you should be able to get in park lodging.I almost always travel to Yellowstone solo and it's awesome. I do try to stay in park lodging to cut down on drive times. I ALWAYS wear bear spray, even when I walk the boardwalks in the geyser basin. I just looked back at your prior posts and see I did post on one of your previous threads on the Yellowstone forum with some suggestions. Do join us back on the Yellowstone forum!"
at the time you are traveling you can see snow/ its usually not a snow storm but an overnight dusting of a few inchesfall colors should be seen at that time. peak for grand teotn is usually the 27-30 in sept but it can vary. historically its about a 60/60 shot of getting some cold weather when there in late september where you have highs 65-70 vs highs just reaching 40
