"Has anyone had any recent dealings with Bookabach? Looking at Trip Advisor site there are some negative posts.We had an Easter holiday home booked for 3 couples. We booked last year and paid a substantial deposit, final payment paid early March.Their website states No Refund, credit only.BUT the government has now declared a state of emergency and put us into self isolation so we have had no option but to cancel.We are NOT interested in another Bookabach, we want a refund. One email intimated this would happen and then they all of a sudden changed their tune and amended this to credit.Has anyone else had problems with BOOKABACH? In these times when all other accommodation providers have given refunds these people are standing firm.Can anyone recommend how we should proceed. Come on Bookabach we didn’t cancel for the fun of it, we are in a serious situation. We want a full refund not a credit."
"Good luck on that - Bachcare has shown previously they really don't care.Take it to Fair Go, you won't be the only ones being shafted."
"We're having the same trouble. A house booked for April which is cost us over US$17,000 for a family group, no refund being offered at all. I don't know how they can justified keeping the $500 cleaning fee which won't be used."
"TS, that's dreadful. Take it to your local newspaper and TV One news and TV3 and take it to Fair Go. They shouldn't be allowed to operate this way."
also take it to the Commerce Commission - they have won against Bachcare previously and will likely be happy for round 2https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/11838064…
I seem to have been very lucky and have had a refund for a bach that we booked in Napier for Easter weekend. Perhaps it's dependant upon the property owner?
The OP has identified two different entities in their post. Is their grievance with Bachcare or Bookabach?I'd hate for an innocent party to be maligned on the forum because of similar names.
"Our beef isn't with bookabach, it's with the owner of the property. I have been encouraging my mother to email bookabach with her complaint though to see whether they can put the pressure on."
"Please be aware that Bookabach and Bachcare are two completely different companies, with different owners and different Ts and Cs."
Just to let everyone know re bookabach - they were bought out by Homeaway and there seems to be a HUGE issue with refunds over the Covid-19 period - being paid out - just have a look at nz.trustpilot.com! They are using all types of excuses for the non payment of refunds. Its usually not the actual homeowners issues - its with the bookabach/homeaway organisation themselves. I would suggest that anyone not being paid out in an efficient manner should take this further - perhaps by going to the commerce commission or newsmedia - Stuff News is where I might head if they dont pay me out shortly!!!!
TA are the same. dont use them. we had a holiday home booked and they took GPB310 non refundable fee for a four night stay. My first and last experience and time i ll be booking through TA.
"AirBnB went In the completely opposite direction & prioritsed guests over hosts. Guests got full refunds & hosts nothing, regardless of cancellation policies."
"Yes, we had around 15 reservations between March and June in NZ, Aus, and Greece... AirBnB gave 100% refund almost immediately and we have received all of our money back. BookaBach (HomeAway) less than 50% and only because the owner put in a request... This was for a place in Aus but same problem everywhere...I read an article that Airbnb really ticked off their owners by giving all those refunds to guests and not considering them, but guess what...they were smart. I (and I imagine many others like me) will be using Airbnb again as soon as I travel again. HomeAway, never again. Hopefully it was worth the $500 they kept."
"Obviously Air BnB have an eye on the future. Big enough and solvent enough to take the hit knowing that good business pays off.People remember good service.Edited: 5:35 pm, May 13, 2020 "
For completeness Bachcare took a significant investment from UK holiday home company Sykes Cottages about 12 months ago. It’s not a complete takeover and it’s not clear whether Sykes now has a controlling interest.Sykes has had a good reputation and is a significant player in the UK market but they have got a lot of stick recently with their insistence on offering rebooking rather than refunds for coronavirus issues. This may be showing in NZ as well.
With no cashflow at the moment paying out customers is not a priority and the next best thing is a credit for travel down the track as long as it is not too restrictive maybe till December 2021 would be a good offer.
"Thats a good point GTS. Just like airlines I guess. If all of a sudden you have to pay cash back could be enough to take some of these companies out.I have some sympathy. I usually go for the better ""no cancel"" price and bet on not having to cancel, and hope insurance will take care of any risk."
"Sorry- the rest of us have to balance our expenditures and revenues in life... I don't give a pass to these big businesses weather it is airlines or lodging chains or whatever.You didn't provide the service, you are getting bail outs, return the money."
Yes as long as you read the fine print regarding cancellations you should be right but people take out travel insurance right?.
"WRT #17 - it is not big business that is taking the hit here. We are NOT talking about hotel or motel chains but properties owned by private investors, often their sole investment. I know people who lost more than $1500 per week in the March-April period including Easter & school holidays. They still have mortgages, rates & insurance to pay. WRT #14, I hope Sykes Cottages isn’t as badly managed as Bachcare! I am surprised that Bachcare had the capital to invest outside NZ as they are only a management company, not the owner or operator of the holiday homes they represent."
"Re #19. Sorry to hear about your large loss nzp0ppy we were very lucky regarding our June Fiji holiday.All non refundable accommodation was allowed to be deferred to a later date and both Virigin (pre adminastration) and Qantas/Fiji Airways refunded in FULL all our airline costs.Edited: 5:27 pm, May 14, 2020 "
Zhuhai - it’s the other way round. Sykes has invested in Bachcare.
"Sorry, I missed the crucial word ""from"" in your post, John. I'm surprised that Bachcare has any significant assets to invest in. It seems a quite decentralised operation and I assumed that in each region it is a type of franchise. My neighbour (an absentee owner from the UK) flirted with the idea of AirBnB eventually chose Bachcare because she expected more ""care"", but has been disappointed with the lack of bookings."
I would guess that it was a plan to Provide funds to expand the business. That was 12 months ago though and the world is a very different place now.
