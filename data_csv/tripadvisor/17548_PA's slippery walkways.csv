Reviews on PA --- the last few make it sound like walking the grounds is dangerous. The walkways are so slippery people are always tripping and falling. Is there any truth to this or are these posts over the top?
anyplace that has wet marble floors is going to have falling people.
"Any place with Margaritas can have people falling too!! Seriously though I have been to places with marble floors and rainy weather and it can be a little treacherous.. we will be at PA Mar 30, so we'll see. Would never keep me from staying anywhere, but make sure flip-flops have good traction!"
"es its true. The concrete is highly polished and waxed, It is very slick. i was wearing Crocs and fell down all 8 steps right out the front door. I would recommend walking bare footed. I got decent traction that way. I was very sore and stiff for the remainder of my trip. It was nobodys fault but mine. they had warning signs up, although reason would say maybe they should consider a etch or something to rough the surface up."
"Wow, sounds painful! I wonder if they are doing something new? 'Been reading reviews about PA for a year with no mention of this and then suddenly 3 reviews with warnings! Well my hubby has a sick sense of humour and loves to see me go for a tumble. Men love slapstick, so at least it may make his vacation when I go flying down the stairs!"
We were at PA in Jan of 2010. Slipped a couple of time.
We were there in Jan of 2010 and I slipped a couple of times.
"It's slippery, but it's not that big of a deal, in my opinion."
"Yes, I have been wondering also. In all this time no mention of this and suddenly there seems to be an epidemic, lol. Just be careful everywhere on Isla. When it rains, even the sidewalks can be very slick."
"My wife and I were at PA last week, during the time it rained two separate times. The walkways can be slippery, but it largely depends on your footwear. My wife had to be careful while wearing flip flops, but if you're in shoes/sneakers with any kind of traction you'll be fine."
