"As The NY Times reported, everyone with a weekend house has decamped. In the Hamptons, while restaurants are closed, many places with takeout are operating for that. It,s supposed to be good weather for the next few days. Friday will be 55. Hotel/motel prices are relatively low ( if open). The Southampton Inn is $149/night for a double queen room."
"As of noon today, the governments of the Canada and the US will apparently be announcing that they are closing the borders to tourists. So, even though Montreal is only 6 hours away from New York City, it is no longer an option for anyone."
Not a local but travel has been on my mind. Too many risks in a hotel. Only thought I have is renting a lake house from a friend of a friend. I will have to confirm but I believe the virus can live on surfaces up to 3 days. I’d plan accordingly between guests (if she had others) and clean upon arrival anyway.
Remember that you do not want to go to some very isolated place in case you get sick and need medical care or a hospital.

Time and Again for some NYC time tripping.
Stay home. NYC will likely have better testing than elsewhere in NYS. Plus you’ll be doing everyone a favor by staying home to begin with.
Longwood Gardens closed some time ago which is sad for the spring flower displays many enjoy. I heard today that the massive King of Prussia Mall in PA will be closing. Some stores such as Macy's closed on their own.
To be honest I think its poor form to travel to other places and potentially spread the virus. Its one thing if you have a second home or family to go to etc but to go somewhere for the sake of taking a short holiday is just putting people at risk unnecessarily and maybe making it more difficult to control the spread of this thing.
"WTF? If this was anyone else''s post, I would assume it was a troll question (I thought it was a joke at first, frankly. But not funny). No one should be traveling because they're bored. No one should be putting themselves or anyone at risk by unnecessary exposure or interaction. No one has to worry about staying ""away from Risa"" because Risa is not risking anyone else's health by leaving her apartment. The Congressman for Staten Island fought his patooties off to have the next drive-through testing center on Staten Island and got his way for a reason, it's necessary. This isn't vacation time. It's an international crisis. If you don't already know someone with it, someone dying from it, or someone under risk/exposure quarantine because of it, then give it a day or two. You will.Follow the recommendations of our governor and stay TF home."
"In NYC most locals do not really have a backyard, so you are stuck inside. It isnt like the suburns where you could at least sit in your backyard and make a BBQ. I totally get why people would want to get out of Dodge"
"West Virginia now has 2 cases of the virus. Still better than most states.But Ziggy, if this is for your special milestone, have you considered contacting one of your favourite chefs and seeing what they can do for you? At these times I'm sure many would be able to put on a special meal for you and your group. To redeuce the costs for the restaurant, maybe you don't need servers? That would reduce the cost. I'm thinking a private meal for you and your guests, either in the restaurant itself or at your home (you have a house so probably have a full size kitchen?), with just the chef and maybe a sous chef and your guests."
"Aynat, ""guests""? Social distancing, if that's being practised means ""no guests"". At least that's what my children have insisted. I am not even ""allowed"" to have relatives bring me my birthday dinner. Is it different in OZ? In NYC?"
"""West Virginia now has 2 cases of the virus. Still better than most states."" They may have two confirmed cases but I would imagine they have many more actual cases. They don't have adequate testing there so in reality they just don't know how bad it is."
"No WEQ. It is not different in NYC. We are told no guests, no parties, no celebrations, no group funerals. Nothing. My nephew got engaged last Saturday night. There was a tiny celebration with the two immediate families, that is, I didn't go. Friends are setting up ""drink dates"" by FaceTime. I'm booked all week now. Which is no substitute for the reception I was supposed to be headed to at this very second in a beautiful Fifth Ave apartment with out presidential candidate, nor a replacement for the Lehman Trilogy which I was supposed to go to Saturday night. Really Howard? NYC is not like the suburbs? I wasn't aware...."
"What about just a family gathering?In Oz we have still have under 100 people indoors together...well, I haven't checked the news yet this morning, so who knows right now. My nephew had to cancel his engagement party for this weekend. Terrible times, but it's a memory he can tell his grandkids about. (Update, just checked our news and it's being considered to be one person per 4 square metres for indoor gatherings like at restaurants and cafes). Still Ok in your own home."
"Risa, I am trying not to drink, It's Lent!!! But that may go out the window soon. I am not even suppose to go for my walks in the Park.Vancouver's ""better"" restaurants are not like NYC's where the Take Out/Delivery is an integral part of their service. However, many of them are now offering a ""Take Out Window"". I had promised to do that. But ""how"", when one can't go to the Park, can one justify driving to the Take Out Window??No, Aynat.

"WEQ, can't you give up socializing for Lent instead? ;)"
You can give up going to church for Lent as they are all closed.
"""WEQ, can't you give up socializing for Lent instead? ;)"" I would think WEQ has sacrificed soo much else during Lent that God will give a pass on a drink."
"I already gave up All socializing. II only see my husband!!! Am tempted to have a Gin and Tonic (Tonic has quinine). Our Churches are still celebrating mass, depending on the ""discretion"" of each individual pastor, BUT subject to no more than 50 people in attendance. Am going to be going to mass via EWTN, something so totally ""alien"" but strange times go for strange measures.No big dear really. It wasn't as if I was planning something like a wedding. It was just take out food with some members of the family. It's the gym, the massage, and the visit to the hairdresser that were ""aborted"" this week that ""suck!""

"""mostly during ""senior hours"" which are early in the morning (do they have that in NY?)"" the morton williams grocery chain has that not sure about other chains."
"""tonic has quinine""...if only this were malaria!Since one of our leaders seems to think off label use of a malaria drug might offer promise it's a small rationalization to consider a gin and tonic to be medicinal and at worst a venial sin?"
"Didn't hear that about quinine - we're going for straight wine ourselves.But gin and tonic sounds fine, too."
Gin and tonics were popular in colonial places as a way to make medicinal/propholactic doses o quinine palatable https:/…
"Right now the situation is quite dire here. It’s an adventure just going to the store to buy milk. Obviously traveling anywhere is a risk, and with each passing hour this question becomes more and more redicilous. But to clarify again, I’m talking a day trip like Bear Montain. An overnight somewhere is getting riskier by the day."
Are you sure you even want to go to Bear Mountain?
Here is the website of Bear Mountain State Park.Perhaps take a look at the warning at the top of the page in orange.https://parks.ny.gov/parks/13/details.aspx

"Thanks for that Risa. I’ve been actually keeping about 15 feet away, so it’s good to know I can get closer.Aynat, no not a milestone. Just want to leave the house. For a “borough of parks” our parks are not particularly great, hence the question. I think the safest bet is Green-wood tomorrow. Thanks Howard and Kaye. Will check out."
"For a Staten Island hike you might not have done, or heard of before, you can walk from Goodhue Center (in the process of becoming a city park) on trails behind St. Peter's Boys HS, out through Allison Pond Park, across Henderson Ave. into Snug Harbor Park. From there you could loop back, or take neighborhood streets back, going through all the lovely (proposed to be a landmark historic district that never happened) homes in Randall Manor.Another nice neighborhood walk, with good winter views, is Ward Hill. Park your car around Cebra and Ward Aves and walk around looking towards the bay and Verrazzano Bridge. Mud Lane in Stapleton could be included, and also has some views besides the house used in Boardwalk Empire on St. Paul's Ave - if you care to try a ""hike"" in your own backyard."
"I left out Jones Woods Park, with a high point looking out over Tompkinsville toward the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge, to start before crossing Lafayette Avenue to Goodhue Center. Deer and other wildlife are spotted in this area too."
"Here I think the kids are getting tired of being inside in front of the computer or television. I am starting to see more and more of them get their bike out.There is not much to do. Cities are closing parks, even dog parks.The only things for me left to do is work (I am a freelancer) and watch anything I can find with New York in it (God Friended Me is a favorite of mine right).I do try to stay away from looking at the New York webcams as I find they are too depressing."
"If you're feeling the need to get out (and who doesn't), your idea of Bear Mountain is a pretty good one. It's easy to wander there with very little to no interaction with others; it's not busy at this time of year. There is a stretch of the Appalachian Trail that goes from behind the Bear Mountain Inn and climbs to the top of the mountain from which you can see all the way to NYC on a clear day. In the last few years that part of the trail has been refurbished by volunteers cutting and setting about a thousand granite steps into the side of the mountain. It's a bit fairy tale-like, the steps through the woods, over footbridges and up to the top. But it's not precipitous or unsafe. It's not a crowded walk even at peak season, so you should be able to keep a good healthy social distance."
"At least in NJ all of the nature centers, trails, etc remain open. Just all of the facilities are closed. So don't do anything that might lead to a need for rescue, but otherwise plenty of great outdoors. Hopefully that remains the case.The MIll Creek Marsh Trail in secausus looks pretty neat, and given traffic will be lower on I-95 right now it should be especially nice."
"***The MIll Creek Marsh Trail in secausus looks pretty neat,***I haven't been on that trail, but there are trails on the other side of the Hackensack River in the Meadowlands. All of that water is heavily polluted and I would imagine all the waste from the landfill of years ago doesn't help either. I didn't get much of a nature vibe."
What's wrong with Freshkills Park on Staten Island?
"Years ago when you went through NJ on the train towards the Hudson Tunnel, you would see green-yellow chromium all over the ground. This is a toxic industrial byproduct that was spread about to kill rats supposedly. This has all been visibly cleaned up for some years now, though I suspect the ground still has this."
"I know I don't live there, but assuming (yes, I know) that spring is spring, I would go to wherever there is an abundance of cherry trees. To be under their canopy of blossoms is beyond wonderful.I have no idea there that might be in relation to Staten Island, but that's what I'd seek out."

For years, companies were dumping all kinds of waste into the creek.

When the dump was active, we used to ride dirt bikes along the Turnpike. I used to see people catching crabs and thought they were nuts. Even back then, 30 plus years ago, it was known that those waters were loaded with PCB's."
"Aynat62 assuming you're not being snide or sarcastic: Fresh Kills Park hasn't officially opened. There are previews every year, but it's not ready for the public yet. Secondly it's on top of a landfill that was dumped upon with who knows what for decades, both through NYC Dept of Sanitation, and whatever people brought in for a few extra bucks to get someone to look the other way. Neither of my siblings will go there as an experiment, much less for a day outdoors, but they live in Jersey anyway. As an example, most of Great Kills Park has been closed since 9/11 because radioactivity was discovered there - from the dirty landfill used in the past. Common wisdom is to avoid landfill parks, and especially parks built directly on the world's largest landfill.There's a Greenbelt with trails, and deer, and Pouch Camp - a Boy Scout camp with a lake, Lake Orbach, if you wanted a trail through woods.Edited: 9:16 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Linda5jwink, I'm not being snide or sarcastic at all. A few years ago I was driven past that area and saw how the green grass and hills were coming along. I assumed it would be even better now.According to this FAQ some of it is already open and the North Park is due to open this year:https:/…visit"
"Aynat62 the parts that are open aren't anything like a park you would go to for recreation. The ""greenway"" runs along an extremely busy, 8 lanes wide, Richmond Avenue, along the perimeter of what used to be the section of the dump nearest the Staten Island Mall."
"I live in Eltingville, about 5 minute drive to Freshkills Park. I can’t say I’ve been unless driving on Richmond Ave counts. We have lots of parks. Our favorite is Clove Lake but it’s not terribly close. Wolfe’s Pond used to be a fave when the kids were well, kids. Most of the closer parks like Bloomingdale are a little sad, and we are not walking distance to any of them. Thanks Linda for the suggestions. I’ve been to those areas but never actually hiked there. I volunteered one summer to help my oldest create some of the trails on the Greenbelt. I may have missed a mark or three so not sure how safe it is ;)We are staying home looks like, but this thread has been healing in a way. Well, mostly"
Very sad that Cuomo has to use his press conference to literally BEG young people to stop congregating in the parks etc. He is going to the parks himself today. People still don't get it...same everywhere but the scale is much greater in cities like NYC.

"These wealthy people who think they can escape a pandemic in the hamptons or or fire island are deluded. It only takes one person, as Westchester folks have learned. And if I have a medical emergency I’d rather be in nyc where I can walk to an urgent care vs fire island or the hamptons where healthcare options are more limited. Same reason I chose not to go to our family beach home down south. Medical care in that town sucks and I don’t want to get stuck there. No offense to West Virginia but I wouldn’t want to be at the mercy of their hospitals. They’re less overwhelmed now but that could change quickly. Nyc is so deserted right now it’s kind of a fun escape just walking around and enjoying the lack of people for a change."
"Ziggy60 those are some of my daily dog walks. I enjoy the scenery, and she likes the smells. My house is right between Jones Woods Park (my back property line abuts it) and Goodhue Center which is one half block and across Lafayette Avenue away. Silver Lake Park is a nice bike ride, slightly less than a mile away, and Clove Lakes (a bigger and better park) a couple of miles away.Lots of really nice neighborhood walks with interesting architecture and some beautiful gardens in my area:Pendleton Place, Park Place, and Harvard Avenue. Also some famous abolitionists lived in West Brighton, and the home of the Civil War commander who the movie GLORY was about had a home in Livingston, on the other side of Snug Harbor. I actually went on a NYPL history walk around there one time."

"Articles like that really irritate me. I have friends who decamped to their homes out there. They are just staying in their homes, just wanted to be in a place where they could sit outside or have their kids have a place to run around. The restaurants have had pick up service available for a week and have been following the occupancy requirements. A few bad actors doesn’t mean the whole East end of Long Island has gone off the rails."
I have seen many people fleeing the city and I am sure at least some of them are taking the virus with them to their new location. One of the reasons why the entire country should go on lockdown together.
"That’s another story - people who knowingly travel w the virus or who knowingly travel after they are aware of being exposed, should be treated the same way as people w any other communicable disease who take such risks. Reckless endangerment or worse. That should be actionable."
"#80How would that work? For one thing, there are likely more roads that cross states than law enforcement capability to patrol them. What about people who live in one state and work at an essential business in another? (common in the area I live in upstate near the PA border and I assume common down that way with NJ as well). Would they be forbidden to cross state lines? How would that presumed exception not occur - by stopping every car?What is cited in that article appears to all be within NY state and the rules for NYC apply to the rest of the state unless I missed something.People should simply choose not to be irresponsible if they are sick with COVID symptoms no matter where they live.Edited: 6:53 pm, March 21, 2020 "

"The last part that was quoted was the part that was not directed at you, Ziggy, and specifically said so.The existence of this thread created the premise that it was ok to travel. Not whether YOU were actually acting irresponsibly but that raising the issue of where to go gave license to others to do so. That's the problem. The governor is asking people to not hang out in parks in groups, not play sports, to reduce density. Walks to get out are one thing, but people are not paying attention to the need to truly distance ourselves. It sucks. But it must be done"
IIRC in this mornings press conference Cuomo asked BDB & the city park dept to urgently (24 hours) create a plan to address the situation where people are gathering inappropriately and manage the situation.
"""IIRC in this mornings press conference Cuomo asked BDB & the city park dept to urgently (24 hours) create a plan to address the situation where people are gathering inappropriately and manage the situation."" Simple solution., Start issuing massive fines to those who gather in groups like that. Eventually they will get the message."
"""Other than two terrifying stressful trips to the supermarket."" - yea going to the store stressing me the heck out. Many people refuse to social distance. I try to go late at night when possible to limit contact. Everytime I go out though I feel like a scavenger in some post apocalyptic world."
"What bothers me most about people who are Out and About (aside from their ambivalence to the NEED for keep a ""social distance"" ) is the insistence of many to keep smoking as they walk about.,. Not only are they endangering their own immunity but those of the people in the vicinity."
@101 I think the smokers are one of the groups of the people who are having more negative outcome with the virus. You would think that would be sufficient motivation to stop smoking if only temporarily.

"""I doubt if we have the manpower to issue citations widely"" They don't need to issue thousands of citations. They could simply walk through central park and hand out a few dozen and then the message will go out. Putting the word out that there will be consequences will certainly deter some (not all) of those people, but every bit helps. Also with central park it has its own police stations. We have over 38,000 police officers I'm sure a few can be spared for the larger parks."
"Re #100 I don't know about where you live, but where I live, in Manhattan, all the Trader Joes last week adopted reduced hours -- close 3 hrs earlier at night and open one hour later in morning (now 9am-7pm).

When I was last there, Thurs midday, was very easy to quickly move around store without coming too close to others and no line for checkout. Shelves also fully stocked, so didn't get that depressing post apocalyptic feeling. Plus got everything on my list. Was huge improvement over what had been previous week.Have to go back in day or two so will be interesting to see if that setup is still working."
"Deploy Parking Meter Enforcers to patrol the Parks to ensure people keep their distance.Suspend handing out Parking Meters. Those parked may be Essential Service Workers: doctors, delivery persons, nurses etc. They should be spared this while doing public service."
The Olympic committee is considering postponing the summer games.
"""They could simply walk through central park and hand out a few dozen and then the message will go out. ""Red, this is exactly what you can NOT do. That is selective enforcement of a law and opens up the city for claims of discrimination. Either you ticket all across the five boroughs with some uniformity or equality, or you don't. You can't just enforce against one group of people selectively."
"""Red, this is exactly what you can NOT do. That is selective enforcement of a law and opens up the city for claims of discrimination. "" Really? Discrimination how? What protected class? The upper east and west side crowd??? A bunch of white people? Give me a break."
"Good luck with that.So bizarre to live in these two alternate universes, the armchair enforcers on the TA NYC forum, and the world of people who have ideas that can actually solve problems.To address the same situation, one of my friends contacted people she knew in the mayor's office and the governor's office, saying that streets should be closed to give people more social distancing opportunities, on Friday. Today, the governor announce that he was encouraging BdB to look into that approach. Somehow, good ideas make their way through."
@112 I don't see you having any brilliant ideas to deal with the situation of crowds gathering in the parks unless of course you want to advocate just closing them to everyone. Pretty easy to bash other people's ideas.
"Closing streets makes no sense to me. How would essential workers get to their jobs? Or nonessential workers (who chose not to hoard) do essential errands? Or just plain rule-abiding folks go for a run or a walk? I’m with Red that enforcing social distancing in problem areas makes sense. I don’t see how that differs from traffic stops, say. (Does this make me an armchair enforcer?)"
"Not bashing. But some things are workable and some aren't. I thought I was being informative, if you choose to take it as bashing, that's your choice. But facts are, it is not workable to ticket like that."
"With so many stores closed, there are far fewer people on the streets, the idea would be to close some of the side streets. Red's idea was just to do it in Central Park. If you do it all over, then it's fine. If you just do it in one place, you are looking for trouble. It's like ""spot zoning""."
"But you know what, go for it. Send your ideas in to the mayor and governor. I'm sure that is far more fruitful than arguing with people on TA. As far as my brilliant ideas, I don't post them here. I send them where they are useful. I was in contact with clients, people in the fashion business and interior design business, for the last 48 hours about retooling for making masks. Guess what! Those businesses are now making masks."
""" I don’t see how that differs from traffic stops, say."" exactly Linda. Nobody says cops have to issue the citations they can have discretion and issue warnings, but the threat of it would be enough to deter at least some of the people from gathering together."
"Do you mean closing the streets to passenger vehicles (perhaps only in Midtown and downtown Manhattan) so pedestrians can walk in the streets? Buses? Cabs?Traffic stops can be based on questionable criteria too. Haven't you ever heard of ""driving while (minority)"" problems?"
"""Red's idea was just to do it in Central Park. If you do it all over, then it's fine. If you just do it in one place, you are looking for trouble. It's like ""spot zoning""."" actually that wasn't my initial suggestion but when someone voiced concern about there not being enough cops. I mentioned Central Park as an example because its the most visited park in NYC."
"Interesting point, Kaye - I know that’s something transit/safe street advocates have suggested, as it would make it much easier for people to maintain a safe distance if they could walk in the roadway.But it doesn’t sound as though that’s what the friend with the direct line to the governor and mayor was talking about. I hope I’m wrong."
Seems like they will start cracking down on people gathering in the parks using the police.https:/…
"There are very few people on the streets around here. The buses that pass are almost entirely empty. I have not been to downtown Flushing, however. The local Chinese takeout is closing for two weeks starting Monday. They used to be busy with the local school staff, but this declined even before the school closed. I see I am not supposed to go out after 8 pm tonight being over 70."
"I'm not claiming ownership of it, it's not my idea, but the concept was to do it in residential neighborhoods so that people have space to walk with 6 feet between them. If you close down some cross town side streets in residential areas, it would give people room. Not every block, because that would create a whole different set of problems. I thought it was bananas when my friend said it in a group chat on Thursday or Friday, but as she's refined it over the weekend and sent it up the chain, it's reached the governor."
"""There are very few people on the streets around here."" How densely packed with people is the area where you are? There are still too many people on the streets where I live, but the problem is there are soo many people who live here that if only a small percentage goes out you have people all over the place. The numbers are down quite a bit though."
"Linda, that's exactly what she was talking about. Walking in the roadway. That's what the purpose of closing streets was all about.Edited: 5:49 pm, March 22, 2020 "
And that friend just sent me this:https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-c…
"Closing the streets, IMHO is not going to help much. Those who are simply oblivious to the idea of social distancing are not going to consciously keep their space. That just causes more clustering.When I went for a walk last night, if someone else on the sidewalk, I moved to a safe side of the street, close to parked cars, making sure to avoid the oncoming traffic. That's easy to do in my ""area"" on an early weekend evening."
"Ah, so I misunderstood the original reference (I thought it was to close streets to pedestrians, not cars). In this case, I think it’s a great idea and am glad it was picked up. I think I saw something about it a few days ago from one of the transit blogs I follow."
This is hilarious. https:/…
"""Closing the streets, IMHO is not going to help much. Those who are simply oblivious to the idea of social distancing are not going to consciously keep their space. ""I disagree. I think it will help for the very thing you said about your area. While I agree people are oblivious, for example the jerks that stand directly in the center of the sidewalk yapping on their phones , I do think opening up the streets (within reason so deliveries are not impacted) will give more space for us to navigate around those who simply don't care about social distancing. I would think the street would be just open to walking and getting exercise etc and not for people to linger on the street all day which would defeat the purpose IMO."
"While they'd need to keep some avenues and major cross town streets open in Manhattan for buses and truck deliveries a lot of the other streets could be closed to traffic Maybe with designated hours for truck deliveries to affected areas. (Maybe designate specific car lanes for bikes too)Downtown Flushing is often very crowded - wonder if the Asian community there is more compliant and aware because of news from their countries of originEdited: 6:00 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Red, I hope so. I just keep seeing people who don't seem to understand the safe distancing issue. As an example: markets have set out markers to emphasize the ""required"" space distance. It is often disregarded by many, usually younger adults. You'd think they'd be aware of the dangers we currently face. Or on a sidewalk: when a pedestrian is approaching, instead of moving furthest to one side of the sidewalk continue to walk in the centre and sometimes towards the oncoming ""traffic"".It's a constant battle and the only alternative would be to stay home."
"I have not taken the 15 min. walk to the center of Flushing, but things are very quiet here. Mask wearing is very common as it was prior to this, but is now general. The masks I bought the other day for $2 survive only one day it seems. Today, it kept slipping down. This was not a medical quality mask."
"That's how quickly things changed.Ziggy posted his innocent question on March 18th. It made sense and everybody was civil. It was only a few days later that things got drastic and restrictions got worse.People do like looking for fights or just don't know when to back off. Same with that big coronavirus thread. It started a few weeks ago and people weren't taking things seriously then, but it's deadly serious now. Funny how some people have changed their tune."

"Well, I came out of self-isolation to go to Manhattan at 10:45 tonight to get medication urgently needed. (From Sunnyside, Queens.) No 24-hour pharmacies open in my neck of the woods. Called five different car services. Dial 7 wouldn't take me from there; the other four didn't even bother to answer the phone. This is unheard of. It's just not New York any more.Walked to the Blvd. (Queens Blvd.) for the bus. One person on Queens Blvd., a homeless guy who wanted to chat. Asked all kinds of nosey questions. I finally had to give him the boot. I felt bad but it's like a creepy movie. But I felt safe, strangely.From here in Sunnyside you have a clear view of the Empire State Building. It's all lit up in red. And it's beating red, like a heart. I almost cried. Now that's (italics) New York. That's why I live here.Waited 20 minutes for a bus. Trip took 10 minutes. Then a 10 minute walk.The pharmacist was divine. All alone, over night. In the emptiest city in the world. Said he would offer me a ride except he doesn't get off until 8 a.m. We laughed. I told him I might have to come back and take him up on it. Now he is a hero.And the cab driver from, I think, Haiti who stopped for me on 3rd Ave. and took me home to Queens, he is a hero. Manhattan is still open, people. Whispering, but still open.We are strong and we are going to get through this. And what a comeback we're going to have!"
"What a beautiful post, Lizzie! New York will be back and better than ever. This is for sure. When I looked at the red and white image of Empire Street Building on TV, I must admit I burst into tears... New Yorkers have always been my heroes and they are even more now. Stay safe!Nora"
"You just majorly tugged on my heart strings LizzieandIzzy. So loved what you wrote!From the other end of the world to you (and all of you), sending you even more strength and you bet, we are gonna get through it.:-)"
"Is it wise for New Yorkers to be traveling out of state? I know of people who have a place in upstate New York and also in Florida. Right now they are in Florida and thanks to the NY license plates on their car they are attracting much unwelcome and rude attention, and it is getting worse."
I noticed today that several bus companies such as Megabus have suspended service in NY and PA. We tend to hear more about commuter trains and subways.
Fox -This happened in my area (3.5 hours upstate from NYC and 10 miles from PA border) on 3/26. County decision.
