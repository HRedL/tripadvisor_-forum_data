"I'm absolutely fine with this approach and agree it's for the best. However, our understanding from what we've read in the media was that it was to be enforced from tomorrow morning, hence going for some exercise today. On return to our hotel, they have now also enforced the new rules with immediate effect.We will of course be following the rules. Hopefully our Tour Operator can get us home soon, as the less number of people are here the more chance there is of containing this. We feel sad that the local businesses of this lovely place will suffer financial losses, but once this is all over we'll be back to beautiful Nerja. Take care everyone"
Hope you get home safely Ruth You ll hopefully come back to lovely Nerja when all this is sorted
