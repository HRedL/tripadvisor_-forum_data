Do you think more cases will show up when testing starts later this week
Of course
Yup.
"Hmmmm, I might be wrong but I think I might have read a post or 2 warning that this was going to happen.....Edited: 4:37 pm, March 11, 2020 "
Are you daft?Many many more. It's a mathematical certainty.Sheesh.
How many new case of the flu?
"There are no treatments on hand for COVID-19 as there are for the seasonal flu,"
"""Three new cases in vegas today!""I'm surprised it's not more. Many people like to buy new luggage for a holiday."
"And some people consciously choose not to get a flu shot, for whatever reason. That's not the case now.And yes, I'm aware that a flu shot is not 100% effective against all flu strains."
Your right DTC. How many flu deaths this flu season?
There’s no correlation. This isn’t “ the flu “.
"I'm saying there are medical options for fighting the flu. But some choose not to use them.Not the case for this virus, which is not the flu.Edited: 5:43 pm, March 11, 2020 "
It is not the flu. That's true. The flu is much worse (by the numbers) and yet no buffets shut down.
Willful ignorance gives me heartburn.
"You guys just don't get it... i am truly amazed how slow people are, yikes"
Nexium might help with that.
"Exercising and eating right are better than any flu shot you can get. I haven't had a flu shot or the flu for at least 20 years, and I am old. Maybe I've pushed my luck too far and coronavirus will put me face down in the cornflakes."
This. Is. Not. A. Flu. Strain.It is different in an unknown way.SMH.
"Yeah, no $h1t! It was manufactured in a lab in Wuhan China."
"According to Dr. Fauci, director of the NIAID, it's 10 times more lethal than flu. That said, good infection control will help slow the spread and the flu is only lethal in about 0.1% of cases.https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-be…"
"Shacky....based on your original comment, it is amazing that you would call anyone slow."
"Underpar,I am sorry if I implied that this was a flu strain. The point I was trying to make (poorly) was that the flu is just as contagious (29 million estimate) this season and deadly (16 to 18 thousand) this flu season. Source CDC.We aren't reporting how many people checked into the Mirage with the flu, we aren't closing restaurants because of the flu, we didn't have a run on TP because of the flu.We (Americans) are used to the flu and the 20 to 60 thousand deaths that it causes each year. Most of us have had the flu at some point in our lives. What is going on with this virus is that we (Americans) don't know what this is so we are over-reacting. If you don't believe it look at the first page of the Las Vegas forum."
">>> ·According to Dr. Fauci, director of the NIAID, it's 10 times more lethal than flu.<<<I'm not challenging wether or not he said it, I just don't know how he could make such a statement when they have no idea how many people have the virus. If ten times more people have the virus and aren't symptomatic then then number is way off.Also 10 times more lethal than the flu would mean that it's lethal to 1% of the people that contract the virus. It has been widely reported that the rate is 3%. There are not accurate numbers on this."
"Jupiter, how so?"
"Shacky, there are over a hundred cases in Canada. Do you think there will be more?"
"""Exercising and eating right are better than any flu shot you can get.""Citation?""I haven't had a flu shot or the flu for at least 20 years, and I am old.""Anecdotal evidence is evidence of nothing."
"Ok, got it..."
"Again Bob, the flu has 500% exposure per year. (It cycles through on average 5 times a year.) COVID-19's exposure is 1%-3% right now. And there's no vaccine. And it's far more transmissible.So again, comparing hard numbers of the flu to COVID-19 is willfully ignorant."
It might be if you had hard numbers.
"Upstate, your just not going to convince anyone who puts their fingers in their ears and their hands over their eyes. All you can do at this point is ask what I've asked: Bob, please give us your number for when this won't just be media's fault or mass hysteria? You just won't believe PnS's on another thread."
Get your flu shot now anyway.The flu would make you very vulnerable to this new infection.
I read the PnS followup on the other thread and I agree with that statement as well.
"""... anyone who puts their fingers in their ears and their hands over their eyes.""It took me a few goes to figure out how to do this, but I can confim that it is possible.Just make sure you wash your hands first though, as it involves face touching."

"Things to consider.Once the health agencies have tested enough people to get a denominator with which to compare the # of deaths, then we'll have an excellent mortality %.Of the deaths, then how many were in whatever particular segment or group for that %.And:""We’ve cancelled all travel for the next 4 months"" is hopefully overly protective.

"""I have no idea what this means.""It means that the CDC regularly gets the flu vaccine wrong for a particular years strain, so the shot does no good.

So get off the couch and start working out. Will the virus kill the 60 year old 5 ft 8 350 pound man or the 60 year old 5 ft 8 150 pound man first?"

"@FLWYou are putting words into my mouth. I never said that and you know it. What I basically said was that until we start to see a large number of young and or basically healthy people contract the virus and then die from it, this isn't something that most people on here need to fear.The elderly and those with compromised immune systems are indeed at a higher risk for catching this. They also have a higher chance of death from it. I agree, they should take precautions. So should everyone else so as to not potentially transmit any illness, Coronavirus, flu, colds, etc. That doesn't mean suspend the NBA season, quit going out to eat, and live like a hermit surrounded by mass quantities of toilet paper. You and a few others seem to imply it is only a few idiots saying this is no big deal. There are many doctors who agree with me. There are many others who don't. People can be wrong. If I am, I'll admit it. Right now, people are perceiving things to be worse than they actually are in this country. This is the case politically and economically. Many see the stock market drop and are afraid, I'll see it as this is great, some good stocks are 20% off. Time to see what I want to buy. Finally, the death rate from flu is approx 0.1%. Considering most people that get COVID19 don't even know about it, we haven't really been testing people at a large scale, the death rate seems to be much lower than 3.4%. I've heard 0.9% which is statistically insignificant when compared to the flu.Edited: 9:59 am, March 12, 2020 "
"I hate to chime in here because people are so entrenched in their positions. But the point is that there are many things we simply don't know about this virus because it is new. We don't know the real death rate and what it would be in the U.S. compared to other countries. But we do know that it is fairly contagious, apparently more so than the flu. It reproduces slower than the flu but faster than SARS. Because so many people are asymptomatic, they unknowingly spread it. All of these things make it a good candidate to control through social distancing.Two good pieces on what we know about the virus:https:/…https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/corona…To say that other diseases like swine flu or SARS had a lot of hype but didn't wipe us out is missing the point. The impact of these viruses was mitigated because governments and public health systems took action to curb them. The hysteria results in action and avoids the worst outcomes.The real threat for the U.S. is not just how many people die or what any particular individual's risk is - it is OVERWHELMING HOSPITALS. I too was very skeptical of what I thought was an overreaction to the virus until a colleague with family in Italy persuaded me otherwise. The problem for Italy is that infections spiked very quickly and absolutely overwhelmed their health care system. Despite what you may think, northern Italy actually has a high quality health care infrastructure. But people are in beds up and down the hallways and they are forced to prioritize ventilators for the younger, healthier patients most likely to survive. The U.S. has decent hospital capacity overall, but less than many European countries and is very weak in some parts of the country. There are only so many ventilators and we may be forced into the same tough situation as the Italians are. Please, if you look at nothing else, look at this article on the effect of social distancing (scroll down to graphic comparing St. Louis and Philadelphia with the Spanish flu). The whole goal is to flatten the curve of transmission so that the hospitals are not overwhelmed with thousands of patients at once. It uses the metaphor that if your whole family is going to get the flu, it is better to get it one at a time rather than all at once, so that there is someone well enough to take care of the sick person.https:/…Flu kills a lot of people, but precisely because the flu has been sending a lot of people to the hospital, we are even more at risk because the hospitals will still be dealing with flu patients as coronavirus patients start to stream in. This also means that if you need to go to a hospital for another reason - a car wreck for example - you want the emergency room to be able to process you and you want to be able to get a bed in an ICU unit if you need it. If the hospitals are overwhelmed with corona virus patients, you may not be able to and your risk of an adverse outcome goes up, even though you didn't get the virus.Public health experts aren't out to get us, they are trying to do their jobs. Hopefully this virus will be seasonal like the flu and start to die out in our part of the world as spring settles in, but we simply don't know whether that is true yet and there is conflicting evidence. When you are dealing with an unknown, caution is generally advised."
"PNS,Estimates right now are between 70 million to 150 million people contracting Covid19 (Dr Brian Monahan, attending physician of Congress and the Supreme Court on Tues). Using 1% that means a minimum 700,000 people will die if his lowest number is correct Below is a quote from the CDC website"" While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.""Even if 70 million becomes 50 million it is still substantially larger numbers than the flu Now think about how hospitals are going to handle the influx of patients That is a major factor for the death rate from country to country right now Do hospitals have capacity for the influx of critically ill patients?People in your demographic are not affected personally but will impact others. All that is being done is to try to slow down the rate of infection. Why would we not at least try? I think there will be some major inconveniences but no one is suggesting you live like a hermit"
"""You are putting words into my mouth. I never said that and you know it.""You exactly said you would not consider this serious (or not the result of mass hysteria or media hype) unless it affected (paraphrasing since I don't want to look it up, but you know it's what you said) ""thousands of young healthy people per state.""So what does that mean? First there would have to be a minimum of 100,000 of this group affected (""thousands"" equals at least 2,000 per state X 50 states.) You did not mention any other group (people in their sixties or older.) Therefore by your metric you will not take this seriously even if millions of that particular group were to die. No I don't think that's going to happen but it a direct consequence of your thoughtless, and frankly ageist, post.You have no defense, you said it."
"Really FLW, you had to bump this. It was almost off the first page."
"So I did look it up. Your exact quote, ""When thousands of young, healthy people are dying in a month in each state, then call it a pandemic.""You gave us the terms for when you think it's a pandemic. By simple logic it means that no other scenario will fit your definition of a pandemic. So yeah according to you if millions of people over 60 die you won't call it a pandemic."

"@FLW You act like I don't care about older people. That is far from the truth. However, let's be real here, the over 60 crowd tends to have more health problems and tends to die from things that wouldn't kill a 20 year old. Of course a nursing home that gets one infected patient is going to spread it. Just like norovirus spreads on a cruise ship. Contained environments are breeding grounds for illness. Why do you have to fight with basically everyone? What have I ever done to you in anyway. You are getting far too emotional over this. People have different perspectives. Yours are valid to you, mine are to me. Everyone has a right to an opinion. If I'm ever elected to public office and you disagree with me, then you can moan because my actions impact you. As of right now, I'm not doing anything that harms you."
"True but I didn't bump this back to the top of the page, it seems everyone but you was happy to let this thing go."
"""@FLWYou act like I don't care about older people""I quoted EXACTLY what you said and took it to its obvious conclusion. I responded only because I was frankly shocked by what you said."
"For the record, I care about the elderly. Actually I like them a heck of a lot more than millennials (my generation) or Gen Z."
