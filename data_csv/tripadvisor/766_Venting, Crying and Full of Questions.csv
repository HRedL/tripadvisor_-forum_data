"So yes ,I am pouting here over this whole travel ban US/Europe. Truth is we were spending 2 days in Paris as of the 20th and then traveling to Luxembourg to be with my sister and her husband who live there. Our latest plan was to possibly arrive in Paris and go straight to Lux if needed but now we cant go at all. I can't even begin to explain the level of upset, as I am sure many are feeling the same way. To me this trip was more about spending time with my sister more than anything else. Ugh. Okay venting over.Now to my questions...- Hotels were pre-paid. Have any of you encountered any hotels that are being flexible on refunding due to the extreme situation?- Eiffel tower - Any chance that they would also refund because of this unforeseen event?- I read somewhere in one of these posts that SNCF is refunding cancelations? I guess I will try that.- Flight was through Norwegian I hear they have been terrible about flexibility for those that had travels to Italy so not expecting much from there.In any case, sorry for the vent and hopefully I can get some guidance on these questions."
"We're in the same boat. We're set depart on Saturday, a few hours after the ban"
We were set to depart on March 18th. I just emailed Eurostar and Priceline (Paid for Hotel in advance) to see if they are willing to work with us. I also contacted our credit card company which we used to purchase both and they will do what they can to try to help us....
"This is all so disheartening. I think I am more bothered about the fact that the ban is not going to do much. The virus is already here and surely more than what we know considering the lack of testing. No bans on other countries with high number of cases, so then what?I just wrote the two hotels I had booked hoping that they will offer some sort of flexibility. Didn't think about calling the credit card company - good point will try that as well.Wishing everyone on this same boat the best."
"Watching news after Trump speech and web and so far:- DHS says ban of travel from Europe only applies to Schengen nationals. https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…- Trump himself tweeted that,, no, the ban doesn’t apply to goods so won’t hurt the economy , “just people. “ https:/…Frustrating that at a time that begs for clarity we get anything but.Edited: 10:27 pm, March 11, 2020 "
An unusually ridiculous measure. We can't test in America. We can't provide protective gear to health care workers. We are censoring information and preventing scientists and experts from doing their work. But we can do a showy air flight ban.Meanwhile it spread in the US without tests or information dissemination --
">> But we can do a showy air flight ban. <<On them foreigners. Absurd.Edited: 10:38 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"@Janettravels44 Exactly, right? So senseless. I am very understanding and sensitive to the current situation but this just doesn't make sense. @Hamlet So confused right now. So technically we as US citizens can go in and out? I read the link but still confused. I guess as you said ""where is the clarity?"""
If you can bear the twitter platform (and ignore the usual arguing in the replies) this is about as good an explanation as I’ve seen so far.https:/…
"I’m completely confused too! Everything seems so vague right now. Like a lot of people I tried to get more clarification by searching the internet but now I have more questions... LOL! I’m supposed to fly to Paris on 1 April, with a layover in London. I guess I will wait and see what American Airlines emails me."
Indeed all flights aren't suspended and US citizens and the like are not prevented from traveling to/from Europe. That was a terrible misunderstanding
You can still go on your flight. Only EU nationals are banned from coming INTO the country. It' s not a ban to go into France or LUX.
"OP, you can still fly to Europe (and return to the U.S. if you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident). If you decide to cancel, however, I can respond to the SNCF cancellation policy. We decided to cancel our trip to France the day before departure (March 10) and received a full refund for our non refundable tickets."
Thank you Rumples. I think I moved too fast. I went ahead and canceled my train tickets and saw that I would get a refund and now I’m reading that I can still go on my trip. Oh goodness what to do.
"Stay home!!! Best estimated from the IS expert to senate staff is that this virus is set to kill to kill 700,000 to 1 million Americans. The more people out and about, the more quickly it spreads. Save a life. Please stay home."
If you have any luck with norwegian keep us updated! Im planing on waiting a few days to see if they change there policies or cancel more flights before calling. Was scheduled yo fly out on 3/20 don’t want to have to quarantine upon return.
Ban is not just EU nationals. Anyone coming through the EU in who is not a US citizen - that includes people who are citizens of the rest of the world! Also anyone who has been in the Shengen zone in the last 14 days even if now flying from the UK.
"So it’s ok for Americans to fly here who could possibly as mentioned earlier be either carriers or unbeknown to them already have the virus, bit not for EU nationals, or a lot of other nationalities to go to the US. Truly I don’t understand"
"Jonn – it is also ok for UK citizens to go to the US, because, you know, they've been able to stop the spread with Brexit. You are right. It is ridiculous. I am hoping, but doubting Macron will respond in kind. We should ALL be keeping our Germans at home.ps Hear your people are being very kind to Mr Tom Hanks and his wife in your hospitals. Sorry for the two beds they're taking away from your citizens."

"phread the hospital will be private and elite and since they are not seriously ill all we ever ok. I’m not even sure how many Australians are seriously ill, as Australia doesn’t have anything like the great French government websites that disclose everything to do with this pandemic."
"I did laugh at that too. Going by everything you have ever written, prejudice has never reared it’s ugly head. I have to apologise as Tom and his wife are being treated in a public clinic. I guess those near him will be asking for autographs."
"You can still travel, the ban is only for foreign national entering the US. Just be prepared to get quarantined when you arrive .. the thing that should concern you are the flights you have going from lux, it may be canceled due to either not enough passengers or if countries by then. Impose a ban."
"I'm wondering about US people coming from other places with a layover for a few hours in CDG. I am supposed to be going to Morocco in April and our return date is after the 30 days. We have a 3 hour layover in CDG. Do you think all this applies to that too, or just people that are traveling in EUROPE. When they ask where I have been I will say Morocco."
My concern would be what the situation will be in a few days/week upon your return... will the US make citizens coming back go into self quarantine? That would be my only concern...
"Per post #3: >This is all so disheartening. I think I am more bothered about the fact that the ban is not going to do much.<Actually, any/all international travel potentially exposes travelers to COVID-19 exponentially. Also, once exposed, the virus can be passed to others quickly & easily before symptoms occur. Thus, it wouldn't just be 1-2 people exposed to COVID-19, it could be many people exposed.The travel ban, in fact, reduces the number of people exposed and contracting this virus.Edited: 9:45 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Norwegian Airlines are now cancelling a number of flights to/from the US.
LauraM - these measures have been put in place to save lives. Why are you travelling at all? I know it is a bummer. I have had to cancel several trips. But they’re asking people to self distance for a reason.
"Rentalcars.com, coronavirus, covid-19, rental cancellation procedure: I thought I would share a procedure I just learned today at my own expense for those of you who have to cancel your travel plans. If you need to cancel your car rental reservation with rentalcars.com due to coronavirus/covid-19, CALL customer service BEFORE you cancel and ask them to dismiss the cancellation fee. If you just cancel via the app, for example, they will aply cancellation fees regardless of the circumstances... Once you cancel, they cannot do anything to your reservation. Your only option is to wait for the days of restitution of your cancelled reservation and submit a claim, which may or may not be taken into account. Please pass this information around to whomever needs it. Good luck to you all stuck in the midst of your travels."
I had a reservation through Europcar and just cancelled it with one click since Europcar had announced that there would be no cancellation fees. I was refunded immediately for my prepayment. I would assume that all of the main rental companies are the same and cannot imagine the root of the scam suggested above.
I don't read into it any suggestion of a scam. Sounds like a very clear case of a company who's computer programming is lagging behind their policy.
I saw it as such because the first line looks like a tag line for search engines.
yeah I thought that was weird but didn't know what to make of it. I get your point.
