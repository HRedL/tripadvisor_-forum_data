Not a really surprising development. The shelter in place for the whole state don't even have an end date.
"Good. That's much more realistic than ""normal by Easter""."
"The school closure had already been extended to May 1, so it is not surprising that the stay at home order is extended to then.The state stay at home is until further notice. That is the right answer. The order end date is driven by the virus not by the calendar. And remember that Australia is dealing with this problem, which suggests seasonality might not part of the spread pattern for SARS CoV2....the name of the virus....in spreading Covid-19 the disease."
"Also, infectious disease MDs have repeatedly indicated that the best way to manage SIP and viral estimations is by using the 'wait & see' approach. No one knows how well California or the U.S. will fare.If we review the SARS & Ebola outbreaks, the Spanish Flu & Swine Flu pandemics, all of us in the U.S. can expect that we have a ways to go before returning to the office, eating at restaurants with friends/family, meeting friends for a cocktail, or greeting friends with a hug & kiss."
"I hope that when we are allowed to start venturing out, that there's a cautious plan for allowing businesses to reopen and people to go back to work in steps. Something like small retail stores first, with limits on the number of people at one time; restaurants only if they take out half their tables, etc. Rather than just a free-for-all ""everything's normal"" approach, since we want to avoid a sudden upsurge in new infections."
"@SFSusanI just was having that conversation this weekend with my wife, basically the same as what youve said, I also think bars may have to eliminate ordering at the bar so people aren't gathering around the bar, maybe keep seats spaced apart but no coming up and ordering over the top of someones head like is common now.I wonder if businesses like barber shops, beauty salons, etc will be back sooner than some other things?"
"While I appreciate what is said in #4 and #5, the pressure will be on for small establishments to get revenue. Rents might be deferred but not canceled."
So far so good for San Francisco. I've been tracking things - and although our confirmed infected count keeps going up - I believe that may be due to more testing; our death count remains relatively low at six total. And while no death is good news - it could be much worse (as the east coast is showing us).
"The governor of Maryland just issued a stay at home order, also, not sure it had an end date, which is kind of silly anyway since they just change it if necessary. Now Virginia is more loosey goosey in many ways, and they don't have that type of order, but on their closures list, they do exempt small businesses that are NOT food/bars or personal services, as long as they don't have more than 10 people in the store typically at once. Of course it only takes a couple people to transmit, not 10, but that kind of exemption makes more sense than some. I can't imaghine why barber shops and beauty salons would get exempted first, they are personal, close services, if anything should be last.Now you might ask, well what kind of business is small but not bar/resto or personal services. Not a lot, but where I live some smoke shops thus can stay open (they sell vaping stuff, tobacco, pipe stuff), or smaller dollar type stores, stuff like that. Many small pharmacies like CVS would be also but they are already exempted due to the pharmacy thing. We have some smaller clothing, rug, furniture type stores, art shops, etc., that could easily fit into that exemption also."
"The Bay Area sheltered sooner than any other state or locality. California was the first state to shelter. Ultimately that will help us. New York is under huge pressure, with 10x the number of cases as CA. OK so they’re doing more testing. BUT their deaths are 10x the number of CA as well. Cuomo’s press conferences are excellent and available on YouTube. It’s horribly sad that governors around this country, whether it be N.Y., CA, LA, IL, MI (plus all the others AND Indian nations) have to continue to reinvent a wheel that the feds should be turning. However when we finally win this battle it will be to the state governors that we will owe huge thanks. And most especially to Gov. Cuomo."
"I almost am writng this as a question, because Im not sure that I understand this completely.I was reading something the other day that was saying that it expected CA's peak to hit on April 24th. If I understood what I was reading they were saying that this is a good thing, meaning we have been able to delay the peak and get there slower than other areas not putting such a huge burden on the health system all at once, (I interpreted it as a gradual grade vs a steep hill?). Id also think that CA should far enough into this that the recovered # of patients starts drastically increasing each day too?"
I can't see the shelter-in-place in its current form continuing beyond April. Too many people and businesses aren't going to be able to hold out. I expect that we will see some businesses reopening under certain conditions on or before May 1.
"Do you have a link? Because an April 24 peak sounds very early. And flattening the curve means a longer yet lessened “hill” as opposed to a sharp apex. Gov. Cuomo gives a briefing every day. They’re on YouTube. I wish our governor was doing the same. But NY is in dire straits. They have 10 TIMES the number of cases as CA. Okay, you say, they’re doing more testing. But they also have 10 TIMES the number of fatalities as CADid we do something right by closing down about a week before N.Y.? Who knows. NYC density creates a huge issue. As NY recovers other states will see cases that will likely overrun their health care system. LA and MI being the next up. How can governors who have not sheltered their citizens look themselves in the mirror is beyond me. Especially any state on the eastern seaboard.Oh, and while MN put a shelter order in place, child care workers are deemed essential. Oh yeah, good luck with that."
"Simba, to do so with ANY level of safety would require a level of testing SO FAR beyond what this country has been able to do to date. There is nothing to indicate that we will have testing to that degree 30 days from now. The economy cannot be opened up without a modicum of assurance that we won’t fall into the same cesspool all over again.Edited: 7:00 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"Maddie, I think by the end of April, people are going to be at the point where they're willing to risk increased deaths so they can get back to work to put food on the table and pay the mortgage. As much as I dislike Trump, with the way he's been talking he seems to sense that, too.Edited: 7:06 pm, March 30, 2020 "
Here is what I read from NBC Bay Area.https:/…
"What flattening the curve means is slowing the rate of increase of numbers of infected and infected needing treatment such that the numbers do not overwhelm what is a limited number of beds and icu beds that cannot expand quickly. The curve still assumes the same number of people will be infected, be treated, and die or recover. Flattening helps ensure medical facilities are not going to be overwhelmed, and with medical facilities not overwhelmed, then chances of successful treatment and recovery is enhanced.See my ""favorite"" graph website, and use the log scale and you can clearly see countries that have flattened the curve...Korea for example because I would not trust China stats....and those that didn't like Italy. The numbers in the U.S. are also going to be off because the paucity of testing might be distorting the number. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Stay at home."
"Well I am not willing to put people’s lives ahead of the almighty dollar. Or to say it’s “OK” if an older person dies because, gee, they were going to die anyway. That is not what we are about as Americans or as human beings. The federal government can print money. We have bailed out big corporations before. NOW it is time to stand up for each and every one of us. AND. Until testing can identify those of use who ARE safe to be out and about, it is not safe for anyone to be. The federal government has been completely incompetent. But without more testing we don’t know what’s out there. To allow the economy to open up without that info is unconscionable. And hopefully states will see it that way and not release shelter orders.Yes, there is damage to the economy and there will be more. Would you rather that or lose a mother, aunt, father, sibling? Or, perhaps more sadly, a daughter or nephew?"
"GoodBearThe last paragraph in that article is critical. And not sure how well guidelines have been followed as we’ve discussed here about the lack of distancing in various places. “Unlike some previous models, which estimate millions of deaths across the United States, the University of Washington study takes into account the effects of social distancing, business closures, and shelter-in place orders. The data, according to researchers, also assumes government guidelines will be followed by all states across the country.”"
"To add to what I said in #16, a flattened curve just means that we have not overwhelmed the medical system and its personnel. We are still going to have lots of infected and sick people. And deaths too. Not even ""total"" success places like Taiwan have zero new deaths.And we dont have a centralized command center either. So this is going to be around for a while, and it will remain dangerous, just not at the same rate.I have direct experience in Guangzhou with SARS, but in the end there were ""just"" 1,000 people dead globally. This is far, far scarier."
"The Federal government will be funding the unemployed with the extra $600/week for quite a while. There is no reason for unemployed workers in non-essential vocations to work in contact jobs in May. Even Trump, who is always at least a month behind, changed his tune yesterday from pack the churches on Easter to everybody stay home until at least April 30."
"If lives meant that much to Americans, then we'd have nationalized health care and ban cars and airplanes from operating so nobody died in crashes. The brutal reality is there's always a balancing act between lives and the economy."
“Ban cars and airplanes”Now you have joined the flat earth society. So it is quite OK for someone you care about to die to keep the Dow up? The economy will recover. Should its health be a larger priority than the populous? I vote no. Human life takes priority. Saving lives in this epidemic takes priority. And we see the dedication to that priority every day on the faces of the medical professionals on the front lines.
"I agree that if lives mean that much all Americans would have health insurance. I have over three decades as an expatriate overwhelmingly in Asia with lots of tourism and business trips to Europe, and it is pitiable that we don’t have a health system for everybody ....national or mixed...while every other advanced country does. A key factor in the Korea response, for example.Makes a lot of sense, morally, socially, and economically to have a robust health safety net for all.Would save us a lot of grief imho."
"""Flattening the curve"" isn't a slogan or a qualitative way of addressing the number of infected people, it's a PRECISE measurement. The 'curve' is the 'line graph' that is in the lower right corner of the Johns Hopkins webpage that we're all following (although I'm guessing that most are focused on the colorful map, not the plain-looking line graph that is next to it).This graph is simply measuring the number of cases (total) along the vertical line and is plotting this info against the date that is on the horizontal axis.As long as the number of cases are increasing, this line will be vertical (or, at least, 'above the horizontal'). Up to now, it is almost vertical. When we reach a point where there are NO NEW CASES, the curve will be horizontal, indicating the number of cases is FIXED (not increasing). Remember, this is the TOTAL number of cases (active + recovered + deaths).Once we reach this point, we will still have to wait while those that are still active recover (or die).The cool thing about the Johns Hopkins web page is that the line graph changes whenever you select a specific city or country on the map. Thus far, the only place where the 'curve is flat' (or close to flat) is China and that is supported by the numbers, viz., when one adds the deaths to the recoveries and subtracts that from the 'total cases' the remainder are the 'active cases' which represents only 3% of China's total cases. Said another way, 97% of Chinese who have gotten this illness know their fate! Compare that to the U.S. where 95% of the current number of patients are still 'experiencing the virus'.We've got a long way to go."
"""So it is quite OK for someone you care about to die to keep the Dow up?""It's not about letting people die so the Dow goes up or so people can buy a yacht. It's about recognizing that people need to make a living to survive. I don't expect anyone to sacrifice their lives to improve the economy, but people play the odds when it comes to their lives all the time to earn a buck. Working a fishing boat in the Aleutians is dangerous, but people do it.And my belonging to the Flat Earth Society is irrelevant.Edited: 10:38 pm, March 30, 2020 "

Let’s get back to living. Let’s be smart about it,"" Patrick said on Fox News. ""And those of us who are 70 plus, we’ll take care of ourselves. But don’t sacrifice the country."""
"Chogs, I agree we have a long way to go. But I’m not sure I’m believing the numbers coming out of China right now. People should not have to play Russian roulette with their lives to make a living. As I said before, the fed can print money and has done so to bail out banks and auto makers. Perhaps that courtesy could be extended to regular Joes and small businesses. This economic downturn will be no where as long as 2008. And yet we did very little for the average worker 12 years ago. Mentioning banning cars and airplane reduces your credibility."
"Chogs, look at the graph for Korea. Much more reliable data than China."
"A note to Madeline M #12 - Gavin Newsom is doing live broadcasts each day on Twitter and Facebook live. The high points make it in sound bite form to the evening news, but many of the broadcasts are full of information not found elsewhere."
"""Mentioning banning cars and airplane reduces your credibility.""Why? If people's lives always come first, shouldn't we go to extreme measures like banning cars and airplanes? They do cause deaths. There will be a time when we start opening the economy again. If we wait until we're sure no deaths will be caused as a result, we'll be waiting for years.Edited: 3:00 am, March 31, 2020 "
I think we should ban straw man discussions.
"Where is the ""like"" button?"
"Back to analysis. Some hopeful view of how the San Francisco Bay Area counties are doing. https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-be…But even if our region might be making some headway, we also exist in the context of our state and nation, not to mention that we might be the most globalist part of the country."
I just got a phone call from SF saying this Stay At Home order has been extended until May 3.
"BTW to get a message on this, message Covid19 to 888777."
"This is today’s statement from the Berkeley health department, which is essentially the same as what the other Bay Area health directors are saying. It extends the stay-put for another month and adds some new details about how essential businesses should operate. https://www.cityofberkeley.info/City_Manager…Anyone else like this new addition? “Placing per-person limits on goods that are selling out quickly to reduce crowds and lines.” (And also to ensure that fewer people are at risk of running out of needed items, duh, because there was always plenty of TP, bath soap, and canned beans to go around back in December, & still would be if the worst hogs were not allowed to take control of the trough).BTW, the potus has now warned of a “very painful two weeks” and the prospect of 200,000 Americans dying, so folks, this is real, it isn’t going away, it is not just a matter of waiting for warm weather to come and chase away the cooties. The word has come down from Washington: it is officially, really real.Meanwhile, there was a substantial earthquake north of Boise ID, so I’m about to check with folks whose kid is in college nearby and is staying there and doing remote learning. And there were tornadoes in Iowa, Illinois, and Arkansas over the last couple days. We can't fight Mother Nature."
My kingdom for toilet paper and bleach. I haven't seen either in two weeks.
"I went to Safeway last week and they had laundry detergent. It wasn't exactly my first choice, but I decided I'd better take it. TP and most household cleaning products and bath soap were gone, along with most canned goods, especially soup. This was during morning ""senior hours,"" so it wasn't that they had run out for the day; they had probably run out entirely and their warehouse was bare.Eyewitness report: ""I was waiting in a long line at the supermarket at 6:45 for senior hours that started at 7:00. A young man came from the parking lot and cut past all the seniors to the head of the line, but an old lady beat him back to the parking lot with her cane. He returned and tried to get in front again, but an old man punched him in the stomach and pushed him out of the line. As he approached the line for the third time, he said, ""If you don't let me unlock the door, you''ll never get in there."""
"San Francisco from above, with everything shut down.https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/S…"
I think by the end of things probably will be until Mid May or even June 1st.
"""My kingdom for toilet paper and bleach""Good one Simba"
"jordansbulls, I would be interested in the bases for your prediction."
"Cuomo’s presser today. The NY state model, done by McKinsey, has their apex around April 30. That’s the top of the hill, certainly not the bottom. That curve is way ahead of most states. Nor do I think most states have done the analysis and modeling to even have a clue where their curve is."
"You might take a look at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. https://covid19.healthdata.org/projectionsThat site looks at how long it is until an apex is reached related to medical resources available. Obviously, data accuracy is important.In that site, California by delaying its apex will probably have sufficient resources. New York is likely to be, and may in fact already be overwhelmed.This is not a competition, however. I think California is doing okay. Not as well as Korea, which is still not out of the woods by any stretch."
"The full text of the new San Francisco Shelter-In-Place Order is posted at https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/Healt… . In addition to an extended time period, the new Order tightens the restrictions on activities that are permitted."
"I especially like the directive that all essential stores...grocers, e.g.....take out eateries must have a social distancing protocol. Already in place in Costco, TJs....should be in all."
"Jeeez,I go on TA today to read about travel and possible future trips to help pass the time and it’s like a Facebook gripe fest. Guess I’ll check back out and see you all in a few months when hopefully things are back to normal..."
"From Cuomo's press conference today regarding the apex:""It's anywhere from seven to 21 to 30 days. It depends on how that model rates how effective social distancing is,"" the governor said. ""We believe it is close to the shorter end of the range with our in-house people looking at the professional modeling that's being done.""He did not indicate April 30th if you read the second sentence.The second sentence is consistent with what he has been projecting.Edited: 9:17 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"I once again present this site which models whether each state will have enough beds and icu beds and ventilators and how long it will take to hit apex. California has a long time, based on current data, giving us time to mobilize enough resources: https://covid19.healthdata.org/projectionsYou can compare California with New York with every other state, too."
#50. He did on 4/1. I watch those every day. What he said today may have varied.
"Regarding Gov. Cuomo I recall after CA had SIP started he was still 'considering' the same for NY. I am convinced that the lag in deciding to do a SIP for NY contributed greatly to their huge cases and sadly deaths. Anyway, i'm all for a slow reopening of SF. In fact, if the SIP is extended further I am for it as I prefer human lives first."
"The model in #51 currently predicts our peak medical resource use date to he April 26. That suggests the ""end"" is far longer thah May 3. But at least we will not be overwhelmed like New York. Newsom has done an excellent job and is still scrambling."
"#53:I posted because what was attributed to Cuomo in his presser yesterday isn't what he said and there is enough misinformation going around as it is. I hope you keep in mind that not everyone has the luxury of still working or collecting a pay check during this and that when to start lifting restrictions is a complex issue based on demographics and outbreak trends even within a state (much of NY state is rural and far less dense for one and the numbers have not been exploding like in NYC and having a uniform pause has certainly made a difference) so implying that those who want to restart their livelihoods sooner than later value human life less than you is dismissive and overly simplistic. Our official ""pause"" took effect 3/23 but there were restrictions in NYC (such as cancellation of the St. Pat's parade) prior to that. It was the NYC mayor who was late to close schools there which was a mistake IMO."
"Unlike some one who was willfully denialist, Cuomo and Newsom acted on what was known to them and done so with activism and humility. My “favorite” is Korea, and they still sort of got it wrong initially but then embarked quickly with a strategy, and they are still not out of the woods. Theirs also require a huge stimulus. So will we, including in the future. There are some reports that nationally one quarter of all small businesses will not survive this.....and that is nationally not specific to urban areas like San Francisco where eateries were being hollowed out by delivery and to go even before SARS CoV 2."
"#55, this is #53 (my name is Lucie):I did not mean to offend you. My comments had nothing to do with your post. Just had to let you realize this fact. It was my observation, is that okay with you I hope? Because I did miss the part where the parade was cancelled and so on. I came in when he was considering a SIP mode.And I do realize that people have been furloughed and need to get back to their jobs. Well, excuse me, but I was not trying to sound selfish the way you portrayed what I meant. But thank you for thinking that.Edited: 3:09 am, April 04, 2020 "
