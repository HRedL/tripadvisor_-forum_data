I just read that Princess Cruise Lines is suspending all of their scheduled cruises for 60 days. I purposely looked for that update in today's newspaper but if it was there I missed it. Has anyone else seen or heard about this?

I usually find that it's often best to begin at the source--PRINCESS CRUISES ANNOUNCEMENT--Voluntary 60 Day Pause of Global Ship Operationshttps:/…global-ship-operations-pause.htmlVIKING ANNOUNCEMENT--https:/…index.html
KDKSAIL....I heard about it and then double checked the Princess web site for clarification...I did look at the print edition on line...This is going to hurt Bermuda if it is not lifted in 60 days . I had not heard about Viking...
Am o right in saying NCL are the most frequent visitors? Have yet to hear from them.
"So far, NCL appears to be the least forthcoming about its future plans regarding operations related to the Covid-19 virus...nor have they announced any cancellations of their regular Bermuda cruises""..Leaked Emails: Norwegian Pressures Sales Team to Mislead Potential Customers About Coronavirus..""--(Miami Times--Update, March 12, 2020)https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/coronavir…""..Norwegian Cruise Line managers urged salespeople to spread falsehoods about coronavirus..""--(Washington Post--March 12, 2020)https:/…"
"P.S...NCL and RCL are the most heavily invested in the Bermuda cruise market. NCL has two(2) ships ('Gem' & 'Encore.') scheduled to make fifty-seven(57) regular, weekly Bermuda port calls as well as six(6) more ships adding an additional eleven(11) more occasional Bermuda port calls. RCI has two(2) ships ('Adventure of the Seas..' & '..Grandeur of the Seas..') scheduled to make thirty-six(36) regular weekly Bermuda port calls as well as four(4) more ships adding an additional ten(10) more occasional Bermuda port calls. These two cruise line represent approx. 60% of Bermuda's seasonal cruise arrivals...and give the lengths of their port calls and the numbers of potential passengers...a MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT impact on Bermuda tourism revenues.."
"There's an age-old truism in Bermuda (that many in Bermuda Tourism have conveniently forgotten or ignored): '..When the US sneezes; Bermuda catches cold.."". Corvid-19 could involve ICU"
"It would appear that Norwegian Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean, and Ponant Cruises for the ship have suspended all of their Bermuda cruise arrivals--seven(7) between between March 13 and April 11, 2020...so far.""..Cruise ship visits suspended over Covid-19..""--(Royal Gazette--Mar 13, 2020)royalgazette.com/news/article/20200313/cruis…"
"Those of you booked on cruises that are being cancelled, it is for your benefit and others as well. I am from Trinidad and our total number of Covid-19 cases is 97 today. 40 percent of that number came off a cruise and were infected with the virus. This is very serious and while you would have worked hard for your money to spend on this cruise which I am sure is well deserved, it is not worth risking your life. When this is all over you can go on another cruise. Communicate with the cruise line and maybe you can get a refund.Edited: 10:35 am, April 03, 2020 "
Yea I think under current circumstances cruises will soon be paying potential customers to book. Sad but true
"I've never been too keen on the concept of spending a week aboard a ship cooped up with 4,000 strangers anyway, but these days, I wouldn't go within a mile of a cruise ship. I think from now on, cruise ships are going to have a tough go of it."
"It's going to be a while before a great many people walk along a jetway into an airliner or walk up a gangway into a cruise ship. The residual effect of the current crisis will linger. But of the two, cruising will probably be hardest hit and be longest to recover. I suppose the '..good news..' for the cruise industry is that Norovirus will seem much less of a risk in the foreseeable future."
"Good Morning,For those of you that may still have questions regarding cruise travel to Bermuda, you can find the updated information regarding travel restrictions through the Bermuda Government website gov.bm/articles/cruise-lines-suspend-travelWe would also suggest reaching directly to the cruise line you have booked with to find out more information and discuss options for future travel, and you can also check with the Cruise Lines International Association - cruising.org."
