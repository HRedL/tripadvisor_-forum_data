"Any impact there on daily life? Or on traveler experiences? There appear to be no cases reported yet.We're supposed to be on a ""Five 'Stans"" trip in May but I'm worried that won't happen now.Not trying to be selfish and worry about only my trip! But wondering if there's any feedback on how things are there.Thanks."
We are booked on Korean Air to fly to Uzbekistan from New Zealand transiting through Seoul also in May. Our final tour payment is due in less than 2 weeks and it's impossible to find out if there are any quarantine restrictions on arrival.I found one post that said 14 days if travelling via South Korea but that has now disappeared.
"Flying through S. Korea - I’d be really worried about that flight getting cancelled :(We decided to cancel and try again next year. I was too worried about what could be going on by May - borders closing, etc. Once the refund offer was over in March we’d be screwed if things were worse After that. I hate having cancelled. I’ve been planning this trip for years. Sad for us and for everyone in the tourism industry."
"There are currently no cases of coronavirus infection.Starting March 1, Uzbekistan Airways will temporarily suspend regular flights to Tokyo and Rome in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus in Japan and Italy. Regular flights to Seoul are temporarily suspended from the same date."
"I would not make any non cancellable bookings to Asia right now. It would not surprise me at all to see flights back into USA from Asia be banned. Sit tight- perhaps the situation will be more clear in a few weeks. What one has to worry about, a lot more than the virus, is the paranoia around it.Edited: 8:26 am, March 02, 2020 "
"So just seen a message on foreign office website that states ""anyone arriving from UK is subject to 14 days medical supervision at their place of residence and avoid contact with people and visiting public places"". I am confused so does that mean travel is off or is this just an advisory? I travel in about 2 weeks!!!"
The FO guidance looks to be only if you have travelled directly from or visited any of the specified affected countries within the last 14 days. Then you will be quarantined.If you are flying directly from the UK you are ok but anything could change over the next few weeks.
"For those doing a ""Five Stans"" tour, my tour company has told me that Turkmenistan has closed the border at least through the end of March. Tajikistan initially banned travelers from 35 countries (including the USA) but backed this down to only visitors from the 5 most affected countries."
"Have any tourist sights closed? I'd assume not, as there aren't any reported cases in the country yet. But it's hard to predict how people are responding."
"This is the last update 7th March 2020 on UK gov travel advice page for travel to Uzbekistan and Corona Virus. As I understand it British Nationals will not be able to travel around of visit sights for first 14 Days? Anyone else think this is what this means?British nationals arriving from the United Kingdom, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Malaysia or UAE are subject to 14 days medical supervision at their place of stay/residence and are advised not to visit public or crowded places and to limit contacts with other people. Arrivals from these countries are subject to medical monitoring by medical personnel during the 14-day period. This will include physical examination, measurement of body temperature and medical consultations by telephone. If symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections are detected) the person will be hospitalised in a medical institution for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment."
Hello I saw the same message on the French embassy website. But a local travel agent tells me that they impose quarantine only on people who have symptoms. I don't really know if I should cancel or not. I m supposed to leave in 4 weeks.
"US embassy is also reporting as of March 1 quarantine to home or hotel for 14 days is required if visitors have come from US. We are scheduled mid April. Somehow I think it will get worse before it is better. I expect, unfortunately, that my trip will be postponed."
"But US embassy also reports ....Quarantine Information:Suspected COVID-19 cases will be isolated in appropriate hospitals. At this time, there is no quarantine requirement for any asymptomatic individuals based on travel history.I should be leaving for Uzbekistan in a week but still don´t know what to do...."
"From https:/…""Individual passengers who have visited any of the foregoing countries or any of the following countries during the past 14 days will be subject to home/hotel quarantine (self-quarantine): the United States, France, Germany, Singapore, Spain, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.""I am not going to Uzbekistan to spend my time in the hotel. If you are traveling from Spain it sounds like that would apply to you as well."

"According to IATA website, at the present time Uzbekistan is not applying any measure. https:/…1580226297.htm"
I wonder if it is up to date as the US Embassy site stated that the Uzbekistan policy went into effect on March 6th.
"Hi I just thought I would update you guys..I spoke to Uzbek Embassy in London this morning who confirmed that there are no restrictions on movement on travellers from the UK as long as they do not present any symptoms of the virus. The embassy confirmed that 14 day medical monitoring is only a precaution and does not restrict movement within Uzbekistan. I believe the US state department travel advisory also confirms this. This advice is correct as of 9 March 2020 so of course keep checking for any updates or changes.Edited: 6:50 am, March 09, 2020 "
Thank you IbnBatuta10 for taking the trouble to check this.
"What if you're transiting through Spain, Germany or France?"
"Hello Apparently from France, they put you in quarantine only if you show some symptoms. For the moment anyway. That's what the Ouzbek embassy in France told me this morning."
"<>I could still go if that is the case for the US as well. It makes more sense than quarantining everyone who flies into the country.Edited: 8:44 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Just called the Uzbek embassy in Germany, they were referring to a document on their website, effectively stating whats written on the US and UK websites mentioned previously. Also called the French embassy and they said that there are no restrictions when coming from Germany or France, except sporadic temperature checks at the airport or so. This does not apply if you have visited Italy or China allegedly, then you have to quarantine. Same applies if you show symptoms. So this info is from today 10/3/2020, but check with the embassies yourself before you go.Edited: 5:07 am, March 10, 2020 "
We call the embassy and they told us that it was an advise but if you see down it does not explicitly says that people coming from the UK would be able to travel around. I asked someone at the embassy and they said it was only an advice but that does not mean we will be banned from travelling. We will try to cancel our tickets despite we have planned this for years.
So you think we can actually travel?
"They told me the same, that's it is an advice. Let's see, I guess we will try it out and see what happens."
"I called the Uzbek Embassy in Paris today as I'm supposed to travel to Tashkent April 1st. They said that the announcement of 14 days of quarantine is an official annoucement but the local travel agencies out there confirms that french tourist have no problem to cross the country freely. Even if it's a good news I don't know if taking the words said by an employee of the embassy for granted is a wise choice. Plus turkish airlines refusing the refund of my ticket, I really don't know what to do"
"Same thoughts here - on the other hand you can still take a flight back right away if your entry is refused. And Turkish Airlines refusing to pay you a refund actually shows, that there is currently no IATA ban implemented on the country... But not sure really whether it's worth the risk trying.Edited: 1:06 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Hi, due to fly on Sunday from London and received contrasting info from various embassies, travel agencies, Gvt etc.... would be great to hear from travellers already in the country!"
"Below I think is the most extensive advice out there from an official source courtsey of US state department. It mainly is aimed at US citizens but should answer a lot of questions here from other nationalities.""Exit and Entry Requirements and Quarantine Information:As of March 6, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reports no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Uzbekistan. The diplomatic community was notified March 6 by dip note of quarantine requirements which went into effect on March 1:In sum and as detailed below, American citizens who have spent time in the 14 days before their arrival in Uzbekistan in any one of a number of countries enumerated below, including the United States, are subject to home/hotel quarantine for up to 14 days. Americans who spent time in other countries enumerated below may be subject to medical monitoring while in Uzbekistan.Persons of any nationality who have been in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Afghanistan or Japan during the last 14 days and who are returning in “organized groups” will be placed in official quarantine in MOH-operated facilities. “Organized groups,” appears to refer to the groups of overseas Uzbekistanis being repatriated by the Uzbek Government.Individual passengers who have visited any of the foregoing countries or any of the following countries during the past 14 days will be subject to home/hotel quarantine (self-quarantine): the United States, France, Germany, Singapore, Spain, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.Passengers who have been in the following countries in the last 14 days are subject to home-based medical monitoring: Azerbaijan, UK, UAE, Thailand, and Malaysia. We understand that such persons are permitted to leave their home/hotel if asymptomatic.Finally, persons who in the past 14 days have been in any of the countries listed below will be monitored by telephone for 24 days: Bahrain, Kuwait, Armenia, Belarus, Oman, Pakistan, Georgia, Czech Republic, Iraq, Lebanon, Canada, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Sweden.Quarantine is applied based on location during the last 14 days, not citizenship, i.e. Americans having been in the United States during the last 14 days WILL be subject to quarantine, but Americans who have been in countries not subject to restrictions, such Kazakhstan, within the last 14 days will NOT be subject to quarantine.Visitors subject to self-quarantine must be kept in their place of residence (house, hotel, hostel, etc.) for up to 14 days, not be allowed to communicate with people other than family members, and not be allowed to visit public places.Uzbek authorities will examine travelers subject to home quarantine on the first day and last day of their quarantine, and conduct telephone monitoring on intervening days.Those traveling on diplomatic or official passports are not subject to quarantine requirements. Disciplinary sanctions will be imposed in the event of disciplinary violations by quarantined individuals.This complex framework is subject to change at any time."""
"Since reading all these posts and having to pay our $6,000 tour balance today we have now cancelled our Uzbekistan tour in May. We have also just been advised by Korean Air that they will waive our cancellation fees and get a full refund. Our tour company will also hold our deposit for 12 months against any future tour. Being in our late 60's we feel that there is nothing to be gained by putting ourselves at risk and are relieved to have finally made a decision."
"Totally agree PuhoiRiverLady. I was booked to leave Australia end May via Sth Korea. Have contacted the tourist company and they are happy to hold the deposit. So have decided to postpone until Sept/Oct. Small charge from travel company organising flights for change. But with you, am in my sixties. I want to enjoy an experience I have been waiting years for, not in a hotel for two weeks when I arrive and almost certainly in self isolation on my return. We haven't see the peak of this disease yet and it will take months for things to settle down. I am also relieved to finally make a decision. Also gives me heaps more time to read up!"
"Hi all. I also have an upcoming trip next month and unless the current self quarantine order stays for those coming from Singapore, I will have to cancel the trip. Really disappointed as have been wanting to visit for a long time. Any recent travelers from Singapore or from the listed countries requiring self quarantine receiving a different message on the ground? I understand that things can be very fluid at the moment (and not always updated), and hence would like to see if anyone is getting different information inside the country?"
"We are due to travel to Uzbekistan on a Mercury escorted tour on 27th March. Mercury are monitoring the situation and will notify us nearer departure.The advice from the Uzbekistan end seems a little conflicting in that we may be allowed in from the UK but might be quarantined, so there would be little point in going to spend the whole trip holed up in a hotel in Tashkent.Also from the Mercury brochure it seems unclear that if the trip was cancelled would we be refunded. We would if it was from advice from the FCO but if it was cancelled because of restrictions from the other end the wording is vague.We also have our own travel insurance, I have read that in these circumstances that some Insurance Companies are paying out and some are not.All rather confusing and worrying."
"Agree. Just cancelled my flights from London, and feel genuinely relieved! ..."
Here’s a phone number in case you want to check before flying: SES headquarters on the issue of coronavirus (+998) 71-2764966.
Elena - can you please tell me who is SES - the Uzbekistan tel number you have written with regards to finding out local on the ground info with regards to Uk nationals and Coronavirus arriving at immigration. Who is SES you refer to? Thanks
"Hey Alex, sure sorry: Senior Experts Services, an organisation which operates globally, the SES has an international network of representatives.Got this from the local travel agent Orexca/Advantour that booked my train tickets.Worth trying!"
"Just read the announbcement of the Uzben embassy in Germany (https://www.uzbekistan.de/en/nachrichten/nac…) and it all seems so arbitrary. I am flying from the Netherlands, so in theory I would be able to move around, but my friend is flying from Germany and he would have to be quarantained. But the Uzben authorities seem to forget that people travel without restrictions within the EU therefore exposing each other, so their country selection does not make much sense. We are flying in mid May, but I am afraid we will have to postpone the trip, as the situation is not expected to improve any time soon.Edited: 7:49 am, March 11, 2020 "
They don't have a service in English...
"Canceled as well today all the travel we had planned for next week. But the situations are changing too rapidly at the moment to predict, how the Uzbek authorities will react during the next days. Especially if you have passed through Germany or France.Edited: 7:07 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We too have cancelled our trip. I am really disappointed but like others have said before, there is no point staying in a hotel in Tashkent for 2 weeks and possibly having flights home cancelled or having to self isolate once back home.Edited: 7:32 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I am also due to travel to Uzbekistan on a touring holiday with Titan in couple weeks time. I have seen the same message by the UK Gov travel advise. I am only going for 11 days so how does this 14 days quarantine apply? Very ambitious.
So have you had any correspondence lately with Titan? we received all our tickets yesterday from Mercury for our departure on the 27th so it would seem that at this point it is going ahead but things could obviously change in the next couple of weeks.
"Do let us know what happens, we are due to go on June 1st, have to pay our final balance soon even though it is looking increasingly unlikely given the current restrictions."
"Just copied from Uzbekistan Airways webpage:The cancellation of entry visas on arrival (Visa on Arrival) to the country for citizens of Uzbekistan due to the spread of the coronavirus comes into force from March 13 to September 30, 2020."
The Uzbekistan airways announcement doesn't make sense...why would Uzbek citizens need visa on arrival that it is now being cancelled?
According to the UK Foreign Office those arriving from UK (and other countries ) are subject to 14 days medical supervision and advised to avoid public places. I am going to Uzbekistan in October which is a long way off so hopefully it will all have passed by then. I don't think the advice is all that clear - does it mean you have to stay in same place - if so no point in going. Hope those booked soon can enjoy their trip
I think the Uzbekistan Airways announcement is for Uzbekistan Passport holders who wish to go to Thailand. Thailand has recently suspended Visa On Arrival services and one of the countries that is affected by that is Uzbekistan.
Hello.I am living in Uzbekistan. Apparently there are no cases here but I don't believe that. I think the government is with holding any information as there have been allegations of it being here. Daily life is normal here. Many people just wear masks. The airlines are blocking entry to certain countries. I am leaving for South Africa in 2 months and hope all is well.
"That’s exactly what I’ve read, I’m supposed to fly on Tuesday but don’t fancy 2 weeks isolation in Tashkent. I’m booked to fly Uzbekistan airways so I’ll try and cancel or change flights till autumn.."
My transatlantic flight was just cancelled so next months visit is definitely off. I’m hoping October is a nice time to visit.
My dad currently lives in Uzbekistan. There’s no reported cases at the moment. He just got back from Istanbul to Uzbekistan with a cold and they tested him at the airport and got the all clear. Not sure what it will be like in May though...
"We were due to go April 23 but we cancelled. FIrstly we are both older and at risk. Secondly the fact that there are no ""reported"" cases doesn't mean there are no cases. I find that pretty hard to believe. Maybe they are not testing people. Thirdly the thought of being at an airport or on a plane for a few hours with potential carriers is too scary. We can always go next year."
"Reuters are now reporting that Uzbekistan has suspended all flights from France, Spain and Britain so doesn't look like we will be going on 27th"
Yes Confirmed now. Compulsory quarantine for UK citizens arriving from UK.
"Uzbekistan Airlines have cancelled all direct flights and regardless the nationality:... arriving in Uzbekistan and who have visited the United Kingdom, the USA, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan within 14 days of arrival are subject to home isolation/quarantine. You will be subject to monitoring and required to remain at your place of residence/stay for up to 14 days, not allowed to visit public places and required to avoid contact with other people excluding family members."
"Elena, That is not actually correct. Uzbekistan Airways have NOT cancelled ALL direct flights - only for .... Due to the restrictions on the entrance to the Republic of Uzbekistan of passengers from a number of countries, foreign citizens planning their travel to Uzbekistan from Paris, London, France.I am Australian flying from Dubai to Tashkent on Uzbekistan Airlines and currently that flight is still flying as of today."
"OMG this is becoming an interrogatory now! Flights FROM EUROPE AND UK sorry forgot. It’s up to you guys if you want to travel, good luck all."
"Reuter News:Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan close borders after first coronavirus casesWe can only hope this Covid 19 pandemic will be over, especially for those working in the tourism and F&B industries who are badly hit. I am still hoping to visit Uzbekistan in the very near future. Keep safe everyone. And stay positive. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…Edited: 2:11 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Uzbekistan airways has now suspended all international flights until April 5th.https://www.uzairways.com/en/press-center/ne…
"As of the morning of 16 March 2020, all commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended. Any UK nationals who have booked flights including those already in Uzbekistan, should contact the airline directly, or their travel agent, to discuss the implications of this measure. In addition all passenger road and rail traffic to and from Uzbekistan has been suspended and the Uzbekistan – Tajikistan border is closed.The Uzbek Government are trying to organise charter flights to repatriate Uzbek citizens from Europe. If these flights go ahead, they have offered to make spaces available to British nationals currently in Uzbekistan who want to return to the UK. It is by no means certain that it will be possible to arrange these flights, given the increasing number of restrictions on air travel world-wide. Nor do we yet know exactly when- or to where - in Europe they would fly.Any British citizens currently in Uzbekistan who wish to take advantage of these possible flights should send full passport details as soon as possible to Ukin.Uzbekistan@fco.gov.uk. Space on these flights is likely to be limited and we cannot guarantee that seats will be available for all. The Uzbek authorities will make a charge for seats on these flights."
The FCO have now advised against all but essential travel to Uzbekistan so at least anyone booked to travel in the near future will be able to get a full refund.
"If you’re stuck in UZ like I am, call your embassy so they know you’re here and can include you in numbers for the possible charters. The US embassy and Australian embassy were reassuring when we spoke to them yesterday. We’re still stuck, but at least they know we’re here."
"Unfortunately, coronavirus has also reached Uzbekistan ((Now the whole country is in quarantine. This means that people need not leave their homes unnecessarily. Employees of companies and organizations transferred to a remote type of work (from home). It is advised to go out only for groceries, to a pharmacy, bank or hospital.All citizens of Uzbekistan who fly to the country on charter flights must be quarantined for 14 days in specially designated hospitals or boarding houses.For foreigners who for any reason stayed in Uzbekistan, visas are automatically extended until May 5.People were required to wear masks in public places.In general, the situation in Uzbekistan, as in the whole world now. Let us pray and hope that all this will pass and people will begin to travel around the countries, as before."
Wondering how things are currently in the country regarding travel restrictions. Trip scheduled for June 1.
I assume you couldn't go? We have a trip in July and I assume we won't be able to go.
"We had to cancel our trip to Uzbekistan 2 weeks ago, but I came across some encouraging news:uzbek-travel.com/about-uzbekistan/… xinhuanet.com/english/…c_139098415.htmHopefully in 2021 we can finally visit this intriguing country!"
"Some more positive news:uzbek-travel.com/about-uzbekistan/…It might even be possible to plan something in 2020, though a lot remains unclear."
