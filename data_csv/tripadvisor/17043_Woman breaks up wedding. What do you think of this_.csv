A woman took it upon herself to break up a tiny wedding. What do you think of this?https:/…
That's a person that probably would keep your ball if it was on her grass. If she was that concerned she should have called the cops and let them handle it. There's a line that needs to be drawn between being a concerned citizen and being a bitch.
So much for romance ...
"This man has run an illegal operation for years. He was given a cease and desist order in April. He’s conducting business on a beach that is closed to everyone. They lied about the house being theirs. It’s being illegally rented. She called the police. We are told we need to be HPDs eyes and ears because they can’t be everywhere. If this was your neighborhood and someone was making money off a beach you aren’t allowed to use because of a pandemic, wouldn’t you be angry?"
"How sad!fishdiva said it well.It was a small wedding party that were going to be there for 15 minutes or so. Nothing wrong with that on a remote beach if they even were in the beach.That couple should have had great memories if their marriage. Instead they have memories of this woman.But then I watched the video on the link. And it gave me a different perspective.So, just to be a Devil's Advocate, the beaches are closed, this woman cannot use the beach that that the same minister uses over and over and she knows who he is and the beach house is an illegal. Not sure what I would do if I was this woman and this happened over and over and over and from an illegal rental right next to where I live.I blame this as much or more on the minister and the illegal rental than on the woman who has put up with this probably daily.So I am on the fence on this one!"
"Dusty, We get ticketed for standing on the beach, even for a second. We have to be moving directly into the water. If we get ticketed, they should too."
I think it’s very sad! What a shame! Hope she’s happy to have ruined their special day.
"PloverFun, You beat me too it as I was typing my response.I certainly agree with you after reading your response.I still feel sorry for the couple! This is their day!If this couple and the few with them are Hawaii residents, they know about beaches being closed.Can't blame them if they are not Hawaii residents and did not know the beaches are closed. But what about the 14 day quarantine?Can't blame them if they are Hawaii residents and the minister says they can get married in this area of the beach is legal!Did they know this was an illegal rental?I also can't blame them if this was a long time planned wedding and this was the best they could do.I'm still on the fence! But I blame the minister more than I blame the woman."
"On the video, they say they own the house. They don’t. It’s being illegally rented. They may not know that, but they lied when they said it’s theirs, which tells me they were told to say that. If they are on the property, it’s still illegal at the moment. Also, the woman who video-taped this is on the neighborhood board. Her constituents told her about this, that’s when she went down there. Most everyone here is cheering her."
I totally get that she is angry with them. Here in town cops are everywhere and people get chased from the beach all the time so why should the locals put up with tourists having a wedding on a beach? I also doubt they actually stayed put for 14 days inside this house during the quarantine. Renting an iIllegal house in residential neighborhood only aggravates the issue. With that said I would have never done what she just did. I'm not cheering her either. IMO Calling the cops would have been sufficient. I feel bad for the family and blame the minister for what have happened.
"PloverFun, I am on your side. My comments are minutes behind yours.There is much more than the OP's mention and the link provided."
"“ On the video, they say they own the house. They don’t.” If I had some woman screaming at me out of the blue, I’d probably say the same thing too.What do you guys think of a bunch of local teens on Kauai slashing tires and smashing car windows at a new low cost housing development on Poipu? I think that’s a little more disturbing than some couple standing on a deserted beach trying to make memories. And, yes, I would blame the “minister” and the authorities who haven’t made sure he was out of business long ago."

"I don't think anyone is his/her ""best self"" right now. Epidemic crabbiness and short tempers abound."
"""It’s just a wedding on a private beach.""There are no private beaches in Hawaii!"
"What she kept yelling seemed a lot more about the ""illegal house rental"" than anything about the wedding ceremony???"
"The woman's frustration is understandable due to the recent surge in Covid cases in Oahu as they just do not have the medical capacity to handle a spike, hence the tighter restrictions including closure of all beaches.  These restrictions apply to all residents and tourists, no exceptions.  Covid does not take a vacation because it is someone's wedding or honeymoon or anniversary or any other special occasion.  We personally are suppose to be there next month for our 20th anniversary and milestone birthday but understand that our celebration is not more important than their health and safety even though it means we are out of $2500 now. "
Really??? We're supposed to feel sorry for these people? People who blatantly ignore the laws of the state?Not a chance.
"I agree! This ""air"" of entitlement is old by anyone! I sure hope Joyce you had travel insurance. Hawaii will be there when it's time to travel safely. Aloha!"

Aren't new arrivals currently required to fill out a form which states where they will be staying?
Did they get arrested for violating the quarantine laws and the beach closure mandate?
"Mahalo Caddyshackman. Unfortunately because our accommodations is a time interval with set dates, the $2500 is for maintenance fee so we would not get our money back even though we did buy travel insurance. It's a use it or lose it situation. In fact, travel insurance does not cover even our airfare since we did not buy the additional ""cancel for any reason waiver"". I did not think I needed it as I booked this trip back in January pre-pandemic. It only covers if we cancel because we are sick but I believe we will get an air credit for the flight. I'm waiting and hoping they cancel our flight so I might be able to get my money back for that so we can maybe do an overnight locally for my husband's big birthday and our anniversary. Even with the bypass quarantine with the negative Covid-test option that was suppose to start next month, (which will probably be delayed due to a surge), because of the longer turnaround time to get results due to the backlog in labs on the Mainland, chances of having it in less than 72 hours is low. Without those results in hand BEFORE arriving, we feel the responsible thing to do to protect the people in HI is not go."
"The lady on the board did what she should, call the cops or the hotline. She had no business confronting these folks in a small wedding party. Her and ALL the other adults present behavior is despicable. It's even worse when children are there. There is no hope for the future (the kids) of our nation when adults behave this way. Being on a neighborhood board is no justification for any of this. No one knows if the members of this wedding party broke quarantine. They could live on island for all we know."
I would not call that a beach or a large gathering.
"I can see the confusion whether it's an actual beach especially if the minister told them it's ok to be there. No one sunbaths where these folks were standing . They were actually gathered right on a pathway where people walk or ride horses. Even the lady had to go out of her way to find them (as she triumphantly said 'they are hiding')And I am wandering... what was she doing on a beach herself since it's illegal to be there at the first place?I don't recall the exception for those wanting to chase others.Edited: 6:44 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"The vigilante woman was way out of line, way over the top.Was what the wedding party was doing wrong, I have no opinion. I don't know what is considered beach and what isn't. They weren't on the sand and that isn't in the confines Waimanalo Beach Park, so I am not sure on the legality. There were only about 10 people there.But regardless of their behavior, they didn't deserve the abuse from that woman."
">>> If this was your neighborhood and someone was making money off a beach you aren’t allowed to use because of a pandemic, wouldn’t you be angry?<<<No actually.>>>On the video, they say they own the house.<<<Where did you hear them say, ""we own that house"" on the video?"

Godwin's law. Took longer than normal.
"You are assuming much In your reply. Bottom line is Mayor Caldwell made a mandate. It applies to EVERYONE!!! Small intimate renewal vows to us Kanaka Maoli and residents of Oahu. Did she go over the top, well personally I would have handled it differently with the same result. But she was in the right. And they weren’t. Shame on the owner and Pastor conducting the ceremony. Bc he KNEW and admitted knowing!"
Yes they are required to fill out a form that includes where they are staying.
"Exactly! Nobody checks to confirm? I know it takes some effort, but these are tough times. Time to get serious. If word gets out that nobody is checking where you stay, that will be big trouble."
"Has it been established they do not live in Oahu. Really looks like the same old story, people who live on the beach want to keep it to themselves. We have been going to the beach every week, last week we went to Huntington, it is a huge beach, even though there were 1000s of people there it was no issue to find a socially distant spot. The wedding group was under 10 and it looked like all close family. I am not seeing a toga party. We need to learn what works and keep the good things so people can live as normal as possible"
"No one has established where they live. Could be tourists, could be residents, could be from a neighbor island."
"The long story on one of the news stations said they live on Oahu, but not at that property."
"OK, it wasn't a wedding, it was a ""vow renewal ceremony"" for a couple that lives on Oahu. The officiant has admitted that they were on the part of the beach that is closed and acknowledges that they were violating the executive order, and has also admitted that the group should have been wearing masks. The woman of the couple renewing their vows did state (it's on the video) ""that's our house,"" when confronted by the neighbor, which is a lie and indicates that they knew what they were doing was wrong.Bottom line: people's tempers are stretched very thin and tolerance for people who break quarantine, or defy the executive orders that are put in place to save lives, is basically nil. So, if you don't want to be challenged by people who have had it up to here with scofflaws, DON'T BREAK THE LAW."
"Just one thing to add here - on the point that the woman said ""that's our house"" - I could see myself saying that not at all meaning ""that's our home, that's a house we own"" - but rather ""that's the house we are staying in"". Whenever we are away from home I think I call our hotel room ""our room"" or our condo ""our condo"" or on the few occasions we've rented an entire small house ""our house.""So I think maybe there's a chance she could have meant ""that's the house we're staying in."""
">>>The woman of the couple renewing their vows did state (it's on the video) ""that's our house,"" when confronted by the neighbor, which is a lie<<<Did she say she owned the house? Or did she mean, ""that's where we are staying""? If I'm standing in front of Halekulani and I say to you, ""that's my hotel"", do you assume I own Halekulani?People seem to be quick to assume and assign the worst possible motives to other's actions according to their own biases.>>>and tolerance for people who break quarantine is basically nil<<<Who was a 30 minute vow renewal, in an isolated place, going to effect/infect? The crazy lady had to search them out to attack them."
"The marriage vow renewal party was not renting or staying at the house in question; the owner of the house has confirmed this.Edited: 6:50 pm, August 22, 2020 "
"Got it, so not a matter of phrasing then."
Phrasing. Boom. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHFl1z24KuY
">>> the owner of the house has confirmed this.<<<And you choose to believe the lady who owns the house because it fits your narrative.Unless the owner lives in the house full time and it is never a rental, I would be skeptical. Would you expect the owner to admit she rented the house illegally?"
"I know that I'm late to this party, but watched this video. What a horrible, hideous person. To interrupt a ceremony like this and with small children there. Another vote for the bitch category, regardless of the legal or not legal rental. I wonder if she would have “cared” as much if they were not people of color."
"Seems to me the whole closing the beaches, parks, trails is just over the top & really doesn't serve to contain Covid-19 all that much & in some cases drives people indoors. I can understand limiting gatherings but Oahu isn't even a place a resident can enjoy much less a tourist.https:/…"
"Agree 100%, clearly one thing we can all do for covid is to get in better shape and exercise, so you take away the right to visit outdoor areas, you take that away. My wife and I walk 3-5 miles a day, much of it in a park. Everything you read about covid indicates the greatest dangers are indoors"
