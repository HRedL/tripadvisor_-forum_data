A couple of us have asked on other people's query but no answers yet. Has anyone actually received a refund for a cancelled holiday due to the corona virus. This is not trying to knock Tui but I am trying to get a picture of the position.
"Tui have acted disgracefully of late. We were promised a refund a month ago & nothing had been credited to the account of late. Letter,e mail,messenger & phone contact has been ignored by them. Publicly they have said very little.If they had publicly informed people,many like us would accept & wait for 'normality' to return.There are many forums on fb (I've seen the thousands of comments & responses) & it's fair to say that many think the worst for them & if they are to carry on trading,very many wont ever book with them again. People understand the awful virus situ,the closure of shops,furloughing of staff etc but are very unhappy that when paying Tui-everything is fast. Getting refunded by them is almost impossible. Tui have stalled hoping for an extension of the 14 days funding rule by ABTA. It's also true that Tui Germany have had a bailout at Tui UK's expense & that makes very many unhappy too & does nothing to dispel fear.A claim for a refund via ATOL is looking likely as is a potential chargeback on either credit card or as we used-debit card should also be asked at the bank. Our bank has said we can submit a claim in june after 90 days if Tui as we think, fails to refund us."
Scarletrugby thanks and unless there are more comments from people receiving refunds it would seem that they are stalling for a change to the rules/law to enable them to delay/refuse refunds.
"Quite true & they (Tui) are doing an exceptional job of it too. Scandalous for many reasons.If only Tui UK were to put out a statement saying due to obvious reasons, refunds will be actioned when able to & send out an e mail confirming the refund. However they have not done anything & this will be their undoing if they survive. People will remember that they were treated with utter contempt by them & respond accordingly too. It also shows how worthless the ABTA logo is too.Tui are ignoring the legal requirement to refund within 14 days & acting with impunity. Scandalous."
"I have received an email this morning from Tui regarding my flight which should have been on the 15th April , i have been told that I will receive a refund credit which is valid until 31/10/2021 , if this is not acceptable then I can exchange it for a cash refund next April ( 12 months after the original booking. ) Really unsure about this though because what happens if tui collapses between now and then ? Any advise will be greatly appreciated."
"We have had no e mail but I've seen it as it's on a few fb forums & on TUI site too.Our hol cancellation notice was sent to us mid march & we await a full refund-maybe!Reading the notice,once you have the cancellation e mail,contact them for a refund instead of accepting the credit voucher. Failing that consider ATOL &/or a bank chargeback if used a cc or dc to pay if nothing materialises from this new info.Edited: 11:52 am, April 17, 2020 "
"Babs refund credits are backed by Abta/Atol. If you want a refund then contact TUI, but be prepared to wait quite a while for it. You could also make a Section 75 claim with your credit card provider or obviously you can use the credit to book another holiday. You can't make an Atol claim for a cancelled flight.As with everything travel related at the moment, bucket loads of patience is required."
TUI have updated their policy today at 16.00https:/…coronavirus
"It does also state on this notice that once your credit voucher code e mail has been rec'd by you (for those that get an e mail) if you still want the fund as cash instead,then contact them.Edited: 12:58 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"It also saysI REQUESTED A REFUND BEFORE YOU OFFERED A REFUND CREDIT, WILL I STILL RECEIVE MY REFUND?Yes, if you’ve already requested a refund you’ll receive this back to your original payment method. We’re trying to process these as quickly as possible so please do bear with us.Edited: 6:32 pm, April 17, 2020 "
A glimmer of hope. My friends that were travelling just before us have now received a refund of the £250 deposit they paid. Now there is some confusion as to why its the £250 deposit that has only been refunded. For some reason my friends paid the deposit on their bank card and the remaining balance on their credit card so we are hoping they have refunded the lot but it just takes a bit longer to show up on a credit card? Anyway something is happening and hopefully this will give you all a bit of hope for getting your money back. I will update during the week as things develop but I was due to fly 4 days after them so I am hoping by the end of the week I have my money back. I paid for the whole holiday on the same card so hopefully this will be easier when it comes to refunds.
Paulh can you say the date your friend was leaving. I hope you are correct and they are dealing with refunds.
We had a phone call sat lunchtime from Holiday Hypermarket who said our refund is being actioned & we were then sent an e mail of the transaction after it was sanctioned.This morning we had a message via messenger from a HH rep who we have liaised with many times saying it will be in the account asap. Holiday Hypermarket have been nothing but helpful to us in the many years we have been booking mainly long haul holidays with them. Tomrrow hopefully is the day!!!
Today is the day-refunded in full by HH for our cancelled holiday to Cabo (Mexico) way back in march. Best of luck to all others with their refunds.
"Still waiting for refund. Had a call from TUI 16/3/20 asking if we wanted to amend date of holiday but I said no has we already have another rwo holidays booked with them May and September this year. I was told a refund would be requested, on the 17/3/20 received email saying full refund would be processed by 18/3/20 to credit card that I had paid with. To date nothing received and no communication with TUI. Also no communication at all about May holiday."
"My friends had refund within two days of phone call this was 16 March say day as us no refund for us. They paid with credit card we did not, I am guesing credit card holders will get money first."
It makes no difference how you paid as to the order refunds are processed in.
"Credit Card buyers can dispute. Others can't, so yeah, you'll be later . . . if at all.How did you pay?"
"<< Credit Card buyers can dispute. Others can't, so yeah, you'll be later . . . if at all. >>Yes they can. Debit card payers can raise a chargeback."
"True, but at least in the US the bank is a much stronger ally in a CC chargeback as it's their money at stake. With a DC, it's your money at stake"
"LeyLand10 #18 sorry but you are just wrong on that. Do your research, please!"
I suggest you do yours Lucille.
"Lucille, you may wish to do some research first before you make incorrect claims...https:/…how-do-i-use-chargebackhttps://www.visa.co.uk/chargeback.html"
"<< True, but at least in the US the bank is a much stronger ally in a CC chargeback as it's their money at stake. With a DC, it's your money at stake >>True. With a cc the provider refunds then tries to reclaim the money, but as the legal right is to a refund TUI have no grounds on which to deny a chargeback."
"I’m not due to fly out to Rhodes till 30 may ,have I got to wait 14 days before I can get my money back , I paid on debit card ..:"
Tania..have TUI cancelled your flights yet?
Why Tania ? You should always pay at least part of a booking like that on a credit card - it offers you valuable protection should the product or service you are buying not work out
TUI have only cancelled up to 14th May inclusive.
"Yes, full refund received. due to fly 15/4, called 14/4 refunded within 8 days."
"Hiya untidymum1I rang yesterday we were supposed to travel on 30/4. The lady I spoke to had a look and came back and said yes I’ve cancelled it and you will get a refund back to your card in 48 hours. I was surprised at this and asked for a reference number but she said your booking reference is the number. I haven’t had an email either. I just wondered if you had any verification from them?When I look on my account the holiday is not showing now, however it is on the app. It was just straight forward so I am a bit dubious as to whether we will get the refund. I hope so as I was hold for an hour and half so I don’t want to have to ring up again."
"Untidymum1 Can you say which number you rang. Was it the one on the website, how many times did you ring and were you on hold for a long time? When I originally asked I was skeptical that they would refund anyone but they seem to be better than Ryanair and I am hopeful of a refund even if it takes a few weeks."
"Hiya,Just an update to my previous post, we have received a full refund from Tui this morning when I checked my bank statements.ROBERTMthe number I rung was 02034512868, that was the first time I rung them and I was on hold for 90 mins. It was straightforward apart from the wait."
paradiselover Thank you for the information and whilst not getting carried away there may be hope for Tui customers if your experience becomes typical. I don't think anyone would be surprised by the wait on the phone.
"Further to my earlier post, received full refund to credit card 22/4/20 for a holiday cancelled 17/3/20 by TUI due to have travelled 28/3/20Waiting to see what happens to next holiday due to depart 16/5/20!!!!!"
"Still haven't had anything for my holiday cancelled 13/03, bank are starting chargeback for it."
"I spent 1.5 hrs on phone on the 9th April to get through was offered £125 per person discount if I rebooked. I asked for refund.i had an confirmation email that day saying it was being processed, then I got a refund confirmed email on the 17th and full refund in my bank account on the 20thEdited: 8:14 am, April 28, 2020 "
#26Why Tania ? You should always pay at least part of a booking like that on a credit card - it offers you valuable protection should the product or service you are buying not work out.Not everyone chooses/qualifies to have a credit card.
Yes I have had a full refund from tui last week the biggest problem in have is getting it from Barclaycard back onto my current account. I certainly don't want to pay charges
How did your Friends get in contact for a refund I can’t even get through to the phone
can i use my refund credit code(when i get it) to pay an existing holiday that im not named on? its my friends
Have two holidays booked with TUI that have been cancelled due to COVID-19 outbreak. I have received a generic email from TUI about one holiday due to depart 03.04.20 advising of cancellation and they would be in contact. and another today 29.04.20 about a holiday due to take place 23.05.20 with information about credit notes etc. I have tried to contact TUI via email and telephone for a number of weeks without success. What can I do as TUI are breaking the law as I should have received a full refund for the holiday to Bali which should have been refunded within two weeks of cancellation. If TUI go into receivership where will I stand with credit notes and refunds. Both holidays were booked via credit card. Am wondering if I should claim via credit card for full refund.
Been trying for hours then got answer and been told to ring different number TUI are a total disgrace.
"Jane J - see this snippet from https:/…bookedRefund paid to your credit card? Ask for it to be transferred to your bank account for freeThose who receive holiday refunds get it returned to the payment method used. This can often mean being £1,000s in credit on credit cards. And many have contacted us worried that they'll pay the usual 3% ish fee to pay this into their bank account - yet those are money transfer fees, for shifting debt.If you're significantly in credit, you should be able to ask your provider to transfer the credit back into your bank account free of charge. You can do this by getting in touch with your provider directly - online or via its app if you can, as phone lines are likely to have long waits - and requesting a “refund of credit balance”.All the providers we spoke to, including major names such as Barclaycard, HSBC and Lloyds, told us they do offer this service to customers.But if your provider refuses to transfer your credit back to you for free for some reason, you can appeal to the financial ombudsman - and do so on the grounds that it’s not following standard industry practice. There’s full info on how to do this in our Financial Ombudsman guide"
Yes we Have. We received our refund. We were due to go on the TUI Discovery 13th March cruise of Asia.
We were due to travel on march 17th and were cancelled on march 15th got email for a refund and also a confirmation of refund due. They said it would be paid in 4 weeks. Still waiting!! Got another confirmation email today still no money. Can't email back can't get through by phone either Very disappointed with the service
I have just seen a message on one of the Balearic Island forums from somebody who has just had a 6 June Departure holiday cancelled by Tui and they are offering him a credit for future bookings of full value paid plus 20% (not one of these ABTA refund credit notes mentioned previously)
My holiday was paid direct debit so i am hoping like thomas cook they will refund full amount into my bank I only waited 10 days when they went burst x fingers crossed
I had a call on the 17th March to say that my holiday on the 26th March was cancelled due to Covid 19I was told i would have a refund within 2wks...not happened yet. Another call after the 2wks were up....it would be another 2wks....not a penny yetI saw somewhere that it maybe after the 1st MayIf this carries on I’m taking Tui to a small Claims courtDreadful customer relations. They are quick enough at taking our cash...
"TUI have now cancelled all holidays up to 11th June so, imo, expect further delays in getting refunds as they get absolutely swamped with the next wave of newly affected customers.Edited: 5:26 pm, April 29, 2020 "
Gaildorfblues yes I think you're correct as I tried 5 times to get through and no real luck. The two times I got past an initial message saying that they could not take my call after making the choices offered I was cut off by the voice saying they were too busy to take the call. The choices offered gave no clear way to get to an operator to ask for a refund. Hopefully things will improve in the future?
"Robert, have you tried contacting them by messenger on their facebook page? I tried that route a few weeks ago & it worked, though things may well have changed since then. My apologies if you have mentioned trying that option already on the thread as, I haven't read all of the posts."
"morning allall i have received so far is my deposit which i paid by debit card the main balance was paid through paypal of which i have not received this was for a march holidayi cannot get through on the phones my emails bounce back, pretty poor from TUI and of course being a regular traveller does no go well for them in the future at the moment i am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, if nothing by the end of may will take action through paypal"
"Just tried the Tui number and it seems to have "" blown up!"". The line just goes dead so I suppose they are being swamped with calls. Like previous posters I am prepared to wait for a reasonable time as I know it is difficult for them. I do hope they do the right thing as I like others have used them in the past and want to use them again. How companies treat their customers now may determine if they will succeed in the future. After all if possible we will want to travel in the future."
"I Booked In store and were advised by TUI to come back in with my card and be re funded due to our holiday been cancelled on the 29th of March . I went in store and the lady put my card in the terminal and told me she had paid the refund back to my card , she stated it wouldn’t reach me for 7 working days . This was mid March and nothing has gone into my account!!! I can’t contact them as all stores are closed etc . The reason I always book in store is it makes refunds easier etc . TUI has really gone down I may now be using other company’s for holidays . I will also be claiming compensation as I’ve been took for a mug . We travel 4x per year with TUI and this is the service they give ."
"""I will also be claiming compensation as I’ve been took for a mug""---I don't think there's anything in eu261 regulations for compensation for being taken for a mug. Maybe keep trying to contact them?"
I called yesterday and after 90 minutes got through. Asked for a refund and this was set up and was told it should be with me within 5-10 days. I had paid online in partial lumps with my debit card. Today I have received part refund. Don’t know why I have not received it all in one lump. Any suggestions?
"You paid in instalments so you'll likely receive it back in instalments. I think you're extremely lucky to have got anything back in your account at all, let alone so quickly. The rest will follow.Edited: 7:17 am, April 30, 2020 "

Hi any update to this?
"On Tuesday the powerful Commons transport committee of MPs confirmed plans to investigate the issue in a series of hearings with aviation bosses next week.The committee chairman, Tory MP Huw Merriman, said: 'Yes, airlines have a need for cash but this should be drawn from their lenders, not from passengers who are legally entitled to a refund. On 6 May we will look at aviation including: ￼the financial position of airlines and airports ￼passenger and consumer issues such as refunds ￼air travel as the restrictions are eased Find out more and submit your views: Email transcom@parliament.ukCome on everyone email them."
"Hi all. Just an update on what tui have just said to us on the phone. So we had our holiday cancelled by tui. Was due to travel 20/04. We had an email confirmation of our refund on 09/04 which stated that it would be within 4 weeks for a refund.Today is 4 weeks and still no refund. However after many phone call attempts on different numbers today, we finally got through and transfered numbers. The lady said that the finance department are manually doing refunds, and there are 1000s. Which we totally understand. She then told us that they have extended the period of refunds from 4 weeks, to 6 weeks. Which again we totally understand. Just a shame we had to go through multiple numbers and advisors to tell us that. So stay positive, they are working through them. It's just a game of patience and understanding!"
HiI got my refund voucher code by email today - and after 90 minutes on the phone I eventually got through. The conversation only took a couple of minutes and I have since received another email confirming that I should get the refund to my credit card in 7-10 days.
I forgot to say that was for a holiday depating 16th March cancelled two days before we were to travel - so the refund delay has been around 6 weeks.Good luck to everybody.
"Yes but was due to travel 25th march paid in full for holiday but received just the deposit back £400 pounds today 30th April still owed £2,000"
"Just to let you know I was flying on 26th march today 30th april just received my £400 deposit back paid on same card still owed over£2,000 back"
"I was due to travel on 31st March and was told by TUI that I would receive my refund by 1st May (apparently this is for all bookings up to 11th April). I received a refund receipt yesterday for the full payment of our holiday, this hasn't hit my account yet but apparently the refund has been confirmed. I hope this may help. TUI are processing it seems, although I still dont physically have the money yet!"
"I assume you have to wait for the email first, but, I'd been in touch with their Twitter account and they said to ring a certain number, I've tried several times a day for the last five days to make the call I either get cut off straight away, get through keying 221 to get to the required part and then get cut off, only once in all the calls have got to a stage where they have said you are in a queue and may have to wait an hour to get through, (which had I waited would have taken me beyond their opening hours). I fully understand that companies are going to be busy. But why do they have to go through this laborious system? I hate it at the best of times. If you ring a company and it's engaged, it means they are busy, full stop, try again later, the call hasn't cost the caller anything. I think during the five days I must be getting close to using my entire month's minutes, and haven't got to speak to a human.Edited: 3:14 am, May 01, 2020 "
I had that in march the receipt but just received £400 pound refund the deposit but still owed me the rest
"Hi Briatolx, so did you receive a confirmation of refund receipt but yet no refund physically received?"
I was due to travel on the 25/3/2019.. I was promised a refund on the 17/3 but nothing. managed to get through on the 30th and they said mine had slipped through the net. Promised a call back nothing happen. Disgraceful now put a chargeback request in. Got nothing back yet

We have received a full refund paid by credit card bur we are still waiting for a smaller amount paid by pay pal our holiday date was 20-3-2020. Refund was paid to our card 26-4-2020
"Hi everyone xI was due to fly on March 27th, heard from Tui on 17th March confirming holiday cancellation, I didn’t contact them and waited for them to get in touch. 20th March I received a refund for my excursion with Go Tui, they sorted this automatically. 21st March decided to call them, agreed a refund although was offered a free amendment. Holiday was for a milestone birthday so didn’t want amendment. confirmation email I received re the refund confirmed the amount due back and says should receive it within 4 weeks, however I was told on phone it would be 10-14 days. after a month of waiting, I called them and on hold for around 45mins, was told there was a huge back log due to staff working from home and he would chase them up relevant team. Didn’t receive a confirmation email or anything about it after the call. Chased them again a week later (5 week wait now) was advised that they could not tell me when I’d be refunded but they’d get in touch and call me. I asked why I would be expecting a call when we already agreed a refund 5 weeks ago, he didn’t have an answer I guess he just had to answer the phones to reassure people. I never received that call from TUI or any further updates but a week later (6 weeks later now on 1st May which was yesterday), TUi emailed twice confirming Separately they’re refunding second payment /deposit of £300 and the second email was confirming refund for bulk amount paid for holiday. didn’t receive an email re the first £100 deposit so I am still waiting. The email doesn’t specify a date but says: “We’re writing to let you know that the following refund has been confirmed. The remaining balance is shown below for your records.” So my remaining balance is the £100 and then it will all tally up hopefully when received. The originally first deposit of £100 was paid for on a different card, not sure if that is why I Haven’t heard back on that one. Anyway what I am trying to say is they are refunding in parts and not one entire big bulk by the looks of it. As it was a Friday afternoon after 4PM I didn’t expect the refund that day or this weekend. Hopefully it’s there on Monday which by then will be 6weeks and 3 days of waiting for the refund. Sorry for the long post but I hoped that may help someone. I have always had a good experience with Tui and fly with them very year but I don’t think it is acceptable to be told 10-14 days for a refund on the phone, then the email says one month and then over 6 weeks later still haven’t received it. I will post again when I have an update xx"
We Booked a holiday and paid in full at point of booking and were due to fly on a Tui holiday to Fuerventura on 17th March . Tui cancelled our holiday a couple of days before and had a call from them offering a full refund but it would take 10 days. I had an follow up email from them confirming thie refund . I rang a couple of times and customer services it was all with another department to make payment. Then I see on there web site we should receive payment by 1st May. That certainly hasn’t happened. Annoying thing is we cancelled our holiday insurance on the strength of this! I can see we are not alone!I would like to email customer services but there is no email address. The lady that emailed me originally is out of office...probably furloughed! Anyone got a working email address?
I have not even received an email from TUI to acknowledge my flight which was cancelled to Goa on the 09/04/2020. I have tried calling them and even sent emails which have been bounced back.
Anyone else been told they’ve now got to wait another 15 days for there voucher let alone a refund. I don’t have the time to call them. I’m still working and have young kids so can’t call them in the evening and the couple times I have called I haven’t even been able to get a dial tone
"I have had the opposite experience. The payments I made using my credit card have been refunded, the ones I made using my debit card are still awaited. Thankfully the majority of the cost was made on my credit card but I’m still £250 short for the one payment I used using my debit card. I now cannot get through to them by phone to ask what’s happening.... frustrating!"
"We are still waiting for a full refund.our holiday wasn't cancelled because of the virus but because the hotel that we booked hadn't finished the renovation it was having done but tui quite happily took our money that we paid in full.im trying to get in touch but having real problems.its a joke really,we need to pay for our August holiday this month but as I can't get through I'm not sure if we will lose our deposit or not,I guess it's just wait and see."
My holiday was cancelled 17th of March and went in store 18th of March to get my refund.was told 7 to 10days but it's over 7wks now and still no refund.spoke to someone last wk on the phone after loads of call and been cut off 2 hours a time waiting.was told refund would be in the 1st of May....guess what 1st of May no money what a joke
Can anyone who has been successful please state how they got through to Tui. My experience is that you either get a message straight away saying they cannot take your call or after going through a couple of the options you then get a message saying they cannot take your call! Is it just a case of keeping on dialling the number and hoping you can get to a person after waiting.
"Update ( of sorts) managed to get through after navigating the various options and holding for 30 minutes to be told, after speaking to a supervisor, that they could not refund me as they didn't do refunds and transferred me to the crisis (??) team when the phone went dead. I was prepared to give Tui the benefit of the doubt but I am a beginning to suspect they will not do the right thing by the customer. Will keep on trying!!"
Our holiday was cancelled on the 18th March and a refund agreed. Told it would be 3-4 days before it arrived in our account. STILL WAITING!!!!! 7 weeks later. We would have gone and be on the way back by now! Trying to be patience and of course the longer the monies are in TUI's account the more interest (albeit very little) they are getting.
"Today's experience:Due to travel 22nd MarchPhone call from TUI 21st March. Requested refund and was advised it would take 7/10 days30th March received email from TUI confirming full refund amount but to be paid in 4 weeks. Nothing received by 1st May.Contacted TUI today (4th May), 12 attempts to get in queue and then 1 hour on hold.Admittedly very helpful lady had to speak to Manager and then advised refund will be made in another seven days back to credit card.Asked if they meant it this time and she repeated what her manager had told her.Ah well, fingers crossed."
"Our holiday was booked in store , we were told bank transfer being done immediately when our holiday was cancelled on 14th March, I have been in contact numerous times only to be told I should have had by now, I am worried in case it has gone somewhere else, now I can't get through to them.."

"My holiday was 7th April. I finally got through on 8th April after trying for 3 weeks and following that call instantly received a cancellation email which is basically the proof the holiday has been cancelled to enable the refund. I think if you didn’t initially agree a refund verbally you don’t receive this cancellation email and there’s a new process now that you get the email automatically with the credit code and 20% Rebooking incentive and then still have to ring up to request the refund. I was told back then that holidays booked online are more instant and a different system to those booked in store, mine was in store typically! I then had to wait 2 weeks for the in store team to contact me with details of the refund. I asked the girl ok what’s the realistic timescale, she said 4 weeks from the cancellation email. Anyway that’s around now so I rang up again today and got through after 1.5 hr wait and the girl took the reference on the store letter (not the booking ref) and got all my details up and requested the bank account details for full refund to be made. I paid on credit card but she said they are refunding via banks (I have nothing in that account anyway incase anything went wrong!) was told it was now being emailed to the refund team and it’s usually taking up to 4 weeks for the refund to go through but as my holiday is quite old now being a month ago, then they are going through quicker as based on departure date, and she’s seen them take a week. obviously I haven’t had the physical refund yet but thought I’d give a update, must say they’ve been very pleasant whoever I’ve spoken to, it’s not their fault after all so although we’re all frustrated at the company it’s not the individuals fault and they’re just trying to help thousands of customers that I imagine some can be quite aggressive. I don’t think that gets you anywhere, apart from being put to the bottom of the pile!"
Hi I was told on 23rd March over the telephone I would get a refund and they took the preferred card it be sent to. As I was told over the phone will I still be getting my refund and when should I expect it please?
"As an update from my earlier post, I have finally refund two refunds for the second and third payment of my holiday. As mentioned previously we received two separate emails on Friday 1st May confirming the two amounts to be refunded. We are yet to receive the initial £100 deposit email confirming the refund. I hope that gives others hope that they too will be refunded and confirms we will be paid back in parts according to the instalments paid. For ease and to sum up, I had spoken to TUI on 21st March re wanting a refund for my cancelled holiday which was due to be on 27th March. ReceiveD two emails re 2 out of 3 refunds on May 1st and was refunded those on May 5th. Good luck x"
"My holiday for 1st june was officially cancelled last week, so I received the email re.. voucher refund. Called them (understandably not easy) eventually got in the que waited 40 minutes to speak to someone.said I wanted cash refund no problem it's in my bank today.i had no issues at all thank you tui ."
Layla32 great news on your refund. Can you say which options you took to get the refund as I presume you have not had the refund voucher code.
"Whilst I have some degree of empathy with TUI, the way that they are handling the refund requests is awful and should have been dealt with differently.Getting hold of them by phone is almost impossible. Why not have the option to electronically request a refund through the ""My booking"" section of their website? It almost feels like they are putting customers off requesting a refund in the hope that they give up and accept the credit voucher being offered.Makes me think twice to book with them in the future. £5k is a lot of money in their pocket rather than mine!"
"I had a conversation with TUI on 21 March when my holiday was cancelled. I advised that I would like a efund and was told that it could take five to six weeks for this. Today, seven weeks on, I have received a refund credit code. They have completely ignored my instruction and this is contrary to their advice on line for holidays booked before 16 April and a refund already requested. Impossible to even get in a queue to speak to anyone on the phone. Do I want to book with them again??"
"I didn't take the voucher refund because we are a group of four nurses that have been redeployed at present.And as such we are unable to book annual leave together.so we've banked the cash to maybe make plans after this crisis .hopefully next year will be our year xx I never received voucher codes as soon as it was mentioned via emails I called tui it took ages but I was persistent and finally got in a long que xEdited: 1:09 am, May 06, 2020 "
Martin Lewis has published some guidance on TUI refunds which may help here:https:/…
Yes this morning full refund for Marella cruise depart date 14th April .. I had email promising refund on 26th March ... received refund for excursions on 21st April and the rest came through today. I am so relieved and wanted to share with you all the message to hang in there.
Hi. I hope they’ve got the full refund. I don’t suppose you know the date that your friends were travelling. We were supposed to be travelling on the 27th of March and are owed the full price of a holiday which we are still waiting for. Thank you
"ABC post#95 Welcome to the forums. Unfortunately the reply buttons dont work, your post just goes to the top of the thread so you need to specify who you are asking or even send them a PM."
"I had a holiday due to depart on the 13 April with tui ,and did not here from them once to inform me of the cancellation or since. Unable to contact them for a refund so initiated a claim back from my credit card, which is now in my account."
"Hi, we had our refund yesterday, to be fair our flights were cancelled on the Monday and the following Wednesday the refund was received.It took a great deal of perseverance, we didn’t wait for the refund credit, just kept trying the refund number, we finally got into a queue and after an hour and half wait the call was answered, we requested a refund they said OK. A couple of days later the money had been refunded."
I’m still waiting for the refund me and my friends were offered in March can’t get through on the phone they don’t answer emails
"I finally got through to tui today after being on hold for an hour, I was told that my refund will take three to four days to go back on my credit card. The operator was very helpful"
Still waiting after 8 weeks. No info since store closed and no-one answers the phone Have written two letters to Head Office in Luton. No reply
"HiThe full refund hit my credit account after 3 days of calling them with my credit voucher reference number - all sorted - total wait from cancellation around 6 weeks.Good luck & persevere!Edited: 4:56 am, May 08, 2020 "
Due to fly 28th March refund requested and initiated in store 15th March confirmation email received 19th March.Refunded yesterday but about £90.00 short!.Will call it done not worth the hassle for the remaining amount.
We were due to fly 28 March.Went in shop to process refund. About 21st March I think..We’ve heard nothing since...
"Yes,had to hold the line for 45 mins, but finally got my money back."
"our holiday to mexico was for 23 march, just a few days into lockdown, i had an email on 21st march to confirm our booking was cancelled and i wold have a refund of £4200, i have heard nothing since and certainly not had a refund or any hope i will get this money back"
To update.... finally got through to them and refund processed. Money in my bank account within 2 days. That is for a holiday cancelled and was went to depart on the 14th May.Operator was helpful when I eventually managed to get through to them. Wait once in the queue was about 2 hours though!
"7 weeks and counting since we had our holiday cancelled, we should have been on holiday 3rd may and as per the last post we haven't heard anything from Tui, not an e mail or even a phone call to explain whats happening, i tried for weeks to get a hold of them to no avail, its only in the last few days i finally spoke to someone and got told to expect a refund voucher or refund notice for today Friday 8th May, well guess what, surprise surprise, it ain't happened!!it Gauls us because we followed their on line request to basically be patient and wait for them to contact us which was supposedly in date order of holidays pending, it really is beyond a joke and i feel we have been fobbed off on the phone with not being given a date when to expect the refund, or even someone contacting us........ instead of the other way round,im sure others are having similar problems so really just posting to see if anyone has been refunded who may have been travelling a similar time, , its now 5 days past our travel date and reading the posts from others i get the feeling we are in for a long haul and im starting to doubt and worry Tui will be in a position to pay us anything, I think i'm right in saying Tui are the biggest travel company in the country and maybe Europe but they need to sort out current paid up customers in the correct manner and timescale or they wont have returning customers again for sure......assuming Tui get through this and survive to pay us all !!!"
"Hi my problem is trying to pay deposits for 2 holidays as I paid the low deposits when booking.I have tried every number and cannot get through, as I booked in store I cannot pay through manage my booking, has anyone managed to find a way of paying them ? All the stores are closed.If TUI looking at this please help, I thought TUI needed money to refund people and I can’t be the only one trying to pay."
Had enough of tui all together I’ve spoken to 4 different advisors each time I’ve called all different stories I was promised a refund on the 10/04 then I’d called back a week later as I paid in cash and only £1000 on debit card and they said we have your bank details the finance team will be in touch with you in 7 days to authorise the refund so 7 days later called back they said oh it says we haven’t got your bank details so took them over the phone ready for when they contact me the same day apparently so called back afew days later as still hadn’t heard anything for the advisor to say we can’t keep your bank details and it says here on the screen in front of me have not told him when he will receive the refund !! All tui are doing here by telling people different things each time they call and dragging it out is going to cause problems for the staff in store as they are making me and a lot of other people very angry and as i had booked I store and got told it was 12 weeks to the day I had to pay full balance instead off the £1000 deposit so I paid it in full on the day thank god we didn’t book for next year as we fly with tui atleast twice a year and after all the passing from this department to that department and making me jump through every hoop I will not be giving tui my custom again !! Apologies in advance to the staff In store if I do not receive my refund by the time stores open but thank your colleagues!

I was promised to have a bank transfer 8 weeks ago and I am still waiting can’t even get through to tui on phone now really frustrated
Was told I would get a refund in four weeks that was up last Tuesday no money has appeared as yet I have tried phoning bang on 9 when the lines open can’t even get through not even on hold just get told lines busy phone back later. I took two and a half hours on hold to get the original refund approved is making me very nervous. Was due to travel 8th of April emailed but just got reply saying they will answer in 28 days.
"It depends who you get through to on the phone. I had been waiting since 21st March for a refund that was supposed to happen within 4 weeks but did not. I started calling at week 5 and could not get an answer as to when I would get a refund. So I left it. I then on 7th May decided to call again and kept calling and speaking to different people and eventually got thought to someone who processed b refund immediately. Money should be in my account next week due the bank holiday.Edited: 9:22 am, May 09, 2020 "
Yes I got a full refund on the 6th May for my cancelled cruise in April. I never expected it I can tell you!
"We are in the same situation our holiday was cancelled on the 18th March due to travel on the 22nd. and w e accepted the full refund and was told we would receive it within 7 to 10 working days, now 2 months on still no refund cannot get through on the phone and have tied at least 6 different numbers also various EMAIL sent just keep saying refer to the web siteWe always book with TUI as we believed they were the best, NOT SO SURE NOW. AS we paid by credit card we have put it into their hands now to try an get t sorted."
"We have been waiting for a refund for a cruise since I’d. Arch when they said money would be in Bank in 5-10 working days. The cruise should have taken place on 14th April, not heard anything since. This is absolutely disgusting. They have had our mo ey for over a year now."
We received email cancellation by tui on 14.5.20 it states your holiday has been cancelled by us do not contact as refund will be paid automatically. We waited 10 day went to our local tui shop they run my bank card though there machine said will the bout 20 day b4 in my account. Here we are 12th of may and still no monies. I've spoken by phone to them twice and assured my cliam will be pay ASAP Rubbish!! Looks like solicitor nx step.
"Hi I am awaiting a refund from TUI, should have travelled on the 26th March, have an email from the 30th March confirming refund. Spoke to TUI on the 24th April they said it would be in the Bank that night still nothing and you cannot get through.They have broken even their own T&C's there is also rumours that funds from the UK have been transferred to their German parent company to support their operation!Hope when we do get our money back it is with interest"
"I will be taking TUI to court to get my money back. I feel we have not been treated right , we should have had our money back in March, but unable to get through to them at all. Now feel they are not bothered once they have your money. If it is right that they are putting our money into Germany to help them it is outrageous and should be challenged."
"@ Post 119 from Robert - what you say (""We received email cancellation by tui on 14.5.20 it states your holiday has been cancelled by us do not contact as refund will be paid automatically. We waited 10 day went to our local tui shop they run my bank card though there machine said will the bout 20 day b4 in my account..."") is physically impossible as you are talking about 14 May 2020 as if it is in the past , but it is only 10 May today On top of that inaccuracy, Tui shops have all been closed since the lockdown started so you cannot have gone into one 19 days after 14 May (again a date in the future ! What are the correct dates please?@ Maria - you do know I take it that Tui is a German owned company!Edited: 3:47 pm, May 10, 2020 "
Hi Read this with great interest as we were due to travel on a Cruise with Tui on 27th March . I booked through a Tui Store and on 22nd March they rang me and arranged the Cancellation and refund that day. I was informed that it would take 7/10 days for the money to hit our Bank account. 7 Weeks on and I still have not received any money from Tui. I feel that they are acting disgracefully as they take your money well in advance of your Holiday but they seem unwilling to refund you in a reasonable time. I have telephoned continually only to be cut off by their pre-recorded message telling me that they are getting a high volume of calls - no wonder when they are treating their customers this way. Unfortunately we have another booked with them for this coming weekend so it looks as though we will have to go through the same thing to get a refund for this Holiday as well.
"Well if there was any doubt Tui were trying hard NOT to refund customers my recent experiences have convinced me that they are not even trying. I, after many attempts have got past the messages saying that they are not taking the call because of the volume of calls or the unobtainable tone, 3 times. Twice I was told I was through to the wrong department( after long holds) and today after holding for 25 minutes I got the ringing tone to be put through to an advisor when I was just cut off! Needless to say I won't be using Tui after this. It is too often to be inadvertent and I think it is their policy."
"Been ringing TUI all morning, message on phone saying more than normal calls so can’t take my call try later. Kept trying the line is now closed, but ring another number that gave me, rang that number more calls than normal so can’t take my call. I will never book with TUI again."
"I have been waiting for my refund since the 20th March and not heard anything from them, have tried calling but always engaged can anyone advise pleaseJulie"
"Dont bother with TUI, just go for section 75 claim if you paid even a part of the holiday/flights on a credit card. Its far faster. I have had 2 airline claims paid out within 3 weeks."
"They lie, I was due for 2 weeks in the Maldives on the 15th April, they issued a cancellation notice on 21st March saying I would have a refund within 4 weeks (abta rules are 14 days, but given coronavirus 4 weeks ok) however after 4 weeks, nothing. Called - told another 2 weeks, called again after 2 weeks, told by one of their supervisors that the rules no longer apply to them. Getting through to them was a nightmare, keep getting recorded messages saying they are unable to cope with call volumes, have been cut off by their support staff on a number of occasions"
No...I cant even contact them as they are not picking up.. I'm now in the process of issuing court proceedings and filing tomorrow.. over six weeks trying to phone and Email..
Thats my take on it too.
Got a voucher but cannot get an answer from tui for a refund. They never answer phone
"I cancelled my holiday more than 6 weeks ago as I couldn’t wait for them to get round to ‘contacting me’ and confirming I wouldn’t be going to Italy on the 8th of June - of course I wouldn’t be. So yes I chose to forgo my deposit, had an email to say I’d be refunded within 20 days. Rang them after 26 days (after waiting over an hour on hold - that’s after I had to redial a bazillion times just to get past there ‘I’m sorry we cannot take your call as we are really busy’ message. As per their website, despite their new offering of a ‘refund credit’ anyone who has been promised a refund before this announcement would still revive it. Was told I would get my refund on the 1st of May and would get an email saying it was done. Rang them again (same ridiculous farce to get through) and was told plans have changed, I now also had to have a ‘refund credit’ applied to my account, despite having waited over 6 weeks already and then once I had my refund credit email I could ring them up (lol) and request my refund. I was in tears on the phone, couldn’t understand why the goal posts kept moving, but I still had to jump through more hoops to get my refund. I got my ‘refund credit’ email today, spent 2.5 hours trying to get through (not even on hold, just to get into the hold queue) and eventually was told I will have my refund in 3-5 working days. Obviously feeling doubtful and drained I asked if I would get an email to confirm the refund was actually processed, was told yes will come through in about 10 mins - that was nearly 3 hours ago.....I haven’t even yet managed to digest how I feel about Tui yet but I know it’s not good."
"Has anyone got a credible customer services email address for TUI ? the online form is rubbish as they do not acknowledge or reply. The phone number rarely gets through and when you do its the usual so so busy please later and yesterday it was disconnected. Posting on facebook help page is totally ignored as the only pick whom to answer. I know they are our largest tour company but seriously so many disgusted customers they are not to big to go, Thomas Crook was huge as well. Is ther any credible options out there ? Tui owe me £5k Love holidays £2.6K Eurostar/ maastricht hotel £2.5K and that one looks very unlickely"
"After numerous phone calls i got threw & requested a refund i had email said it could take 1 month then had an email yesturday saying i have been refunded back to card i paid on & checked my bank & they havent refunded, there email says they owe me 0 now but my money is not in my account"
I was promised a refund on March 21st within 7-10 days.It arrived in my bank today May 12th so just be patient. TUI may be tardy in getting our money back but they will get there. The more people who ring and hassle them the less time they can spend on processing the payments.Good luck
"""The more people who ring and hassle them the less time they can spend on processing the payments.""Wise words, shoney44.I'm not yet in the position where TUI have cancelled my holiday - I'm scheduled to depart on 12th June, the day after they've cancelled up to.But I've not been in touch with them - as requested by them not to do so.And I won't be trying to contact them the second the do announce my holiday is cancelled.This information posted on another forum may be of use:<<Through the conversations I have had I now have a better idea of why things are all over the shop, and this should explain a few of the mixed experiences of refund timescales: 1. The phone teams can only refund card payments, and only where the card used is still valid (i.e. not expired), these refunds are pretty quick (2 days for the card element of one of my holidays)2. The only people that can action the following payments are the Finance team:Direct debit Payments Card payments where the card has expiredPaypal paymentsThis is where the bottleneck is, likely due to staff numbers, system access when working from home (data security etc.) and that each transaction is likely more lengthy than the ""click button"" card refund.This workload is likely why you won't get timescales out of TUI on outstanding refunds as they just don't know how long it will take to clear this queue of work.>>"
Update to earlier message - I got a voucher by email yesterday which I had already told them I didn’t want - they said on 21st March I would get cash refund. After battling with their phones again I got through to a lady called June who said unfortunately due to a computer issue at their end they can’t process my refund and it has to go to “financial control”
"my wife was due to travel on 2nd april . holiday was booked at a tui store,just before the stores closed we were contacted by the store and my wife requested a refund and we were asked for our bank details ( the holiday was paid for on credit card ) .we waited and on the 5th of may decided to contact tui ,we got through ( it took an hour and 10 minutes) and were told the booking was in the hands of the finance dept . today the refund was put back into our account. the timeline from requesting a refund to getting it back was around 2 month so if anyone has been waiting any longer its worth getting in touch to give them a reminder.. please bear in mind that the person you speak to will be just as upset as you about this whole ordeal so there is no point of ranting and raving at them.Edited: 6:14 am, May 12, 2020 "
"After weeks of waiting for our credit note to arrive by email and endlessly trying to get connected to a call waiting system at tui customer services we finally made it. We then waited 1 hour and 40 minutes before we were connected to a customer services rep to discuss a cash refund. Our refund was authorised within ten minutes and we received an email notification of this. Our refund had then to be processed by the tui finance department. Our deposit was refunded to our bank within three days. I had paid an additional £72 for seat allocation. That too has been refunded within three days, however, the balance of our account has NOT yet been refunded which is worrying. We are hoping that this will appear in our account this week or it will be yet another call to tui to find out why that has not been paid back to us."
"After spending weeks endlessly phoning tui and not being able to get on their call waiting system without them hanging up I finally managed to get in a queue. 1 hour and 40 minutes later a customer services rep answered the call. Within 2 or 3 minutes our full cash refund had been authorised and ten minutes later we received an email confirming this. 3 days later the deposit and additional extras (seat allocation etc...) had been paid back but alas no sign of the balance. We are hoping we don't end up having to try and phone them again as it is extremely stressful and time consuming. Goodness knows why they have paid us back like this. Has anyone else had this experience, and did you receive your balance eventually?Edited: 9:50 am, May 12, 2020 "
I have had a refund from Tui for my cancelled holiday due to the Covid virus but they haven’t refunded my deposit
They will probably refund I the deposits separately. I’d give it a couple of days or so and see if you have it by then.
I have had a refund but not my deposit
Has anyone who paid by direct debit received a refund yet?Thank you
"I have, it arrived 5 days after travel date even though was advised it coukd take 28 days after travel date."
TUI received financial help from German govt. At the same time TUI informed hotels with TUI contracts that payment will be delayed indefinitely. Hotels get normally paid 3 -6 weeks AFTER TUI guest checkout. This tells you something about TUI.
Yes. We have received a FUL refund for a Marella cruise booked from 1-15 APR with our local Tui Shop so would presume they are working through the list of customers affected !
Yes. We received a FULL refund for a MARELLA Cruise booked through our local Tui Shop. We were due to travel on 1 Apr for 15 days. We had an email to tell us that the holiday was cancelled and that a refund would be given once the passengers affected were identified and that this refund would be given on a date due to travel basis. These are extraordinary times so I would suggest a bit of patience as Tui are obviously working hard to get refunds out.
"@ footprints ""..Hotels get normally paid 3 -6 weeks AFTER TUI guest checkout. This tells you something about TUI...."" I am not exactly sure what you mean by that as it is STANDARD practice in the travel industry for tour operators to pay hotels etc AFTER package guests leave not before or on arrival . this is the way they and other operators have done things for years .The way you have written what you have implies that Tui were playing a fast one whereas it is the way all such contracts are written . This ""post departure date "" payment in arrears issue was one of the problems that hit the headlines when Thomas Cook folded - hotels which were already still waiting for payment for guests who had recently returned home were providing bed and board for current guests who were staying in rooms which the hotel had not been paid for by TC and had not a cat in hells chance of receiving money from TC for either. In the initial crazy days of that crisis there were some holidaymakers who were being asked ( incorrectly I might add but it happened) to pay the bill themselves in order to be allowed to stay there until the end of their holiday because hoteliers were so anxious about not being out of pocket whilst waiting to hear whether the ATOL/ABTA scheme arrangements would cover the payments for stranded guests or not"
I forgot to say that we had paid for our cruise IN FULL by credit card so there was no deposit involved which makes a refund easier and. It’s likely. We have always paid for our holidays IN FULL at one transaction for this exact reason. Refunds are made much easier.
"What is the best time to ring Tui,try 9am they are busy,try 6.45 pm busy. Ring 7pm closed.☹️☹️"
"I doubt there is a ""best time"" - more a matter of ringing and ringing until you get through I suspect"
"We were promised a full refund on a cancelled cruise in the Caribbean, due to start 26th April.We have had no contact in 15 working days and none of the contact mediums are responding.So to be fair honest and honest, I literally have no idea what is happening or if there is any intention to honour the refund. But the fact they are not contacting customers, doesn't look good. Very frustrating.This issue will give cause for thought for any future holiday bookings."
"Yeah just keep dialling, it took me a total of 6 hours over 2 days. However after actually talking to someone and promised a full refund. I have had no further contact, I have not been able to contact TUI?I've been waiting 3 weeks since my initial promise of a refund.Good luck."
"MenorcaRegular@149. This is why I have little sympathy with the travel companies,they take in millions of pounds from customers and then hold on to the money for months before they have to pay out. I paid nearly £5000 two days before everything was shut down and I was assured by the lady in the Tui shop that if it was cancelled I would get my money back within 14 days GUARANTEED.I wish I had recorded the conversation."
"Hi in answer to the questions. We were promised a full refund from TUI on March 25th for aq holiday to FloridaWe were due to go APRIL 15th, However , after numerous emails to their customer service they stated yesterday we would get a refund but they have no idea when!! This is no use at all as quite alot of money involved because there was our family of 10 going! We feel we have been extremely patient and now are thinking of taking it up withATOL! Its all very worrying , we have always been loyal customers to Tui but will think twice abiut booking with them again after the treatment weve received! Very dissatisfied customer"
I for one have not had a refund. I can’t even get through on the phone and as my phone logs calls I’m currently at nearly 300 times I’ve tried to call them. It’s absolutely disgusting
Did you get a refund in the end ?
"Hi. Managed to speak to TUI on Monday after over 100 calls! Received refund this morning, which is absolutely brilliant!! Was very sceptical about whether I would receive it at all, even after being told it would take up to 10 days. Can’t complain about my experience! Lise"
"Holiday cancelled 02 June. No refund credit email received which they made out is required to apply for cash refund. However, it does say on their website you can apply without this.Tried calling failed, tried calling failed you get the picture. But when I selected the option on the phone to book a new holiday I then got placed on hold. I figured no one would be booking holidays in the current state of affairs so the operators must just be dealing with refunds. After 39 minutes I got through and I was correct, the lady was not aware of the option I had selected.She was lovely, holiday is cancelled and I should receive my full cash refund in 7 working days. I will of course update it this does not happen.I hope this helps for people in the same situation!"
"Cautious optimism! I got through again and selected options 2,2,and 1 (not sure if they make any difference) and after 35 minutes was through to a person who afer advising me that I could have a voucher said a refund back to my credit cards was no problem and would be done in about 7 working days. I was due to fly on 31st of May so had not received a voucher code. Obviously I will check and report back."
"we should be going away on 22nd MAY we had a email from TUI the voucher code to wait 28days from 22nd May to either amend or refund we want a refund and have tried to contact them with no luck 1 hour wait at a price per minute a joke so still no news only to wait 28 days .We have also paid for our other Holiday in July so we would have amended one holiday and a refund for the other now im not sure i ever want to go with TUI again so sad for us all to be treated this way ,TUI WAS QUICK TO TAKE THE MONEY OFF US ."
"I booked a holiday via my travel agent for a Tui package holiday for May 7th 2020. I was informed by my travel agent on the 7th April that my holiday had been cancelled, I requested on the same day that I wished to apply for a refund, I did this as it stated on the Tui website that if a full refund was requested by the customer before Tui had a chance to offer me a credit note they would try and complete the requested money refund. However then I was told that Tui would only be offering credit notes and a 20% incentive on top to re book it for a later date. I can confirm that at no point did my travel agent or I get any communication from Tui until last week where my travel agent was informed that they were going to release a payment system. My travel agent who has been amazing emailed me to say that she would check on Monday this week , I then got a call this morning stating that I had my money refunded back to me for the full amount , as promised my travel transferred that across to me today and it's now in my account. I am over the moon of course but wanted to share this as it was a complete shock after not hearing anything since April. Not sure how it works when booked in a Tui travel agents but looking like there is some hope out there for some. Aware that my travel agent did complete a monkey survey when I requested my money back, perhaps this helped in some way too."
I booked through a Tui travel agent but it’s now closed.
Got a refund email with ref. no yesterday. Spent time looking for replacement flight in May 2021 (all more expensive than this year!!) Tried to book online and .......guess what......refund ref. no rejected as not valid!!Tried many times today to get through to TUI to see why refund ref rejected but just get message to try later.
"As above, have you tried going through new bookings."
"Do you have an email address that i can request a refund for our cancelled holiday please, tryinyig to get through on the phone is pointless! many thanks"
"See this post from TUI on social media, they are unable to process refunds via email. You’ll just need keep trying to call them. https:/…"
no refund been waiting 7 weeks was due to fly in march not happy with them
The same here. 17/3/2020 TUI spoke to us and said that they had processed my refund and we still have not received anything. How long are we expected to wait?
"https:/…coronavirus-faqsThey are running behind""Unfortunately, it’s going to take a bit longer than we planned for us to send you your refund credit. Our team have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to get our systems ready for you, but we’re not going to be able to meet the deadline we set. We’re really sorry, and appreciate how frustrating this must be. We can assure you that we are in the final stages of testing and your refund credit will be with you soon. """
Yeah I had that email today saying I’ve been refunded but check my bank and not been paid.. keep us updated. Hopefully just takes a couple days to process!
Forgot to add that having phoned on numerous occasions (The number on the Martin lewis website) I finally got through to be told that because I booked in store rather than online they can’t do do thing for the refund (Which was agreed on the 17th of march but still not paid) and I would have to wait until the stores opened.. that was even from the supervisor. Has anyone had a refund if they booked via a TUI Store. I am very disappointed with the way TUI have just abandoned us.
"Holiday 24th April. Cancelled by Tui 8th April. I paid deposit by credit card and balance by direct debit. Had the deposit refunded the day I phoned 24th April, but not the direct debit payments. Told a few days...be added to spreadsheet to be dealt with by Finance Dept. Told I would receive a cancellation invoice.Heard nothing 3 weeks later..no invoice. No direct debit refund."
"Tui was meant to put my refund in my account on 18th March still haven't got it there a disgrace, blocked all emails and phone numbers for tried them today again"
I was due to travel on 17th April. I requested a refund and received an email confirming the funds would be on the card I paid with inside 4 weeks. I have just received an email with a voucher for tui credit! I will be phoning to clarify as soon as. Surely they are obliged to refund me after confirming this with an email?!
"Hi I have been trying to contact TUI For weeks. I have Emailed written, no reply or acknowledgement from them.As for telephone, they either keep you hanging on for hours, or hang up on you.I am convinced we will never see that money again. We have travelled with TUI many times never again.Has anyone any other ideasANNE MAC"
"I waited for my refund voucher to arrive as requested by Tui. However, I have been unable to get through on the phone number they have given out for refunds. 816 attempts to get through on my phone. All you get is 'we're busier than normal, please call back'. Why can't they just put a form online to enable us to claim?Absolute disgrace.Also the offer of a 20% extra on the credit voucher is a scam. I priced up my holiday for next year. Wouldn't you know, It's 20% dearer!!"
"I booked in a Tui store (never again you can't access ""manage my booking"") and paid in full around Christmas to travel on April 4th. Was rung on 20th March and asked if I wanted a voucher or a refund. Obviously I said refund and the lady said ""that's all done now and you should get it in 30 days because we are so busy"" I also received a cancellation notice clearly stating I would be receiving a full refund of £4762. I finally received my refund on Tuesday 12 May, so not too bad but a very anxious wait. My issue is that I did not receive a full refund, £100 has been deducted and I have no idea why. It may seem a bit petty and a small amount compared with the cost of the holiday, but £100 is £100. I have tried to contact them, but as we all know this is practically impossible. Has this happened to anyone else?"
"I received a refund from tui yesterday... 8weeks after holiday was cancelled. Haven’t received full refund, £800 short. Anyone else had this?"
I was due to fly 2nd April told by the tui on 21 March the cash refund would be in my bank within 14 days still nothing. They even took my bank details. All you get are automated messages when you do get through saying every thing is done in date order that is a downright lie. Some people(very few) have had refunds for holidays after this date. Can anybody who has had a refund please tell me the phone number they used. Thanks
"It does also state on this notice that once your credit voucher code e mail has been rec'd by you (for those that get an e mail) if you still want the fund as cash instead,then contact them."
"We ahve been trying to conact Tui for the last week or so on 0203 451 2868, however, everytime we call, we receive an automated message advising due to the amount of calls they are receiving they are unable to take our call and to 'try again later'. Getting worried that due to the job losses at Tui that we will never get our money back."
I was told on the 14th april that my refund would be processed on that day still heard nothing or had anything tried ringing hundreds of times cant get through disgusting!!!!
I have been waiting over 2 months so I made a complaint with the company Resolver. TUI did send me an email explaining it would be longer to get my refund due to the way their staff are working.... that was 4 weeks ago and still nothing has been paid!
"I've read that that TUI UK callcentre in normal times would receive around 20,000 calls a day. It's currently receiving 300,000.So no wonder people are having problems getting through.Jet2 website states ""Sorry, we're not taking any calls"". Whether they are accepting emails (TUI isn't) instead, who knows..."
"Everyone I know who has tried phoning tui has had Call Busy come up on phone , or if it rings and you get through to the automated line , it then takes you to 3 x options / questions , then rings again and you think you have got through to someone, Only for it to ring for 5 to 6 seconds, then you are told lines are busy call back later !!!! And so it repeats itself over and over ! Until after hours of this you just give up trying , which is of course why they are making people phone for refunds as opposed to an online system, as you use when booking , as you would have a record of this when filling in the online form , and it would show how long the refund would take . Our useless government does nothing about this flagrant breach of when the repayments should be made , as if people haven’t got enough stress in their lives at the moment."
We booked a road trip across the US as a golden wedding present to us both we saved hard and paid TUI £4000 in February they cancelled our holiday and we have heard nothing from them since thenWe have made over 40 phone calls to numbers give and never got through just the recorded message.TUI now need to come clean and tell us when we will get a full refund TUI you have acted very badly not allowing Any contact .Customer service does not exist spread the word do not use TUI in a very difficult time for us all they have let many people down Just get in touch with people
"I have tried many times to get to speak to someone. They arent even honest about their opening hours. I am thinking about legal action, Im sure there are enough people in the same boat to make class action viable."
"I have had the same experience as everyone else, phoned countless times no response.Isn't it time we contacted an MP who could fight on behalf and put pressure on ABTA to do the right thing and pay out all the money everyone is entitled to."
"Persistence is the answer...We should have flown to Costa Adeje on Sunday May 10th, but as it was cancelled we received a Refund Credit voucher on Monday 11th (not 4 weeks from departure date as originally stated).As we wanted a refund, I tried several times yesterday and heard the 'We are very busy, call back later' message. So today I decided to give a more concerted effort, with the TUI phone number on speed dial.At first I got repeats of the 'busy' message, but then I got through to the main switchboard with the 'press 2' etc instructions, which also ended up with the 'too busy' message several times. Then suddenly it changed to another ring tone and I was placed in a queue, with the information that it could take an hour to get through to a person.In the event, it was 1 hour 45 minutes before I was eventually connected to an agent, who agreed to refund our money to the bank account it was paid from within 5 working days.We will see what happens next week, if it arrives as promised I will post here to confirm.DavidEdited: 1:01 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"What a despicable way to treat your customers! I've been trying every day to get a refund since the 21st of April using the phone number they advise. I have now received a refund code with the instruction to ring the telephone number I've been trying since April! What on earth are they playing at! If they can email you with a refund code, why can't they give you a dedicated email address or phone number where you can apply for the refund. TUI are only interested in trying to get future bookings from the refund vouchers. I for one will think twice before booking with them again. I'm going to try ATOL, Credit Card Company and my MP."
I'm the same but when you try to phone them about a refund you can't get through. They say they are very busy try later and cut you off. This has happened to me nearly 2 months..
"It's impossible to get a refund from Tui - I have my refund credit note but what ever time I call, the line is just disconnected 'we are experiencing a high volume of calls'"
"As follow up to my post of yesterday......Perhaps a ray of hope for others.This morning I armed myself with about 6 TUI phone numbers. For a couple of hours I was getting either engaged signal or message saying ""Sorry...we're getting more calls than usual and to try later""from all numbers . Occasionally got a message starting ""Hello .....you're through to TUI"" and was asked to select a couple of options.....and told I'd be put through to an advisor.....but then the ""Sorry"" message again and cut off! Then , this afternoon about 2pm I got a different message saying I was in a queue but answer time could be over an hour!! Well having got that far I wasn't giving up and was determined to wait for the first available advisor. Almost two hours of mind numbing messages later I finally got a live person!! By this time I was almost spitting feathers.....(but was determined to be civil). My advisor (Corrie) with a soft Welsh accent turned out to be extremely helpful and competently worked his way through my problem with no fuss. I explained that we had received our credit number and email two days ago and after some online searching had selected a replacement flight for this time next year. I told him I had tried a few times to book that online but each time when I was asked to enter the refund ref.no. I got a message stating ""Not a valid refund ref."" He apologized for that and said he would try to book it for me and see what happens. He got to the same point and the system refused the ref. no. (although he agreed it WAS valid according to their records. Having sought advice from a colleague (possibly a manager who could override the system) and put me on hold. After a couple of minutes of music....the worst happened .....the line went dead!!My blood pressure began to rise as I thought of the time it had taken to get this far.....could it all be for nothing! I needn't have worried.....Corrie phoned me on my mobile (from their previuos records) and informed me that all had gone well and told me the new booking ref. (and took payment for the difference in price of course.....) So what I'm saying is......what could have been a heated conversation ending in a cash refund demand turned out well on both sides. (as long as TUI manage to survive the year). To others here ......please keep trying to contact them. The advisor confirmed he was working from home (which probably means he doesn't have all of the office facilities. He kept calm throughout. Praise where it's due.TUI are lucky to have him! Number I eventually got through on was 0203 451 2695.Good luck!"
"Having had a bad experience with TUI 2 years ago when a flight was 9 hours late taking off and them not wanting to accept reponsibility I had to take my claim to arbitration and in the end TUI had to pay up 800 euro's after loosing the case against them.You would have thought I would have learnt a lesson from that but no, I had a TUI holiday booked and paid for in March this year for Tenerife when COVID19 struck.I canceled the holiday with a 90% TUI cancelation fee but that did leave me with a 10% refund and with the Air Passenger Duty refund it gave me a total refund of £157.76 but after 12 weeks trying to get the refund all I have managed to get is a offer of £31.76 so now I have a Deadlock Letter to take to Arbitration once again. I really think I am lucky by comparison with a lot of people because I stand to loose less than most but the one that will loose the most is TUI for treating it's customers so badly, look at the Trustpilot feedback for TUI.co.uk and TUIholidays.ie it's really BAD!"
I was due to travel 2/05/2020 cancelled my TUI .. booked with Hays travel money refunded today . We’ll done Hays travel
"Guess my daughter must have been lucky today as she phoned TUI in her lunch break today whilst at work and she said she was only on hold for 8 minutes, asked where her refund for a cancelled holiday was as she had been waiting since March for her promised refund and the refund was back in her account by the time she got home at 5pm as she checked her bank account due the woman she spoke to saying it would be in her account from the card details she had previously given them within the next few hours. Don't know if it was so quick due to both both TUI and my daughter banking with Barclays.Angie."
"Raymond no I don't think so, she can fight her own battles without dropping names.....lolAngie."
"What is email address for tui? I have used few, but have come back as not delivered. HELP."
If you're wanting to send an email in regards to a refund then they won't respond. They have stated on social media the only way to contact them about refunds and cancellations is via telephone.
Hi we were travelling in May & same thing unable to talk to anyone or leave a message - disgusting behaviour - when I was late with a payment they were very quick to bombard me with emails & phone calls. Very interesting how’s there’s a rule for them & a different one for us customers!!!
"Simply disgraceful - This company is in serious difficulties and will not be able to payout. Ringing for 2 weeks now - I DO NOT WANT ""REFUND CREDIT"" as its worthless when they go bust. I WANT MY REFUND in CASH as do the hundreds of thousands of other TUI customers. Wise Up TUI and give us our money back, its no your money as you have not fulfilled you side of the contract. You had no problem hounding us for payments by bombarding us to get paid. ABTA and ATOL need to step up and let people know what to do next."
Recieved a full refund today. Holiday to Jamaica cancelled on the 16th March 2020 so it's taken some time but got it in the end. I think patience is needed!!
Yes finally after 2 hours on hold got through full refund given.
was due to travel on the 26th of April but have still not had a word from TUI they have enough branches to be able to let a manager work in the branch to get in touch with customers this travel company just seem as they do not care about there customers or they would keep in contact with them.
Said I would update. Called on Wednesday 13th May and after the customery 30 odd minute wait got through and promised full refund. Checked credit card today and it had been refunded. Credit card company say the refund will be in my account on Monday. Cannot check the deposit is back as I paid it on a different card and they are not answering the phone but I am hopeful.
Not a penny so far despite numerous deadlines and promises.Our holiday was cancelled on 12th March so their claims of processing refunds in date order don’t wash with us.If TUI fail as a company it’ll be due to the appalling way they’ve treated the very people they’ve relied on for their previous successes.
Cancelled our holiday on 24th March and was told our refund would be given within 4 weeks. Nothing has happened and I can find no way of getting in touch with them. Had flights with Jet 2 and refund came in 4 days.
"Update to my post #192 yesterday:My persistence on the phone has born fruit, as the refund was credited to the bank account this morning! The only downside is that the total of 18 landline calls over two days cost a total of £25, but at least it achieved the desired result."
I book on cc now after Thomas cook saga..not even heard from tui.told Barclays and they have sorted it just a deposit to get now that was on debit card..there stalling payments in hope to keep it for future booking..not me they cant get to me with any form of call email that's bad as my holiday has been gone now lol
Will fail no trust ..not there fault what happened but communicating is
"Hi. Had holiday with TUI cancelled, due to fly 24th April 2020. Credit refund note arrived by email on 12th May. On 13th May I got on phone at 9AM and kept pressing redial and at 9.45 got through and was put in a queue. At 9.55 spoke to a TUI operator and they agreed to a refund of the full price of the holiday. was told it could take up to 14 working days for money to arrive in our bank account. Checked account on 15th May and the refund was in the bank in the morning of that date. Seems a lot of people are having problems, guess I must have got lucky. Many thanks to TUI. Hope they get through these uncertain times."
Update to post 211.Checked with the second credit card company and the deposit had been made so all monies refunded. I. M. O. the problem is the ridiculous method of contact ie. spend hours trying to get through. If they did it online and paid in date order people would be prepared to wait a reasonable time. I hope Tui survive because I have been a satisfied customer in the past and we need travel companies in the future but if they treat customers badly I fear the worst for them.
"Martin Lewis has stated very clearly ""Voucher code not ATOL, Credit or Debit Card Protected"""
"If you don't mind me asking ""what number did you use to contact TUI""?"
"I’ve been waiting 5 weeks for a refund, the email said I would receive a full refund in 4 weeks. I managed to get through to speak to someone who said it is taking longer to process refunds to customers who paid direct debit???! Anyone else have this issue?"
We had our holiday cancelled on the 17th of March. They agreed a refund and issued a refund note. Then nothing. Countless emails and telephone calls resulted in no response from TUI. Yesterday with no call or email I received a full refund back into my bank. I am very relived. Good luck everyone.
"""Martin Lewis has stated very clearly ""Voucher code not ATOL, Credit or Debit Card Protected""@ Linda LWhere and when did Martin Lewis say this?"
tried to contact today and guess what....cant contact by phone at weekends.DISGUSTING. i had transferred payments to another pre booked holiday. full amount not transferred and no refund for remainder as promised. i honesstly believed them hence good review a few weeksago.
"Like Paula C (Post 223 above ) I too am interested in the source of the statement you made in Post 219 LindaThe following is a full copy and paste of the text on MoneySavingExpert website I have just read regarding ""refund credit vouchers"" ( as opposed to standard credit vouchers which are not the same thing) :-""..Right now, some holiday firms are issuing a special kind of voucher called a 'refund credit note'. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says refund credit notes, which are issued if an ATOL-protected flight-only booking or package holiday has been cancelled, will likely offer ATOL insolvency protection. That means if you take the voucher and the firm goes bust, you should get a full refund.This is a new form of protection introduced for the pandemic, so the Civil Aviation Authority – which runs the ATOL scheme – says it's NOT been tested and isn't 100% guaranteed, but there's a chance you'll have more protection than you'd usually get with vouchers. So if you're offered a voucher, it's worth checking if it's a refund credit note and if that gives you ATOL cover....""As always, the devil is in the detail"
"The website I refer to above also says the following specifically in relation to Tui packages (a copy and pasted extract of website info as at todays date) :-""...Tui . Trips up until 11 June 2020 are cancelled. Tui says if your holiday can no longer go ahead as planned, you'll receive a refund credit for the full value of your holiday, and a separate booking incentive of up to 20%. You can then ring if you want a refund instead..."" ."
"And there's information on the TUI website about refund credits and vouchers.So if anyone has information that currently contradicts those 2 sources, please post links.Don't just post unsubstantiated statements.As for this:""guess what....cant contact by phone at weekends.""@ carol4mickIt clearly states on TUI website that phone lines are open Monday to Friday."
"I am still waiting refund and after phoning numerous times for over 3 hours I got through and was first told because we were flying with easyJet they have to speak to them first even though it was booked as a package in store. They did phone back at the end of the day and said because we were going to the lakes we had to talk to their specialist team who are dealing with that but to still call back on the same number. Why she couldn’t have put me through at the beginning I told know. I think they are just fobbing people off and making up their own rules. Always used Tui, but never again"
This refund by original method is an out and out lie. I had my holiday cancelled 18th March refund done in store 19th March confirmation email of cancellation and refund on 22nd March should have travelled 23rd March and nothing since.. I paid cash in store so asked or cas refund.. Denied.. I asked for it to be put on my card.. Denied would only do it through BACS with sort code and account number.. 9 weeks on still waiting told April 25th not refunded told 1st May not refunded then 15th May not refunded.. Total lies all along. Was sent time line of refunds from Wellingborough brach.. All dates been and gone yet people after my date of departure in April May and June have been refunded.. Date order is a lie..
I reveived 2 emails from TUI one promising me a refund/credit by 2 May for my Cancelled holiday. Then on the 2nd of May another one from Andrew Flintham CEO assuring me that I would hve this by the 15th of May. It has not happened. I have had no contact since the 2nd of May from TUI and No refund or Credit. I have tried phoning the number on the web site and have been cut off or left ringing until it cuts out. This is a fact and so yes Paula C - the information may be there on the web site but that does not mean it actually helps!
"@AllyintheusaIf you read my post again, I was referring specifically to refund credits/vouchers.I was not talking about the emails you have received.I've read the information on the TUI website about receiving a refund credit and what a customer can do after receiving that refund credit.So when TUI cancel my holiday due to depart on 12th June (so far holidays departing on or before 11th June) I know exactly what to expect and what I'm going to do with the refund credit.So you may not have found the information on the website helpful, but I have."
Due to fly out 7th of June Holiday cancelled 29th of April Waiting patiently for refund credit ( not wanted) no sign yet.
"We have received a credit note but not cash refund as requested by us. We have rang the number provide by tui almost non stop for 4 hours for the last few days . Unfortunately there is a recorded massage to say"" we due to volume of calls we are unable to take your call. Please ring later"". This disgraceful. We will call barclaycard on Monday and find out where we stand"
We are due to fly to Turkey with TUI on 14th June. So when would you expect to hear that they have again extended their cancellation period? We certainly do not want to go.
No refund yet. Many calls over many days. Same recorded message then hang up.
"no holiday cancelled 18th march instore refund processed 19th March confirmation email for cancellation and refund but nothing yet. they gave a date 25th April then 1st May then 15th May all have passed and nothing.. it was an instore booking and paid in cash and cash refund denied even though they say refund by original method refused refund on my card but would only do it by BACS sort code and account number.. in store booking seem to be pushed d to the back of the queue and being ignored and disregarded in favour of credit card, online bookings and through pay pal.. I also read that the German side of TUI were being paid out at the UK's expense.. can anyone verify that>"
"We had a holiday booked for July, we decided to cancel it ourselves in store and lose our deposit just before the lockdown in March, to date no refund has been received, trying to get hold of them via phone is hopeless with well over an hour on hold to then be told a refund SHOULD be received by the end of this month... mmmmmm not convinced!"
"@ VickiIf YOU cancelled in March, I guess you would only have paid the deposit (based on the fact that the balance for our mid June holiday was due on 20th March).You say you would lose the deposit.So what refund are you waiting for? @grahamspencercWhere did you read that the German side of TUI were being paid out at the UK's expense?"
We had our holiday cancelled on 16.3.20. We where due on a weeks cruise and a week in Jamaica for our 40th wedding anniversary. They told us they would refund us in 3 to 4 weeks. We are still waiting after three phone calls to them and being told it will be the end of the week as the are having problems with PayPal. We have asked the credit card company for a charge back today.
"I had been going in weekly to make payments so our holiday was almost paid in full by the time I canceled, they put 5he refund request through in store to be paid by bacs however on my last phone call last week they said it hadn't been looked at yet but should be refunded by the end of this month, if it isn't I'm to call again to escalate"
"We should have flown to Italy on the 01-05-2020 but have yet to hear ANYTHING, I want to book for next year but TUI are seemingly less than keen to offer us anything (even vouchers haven't been offered yet). I can see them going the same way a Thomas Cook due to the disgraceful way they are treating their customers.Edited: 1:50 pm, May 16, 2020 "
VickiAh. I understand.Let's hope that TUI will have got on top of all the refunds by the end of the month so that the people who have been waiting for refunds get their money back.
Yes my daughter got a refund after 5 days of getting in touch with tui the holiday was booked for 21st may 2020 took 2 hours to get through but she just put it on speaker.Shes very happy with their response.
"Have tried phoning emailing direct messaging and nothing holiday booked and paid for instore..cancelled 18th March refund done in store 19th March confirmation email of cancellation and refund on 22nd March and should have travelled 23rd March.. Going on 10 weeks now and nothing.. Saying refunding by original method.. Lies.. Saying refunding by date order lies.. Nothing but lies or a wall of silence.Edited: 9:05 am, May 17, 2020 "
The whole hiday was paid instore in full. So I'm waiting going on 10 weeks for any sort of contact from TUI. Holiday cancelled 18th march refund done in store 19th March confirmation email of cancellation and refund on 22nd March and nothing since should have travelled 23rd March.. So no your wrong by stating just deposit.. I read it on this trip advosor about TUI paying German customers first at the UK's expense.. But I guess its been removed like my comments on their home Facebook page coz they blocked me on there too.
TUI CANCELLED the holiday not me so full refund is due.
Same.
I told them some home truths about lying to customers about refund time line dates and instore bookings and refunds being pushed to the back of 5he queue. I was given 3 dates for my full cash refund April 25th 1dt May and 15th May... All have passed and not a penny refunded.. Lie upon lie..
"Try the numbers in this faq, which is specially for in-store bookings:https:/…store-booking-faqsJust keep dialing until you get through, it worked for me, refunded the next day."
No we have not. We booked a flight out to Tenerife with JET2 on Friday 17 April and a flight back with TUI a week later on 24 April. JET2 were brilliant. Money returned and in in our bank account. TUI are just playing games making a credit note easy and a refund as near to impossible as they can. Moral of the story. In future book only with the reputable firm JET2.
@paula c. my booking clearly states open 7 days for contact. hence whyi used that info and not website
"Had mine 5 days after my travel date. Rang and had it allocated against another booking. Excellent service for me as usual. The 28 days is only an average timing, they will all be dealt with, I'm sure they are doing the very best they can working from home."
no
Don’t worry about options as you will never ever get through to them to request the refund. Disgusting service.
"@ carol4mickI guess between you booking and you now trying to get in touch with TUI, a little thing called COVID-19 came along and changed a lot of things in the world.Pubs, restaurants, shops are closed. Travel is limited - domestic and international.Did you really expect TUI to be running their business in exactly the same way as pre-COVID because that' what it said on your booking?Edited: 3:06 am, May 18, 2020 "
no not yet but to get in touch with them is impossible Mostly engaged but when it does ring out after pressing two selections they then tell you they are busy and cant take your call and to ring back. Been trying for a week to get my refund. I would imagine if you want to rebook you will get through. Disappointed so far
"Pam - in the current climate a week is nothing - please note Paula C's comments above in Post 256 and be prepared for the long haul . Have you tried using the website info for an inital foray into the ""cancelled trip"" process ? At least using that you enable you to make screen-prints as evidence of when (and how often) you have tried to resolve your particular problem"
"BTW - the inference on the current pages of Tui's website is that if your holiday is cancelled they will contact you with your options anyway. If your holiday has not officially been cancelled yet you can transfer your booking to something else - not what you want if you prefer a refund of course, but until the trip is ""officially"" cancelled (that is normally pretty close to departure date) that may very well be all you can take - see https:/…coronavirus https://www.tui.co.uk/destinations/info/refu…I currently have a package booked with another provider departing next month but THAT has not been official cancelled yet and I am therefore having to play the waiting game until I receive the ""your holiday has been cancelled"" message and I will then start the process of getting a refund - it is annoying to have to wait when you are as sure as you can be that the flight will happen and the destination is not accepting foreigners yet but as my granny said "" patience is a virtue""Edited: 5:57 am, May 18, 2020 "
"""I currently have a package booked with another provider departing next month but THAT has not been official cancelled yet and I am therefore having to play the waiting game until I receive the ""your holiday has been cancelled"" message and I will then start the process of getting a refund - it is annoying to have to wait when you are as sure as you can be that the flight will happen and the destination is not accepting foreigners yet but as my granny said "" patience is a virtue""""@MenoraRegularI'm in exactly the same position.TUI have cancelled all holidays up to and including the date immediately before my departure date (12th June).I've been reading stuff on here, on the TA Greek board and other websites.I've been checking what TUI are saying on their own website.I know that getting in touch with TUI is very difficult.I know what times they say their lines are open.I know what numbers they've given out.I know what my options are.I know that I will have to do my best to get in touch with TUI when my time comes. Just like your granny - I will have to practice patience and perseverance.Nobody has a magic wand to get you to the front of the TUI call queue."
Finger crossed it all works out for us both Paula - I fly on 2 June and Love Holidays are currently only cancelling packages up to 22 May but I already know that Easyjet are now only offering flights to my destination from the beginning of July so the one I am booked onto is likely to be officially cancelled 7 day before departure date and the trip will self destruct then!
"Our flights for 20/03 were cancelled on 15/03, and I was contacted by phone on 18/03 with an offer of a voucher but they accepted my request for a cash refund. That's 9 weeks during which I've been understanding about the exceptional circumstances, but no communication from them and no way of getting through apart from Twitter where you are fobbed off. It's more complicated by having booked via lastminute. They have emailed and made various offers to which I asked for a cash refund, despite them charging admin costs, bu they are waiting for Tui. I'm expecting Tui, when they eventually get around to it, to make me jump through the offers of vouchers again despite having done that already on 18/03!I also paid Tui direct for seat bookings but can't see anyway of applying for this. I understand their plight but closing phone lines so that you can't even wait for an hour or two is appalling."
"Alan GMaybe it's the sheer number of calls they are getting on top of having to organise staff working from home.I read somewhere that they usually get 20,00 calls but are handling around 300,000.Some people seem to get through and request a refund and get the refund straight away.Others seem to have been promised refunds by various deadlines that have come and gone without a refund.I think it may depend on how you originally paid.Paypal payments seem to be taking longer.I don't think TUI have handled this very well but I'm being pragmatic.Until my holiday is actually cancelled, I don't think it's a good financial decision (for me) to try to get in touch with TUI.I'd lose my deposit so I'm hanging on for the refund credit which I'll maybe decide to use for next year's holiday. Or request a refund at that point, depending how things are looking."
"Thanks Paula C.I really do understand their predicament but we know that poor communications make it worse.I managed to get through to lastminute and they put my claim through to Tui 4 weeks ago without reply.I just can't get my head around the fact that unless no claims have been processed at all, which I know isn't true, how my claim which I'm assuming was in the very first tranche (the first holiday and flight cancellations were on the 14th and 15th of March) is still waiting. Probably because it's through a 3rd party agency.The voucher offer just doesn't work for us as the flights were for 7 people and that's not going to be possible to rearrange.Thanks for your reply. Patience is a virtue!"
No got a refund code and spent £50 on the phone trying to speak someone I will never use this company ägain
"scooby18365What was/is your departure date?Have you read the info on the TUI website which says you'll get your refund credit in a ""separate email four weeks from your original departure date with all the relevant information"". I take this to mean 4 weeks AFTER your departure date.You can then contact (ha ha) TUI to say you want a full refund.Where are you in that timescale?"
"We had an email about 3 weeks before departure date saying that the holiday was cancelled and that we would receive another email with the Refund Credit 'within four weeks of the departure date'.In the event, the second email with the Refund Credit code arrived the day after our departure date and we managed to get through to a TUI agent 3 days later to arrange a refund, after about 3 hours on the phone.The money appeared in our bank account the next morning, so no complaints here really.Alan G:Your issue is with Lastminute since you booked with them, not direct with TUI. If they won't pay up, your best option would be with your credit card or bank (through Section 75 or chargeback) to get your money refunded.Edited: 12:13 pm, May 18, 2020 "
I managed to get through to First Choice/Tui on the day my refund credit came through. I asked for a full refund of £2945 and was told that it would be processed and done within 7 days. Last Wednesday I received £327 and nothing since! Has anyone else had this happen? Is that the norm?
"Did you pay via DDM/instalments? It says on TUI website: ""As you paid for your holiday in instalments, we have to refund each instalment separately. We're sorry about this but all monies will be repaid. """
tried today same message.saying busy call back later can not speak to any one . I have a code for refund credit but I would like my money back'Jackie
what number did you ring please
no one is getting the phone
I did pay instalments. Hopefully I’ll get the rest in the not too distant future!
‭020 3451 2868‬I hope you manage to get through tomorrow!
"Same here: 0203 451 2868.Program the number into your phone and keep dialing until you get 'Welcome to TUI and First Choice...' then go through the menu pressing buttons 1 or 2 as appropriate. This may take you to the same 'We are very busy, try later' message again, but if you keep trying you should eventually get placed in a queue with repeating messages saying 'All our agents are busy, please hold and we will connect you as soon as possible'.It is painful but is the only way as it stands to get a refund.Edited: 2:37 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Hi, I did try from 2 weeks time to call them, no answer. Today 18.05.2020 all day I did call them, afternoon around 4pm I got in a queue on hold for 3 hours and nobody answer to me. That call will cost me £16. So I need to try call them tomorrow again."
I cancelled Myself in March I have yet to receive any refund I rang them I was on hold for nearly 2 hours they said I would receive it within 14 days still waiting
"So you cancelled the holiday yourself so you have lost at least your deposit , possibly more depending on the cancellation clause situation . I hope that the holiday isn't one of those now being automatically cancelled with full reimbursement due or you will be miffed that you jumped the gun."
I know see what happens it’s really frustrating
"Having been sent a refund credit from Tui which I wasn't interested in, I raised a section 75 claim with my bank two weeks after they cancelled my holiday, as I paid for the holiday by CC. Santander then sent me the required forms with which to make the claim and I returned the required information on the same day. Less than a week later, the full amount of the cost of the holiday was returned to my CC account by Tui. That wouldn't have happened if I had tried to deal with Tui direct, as that is almost impossible to contact them by phone. My bank made sure that Tui obeyed the law, which states that Tui should have refunded me within 14 days of cancelling our holiday, regardless of their reason for doing so.I have always paid for my holidays by CC, just in case something like this happened and thank goodness I did, as it has saved a lot of strife."
"If you paid by CC, contact your CC company and raise a section 75 action. If you do that and follow their instructions, you will get your cash returned to your CC account within 2-3 weeks of starting the process. It's very easy to do but make sure you have all your documentation to hand."
Been waiting since 13 March had that many fairy tales that TUI puts Hands Chfistian Anderson to shame. And dont get me started on ABTA
"I telephoned them 72 times over 2 days, I kept being told to call back later. Eventually I got through and told I would have to wait at least an hour before I could speak to an agent, due to call volume. I waited 2hrs and 9 minutes before I spoke to someone and finally got my refund. Be prepared to hang on for ages,if you do you will get some joy."
"Just an update, the rest of my holiday refund was in my account this morning. I received £327 last week, then the rest as a lump sum today, rather than instalments. The whole thing took 7 days so no complaints from me. I hope everyone that’s struggling manages to get sorted soon!"
"There is now more information on the TUI website about timescales for refunds.it explains why some refunds have been taking longer.It explains why some people haven't (yet) been refunded the full amount they've paid.There is no magic method to get you to the front of the TUI call queue.Nor is there a magic number for you to call that nobody else knows about.It seems very 'hit and miss' how long it takes to get in touch.I read on another forum yesterday that it took someone just over 30 minutes to ring, get though and have a refund approved.Other people seem to spend hours on the phone and still can't get through."
@paula cthe details were on my amended booking end of april !!! I AM AWARE OF COVID 19.I only made a comment and stated my situation.i am leaving this thread.
@carol4mickI didn't realise you just wanted a rant.I wouldn't have bothered replying if I had realised that.I'm just gob-smacked that given the circumstances - that you are aware of - anyone would not bother to check out the company website instead of relying on paperwork received a couple of weeks earlier. Given the very fluid situation that you are aware of.
"Hello, I was wondering if you had received your refund via paypal yet? The amount paid on the debit card came back straight away to me (maybe the day after the phonecall) but I am still waiting for the paypal refund. Did TUI give you any guidance on this?Many Thanks in advance,"
"Hi Jess, you need to say who you are asking.Have you looked at the TUI website?As per my reply #285 they have information on different payment types on there.it depends on your departure date, I think."
"Hi My 6th June holiday was cancelled by TUI n the 29th April. They are saying that I should receive a Refund Credit note within 30 days of the departure date. Does anyone know whether ""Within"" means 30 days before or 30 days after?"
"Hi everyboody,I am now in a queue about 25 mins. I did tired today from 9 am to call. I am currious if will success today or not."
"""I am currious if will success today or not.""---Who knows? We certainly can't answer."
"I’ve had a voucher code for a flight that was due out on the 28/4/20 I’ve tried contacting TUI on the telephone number given for cash refund instead, but I’m having no joy getting through.I’ve tried at least three time a day for the past few weeks, but I’m told they are very busy, then the call is terminated.Come TUI get it together!"
"I am still in the queue on hold 1:25 minEdited: 7:43 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Likewise, dialled 100 times this morning and eventually got into the ""queue"" (I hope its a queue) - Currently sitting at 1 hour 40 mins wait time and counting....."
"@ AlbertThe way I read it is sometime after your departure date but no more than 30 days after,"
I am now with one adviser after 1:40mins on hold.
"@X666SUN:'Trying three times a day' is unlikely to get you through to an active line.You have to sit with the phone and continuously call with the number programmed into the phone so you don't have to keep entering it every time. Each time you get 'We are very busy, try again later' hang up and immediately dial again, until you get 'Welcome to TUI and First Choice' when you will get a menu of options, which if you are lucky, will take you to the queue waiting for a person to answer. Just keep trying and you will eventually succeed, like myself and others on this forum.Edited: 8:10 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Sorted, 14 days till have to arrive the refund to my bank account. I hope will be no any delays."
"Thanks Paula. ""Within 30 days"" is a tad vague and could mean before or after. Looking at other comments on the forum I will just have to wait."
"Good luck with that. We were promised a refund to PayPal 14 days ago and our refund credit was cancelled. Now over two weeks on and no refund , surprise surprise. We can not get through on the phone line so are in no man's land. We have booked holidays with Tui for years but never again."
Incidentally our booked holiday was March 31st
"""Thanks Paula. ""Within 30 days"" is a tad vague and could mean before or after. Looking at other comments on the forum I will just have to wait.""Albert;I guess one could be cynical and say that it's TUI's intention to be vague...;0)How did you read it?I have this fun & games to come as my TUI holiday is for 12th June and am expecting them to cancel anytime soon."
"I just wanted to give a bit of hope to everyone struggling to get a refund from TUI. We had a week's holiday, originally booked online, in Lanzarote departing on 7th April and decided to wait for the refund credit email before phoning, as per the request on TUI's website. Received the refund credit on Monday 11th May and 144 attempts later got through to talk to someone on Wednesday 13th May. At the end of our polite conversation, I was told the refund would be credited to my Mastercard in 7 to 14 days. Having just checked online today, the refund was actually received on 13th May, the day I spoke to them. Maybe I got lucky as I know from reading this thread that a lot of people have not had refunds issued when promised. For me, the process was a tedious one but my message would be to persist and be nice when you do eventually get through. ...good luck everyone!"
"@ Paula C:You are right, it does mean within 28 days after your departure date, although ours arrived the day after our departure date.We are also waiting for the next cancellation tranche to be announced, as our next one is June 15th. If they are true to form, they will announce the next dates two weeks before the current period end, which by my calculation is May 28th.Good luck everyone in getting your refunds!Edited: 1:51 pm, May 19, 2020 "
Has anyone rebooked using the 20%. I'm wondering if you get the online discount and the 20% or just one of them. Thanks in advance
"@ Millar,According to the Ts&Cs of the Booking Incentive, it can't be used in combination with any other discount:https://www.tui.co.uk/destinations/info/refu…Edited: 6:46 am, May 20, 2020 "
Thank you for the reply David. Cheers
"After calling numerous times and getting through and adding what wanted( a refund), adding what was required re the booking to be told sorry we are extremely busy telephone later.Is this costing me each time I phone and they answer .Does anyone know who to complain to as it is frustrating trying to get through for a refund."

We have received a full refund. We spent 4 1/2 hours on the phone. A very competent lady sorted all the appropriate paperwork within 6 minutes and we received our refund within 4 days.
"Update on post 4th MayDue to travel 22nd March. Have now been mislead by Tui 3 times on refund date. Last missed date 11th May so have now raised claim via Paypal.Guess might take even longer now but hopefully PayPal will reimburse nearly 10k.The Tui management in charge of the refund process are a moral disgrace, although I sympathize with those working the phone lines."
I had easter bank holiday booked and saw it was cancelled by TUI booked back in March around 8th I still have not received any refund on my credit card.PF.
I've received a refund for one holiday 15th Apr whole amount but a 2nd holiday we had booked 10th may they only refunded me 1 payment as this was direct debit £240 X 7 only got 1 installment so far trying ring to find out why ? So be another 6 hrs to get threw not good ! But yes I've had a refund to answer your question but you need the refund code
"Had a credit note over a week ago but would like a refund instead .just impossible to get through after hours of waiting and many many calls ,why don’t they do it via e mail or calling customers in departure date order .we should have had our holiday by now .we have travelled with TUI countless times and surely this behaviour is illegal ,I don’t honestly know how they are getting ahead with it"
"We had our holiday to salou Spain cancelled via email(even though we knew it would be cancelled) the email stated We’d receive a credit voucher For the amount we’d paid + 20% in the form of an email but if we wanted a cash refund we would have to wait for the credit voucher then phone TUI on 0203 451 2868.I phoned straight away anyway... I was on hold for 20 minutes or so then spoke to someone, it was a terrible line, sounded like they were out in the wilds with wind in the back ground, they hung up on me!!!I phoned again, was on hold for another 20 minutes then got through to someone else, this was a terrible line too but fortunately the lady I spoke to was determined to help me,I explained how now that myself and my wife had been furloughed that money was tight and I would need a cash refund ASAP, she agreed, took a few details and said I’d get the refund in up to 28 days paid back into my bank account.I received an email 5 minutes after speaking to her confirming the payment and stating it could take up to 28 days. I wait with baited breath for the money going into my account..."
"Like you our cruise 19th April cancelled. We have had balance refunded as this was by debit card, but our deposit was by PayPal and still not refunded. Also our excursions paid by debit card not refunded. We've raised complaint with PayPal. Fed up as can't get through to TUI."
"Tried to get through after receiving my cancellation number but it's impossible not enough staff to answer. Why don't TUI get all their furloughed back to work to answer the phones, the system is in place but they don't want to give you your money back."
Perhaps they can't get all their staff back in because they cannot maintain social distancing. Perhaps some of their staff are sick or self isolating with symptoms of coronavirus.I know there's a lot of people who want things to be normal again but hat's not going to happen for a good while yet.
"Have rung the refund number over 50 times. Sometimes it is engaged, sometimes you get through to the menu. You are then told they can't take your call due to volume of calls and to ring back later! This is such sharp practice! It's amazing how efficient they are when it comes to taking your money for a holiday booking but cannot organise a refund. Have travelled with TUI (and before that Thomson) for decades. They are treating clients appallingly."
"I received my refund voucher last Friday for a holiday booked for 25th May departure. I called TUI on 3 numbers from 3.30pm on Monday and like everyone else, got the same engaged tone / recorded message saying they couldn't answer the call and then the hang up. I eventually made it into the 'queue' at 5.30pm. They shut at 7.00pm. By 7.30pm, I was still in the queue and then eventually they must have flicked the switch to turn the phones off as they were closed as I was just cut off. Very annoying.I called again on Tuesday from 9.00am, got in the 'queue at 9.30am and then managed to speak to a human being at 11.30am. Quick call, refund all agreed. I paid in 3 parts, so the refund was to be actioned in 3 parts within 3-5 days. The man I spoke to did cut me off whilst processing the 3rd part of the refund but he called me straight back to confirm it had all been done. I paid by credit card; checked my account and the refund had been credited the same day.I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I know it is frustating not being able to get through on the phone and they should have better mesaures in place to handle these requests but the simple fact is they don't and this isn't going to change.My advice is to keep at it. It may take a while but you will get there in the end! The numbers I called were 020 3451 2688 / 020 3451 2695 / 020 3451 2868 (in case anyone needs them - all the same so no one number is better to ring than the others)Good Luck!"
"Breaking news ,just looked on Tui website and you can now request refund on line if you paid on line and you have your refund code."
"That is good news, although it took a bit of searching to find it. Here's the link to the refund request page:https:/…pre-travelHopefully the requests will be actioned promptly."
I have been pet refunded holiday was £3000 and they’ve sent me back £1335 anyone no why ?
Corey.Look on the TUI website.There are a number of scenarios that are explained.The reason for your part refund may be included in that information.
We have now received our refund for our holiday in May .we also had to pay for our August holiday I just hope we don't have to go all through that again.but they were optimistic that we will be going so fingers crossed.
"Has anyone actually used the credit voucher on the TUI website. I was willing to accept the voucher but when I look to book online the promised credit voucher is not being deducted from my final balance. I don't want to book, pay the deposit then discover that they are not honouring the voucher. Anyone else had this problem??"
"If you read the section 'How do I use my refund voucher to make a new booking' in the Tui coronavirus faqs you will see how to do it:https:/…coronavirus-faqsEdited: 10:51 am, May 21, 2020 "
Finally received my refund today! It's only 9 weeks late. Never booking with them again after this.
"We still haven't had a refund credit note yet despite Tui stating on their website that it would be within 28 days, we were due to fly to Costa Rica in the 20th April! We managed to get through on the phone today, our first time phoning as well, to be told that they will not issue a refund until we have our credit note code, despite us telling them we had been waiting 28 days, it was still no. How did other people manage when their holidays were in May? They have now apparently changed their policy from today and you can apply for a refund online, but you will still need to have your credit note code! Looks like more waiting then ....."
I was scheduled for a flight on the 12th and was told the same as you; I am yet to receive my voucher; have you had anything yet? I’ve tried calling and emailing but can’t get through to anyone?
"TUI have this afternoon issued a statement with an apology and given a link to follow to request a refund online. You will need your credit voucher number to do this and so if not yet issued, then you'll not be able to follow this new process but at least it might reduce the call traffic."
"I've had the email about applying to get a cash refund online but I can't find anyway online for requesting this,I booked with first choice but I thought it would just be the same as direct with tui. I wish it was more black and white,I hate all this uncertainty"
"I have got a email from TUI about my refund again ,i have been informed you can fill in a form online ,no form on line does anyone know about this thanks"
"In the email you received, if you go to the but that's days coronavirus information, outlined in blue, and press on that, it will take you to the information and the form, but you need your refund credit code to use the form, until then it won't work."
"Here is the link to the online refund request page:https:/…pre-travelIt is a bit tricky to find and it could take upto four weeks to get your refund, but it saves time on the phone."
I finally got past the first robot and put on hold for 1h 53m 54s. Talked to a very nice person and got a full refund posed to my credit card in two days.
"I can confirm if you go to the Coronavirus update, and the go down to Would I like a refund click the link fill in the form you will get a confirmation tick and we will just have to wait and see what happens.Better that 2.5 hours on the phone."
My cruise was for 20th March. It. Word and no refund although confirmed 17Mar .Just cheating by sending out general emails?Has anyone got a refund for a March cruiseDR
"Yes, we got a refund today, 2 days after I was on hold for almost 3 hours! I was told refund would take between 7 to 14 days so happy with that.I would use the link they have said to use now, save a frustrating call."
"I had someone ring today but as i was down my garden i didn't answer,so they left a message saying that they were trying to refund me! I had rang them back in April, the lady on the other end had cancelled it for me because they had sent me the e-tickets for a holiday that had obviously been cancelled! The message basically told me ring on the 0800 number which says that it closed and to ring another number! I even tried pretending that I was going to make a payment on a holiday just to get through to someone! So still no refund and not sure if I'm going to get a credit voucher code because i said back in April that I wanted refund! (This was before tui was doing credit vouchers!!!"
"@ David R and @ debbiedavisHave you looked on the TUI website?There are all sorts of scenarios there - holidays/cruises, booked online/paid in store, booked by different payment methods - and details of where they are refund-wise. Have you had your refund credit code?As previously mentioned, if you have you can apply for a refund online.Debbie - it also mentions where they are having problems with refunds - expired cards etc.Maybe you fit into one of those categories and that was why they needed to speak to you.Very unfortunate that you were unable to take the call."
"Just an update for anyone who applied for a refund . My holiday was scheduled for 8th April to Cyprus. TUI agreed to refund my holiday on 19th March.After reading about the issues people have had contacting Tui I decided to sit it out until I could get into the shop and chase it up.As the weeks have gone by I became resigned to perhaps having to settle for a credit note in lieu.Well to my surprise the full amount turned up in my account yesterday, so anyone else waiting my message is do not give up , they do appear to be working their way through the chaos"
I will never use TUI again... it's not their fault this has happened but the way they have responded is nothing short of gross negligence and demonstrates all they care about is money. I still havnt had an official email conforming my holiday wont go ahead which was meant to be 5 days afo
"There are articles in the news today, saying Tui have sent emails out apologising and admitting they got it wrong and have updated and simplified their systems to enable you to request a refund on line, don't know how true it is."
"""There are articles in the news today, saying Tui have sent emails out apologising and admitting they got it wrong and have updated and simplified their systems to enable you to request a refund on line, don't know how true it is.""It IS true.I have received the email.BUT...as per my earlier post this morning, you can only request a refund online if you have received your refund credit code."
"Our Tui flight was booked for 20th March. We were promised a refund firstly by email within 10 days, then through countless phone calls (often hour of waiting) advisor said within 4 weeks and most recently 8 weeks later the advisor said should be paid within 6 weeks; today is week 9 and no refund !! None of their staff seems to know whats happening and the hour phone waits are frustrating when they can't process a simple refund themselves; they have read and agreed my information, know it's me and told me my last 4 digits of my credit card used so what's the problem??Absolutely disgusting service. I have also got a cruise booked and unfortunately, fully paid for it, I also want this cancelled but don't see it happening. Tui are holding their customers money in their bank, obviously getting interest on it, whilst in these trying times their customers suffer financially.I will never book with this company again; customers are not high on their list of priority."
"Here's a copy of what's in the apology email:""As we continue to navigate this period of ongoing uncertainty and start to think about how we can prepare for the future, I’d like to send my thoughts and well wishes to you and those you care about and hope that everyone is keeping well.It’s hard to believe that in a matter of just months, we've gone from taking our customers on holiday all around the world, to being forced to cancel holidays for nearly a million customers.It’s certainly been a learning curve for us, and I’ll be the first to admit we didn’t always get it right. I’d like to apologise for the frustration you may have felt. I’d like to assure you that we’re dedicated to doing everything we can to make things better.Following a lot of customer feedback, we’ve completed a thorough review of how we’re looking after you and what improvements we need to make. We’ve developed a new system that will allow you to manage cancelled and future bookings and have created a simpler online process should you wish to request a cash refund, removing the need to call us to do this. We will continue to offer a refund credit first, as this ensures that your booking remains ATOL protected should you wish to change it to another time. We’ve updated our Coronavirus section on the website so you can find lots of additional information, as some process may differ slightly if you booked online or in a retail store.We also know that many of you like to go into our TUI Stores where our advisors can support with every element of your booking, or simply answer your questions. We’re therefore constantly adding Travel Advisors to our home working team whilst our stores remain closed. Rest assured, these team members are doing everything they can to help you as quickly as possible - so please bear with them. You can call them on 0203 451 2688 between 9am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.I’m confident that all of these improvements we’ve made will save you time and provide you with the reassurance you need to start looking forward to travelling again. We’re certainly excited and ready to take you on holiday as soon as we’re able to do so.Again, I’d like to apologise that things have taken longer than they should have, we will make sure that we’re better in the future.Stay safe,Andrew FlinthamManaging Director""I had a phone call from them on 21st March saying a refund would be sent in 7-10 days, then was told it would be the 1st of May but now it's the 27th May. If they'd only said when they first called that they were having problems refunding due to x,y,z reasons and it would take up to 12 weeks I think their customers would have been happier. People don't like false promises and are understandably worrying where their refunds are."
"We had two holidays booked through TUI. One that was supposed to leave yesterday for a week and another for August. We cancelled one and rebooked another and had no problem with getting our refund. It took some time on hold, nearly seven hours and I wish that was an exaggeration but as soon as they processed the refund the money was back on my card a week later. The second holiday we rebooked using their 20% extra offer and booked a vacation for next year.I'm guessing we were lucky as we sorted this out towards the beginning of the pandemic but I do have to say the staff on the phone are doing their best it's just a shame the company made some bad policy decisions that now seem to have been rectified."
"Our holiday was booked for the 6th June. Given the latest info received by Tui, am I allowed to ring for a refund or do I have to wait until I get the credit note? We’ve got another holiday booked for later in the year so just want our money back for this one. Not even tried to make any phone calls yet with still working and not having time."
"The advice has been for a while to wait for your email with the credit note and then follow the instructions on that.I'm guessing here, but after the announcement yesterday there may also be a link in the email to claim a refund online."
"<< I'm guessing here, but after the announcement yesterday there may also be a link in the email to claim a refund online. >>Yes there is a link on TUI website which takes you to the refund claim form once you have the credit code.https:/…pre-travelAngie."
"Slightly off subject...I have a holiday booked for 22nd June, which will inevitably be cancelled. It is to Greece, who have categorically stated that international travel will not happen before 1st July.I was therefore surprised that TUI announced yesterday, an extension to the free amendment clause to include all holidays up to 31st August. They did not however extend the cancellation programme past 11th June. Surely this will massively increase pressure on their amendment/refund resources.I therefore decided not to wait for a refund/cancellation...instead to amend to 2021. I looked for a comparable holiday at a comparable price . I found the same holiday, albeit for an earlier 17th May departure. This earlier date was necessary to price-match without asking for any discount.It was however offered by First Choice. This I made clear at the start of my phone call...indeed it was the reason I couldn't effect the amendment on-line. After 40 minutes on the phone confirming all the details, I was informed it was not possible for the system to switch from TUI to First Choice at the amendment stage....but I could do the switch after my TUI holiday is cancelled and I have the subsequent credit note, which I can then apply to First Choice. I may, at that stage, even be entitled to my 'good-will' discount. I wanted to re-book the same flights/accommodation, and for less favourable dates, at an identical price. This was to secure my holiday whilst availability was possible. Simples...? You'd think so....So...I guess I now have to join the queue.....Frustrated......"
"Moving between different companies isn't usually allowed.I'm not sure how you expected them to be able to amend a booking on the booking system of one company and it to be able to appear on the booking system of another company. The only way to do it is to cancel the original booking from the TUI system , rebook on the First Choice system, and then apply any credits or discounts. If the original booking hasn't been cancelled by TUI then normal charges would apply. It's also a time consuming process and those aren't something travel companies don't have time for a the moment. Can't you book with First Choice now, pay deposit to secure the booking and then apply future credits when your original booking is cancelled?"
"It doesn't seem simples to me, sorry Simon. I'd describe finding the exact same flights and hotels, for the same price as challenging to be honest, even if offered by exactly the same company."
My holiday on the 14th March never even got a texts from tui to say flights had been cancelled we phoned Birmingham airport and they told us even thou I've phoned and emailed tui not heard anything back from them yet people I know that booked online have had refunds we booked in the shop so it says it all x
I can understand Simon's frustration as First Choice are part of the TUI group but if computer says No.......
AlanNo refund or a credit voucher yet and my holiday was due for the 23rd of March I think this is disgraceful
"Thanks for the replies/comments. TUI and First Choice are, of course, the same company, and they are facilitating interaction on re-bookings and incentives. Both, it would appear, only subsequent to cancellation. They even have the same help-line number. The person on the help-line was surprised that the change could not be made at this, the amendment, stage! I will eventually be able to use the TUI refund credit as payment for First Choice.Post 357....You may have mis-read my post. I had indeed found the self-same (identical in all respects other than date) holiday, and it was on that basis that I was making the switch. I thought that would work for them...Never mind...I will wait for my TUI cancellation , my subsequent TUI Credit Refund, my TUI Booking Incentive which I will then apply to First Choice accordingly. All dependent upon prices being comparable to this year's paid price of course.Hey-ho..."

"I sent a letter of precaution by courier, it was received at their head office today.Hopefully they will respond within the time allowed or money claim online is the next step.Very disappointing."
"I should have been on a TUI cruise starting 8 April. I can't reschedule so asked at once for a refund £3000+. They are ignoring all requests, fobbing me off with the stock ""they're working on refunds from the beginning of April right now."" I've now found out that they now need the new expiry date for my credit card (ran out end of April). But now I can't get anyone to take my new expiry date.It is just one delay after another. In desperation, yesterday, I tried Emailing TUI's Press liaison officer. Perhaps if they worry about bad publicity, something might happen."
"<< TUI and First Choice are, of course, the same company, and they are facilitating interaction on re-bookings and incentives. >>They are sister companies (same parent) and share resources but they trade separately. The two brands are kept separate hence why amendments across brands can't be done (or done easily) with live bookings."
Just got a refund although I didn’t want ne wanted too pay my holiday in December I was on the phone waiting for four hours and twenty min no sorry for the wait when. Asked the operator if I could pay my other holiday he said it take too long better I take the refund I asked will I lose my 20 percent off he said no and guess what he lied he refunded my credit card I have 2 more holidays with Thomson’s and if cancelled won’t be using them again waited two weeks too actually get through I left them for a few weeks after receiving my credit note too make more helpful for them I understand it’s hard but being reasonable got me no where and out off pocket
"After my post this morning, I received the credit refund email from Tui tonight when our holiday is due to travel on 6th June. Applied for a refund using the new link on the website. See how long it takes to come through."
"I have opted for a cash refund not the credit. I had to fill in a form online and quote my booking reference. I got a reply saying it will take up to 4 weeks to process but in the notes it says ""As a reminder, if you have not provided your Refund Credit code we will be unable to process your refund."" Yet there is nowhere on the refund form to quote this code, I checked twice. I think they are stalling."
"I've read several posts on another forum that say they have managed to request a refund online.Here's one:""My departure date was 18th April and I received my RCN about 10 days ago. Having read about the difficulties of reaching Tui by phone I didn’t even bother trying to call them. I received the email about claiming a refund online and completed the form easily, received confirmation from them and I too am awaiting my refund.""and this from the same person:""I have filled in the same form without any difficulties. Once I put in the holiday reference number, lead passenger and departure date, my details popped up and I then put in the RCN code. All very simple and I received an email confirmation that it had been received.i booked the original holiday online so if your wife is using the correct information I wonder if she booked in a store?""So no problem with quoting the RCN code.Maybe try again."
Nope. My friend is the lead passenger and has tried calling them Friday for the code to claim our refund. She got through after hour and half to be told they would call her back and didn't! I'm disgusted with how they are treating people. We are entitled to our money back yet they aren't forthcoming it getting it sorted. As anyone else got their code from Tui please ?
Thank you for that info at the bottom re the bank. I will call my bank Tuesday and see if they can help.
"""As anyone else got their code from Tui please ?""@ TeresaWhat is your departure date?TUI say they will send an email with refund credit code 4 weeks after your departure date."
"I have received my voucher code, applied online for refund and received an acknowledgment email. My departure date was 11th May. Before being able to apply online, I had made over 50 unsuccessful attempts to phone TUI, texted them, written to their registered office pointing out (among other things) that they had made it totally impossible to contact them. I hope they keep their word that the refund should come through within 4 weeks. Watch this space......."
"Holiday was cancelled 9th April by TUI managed to speak to someone on the 9th April, was told full refund would be processed within 4 weeks and had email to that affect. Rang up last week and was told all refunds would be processed by the 27th May as it stated on website. Checked this morning on the website and it’s now changed to 1st June. Let’s see if I get a refund by 1st June........"
"We were meant to be going on holiday may 22 ,had a email saying it was cancelled in April ,that was the last and only contact I’ve had from tui abut my holiday ,I’ve requested cash refund not voucher but says on web site you have to wait for a credit code before you can request a cash refund .STILL WAITING"
"No we haven’t had ours yet and no contact from tui ,tried calling but can’t get to talk to anyone ,I understand they must be very busy but a email would be nice .Hope you get your sorted soon"
TUI/Sovereign cancelled our holiday on 24th March. We refused to accept anything other than a full refund and were eventually informed via email on 29th March that the full amount would be refunded to our credit card within 14 days. We appreciated that TUI were very busy so did not hassle them. After 3 weeks we were told it would be 30 - 60 days. Last week we were told it would be 'prioritised' and done within the week. Today it is 9 weeks since our holiday was cancelled and still no refund. We are initiating the charge back process with our credit card provider today.
"My family were due to fly on 4th April on a First Choice holiday booked in a TUI store (not online). Holiday cancelled by TUI prior to that (around mid-March). I waited until after the travel date (as instructed) but heard nothing. I kept checking back on the website and waited for TUI to contact me (as the website said). I tried phoning at one point but was left on hold for exactly 2 hours (honestly) before the call was disconnected! I therefore continued to wait for TUI to contact me until I saw a post from Martin Lewis with a number to ring (020 34512868) which I did... many, many times. Sometimes there was just a beep and I got cut off, sometimes I got the engaged tone, sometimes I got through 2 option menus to hear the recorded message that they were experiencing a high volume of calls and that nobody could take my call. However, I keep trying and eventually got through (12th May) and, after a 48 minute call, I was told that my refund request would be processed (even though I'd never had an email with a credit note/code). I'm still waiting for my money to be refunded to my bank though... Has anyone actually had the refund that they've been promised? Does anyone know the expected wait time to receive the refund?"
"We had an email about 3 weeks before the May 10th departure date saying that the holiday was cancelled and that we would receive another email with the Refund Credit 'within four weeks of the departure date'.In the event, the second email with the Refund Credit code arrived the day after our departure date and we managed to get through to a TUI agent 3 days later to arrange a refund, after about 3 hours on the phone. The money appeared in our bank account the next morning.Our holiday was booked online, though...apparently refunds are taking longer for in-store bookings, since TUI don't have records of the credit or debit card used. I don't think you get a refund credit email either.In those cases, I think you need to contact TUI to give them your bank account details for a BACS transfer.Edited: 8:15 am, May 26, 2020 "
As I had booked my holiday in store I provided TUI with my bank details when I finally got through on 12th May but I still have not had my refund (now 2 weeks later).
i have been fighting for my flight money from this horrid company atol does not count because they are still trading so you cant claim on that charge back don't want to know either bc its atol protected im at my wits end just keep getting told to get advice from others who send me to others its a vicious circle no one wants to help im so run down over this
"Update on post 20th May.PayPal have closed claim against TUI in my favour and refunded full payment for holiday due to depart 20th March. Lo and behold receipt for refund arrived shortly thereafter from Tui. Amazing how they can act when they have to.So for me it's thank you to Paypal and farewell to Tui, period."
"Hi, We were due to travel to Florida on 1st April obviously this didn’t happen. We’d included Disney and Universal tickets for the eight of us too. TUI refunded all on 1st May. It was returned to my cc as a series of four payments (deposit, top up deposit and two equal payments) all at the same time. Card refunds take 7 to 10 days to appear. I cancelled our summer holiday on Friday and my refund is showing as pending presently. I did book another hol for next July but decided to do so separately. Hopefully your monies have landed by now."
"having tied to get in touch with TUI for the last 20 days with no success as yet they keep you on hold for a good 55 mins and then cut you off so you try again you are not able to get through< i received a e-mail to say that I could have a refund they got the cash amount right but never mentioned the vouchers that we had used off them for bad service that we had on a previous cruise. At the moment in time I do not feel like I shall be trusting them enough to any more travel with them, I think we are both willing to loss the £1105.00 that we received in vouchers from them.It is quite possible they will still not be trading next year."
We have been waiting since march they cancelled ours on the 13thmarch and still waiting we phoning the shop and they say that there waiting for tui to process it
"We were due to fly on 23 April having booked in a Tui store and paid for our package on 3 Feb 2020. The holiday was cancelled mid-March and we were told that Tui would contact us proactively to issue us with a Credit Note Refund. On receipt of this we could claim a cash refund but we would have to await the Credit Note Refund and then quote the code number of the refund on our request for a cash refund. To date we still have not received the Credit Note Refund. After many phone calls and being placed on hold for almost two hours on several days I finally got through to speak to an adviser on 22 May and explained the situation. The lady with whom I spoke said that she would arrange a refund by BACS (even though I told her that I had paid by credit card) and she took the details of where I had booked and then asked for my bank details. She obviously had my booking in front of her because at the end of the conversation I asked her how much refund I would be getting and she quoted the price I had paid to the nearest penny. I had not given her this amount earlier in the conversation so she obviously had all this information to hand. I asked if it would be a BACS payment even though I had paid by credit card and she confirmed that this would be the case. I askedhhow long it would take to receive the refund in my account and she said ""between 7 and 20 days because she would have to pass it to the Accounts Department for processing.I'm afraid that I am quite cynical of success having read so many reports however, can only hope! If this does not work I shall be left with no alternative but to pursue a Section 75 claim or County Court small claim."
"As I have explained previously, when a booking is made through a TUI store the credit/debit card details are only kept locally in the store and are not available to the staff organising refunds, so the refund has to be made by BACS transfer. This will obviously take longer than refunds for online bookings, but they will be made as soon as possible under the current circumstances."
"We had a holiday booked due to depart todayWe had made some payments by debit card and some by direct debitWe have be refunded all money paid by debit card but have yet to receive the refund for the direct debits,"
Yes I received a full refund 5 weeks after my scheduled departure date which was 10th April
"Don't even get me started with TUI - I spoke to guy called Ben nearly 4 weeks ago and was told that I should receive my refund within 5 - 10 working days it's beginning to really get me annoyed and stressed by it. As i write this I have been on call hold for over an hour. I just want to know what is going on. No Calls, No Emails, NO NOTHING!! For crying out loud TUI get this sorted or I'm never booking with you again.Edited: 5:04 am, May 28, 2020 "
"If I was in your shoes, I'd give up on communicating with TUI and get my card provider involved instead. Trying to talk to TUI looks like the equivalent of banging your head against a hard wall."
Time to receive your refund seems to vary depending whether you booked on-line or in store and how you paid.Maybe Tom N could say which of the permutations apply to him.Oh...and what his departure date was.Oh...and if he's received his refund credit yet. If you have this code you can apply on-line for refund.
We booked Florida for 7 people for 4 April -18 Apr and have heard nothing. We booked in store and are still waiting. It is now the end of May.
"Had an email today saying that our June 15th holiday is cancelled, as expected.Spent two hours on hold until an agent answered, told him that I didn't want the refund credit voucher but would like a full refund to my credit card. After he put me on hold, I was cut off.Then I received an email that I had cancelled the holiday, so was due nothing as a refund!Tried to get through again, but no luck tonight so will have to try again tomorrow.If that fails, I will have to contact my bank and invoke section 75."
"Today I have received my full refund for my cancelled holiday. Departure date should have been 11th May. I had booked on line and used both a credit and debit card to pay. Initially made in excess of 50 unsuccessful phone calls, wrote a letter to the registered office, texted and used Messenger to try to get my money refunded, all to no avail. A member of this forum posted a message saying they had seen on the website that TUI were making it possible to apply online for refunds (this was before TUI sent their “We're Sorry” email) I completed the online refund request form, received an acknowledgment. Two days ago I received an email confirming the refund and today the money has been credited to my accounts as 3 separate payments. Judging by members’ posts on this forum it appears easier to obtain a refund if your holiday was booked online using credit/debt card. Do hope everyone gets their money back asap."
"Not had a refund from tui ,cannot get through on the phone,booked my holiday 24/12/2019 for holiday beginning 31/3/2020 been waiting since then for my refund, and still waiting,received email last week saying I would receive my refund by the 27/5/2020 but still no refund..Will not use tui again,I even received a tui code number for my refund,Still waiting in hope."
"Further to my recent posts..Was notified of my holiday being cancelled yesterday (22nd June departure). Went to TUI 'Managemybookings'...Rebooked the same holiday, albeit for a slightly earlier date in 2021. Published price was more expensive. Discount was however applied automatically, so same price as I had paid for 2020. No codes needed. Confirmation was immediate. Sorted within minutes of cancellation....If you really don't need a refund, then this is an option."
"SimonThis is what we want to do - our holiday was cancelled yesterday, departure date 12th June.But when we try to rebook for 2021 it asks for the refund credit code which we don't have.Can you please let me know how you did it.We've tried all sorts of things within 'manage my booking'.We've even tried going through the booking process hoping that it would recognise that TUI have over £1500 of our money but that just asks for payment details.There's now a video of 'how to use your refund credit online' on the TUI website and that says you need your refund credit code.I feel like I'm going round in circles.Thanks"
"Let me paint the positive first. I had booked a holiday with Tui for 4 January 2020 to the Algarve, Portugal.All went very well. Service was good, airport transfers on time and professional. Of course at this time, no one was aware that in about 10 weeks time a pandemic called Covid-19 would cause global cauos and confusion.I decided on the 30th of January 2020 to re-book with Tui also to Portugal. I do my bookings in store as I like personal attention, to be able to ask questions etc. I paid in full for my holiday departing 19th of April 2020. Tui is quick to collect the money. As we all know, after 23rd March, 2020 the FCO cancelled all flights.TUI first cancelled all holidays up and to 16th April 2020. Mine was still valid. In the beginning of April 2020 TUI cancelled more holidays from 17 April 2020 until mid May 2020. I later received an e-mail from them confirming my holiday has been cancelled. Further informing me that I will receive a credit voucher 4 weeks after my departure date. So in my calculations I should have this credit voucher by 19th of May 2020.I was patient. Apparently TUI has 900,000 refunds to attend to. At one time tried to call them, to no avail. Recorded messages then call drops off. You don't get to talk to an adviser. Then I read that a German bank gave TUI a loan of 1.6 billion pounds. Furthermore their directors refuse to accept a wage cut or wave their profits in the face of Covid-19.Later I read in the Daily Express dated 14th of May 2020 that TUI is axing 8,000 jobs. Putting all this into context I realise, come to the conclusion that TUI is holding on to people's monies. TUI is cash strapped! If they refunded 900,000 people we will have a 2nd Thomas Cook.TUI going all out to ignore, avoid clients. Making it impossible for any client to get in touch, contact them. To date, 29th May 2020 I still have not seen or received the so called credit voucher. Where is it? Does it exist??On advise from a friend I wrote an old fashioned hand written letter to TUI. Posted the letter recorded mail. Why a letter? Well I though nobody these days write or send letters anymore. Maybe when they receive my letter they will be shocked because who sends letters?I just hope that my letter would have the desired effect. Then of course there is file 13 that is the old fashioned waste paper basket or shredder if TUI can afford one? Maybe my letter sadly ended up there?I was one of the Thomas Cook clients when they nose dived. I must say that within a month of Thomas Cook out of business I had my refund. No difficulties, easy on line claim form. I can't claim on line with TUI because they are withholding my credit note without which I cannot claim. In conclusion I am deeply shocked with TUI treatment. Maybe they should become another Thomas Cook. At least that way Atol should pay out sooner than TUI when they were operating. I will never do business with them again!!"
We were due to go to India 21st March but this was cancelled 4 days before departure. We opted for a refund as we were unsure when we would be able to travel and how long a credit note was valid. We informed the branch we would like a refund. 2 weeks later we informed the call centre that rang that we wanted a refund.Over 10 weeks later we still have nothing!I have tried contacting them on the 3 0203 451 xxxx numbers given. All give the same recorded message that we are too busy try again later and they hang up.
"Paula CIt really was so easy that I can't remember the exact process! I initially looked at the TUI coronavirus page which includes 'CAN I AMEND MY BOOKING WITH MY INCENTIVE IN 'MANAGE MY BOOKING' BEFORE I RECEIVE MY REFUND CREDIT?' which explains those circumstances where it is, and is not, possible to do this.You have to have booked ON-LINE, not in a store. Also you cannot do it if you have booked extras like insurance/parking/airport hotel. In those cases you can amend, but only by phoning....Otherwise I simply followed the prompts, filled in the details of my new holiday choice, which then led me to a summary of my original holiday price, alongside the comparative price of the new holiday.... and whether my incentive covered this new cost. .. which in my case it did.If you wish to spend more than your original price, and more than is allowed for by the additional 20% incentive, it will tell you how much the differential will be. You can go through this whole process without confirming your intended change till the end....so you can play around with your choices if your not sure of the cost of your new booking, and determine the cost implications.Good luck..!Edited: 2:04 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"Yay! Finally got confirmation today of my refund from last minute.com. We were due to fly on 4 May, they cancelled one week before.A few weeks ago i was offered a refund, vouchers, or credit note, offering an extra cash voucher if we took anything but the refund. We opted for the refund as felt uneasy accepting credit notes in these uncertain times. We had lost our holiday, we didnt want to lose money too. Today we were informed that it will take 15 days to be paid back to our credit card.I can live with that.Just hope it will be easy enough to get the refund from my credit card account to my bank account. It has come through quicker than I was expecting and hope this offers some reassurance to others."
"Hi SimonMany thanks for your prompt reply.We booked online and added nothing to our original booking other than upgrade of luggage for 1 pax.We've chosen the exact holiday we want - as you would for a brand new booking but we get no prompts and it just takes us to the payment page as if TUI don't have our money.If we access our cancelled booking then choose the holiday we want and go to booking, it just asks us for the refund credit code - which we don't have.We're both computer savvy but this has us beaten.And of course, you can't get hold of TUI to sort out something simple that will benefit THEM financially without spending hours on the phone. And they are closed at weekends.From being quite supportive and tolerant of TUI throughout this crisis, my patience is wearing thin."
"Re my previous post:I had the cancellation email on Thursday 28th regarding our June 15th departure and as I wanted a refund instead of a Refund Credit, I phoned TUI (020 3451 2868) and after nearly two hours on hold a very helpful guy promised to sort it out for me, with a full refund within 3 to 5 working days.Much to my surprise, when I checked my bank accounts this morning, the refund was already there!It is a pain having to hang on the phone for so long, but if you want a refund more quickly it's worth it. The online refund request form requires the Refund Credit code, which is sent out just after the original departure date.Paula C:If you wait a couple of weeks, you will get the Refund Credit plus the 20% booking incentive and you can then make a new booking with no problems.Edited: 6:03 am, May 30, 2020 "
"David LThanks.Our holiday is 2 weeks yesterday (12th June) and the website originally said they'd email the refund credit within 28 days of departure date.Which is almost another 6 weeks.The accommodation we want to book is very small (14 rooms) and only 2 (at best 3) of the type we'd want to book. And is very popular with repeat customers.So really, time is of the essence and that's why I'm desperate to do what TUI say we can do and rebook a holiday online using our refund credit and booking incentive BEFORE we get the refund credit code.But we can't do it. :0("
"Paula C, sorry I can't help with your rebooking problem as it's not something I've tried.However, you may not need to wait 6 weeks for your refund credit. My wife had a booking for early May which was cancelled and she received her refund credit email the day after her scheduled departure date.We phoned TUI (with the usual long wait on hold) and requested a refund, which appeared in her bank account the next day.That's why I said that you might only have to wait a couple of weeks for the refund credit."
"Was due to fly out to Vegas with 4 other people on 1st April with B.A staying in the Mirage Hotel.Had nothing back to from TUI with regards to each couples £2000.00 paid. Sort it out TUI , Stop stalling and start communicating with your customers . People will not hold you responsible for this virus , But will remember disgraceful customer service.."
"David LThanks for the help anyway.I might try to get in touch with TUI tomorrow.If the holiday is no longer available, I'll have a full refund.TUI's loss."
"Paula CIt does seem to be getting easier to get through since they introduced the online refund request form.If you start early at 9 am when they open, each time if you get 'we are very busy, please try later' hang up and redial, then after a few tries you should get 'Welcome to TUI and First Choice' and a menu of options. You will then be put in the queue with the message 'all our agents are busy, please hold' from time to time.When you do finally get through, you should find the person very helpful in sorting out your problem, as I have.Good luck!"
"Thanks, David L."
"UPDATE: FULL REFUND RECEIVED! :-)My family were due to fly on 4th April on a First Choice holiday booked in a TUI store (not online) and paid for with a credit card in 2 payments (£600 deposit and then full balance). Holiday cancelled by TUI prior to departure (around mid-March). I waited until after the travel date for a refund (as instructed) but heard nothing. I kept checking back on the website and waited for TUI to contact me (as the website said). I tried phoning at one point but was left on hold for exactly 2 hours (honestly) before the call was disconnected! I therefore continued to wait for TUI to contact me until I saw a post from Martin Lewis with a number to ring (020 34512868) which I did... many, many times. Sometimes there was just a beep and I got cut off, sometimes I got the engaged tone, sometimes I got through 2 option menus to hear the recorded message that they were experiencing a high volume of calls and that nobody could take my call. However, I kept trying and eventually got through (12th May) and, after a 48 minute call, I was told that my refund request would be processed (even though I'd never had an email with a credit note/code). As I had booked my holiday in store and paid with my credit card I provided TUI with my bank details (on 12th May) so that my refund could be provided by BACS transfer but I still had not had my refund 2 weeks later. At the end of last week someone from TUI phoned me and explained that there were lots of problems with the BACS system (at the banks end) and so a small team were processing refunds directly. I provided by debit card details and the refund has appeared in my account today! :-)I hope that you all also get the refunds that you are entitled to soon."
"Re my issue detailed in replies # 401, 406 & 408:Spent 2 hours + on the phone to TUI - waiting for answer by a human and discussing our problem.We received an email cancelling our holiday on 29th May @ 10:11According to TUI, they sent our refund credit code out on 30th May at 02:00. We have NOT received that email. Apparently it can take 48 hours to arrive...The reason - so they say - that we are unable to amend our holiday online is because they have already sent the code out and it's to stop people doing an amendment without the code then using the code for another time.We COULD apparently have amended without the code in the 15 hour 49 minutes window between receiving the cancellation email and TUI (allegedly) sending out the refund credit code.Initially the agent said the code was on the original cancellation email. It is most definitely not.I have no faith whatsoever that our refund credit code is somewhere in the ether.Even though TUI have our money for the cancelled holiday plus the 20% booking incentive and that covers the new holiday (they would owe us £5.24), they cannot book our holiday without the code. And we can't book without the code. We would have to treat it as a new booking.So, we are sat waiting for an alleged email to arrive and can't rebook until then.Has anyone who received the cancellation email for holidays from 12th June to 30th June already received their refund credit code?"
"I have only just received my refund code. My holiday was booked to depart on the 20th April, I had a cancellation notice on the 21st April saying I would receive my voucher code 28 days after my departure date, this effectively would have been 18th May, but as I said at the start it's only just arrived. I then had to fill in a form online with my code to receive my refund, and this apparently will take another 28 days. I shall wait and see. But in answer to your question according to TUI website you will receive your code 28 days after your initial departure date."
"""But in answer to your question according to TUI website you will receive your code 28 days after your initial departure date.""NomadicwandererI know the TUI website says.My issue - detailed in reply # 408 - is:Our holiday departure date was 12th June and the website originally said they'd email the refund credit within 28 days of departure date.Which is almost another 6 weeks - possibly as long as 24th July!The accommodation we want to book is very small (14 rooms) and only 2 (at best 3) of the type we'd want to book. And is very popular with repeat customers.So really, time is of the essence and that's why I'm desperate to do what TUI say we can do and rebook a holiday online using our refund credit and booking incentive BEFORE we get the refund credit code.But we can't do it. :0(I just want to rebook another holiday with my money that TUI already have.If I wanted a refund or if the accommodation I wanted to rebook was a large hotel with 500 rooms, I'd be happy to wait for the refund credit code."
"Has anyone had a refund, if you paid online, via direct debit, and your refund was due today? And it still hasn’t come???"
"My daughter is still waiting for a refund as agreed by TUI this was April she has had NO return emails, calls nothing at least Jet2 have given me a full refund no loss of deposit they are fantastic....need to think seriously TUI are going down the pan quick withholding monies on goods they can not deliver is NOT acceptable"
"UPDATE:Re my reply # 415 which detailed my issue in replies # 401, 406 & 408:My refund credit code email came through yesterday at 18:00.My holiday for 2021 has now been booked with the money that TUI already had for my 2020 holiday plus the 20% booking incentive.I do not in any way believe that that email was sent out on 30th May at 02:00 as said by a TUI agent yesterday morning.I am convinced that it was generated as a result of my phone call in which I explained to TUI why I wanted the code.From reading posts on here and other public forums, I think TUI are being reactive on the phones. They have information on their websites saying your refund credit code will be sent out within 28 days of your departure date but if somebody gets through asking for something - e.g. refund credit code before without waiting the 28 days or a refund before they've received their refund credit code, they sort it out.Poster in reply # 416 received their code 6 weeks after their departure date. I got mine 11 days BEFORE my departure date.I appreciate that TUI may be getting more organised as time goes and maybe I'm not the only person whose holiday has been cancelled to receive their code 3 days after the cancellation email but I firmly believe I got it as a result of my phone call.I spent over 90 minutes waiting for someone at TUI to answer and a further 30 minutes talking to the TUI agent but it was worth it for me."
Paulu c#420 Because you used your 20% booking incentive as part of the payment is the whole of your holiday atol protected as the website says that part is not.
"cannot get REFUND CREDIT CODE. futile experience by email and phone, despite being informed (Martin Lewis and simon calder] assuring the public that new systems were in place.our cruise was curtailed on 11th March and were informed (TUI web site) that settlement would be made by 25th May 2020. STILL NO REFUND CODE.any fellow guest on Discovery received their refunds?"
Have not heard anything from tui and my holiday date was 24 may tried phoning umpteen times but it's automated can't get to talk to anyone. I do not want a credit note as we are pensioners just want a refund.
"PhyllisAs another poster said up-thread, now that TUI allow you to apply for a refund online - but only after you've received your refund credit code - the phone demand is easing.But don't expect to get through straight away.As I said up-thread, I started ringing about 09:15 on Monday and got through to the 'press options ...' stage with the message 'we are experiencing very high call rates, it may take an hour for you to be connected to one of our agents'.I was on for over 90 minutes, listening to the recorded loop before a human answered.Perseverance is required.So to recap - my holiday (departure date 12th June) was cancelled on 29th May and I received my refund credit code on 1st June.I have used the code to rebook, but I could just as easily used it to request a refund online.Things may depend on how you booked (online or in-store) and possible how you paid."
Hi Robert i have received the refund confirmation email with break down of my payments but currently still waiting on any cold hard cash
"I eventually got through to TUI and requested a cash refund, the main balance of the holiday was paid on my debit card which i received back to my account, but the deposits of £400 were paid via Paypal, on which they said it would take 7-10 days, that was the 18th May, still not got it !!!I never received refund reference No and still haven't, so i suppose i will have to get in the phone queue again, mind you I'm used to queuing"
"Anyone had a problem using the refund code to re-book?Tried to rebook our cancelled package holiday for June next year, entered the code and it says it's invalid!Checked and double checked the code from the e-mail and I'm definitely entering it as it shows.Tried ringing Tui but of course couldn't get through.Decided to try on-line refund request instead and the code was accepted!Maybe a global pandemic and a non functioning rebooking code are signs we shouldn't go to Tunisia after all!"
ClaretAlI've read on another forum that at least one person had the same issue - and that poster said a Google search had revealed that other people had the same problem.My code was accepted for rebooking.
Has anyone actually had there money back after processing refund code ?Just wondered how long it takes to get it ?We were due to fly on 11th June and got refund code on the 1st June and requested refund same day
"Have you checked your emails and spam folderEdited: 8:12 am, June 03, 2020 "
My holiday in May was cancelled and after a lot of chasing/complaining I was told I would receive my refund four weeks from departure date. I paid for the holiday over four months Direct Debit. This morning I received a payment which amounted to one Direct Debit payment and not the full amount. I know have the tedious task of chasing them again!!!! My daughter booked with Jet2 and they have been brilliant. Last time I give TUI my custom!!
Well done getting something back. I paid same way with direct debit. Holiday cancelled on 9th April and still no refund. Even though I had email from them saying i would receive full refund in upto 4 weeks. Think we are on week 8 now.
"We eventually got through on the refund phone line and received the deposit after 5 days. We were promised the rest which we paid by direct debit after 10 days, no sign of it yet."
"You are lucky. My holiday was from 4-18 May abd still not received email refund. Have emailed,sent messages thru messenger and tried to ring hundred of times. Now really angry as owed a lot of money"
"Raymond P (reply #421)Hisorry I missed your question:""Paulu c#420 Because you used your 20% booking incentive as part of the payment is the whole of your holiday atol protected as the website says that part is not.""I too read that on the TUI website.But we have our ATOL certificate and it says ""This confirms that your money is protected by the ATOL scheme if your travel company collapses.""Nothing about only 80% (my original payment for 2020) being protected.Hopefully things will look up for TUI now that they've agreed a deal with Boeing re the 737 Max:https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/ju…""Shares in Tui rose by 10% on Wednesday as investors welcomed the deal, which the company said would ease financial pressures."""
"@ pennydawnI only tried to ring TUI once after they advised me on 29th May that my 12th June holiday was cancelled.I started trying shortly after 9am, spent just over 90 minutes waiting for a human to pick up and then I got through.Is the number engaged when you ring or are you not prepared/unable to hang on until you get through?Edited: 4:08 am, June 04, 2020 "
"Thanks Paula #435 we were due to fly this Sunday, awaiting refund code.Not sure yet whether to rebook or take refund."
"Our holiday to Italy for June 22nd only got cancelled last Thursday May 28th.Weve read all the stories and were looking for a long slog to get a refund...however very pleasantly surprised.My wife ( lead name ) received notice we should receive a credit refund voucher no within 28 days of the holiday....she actually received this on Tuesday June 2nd.Therefore she rang Tui yesterday lunchtime and waited 90 mins for a lady to pick up the phone.My wife requested a refund and without argument the lady said she had transferred a deposit of £200 to my wife’s card,a £600 payment and a final payment of £2800 to my card and stated we should have the money in 3-5 working days...to my shock and delight the money was actually in our accounts this morning...we feel very lucky compared to some."
"Hi has anybody received any refund? I was due to fly 20th may but this was cancelled and I was given a refund credit, I have contacted for my refund (cash)which the guy couldn't do and would pass my info to the finance team? It's been 3weeks since I requested this and nothingNot sure on where I stand contacting my bank as I paid by direct debit?"
I’ve been waiting 8 weeks for a refund. Tui put the phone on me last time I spoke as they said they couldn’t help anymore. Disgusting customer service. Lies after lies. Missed all their own deadlines.
"Still waiting for a full refund from TUI. Should have flown to Barbados in March to visit my parents who are 86 and 94, both not of good health. Flight cancelled due to the virus. Very angry and disappointed in TUI for not refunding."
Hello I have some positive news to everyone who is waiting for a refund from TUI .I have received a refund from them fro the full amount today 5/6/20 I paid for my holiday via debit card my holiday was booked for the 27/5/20 it got cancelled and after many long calls on the phone to TUI I was sent a refund credit voucher.. once I had this I called them back up but was not able to get through at all so I filled out the refund form that they have now added to the website for a cash refund .. filled out all my details and they ask for a refund credit code which you get once you have been emailed the credit voucher .. sent back a generic email saying your Cash refund will take 4 weeks .. I'd say it took about 2 weeks in total to get my money back !! All I can say to everyone is just be patient I know it's hard but they are issuing cash refunds but you can't get one until they email the Credit Voucher code to you then you just need to request a cash refund via the website .. hope this helps!! I'm just happy I have the money back in my bank x
"Holiday booked for 25/ 4 have heard nothing from TUI at all cant get through on phone spent hours +,,emails can anybody help pleasèee"
"Linda HUnfortunately, I think it's just a case of persevering with the phone. Someone said up-thread that they had stopped emails and last time I looked (last Friday), they'd removed all contact email addresses.I phoned them on Monday morning, maybe about 09:15.I got the 'we are experiencing a high volume of calls and it may be an hour before you can speak to an agent' but you just have to hang on, listening to the loop until you do get an agent.It took me 90 + minutes before an agent answered.Are you getting through or are you getting the 'ring back later' message? There is no magic number to call.There doesn't seem to be a lot of logic behind when refunds are paid.It may depend on how you booked (online or in-store) and how you paid."
Refund voucher emailed last thurs. Contacted tui had to wait 55 mins on telephone asked for refund no problem. Operator said it would take 3 to 5 days for the money to go back into bank. Today is fri one week on and my money is in the bank. My 2 sons have had no acknowledgment from their travel companies. Well done tui 5.5 2020
For anyone who has got their refund credit code:there is an online form on the TUI website to apply for your refund.I'd use that rather than take the time to ring TUI.
Yes had full refund paid back into bank within two days of asking after about onehundred phone calls one hour fifty minutes on phone but worked so keep trying
"Tui arn’t issuing direct debit refunds, been waiting 8 weeks. Spoke to 11 different people, 100s of phone calls hours and hours of being on hold. All they say they can do is send an email to refund/ finance department. I’ve had mine escalated 11 times. They missed their deadline of 4 weeks, they then missed deadline of 27th May then they missed their deadline of 1st June, and they’ve also missed their last deadline of 28days. Absolutely terrible company. They haven’t got a clue. Supposedly the finance department doesn’t have a phone... last phone call I had this week they just said they don’t know how long it will take, and joked that it could be next year... and when I said I wanted to speak to a manger they said sorry there is nothing a manager won’t tell me that’s any different. Useless company, the excuse that a direct debit refund is much harder to do than a card refund is beyond me. It’s a card, it’s a bank account, just refund the money."
"""the excuse that a direct debit refund is much harder to do than a card refund is beyond me.""According to TUI website:""It’s taking us a little longer to refund direct debits as mandates are cancelled. We expect to process your refund within 28 days. ""And of course, bank staff levels are not at 100% levels either so delays are further compounded.I wonder if this crisis will change the way people book and pay for holidays.Booking online and paying by card seems to be the easiest way for companies to refund.TUI say they have completed all payments made by debit/credit card for holidays up to 16th April.Edited: 3:10 am, June 06, 2020 "
Tui say they have completed all refunds... is a lie. They have also taken off the faq about people who paid by direct debit before 16th April. As these were meant to be completed by 1st June. 28 days has been and gone! Useless.
"Yes i got a full refund today 06/06/2020. my holiday was cancelled by Tui on the 21/03/2020 for holiday on the 05/05/2020.I got my credit voucher ,but wanted a cash refund,so i filled in the online form for a cash refund and three weeks later ,today 06/06/2020."
"Received a discount code from TUI a few days ago and tried to book a trip for January with it, however, after copying and pasting the code into the appropriate box all I get is 'code not valid'.No e-mail address for customer service and no reply when I returned the e-mail asking for the problem to be resolved.....not happy with TUI!!!!"
GazI've read that somebody else had the same issue.My refund credit code worked fine.There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to anything at all.
"Paula, it was as you say a refund crdit code, not a discount code, tried it numerous times now and still says 'code not valid'.Why would a company be stupid enough to provide credit-booking code that doesn't work and not provide a contact number/e-mail to resolve the issue? Its as if they are deliberately trying to antagonise people, if they are its working. They are now not even working weekends to try and resolve customer issues, even though they have staff furloughed? Seriously its amateur night by TUI, looks like the company is run by idiots."
GazHere's a link to the faqs with videos and instructions on 'how to use my refund credit':https:/…coronavirus-faqsIt also gives a number to ring if all else fails.Hope this helps!
"I agree, Gaz, it's beyond belief.I can't understand why some codes work and some don't.I had a very frustrating time last week when TUI advised me on 29th May that our 12th June holiday was cancelled.I simply wanted to rebook for 2021 without waiting for my refund credit code - TUI said it was possible.Computer said 'no'.Computer said 'no' for about 5 hours regardless of how many different ways we tried. Until we gave up.I rang TUI Monday morning about 09:15 and managed to get in the queue. I hung on for just over 90 minutes until a human answered.I didn't really believe the explanation why I couldn't do what TUI said I should be able to do but the agent said she'd send out a code.That arrived later that day and I was able to use it to rebook."
"My refund code kept being rejected as 'invalid' when I tried to re-book our holiday for next year so I gave up in the end and applied for the cash refund instead especially as the rebook price kept creeping up.You still have to enter the code of course but this time it was accepted!No idea why the code was accepted when I applied for the refund but not when I was trying to re-book but hey-ho, too late now.Edited: 6:41 am, June 07, 2020 "
"Hi David LAs above, I finally got my holiday rebooked.Thanks for your support and advice last week. :0)I think the phone number is the same regardless of what your issue is.But I'd imagine the volume of calls are reducing since TUI set up an online refund form.Although it was frustrating at the time, I didn't think 90+ minutes was too bad to wait to get sorted."
"Paula CGlad you managed to re-book your holiday, pleased that I could be of some help.Yes, the queue isn't too bad really, I just put the phone on speaker and browse the web while I'm waiting!"
"@ Gaz F:""Received a discount code from TUI a few days ago and tried to book a trip for January with it, however, after copying and pasting the code into the appropriate box all I get is 'code not valid'.""Have you tried typing the code in rather than copying and pasting?Suggestion from another public forum.

I have just received a refund of £1824.00 but the problem is my holiday cost £6325.00.Somehow they think it is funny to pay me a third of it ... Tried calling but no answer .
"When you paid for your holiday, did you pay in instalments, and one of those was for £1824? It might be that TUI are refunding in separate amounts, I know Jet2 are refunding that way."
@ Dave sThe reason there's no answer is because they are only open Monday to Friday.It says so on their website.And I think Sunmagic is probably right about why you have only been refunded part of what you've paid.Maybe tell us how you did pay (bet it wasn't deposit first then full balance both by credit card).
"I cancelled my holiday with them for this August on the 19th of May as I’m self employed and rapidly depleting my savings. (I don’t qualify for credit).I lost the deposit £400 but I still haven’t had a refund for the rest! Whilst I appreciate they’re busy they have an additional £2,700.00 of my money in their bank and whereas It took up to 10 days to refund for a couple of people, it’s gone past that. Anyone else in the same boat?"
"Hi, we cancelled our holiday in March, we were supposed to travel on May 8th...….still waiting for our refund"
"We were due to fly to the Canaries on 14th March. TUI cancelled the holiday. We are still waiting for a refund. I paid with a debit card through one of their stores (Burgess Hill). I tried to pay online, but at the time, there was a problem with the website. When I ring up, there is just an automated voice saying a refund credit is on the way. I can't find any other way of contacting them. I am thinking of taking them to court to get my money back,Dan"
Does anyone know how I can actually speak to a human being at TUI?
"TUI's lack of communication is pathetic. They could have at least emailed me at some point to confirm they will refund me, but I have heard nothing from them since they emailed me in March to say the holiday was cancelled."
"""Does anyone know how I can actually speak to a human being at TUI?""Yes.Ring the number on their website.Persevere.I rang last week about 09:15. I got through to the recorded message that said 'we are experiencing a high volume of calls. Please hold'.I held for 90 minutes then a human picked up.Have you had your refund credit code yet?nikki sI wonder if they are working through in date order?Have you tried to ring them?"
"I have tried ringing many times, without success. The automated voice says try again later as they are experiencing a high volume of calls, then the call is terminated. There is no option to wait in a queue. As I have said, I have heard nothing from them since the holiday was cancelled on 14th March. It is very frustrating as I don't actually know if they are even processing the refund. It is now nearly 3 months.Why should anyone have to wait in a phone queue for 90 minutes? They should have refunded everone within 2 to 4 weeks. They are basically illegally holding on to our money."
"Well, I waited in a queue for 90 minutes because I wanted to talk to a human.I considered it time well spent.My holiday was cancelled by TUI last Friday 29th May.I was due to depart 12th June.I wanted my refund credit code so I could rebook with the money TUI already had of mine plus the 20% booking incentive.I finished my call with them around 11:45 on Monday 1st June.I received my refund credit code at 18:00 on 1st June.My 2021 holiday was booked by 18:10.I agree that you SHOULDN'T have to wait in a phone queue for 90 minutes.But do you have any other suggestion to get in touch with them?I've shared my experience with people to try to help them."

"As I said, when I ring, there is no option for me to wait in a queue, but I will keep trying. Did you book online or through a TUI store? It seems that those who booked online are getting refunded more quickly. Because I booked through a TUI store, I have to select that option when I ring. The automated voice either apologizes for the delay and says that credit refunds are still being processed, or, says call back later."
"I booked online and paid my low deposit, balance of deposit and final balance online, all by credit card.I think you are correct in that some types of bookings and some types of payments are proving more difficult for TUI to deal with.I wonder if this crisis will make people rethink how they book and pay for their holidays in the future."
"Just a quick update, on my experiance.We orginally cancelled before all the covid stuff kicked off, and was due a refund on 12th March, never happened.Tried to contact them through email and social media, all ignored, spoke to my bank about a card chargeback they intially said yes, then later said that it would be better to do it a different way.hung on the phone to TUI for 2hrs, got through and very rude lady said it was the wrong department and there was no way she could transfer me, tried again the following day got through to a guy who said, yes, my refund is in the ""queue"" but there couldn't give any idea when it would be.Fed up with the whole situation, I filed a money claim with the civil claims court online, and am hoping my money turns up very soon!Shame it took legal action, but TUI aren't interested."
"My holiday was booked for 20th May, cancelled by TUI, but they only confirmed a few days before I was due to fly. I had tried to find out what was happening prior to that, waited about an hour to get through but they couldn't tell me anything. I've made numerous 'phone calls to TUI over this time, it seemed to me that quite a few numbers were deliberate dead ends and the times I did get through, it wasn't to anyone helpful or bothered. It took weeks to get a refund code, which I had to wait for in order to get a 'cash' refund, then to be told that TUI were giving themselves four weeks from the travel date to actually process the refund! I managed to get through, after waiting the standard 90 minutes (must be preset on their 'phone system) to request a refund. Finally yesterday I received an email to say the full amount had been paid back to the credit cards used to pay. However I checked last night and again tonight but none of the accounts have been credited.Has anyone actually received a refund to their credit card? if so, how long after receiving the email did it take?I can't believe that TUI have been allowed to get away with treating customers as they have been and continue to. ABTA & the Government need to be investigating and taking action against them."
"I totally sympathize with you. I am in the same situation. I am thinking of taking TUI to court as well. I believe it will cost around £110. I was wondering if the court costs can be claimed back from TUI, not to mention the cost of all the anxiety and stress!Please let us know how you get on with the court claim.Thanks,Dan"
"IIf it's under £3000 (which mine was) the cost is £105, which you can claim back if the claim is succesful, you can also claim interest if you were told a date you were to be refunded and they haven't honoured it."
"Many thanks.But then, how long would it take for the court claim to be processed? If it's going to take months, we might as well sit tight and hope they refund us soon."
"IThe average if they don't defend it ,is 6 weeks, if they do (which would surprise me, but you never know) could be up to 6 months.I've already waited 12 weeks, and they still can't give me a timescale, I've got no confidence that I won't be in the some position in another 12 weeks, but YMMV."

We should have been in Croatia this week with Tui. Booked our holiday online & paid via a mixture of debit & credit cards. Received an email from them on the 22nd May with the refund credit code & I applied for a refund straight away. Received an email from them on Monday advising our refund was being processed and correct monies has been returned this morning to the debit/credit cards as per the payments originally made.
"@ FalconutI agree, I'd think I'd waited long enough too.The post by Mirfield Sian just shows how disorganised (and unfair) TUI have been with paying refunds.I wonder if the refund credit codes only apply if TUI have cancelled.You do seem to have fallen into somewhat of a black hole."
If anyone has been refunded how did it happen? Was it just reversed to your bank debit card/credit card initially used to pay?
Kirsty PHave you read reply # 485?
"I have received part patement, still waiting g for another £800 , if I owed them money they would have cancelled my holiday, typical, they can afford it I CANT !!!!!!"
"We have finally had our refund paid in our bank today! Our holiday was due in the 20th April, and we had a cancellation email on the 21st April, in the 21st May we had our credit note voucher code. I used the code that might to apply for full refund. Two days ago I had a phone call from Tui to ask for my payment card details, and today 11th June, lo and behold all money is in bank. The reason for them phoning me apparently is because I paid in shop and all details of payment cards are kept in shop. So voucher code does work albeit slowly."
"Booked Croatia in store in January, departing on 5th May. Cancelled by TUI as per everyone else's. Received email saying refund credit voucher would be received within 4 four weeks of departure date; (Note - this was a blanket email from their MD so would have gone out to everyone). Nothing received as yet. Phone calls get cut off, emails get no response. Was passed in comment a few days ago that they are ""Robbing Peter to pay Paul"". That's true. Surely their call centre must be taking an absolute verbal hammering, to the extent they are just hanging up or cutting the line. Surprised they are still even working there. Was told by their international call line that 500 staff had been brought back into store to assist. Don't believe anything off them."
"I was due to travel 22 April after it getting cancelled I e-mailed, phoned them a few times after forty mins hanging on got through for them to just say well request a refund for you but nothing so I wrote to them and sent it signed for cost me £2.45 but it worked week later the 2nd of June I got my money payed back onto my bank"
"Like this customer we were assured of a full refund to our Cr card within 14/21 days... nothing received 2 months later. You send apology ( MD) thensend a ref for a Cr voucher but we were promised a full refund a month before. Ring again 54 mins on hold to be given another tel no. Answers Tui no longer an active line! Completed refund firm from Cr voucher it wont recognise our booking ref...WHY? How about Tui contact us??? Our understanding , patience and tolerance is beyond being tested. Disgraceful! Disrespectful!!"

I’ve emailed TUI telling them a Refund Credit is not acceptable. If I don’t get a refund in 14 days I will pursue the credit card company as they are equally liable and need to comply with the law in my opinion.
"The credit card isn’t “equally liable”, but they can get action when you or I can’t. But if they determine the vendor is following the terms and conditions you agreed to, they will reject your dispute"
HazlenutThere is a form on TUI website to request a refund if you don't want the refund credit.I'm not sure if it works for all types of booking (online/instore) and all types of payments (cc/dc/direct debit) but surely it's worth a try...I'm not even sure that TUI will get your email as they've removed their email address from the 'contact us' page and someone posted on here a while ago that they'd stopped emails.
"PatsDid you use your refund credit code to request a refund online?Given the length of time people have been waiting for refunds, it might be a bit soon to expect your refund if you only got the code 12 days ago.NOTE: I'm not saying this is right, just pointing out that if you read the thread, some people have been waiting much longer than that."
"PaulaYes I used the refund code same day onlineAlso people we were going with got there code same time and applied it and they got there refund today.Edited: 8:58 am, June 12, 2020 "
"PatsI've said this many times since this crisis affected holidays:there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to who gets their refund when.It's really bizarre.One poster on another forum said their holiday for 16th JULY was cancelled.TUI rang them to tell them this, asked if they wanted a refund or credit note.They said 'refund' and it was in their account in 24 HOURS.Maybe as your friends have got their refund yours will be with you soon - assuming you both paid by the same method."
I have sent you a pm Paula
"Low and behold, a week after issuing court proceedings, full refund this afternoon."
"That's great news. I've just made a court claim online - fairly painless. TUI have till 6th July to respond, though they can request an extra 2 weeks."
Only received just under a third back don't know how this works out not happy
I received refund credit code on the 1st June applied online for a refund straight away this afternoon have received email saying that full refund has been given ... will be happy when it's back in my bank
"I only received a 3rd of my refund & Tui said it had been past to the financial team??? I'm still not sure what is happening and why I have an outstand payment of £543 as I had paid up in full. I will fight this until I get a full refund.Edited: 1:27 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"For those people (including the poster in reply #508 who worryingly has exactly the same user name as me) who have only had part payment refund, have a read back over the last couple of pages."
"For me, the best way to 'fight' (like the previous contributor who advised me) was to make a court claim (I have been waiting since 14th March for my refund).There is a new online service:https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claimIt took me about 15 mins to file the claim. It cost me £105 which I will get back if I win, plus lost interest of 8% for the past 3 months.Failing that, wait till TUI go bust, then you can claim your money back through your ABTA cover!Good luck!"
"Are you sure about that? I thought it only applied to credit cards, but I could be wrong."
I think people should familiarise themselves with what a chargeback is and what a Section 75 is and decide if either applies to them.
"TUI PRE-PAID TRAVEL MONEY CARDTui have not satisfied my requests for refund of balance remaining on my Tui Travel Money Card.They have sent me written confirmation that a bank transfer has been raised for payment of £nnn to my bank account. But they have not done so. I spoke to their customer services department today, They admit that they haven't settled my claim for refund, and that they should have sent me the money by now, but also told me that they cannot tell me when I my money will actually be refunded to me! This is disgraceful If their failure to refund continues, I will have to report TUI to the respective authorities and also initiate legal action.In the meantime I strongly recommend that people avoid using a TUI for TRAVEL MONEY CARDS, but entrust their hard-earned cash to a more trustworthy company."
"@ Teddy WYour post does not make it clear that chargeback and section 75 are 2 different things - it may be the lack of punctuation.""If anybody want a refund all you have to do is go to your bank and asked for a chargeback on your credit or debit card sec75""Section 75 applies to credit cards."
"My nearest branch is a 20 mile round trip. So I phoned them on their ""I've Got A Query I'd Like To Discuss"" telephone number. They understood and said they would send me an email with my options. They did this immediately, and I chose ""Customer Services: Bank Transfer"", and also sent them the security information they wanted. They recommended I do this by email, which I did. Their options also stated that they would transfer the full amount to my bank account ""within a maximum of 30 days.""That same day they confirmed that my ""identification has been approved and a bank transfer has been raised for £nnn."" They added ""Our refund timeframe is 30 days, but always sooner where possible."" My apologies if I did not make this clear in my TripAdviser post.Edited: 12:47 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"We'll sort of, total holiday price was £3130 deposit £200 followed by £600 balance of £2330 later, so far have only received £2330, they seem to be holding on to the deposit, by the way THEY cancelled the holiday, not us"
"Update to my posts 514 & 516.TUI have just contacted me and said ""We will do all we can to get this (refund ) back to you by the 22nd.""Let's hope they mean by the 22nd of June. 2020!"
I’ve had a cancellation email but it’s saying it’s only paying £ 1500 instead of the £3095 I’m owed then it’s saying something about Coronavirus override it’s so confusing. I’ve read a few previous posts where people are saying they are getting paid dribs and drabs . Are they legally allowed to do that. Has anyone who’s been paid in different amounts got all their money back ???
AlipoolI've not read anything - on here or on other public forums - about 'coronavirus override'.Does your letter really say they are only going to refund half of what you've paid?That doesn't sound right at all.Do you mean they are refunding part now and part later? Is that what you mean by 'getting paid in dribs and drabs'?
"DETAILSHoliday Cost£3,094.40Total paid to date£1,381.06Cancellation Fee£2,784.96Coronavirus Cancellation Fee Override-£2,784.96Refund£1,381.06This is what it says I’ve paid all my holiday in full so have no clue what this means .Please note this is not a VAT invoice"
Also I was offered a credit note for £ 3790 if I booked another holiday
I have rebooked for next year. The holiday was a lot dearer but they took just over £400 off as an incentive with me still having to pay another £310. When I look it up on manage my booking it says outstanding amount just under £800. When I go to my confirmation information it says payment due next March £310. Their system is always rubbish. As it was very hard to obtain a refund when we applied and thought they may not cancel the holiday we moved it to next year. (Two weeks later they cancelled it) When things settle down and they are a bit easier to contact I will try to see if I can cancel then. I have travelled with Tui about 4 times a year for many many years but will never book with them again. This year we booked for the first time with Jet2 as well and they refunded straight away with no problems.
No refund past the 10 June disgraceful never book with them again set of crooks
"Hi I put in for a refund to original payment method 4 weeks ago from Tui and STILL NO REFUND!! I think it’s awful that they are so quick to take but not quick to give back! The annoying part is that when you click on refund on their site it still comes up with will be refunded back to original payment within 3-5 working days ! So that’s bad that they still have that up , it should clearly state a minimum of 4 weeks ! I spoke to Tui on the phone after being on hold for 2 hours , to be told no more than that and that speaking to the manager wouldn’t get me anywhere as they only have the same information as themselves! Ok strange .So 5 weeks in STILL WAITING ,AWFUL ,will not use them again ."
Absolutely disgusting that firstchoice is trying to get out of paying me what I’ve paid I’m absolutely fuming.
"@AlipoolDid you cancel your holiday or did TUI cancel it?If TUI cancelled it you should get a full refund (they send the refund credit code out and you can then apply for a full refund or use the code to book another holiday with 20% booking incentive).If you cancel, you lose your deposit plus whatever percentage is due under their terms & conditions. The closer to departure date you cancel, the more you have to pay of the full holiday cost.What was your departure date?The info you've posted from TUI is somewhat confusing."
Yes they cancelled my holiday I’ve just been on hold and after two hours I got through. I had proof they cancelled as they sent me a voucher for the cost of the holiday but I applied online for a refund.Then that email came and totally confused me.The lady on the phone said it’s because my first lot of payments were on a card that expired. The money I’m getting first is to go back on my recent card then the other has to go to the financial team.I said I wish the email had stipulated that as my email from TUI was totally confusing. So we will see what happens.
"TUI aren't doing themselves any favours, are they?"
They aren’t doing themselves any favours at all.
After a TUI phone queue nightmare in April I decided for the sake of my sanity to wait the four weeks (flight date 16th May) to receive my credit refund code. Yesterday I received an e-mail detailing the cancellation and holiday refund due to me. No code or other information is in the email ? I sent an e-mail back by return requesting clarification as to what this meant. This was today returned as undelivered. Please tell me I haven't patiently waited four weeks only to have to rejoin the phone queue .
"AlanGDDid you book the holiday in a Tui store?If so, that would explain why you haven't received a Refund Credit code, as Tui don't have your payment details since the stores are still closed.They have been contacting people in this situation to arrange payment by bank transfer if you wait."
No online. First Choice. I am really asking is it a 2 email process1. They tell you how much2. You then get a refund codeIf not then nothing will happen unless I ring them. Groan.
"I booked through a TUI store and my holiday was cancelled on 14th March. The stores were still open for some time after that. On that day, I had an email from the TUI store saying that my holiday was cancelled and I should try and get a refund through my travel insurance. But later, I had another email, from the main TUI address saying that I would receive a full refund and that I didn't have to do anything. So, TUI head office must have had my store payment details on their computer.So, I waited 2 weeks, then nothing. I checked the TUI website and the refund advice had been extended from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Towards, the end of May, they were saying all refunds would be processed by June 1st.The odd thing is, when I log into my TUI account, all details of my holiday have gone. I suspect the TUI store have tried to avoid refunding me and wiped me off their system but head office have since realized what they have done and are now playing catch up. All very suspicious.Anyway, I have now filed an online court claim to get my money back."
dander....I really doubt that the TUI store would have any reason to 'wipe you off their system to try to avoid refunding you'.But that's just my opinion.
"I should also mention that when the TUI store emailed me to say the holiday was cancelled, they summarized my account, which went something like:Cost of holiday: £1600Payment by me: £1600Cancellation fee: £1600Amount owed by me: £0. They then said - you make get the cost of your holiday back through your travel insurance.This was obviously incorrect, and I suspect it was a deliberate attempt to avoid giving me a refund. Then, later, TUI head office emailed me to say that I would get a refund.It was they who cancelled the holiday, not me. My point is - I believe they are deliberately stalling paying back customers, and hoping that some of us will just disappear off their radar.But, that is just my opinion (obviously)."
"I've had the exact same thing. Been told with the financial team. I've decided to ring everyday, they owe me £7,000!"
Well I got over half my money today all paid in the amounts I had paid it in. The other payment has to go to the financial team so no idea how long I’ll be waiting.danderrandan I got a similar email ii think they send it to confuse people.
Alan GD I got two emails.
My brothers holiday was cancelled he payed by his card.. his girlfriend is the leading passenger who will get the refund
ClareIt should go back to the card used to pay.
Clare - payment will go back to the cards as per payments paid. Both my partner & I made numerous payments between 3 different cards & the full refund we received was to each card as per the relevant payments made.
"I have had a refund credit code from Tui For a flight only which was cancelled on 23 March. The credit refund code came through on 5 May. When I log on to Tui to claim, it states it does not recognise my booking reference number.Any suggestions what I can do. I’ve tried calling but it’s over an hour wait each time. I have also emailed the chairman. NO RESPONSEAll I want is to know that I am in the system to get my refund?The recorded message say it will automatically be refunded into your account that you paid for the flight with. This will be within four weeks of your flight. If it recognises my booking reference to send me a refund code and states it doesn’t recognise it when I log on to claim it what can I do.Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"I was due to fly on the 6th July, it was cancelled by TUI last week. I received my deposit back today.Weird thing is I haven't received the credit refund email and I haven't requested a refund."
"""I was due to fly on the 6th July, it was cancelled by TUI last week. I received my deposit back today.Weird thing is I haven't received the credit refund email and I haven't requested a refund.""What if you'd wanted to use the refund credit + 20% booking incentive and rebook another holiday?TUI's reaction to this crisis appears to be totally disorganised and without any understandable reasoning."
"That was my thought too, though I was going to take the refund anyway. Looking into it, looks like the deposit was for the same amount as the insurance cost. So they may have just refunded the insurance?"
"Barbara PI'm afraid you'll just have to hang on the phone a bit longer, in my case it was nearly 2 hours.

"Wife and I went on Marella Dream cruise on 8 Mar 20 to Malaga around Spain, Portugal and Morocco.TUI cancelled cruise midweek and returned directly to Malaga and flew us home.Within 2 days back we both got severe Coronavirus, lasting 4 weeks, still recovering now.Despite 7 phone contacts of various TUI depts/shops all promising refund following quickly, still nothing!!Their reps seem so nice and sympathetic but their promises seem to evaporate.TUI blame Coronavirus but we’ve been waiting over 13 weeks.Been on over 60 Thomson/TUI holidays and 27 cruises and apparently that’s how little they care!Don’t think we’ll trust them again. Will have to resort to legal action."
How long did it take to show on other account
"Ok so my refund definitely was the insurance payment. I received my refund credit email last night. Since I wasn't due to fly until 6th July, it looks like they might have pulled their finger out."
"Update to my post # 518.Refund received today, June 19th, 2020."
"We received a partial refund from Tui on 16/6/20 , (the 2 instalments paid on a credit card)The middle instalment for £300 was paid on a debit card and that hasn't been refunded yet for some reason.Think we'll leave it until next week and if still not received will try and contact TUI"
"ClaretAIIs it possible that the debit card used has since expired and been replaced by your bank? I had the same problem with one of my deposit payments.You should get the refund if that's the case, but it takes a bit longer.Edited: 8:35 am, June 19, 2020 "
"Just to reinforce the fact that TUI have lost the plot...I've had an email from Andrew Flintham (Managing Director of TUI UK):""As your holiday approaches I wanted to share a few updates on how we are getting ready to take you away.""That will be the holiday that should have departed last Friday (12th June) that TUI cancelled.The holiday that would be halfway over if we'd actually flown.You couldn't make it up,Maybe they should concentrate on giving people refunds or answering the phone instead of writing and sending out meaningless, irrelevant emails.Edited: 10:00 am, June 19, 2020 "
"We had one too, which could be relevant for our next booked trip to Cyprus in September.Interesting that he says they won't take you to any destination where you could end up in Quarantine, which is almost everywhere at present, including the UK!Keeping fingers crossed for Cyprus, but it could be another Refund Credit operation - who knows."
Anyone know how they are refunding Direct debits? Deposit refunded today but the rest was paid by direct debit and no email at all or mention of the direct debit refunds. On hold for 90 minutes and then got cut off.
"From the Tui coronavirus faqs:'It’s taking us a little longer to refund direct debits as mandates are cancelled. Weexpect to process your refund within 28 days. 'https:/…coronavirus-faqsEdited: 3:10 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"I have 2 holidays booked with Tui, the 1st was 23rd May, I received my email credit refund last Fri (12 June), & did the online form for a cash refund. I had no problems with this & received an email straight away telling me it would take 4 weeks. My 2nd holiday is 25th August & at present is going ahead. Does anyone know if I decide to do a free amendment, will I get the extra 20% or is that only if Tui cancels? I really don’t want to do a long haul holiday at the moment."
Sorry but you will not get the 20% discount if you rebook without tui cancelling the holiday.
Just to report that I have had two refunds from holidays that I booked for May and June.Well done TUi.
"We've been waiting since April 8th for refund, I have even been told once that I had to sort it myself and phone jetset. Then I've been told 2 weeks, then 4 weeks, then 32 days then 32 working days. Written to CEO no reply. Now been put on some spread sheet where apparently get put to top of a list. Still nothing. Feel for the Tui workers because not there fault. But the company have not in my opinion come out well in this."
I have had a payment for £490 5 days ago they still owe me £400 am I likely to get this
@ Jonathon KYes - if TUI cancelled your holiday.Maybe not - if you cancelled.
"Hi all, Received my refund credit back on 18th May called 19th to request cash refund all processed find from there end but over a month on now and still no actual cash back in my bank. Anyone else waited this long and if so what have you done? ThanksLee"
I’ve had nearly half my money back in one payment but still waiting for over 2k an get no sense from them
Can anyone help me. I was due to go on holiday with tui 5 weeks ago. I booked via a store and I have herd NOTHING. I was in the middle of starting a new business during corona so I’m really desperate for any money I can now. I really need my refund
Charlotte FPerhaps the Tui coronavirus faqs might help:https:/…store-booking-faqs
We got a full refund but that was back in March/April as we were some of the first to have our holiday cancelled. We were due to fly on the day the UK went into lockdown and we got a full refund a month later...but then I guess TUI still had a 'pot' of money at that point.
So far ive had 1300 of the 2006 they owed me. No info on why its being paid back in installments...the credit note was in full so dont see the problam. Cant get through on the phone you cant email ...shambles. Jet2 were a lot easier and faster to refund.
"I was really surprised at how quickly I received my TUI refund. My departure date should have been 26th June and I received a refund credit note on 4th June. I wanted to apply this to another booking that I have but couldn't get through on the phone to do this so just applied online for refund. Received credit card refund 12th June followed by refund of direct debit payments 16th June. I had no communication from them other than generic email advising our dates were cancelled and I never spoke to anyone on the phone either as I couldn't see the point. The above experience was for an online booking. I understand store bookings are taking longer due to being booked on a different system and most of the staff being furloughed with the few remaining staff working from home without their usual resources.The previous comment mentions being paid back in installments and wonders why this is. Apparently all payments need to be refunded to their original method so for example, if you have used more than one card to make payments, or made several separate payments using other payment methods, (DD, Paypal etc), they all have to refunded individually as they were received. This info is available on the dedicated Coronavirus section of TUI website.Hope everyone gets what they're due soon :-)"
"""This info is available on the dedicated Coronavirus section of TUI website.""@Nickybr65I wonder why people don't go to the TUI website FIRST to see what information is available rather than signing up to a forum to ask a question that may be answered by the company that has their money..."
"""I truly wonder how they are deciding who should and shouldn’t receive their money in no particular order.""As has been said numerous times on this thread, a lot of it depends on how you booked and on how you paid.And I think a lot of people shouted loudest and got their refunds before people who were prepared to sit back and wait for TUI to get round to them."
I certainly didn’t shout loud I only made one phone call because the email about Coronavirus override was totally confusing. Until then I hadn’t spoken to anyone. I think it’s unfair people have been waiting months for a refund. I’m not complaining about getting my money back early and count myself one of the lucky ones.
"Sorry, Alipool, it was a general comment and wasn't referring to you.I remember you had a very confusing email from TUI.I really meant those people who were ringing up virtually every day to reiterate that they wanted a refund.There is someone on one of the destination boards who has sent emails to various people regarding the '7 day refund policy' that applies when a tour operator cancels your holiday.It's actually 14 days or 2 weeks but I don't think that was intended for times like these."
Yes I would happily have waited my turn it was just the emails I received were so confusing. It is awful what’s happening and I have a holiday booked in October that I hope goes ahead . Hopefully No second wave and some kind of normalcy with the travel industry. I really do feel sorry for the TUI staff dealing with this pandemic.
"Our honeymoon was cancelled in May. We were told our refund would be with us in 10days. Nothing appeared. We had rang tui so many times we’ve lost count, Got some real snotty customers service agents and some helpful ones. We have now been sent an email saying our refund and the amount is being processed. So it’s taken them 6weeks, after being told several times it’ll be processed and refunded prior."
"HI guys, we have taken the chance and changed our holiday to Lanzarote from this May to May next year. We did however book a number of trips via tui which we were told, would be refunded in to my account with in 10 days. We changed our holiday at the end of March as we didn’t want to risk traveling with my mom who isn’t of best health. Has anyone else booked day trips and not been refunded? I’m waiting on £576.50 off tui, They have fobbed me off, lied to me. We are so discussed with the treatment we’ve had. We vow after 20 years of traveling with tui never to use the company again.Edited: 2:40 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Forget a refund, not worth the hassle. Just ask your Bank to recall the credit card payment. HSBC completed the recall under section 75 within a few weeks - account credited!"
Supposed to be going to Grand Palladium Garden Beach Resort Sicily in September. TUI are about to take our last direct debit payment but I found out yesterday the hotel is closed until next summer. No word from TUI and the flight has also disappeared. Sent emails and messages but nothing.My daughter is also still waiting on a refund. :(
"After filing a court claim on 12th June to get my money back from TUI (after waiting 3 months for a refund), their solicitor emailed me today to say my claim has been approved and that I will be paid within 14 days plus the cost of the claim (£105).I was unfortunate to book my holiday through a TUI store. As 75% of their staff are furloughed (so they say), there has been more of a delay compared to those who paid online. I initially tried to book online, but there was a problem with the TUI website, so I rang the provided number, which put me through to a TUI store. Bad move, in hindsight!I seriously doubt if I will book a holiday with them again."
"I had two holidays booked with Tui, one on 23rd May, the other on 25th July. The May one to Menorca I received my credit refund email three & half weeks after due departure date, filled in online form same day & awaiting cash refund which they say will be with me within four weeks.Today I had a general email telling me my other holiday in July to Jamaica is also not going ahead, I’ve been told to expect a phone call so that I can amend the holiday ( with a £500 incentive) or can request a credit refund which presumably could be followed by a cash refund.I noticed that the incentive for rebooking with them has now gone from 20% down to 10%. Both my bookings were in store so understand it’s going to take a little longer to process. I’ve also noticed my local store now has staff inside but not yet open to the public.Hope this helps some of you."
My holiday 11/07/20 cancelled and finally got my refund this week. The only problem is it's short of £150 which was my deposit. Have been on hold for almost 2 hours trying to speak to someone.. I'm an NHS worker and this is my only chance to call ( not what I really want to do on my time off)
Give it another couple of days. There have been reports of refunds coming in separate payments.
"Yeah sure, il give them a couple of more days. I might as well. They’ve only had 160 of my days waiting on them. Few more won’t hurt. It’s not the amount of days given that annoys me. It’s the false refund dates, no replies to emails. And the lies that annoy me. I’m done with tui that’s it for me. They can shove the nearly £600 they owe me where the sun don’t shine."
“ They’ve only had 160 of my days waiting on them. Few more won’t hurt.”—-Your situation is obviously different to the previous post I responded to.
"Hi, just wondering if you received the full refund? TUI have been really good so far (I know they were terrible so was nervous!) but they cancelled my holiday yesterday and refunded me today! But only part of the money. I’m still owed around 1,800 that I paid on a credit card so wondering if that’s why?"
"Harper, see my reply #587."
No refund received as we took the chance and have changed our holiday and detonation to next year. I am however still waiting to refunded for all the day trip experiences I booked.
"""No refund received as we took the chance and have changed our holiday and detonation to next year. I am however still waiting to refunded for all the day trip experiences I booked.""So what did your bank say when you contacted them? (ref your reply #582)""I’m done with tui that’s it for me. (ref reply #588).But you've rebooked with them instead of taking a refund...?There's some information on the TUI website regarding excursions - no idea if it applies to you.For those people saying they've not had a full refund for their holiday payment, it seems that's how TUI are sometimes refunding.Don't know if it applies to both instore booking and on-line bookings.Don't know if it applies to certain payment methods.But people ARE reporting part refunds then getting the remainder refunded."
Hi revering to post 583 We are due to go to jamiaca with tui 18th September. We had a flight change from dreamliner to a virgin flight which as been cancelled as our friend had booked this flight. she recieved an email. knowing full well tui will cancel our holiday they took final payment last week so when would we get our money back
"@ # 594:According to TUI website:""If you have an existing booking, we promise we’ll be in touch to update you, prioritising those of you with the earliest departure dates first.• If your holiday booking falls between 11th and 31st July, we’ll contact you by 1st July• If your holiday booking falls between 1st and 31st August, we’ll contact you by 10th July• If your holiday booking falls between 1st and 30th September, we’ll contact you by 17th Julyso I guess they'll be in touch with you by 17th July.Then I guess you wait for your refund credit code.I'm sure there's some imformation on that on the TUI website too.But currently you can either use your refund credit code against another booking. TUI were offering up to a 20% booking incentive if that's what you wanted to do, but I've read that it might be only 10% now. Or it might be zero %.Or you can use your refund credit code to request a full refund. There's an online form for that on the TUI website."
Thanks for the heads up
"#582 I’ve been in contact with the bank ( Barclays). Who told me we still have to wait for tui as we paid for day trips over 120 days ago. Our holiday was cancelled for May, So we decided to rebook for next year. We choose not to take a full refund nor did we receive a 20% incentive on changing our holiday. I was however told that I would receive a full refund for all of the day trips. First I was told it would take 7 days. The i was 10 days, then I was receiving my refund by the 30th of May. Since the 30th of May I’ve had no reply from tui I’ve called and waited on the phone for over 2 hours for the line to be cut dead. We are not bothered about the money so much, it’s the false information. We as a family will still go on our holiday next May. But will choose an alternative travel company to purchase future holidays with."
No not sure what is going on past the 4 weeks when a refun promised baffled
We have been waiting since may 14th which was when we should have been on holiday my husband recieved the reference number 3 weeks ago and replied to them for a refund but are still waiting £1300 is a lot of money and like everybody we can't afford to lose it
"@ 597Ah.You tried to do a chargeback which has the 120 day limit.I guess you didn't pay by credit card?You would have had the option of section 75.Maybe TUI didn't have the 20% booking incentive back in May...although my 12th June holiday was cancelled on 29th May and I was fully aware of the 20% offer at that time and for some time before that because I was keeping my eye on TUI website.I think TUI gave out a lot of misinformation about refund timescales, perhaps because they underestimated the scale of the problem and the time things would take. And also possibly because some holiday bookings took more time e.g. store bookings appeared to be more problematical than online bookings.Direct debits took more time as they'd lapsed.Some credit cards were lost or expired.I don't know if any of those things affected your refund delay.Whether TUI gave you 'false information' or gave you what they thought was correct information at the time, I guess only TUI know.Some people appear to have received refunds very quickly so it's working in some way.I'm not defending TUI, I don't think they've handled this well at all.There is some information on TUI website about refunds for excursions - have you read that?"
@ Hilary S & Angela RThere is some information about refund timescales on TUI website.Have you read that?
"Many thanks for you time. I have read all of this information. As I booked via there app which is updated with new information, yes paid direct debit. Shame that it should matter."
"AntonyYou're welcome.I think the method of payment only matters because of financial restrictions/regulations - which has nothing to do with TUI.If you paid by credit card and your card is still valid, it would be easy.Paying by direct debit when the mandate has been cancelled involves a lot more contact between customers, tour operators and banks. Especially when banks have also been struggling to operate normally during covid.I really do think this is why a lot of people were told timescales for refunds and then TUI realised it just wasn't that simple.But that's just my opinion.I think this crisis may change how people book and pay for their holidays in the future."
"Hi, we had our flight only to Hurghada for June cancelled by TUI (we eventually got hold of them 3 days before we were due to fly, they said they did not have our contact details.. despite having mobile/BT and our address), they informed us that we would get a full refund by BACs into our account within 4-6 weeks -- still waiting here. However, my daughter due to fly to Dubai in July, was notified by TUI of the cancellation and her refund went straight into her account whilst she was still talking to them!!Also with myself, TUI are refusing to refund my car parking fee ( this was done with TUI at the time of booking the flights) saying that I have to go through Holiday Extras? They are refusing to refund as they keep insisting that I cancelled my flight!!!) surely my contract is with TUI who should refund this car parking payment??Anyway in answer to your question.. I live in hope for our refunds lol.. Good luck everyone"
"@ Steve B #604Did you and your daughter both book in the same way and pay the same way?If you didn't, that's probably the reason the refunds have different timescales.Did you book instore?If you did, it's quite possible that TUI didn't have your contact details, as I read they were having problems contacting customers who'd booked in store as they didn't have their details and of course the shops were closed.If you were due to fly even as early as the 1st June and TUI contacted you on 28th May to cancel - that's still not 6 weeks which is the longest timescale TUI gave you."
"No just getting runaround and last call to them on 24/6 i was allegedly speaking to a manager who was extremely rude when i pointed out all different excuses they had given and that i had call on loudspeaker and everything said was being documented so she ended call. I voluntery cancelled my holiday on 20/3/20 as we felt we didnt want to go to mexico on 6/6/20 due to covid 19, understanding that under normal cancellation policy we would loose our deposit. This was done in store over 14 weeks ago..........no curtesy calls, emails, letters or text messages from Tui giving updates on situation.....to say i amy angry is an understatement i will never ever give them my custom again or recommend them to others."
"I was told on an email with the MDs signature, that my refund credit would come by today for a cruise in April 2021 cancelled by TUI. It has not happened. I called just now and the lady said the business day is not over, she was right, by 20 minutes. This is just a credit not even cash. I was told this on May 6th, 55 days ago."
"I receieved half of my refund last week, not sure when the other half will be paid. I applied for it only a couple of weeks ago with refund credit note number. They say allow 4 weeks so hopefully the rest will arrive soon."
"Yes, we received a full refund middle of May, our holiday was due to start on 17th March."
"Nope! I had my refund credit, swapped for a cash refund, email on 1st June said allow 4 weeks for cash to be put back in my bank, that was yesterday. Over 2 hours on phone this evening and still on hold, now it's after 7 so no chance"
I booked through a travel agent so dont know if this makes a difference.Had our holiday cancelled for start of April and still havent had a refund.
"To date we have been waiting 33 days to hear anything about our refund, no credit refund notification, no email no phone call. We have received cheque for the "" holiday extra"" car parking fee via TUI but that is all. Cannot contact them on any of the numbers as they all give the same message and no matter what time we ring they say that the office is shut and to call back during normal office hours."
"TUI only have one number for all contact.The call centre hours for store bookings and the hours for online/app bookings are stated on TUI website.""To speak to the team, please call 0203 451 2688. If you booked in a TUI Store, you can call between 9am and 5.30pm from Monday to Friday.

"HiMy holiday was booked in a TUI store but with a third party tour operator. It was for 17th May.Yesterday I received a phone call advising me that they will pay back my entire holiday including the insurance cover, which I think is good.My question is this:I am supposed to hear from them this afternoon when they want my card details to refund the amount. This rang alarm bells but they told me the amount before I asked and it was correct.I intend asking many questions s before handing over any card details. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
"My youngest daughter and boyfriend were due to fly to Mexico on 1st July. They finally got notification of the cancellation around 10-days before they were due to leave. They had booked through Tui website online and had to wait on refund code by email. This arrived a couple of days after cancellation. The following day, she applied through her booking for a full cash refund (a Sunday) and by the time she checked her emails early on the Wednesday morning, the full amount had already been paid back to her Bank Account. I think they had originally said on the form that payment could take up to 28-days from date of travel, so she was delighted that it only took 3-days or so to get refund."
"So I checked for answers here about a month ago as I was anxiously waiting to hear about my refund. I held up no hope of getting it back but since I have now been refunded the full £2047.90 I can tell you how it all planned out. Due to depart on 19th June got a refund credit at the end of May without me contacting Tui. As soon as I got my refund code I applied for a refund got an acknowledgement email saying it would be with me within four weeks. A few days later I got a rather precious email that looked as though I was getting refunded nothing. So I panicked and searched the internet for answers but found no one else had reported on receiving a similar email. So I called them - I actually started to call at 8:55am as I knew that it would take me a few minutes to get through the automated system. My call was answered at 9:15 so not a long wait. The women who answered assured me I’d be getting the full amount refunded so I took that at face value. A week later I received £150. I read that if you paid monthly or direct debit it could come in a few payments so I tried to remain calm and told myself that they had the four weeks. After the first payment of £150 there was a gap of about a week I then received two payments on the same day one of around 1202 and something pence and another of 300.54. So I thought ok the rest must be coming ... a week past and I started to panic. So I called again. This time it took me 1 hour to get through I called at around 2pm this time. Spoke to a gentleman who said there was an issue and they had sent it onto the finance team to try the refund. However I had made a payment of 451.10 by card that he refunded there and then. That arrived in my account by the next day. After his reassurance I left it until the 28 days were up. However day 28 came and I was still £601 down. So I called the bank I thought that they would be able to recall the direct debits as I hadn’t received the goods. However I learned that this was not something they could do as there was no error made with the direct debit. Check directdebit.co.uk of your wanting more info on this. The bank told me to look here as I was dissatisfied about the lack of support regarding paying via direct debit. Lesson learned to always pay by card in the future! Anyway after calling the bank I called Tui again and spent 1 hour 15 waiting to get through this time I called at around 3pm. Spoke to a women who advised that the refund had been processed yesterday so day 29 and that it should be in my account working 4-5 working days. I checked my account later on last night to see that I had been refunded the rest of the money. So all in all it took Tui 30 days from the day I asked for the money back to refund it all. It was an anxious experience but I think that was mainly due to me reading all of the bad experiences people had. I was expecting the worst but I’m assuming Tui have got their act together now since my experience hasn’t been the worst as some others have unfortunately had to endure. I thought to share as a reassurance to others that they have refunded.Edited: 6:08 am, July 02, 2020 "
"Thanks for that, my daughter is waiting for direct debit refunds, she has been told timescales that have been and gone and now they are saying it was processed on 30 June and she should have it in her account by BACS within 10 days, really hope so. Still not sure I've believe them after all the misinformation so far."
"received my credit note but chose to ask for a refund through the on line from. i paid £1017 for week in crete.Received a strange email today saying that my refund will be paid which is £100 leaving a balance of £917.Not really sure whats going on here, anybody else had the same thingEdited: 4:53 pm, July 02, 2020 "
@ tkeeneyIf you read back a few pages you will see that some people have indeed had the same thing.
I have had a partial refund today from TUI on a holiday I am booked to go on in August. No email confirmation or anything. Any ideas anyone? I actually want to go and don't want my money back!!!
If TUI have given you a partial refund it sounds like they believe the holiday is cancelled.So if it IS cancelled you won't be able to go even if you want to.Have you checked if the holiday is still available on TUI website?I know they have been cancelling flights to certain destinations and cancelling flights from certain airports and combining flights from the same airport to the same destination on different days of the week.
"Ok so basically if you paid a deposit by debit card, then tui will refund this first and any money you paid via direct debit will come later in installments.Its a simple way for tui to keep hold of your money just a little longer."
"""Its a simple way for tui to keep hold of your money just a little longer.""Or it's an indication that refund of direct debits - where the DD mandates have been cancelled - are more difficult to arrange as it involves contacting banks - who are also struggling with staff levels because of corona."
"“ if you paid a deposit by debit card, then tui will refund this first and any money you paid via direct debit will come later in installments.Its a simple way for tui to keep hold of your money just a little longer.”—-If different refund methods take a little longer, why is it that you see it as a ploy for TUI to keep hold of your money a little longer?"
"Yes i can see it now, the reason is because when you pay by direct debit it takes a little longer to cancel and rearrange a refund.A payment from a debit card,ie your deposit takes no time at all.Ive used tui for years and trust them 100%."
"Thanks but do you know how long this takes once actioned? My daughter paid by DD and has been told weekly for the past 3 weeks it will be ""in account by Friday"".She has had her refund back as paid that on debit card."
Claire i received my initial deposit after only a few days but there is no mention or notification to make you aware they are doing this.ive only found out through this forum and it looks like its quite a few weeks before you will receive anymore money back
Did your friend get the rest of the refund back? I paid some on my Debit card and some on my credit card and I’ve only had my credit card amount refunded.
Update on my refund.I was on an important call on Thursday when Kay from TUI called to use the PDQ machine to give me my refund.She left a message to tell me she would call back.I suppose I should give them more time but I waited in from 13.00 Thursday and all day Friday and nothing.
"Tony, that's the problem, no emails of communication at all. Amy has been told three times that the direct debit refunds would be paid by BACS ""by Friday"". The latest story is ""within 10 days"". How long is it since you had your deposit refund?"
"Claire its only been like 5 days since i received my deposit, so i guess ive got a while to wait for the rest of my money.But your right, the communication from tui has been awful..."
we have difficulty getting in touch with tui by phone. makes you think that there is nobody on the other end of the line. we have received 2 refunds 19th June but not the bulk of the deposit paid. obviously they are holding onto the money. we paid all the deposits by credit card. Tui said that the refund would be paid in the same way as we paid the deposit and balance i.e. into our bank account. the shop where we live is not on the list of agents that are being opened for business so we cant even get in touch with tui that way. they will not be getting any more of our custom
"We were due to depart 9 June on package tour to Crete. Was cancelled by TUI and when I contacted them by phone, was told to wait for four weeks. Not heard anything from TUI since so tried to phone this morning and gave up after being kept on the line for 30 minutes. My 3 payments to them were made by different methods, PayPal, debit card, and credit card. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"They seem to have gone underground :( nothing being answered now, refunds not being paid, I've reported to the CMA."
"I got a full refund in May. I had received an email from them saying the flight had been cancelled. buried in the email was a phone number. I was on hold for 50 minutes, but I got through and was dealt with quickly once I got a human. Full refund was in my account 5 days later."
"Thank you, I’ll have another look for a phone number on my refund email."
They are about advertising new holiday though! May have to repost them too.
"Lots of people who booked in store and paid by various means (direct debit, paypal etc) are having issues with refunds.People who booked online and paid by credit card have had much less trouble.Maybe the way people book and pay for their holidays will change after this.For the people phoning TUI:There IS someone on the end of the line, you need perseverance."
I recieved my refund yesterday. Less than a month after I recieved my credit note
I recieved mine yesterday within the 4 weeks they stated after I recieved credit note
I lost hope on getting any refunds at this point. I'm just considering my money as a contribution to those in the airline industry whose jobs have been affected during this time.
"Ben c, i hardly think that statement is going to help anybody.All of our lives have been affected by this.And as for your money being a contribution, well you must have plenty of money in the bank.Some of us dont have that luxury!!!"
"Ben cWas your booking with TUI?If it was and TUI cancelled, you should get a refund.If you didn't have a booking with TUI, this is a thread about refunds from TUI.People will get refunds from TUI if they are entitled to a refund.It's just unfortunate that for some people it's taking longer than they were told it would take."
My daughter received her refund this morning so I hope this gives some hope to people still waiting.
"Further to my previous posts I have had my money refunded in full, as promised. It was done over the phone yesterday and arrived into my bank account a few minutes ago.TUI refunded to my debit card as this was how I originally paid."
"Hi my money is not a contribution I have worked hard for it to take my holidays.we were due to go to jamiaca in sept we know it as been cancelled.my wife rang tui,we will not get conformation that's it as been cancelled until a week before were due to travel.then apply for refund."
"Ben c's location is New York City so I think it's unlikely that he had any booking with TUI.I don't know the USA laws on refunds but if you have a holiday booked with TUI and TUI cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund.Some refunds seem to be quick, others are taking a long time."
"Registered my request for a refund, received email stating would take upto 28 days, 28 days are up today, no refund, tried phoning , waited 30 mins listening to pre recorded drivel about how busy they are and then got cut off after 30 mins waiting. How do you contact tui, they say visit the web site but no mention of refunds , just want me to book another holiday with them. NO CHANCE"
Nigel WYou contact TUI on the single phone number they give out on their website.Have you received your refund credit code?
"Finally got through, 28 days means 28 working days so has gone from 4 week to 5.5 weeks. Should have said that on email. Will see what happens at the end of next week."
"Update. Coincidence or what. 20 mins after posting above , received a phone call from TUI from a very nice lady who has put through my refund back onto my credit card. Will be in account 3- 5 days."
"I have received the voucher code,rang and requested the monies to be taken off my now existing cruise,was assured this would happen but I’m still awaiting the deduction from my owed balance!"
"disgraceful is not the word, it is worse. We had our cruise cancelled fair enough. I had an email from TUI saying that I had to wait for my refund code, so far so good, received my code a few days after our due depart date, GREAT. went online after a few days went on TUI site followed instructions to get refund. on the refund page usual, name , booking no. and depart date , confirm and all your details come up, once again GREAT, typed in my code did the I am not a robot then confirm, back it came, telephone no. incorrect, but you cannot alter it. so I checked all my booking details and that has the correct number, so my conclusion is it has been altered so I am unable to get my refund. Rang their London number went through press 1 several times got to request refund it then informed me due to heavy demand no deal and cut me off."
Hi all again Refund via tui or 1st choice same company? Found out yes Our friends were due to go to grand canaria in sept they had there holiday cancelled due to hotel booked through 1st choice they have already had refund code and money owning will be payed in 28 days Strange that we have heard nothing knowing full well holiday our is cancelled any thoughts from anyone Thanks
"I have sent several emails to TUI without receiving any concrete advice. I live in Spain but booked my holiday to depart from Manchester because it was our golden wedding and we were visiting family before we left and also on our return to the uk. I have received a refund credit and have accessed the on line form to claim my cash back. When I fill this form in with all the same details as per the original booking it rejects the postcode and denies me access. Numerous attempts to contact TUI by phone have been fruitless, getting very frustrated and annoyed with TUI. Absolute disgrace that they can sit on my money all this time ( fully paid for holiday 11th March)."
"""I have sent several emails to TUI without receiving any concrete advice.""TUI are not responding to emails.I got through to TUI at the first attempt.I did have to hang on for 90+ minutes before I spoke to a human.That was on 1st June, just after they cancelled holidays to the end of June.They have since extended their call centre opening hours (for booking online/app)."
"Absolutely dreadful service. Booked my holiday. Took my money. Due to the Corona virus, TUI finally emailed to let me know it was cancelled. I've been on the phone for hours and hours over days and days. Finally get through and the guy informs me that it shows as live on their system! We've waited weeks for no proper information. Phoned the numbers given by this guy. Same numbers I've rung for days, no email responses. I went online, saw the holiday was still live and they want over £2000 as a cancellation fee. I've got small kids. I cant just take this time off since I cancelled my holiday at work!!! Who are these people that they think I can bank roll their bad service? Harsh times, but this is very poor TUI and I'm not convinced you even know what you're doing. Won't ever, in a normal world use you again.I feel TUI have robbed me, not only of the chance to go on a carefree holiday, but my money. They obviously want to keep our money as long as possible but I am not their bank!! I want my money back."
@ reply 657So what did the TUI guy you spoke to say about the email you received from them to say your holiday was cancelled?Are you 100% sure the email said your holiday was cancelled? Because that email sounds odd if they are now saying it's going ahead.When you say you 'went online' do you mean 'manage my booking'?If I had a holiday booked and I was told that it was cancelled (100% sure) I'd stick them out for a full refund.That's what you would be entitled to if TUI had cancelled your holiday.
Our holiday was cancelled in may still waiting for refund been in contact on the phone and in store no joy they told us they had sent refund back to our account but the bank had bounced it back no one from Tui contacted us I had to contact them so frustrating now we are supposed to wait for up another 28 days because they messed up they are quick enough to take our money where is there customer care.
Gave up waiting for them to contact us we then gave up on trying to call tui.Just been in store where a very helpful lady has arranged our refund back to our bank with in five days
"They told me 4 weeks tomorrow is their last day? All i recieved is the 101 pound insurance cheque through the door. I think its disgusting ive tried to ring them cant get through, thwy are in no rush at all."
"Just an update on my refund.Holiday was 23rd May, received credit refund code 3 & half weeks later, filled in online form same day & had email saying it had been accepted & to allow 4 weeks. That was up last Friday & I received & missed a call on my mobile! I managed to get through to Tui Yesterday morning (only waited for 20mins) & lovely lady explained it was the refund dept who would be in touch with me. Lunchtime same day - they phoned again, authorised full amount into bank account of my choice (it was originally paid on a Visa card). She explained it could take between 3-5 working days but it was in my account by lunchtime today."
LeianneTUI were correct.They need to speak to the lead passenger i.e. your husband.It doesn't matter who paid for the holiday.
Hi my wife finally got through to tui this morning after 1 and half hour wait. holiday cancelled sept which we knew anyway money will be back in our account in 14 days. Will have to wait and see.
"If you ring the 020 number and press the buttons as if your booking a holiday. Wait around 1 hour they will speak to you about refund i did it again today to be told they will ring us before tuesday! Then it will take 5 days for it to go in the bank... spoke to a lovely lady for a change who couldnt be happier to help in any way to be fare but yes i 100% will never book with tui again. Lets see how long they take now. Like you said quick enough take the money , dont want to give it back..."
"Noticed about two weeks ago our flights to Madeira for Sept had been cancelled.If you read the T&Cs it says they will be in touch.True to their word, a very pleasant lady rang yesterday.Carried all our flight extras over to the new booking for next year.Paid same price as this year with a taxi transfer thrown in.I've no complaints with how they have dealt with our cancelled package holiday.Rob"
"I'm at a total loss and frustration with TUI. After receicing a cancellation email and contacting them they told me the near £ 3,000.00 paid via direct debit will be refunded in 2 weeks.After 2 weeks and 4.5 hours on the phone and having to listen to a non-UK call centre advising me that 'it has been escalted to the finance team as there are issues with my ID'. When I queried what do they mean ID, they said this was my booking reference, yet to confirm the refund and call I used the booking reference to pass security.I got placed on hold when I asked for more information for nearly 30 minutes, only to be told the exact same thing regarding the Finance Department.I am nowhere nearer to establishing when my refund is going to be paid back, now considering further action as the call centre is borderline useless, very bad call reception, I can barely hear or make out what they are saying and when I do figure it out it is the same speel."
"I have been waiting since 14th March for my holiday refund.I issued a court claim against TUI a few weeks ago. I had an email from a TUI solicitor who said I would get all my money paid in 2 weeks, which didn't happen. However, a few days ago, I was refunded the court claim fee of £105 + interest of £35 on the holiday amount. TUI have now gone past the court deadline to pay and I have now requested a County Court Judgment for the money.I am confident I will get the money soon. For those who are interested, the online court claim is a simple form to fill in.To put a positive spin on it, I see my holiday money as a sort of savings account held in the Recalcitrant Bank of TUI! It is accruing interest of 8% (a figure determined by the court), which is a very good rate.TUI will be charged interest until they pay me back. So, thanks TUI, I couldn't have got that interest rate anywhere else!"
"My next step court claim!! They have again said I’m to wait 7-10 days for my £3,600 refund ! Waited over 2 weeks now! I will be getting any interest acquired! Tui you are a disgrace!!!!"
"""My next step court claim!!""---Have you spoken with your credit card provider first?"
"Was supposed to travel to Fethiye Sensatori on 10 May 2020 and i am still waiting for my credit note which they claim was sent on the day i was due to travel. Despite numerous calls and a promise it would be resolved, nothing. I wouldn't care, i don't even want my money back i just want to apply it to a holiday for next year. I have been a loyal traveller, sometimes taking as many as 3 holidays a year with TUI and even new customers should not have this issue, never mind loyal customers. When you ring in office hours they claim they are even shut now. Anyone else still waiting for a credit note for a cancelled holiday 10 May 2020, or is it just me?"
I I would like to know why TUI took my final payment for my holiday only to cancel it two weeks later and we found out that the hotel we were staying at had decided to close ALL year due to coronavirus. Surely we should get back more money as they never disclosed this earlier.
"dbrownI think I'm going mad, forgive me. Are you saying you want more money back than you paid?"
Why do you think you should get more back than you paid. Tour operators generally notify cancellations in departure date order.Which hotel and how did you find out?
"Refering to dbrown 172 our final payment was taken in June knowing full well it had been cancelled. If we did not pay it we would have lost 4500 but the good news we should have our refund next week.Edited: 2:23 am, July 22, 2020 "
So ive rang yet again today. Tui are saying they are ringing people and they are not they are just sending voicemails saying they have tried to ring and now they are saying we have to wait another 4-6 weeks for a cheque. I will be ringing again once my husband is home to complain about this as its just again them trying for more time!
"We were notified on 2nd July that our holiday (leaving 23rd Aug) had been cancelled. I applied for a refund online and it said it would be refunded to a card I had made two installments on within 3 to 5 working days. When this didn't happen, I called tui and held for over an hour. I got a connection from someone who took my booking reference but then the call went silent and after 25 mins I hung up. I contacted Tui via DM on Twitter who, after 48 hours, replied and said that refunds are taking longer than expected and it could be 28 days. Anyway on Monday (17 days after applying for the refund) I received an email to say a refund had been credited to my card for £1400+ it arrived to my credit card account today (Thursday). However, the holiday was £3000 more than this which I paid by direct debit. There is no news on when that balance will be repaid and the balance due according to their email is now Zero?! I hope it is just an error and I don't need to contact them once again."
"Hi, we paid by credit card for our holiday in May. We were contacted at the beginning of July and told we could have a BACS transfer or a cheque Both would take 28 working days. We are still waiting ."
"That is awful , they are not doing well with this situation what's so ever! I for one wont be using them again"
"My September Tui holiday was cancelled a couple of weeks ago, about a week ago I opted for a full refund rather than a credit note and the money was back in my account yesterday."
"Balance came back to my account this morning so it took 22 days (16 working days for the full amount to be returned). I think if people are told this initially then they wouldn't have a problem with it. Its more due to being told 3 to 5 days for a refund and then nothing, which creates phone calls, wait times and frustration from customers. They need to just say upto 28 days for a refund?!"
"Well, you can only speak as you find. Had an email off Tui on Tues 21st July stating they were cancelling our holiday to Cyprus in Oct this year and offering re-booking with incentives or a refund. Went on Tui website Tues evening asking for refund option. I also rang Weds 22nd July to confirm and the money was credited to my payment card the same day. Absolutely brilliant service. Well done Tui."
i got a refund 2 months befor i was due to fly
"I'm glad some customers have been refunded relatively quickly, i.e. within 4 weeks. But many have been waiting months. It seems, though, that TUI are finally starting to get their act together.I received my full holiday refund on Friday, three days after I proceeded to issue a County Court Judgement against them (coincidence or what), or did it finally dawn on them that shelling out 8% interest on my money did not make a great deal of financial sense?Sadly, with today's news about enforcing 14 days quarantine when returning from Spain, we could have a second wave of refund misery."

Tui are now adding you to the list of refunds. Then calling you when there get to u on the list. Asking for card details and refunding direct to your card.
I got an email from TUI.be issuing me a voucher for the amount to use in the future. No option for refund. Sad.
Contact them how..? I find it impossible.
"We've had no problems receiving the refund credit code emails (on two occasions for separate holidays), so there could be a problem with your email service.I would suggest that you check your junk email folder and settings in case the refund credit email has been incorrectly flagged as junk (which can happen)."
"I was meant to have my refund 2weeks ago, but again they were lying.... they said it will go in by 18th July. Fobbing me off everytime I actually get through. They even said “your refund has been authorised” yet weeks later I’m still not refunded!! Every-time I call they lie! Is there any legal action that can be taken towards tui, because the longer they have my money the more in debt I am getting with my credit card!! Soo frustrated and angry with them!!!Edited: 1:40 am, July 30, 2020 "
"""Is there any legal action that can be taken towards tui""Read reply #687."
Agreed. They are a disgrace. They offer no method whereby you can obtain a refund of your original payment. They are hanging on to our money illegally.
"#697That is not the case. Have you looked at their website? Refunds are available, you just need to wait for the refund credit note to be issued. Using the reference number on this you complete an online form if you would prefer a refund."
"Tui have changed how they deal with their cancelled holidays again. I had a holiday with them back in April and also one in October. I got this message in my email for the one in October:""What are my options now?1. If you find a holiday to a different destination that you'd like to book for summer 2020, or you'd like to keep your original package holiday and amend to a later season, you can easily amend. All our holidays are backed by our TUI Holiday Promise, find out more here.• If you amend and your new holiday is more expensive, you'll receive an incentive worth up to £500*, so you can find a holiday that's right for you without worrying about the extra cost.• You have 7 days to amend your booking from when you receive this email. After this, your holiday will be automatically cancelled and you will be sent a refund credit for the amount you have paid for your holiday to date, plus up to 10% booking incentive*.2. We understand that you might not be ready to book a different holiday. If this is the case, you can wait until 7 days after you receive this email, when your holiday will be automatically cancelled.• You'll then receive a refund credit for the amount you have paid for your holiday to date, plus up to 10% booking incentive*, which you can put towards any holiday that's currently on sale up until 31 October 2021. You will receive this within 28 days of your booking being cancelled.3. You also have the option to simply cancel your booking – we'll then automatically refund you the amount that you've paid for your holiday.*Terms and conditions apply.Due to the current volume of change we are dealing with, if you’ve been made aware of a change or you have amended your holiday in the last few days – please just ignore this email.""So I duly went on ""Manage my booking"" 2 weeks ago, cancelled it as per Option 3, which was very easy and no refund as yet, even though it stated 5-7 working days. But I waited almost 4 months for the April holiday refund, so will give them another couple of weeks before I start chasing it."
@ 698Why let the facts get in the way of a good rant...?Or maybe Tom Innis could explain why he's not getting a refund of his original payment.Perhaps he paid just the deposit and decided to cancel (in which case he's not entitled to any refund).

"Ref post 693. That’s exactly the situation that I’m in, cancelled, e mail promising voucher code, message from MD, etc etc.. 6 weeks now and no voucher.I too was understanding and would have taken a voucher. Not now. I’ve chased them by mail, will try messenger, but if I don’t hear in the next few days, it’s a section 75 claim."
"@ reply #702:""I’ve chased them by mail, will try messenger,""You are probably wasting your time.Some time ago TUI stopped emails contact and asked that all contact be by phone. I've not heard that they have changed this. Have you tried ringing?"
I changed my holiday as I was worried TUI might want us to still go Then we would have lost all our money if we didn't go.. It was booked for June. Two weeks later they cancelled it anyway. No chance of a refund then as I had already agreed to change to next June. The holiday was much dearer and after my change they started giving the 20% incentive. After a few more phone calls they agreed to give us this discount. Still making the same holiday with discount £300 more expensive. This is now classed as a completely new booking (so Beware). We decided that we would cancel and lose our deposit. Our insurance is expensive already and feel this year the premium will go even higher. Much better to lose a few hundred and get the rest refunded. Then we can travel when we know it is completely safe to do so and no more worrying if it all kicks off again. Rang them Thursday and I had the refund in my account this morning. Seems if they can charge you £400 to cancel they are happy to give you the rest back. I will travel with Jet2 on our next holiday. They gave a full refund as soon as they cancelled our May holiday. No problems with them and it was they who contacted us. Well done Jet2 . Always booked about 4 expensive 5star holidays a year with TUI. Jet2 would have been our first holiday. After reading all the reviews about people getting really poor service from TUI we won't be using them ever again.
"Booked Paphos leaving 4/11/20 from Glasgow in February 2020, we decided today we are cancelling it for the usual COVID reasons.I checked their website for our dates just now and they do not have any holidays now to Paphos from November 2020 until March 2021.Never been told about this, thankfully not going as we were not prepared to pay the rest this week and risk trying to get it back.So they would have taken our money next week for a non existent holiday, you couldn’t make it up, totally illegal and deception."
Holidays are still available to Paphos from Gatwick. Just checked the Olympic Lagoon. Perhaps it maybe the Glasgow flights that are affected.
"""So they would have taken our money next week for a non existent holiday, you couldn’t make it up, totally illegal and deception.""But if they HAD done that, you would have got a full refund. It's the LAW.It might have taken a while to get your refund but you would have got it.I'm not saying it's right for TUI to do that but you WOULD have got a refund of all monies paid.I guess you have lost your deposit by cancelling it yourself instead of waiting for TUI to cancel.FTR - this is a thread of complaints.I've read lots of reports - and I bet there are many more - of people getting their refunds very quickly. Especially those who booked online or via the app and paid by credit card.Edited: 2:54 am, August 10, 2020 "
I’m still waiting. The only call centre you can speak to is in India and each time you get a different answer. Basically fobbing you off. I am now starting court proceedings. Have always booked TUI but am afraid that won’t happen again. Unfortunately there staff will suffer in the long run but I hope they go out of business
#708I wasn’t aware of TUI having an Indian call centre. When were you travelling and what exactly are you waiting for?
Hi we got our refund today. We had booked to go away September was cancelled roll on next year thou wife was on phone waiting for 2hours until she got through . My opinion once lockdown kicked in everyone jumped on for a refund tui could not cope
I think MontonMatt is confused about TUI having an Indian call centre.Probably another one post rant.
"TUI did have an Indian call centre as I have been redirected to it in the past also they did have a South African call centre which I have also been redirected to when the Swansea call centre was busy. I didn't know that both the Indian and South African call centres were still being used due to Covid. but they must be back in use if MontonMatt was redirected to the Indian call centre.Angie.Edited: 2:52 pm, August 10, 2020 "
Yes I did got a full refund after they offered extra not too this is gonna be around for a long time and anyone who rebooks during non essential travel is gonna have fun getting money back get your money back and wait for normality to return
Tell them you want your money back you will get it if contact is taking too long ring a minute b4 lines open and you will get threw only way to do so
All my calls were dealt with by an Indian call centre.
I have just received a full cash refund for my cancelled holiday to Jamaica on 10th June 2020.
I’ve just completed refund form. Beware- it won’t accept it if done on iPhone (not sure about iPad) and it asks for your 11 digit code which is in fact 12 digits. Took a morning of failed attempts and a trip into TUI shop in town to get sorted! Haven’t heard anything yet so hopefully it’s gone through this time. Awaiting refund.
Yes I received a full refund for my cancelled holiday to Jamaica on 10th June on Tuesday 11th August.
Much improved service from Tui on refund - 1st holiday (Apr) took 4 months to get money back in bank and our next holiday (Oct) took 4 weeks. Hopefully they've got on top of their admin and everyone gets refunds within a reasonable time.
I have had a replacement card from the bank and can not get in touch with tui to update my details for a refund. Will it still make its way to my account. Also how long was you waiting for a refund please. Thankyou
We had a full refund within 10 days of the holiday being cancelled
No my holiday was cancelled in July and still not recieved a refund got half then said couldn’t give the other half due to the bank card we used had expired so had several phone calls and still nothing after promising either a refund or transfer what left onto new holiday we had to escalate to resolved then if nothing atol or small claims court it’s disgusting the way they speak to you on the phone they havnt gt a clue what they are doing
I am still waiting for a refund promised in March for a flight cancelled. They are completely ignoring any attempts to contact them.
