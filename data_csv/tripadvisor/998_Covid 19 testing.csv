We are planning a trip to Bar Harbor in September. Here is my dilema. We will get a covid test before leaving Pa and then are traveling to RI and Mass before arriving to Maine. We will be in RI 2 nights and Mass 2 nights so by the time we arrive in Maine our test will be longer than the requires time. So now what? Do we have to get another test while in Boston? So confused!
https:/…
So we have to get another test when we enter Maine? Might not even be worth it
"I don't know the definitive answer to this. But I would guess the test you take before leaving home is sufficient. I believe the wording is 72 hours before travel. The fact that it takes you four days to travel to Maine may not factor in. If one travels around Maine for two weeks, one doesn't have to retest every three days.And, again, let me remind everyone that no testing is required ""to enter"" Maine. There are no road blocks, no airport screening. The only requirement is to sign a certificate of compliance at your lodging."
"I believe since Rhode Island and Mass are not on the exempt list for testing, you would need a test within 72 hours of entering the Maine border. You can arrange to have a test in York - appts necessary ahead of time. Bonnie is correct that you don't need to test every three days in Maine, but you DO need to test before you cross the border.Numbers in Maine are increasing and we are seeing some tourist find out they are positive after their arrival so best to get a test before you come. It's pretty easy to get a test in Mass or so I've heard."
I am going to check with my lodging to see what they advise! I don’t see the need to keep getting tested. Thanks!
"You also need a negative test within 72 hours of arriving in Massachusetts and there is a $500 fine there for non-compliance. Penn is not one of their exempted states. So your best bet is probably getting tested on your 2nd day in Rhode Island. Oh wait, currently Rhode Island also requires travelers from Pennsylvania to arrive having tested negative.Unfortunately when it comes to travel during a pandemic, ""I don't see the need"" will not be accepted as an excuse in any state.Edited: 2:06 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Tommalley, I know I need a test for RI and Mass. My queation is do I need another one for Maine?"
"""I don't know the definitive answer to this. But I would guess the test you take before leaving home is sufficient. I believe the wording is 72 hours before travel."" What kind of advise is this Bonnie ! You live in Maine read the ""Protecting Maine People and Tourists Amidst COVID-19"" governor directive before posting:https:/…keepmainehealthy""The State will allow adults who obtain and receive a negative COVID-19 test from a specimen taken no longer than 72 hours prior to arrival to forgo the 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Maine. """
"Yes, SwimFan, it's probably not very good advice. But in the grand scheme of things whether or not this family gets a second test after four days of travel seems trivial. The whole system is breaking down. Very sad post here on another thread about North Conway, NH. That's what's already happening here in Bar Harbor."
"phillygal: You got the answer: yes - you need to test again. Right now neither Rhode Island nor Massachusetts is on our exempt list, so we must think they are germier than our state. Early in this post you said that it might not be worth it to have to retest, and I completely understand that. Maybe you can add more time to Rhode Island or MA?Today's Press Herald update on the rise of infections in tourists in the Bar Harbor area estimates at least 35 people from away have identified themselves as positive to the local hospital recently. Their results came after they arrived. As of July 29, no Bar Harbor residents had tested positive. Nonresidents in Maine are now testing at a rate four times that of Maine residents."
"I found this site showing testing sites in MA. You can filter by ""no referral needed.""https:/…"
Things may change by the time we get to Maine because this is the first day Pa recorded NO covid deaths! I will just keep up with it on the site you mentioned. Thanks!

Really? Thats crazy! You would think they would be happy to have tourists!
"That's totally not true here in Bar Harbor. No one is being harrassed by locals. Also, most of our Mass guests have been tested and have received results back in 24 hours or so."
"""Numerous reports of out of state people being harassed, reported, and refused service by locals. ""Can you point us to these reports, please? I would imagine that people not wearing masks and not keeping their distance are being refused service, yes. And I would hope they're being ""reported"", too...but I've heard nothing about this."

Happyhiker what do you mean??Op waa just quoting you!!
So you actually don’t need a test then ? I’m confused. Then why is everyone saying where to get a test ? I just want to clear that if it is required or not ? Who is going to ask for the test results ? We will be traveling from Ohio to Boston by plane. Then renting a car and driving to Maine after spending a few days in Boston and Cape Cod.
My friend who is in Mass now said there are just some hotels that won’t rent to out of staters but most don’t require anything. I am confused too but going to call my hotels I have booked two weeks before arrival to clarify!
Linda I would suggest you call the hotel you are staying at to get a difinitive answer. Too many naysayers on my post!!!
"Happyhiker: If we were to cherry pick, your city of Worcester would be banned for sure. Worcester's own official site says as of their 7/31 update:""This week’s numbers, like the week prior, indicate a substantial increase in the number of new COVID-positive cases in Worcester, and represent a concerning trend in the wrong direction. As temperatures have warmed, and more and more people venture outside, the risk for increased spread of COVID has grown. Additional testing is also likely to reveal higher numbers of positive cases.""""There are 5,502 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in the City of Worcester, an increase of 88 over last week’s update on Thursday, July23."""
I just called my hotel and they said you must wear a mask and sign a waiver. That is all! We plan on being outside for everything anyway so in spite of the dire warnings by some folks we are going!!!
"HappyHiker, your statements are just plain wrong, according to the Bar Harbor visitors site. Quarantine doesn't mean what you are saying at all, especially about hiking (see below):Q: What does quarantine mean?A: During quarantine, a visitor may not interact with others outside their travel party or go into public spaces like shops and restaurants. They may go outside for recreation in uncrowded areas provided they abide by physical distancing guidelines and avoid contact with other people. For example, if you can do the following a safe distance away from other people, you may:go for walks and hikes in uncrowded areascanoe and kayakbike on uncrowded trailsswim in lakes, ponds and riverstake a scenic driverelax and take in the viewsget takeout and delivered meals"
"phillygal,Here is the waver - actually the Certificate of Compliance for Maine Visitors you have to sign at your lodging in Maine:https://www.maine.gov/decd/sites/maine.gov.d…The certificate requires one of the following be true before entering Maine:""I certify that ONE of the following is true(PLEASE CHECK ONE):I have received a negative test result for COVID-19on a specimen taken no later than 72 hours prior to my arrival, consistent with Maine CDC guidance.ORI will quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Maine or for the duration of the stay;ORI have completed a14-day quarantine in Maine prior to my stay. ""Based on your statements here will you be truthful when you sign the certificate of compliance at your lodging?Edited: 12:03 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"Doesn’t get take out mean you’ll have to go in the restaurant to pick it up? Is that ok? I am worried that grocery shopping isn’t allowed. Not sure how to pack food for a 12 hour car ride, along with two dogs and the rest of our stuff."
"#29 - I don't understand why ""get takeout"" is on the list because it does include interacting with another person which is not allowed (unless you can go to the restaurant in your car and they do curb side delivery - I don't know if that is offered anywhere). Delivery can be contactless so it makes sense that it would be ok. You are correct that going grocery shopping is not allowed.If it were me, I would be trying to get a test instead."
"Wal-Mart does curbside, contactless pick up in Ellsworth. You have to order online and choose a time and date several days ahead. Side Street Cafe, a popular yummy restaurant in Bar Harbor, will bring your order to your car. Or at least they were doing that before the village got so crowded."
It’s I’ll be getting a test but results take 4 to6 days.
Is the 72 hours from you get the test or from when you get the results? Its kindvof weird they requirevit bc I just saw on the news the results sometimes are inaccurate so whats the point?
We are renting an Airbnb. Who do we give the test results to ?
Linda L - You do not actually have to give your test results to anyone. You need to sign the waiver/certificate of compliance that you had a negative test result within 72 hours or you are quarantining in Maine for 14 days. You then give the certificate to your host.
"phillygal: I get it. Everyone needs a vacation at this point, and a lot of us are suffering from covid fatigue. Maybe your hopes will come true and things will change enough in one month to eliminate the quarantine and/or covid test, but I highly doubt it. And yes, some tests are inaccurate, but that's no reason to eliminate the requirement. (Remember - you can quarantine for 14 days instead if you really don't want/trust the testing.)Your plans include MA and RI, then Ogunquit and Bar Harbor. That's a lot of traveling around and lots of chances to encounter the virus after your initial test in PA. As you have also posted on the Boston forum checking on their visitor regulations, I sense you are trying to do the right thing. I think what would probably be best is to focus on one area to visit, test in advance of that location and stay put when you get there."
Thanks southernmaine. When we go we will be doing all outdoor activities wearing masks and social distancing as we do at home and it will be nice to see some new sites. We will make a final decision in 2 weeks!
Southernmaine what stops would you suggest eliminating?
"""results are sometimes inaccurate so what's the point"" The point is that Maine had 5 new cases of coronavirus yesterday while South Dakota, a smaller state with a llower-density major city, had 20 times as many. Whether it's masks or distancing or the testing, something's working so let's all co-operate rather than whine."
"Tommalley I really don’t appreciate your comment on my post. I am NOT whining, only trying to get information. Please keep your negativity to yourself."
"#36, If #33 is following the rules, I think you're over stepping by telling #33 to drop part of her plans."
"Phillygal - I'd head to Maine and spend your vacation there. It's the travel between states that can get difficult, as things are changing daily. As mentioned, both Rhode Island and Massachusetts are experiencing an increase in cases; as a result interstate travel between the 2 has recently changed. You used to be able to enter MA from RI without restrictions; now, you would fall into the category requiring a test or quarantine.If you just have one state whose requirements you need to meet, you can focus on that one state. There is so much to see and do in Maine - from the sandy beaches on the southern coast, to Portland, to the quaint village of Camden and then Acadia National Park - much to see and explore... it would be a wonderful vacation without needing to worry about possible changing requirements between multiple states.I wish I could be more optimistic, but with the current trend in case increases along with children returning to school next month and colleges re-opening in Boston, I'm not hopeful that we'll see case counts decrease significantly or that well see any relaxation of requirements for out-of-state travelers (at least here in MA - can't speak for RI)."

"RandallVA: Technically, she isn't going to be able to follow all of the rules for all of her stops, which is why I suggested eliminating some. With stops in MA and RI, the 72-hour window for her test would expire before reaching Maine. She would also have to quarantine for her MA visit, so another set of rules.Southiegirl gave a great answer. But only phillygal can decide which area would be her preference."
CB48: Apologies I failed to notice the two nights in each other location. I assumed one night in each...so you are right.
"Phillygirl -- In response to your question in Post # 33 about the timing of testing, the language in the lodging certificate says: ""I have received a negative test result for COVID-19 on a specimen taken no later than 72 hours prior to my arrival, consistent with Maine CDC guidance."" So the test needs to be taken within 72 hours of arrival (with the result arriving between then and arrival). Many folks have had problems getting results that quickly because other state's testing has not kept up with expectations. There is a hybrid-type solution which is helping some people and is permissible under the Governor's Executive Order: get the test within 72 hours of your arrival in Maine; come to Maine and quarantine until your test results arrive; then go from there.Edited: 11:35 pm, August 07, 2020 "
Southie girl we are going to do just that! We talked it over and totally agree with you so will be canceling our plans to visit other states. So here is my final question: If we take the test in Pa and enter Maine with negative results will that test be acceptable the whole 10 days in Maine?
""" If we take the test in Pa and enter Maine with negative results will that test be acceptable the whole 10 days in Maine?""Yes, 72 hr previous or less test, read Post #8; it details the requirement plus a link to the State of Maine COVID site which by now you should have read. Post No 27 gave you the actual text of what you will be adding your signature to at your lodging. There need not have been 50 posts to answer your question. At first you refused to listen. If you had any additional questions you could have gone to the State of Maine's COVID site !Edited: 9:00 am, August 08, 2020 "
Wow sorry to be a burden! I thought these forums were suppose to be fun and helpful. Jeez sorry you are so righteous. Get over yourself
"OP,The point is the answer to your question is on the State of Maine's website which as I indicated was provided early in this thread to you. Best to go with the official information than to continue to ask strangers on a forum where you may receive inaccurate information. That is why I provided you with the link plus the actual document you were to sign upon arrival, all from the State's site. You should continue to monitor that website for any changes prior to your travel date.Edited: 9:25 am, August 08, 2020 "
