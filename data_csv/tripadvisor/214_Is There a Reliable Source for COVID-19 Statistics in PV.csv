Is there a reliable/credible source for COVID-19 statistics in PV?Gracias
Yes a good source is Pam Thompson - Webb at Healthcare Resources. She posts what stats are available. There is a thread started farther down the forum page of the latest from Pam. You can also find her on facebook.
"Hi could you give me a thread for Pam I’m not on Facebook, thank you"
"This is the link, which I also just bumped to the top of the forum page.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15079…"
"Timothy, the best stats I see thus far are for state of Jalisco, not broken down by cities. Have yet to get any stats on Puerto Vallarta, only Jalisco."
"Hmm. There are no stats on that link, which was last updated on March 26th. So, .... does anyone have a reliable source for Covid-19 stats in PV? Thanks."
Pam Thompson Webb on Facebook.
"https://coronavirus.gob.mx/click on ""Datos"", once the country map appears, you can click on states and then cities within states."
"All Mexico Covid-19 Info has only one source:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/All State Government Health Agencies upload their data daily and it's published at 19:00 Mexico City time (GMT-6)I personally read English Updates at:https://bing.com/covid/local/mexicoHead count for the City of Puerto Vallarta does not exist. The closest you can get is by Municipality, which in the case of Puerto Vallarta is considered Municipalities of Puerto Vallarta and Bahia de Banderas, Nayarit. The best local source for the most recent updates is:https://m.facebook.com/SaludJalisco/…I was able to retrieve the most recent update for the Statebof Jalisco in this infograph:https:/…All other sources are either translations or opinion. If you'd rather read what Pam publishes, here's her FB:https://m.facebook.com/pam.thompsonwebb…"
A friend in PV shared this site with me when I asked the same question. https:/…estados.html
The Spanish papers are usually ahead in giving information. I frequently use the Tribuna.https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/jal…
Thanks WWW8 for the information source. Unfortunately a lot more cases and deaths for the area than we would be comfortable encountering right now. Waiting for things to get better...
"I checked the link you provided, but it does not say what the figures are for infections of Covid-19 in Puerto Vallarta. I'm booked for a holiday Dec. 24-2020-Jan. 7/2021., & hope it comes to fruition, but if the latest blogI've read is accurate, it says PV has very recently experienced a 50% hike in infections, to the tune of a few hundred thousand. If you can do so, would you please provide me with a more accurate site where I can get the information. Thanks so much!!!"
"According to the WHO, the entire country of Mexico has around 250k cases."
"Mexico 245K cases - 29,843 deathsPuerto Vallarta 6,396 cases - 636 deaths"
So Mexico is much safer in terms of deaths and cases per 1 million population than the US (although they are conducting far fewer tests). Seems safe to go there except for that dreaded flight on the airplane.
Vallarta Opina and Pam Thompson.
"JNS strikes again...man... you're something...how did you end up being a destination expert is beyond me...the numbers for Puerto Vallarta are wrong, maybe you meant Jalisco, the state that has a population of 9 million... here's a reliable source... https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/jal…"

can some reasonable people at TA take the destination expert designation from someone who post such wrong info about the destination he seems to be an expert in ?

Instead we get ""trust me"" numbers from ""travel experts"" without any clue as to the origin.https:/…mxIt's not PV-level specific, sorry, but you can compare a few of your favourite countries. I suggest looking at deaths, not ""cases"", as the latter numbers go up with more testing, and can include false positives."

"Dugfir...this is where you're wrong...most transmission happens from people who socialize without a care in the world, not from disciplined people who wear masks and sanitize often...hence my remark about connecticut which has almost 50K cases so far for a population that is less than guadalajara..."
here's a very good source for statistics ... https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/

"Excellent source, #29.And very telling. According to the second chart, new cases have practically stopped. Notice the flatness of the accumulated-cases line for the last few days. Good news.Edited: 11:24 am, July 05, 2020 "
"Tripadvisor Covid-19 Guideline: We will remove any content that encourages people to ignore government guidelines or restrictions. drtricia has repeatedly encouraged people not to wear masks based on her/his political bias and is a subjective opinion that goes against government guidelines in Mexico as well as the US.This is not a personal attack of your opinion, no ones knows your medical credentials, or if you’re a doctor or not; but you do manage get you’re political bias across, there is no reason for this to be continued or allowed. It is also shared by others who share your same narrative and irresponsible. If Bruce et al restaurant owners cant list theirs menu items or nightly specials on the forum to promote their businesses, this should not be allowed as well.Edited: 2:08 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Thanks for the chart Alunelu. Gotta think back to when the beach and restaurants opened up? I think it was mid June. So it will be interesting to see what happens over the next week or two as more people are out. Mexico doesn't record covid cases from private hospitals and private labs. However there may not be a great deal of private hospitals that take covid patients, but there must be some. I've read this in several articles about not including those numbers in the Mexico stats....but here's just one place...second paragraph. https:/…"
"Yes, post #29 lists the government website. It is updated every evening just after 7pm when the national press conference is held. Puerto Vallarta stats can be found by clicking on the map. As of last night a total of 601 cases and 71 deaths. But please note, that it doesn’t include the private hospitals. As of July 2nd, the active cases including those, was 914 cases."
"Thanks for the website link and useful info #29, 33, 34Edited: 12:32 pm, July 05, 2020 "
lovemex...where did you get the number of 914 active cases in vallarta ?...that is very high and i think it's wrong...
the actual number is around 60 active cases...
"Alunelu - I think you are correct. I only see 601 confirmed cases (cumulative) for PV, with a maximum daily increase of 20 cases. Active cases is currently shown as 60 (estimated).Edited: 12:54 pm, July 05, 2020 "
Wait. What? Is it 60 or 600?
"Also for consideration, this quote from Pam Thompson on the Facebook group...Vallarta :The Real Deal ...Pam Thompson-Webb ""I believe the death numbers run several days behind. Just because some one died on for example Monday, that will not show in the numbers on Tuesday. Depends on time of day, weekday or weekend, amount of time it takes to process paperwork by family, administerio público and the funeral home."""
"Sounds about right, Kansas. Even here in the states, mortality numbers can come in batches, not always in real time."
KC...please open the links...nobody said 600...we said 60...twice ... https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/
"Sorry. My bad, Sister Mary Grumpenstein"
"in response to the OP, i truly do not believe such a thing exists - sorry to say. But i would bet my last dollar that the numbers being reported by tons of different sources are understated."

"#30 , I agree a destination expert shouldn't spew out obvious political bias and attack people and their qualifications when they know nothing about them, I think that person should take their name off of the destination expert category , or TA should do it."

"Just one question to put things into prospective.......Would you let any of the posters on here give you medical,advise, prescribe medications, even do a surgery? I was hoping not!! Then why worry about who knows what and the constant bickering about who's the expert! Most are in their ""I know it all"" fantasy world. And some that like to make it political views. One should, change the picture from a monkey on the head, to a donkey on the head. Spend some time and actually look up reliable sources for your information. A good start would be to see the information, and charts etc. that Tricia Lyman posts on Facebook group...... Puerto Vallarta: Everything You Need Or Want To Know. Gives you a very good perceptive of what's going on in all of Mexico regarding the virus. Just saying"

"""https:/…w6653'........what a lack luster sugar coated vanilla explanation of almost nothing. Does not bolster most opinions on this topic."
tansandy the problem is it doesn’t bolster your political narrative ... it’s funny how you and others have no problem with politics mentioned on the forum as long as it aligns with yours.

I Google “Covid 19 Puerto Vallarta” to find information. Here’s the latest from that search:https://tribunadelabahia.com.mx/noticias/pue…
Kansas...Great info! Thanks so much.
"#59 - Kansas, I read that forum & haven't seen discussions about politics or a lot of opinions about wearing masks there (in The Layover Lounge). It's more a food, wine, hobbies type of forum for light-hearted topics.Edited: 12:05 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"I think it's worth repeating the link from post #29:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/The second chart in particular is amazing. Data for the last 7 days shows daily cases plummeting to almost zero. (There does seem to be a weekly ""pulse"" to that data, but the last pulse sure looks like a dying one compared to the others.)Since PV is part of Mexico, when Mexico's case count drops to zero, so does PV's.I would love to see a non-cumulative chart of hospitalizations or deaths (the curve we were supposed to flatten: done?), but haven't found one yet. Cumulative is a way to make things seem worse, and simple ""cases"" may include false positive tests.BTW, here's good news for the US (see first chart at each link):https:/…index.htmhttps:/…excess_deaths.htmThese are all data sources I would trust.Edited: 12:21 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"PS, I realize that reporting lag could account for the encouraging look of that chart (first link), those great-looking last 7 days. But let's keep an eye on it."
Quick update. Beaches were packed yesterday. Not much social distancing and very few masks. Jmo. Masks are important and I believe the numbers we're getting about C19 are way under what they actually are. It will definitely get way worse here before it gets better. Stay safe!
"I think you're right Kevin, it's going to get worse. Here at home we're peaking now and they have mandated masks like PV, but I think more people here are wearing them now with the mandate than in PV. Wish we could join you at El Rio and Moro Paraiso. We're probably going to rent our own vehicle if we go to PV during this pandemic so we can go where we want without the cabs and buses. You call it the covid bus, and I call going off my property, ""going into Covid World."""
