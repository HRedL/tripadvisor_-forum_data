"Whilst watching the bourbon st webcam, I am fairly shocked by the total ignorance of many pedestrians walking on the roads with a total disregard for vehicles. I was brought up to know that roads are for cars and the sidewalks are for pedestrians. It was making my blood boil just watching it. I hope the people I run over when I go over in June have good insurance!Edited: 8 years ago "
Good luck with that : )Mind if I ask why you would come so far to get boiled blood?
"um, the streets are blocked off to road traffic for pedestrians....the majority don't care on the intersections where traffic DOES go thru! Wait til you get there and you'll see! Run a few over, and we'll visit you in Angola!Edited: 8 years ago "
"I'm also shocked by some total ignorance, but not for the same reason you are."
"Newcastle-- unfortunately over here in the States, there are some laws that do give pedestrians the right of way when crossing in the middle of the street. If you plan on driving in the Quarter ( which you really don't need to do), then your just gonna have to get over it and deal with it."
If you run over one of em you will be in a heap of trouble. Quit worrying. Come and enjoy your visit.
"Deny's absolutely correct - Bourbon Street actually has barricades put up to stop car traffic in the evenings. Royal Street also has a few blocks that is for pedestrians only all day long. You might want to check the facts before passing judgment, newcastle!"
Once you get here you'll forget you have a car.
"Actually, I was surprised how often drivers in New Orleans don't stop for pedestrians who are about to cross *on a crosswalk*. Anywhere else, this would have made me angry, because it was NOLA, I took it with a smile. Newcastle, you should have gotten out of that car and said hi. :)"
"If you run someone over here it's likely you're the one who's going to have to pay, not them. While I do my fair share of honking, jamming the brakes, and swearing (with the windows up, of course) when tourists dodge out in front of me in the Quarter, it is what it is and there really isn't any changing it. You have to be a very defensive driver in the Quarter or it'll be easy to get into a snarl with another driver or a pedestrian - It's not a fun place to drive. On the other hand, it's also often necessary to become an aggressive pedestrian when walking in the Quarter. If you absolutely don't HAVE to drive, don't. I park the vehicle and walk wherever I need to go.I've traveled the UK extensively and know that if you value your life, you don't DARE play chicken with traffic, so I can understand where you're coming from. It's just not that way here in New Orleans."
"Woah, I was just kidding, sorry guys"
"Of course I wouldn't plough through crowds of tourists, I guess I found it odd that watching the cam, the pedestrians were walking the ROADS as if they were sidewalks with what appeared to be a total dissregard for any traffic, I guess this may be a little frustrating for the drivers.I certainly don't plan to drive much in the quarter only when I visit Nottoway Plantation and Cajun Encounters. I appologise if I offended anyone.Ccolor.....I'm sorry but I was commenting on what I saw with my own eyes, no facts to check. But thank you.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Again, I apologise for upsetting anyone."
"This really is a good topic, drivers in NO, many of whom are from somewhere else, drive pretty aggressively when it comes to pedestrians. Always remain alert. And Newcastle, remember when stepping off the curb, to glance to the left, rather than the right to avoid being smashed by a bus."
"ncblok, I said the Angola thing tongue-in-cheek...no problems with what you said. Fact is, both drivers and pedestrians can be ignorant, regardless of where you are (it's a worldwide epidemic!:)and don't get me started on bicycles!"
"The French Quarter is one big frustration for drivers, from lack of parking to tourists walking in the middle of the street to mules/buggies who refuse to let cars pass to pedicabs to.... you get the point. You just have to take a deep breath and dodge all of those ""potential contacts"" and take it easy!"
"Newcastle - In reading your OP it sounded like you had only seen the issue over a webcam, not in person. I didn't remember that you had actually been in the Quarter or I wouldn't have stuck my nose in. I'm sorry back to you."
"and while we're on the topic...to further elaborate what CajunWave mentioned...those delivery truck drivers that keep the bars and kitchens stocked for us tourists deserve both combat pay and medals! Man, they have a tough job! Especially with those huge trucks on such tiny streets, and evertything else CW mentioned! Hats off and thanks to them!"
"ccolor, sorry for any confusion, I have ONLY seen this issue over the worldcam on bourbon street, that's where my op was based on. I was making the comment, based purely on that.from what I saw, I was kinda surprised that there aren't any accidents involving pedestrians. I'm sorry if, my OP came across as ignorant or aggressive. I'm sure things are totally different in person, but hen you watch that cam it's like watching a version of ""frogger"" for those of you that can remember it."
"LOLOL!!! I've never thought of it like that, but will also never think of it any other way from now on. Thanks for the laugh this AM!!!"
"""frogger""?????"
Frogger is an old video game where you tried to get your frog across the street before it got smashed. Way back to Atari days.Pretty funny NewcastleEdited: 8 years ago 
hmmmm... how did I miss THAT game?!?!? Sounds like fun!
"I was thinking the exact opposite out front of Lafitte's Blacksmith shop last week around 10pm ""who the hell tries to drive down Bourbon on Mardi Gras?"". Man, the shocks on that taxi and Mercedes will probably never be the same! The DJ warned them ""that's not a good idea"", but they tried it anyway and the crowd rocked the cars until they bounced!"
"I thought the same thing Jetgurl, who kind of fool would try to drive in the Quarter on Fat Tuesday?????"
I would guess that most of the cars belonged to people who still had to get to work. It was an extremely difficult day to get around via public transport.
"While you may be right Alice, I would think most natives know better how to get to work on Mardi Gras than to drive themselves. Anyway, it's over and a done deal."
I would think the Mercedes was not trying to get to work at 10pm on Mardi Gras.
"It's possible the Mercedes driver was just being foolish, but it could also have been a hospital employee trying to get to an overnight shift at one of the hospitals. My partner worked the overnight shift both Mardi Gras day and night, and while he could thankfully avoid the Quarter, the parade routes were no picnic. I probably have too much sympathy for that."
I suppose he could have been taking all those young ladies to the hospital with him... : ) I think a local would have just gone one block over though.
KC and Jetgurl--Totally agree on that one!
"Ah, that's different then."
"Alice, I totally get where you're coming from! Anyone who's ever worked ""on-call"" for a hospital will get it as well...trying to get to the hospital within call time can make you crazy when traffic is bad...I can't even imagine what it would be like in New Orleans on MG :(While this apparently wasn't the case in the above incident, you still make a good point!"
