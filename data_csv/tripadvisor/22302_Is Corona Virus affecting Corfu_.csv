"It looks unlikely that we will be able to travel to Corfu (Ikos Dassia) in early April due to fights etc but if we did, how affected by the virus is Corfu in terms of shops, restaurants, attractions, bars etc being closed?Are hotels quarantining guests?Is there anything else we should be aware of if the decision about whether to travel is left to us?"
"Sorry it’s not overly helpful, but I don’t think anyone knows what will be happening at that point in Greece! There is no sure answer unfortunately."
As I’m going to the same hotel in early May I will be interested in any feedback on this thread. Thank you.
Does that include the islands? Clutching at straws here!!
Thank you. We are due to travel April 5th.
"Hi Anne Corfu is one of an handful of places with no reports of Coronavirus as yet - we are due there next month ! Our concern even if we are allowed to go is that staff come from the mainland to work there..When we stayed there May and August 2019 we saw staff we had met at other Ikos Hotels in Halkidiki. Thessaloniki has cases. We feel in limbo as until our fate so to speak is decided by the FCO we will either have to go or lose our money. Watch and wait is all we can do. The Greek government may even ban us from going with cases rising rapidly here.Edited: 12:33 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Should have read 2018 we stayed there.
"Let us be honest the stable door cannot be shut the virus is out there and will be eventually everywhere. I am 70 but will visit Corfu this summer but as soon as the first visitor arrives the nil point on covid 19and Corfu goes out of the window. Let us hope that when the hot weather comes it goes into a dormont stage and during this time a antidote can be made(by the experts) to give us imunity. If they cannot the population of the world must go through it and form antibodies of their own if we can?Edited: 1:37 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Whilst I don’t want to sound like doom and gloom; people need to consider if they are in the high risk group. If you arrive, develop symptoms and become critical, there is little ICU/vents, etc on the island."
The government has announced temporary closure of all seasonal hotels and accommodations until 30th April.
Yes arillas is correct in letting forumsters know that there is a full.closure of hotels and apartments from 23 march to 30 april
I wouldn’t post anything less than correct ;)
Interesting do you have a link please to this ? Thank you .
"At present the only links I have are in Greekhttps://www.taxheaven.gr/news/47758/apagorey…I’m sure it will translated on Enimerosi soon...https://enimerosi.com/enEdited: 6:30 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Thank you - I had a thought that some staff we know in Halkidiki might post and they have on Facebook so I could translate it albeit loosely. Very sad for all the people in hospitality in Greece and around the world. Hope we now get to Kos in October.
All seasonal hotels and apartments will be closed until 30.04.2020
Arillas xx a very trusted source of info x thank you xx Hubby was due to fly 26 april for a four day break. As yet ryanair have not cancelled flights to corfu but i suspect that is the next news we hear from them.
I live on Corfu. Yes hotels are closed until at least April 30th. I was going on a trip back to UK soon but I'm forgoing it as I don't want to bring anything back here.
Why not until the 23rd?
"I'm meant to be flying out 19th April for the Summer.. If my flight isn't cancelled and I'm well, would it still be ok to go do you think? I'm with Airbnb."
Just read on another thread that Airbnbs are included in the closures.
"I own an AirBnb apartment in corfu and I informed my booked guests about the closure and suggested they cancel and reschedule if possible , after dealing with their airline tickets. I would not be fair to them by not telling them the truth.. everything here of tourist interest is and will remain shut. I'm also sure that Easter festivities will be widely affected if not 100%.. Health comes first !"
#24. New directive today. Anyone arriving in Greece from abroad will be quarantined for 14 days.
"Hi, my family and I are due to go to the same Hotel from April 11th. Personally, I cannot see us going but will keep reviewing the state of play up to the end of March.Whilst I have not seen the email myself, my wife has received some correspondence from Ikos offering us a ""Credit Note"", which to me is not acceptable if we are unable to go."
"Michael. I suggest you keep an eye on this thread, which will be updated when any new restrictions (or easing of) post April occur.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Just make sure that credit note is valid for a stay next year.Edited: 3:04 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Wondering if there is an update about Corfu . Had booked flights from Athens to Corfu in August and as we were coming from New Zealand with original flight starting on June 30th . As all our flights except this one has been cancelled finding it difficult dealing with airline .
I believe flights will be running then and unless there is a further outbreak I would expect that to be the case.
"International flights to Corfu, are expected to resume on July 1st from many european airports. Countires like the UK are probably going to stay in ""the red"" until July 15th, unless an gagreement is made on ""safe corridors"" between Greece and the UK. Athens and Thessaloniki airports have already opened up on many destinations, with some tests made on arrival and forms with addressses filled in case a positive result comes up. It is almost certain that when flights start bringing tourists by the thousands, there will be cases and authorities are rtying to prepare to handle them . Hopefully , the weather and open spaces will limit any spread to a minimum. Keep our fingers crossed"
I was planning to go to Corfu next month and was wondering if anyone could answer this question. If someone on my flight tests positive for Covid 19 would all the passengers on the flight have to quarantine for 14 days in Greece.
"Kim N...no, there have been a dozen cases where arriving passengers tested positive and they, along with their family - ftiends were taken to the quarantine hotel..nothing to do with the rest of the passengers on the same flight..We read that one person is positive and the whole family of 3-4-5 people has to move to that hotel for 14 days..expenses paid by the greek stateEdited: 5:51 am, August 29, 2020 "
Thank you for your reply. Still undecided whether to travel of not but that was very helpful.
Just be aware some resorts start to close down mid Sept
I usually go to Kefalonia where places close around the 24th. Is it earlier in Corfu?
"I doubt you’ll have any problems in Corfu this September. I think with the reduced season this year, places will stay open as long as they can (if viable to do so of course). Always worth heading for a resort with more than just a couple of tavernas etc though."
