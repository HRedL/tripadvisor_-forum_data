"The sticky is blocked, so I am adding this. Today, Italy, the entire country, was put in quarantine. What does it mean when a democratic country is in quarantine? In Italy, people are asked to stay home.Monuments and museums are closed. Restaurants, cafés and stores are allowed to open from 6am to 6pm. People may not travel from one region to another without a very good reason, ie, work, family, health. France is in Level 2, which means that officially the government is saying there are still a reasonable number of clusters that are being managed, the virus is not yet spread throughout the entire country. Paris is not yet considered a cluster, even though several deputés (congresspeople) and a member of their kitchen staff have tested positive and an elementary school in the 15th was closed yesterday. The government is postponing the declaration of Level 3 as long as possible so that hospitals and businesses have the maximum amount of time to prepare, but technically, we are there folks, even if it is not official. What does this mean for you and your holiday plans? If you have a trip planned to France in the next month, you may seriously want to reconsider, as we are very likely to follow Italy's example and start shutting down first cities, then regions. It will happen very quickly and there is little time to move around in preparation.SO what are the risks if you decide to come? If you do not get ill, monuments and museums will most likely start to close and events be cancelled. It will be easy to score hard-to-get restaurant reservations, but perhaps only for lunch in a virtually empty dining room. There is also a risk of being stuck in France, with the cost of lodging, food and other related expenses your responsibility. Once home, you may be asked to self quarantine for 14 days. If you do get sick, you will be dealing with an excellent, but overloaded medical system that is culturally different from your own. This is far from an exhaustive report, but it's a start."
"i see that u are facing a bad senario , and why u mention only paris? spain and germany neraly the same number of corona infected in france , other european country the number is rising , so that mean all europe will be in quarantee , honestly your post let people go in Panic and believe me everyone is watching the news on daily basis and know the facts , so tour post warning has no mean as we are all adult and we can calculate our risk by our own , if u are afraid then stay at your home"

"As covid 19 spreads many things will may change (or in fact have changed). You may find that your employer may not let you return to work until 14 days self quarantine. You may find that your employer may ask staff not to take vacation until further notice as ""all hands on deck"" will be needed as there are an anticipated higher than average sick leaves or a bigger demand on the system (think health care related). If you have a known exposure (your flight for example), there maybe enforced quarantine on return (ex at an old army base) and all of this must be factored into your decision to travel. On the home front your parents who have agreed to watch the kids may be overwhelmed if the school closes and they have them 24/7. ....just food for thoughtEdited: 5:46 am, March 10, 2020 "
@phreadWhere did you get this information about Madrid being on lockdown? I find that they have closed schools but nothing about lockdown.

"As a rule, I do not like to see discouraging posts on this forum such as this one posted by phread, but she is correct. There are a number of people self quarantined in Paris, I heard this morning that more than one school in the 15th is closed with more to come. Many residents are stocking their shelves in anticipation of disrupted supplies. I have not used the métro or public transportation in more than a week. The situation will likely deteriorate further. Paris is probably no more dangerous than is any other city. In reference to health concerns, Paris is not unlike where many of you live, but residents can prepare in ways that tourists cannot. I could potentially live isolated in my apartment for weeks, not what I would want to do but it would be possible. Few tourists could live for weeks in a hotel room nor would they want to travel to a city and limit themselves to a hotel room. This may not be the time for pleasure travel anywhere. If possible, anyone planning to visit Paris in the up coming weeks should consider delaying their plans until late spring/early summer."

"Thank you Phread. I think some of us who thought things might settle before our travel time comes in the next few months (mid April here) are finding it's going the other way. I was telling someone yesterday we'd likely reschedule until October and they asked ""why will October be any different?"" At this point I don't know; I can only hope for some degree of containment and normalcy by then."
"@Hamlet. China was in quarantine for two months and things are slowly going back to normal now. Europe will most likely follow the same arc.Also, France declared a flu epidemic in Nov, and things arenow calming down, four months later. Take the average, it is reasonable to hope that things start falling back into place before the July summer holidays (but yes, probably make sure it's all refundable....)"

He said this would test the popularity of the investment vehicle, which has only been around since 2017, and has never yet been tested.Pandemic bonds are a type of catastrophe bond, or insurance linked security - an investment vehicle issued by insurance companies, financial institutions and governments - to protect against the costs of a sudden pandemic outbreak.Investors receive a higher-than-average coupon in compensation for the risk that they will lose some or all of their principal in the case of a pandemic.While most catastrophe bonds cover natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones and earthquakes, and are issued by insurers and reinsurers, the only issuer of pandemic catastrophe bonds is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, part of the World Bank.""This Level 3 still has alot of ifs, maybes, potentially, some, partial, etc adjectives.Meanwhile in the States, more people that have tested positive are escaping their self quarantines and going to high school dances, etc.Australians are trending on twitter, something about toilet paper.For some inspirational news.. the two ladies are back posting again from the Grand Princess, yay!"

"Ugh... We are scheduled to fly into Paris next Monday, then connect to a flight to Nice, where we are to spend the next six days. Not sure what to do... I really don't want to cancel."
"I googled ""coronavirus madrid"" and checked the results and I noted that all schools are closed for 15 days but saw nothing about a lockdown. https:/…coronavirus-update.php"
"French_Mystique, yes. I removed that information."
I did see that the number of cases in Spain has soared past France since yesterday. Spain is now #5 and France is #6 but this is a competition that nobody wants to win.
"Not trying to diminish the seriousness of the threat, and certainly it's an evolving situation, but a brief google search shows there are 1,412 confirmed coronavirus cases in France. With a population of 66,524,000 that means .0000212% of the population have the virus."
As it stands a number of insurance companies will not cover corona virus related illness/ cancellation on new travel policies (those policies booked in the past are covered). This again should be factored in when planing a vacation.
Phread's post is one of the most solid I have seen since following what is happening in Europe in general. It is naive to think that given its proximity to Italy and the regular back and forth to say nothing of the rest of the world that France will not be hit hard. Might be wise for officials to act faster than they did in Italy...I live in US and the officials here are really behind. Tourists are just complicating the spread and everyone loses.
"that means .0000212% of the population have the virus.Actually, that is 0.00212%. :-)"
US travel insurance policies booked in the past still don't cover Corona because these policies have 'epidemic' clauses which indicate they don't cover losses caused by epidemics regardless of when the policy was purchased. I am scheduled for April 1 to Paris and my policy won't help me recover any of the several thousand I am out. I can pay a hefty fee to reschedule air travel but I am not sure it will be safe to travel by the end of the year when this rescheduled travel must occur.I was hoping we could go as we have an apartment in Paris that would make the unlikely event of a quarantine not a big problem but will probably have to cancel.
French_Mystique. Yes... very few people are testing positive right now and the vast majority of us will just get the flu. But a significant number of the people who may get ill will require intensive care. All these measures are an attempt to string that out over the longest period so there enough hospital beds and doctors and intubaters for everyone who will need one. People who travel now are probably no more or less at risk in their home countries. The challenges for travelers are do to measures being taken to prevent everyone from getting sick at once.

"Bonjour, hoping for a little advice. I know this is not a cruising board but it's well populated by people on the ground in France so I'm hoping for a little help.I have a Rhine cruise booked out of Strasbourg in early April and I'm going to have to cancel. Croisi Europe is offereing no flexibilty on their cancellation policy so I will lose 60% of the full price as it's already paid. I was just wondering, if France does move to level 3 might they force the cruise lines to cancel/reschedule? How likely is that to happen? I tried reading some of the French language news but I'm just not fluent enough to catch every detail. I have a few days before my 60% loss becomes 75% loss and I'm just trying to mitigate my financial hit. My country put out a ""do not cruise"" advisory so travel insurance might be compromised if anything were to happen so I feel like I have no choice but to cancel.Merci!"
"More ifs and maybes coming from France's president..#CORONAVIRUS France24Macron says EU leaders will take 'all measures necessary' to tackle coronavirusIssued on: 10/03/2020 - 19:30Modified: 10/03/2020 - 19:30French President Macron said on Tuesday that EU leaders had agreed to take all measures necessary to avoid financial and economic instability that could be sparked by the coronavirus outbreak.French President Macron said on Tuesday that EU leaders had agreed to take all measures necessary to avoid financial and economic instability that could be sparked by the coronavirus outbreak. © screengrabText by:FRANCE 24Follow|Video by:FRANCE 24FollowFrench President Emmanuel Macron addressed the nation on Tuesday evening after a conference call with EU leaders on the coronavirus outbreak, saying that European nations will do everything that is needed to slow the disease’s spread. He also argued that “we musn’t give in to panic”, criticising Austria and Slovenia for closing their borders with Italy.ADVERTISINGMacron said EU leaders have agreed to take ""all measures necessary"" to avoid economic instability caused by the coronavirus crisis, adding that ""at the European level we will be more flexible in terms of state aid"" and that countries' health ministers will speak to the European Commission on a daily basis. Nevertheless the French president also reiterated that ""we musn't give in to panic"".Earlier on Tuesday Macron declared that ""we are only at the beginning of this epidemic"", after a surprise visit to the SAMU ambulance service at Necker hospital in Paris. France is the second-worst-affected country in Europe after Italy – which has effectively gone into lockdown to stop the spread of the virus – and Culture Minister Franck Riester and five MPs are among those who have tested positive. Overall, the virus has killed 30 people and infected 1,606 in France.European Council President Charles Michel said much the same after a video conference attended by EU leaders including Macron: ""We stand ready to make use of all instruments necessary."" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen adopted a similar approach on Tuesday evening, announcing that a special EU investment fund will be set up for the coronavirus with €25 billion of funding, with €7.5 billion to be released immediately.Reiterating that “we mustn’t give in to panic”, Macron took aim at Austria and Slovenia for closing the border with Italy, Europe’s most affected country, saying they were making “bad decisions in doing so”.Slovenia on Tuesday said it would close its 232-kilometre (144-miles)-long border with Italy, while Austria ordered a halt to flights and trains to the country that is the worst hit by the virus outside of China. Macron said France, which also shares a long border with Italy, did not yet need containment measures as drastic as those taken in Italy or China, where the deadly novel coronavirus first erupted. ""Today for France, there is no need to go further than what we have determined... we are taking appropriate measures,"" he said. But, he added, ""if tomorrow or the day after there was a reason"" to take more drastic measures, ""we would take them"".Macron said that taking ""disproportionate measures"" when France was ""only at the beginning of the crisis"" would be ""counterproductive"".The French leader emphasised that it was ""much more effective"" to take containment measures in affected regions."
Following this thread (and one other) for my summer trip to Paris. I still have plenty of time to make changes without losing a lot of money. Thank you for those who are doing the research. I appreciate it!
"reneet960 - Though I've created a post and done some research I am by no means an expert and any research I've done has simply been done of my own accord using basic google key words and phrases (sometimes in French). So I'm no more of a researcher than you or anyone else and if you do google searches you should at the very least be able to find the sources where I've gotten my facts and stats. Don't just rely on me or others on this forum to do the research you can do for yourself on-line, and perhaps even better."
"VDeal, if your country has an official ""do not cruise"" warning, the cancellation insurance part of your travel insurance might come into action. Just a thought."
"@VDeal – nobody knows what is going to happen when we go into Phase Three, not even the people who will be making the decisions. They are consulting experts on the subject at this very moment. But, it is very unlikely the French gov't is going to insist you get a full refund. They may not let the cruise run, in which case they would have to cancel on all their guests. If this happens, I imagine they would offer a refund.As for travel insurance and the need to cancel. When I lived in Montréal, they had an agreement with France and my Canadian medical coverage was accepted in France. I do not know if that was because Québec is francophone, or if it was a nat'l program. If insurance is th eonly thing keeping you from coming, I'd look into that...."
"I think it is important to take this post as one persons view. The French Government have not advised people to stop travelling within France. Most health/travel insurance companies will not pay out if you get sick with corona virus. Unless your country has a reciprocal health care agreement. Australia does not have one with France. Nobody can predict what will happen and posting personal views is not helpful to those who need accurate information. There is another post with accurate statistics, and you may like to use official sources before making any decisions."
"Jann, that is an interesting perspective you have. I thought I was the only one seeing or rather not seeing any definitive answer to how far Macron will go with his plans for France.Meanwhile on France24 News today:China allows some businesses to return to work in Wuhan Some companies in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus outbreak emerged late last year, are to be allowed to return to work, provincial officials said Wednesday.AdvertisingBusinesses involved in providing daily necessities can resume work and production immediately, as can those that are key to “global industrial chains” after getting approval, said the Hubei provincial government.Other companies are expected to resume production only after March 20.___________So, Wuhan, the epicentre of Bat Soup and the Bioweapons Virus Lab across the street that made the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (now called COVID-19) discovery in Batman, are gearing back up to almost business as usual starting now through the next couple of weeks... who knew."
"AVT life is going on very normal here in Southern France, and without getting into the politics of this beautiful country, Macron has been sure to reinforce the message about panic. People are still catching trains, buses etc, and restaurants still have people eating in them."
"According to twitter, President Macron will make a televised declaration tomorrow evening at 8 pm.Edited: 8:52 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Jann - I have not implied people should stop traveling within France. I have a trip planned this weekend! I am saying that of people do come, they may have to deal with less activities available and a situation involving quarantine. It is something to consider before stepping on a plane."
be interested to see what Macron says tonight...hopefully someone will post...he needs to be sure that France gets ahead of this virus...Italy did not and everything is reactive with the death toll mounting daily. I hope Macron really is aggressive on this and that may mean some measures that are very unpopular. We will see.
"ATF - I knew about Wuhan. I also know that anyone coming from France and going to China today must spend 14 days in state provided confinement. So yup, things are calming down in China and life is going back to normal, but things are just ramping up in Europe.Today Merkel announced they expect 2/3 of the 82 million Germans will get the virus. That is about 54 million people who are likely to become ill. Correct me if my math is off, but if only 15% get ill enough for hospitalization (the avg in China), that is still 8 million people in hospital. If only 3% (from F_M’s post) of those who get ill actually die, that is 162,000 deaths in one country in just a few months. To understand what Macaron and the French gov’t are trying to do, check out the curve in the link below. It explains exactly why Macron is trying to control the rate of the spread of this virus. https://www.google.fr/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/…Also - Jann58, if you read my post I actually give facts about what is happening in Italy and where we are in France. I then state a likely scenario of what will happen in France. I can not give facts on what will happen because the French gov’t still has no idea. These are not my opinions. I propose a likely scenario based on what has happened in China and Italy. Without going in to detail, I have daily, first-hand contact with what is being decided in China and what the French gov’t is discussing to decide what will be happening in the weeks/months ahead.Keep in mind, as the title of my post indicates, I address the practical implications on travel to France and not health/safety/moral responsibility aspects of it. That info can be found in F_Ms post."
correcting my post above Macron speaking tomorrow night. I did see Merkel's prediction and about the same predictions in US especially hard hit will be major cities with high density. Italy went step by step by step but that simply did not work...close North they go South...measures need to be taken nationwide and enforced...the lax enforcement in Italy and even right now flights are still leaving to go to various countries including France and USA and at least in US airports are not asking questions. Governments need to wake up.

The US has officially suspended travel from Europe for 30 days. The clock starts Friday.
apparently it doesn't apply to Americans just Schengen and other foreign nationals.
"Yes, the ban does not apply to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents coming from Europe. But they will be required to pass appropriate screening. It will be interesting to see how many flights will be operating from Europe to the U.S. during that 30-day period."

Public transport still open.
"Heard most of Macron´s speech tonight. Schools are closing but public transportation remains open. A great deal of what he said had to do with limiting one’s exposure to the virus and helping others; family, friends, neighbors. Government is encouraging business to allow employees to work from home as much possible and for government to provide financial safety nets for those in need. He called for unity and for an enhanced sense of community spirit and empathy for others.Probably the same as what the US president wanted to say but didn't."
Related to travel : Macron said that we can expect travel restrictions within France and across borders. He also said the Minister of Health will be announcing limits as they become appropriate.
"The president also said that nationwide local elections scheduled for Sunday will not be postponed. So get out there in public and vote.However, that is round 1 of voting.Stopping travel before round 2 of voting is a bet with high odds.""unity and for an enhanced sense of community spirit and empathy for others""... I have been in the supermarket everyday and each day this week and not all people are obeying Macron's hopes & wishes."
"Sarastro,I love your optimism about what the American president actually meant to say. I don't think even he knew what he meant to say. Cargo ban? No. Travel ban? Not for American citizens. Health insurance to waive co pays for treatment? No. Everyone coming into the country to be tested? No. Testing is just wonderful?? NO. What a mess. Unfortunately, I don't think you got this one right."
"Could not agree more regarding what Trump said, meant to say and did not say. What a mish-mash of statements and now not even his most able staff can explain the plan. As I understand it ,until midnight today (France time) US citizens and anyone really can get back on any flights operating...after that no foreign nationals etc. and US Citizens face quarantine and other measures (but doubt they even have any protocol in place)....I think the end result is no US Airlines are going to be operating these routes...in fact not many will even bother at all...and UK will be added soon and of course should have been included. I love here in US we have the candidates for president all putting forth their plans and ideas on Covid 19 and they cannot do anything.Edited: 3:25 pm, March 13, 2020 "

It is clear that they operate under the umbrella as a travel agent and a member of Iata but, in fact they are a sham! The way they neglected their anxious clients, stranded on foreign soil, in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic is unacceptable, and will have consequences! I for one, will file a case with the European High Court, who do not take kindly to the fact that travel agent & Airlines abandon their passengers in any circumstances, without providing alternative solutions. This will cost them dearly! At this point I have no idea if and when I shall be able to return to France Please, whatever you do not book with MyTrip, they are a nightmare!!"
"<< The way they neglected their anxious clients, stranded on foreign soil, in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic is unacceptable >>Vuvuzelita, are you more special than than tens of thousands of other travellers trapped in the wrong place? I would be very curious as to how you expect a travel agency or anybody else to transport you from South Africa to Dijon (?) when there are no flights.Do you think that the European High Court has nothing better to do?"
