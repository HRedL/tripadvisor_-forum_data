"Has anyone heard of any problems with the flu in Cozumel? The wife and I are diving May 17-22. Not really worried about dieing from it, just don't want to be/get sick on vacation. Thanks."
We do not have the outbreak here. Mainly in Mexico city and south. 1400 miles away. Texas and California are also a concern as the CDC has reported. 
Lucky for you that you get to escape from the possible swime flu danger to you in Texas and relax safely in Cozumel!
I understand that the CDC stopped short of telling Americans not to travel Mexico.
"Well, we have at least 8 confirmed cases here in NYC (school in Queens)....so Cancun/Playa is looking better all the time."
I'm still a little worried about this - we are supposed to be heading to Cozumel on Friday but have heard that if they upgrade this to an epidemic (I believe thats the one as it's a pandemic right now I think) then they will stop all non essential flights to Mexico out of Canada at least not sure about the US - there are 40 of us booked to go this will really suck if it's cancelled.....crossing my fingers that this won't happen....
I am worried as well. We are leaving May 18. My fear is going from pan- to epidemic status. I work in a hospital and I chomping at the bit to go in and speak with our Infectious Disease Doc.
"Actually, pandemic is the worst one. That means that it is spreading over a wider area, like a whole continent and other continents. Right now it is only an epidemic so far."
"There are no cases at all reported in the Mexican Yucatan, Riviera Maya or Cozumel areas.U.S. Embassy offers advice The U.S. Embassy in Mexico has posted a warden's message to its Web site advising U.S. citizens to avoid large crowds, shaking hands, greeting people with a kiss or using the subway. In Mexico it is pretty concentrated in Central Mexico and at border regions but the USA border states are having the same difficulties.The US Center for Disease Control would issue a serious travel advisory or even limit travel if they were very concerned this had spread or become uncontrollable.* * *""The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens in Mexico that most cases of influenza are not swine flu,"" the message states, urging people to refer specific questions about the flu to a medical professional. The embassy also says it will post additional information as it becomes available at: http://www.usembassy-mexico.gov It also lists contact information for its American Citizens Services, which can be reached at (55) 5080-2000. For after-hours emergencies, it says to call (55) 5080-2000, ext. ""0"", and ask to speak to the duty officer. -THE NEWS "
"Wife and I are going to Riviera Maya May 22. We are bugging out a bit, but I had to explain to the wife that we are only 80 miles from NY, and Playa Del Carmen is over 1000 miles from Mexico City. We are concerned and will continue to monitor the situation. USAir and Continental have both allowed no charge changes to flights into Mexico city. We feel that the US will make the safest call if it comes down to it for total travel to Mexico. We have it in the back of our minds that something is trying to tell us not to go. First, a week after we booked our trip Mexico drug violence becomes newsworthy. Now this. "
"Thanks to all for the input. I did hear on the morning news that the 8 cases in NY are POSSIBLE Swine flu, and MAY have been contracted in Cancun. Nothing confirmed; CDC is supposed to have a report later this am. Thanks for the link, Island Jim. It would have to be very bad for my wife and I to cancel a dive vacation to Coz. We only get there once a year, and look forward to the next year as soon as we get home."
"This is from this morning's news. Doesn't sound promising.NEW YORK (Associated Press) -- New York Gov. David Paterson has directed the state Department of Health to monitor and respond to probable cases of swine flu.Paterson directed the department on Saturday to mobilize its infectious-disease, epidemiology, laboratory and disaster preparedness workers after New York City health officials reported at least eight high school students were likely sickened by swine flu.City health officials have said they don't know whether the students have the same strain of the virus that has killed people in Mexico.Paterson says 1,500 treatment courses of the antiviral Tamiflu have been sent to New York City.Eleven cases of swine flu are confirmed in Kansas, Texas and California.The CDC has said for years that a flu pandemic wasn't a matter of ""if, but ""when"". Be careful folks."
We just returned from Cozumel on Thursday 04/23/2009. The incubation is said to be 2-3 days. We all are feeling fine!! Had a great time.
"As of today, there haven't been any reported cases in Cozumel or in the entire state of Q.Roo!"
"From the CDC's website:""CDC and state public and animal health authorities are currently investigating 8 cases of swine flu in humans in California and Texas that may be related to cases in Mexico. At this time there have been no severe illnesses or fatalities seen in the United States.To date, there have been no reported cases of influenza-like-illness in the resort areas along the coast of Mexico.""…cdc.gov/travel/contentSwineFluMexico.aspx"
"Seriously..... a few cases, that are NOT confirmed that they came from cancun....this is so over-media hyped! Dont cancel because of a few cases....these kids could have touched something in the airport that someone from Mexico city touched...and then they all shared drinks in .....practice good hygene and dont lick anything on the airplane or in the airport.....no kissing strangers.Don't let the media ruin your fun./....I am soooo tired of the media over stating things and making everyone freak out....we give them soooo much powerLP"
"I can see the no licking of anything on the airplane, but no kissing strangers?? What am I gonna blame on the tequila?"
"you can still lick the strangers, just make sure that youve both had enough tequila to kill the bacteria!"
Woo-Hoo!!
Thanks for the comic relief you guys!! Much needed to ease my worries - I think its true what one person said that the media over hypes things - though it is still something to be concerned about and I still am worried about the outbreak and hope that they can contain it! My fingers are crossed that we still can go on our holiday :)
Hi everyone! Leaving for Cozumel on Friday May 1 and can't wait. It has been 5 years. I too am worried about this Swine Flu thing. We have actually scheduled an excursion in Playa Del Carmen and intend to take the ferry over from Cozumel. What do you think? Should we cancel our excursion and stay on our safe little island? I dont want to get sick but at the same time I just want to have some fund and enjoy life! 
"CozDreamer, PDC also seems fine. The biggie is personal hygiene."
"We are leaving on Wednesday and I can't wait. I'll admit that I am a bit worried about the outbreak, but I need this vacation and am not loosing all the money we have tied into it. I just bought a couple bottles of hand sanitizer and some anti bacterial wipes. I plan to use the wipes on the arm rests and tray tables on the plane and door knobs at the resort and just remember no shaking hands without using sanitizer right away. The tequilla will take care of everything else. Everyone have fun!"
maybe it will scare away the pod people : )
Thanks for the response. Im really looking forward to our trip
"Hi John, I feel the same way. Great suggestions with the hand sanitizer and wipes. We will definetly bring those items as well. Hey, we will see you down there :)"
"Pod people? Are they they the ones in ""Night of The Living Dead"", or ""Soylent Green""? It's people...Soylent Green is people!!"
"By all means take the trip to Playa. Heck, a whole lot of people who work in Coz come over from the mainland, anyway, as well as tourists by the boat load, so it isn't like you're isolated in Coz. "
"What about a cruise? We are leaving on May 14 from Miami, going to Key West and then Cozumel...I'm only a little worried. But I don't want to stay on the boat!"
"Mom, my guess is that your bigger concern for catching any illness will be on the boat. Cozumel is not currently reported to be a area impacted by this flu."
"So I leave for Cozumel on May 30th.....and yes, no licking on the airplace and my husband will not allow kissing stranger.....I guess, we are a bit concerned about the flu too.....but why borrow trouble....we can only control what we can control.....if they are not restricting travel, we are going.....GOOD NEWS.....there WILL be some people that cancel because of the threat....it means we will have more of the resort to ourselves.This has solidified our decision on renting scuba equipt here or there.....we will rent here.But it will be less crowsed....good for me.Looking forward to the trip! Dont borrow trouble and only be concerned about what you can control!Looking forward to a fun trip on May 30th to Cozumel Occidental grand.....focus on the good!"
"Oh this whole thing got discussed and over-discussed during family gatherings this wkend as three of us gals in the family are going May 12-19. We firmly decided that near the end of our stay, we will Skype our family informing them that we have been quarantined to the island, all flights out cancelled and ""what, huh? you mean you haven't heard that? We're stuck here, gosh-dern-it""Of course, we'll be equipped with masks so we can send pics back. * Now I'm not discounting what is going on in MX City but let's look at the population vs. deaths, we're talking MILLIONS of people that live there, in fact, one of my very oldest friends is there, where I was an exchange student, jeers and jeers ago. AND, AND, how many thousands of miles it is from Cozumel. *One day at a time. Be smart and be safe in your travels - hydrate, wash your hands (a lot) - good hygiene...enjoy your vacation!"
"According to the National Late news here right now (11:00 PM) there are 6 confirmed cases in Canada, but all are very minor with no issues. Unfortunately they haven't said where the Canadians had spent their time in Mexico. "
"Wineott""Oh this whole thing got discussed and over-discussed during family gatherings this wkend as three of us gals in the family are going May 12-19. We firmly decided that near the end of our stay, we will Skype our family informing them that we have been quarantined to the island, all flights out cancelled and ""what, huh? you mean you haven't heard that? We're stuck here, gosh-dern-it""GOOD IDEA!!!We aren't even booked to go until October, and I still get this ""concerned discussion"" All I have to say, is do as you do every day..wash hands, wash hands, and as far as the ""crime"".. the only crime I see in Cozumel is me spending mucho money (my bad).I should send out an alert to anyone that wants to cancel their vacation to Coz that I will be more than willing to risk the crime and the flu...shoot I do that every day here in the US without the beauty of Coz...If you are still quarentined in Coz in Oct, hope to meet you!!Vanessa"
At this point looks like I would be safer on Cozumel as there are reported cases in Kansas. Who knows by mid May.Question for the experts: Does the medical mask go over the top of your snorkle?
"I have had this vacation to Cozumel booked for 6 months...there is absolutley no way I am going to let the Media scare me into cancelling my Honeymoon. I did have a Type A flu last year..I would have rather gotten it from Cozumel than from stupid work!!! Right now I'm just praying that they don't close the borders..We have already paid for everything, and only 21 more sleeps to go! I just can't wait. And thanks for tips with the antibacterial wipes..good idea regardless of flu."
cozed.. too funny!! 
"With the ""offical"" state issued statement to avoid non essential travel to Mexico, the airlines I have booked with will allow any changes without penalty if your travel is before May 20th. Since mine is mid June, I'm thinking we will have the all clear...well Im praying for the all clear!! I like everyone else dont want to miss this trip, but I dont want to spend my vacation with a mask over my face either."
"I really cant believe how much Ive had to defend this vacation!! First my head is going to get cut off and now Im going to die from Swine Flu!! My family is having a field day, as is coworkers!"
"A vacation is ""essential"" isn't it? ;)"
"cozed - ROFTLtwin - I'm doin' a whole lot of defending here too, let's just go back to talking about the drug violence in MexicoMy husband couldn't wait til I was out of the shower to tell me about the ""warning for non-essential travel to MX""I responded ""define non-essential"""
LOL cozed. good job!
"For me, this vacation is essential! The travel dates that Continental is willing to change w/o penalty are before May 20th. Since Im not going until June 16th..my thought is things will be settled down! Well, my hope is! When my kids got the flu here even after the flu shot, I guess I should have gone somewhere tropical to escape them! "
"My boyfriend and I are leaving this coming Sunday...staying for 7 nights...NOTHING is stopping my trip!! Unless they stop me at the airport!! We just bought a few of the small travel size hand sanitizers, hand sanitizing wipes and we will call it a vacation!! Can't wait!!"
"If anyone is REALLY, REALLY worried about travel to Cozumel just send me your airline tickets and I'll report back to you about the conditions there. And, someday, I'll pay you back for your tickets. I promise! "
Are people in cozumel wearing hospital masks?Can your employer terminate you if the borders close and you are stuck in paradise?
"I've been reading all the posts. I am happy that Cozumel has not been reported for swine flu cases. My mom and her friends left today on a cruise and,one of their stops is in Cozumel. I called her and told her to be cautious since they will be traveling but I don't see her venturing too far away from the dock itself :-)"
"Warden MessageUpdate on Flu Outbreak in Mexico – Center for Disease Control Issues Travel Notice for Mexico; Mexico City Cancels Classes until May 6April 26, 2009 The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) updated on April 26, 2009 a notice about H1N1 “swine” influenza and travel to Mexico. The notice does NOT recommend that people avoid travel to Mexico at this time, and suggests precautions travelers and U.S. citizen residents in Mexico can take to reduce their risk of infection. The notice can be found at the following link: …cdc.gov/travel/contentSwineFluMexico.aspx.On April 25, the Government of Mexico announced that as a precautionary measure, all schools from kindergarten through university level will remain closed until May 6 in the Federal District, State of Mexico, and San Luis Potosi. All government-sponsored events involving large crowds have also been canceled, and museums and most tourist attractions are closed. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City will open on Monday morning, April 27, 2009, but all non-essential services to the public will be suspended. From Monday, April 27 through Thursday, April 30th, consular services for U.S. citizens will be limited to citizenship applications (passports and consular reports of birth abroad, or CRBA) and emergency assistance only. Notarial and other routine services will not be available; anyone with passport or CRBA appointments is encouraged but not required to reschedule to a later date. Additionally, the Federal Benefits Unit is requesting all persons to postpone interviews on Social Security claims. The Embassy’s visa unit will also suspend normal operations during this week.

"My main concern right now is IF I must wear a mask, it is really going to give me some funky-dude tan lines on my face."
"Anyone like me miss the endless discussions during hurricane season we normally have about ""should we go?""BTW- Back two days from Coz and nothing, nada, zilcho. I'm with Hobie, if you want to cancel, I'll buy you ticket from you. Fair price? Almost free."
I BELIEVE THE MEDIA HYPE !!!!! EVERYONE STAY AWAY FROM COZUMEL !!!!!This can be a very serious situation - everyone should stay away - however this will cause an already sad economy to go even further in the hole - so I propose that we give them one of those handy dandy government bail outs ! So everyone send me your hard earned tax dollars and I being the kind and considerate person I am will sacrifice myself and bring it to them personally. I will make sure that Cozumel's economy stays stimulated !!!!! :)Ok - on a serious note it does say on the CDC website if your concerned you can see your doctor to see if you get some Tamiflu as a preventative. But I really like my first idea better !…cdc.gov/travel/contentSwineFluMexico.aspx
"We are leaving for Coz on May 7th... We are all taking probiotics to help prepare our immune system, as well as bringing sanitizer and masks to wear on the air plane ride. Obviously the airlines would not allow travel if they thought planes were incubators for the disease. The recycled air is never good on a plane. Be smart, use common sense and reiterate to your kids to wash their hands often. At the AI's...be careful at the buffets. But most importantly... if worrying about the flu constantly, it will take take away from a memorable experience. ENJOY!!!!"
"According to a live phone call from our Governor Felix Gonzalez Canto at the local News station (Sol Stereo), up to now Monday April the 27th there has not been presence of the flu in the state of Quintana Roo.Lets hope its stays that way and we are taking all preventive procedures to keep it that way even though they might look to extreme its better to preventStay in touch and we will keep reportingAdrian Angulo"
"I appreciate the comedic banter and the legit advice...this whole swine flu thing and the media buzz is a major BUZZkill.Heading to Coz with two great gals on May 12th, STILL walking to get in bikini shape and tanning to prepare my fair MN skin. It is encouraging to hear other level headed travelers are NOT canceling trips!"
"ohhh and by the way, the forgotten precautionary measure to ensure a good trip to Coz...Lock your TV in the closet."
"So if the kids in NYC got it in Cancun, where are the people they got it from? Are they just not reporting it, or are they better without seeking treatment? "
"marina, I was wondering the exact same thing!"
"If I had a mild case of the flu, I probably wouldnt go to the Dr. Im sure many people have the ""reg. flu"" and no one ever knows about it. Besides, in Mexico City, they might not be able to afford to go to the doctor even if they were seriously ill."

"So- saw today on the Melia website that they are sending guests to Cancun and closing the Melia Cozumel for the month or something.
