I am due to go in 7 days. Of course no one knows what is going to happen although so far there has been no spread to a native Singaporean that we know about. Is anyone there right now or has been within recent days? If so what was it like?
"It's not like anything really... I am not wearing a mask and am not concerned about going about my daily business, not do I have any concerns sending kids to school etc. I'm not sure where you're from, but the number of cases here is exactly the same as Australia, for example. No cases of reported transmission in Singapore.Only you can decide whether you feel OK to visit, but I have no worries about it living here. Latest updated here:https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanEdited: 10:51 am, January 26, 2020 "
"Currently it's making very little difference to what people do.A lot more people are wearing face masks than is normal.The chemist in Resorts World has run out of face masks, and won't have further stock until 28th. We saw a long queue there yesterday, but not sure what they were buying.So if you decide to come, do bring hand sanitiser and face masks with you, if you judge them necessary.Also look at this thread for further info https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294…I'm monitoring the BBC https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsfor details about the virus and how it's spreading and how dangerous it's likely to be, and CNA https:/…singapore for news specific to Singapore"
The Ministry of Health site might be of interest to you ... https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhan.
FYI...in case you want to track the cases identified. This is a real-time dashboard.https:/…
Tim J - did you travel to Singapore? How was it like? Any reason to be concerned? I am traveling today.
They just raised the alert level to orange because there are new cases where they can't trace the source. I would review the health ministry website before going.
"I'm thinking of going Singapore in mid / end of March poss start of April gonna see how the situation is between now and a weeks time (yeah I know it's not going to go away in that time!!) before arranging flights accommodation etc.... mean while another case confirmed in the UK said that person got it whilst in Singapore..Edited: 8:46 am, February 07, 2020 "
"I live here and it’s absolutely fine. NB there has been cases of transmission to singaporeans who haven’t travelled to China actually but even so that is 11/30 cases in a country with 5.5 million. It really, really isn’t anything to worry about."
Rastnim.Is there any evidence of “panic buying” I.e. empty supermarket shelves as I’ve read there is somewhere?
"Ive just arrived in singapore and i can confirm to you the supermarket shelves are absolutely devoid of tissues, sanitizer,rubbing alcohol and masks.Canned goods are also depleted.Take it from me panic buying is a reality.Im glad I am leaving tomorrow"
Gosh. The hysteria and panic over this disease is more viral than the corona virus itself.
Only because people are silly and panicking for no reason. They are worried about being quarantined. Doesn’t mean there’s an issue nor that there is a lack of anything - bar masks and hand gel which is the same all over Asia.
"The scare is taking over much of the region. We are experiencing similar panic buying behaviour in Hong Kong and Macau. Supermarket shelves have been ransacked of rice, pasta, canned vegetables, face masks, toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitiser and disinfectants for a week now."
It also brings people who have attached themselves to this forum spreading panic over recent days. A couple of posters we have never seen before are now constantly posting just on the virus threads. It’s not helpful and I am unsure of their motives.
I feel like i wasnt paranoid or in fear before discovering this forum but after reading alot of comments i now am :/
I arrived to Singapore 4th of February.Everything was normal except yesterday 7th February when I spent more than 1hr in row in supermarket.
"I agree Avanti, it is infuriating me. Spreading panic for no reason and some have never even set foot in Singapore!!"
"HIWe are still coming to visit next week.....can't wait!One question......wheres the best satay!!You could catch the Virus anywhere in the world,face masks are in short supply or overpriced in the UK too...See you next Sunday Singapore!"
Just arrived in Singapore as well on a three day 'lay over'. City seems to be on alert and it seems more quiet than we had expected. Some locals told us they felt the city was more quiet because of the virus as well.
@John E. Even though higher priced than other hawker centre I would have to say Lau Pa Sat.
"Just my 2 cents for those who are already here and visiting As much as I love them, I’d be avoiding Hawker Centres right now, at least until the crisis is over. I’d prefer to pay extra for a higher standard of hygiene elsewhere. There’s plenty of apps around where you can get really good deals on food at some great places eg Eatigo, Chope, Quandoo and others."
""" I’d be avoiding Hawker Centres right now, at least until the crisis is over. I’d prefer to pay extra for a higher standard of hygiene elsewhere. ""I did read that the cleaning at Hawker Centres has quadrupled but there was no mention about restaurants doing the same so what info do you have to back up this statement ?The way you have been posting about the Corona Virus im surprised you are even considering eating out. :("
"""Gosh. The hysteria and panic over this disease is more viral than the corona virus itself.""That's it... It's stressing me more than the virus itself, to have to be constantly explaining to hypochondriac Europeans that life goes on as normal, there are precautions and it is important to take them and to monitor the situation, but it's not a war zone! Maybe I should get off the forums...My partner is just off to the supermarket now, I'm wondering what he will report... We saw pictures of the alleged queues yesterday and thought they looked like a normal weekday-after-work day at our closest shop.I'd concede it is slightly less busy out, but you still can hardly get a seat on certain mrt lines even at non-rush hour..."
At Hawker Centres and Food Courts it is noticable that the same cloth is used for wiping multiple tables as well as chairs and hot water is still NOT used for sanitizing cutlery or plates..... Not forgetting that dozens of fingers have poked and prodded the cutlery dispensers before you.It was also photographed and reported on Stomp this week a cook cutting his nails in the open serving area.How about providing evidence that such food handling practices have improved.
How about restauarants etc.... are they running as usual serving usual amount of food etc ? They (like supermarkets) also need to get supplies from somewhere
"Hi MarkHonestly the situation has been greatly exaggerated. There is plenty of food and no shortage of anything other than hand sanitizer and masks. We've done our normal Saturday shopping and bought everything we needed. I can't speak for everyone, but I can say that my family and I have not changed our routine, don't wear masks and attend all our normal activities. We were at a concert today, and while there was temperature checking, I only one or two people wearing masks. At work, no particular changes,and travel still okay except mainland China. We eat at hawker centres regularly (like most of the population of Singapore). It's typical to wipe down the table and cutlery before using it. Incidentally that Stomp picture referred to was our local kopitiam (not a hawker centre or food court).Only you can decide whether or not to come, mine is just one perspective.Edited: 9:20 am, February 08, 2020 "

"Travelling in 13 days for my birthday. Worst case scenario is flights will still run (so we can't claim on insurance), but everything will be closed down; just seen that Specta is suspended indefinitely. Was taking it in my stride until now. :("
"@Desk29As long as we are on Orange alert, personally, I’m not taking the risk of using a Hawker centre. In my opinion I prefer to trust a branded hotel restaurant on an Eatigo or Chope deal for consistently maintaining a higher standard of hygiene. Feel free to disagree.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…If this report is to be believed, then we are now up to 40 cases, up 17% from 33 cases yesterday, and the 17% growth rate exceeds the steady 10% observed in previous days. Each person infected, in turn infects on average 3-4 others, except for “super spreaders”.Also case 2, as quoted:“after onset of symptoms, except to visit Redhill Market and a hawker centre at Bukit Merah for meals.”https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/detai…Case 25: “ ...he had visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre“"
And it also stated he worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive which was visited by the same tour group from Guangxi.Don't get me wrong I believe extra precautions should be followed but there becomes a point where it becomes an obsession. So what if they visited a Hawker Centre ( most Singaporeans probably eat at Hawker Centres than restaurants) it's not to say they contracted it there.
"@Desk29, your choice entirely. Disagree though."
"Like all things that aren’t homogeneous, there will be variances between individual operations. Restaurants aren’t necessarily more hygienic than hawker centres. You can do what you are comfortable with but don’t propagate it as if it is a fact. Viruses are less able to survive in a well-ventilated space.Edited: 11:03 pm, February 08, 2020 "
"At least at hawker centers you can see what is going on regarding food preparation and cleaning.In restaurants you can't see behind the scenes where the food is prepared, and I'd bet that all is not squeaky clean all of the time."
"I am also not making major changes to my lifestyle besides sanythising hands more often. I ate at restaurants, nothing different from usual.The only think scarce in the supermarket last night was toilet paper.The prime minister said stop hoarding, we have supplies. I could feel him mentally facepalm throughout his televised speech :p"

I cancelled my 11 day Singapore home visit trip in March. Managed to get full refund for the Singapore Airlines return flight. Better be safe than sorry.
Can i ask what type of ticket did you have which enabled you to get a full refund?
Did you have a refundable fare? Singapore Airlines currently has no waivers for flights in/out of Changi if Singapore is your destination.
"Singapore airlines have offered us a refund of our perth to singapore to hong kong, hong kong to singapore to perth flights. We arent visiting HK anymore but plan to still come to Singapore but they may change depending on how things progress in the next 10-14 days"
"@ Post #37Instead of making snobbish comments, be more specific on what wrong you see with squat loos and using hand.Edited: 7:59 pm, February 09, 2020 "
"Exactly MRahul, it is subtley racist comments like that that people get away with at times like this. Shows they feel their ways and methods are superior and that these other people are “dirty”."
If I have wear a face mask in busy places santizer my hands etc do you think I’ll be alright ? My hotel has a massive pool so if gets worse I can relax there for a few days !
"Alor you will be absolutely fine. Get out and see the city you have a tiny, minute risk and more chance of getting flu! Which is more likely to kill you!! Also face masks should exclusively be used by the sick with runny noses and a cough not by people who are well. It does nothing."
"Alor, best is not to worry too much and go out there to enjoy yourself, just take the necessary precautions of washing or sanitizing. The Singapore government thus far has done a good job of handling the crisis, and had done detailed contact tracing. I would still say the situation here is still in control at moment of writing."
What about Qatar and Kuwait advising against travel. Likely others will follow suit?
What about qatar and Kuwait advising against travel? Likely others will follow suit? 2 new cases today. Is that good as fewer than yesterday and saturday or bad as still new cases? Confusing.!Due to travel Thursday to visit family. Dont want cancel unless necessary.nothing new from FCO ...yet.Is anyone still intending to.go.in next few days?
"Hi Vivienhttps://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-ea…This article states:“ SINGAPORE - The Embassy of the State of Qatar on Sunday (Feb 9) advised all Qatari citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to Singapore because of the spread of the coronavirus. This came a day after Kuwait issued a similar warning.Citizens of both countries were advised to take necessary precautions, and to follow instructions issued by Singapore authorities through the Ministry of Health website.”No one can argue with a government warning. And you’re right other countries may well follow shortly as the trend has not declined to date/ However, upon inspection of the wording - This implies YES you can come, if you MUST, it’s not critical (eg DORSCON is Orange - not red) but abide by a higher hygiene regime. I note per the table given in the link below, neither of Kuwait or Qatar have reported a single case. They may well have issued the warning as a precaution to maintain their zero footprint. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Either way. Stay safe."
"Thank you for your prompt response. Ive been reading all.your posts.you are living in Singapore? My daughter and family.live there and this is my last chance to.visit so.im really hoping not have to cancel. One individuals probability of contracting the virus is less than winning the lottery but of course understand the public health implications of spread. Not seen any comments about the meaning of the 2 new cases reported today as I said. Is it good as going down to about 5% increase or bad as still new cases?Edited: 12:36 pm, February 10, 2020 "
I note on another thread you advised family and friends NOT to visit?
"Hi Vivien,It is not critical here yet. 5 new cases reported, an average growth rate of around 10% a day, 45 in total. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/My friends and family have kids. For sure my advice is to delay per my post. I am living and working in Singapore. For me the barometer is DORSCON. Currently Orange, set by Government, cannot be argued against. When this turns Green, all systems go. If it goes Red, lockdown. We passed yellow days ago. I asked friends and family to monitor and wait for DORSCON reduction.https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanAs for Qatar and Kuwait, both don’t say categorically don’t go. They say if it’s essential go, but observe heightened hygiene. It’s a plus and minus, but I could distill my advice thus 1. if you must come, come now while it is not critical. The number of cases, following trend, will only increase and with it the risk will rise later. 2. If you have a choice, and don’t want the hassle or stress of increased vigilance, then delay or choose a non infected destination if it’s a holiday. Either way, it’s your choice, weigh up the plus and minus and whatever you decide, safe travels !BillEdited: 1:12 pm, February 10, 2020 "
"Vivien , none of us are qualified to offer any advice, per-se.Only opinions. Being in Singapore itself is the least of the “dangers”, probably. It’s the travelling to and from in confined spaces from people’s travels wide and far. The interaction in planes and airports with thousands of other travellers, is probably where the greater dangers lie.Singapore is relatively safe, but that can change to completely safe or it may get less so. Who knows? Viruses don’t need or have passports, nor are they any respecter of persons. Just my opinion. Good luck with any decision you make.Edited: 1:23 pm, February 10, 2020 "

We are cancelling our March trip. I can use vigilant hand-washing but am wary of restaurant and other workers.
"With those infected as at today being 45 in 5.7m, I think you're all safer being here then staying in the US.US road fatality rates according to 2018 statistics are at 11 per 100,000 and gun related deaths at 12 per 100,000Not difficult to do the maths..."
"Residents must appreciate that tourists can have a different outlook than residents. Its much easier perceive and handle an adverse situation while at home than when you are a tourist in a foreign country. Most importantly, a tourist goes on a holiday to enjoy and have peaceful time. If a tourist is going to be worried all the time about falling sick the purpose of going on a holiday gets defeated.Its good for residents to share how Singapore remains reasonably safe in spite of the outbreak raging in China. However, there is no point in going overboard with irrelevant statistical data."
">>they have the right to be concerned.<<Everybody has a right to be concerned, but people do need to put those concerns actually into perspective...That's all the message I'm trying to get across."
">>there is no point in going overboard with irrelevant statistical data.<<It's not irrelevant statistical data at all. It is data to support the irrational fears.If somebody is willing to step outside of their house with statistics such as those I showed but not willing to travel to a city where those statistics are much lower and also the ratio of 2019nCov cases too. I'm trying to get to understand the rational behind that decision.Is it the fear of the unknown?Edited: 9:21 pm, February 10, 2020 "
"Dear Sig79,I’m really chuffed by what you said. I did not expect it and I appreciate your kind words. I’m very very sorry you changed your plans, but your decision, as is anyone’s after weighing the plus and minus, Considering their personal circumstances is the right one. I have friends and family in US, San Francisco, New York and Florida. It’s an incredibly long journey to make and quite an investment too, but also an amazing dream to come true to be here in Singapore at a time in the near future when things are better. So I sincerely hope you will come in the future. Yes, I felt harassed at times, @Rastnim had the dignity to apologise in another thread, and I accepted. I don’t much care for those who want to tag team against an opinion they don’t agree with, attack personally, for any agenda. The Singapore Government speaks for itself, regardless of those who think they they know better, through its DORSCON rating. A real objective acid test for all industries and individuals in Singapore. When they decided to increase the level to Orange from Yellow, they didn’t do so lightly. The Government knew full well this might increase hysteria but it decided to do so anyway because they are totally committed to quarantining it, by putting in some world class controls. When DORSCON goes Green, all of this hysteria and stress, will just go away. I pray that it will. My advice on delay is that I want my friends and family to visit here, with their kids, when stress is lower, when DORSCON is lower.‘Disease Outbreak Response System Condition’ (DORSCON) is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation. The framework provides us with general guidelines on what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections.DORSCON takes into account:“The current disease situation overseasHow transmissible the disease isHow likely it is to arrive in SingaporeWhat impact it may have on Singapore’s community”https://www.gov.sg/article/what-do-the-diffe…If you imagine threat level split into 4:green (0-25%) yellow (26- 50%)Orange (51-75%)Red ( 76 - 100%)It’s currently Orange (51-75%) “What are the additional measures to be introduced?Under DORSCON Orange, additional precautionary measures will be introduced to minimise the risk of further transmission of the virus, and raise the protection of vulnerable groups.Cancel or defer large-scale events, or put in place necessary precautions if proceeding“https://www.gov.sg/article/additional-measur…The businesses have listened https://www.finews.asia/finance/30953-corona…I stress that the response from the Government that I’ve personally been affected by, is world class. It does not mean I can pretend to ignore DORSCON, even in safe hands. I increase my vigilance as does everyone. You are still able to function, to explore, to experience in daily life with extra precautions.Thank you BillEdited: 10:22 pm, February 10, 2020 "

">>Please help me understand why that's so difficult to understand for Singaporeans on these threads?<<Because this is the first time you've explained your concerns over the quarantine and being isolated far from home, which is totally understandable. I for one would not like to be in the position of those unfortunately caught up in the cruise ship in Japan.A clearer explanation goes a long way in dispelling any perceived negativity that may come your way.Now that you've explained your concerns I am totally understand your decision and apologies for coming across as defensive.The problem is that many similar threads on here (not just Singapore forum) have been started with the same rather generic fears and little rational discussions, hence it has got some peoples backs up, including mine. However thank you for engaging in a grown up discussion about the situation. This hopefully show's where there is common understanding from both sides.I'm glad to hear that you've got full refunds with no issues."
"As Singapore's PM mentioned in his speech a few days ago, the situation is still evolving. It means that even the health authorities cannot predict what the corona virus situation is going to be in the future. The government will change their approach depending on how the situation evolves, whether the outbreak intensifies or eases out. When the health authorities do not know what the future situation is going to be, how can anyone on this forum be qualified to advise whether it is safe to undertake travel to Singapore in say 15 days or a month from now? At best, we can tell what the situation is today and what measures are in place. But for those who plan to undertake a trip in future, say a month from now, its pretty much futile to ask questions like ""will I be ok?"" on this form. Because no one knows whether it is going to remain orange alert or get worse to red alert or will ease to yellow or green alert in the near future.Edited: 11:52 pm, February 10, 2020 "

"Sig79,Out of curiosity was your flight ticket purchased directly with Singapore Airlines or did you go through an independent agent?I/we are in a similar situation to yourself.Many thanks."
"Hi Sig79,Did you book through a Travel Agent or direct with airline. We have a trip planned for April on non-refundable tickets, transiting through Singapore to Seoul. Our daughter has a 5 day holiday planned in Singapore on the way back. Our travel agent said they could only give a refund if the airline grant wavers for certain destinations. Perhaps I need to contact the airline first, get their agreement and then take it up with the TA, who charge an additional $300 on top of the airline charges for cancellations or changes (if they are part of the ticket price). Your experience gives me hope that we could get a refund on non-refundable tickets. I think we could get some of our expenses back for accommodation in Seoul also."
"Hi Priyansha,I am travelling with my family today to Singapore for vacation. My family is also concerned with the situation there. I had to persuade them to not cancel the travel. If you see this then let me know the exact situation there. We have been tracking news since last week on all updates. Also, we hear that masks and groceries are getting exhausted from retail stores and malls."
"Hi Pratik,You can update yourself here https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanHope you have an exciting time, safely Bill"
"@PratikBetter bring masks from India. Even if masks are available here, please leave them for the locals.Groceries are in abundant supply. There was a bit of panic buying after the government changed the alert level from Yellow to Orange. But shops/supermarkets are stocked with essentials again.Avoid crowded places unless you have a purpose. Avoid casual visits to malls if you do not really intend to shop.Follow good personal hygiene. Avoid touching surfaces if not necessary (even your own face and mouth). Keep napkins or tissues handy at all times. Use an alcohol based sanitizer or wet wipes while moving around.If possible, minimize travel by MRT/buses and use taxis as it will reduce your exposure to crowds. While traveling in taxis, tell the driver that you wish to roll down the windows for better ventilation.Follow instructions at tourist attractions meticulously even if you do not understand for what purpose they are."
"Hi Pratik,To add to the very sensible advice shared by MRahul below, I would confirm that masks and hand santisers remain sold out in CBD area, bring your own. I would also suggest review of videos below, especially the one from Gov.SgVIDEO DORSCON ORANGE IMPACT IN SINGAPOREhttps://youtu.be/dNeJmgZXK3YVIDEO Gov.Sg HOW DAILY LIFE AFFECTEDhttps://youtu.be/kR6XnYOk0HcWhatever you decide, good luck and safe travels!Bill"

"Thanks Bill for a link to a very useful article, it's making me think again about today's plans.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51736185 is also about the risk of public transport.I'm not sure about taxis. It just depends on luck, as does everything with this virus.Taxis in Singapore are well regulated. Users don't need to worry about dodgy drivers, although the advice is good for some other countries. I think Bill was just including it to lighten his post. He lives here, and knows how safe the taxis are."
