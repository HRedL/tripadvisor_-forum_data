"Hi all, me and my family are due to come and stay at hotel palia la rocka in may, what are peoples thoughts on travel? Do you think we will still be able to go? Kids are so excited but each time im turning the tele on and seeing the news it isnt looking very promising"
"All we can do is wait Jess (we're in a similar boat, though in a villa, not hotel).I think if the right things are done now by May it will hopefully be forgotten about - almost!What's the payment situation? Do you still have to pay the balance? If so it's worth some discussion for sure. If already paid then hey, wait and see."
"If say there is probably next to no chance. Expect flights to Spain, maybe all flights in general) to be cancelled in the next 2 weeks or so."
"We have Ryanair flights booked for 8th April but are not expecting them to go ahead.Over 100 cases in Andalusia now according to Olive Press.Edited: 6:10 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Luckily we havnt paid for accomodation yet, just the flights upfront, hopefully these would get refunded. People have such different outlooks on it tho and makes you wonder if and when to start worrying, what will happen with your holiday with it being villa if flights are cancelled, are you insured? Such a stress isnt it i bet...fingers crossed its all sorted soon."
"Nobody has any idea what the situation will be in May, so all you can do is sit and wait. Put it like this, there aren’t likely to be lots of other people rushing to book accommodation at the moment so don’t worry.If the flights are cancelled you will be refunded, if you cancel now then you won’t be."
"what will happen with your holiday with it being villa if flights are cancelled, are you insured?Your insurance should cover your accommodation whether its a hotel/apartment or private booking for an apartment or villa. As long as there is a paper trail and proof of payment."
"Just a waiting game at the moment I'm afraid, no one knows what will be happening in May."
"Mantalk, it seems that a lot of the insurance policies deem pandemics to be unforeseeable events (what used to be called Acts of God) and won’t pay out. Personally I wouldn’t book anything at the moment (tempting as those flight prices are) but obviously each to their own on this."
Maybe canceled flights come under the unforeseen circumstances clause.
We have an annual multi-trip policy through Holiday Extras that specifically excludes claims due to 'declared pandemics'. It also has a 30-day trip limit so I wonder what would happen if we were quarantined in Spain beyond the 30-day limit. No cover I guess. It's almost 4 weeks until we're due to fly and I think the go/no go decision will be made for us by the powers that be!
Had an email from Insure and Go yesterday - have an annual policy. It stated that any issues arising from Coronavirus - if holiday etc booked before 12th March was covered but anything done after that would not be. It did give some peace of mind - I would imagine if you are stuck for 30 days beyond your control they could not make that binding. The 30 day rule applies to most policies but folk tend not to look at the small print - it's possible to extend for a further premium
There is absolutely no chance anyone will be going in may will probably be September/October before holidays resume
Why speculate? Just do as we are told and hope for the best. Dont make it last longer than it needs to.
A health spokesman on the news has said they expect the 2nd wave to be around September/October - don'topt to rebook another flight instead of refund - there is no guarantee that there will be any flights etc.
"Wish we could get a refund, meant to be flying out from Edinburgh this Sat 21st, but Ryanair still showing as Scheduled. Can change and book another flight, but no idea when things will get back to normal."
"Due to this new FCO advice they will have to give you a refund, so don’t change it. At the moment they will be busier with repatriation flights, it’s not surprising really that they can’t get around to the hundreds of thousands looking for refunds.https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice"
It is a shame Easyjet haven't updated their website regarding Covid19 since 13th March (4 days ago) as there have been significant changes since then and no doubt more to come as the week draws to a close:https:/…latest-travel-information
Not sure hs but i think easyjet update the 'Read more' link at the bottom of the covid-19 piece.
