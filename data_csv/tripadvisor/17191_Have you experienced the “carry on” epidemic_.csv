"Thanks to virtually all the airlines who are now charging fees for “checked” baggage, we now have an epidemic of travelers who insist on stuffing their entire wardrobe into a “carry on” bag and a “personal item”. These are the people who get totally irate when their overstuffed bag will not fit into the overhead bin and everyone’s valuable time is wasted while a desperate attempt to re-arrange bags takes place before the flight attendant tells them they “MUST CHECK THEIR BAG”. I am sure, in their minds, those four words must seem to come at them in a garbled, slow motion sort of way, but when it sinks in, it’s as if the world just came to an end. If you are one of the unfortunate souls to get stuck boarding the plane last, you, too, will have the pleasure of being told you must check your bags, because there is no more room.So, have you had the pleasure of experiencing, what I fondly call, PPS (Penny Pincher Syndrome)?Happy Holidays and Happy Traveling!!!"
"Oh ya, we've experienced it. We only carry our valuables in our checked luggage. I just don't see getting on the plane last and not having room for our valuables while the select group of people that boarded before us was allowed to take on everything they own. I wish they would check the size upon boarding the plane and perhaps those with the large items would have to check and not someone like us with valuables that we are protecting from luggage handlers and TSA."
I experienced pps one time only and that was flying domestic within the us. Horrible. Thank god it hasnt gotten to that point here in canada
"Don't hate the player, hate the game.If airlines didn't insist in nickel and diming us all to death, I believe that far fewer people would be trying to pack everything, including the kitchen sink, into their carry-ons."
I travel with carry-on only. I save the airline time of not having to handle my luggage.
"We always book the first row seats on the ""way down"" there for get on last, we bring a carry on each, though I dodn't think we will this time, and there is never room for them> Not sure why this is , ours are legal size, legal weight etc. Ours are hard shells in case we buy at the duty free on the way down. Ours are stuffed to the max when we go to Cuba, which is another story I wont get into here, but still in the legal weight limit. So we contribute to holding things up I guess, because of the booked front row, and no space left for our things."
"I travel with carry-on only, always have. I don't see it as any worse than in the past.If the airlines can't make a profit, then they will go out of business. If they go out of business then I can't get to the Cancun airport. If I can't get to the Cancun airport, then I can't get to Playa del Carmen. They have to cut their cost or increase revenue. I'm all for baggage fees. I'm all for a jet fuel surcharge.Edited: 8 years ago "
"You obviously haven't experienced the ""The Airline Lost My Luggage AGAIN"" epidemic or you'd be all about traveling with only your carry-on."
"Ah yes, the green-horn, once-a-year fliers.....don't you just love em?I would predict the airlines will realize it is in everyone’s best interest if they simply reversed the process. Carry ons should incur a fee whereas the first checked bag is free. Additional baggage, of course subject to fee. It is a benefit to the customer to be able to carry on a bag since they can bypass the luggage carousel and make a quick exit. As such, and is customary in business, people should pay for these benefits. Excessive carry ons slow the boarding and de-planing process, increases risk of injury, increases delayed departures and thus lost revenue for the airline to mention more irritable customers. As far as the airlines ""nickle and diming"", if you have ideas on how airlines can increase their profitability in today’s economic climate, I'd really love to hear them. I'm not condoning more fees - just do realize operating an airline in today’s market is extremely brutal. Smell the coffee."
Agree I think that if the carry on does not fit in their silly little carrey on sizer thing then it MUST be checked. We watch people jam their crap into the overhead bins squashing everyone elses stuff at the same time. Totally unnecessary and rude. Check a bag and deal with it its part of travel. We stay for 18 days so there is no way that fits in a carry on.
I agree with Bellasogno - charge for the carry ons!
Charge by weight of passenger plus luggage. :)
now there is an excellent idea!
"Fly Jetblue, bring a bag and a carryon and except the price you paid without the bs."
"""Charge by weight of passenger plus luggage. :)""Excellent idea! There's an incentive to stay thin."
Not only stay thin buy stay home..........
"typo- but, sorry."
"The only time that we've checked a bag recently is when we went to Belize for three months.I just arrived in Curacao today, we're here (and in Bonaire) for a total of 15 nights. I have a small carry on that fits in any overhead, other than the very small commuter jets, where it is gate checked. I also have a backpack that ifts under the seat.I'm not very strong, but, I have no trouble getting my bag into the overheads.Yes, there has been a huge increase in carry on bags. On our trip to Key West a couple of weeks ago, we were pretty much the last ones who boarded who didn't have to check our bags.I noticed this morning, when we were printing our boarding passes in MIA, that for US$9.00 I could move my boarding group up to Group 1, which boards after all the 'elite' fliers. I chose not to pay the money, for a vacation destination like Curacao, overhead space wasn't as much of a problem. They were making people check overly large carry ons though.I'm not cheap, coming down here it's one bag free, I just prefer to have my 'stuff' with me."
"I travel frequently enough to know all I need is a carry-on and I know what fits in it. Because of this, my luggage goes wherever I do. I was warned once to never check my bags and I did not listen. That's when my bags flew to a different city and I was stuck with nothing for a few days. Never again. I know how much fits and I do not overpack."
"I'm flying to CUN with Spirit in a couple of weeks and if it does not fit under the seat in front of you, your charged $....stops all this nonsense...jmoI think it has to be 17inches in height and 14 width..Safe travels...jimmyEdited: 8 years ago "
"go thru the b/s associated with lost or missing luggage & you will never check bags again, I rent condo with washer/dryer , me & wifey do carry on for 3 weeks..land at CUN, pass cust/immigration , in rental car & on beach in playa usually withing 1 1/2 to 2 hours...works for me... it's not a money thing but a time thing for me !!!"
"Miker, how many times has your luggage been lost or misdirected, and in how many million air miles? Just curious.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Always check a bag, can't be bothered to even attempt doing just carry-on, not worth it to me I have never have had one go missing yet in over 30 airline flights now.....knock on wood, of course. I do always pack a small carry on that fits under the seat easily with anything of value and enough clothes to get me through a day or two. Thankfully, as another poster mentioned this trend of charging for all checked bags has not yet spread to Canadian airlines. again, knock on wood."
"Several million flight miles, more retired frequent flyer cards retired due to airlines out of business than I can recall, over 20 years of frequent flying, 2-3 flights/week. Lost baggage - zero. Redirected/non arrival baggage, twice.Lucky? Doubtful. Consider the stats of passengers vs. lost checked baggage.I only mention this to counter the idiocy of those that would imply checked baggage means lost or misplaced luggage. Again, how many million air miles there lucky?"
"I really like this thread. I'm a frequent traveler. Have had 'misdirected' luggage' many a time. Flew this past weekend(Thanksgiving) with checked luggage and carry on my laptop. Checked in online, get to the gate. They tell me they have to change my seat due to what I'm still not sure. I'm seated near front so I'm one of last to board, did my duty checked in early. Stuck with middle seat right behind 1st class. That of course has no space under ths seat in front to put my laptop because of the wall for 1st class. So I became a victim of no overhead space. Theres no way I want my laptop under the plane like they wanted. After few minutes of fussing they put it in 1st class overhead compartment. Geez. I used to love to fly..."
"Actually it is a curse that only some people have been given.(lost or misdirected luggage).I have one sister whose bags have been lost or arrived late every single time she has flown on a trip from age 20 to 50+, except for short business flights where she doesn't check a bag!OTOH, I have flown probably twice as many times as she has in the same time period, and have never had any luggage lost or misdirected. Worst that ever happened to me was one time when reclaiming luggage after customs, arriving back home to PIT, some idiot picked up my bag and proceeded away with it, while I was futher down the conveyor belt searching for my bag to arrive! The customs agent stopped him and made him go back and get his correct bag, but did not put mine back on the belt, but instead put it in a small room behind his podium, so it caused me a few anxious moments, but once I went to the agent and told him all the bags had come off and mine was not there, he asked me to describe it, and then went into that little room and brought out my bag. When vacationing, unlike business trips within the US, we like to take whatever we feel we might need or want to be comfortable for a week, and we do check one bag each. Of course we also plan our beach weeks so that we fly on the days that non stop direct charter air is available, and there is no charge for the first checked bag on Apple charters.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Has anyone checked if the legal size of the carry one was changed recently by your airline? I flew to Europe recently and decided to check the carry-on allowance before packed and noticed air carriers decreased the thickness of the carry on, it is now 20-23 cm which is really thin and hard to find a luggage piece to comply, I would say that most of the specially designated luggage carry-ones would be more than that.Also how is the current situation with the size control, has anyone been turned down with their carry-on recently and sent to check it in, and what air-carrier was it? I am just wondering if they are really going to reinforce the new size limits?"
"In my airline days , I only used carry on and never had a problem. A couple of reasons for that. First, I was usually in first class, so no problem and since flying on space available always a chance I wouldnt make the flight but my checked luggage would. (the airlines are supposed to have a way to handle that problem but doesnt always work)In the hundreds of times I have flown with checked bags, only one problem. And statistics show that usually to be the case.In the city where I worked, we had a supervisor who observed the boarding and really watched the size of the carry ons and made many gate check their bags. More should do that.I know our flight attendants really dreaded return flights from vacation destinations because so many bought ridiculous items that obviously would not fit in the overhead- but they still tried."
"Yesterday, on our flight from Miami to Curacao, I witnessed several people being told that there bags were too large for carry on and they would have to be checked. So, it does happen.I suspect my carry on may be too 'thick' for the latest standards. Since it fits in virtually all the overheads I've flown on (other than small commuter planes), I guess I don't see the problem.Flying carry on only also limits the amounts of 'silly' souvenirs that I drag home....."
This website will tell everyone the size of their carry-on and bagage on all airlines..Just click on you airline mine was just Spirit..Safe travels...jimmyseatguru.com/airlines/…baggage.php
"Count me among the lucky, never had any baggage lost or mis-directed but I think it's helpful to fly direct when possible, less change of your luggage not making it.I hate lugging a carryon around the airport and frankly, I have never waited more than a few minutes to collect my bag in Cancun.I'm also only 5ft tall so loading and unloading into the overhead is difficult for me and I don't feel it is any one elses job to get it down for me.My best advice is don't book a short connection, be sure you have a swimsuit and a days clothes in your backpack and relax."
"I was getting married overseas and luckily I placed my wedding dress in carry on as did my husband with his suit. Our suitcases arrived at the doorstep 2 days before our flight back to US, this is only one example of many more. Now, I travel with carry on only, especially to worm destinations.We're going to Belize in couple weeks for 16 days, three people 2 back packs and camera equipment. I agree, charge per traveler weight!"
"I like the idea of charging by gross weight of passenger + their respective baggage. So, combine that with the idea of reversal of charges for carry-ons, and allowing 1st checked bag free, and the ailines have a winning formula. This would be pretty easy to implement - holding your carry on, step on the scale. With a predetermined formula, that's your baggage fee. Checked luggage, first bag is free.Edited: 8 years ago "
"......except here in the US, the scales would need to be industrial size to accommodate, eh hem, most passengers."
"I'm old school and still follow the golden rule. All I have in my carry on are meds, cameras, a change of clothes and a bathing suit (in case they lose our luggage) . Hubby's carry on has those neck things and books for the flight plus his change of clothes and suit. Once on board we empty his out (except the change of clothes) and squish it as much as possible. Everything else is in our checked bags. We get the AI packages so there's no point in rushing out when we land. We have to wait for everyone else to get on the bus anyway. My vacation starts when the plane takes off. I try to leave all my stress on the runway."
"Just to clarify my previous ""nickle and diming"" statement - I understand as much as most about the economic realities of the airline industry these days but extra fees or charges for ANYTHING drive me nuts. Just tell me how much it costs for a seat, one checked bag and one REASONABLE sized carry on and I'm happy to pay it. It's getting to the airport and having to paying extra for something as basic as ONE checked bag that irks me.I LOVE the idea of a poundage fee ..... but you just know we're then going to see all sort of complaints about nearly-nekkid people who are trying to save weight by wearing fewer clothes on the plane. (And, of course, it's NEVER gonna be the people you wouldn't mind seeing nekkid that would dress that way!!!!!)On the bright side, less clothing/more revealing clothing might make things easier/quicker at Security!!!"
"Actually, no - I have not experienced it enough that it would be worth commenting about on a forum - or on my travel specific web site/blog. When I fly my regular route to Chicago, with all business travelers, everyone has a rollaboard that fits in the overhead, and a personal item that fits below the seat in front of them. In fact, I find it's the families who I see arriving at the airport when I do, but always manage to board late - rushing on the plane in a flurry of confusion. They then proceed to attempt to delay the flight by asking people to move around so they can sit with their teenage children for 2 hours. suitcaseready.com"
"Totally agree, evening. It is rarely a frequent traveler creating the problem but those who rarely fly. For that reason, when I was with the airline, our flight attendants preferred to work either business routes or the first class cabin. Both usually cause few problems."
"Wouldn't you think that it wouldn't even require a frequent flyer to comprehend the fact that there is a persons head on the other side of that head rest? Don't you just love it when the person in back of you is using your headrest to lift their fat self out of their seat, launching your head into your tray table?"
"This calls for a new thread entitled ""I coulda used a carry on instead""? I'm referring to so many of us that overpack and find out we don't really need all that stuff.....A few years ago the light bulb finally went on and realized we only need carry ons.SD"
"I need a ""like"" button for bellasogno"
"Actually - no - I fly several times a month and no overweight person has ever used my headrest to help themselves in or out of their seat. I have been on 1 Jet Blue flight in the exit row between 2 overweight people, 1 of whom managed to raise and lower my arm rest every time she breathed, but again - this was 1 flight out of many - and it was several years ago.My issue is either the person who needs to constantly raise and lower their seat, bashing my knees every time (it it's usually short people who DONT need the legroom - they just like to play with the seat apparently)and people not skilled in using the AVOD who pound the back of my seat the entire flight on Continental, where the mechanism is on the seat back. I much prefer the arm rest controller, even if it means the person next to me occassionally changes my channels with their elbow.suitcaseready.com"
"I travel with carry on only as much as possible. I do think that a lot of the problems encountered with the carry on situation are those that fly very infrequently (once a year or less - basically amateur flyers) and are not familiar with the 'rules of flight'. I used to fly quite extensively for work and know how to pack. Our 14th trip to PDC is coming up in May and we are doing only carry on this time. I have always gotten all of my clothes and such for 9 nights in a airplane sized appropriate/approved carry on (again, I know how to pack, I do not over pack and I do use everything I take - some multiple times, I even have a spreadsheet that I update after every trip to minimize thigs to pack as much as possible, yes hubby gives me a hard time about that one!). The thing that tripped me up were the liquids. I have bad allergies and typically have to bring everything I need (we stay at a resort not close to town so going to Mega/Walmart is really an not an option) . This next trip I am going to just bite the bullet and use the products offered at the resort and see how it goes, all else fails is I ask a friend of mine to stop by Walmart and pick up a few things for me. I have also found a few things as a solid that I can use. I am thrilled that we won't have to wait the ages it takes for our luggage to come out on the carousel (okay, in reality some trips are fairly quick but other are nightmares when arriving in CUN). We are usually one of the first off the plane because when we don't upgrade, I get one of the first coach rows of seats (preferably bulkhead). I don't care about any baggage fees (have actually never paid them due to my 'status' on the airline). We have upgraded tickets for this trip but are in the first couple of groups that board the plane for all trips. I also like the pay by pounds idea! :-)"
"If you really want to see a fun 'discussion', start a thread about whether or not people should recline when seated in coach.....lol!"
"akandalother than sunscreen for the body, I can go 2-3 wks in a ziploc - and I bring all my own liquids! The key is to invest in a set of Nalgene travel bottles (the 2oz ones if you need a lot of different products)I can even fit a 2oz bottle of sunscreen for the face in there - just not a larger one to slather all over the body - so I buy Clinique at duty free (I need paba and fragrance free - which I never want to risk finding in Mexico-Central America).not supposed to link to posts on my site, but there is one there about traveling 2 wks in a Ziploc bag. Ive actually done 3+ wks in SE Asia and only had to buy more body lotion.suitcaseready.com"
"Thanks evening...I actually have a great set of Nalgene bottles. One major problem is that up until a few weeks ago, I had pretty long hair (cut off over 5 inches) and would need at least 10 oz of conditioner to make it 9 nights. That is the biggie that I am not worrying about this trip (and the shampoo) and just using what they offer at the EDM. Shopping at the duty free is a great idea for the way down....but we always opted for bloody marys at the club room ;-). We won't have time this trip around with 58 minute connection time in ATL (we are the first flight of the day at 5:30 am so it shouldn't be a problem but it will be quick). I was wondering if the duty free shop in baggage claim CUN (I know there is a Clinique counter at the departures duty free) had sundries such as lotion, shampoo, etc...anyone know?"
"We've never taken much as carry on in the past - laptop and a backpack with camera equipment, books, etc. This year we are going for longer and want to each take a full size carryon with us as well as checked luggage - will put laptop inside carryon. Now I'm concerned if there will be room as we have seats close to the front of the plane - row 4 - booked early to ensure we were close to the front as I'm a touch claustrophobic and need to be in the aisle and close to front. We are flying Westjet out of Calgary direct to Cancun - anyone have any problem on Westjet flights with room for carryon considering that we will pretty much be the last to board.Thanks for your help."
