I'd like to know if you think clubs and bars will be fully open by late July or August in magaluf
I'd like to know the winning numbers in tonights lottery draw.
I would like to know when my wife will stop nagging me to paint the bathroom.
"That last one is simple; once you paint the bathroom. Although, obviously a month later she won’t like the colour and will want it changed. I’ve lost count the amount of times ... :("
"I would like to know what to do today. All the apartment has been decorated. Bunk beds in spare room been stripped down , sanded numerous times, wall plaster repaired and painted. Projects started at lockdown , ran out of material then waited two months to buy more and finish all. Used the car first time for ages and was like an oven so air con topped up yesterday. Think I’ll head to the beach today for first time this year and not worry about booking a flight to Glasgow for a while. Before I book I will enquire on TA what places will be open and how they observe social distance , have to put a hole in my mask to use a straw when out drinking. Is it ok to eat haggis again."
"some would question if it was ever okay to eat haggis :p ;)nb. not me, i love offal, the spicier the better."
"Chunky,My wife once accused me of putting wall paper on upside down, it was lining paper ready for painting sigh"
I adore Haggis. they're a devil to catch though.
Due to the current epidemic they are now reared on Haggis farms to save costs of hunting.
The first Haggis Farm is beside Loch Ness.
My father always used to tell me that haggis had legs shorter on one side so it was easier to run round the top of the sloped mountains in the wild.
That's exactly what my Dad told me.Are you my brother from another Mother?
But everybody knows that’s true Chunky.
I want to know what the weather will be like in late July / August :-)
Trinet can answer that.
"And what's the exchange rate, missed that one as well."
"Never mind the weather Mark, how much time do you have left on your passport?"
"How much is a large beer in Magaluf?Edited: 11:42 am, May 31, 2020 "
Anyone know of any good blanket trips?
"Oh yes I miss the blanket trip saga especially when she found they were made a mile away from her UK homeEdited: 12:04 pm, May 31, 2020 "
Darn it how could I have missed my favourites. I look forward to helping people find an authentic village with no other tourists and a hotel on the beach in August.
Ha ha haNow now play nice.Hope your all well.Grant
"B & P:""Never mind the weather Mark, how much time do you have left on your passport?""Ha ha haWell actually, I was wondering, although my passport has several years left, will I have to get a new one if I go in August, as the UK will be leaving the EU at the end of the year, and that's less than 6 months away (from August) and my passport has EU written on it, and you're meant to have more than 6 months left on your passport if you travel to the EU?:-) :-) :-)"
"Haha! I got mine renewed in between travel periods on a ""you never know"" basis."
I'm hoping to go on holiday to Mallorca later this year.Do I need a passport or can I use my Bingo membership pass?
"Nah, he doesn’t have a bus pass, Chris is just a bairn. He’s a local (well, honorary) so probably doesn’t need a passport either."
"Still got my residencia, tram pass and NIE B.All kept on a low light on the back burner for my eventual totally permanent return!!!Although I have to admit this tempts me hugely.1. Location.2. Proximity to Seville.3. Proximity to Cadiz.4. Proximity to countles other Andalucian gems and a quick uber cheap flight to PMI as and when.https:/…"
At the moment it's hard to want to be anywhere else when the weather is this good. Actually as I write this I can see a guy in fluorescent orange budgie smugglers heading for the sea. He may not have to worry about social distance.
"Thanks LL, that’s just put me off my tea!Ah Chris, Seville and Cadiz, two of my favourite places on the planet. Think LL has a soft spot for them too."
You know it. In fact I think it was you BandP that sang Cadiz' praises on this forum and it made us want to visit. We fell in love with Seville years ago. I dont recommend it in high summer (they don't call it The Cauldron for nothing) but we love it in late February and March. It's an elegant yet unpretentious city and always something new to discover. I've booked flights for next March. It's the only trip I feel confident about in the next year.
