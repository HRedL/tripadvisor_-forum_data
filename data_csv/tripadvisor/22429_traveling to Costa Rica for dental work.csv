"I am planning a trip to Costa Rica later this year. My husband needs extensive work done... I understand there are some excellent dentists. It seems as though Dr. Alberto Meza has the most "" American"" credentials ... I have read a lot about Dr. Obando also, but i have seen a few negative reviews as well (and he seems really young?) . I can't find anything bad about Meza. He seems to be top notch. I imagine Meza and Nova are at the top end as far as prices go. How about some of the less ""flashy"" practices? Any recommendations of someone who is really good , will provide top quality work and product without the upcharge?Any advice to offer? Thank you!!!! Pura Vida :-)"
"Both of my daughters, my brother and husband have had dental work in Costa Rica. I was the head researcher, decision maker and appointment scheduler so I feel "" qualified"" to respond. My husband and brother had implants, root canals and crowns done by Dr Obando and his team at Nova. They were all very pleased and 1-3 years later, they've had no problems whatsoever. I know or have talked to a numver of people who have been to Dr Obando and all have been very satisfied. I did read a complaint somewhere from someone who gave absolutely no info on what happened or what his beef was saying something like ""he lied to me to my face and his wife ( the endodontist) is unstable"". Maybe so, but my experience is he is highly skilled, highly ethical and he and his staff are highly profesdional. He does look young, but I think they graduate from dental school younger than in the States and when I started researching dentists 5 years ago, he was practicing then and I don't know for how long before that. He did post graduate work of a year or two at NYU so I don't think the amount of his US study is less than what Meza has done. Both of my daughters have had extensive dental work, one had 16 crowns with Dr Eduardo Castro and another daughter had a complete dental makeover with implants with Dr Arnoldo Anglada and the crowns with Dr Castro. They, too are outstanding. The daughter that has all implants recently went to a local dentist to have them cleaned and the dentist confirmed that Dr Anglada and Castro did a great job. (""The implants are straight and nicely spaced"". She said the bridges were""beautiful"".) Dr Meza has a sterling reputation, and it's my understanding he is the priciest in Costa Rica. I am not sure how /why he can command the highest prices and have always wondered what one would get over and above what one gets with. Dr Anglada, Castro and Obando, but his website says he has a ""boutique"" practice. If your husband needs a boutique practice, then he's your man. Otherwise there are a lot of good dentists in CR. Dr Prado has a really good reputation, and the recovery retreat where I've stayed a couple of times refer their patients to Dr Vargas. I met several people who absolutely loved him, but they needed single implants, crowns and general dentistry. Also, Dr Flikier has a very good reputation (and a boutique-ier practice) and has post graduate training at Boston University.Good luck in your search. There are some great dentists in CR, PM me if you have any wuestions."
"I have posted here before based on the experiences I had with dental work in Costa RIca. I chose Dr Anglada for implants and Dr Castro for crowns (they work in the same office) after having 2 failed implants in Florida. This is a state of the art, professionally run operation. , Dr Anglada is some kind of genius for implants, he did 5 with bone grafts in less than 40 minutes. There was no pain though some discomfort when the Novocaine wore off (I took the painkiller he prescribed). I was fine the next day and had no issues with them. Later in the year I returned for 8 crowns, this is a more time consuming process. They look exactly like the teeth I lost, fit perfectly and work perfectly. Dr Castro also replaced all my silver and discolored fillings. Please feel free to contact me if you want more information. I have only heard good things about Nova/Dr Obando as well. Either clinic is a good choice."
"I have had a sinus lift, extractions, implants and crowns done by Dr Obando at Nova. He would be flattered that you think he looks so Young! He is an excellent Professional and recently won a Prestigious Professional award. He had extensive implant training/education in the US and regularly attends Seminars etc in the US. The only negative review I personally read was posted by someone who obviously had an ""agenda"" as Neither Dentist has ""a wife"" working there. My Husband was at NOVA last month and was very pleased with crowns and having multiple old fillings removed/replaced. My initial work was 3 years ago and I have been back a few times, could not be happier. I have referrred friends, one of whom had a total mouth restoration over a year ago and is still very happy with the work, not to mention the huge $ savings. I have had some general dental work there with Dr Chavarria who is also excellent. The entire Staff go out of their way to make your experience comfortable. I don't find the clinic ""flashy"" . It is very clean and sanitary and they have the latest in dental equipment which is not the case with our Dentist here in Florida. Do Your research and ck reviews on several sites. Email NOVA with ?s and Dr O will email you back. There are several good choices. According to reviews several not good ones as well!"
Well hard topic…as a costarican…my whole family we go to DENTAVAC…we ike them…they re incredible nice…Dr. Acosta or Dr. Baez…nice people….I remember a few weeks ago some body even accuse me that I was a person getting pay by DENTAVC…to promote them…no true…thanks God I can afford my own bills without going that low.roadadisor
"LOL roadadvisor...some cynics come to Trip Advisor. I had a very rude email from someone accusing me of working for NOVA Dental Clinic. They don't use middle men and I, like you, have no need to work for a dental clinic. I did so much research (days) before choosing a Dentist. It is my way of helping future Visitors as I was helped prior to my first trip. Fortunately there are several great clinics to choose from."
I feel a lot better now honestly obxpat….it is so insulting to have that kind of people around…they hide behind a screen name…in a very very coward way…THANK YOU …once again…roadadvisor
"Guess that is what the term ""cyber bully"" means. Ah well I find it best to just ignore them."
Thank you once again…hard sometimes to ignore some abusers…but nice to try!roadadvisor
"If you are considering dental work in Costa Rica: I originally searched the internet for Costa Rican dentists as my husband and I were going to vacation there in August for a week and I have endured overlapping front teeth all of my life and wanted to try to get them fixed while there. Before leaving the US, I emailed Adult Dentistry inquiring about them and the procedures. Dr. Jose was very quick to return my emails and answer my questions. Upon arriving in CR, I called and got an appt for consultation. Dr. Jose and his expert staff were very friendly and professional and spoke English which was a great help for me. They were able to perform the first step of my treatment (which was laser whitening) that afternoon. The equipment and expertise of both Dr. Jose and staff was exceptional. They even rescheduled their own patients for me to come in early or late so we would have most of the day to tour the area. I was very grateful. The other impressionable thing was, Dr. Jose has his own lab in-house and he made my crown, veneer and mouth guard right there. No waiting 2 weeks for a permanent crown and veneer. So, when I left CR, my 2 front teeth were straight and the bite was perfect. He and the staff even stayed til 8:30 p.m. working on me to make sure every thing was perfect and aligned correctly. The cost was ¼ of what I would have to pay in the US and the experience was pleasant. I would highly recommend anyone contacting Dr. Jose if they are going to go to Costa Rica and wish to have some dental work done. I don’t impress easily but I was very impressed with him and his staff. Thanks to all at Adult Dentistry for making me want to smile a lot now"
"I went to Dr. Anglada for some extractions, bone grafts, and one implant. I'm going back this week for 5 more implants. I've been happy with his work and the time that he takes to explain everything clearly. It was the most comfortable dental experience I've ever had."
"Hello: Looking for accredited, good dentists who are medium or low range in prices in Costa Rica. I am impressed with Nova and Meza but from what I ascertain thru the posts here, they would probably be the most expensive?"
"Nova was 30-35% of the cost I was quoted here in the US. Not sure what makes you think ""they would probably be the most expensive""? Several Clinics have been recommended in the past year here on a few Trip Advisor threads. You can choose a few, email them your proposed treatment and they can give you an approx price based upon that. I don't think i would choose to go to a ""low range"" priced dentist there."

"I recently had surgery for implants completed at Dental Cosmetics. US Phone 305-428-3820 . This clinic has two dentist. Dr Fernandez and Dr Mora. They are both excellent in their practice. I was quoted in the US for 6 implants, crowns, etc at close to $ 36000. The clinic is doing the same proceedures for a little above $ 12000. It was comfortable, no pain to speak of. They are located in Escazu right by the Hospital. I stayed at Ringle Resorts, lovely place. Cab fair 3 bucks. They are very professional, very clean, and polite. They all speak English. I highly recommend this office . Rick"
"Hey Nate, did you have any Implants in the front of your mouth? I have a need for one, want a really good outcome"
"I saw Dr. Gadea at Costa Rica Dental Services in January of this year. I got 3 crowns, 3 root canals, and a teeth cleaning. All in all the work cost me roughly $2000. The crowns are still going strong, I haven't had any issues with them, all the work was done in a week and pretty much painless (except for the teeth cleaning, it was a bit rough but man my teeth were clean). They have the same guy that does the root canals for MEZA and Prisma doing root canals for them, only the work is far cheaper from Dr. Gadea. They're friendly, the facilities are choice, and the equipment is all sterile and current. I'm very happy with the work and will be returning to Costa Rica for all of my dental work in the future."
Many good dentists down there -- I used Dr Anglada for implants etc and Dr Castro for the crowns. Started about 4 years ago and all is well! I'm heading back down for an implant before the end of the year.At least give them a chance to quote you and keep getting more referrals!Good Luck!
Another vote for Anglada. Did bone grafts sinus lifts and eight implants and return next month for trip three with the reconstruction with Castro. Anglada was amazingly kind and thorough in his explanations and has a great gentle manner in surgery. Impeccable standards in cleanliness. I understand Castro is a perfectionist. I'm sure you would do well with any of these choices. Nova and Prada were on my short list as well. I was just extremely pleased with Anglada. Best of luck to you!
"Out of all my dental experiences in the USA and Costa Rica over the past 10 years I've found the best dentist right here in Playas del Coco, Guanacaste, only 25 minutes from the Liberia international airport. His name is Ricardo Lopez. Personally I've only had old fillings replaced, cleanings and an old crown replaced, but he did them all painlessly and perfectly the first time. There are many short term rentals in Coco where you can stay and walk to his office, which is only 1 block away from the beach. Cost was $50 for the cleaning, $50 for each filling, and $400 for the crown. You can see some before and after photos of implants and other jobs he's done on his Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/LsDentalClinic/… You can see on the page others have left positive feedback about implants and other work. Their website is very helpful too - http://www.lsdentalcostarica.com/"
Thanks for this info. I had searched for a Dental Clinic to visit that was near the beaches when I first began Dental Work in CR. No One was able to offer suggestions for an Implantologist/Dental Surgeon away from the City. I knew there were several very good Dentists for General Dentistry near beaches.
"In March, 2017, I saw Dr. Arnoldo Anglada for implants. His driver met me at the airport when I arrived in San Jose. The next day I met with Dr. Anglada and he outlined his proposal for extraction and implants. I agreed and surgery was performed that afternoon. Three extractions were done and three implants were placed. There was very little pain and I slept well that night. I was given medication to take each day for pain and to prevent infection. I was provided with a temporary denture which fit well. I return to San Jose in a few months to have crowns made and fitted. Dr. Anglada and his team were professional and courteous. I believe the treatment I received was world class and the cost was a fraction of what I would have paid in the U.S."
Are you still happy with the work. We are considering this for implants for my husband

How much was your dental implants? I am considering looking into getting implants when I'm in Costa Rica
"I began work with Nova in 2012. Did exhaustive research and was very skeptical. Still happy 5 years later. Nova has done an excellent job for Myself and several Friends and Family members I referred to them since. Do Your homework and get estimates from at least 2 or 3 clinics. Be sure you are comparing apples to apples and base your decision on who to use, based on what feels ""right"" for you. I would stay away from the ""Middlemen"" who are actually Salespeople NOT Dentists. Read different reviews here on Trip Advisor and on other sites like Topix....google the Clinics. You will find a few with some horrible first hand reviews and will, obviously steer clear of those. Nova and Anglada consistently get good reviews here...recently Dr Kriebel also has popped up with excellent reviews. By going to Costa Rica for dental I discovered a Country we have now visited many times."
Where did you stay? Also how do you know when to go back for the crowns? What was the price for an implant and abatement and crown? Thanks for any advice. Went to dentist in Florida and for 2 implants it was $7000...does not include crowns or abatements. Even with my dental insurance it was $5000 just for the 2 implants.
"I went to Nova 2 years ago ,implants and crowns,...still extremely pleased...complete implants were $1500 each crowns over regular teeth were $500. Each. Most are about the same at other offices.Would go back .My local dentist was very impressed and very helpful all the way along.I was 75 years years old and concerned about health issues...hospitals are excellent and close ,it's a safe country and fun to travel around. Bruce , Ripon Ca"
"What has stopped us from seeing dentists in Costa Rica is the location of their offices. We prefer to stay either near La Fortuna or Monteverde. I know that this is asking a lot, but can anyone recommend this type of dentistry this far from San Jose?"
BruceWould you please tell me more?Which clinic? Which implantologist? I need t-2.Thank you.Llani
"I am happy to recommend Dr. Kriebel to anyone thinking about coming to Costa Rica for dental care. I was originally treated in South Carolina, but after spending more than $21,000 on implants, a 1 1/2 years later II was advised that the treatment had failed and would have to be repeated at my cost.Dr. Kriebel reviewed my x-rays, and after an initial visit, suggested a better option that would correct the botched work and would give me confidence to smile again in public. The dental work took several weeks, but the convenient scheduling allowed me to visit friends, family and Costa Rica’s amazing natural areas. The end result of the dental work is wonderful. Dr. Kriebel even scheduled a last minute appointment the day before I flew back home. I strongly recommend Mariano to anyone that requires extensive dental work with a human touch, and wants to explore Costa Rica, but doesn’t want to pay the elevated costs associated with dental work in the US.Jeanette Martinson, Aiken SC"
"Dr. Anglada set the implants in March and everything was fine, so I returned to Costa Rica in October to have my dental work completed by Dr. Eduardo Castro. Castro is a courteous gentleman who is meticulous in his work. Their driver picked me up at the airport and took me to the El Sesteo hotel across the street from the dental office. Dr. Juliana Castro Lapeira oversaw the final positioning and alignment of my new teeth and made sure that everything was perfect. To summarize, I had five teeth extracted and replaced with implants and a bridge. Two trips to CR were required and I saved a bundle. The work seems to me to be very good and the new teeth look normal. I'm very pleased. Thank you.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I just finished extensive dental work at Nova Dental. Dr. Obando and staff exceeded all my expectations. Nova Dental is a state of the art facility and the Marriott Escazu is literally steps from their office. The dental office and hotel are located within a short walk to ~5 restaurants. I had 4 extractions, 3 root canals, 10 crowns and 4 dental implants and 3 trips to Costa Rica for half the cost of the work in the U.S. I highly recommend Nova Dental. The entire process was seamless from airport pick up, hotel drop-off, office visits, dental treatment plan, etc."
"After visiting several Dentist in South Florida I decided to go to Costa Rica to get dental work done. I selected Dental work in San Jose, Costa Rica. I choose Denta Vac here is thier website https://dentavac.com/ Dr. Ramirez did my two root canals and Dr. Gabriela Sibaja prepared my crowns. The office is high tech and both of these doctors have me as a patient for life. I am 60 years old and have been to many dentist over my life and sincerely these two are better then I have every had in the USA. I was nervous since I had waited so long one tooth had an infection so I was anticipating that tooth was going to be painful to do the root canal but to my surprise Dr. Ramirez was excellent! And this office offers pick up service from the airport to your hotel and ride service to the appointment. Dr. Sibaja English is perfect don't worry if your Spanish is poor or in my case nonexistent. I am going to come back and have these Doctor give me the smile I've always wanted at I price this senior can afford."
"The best dentist, ever!Just returned from my 4th visit with Dr. Castro-Sittenfeld at the Clinica Integral y Estetica Dental (CLEO DENTAL). Four years ago, I was looking for affordable dental care outside of the U.S., since preventive dental care here was out of the question due to cost. In Costa Rica, I found the perfect Dental Practice by reading many reviews, and also by the recommendation of a local plastic surgeon. The Clinica Integral y Estetica Dental is a Dental Clinic managed by Dr. Arnoldo Anglada, a dental surgeon and implant specialist, and by Dr. Eduardo Castro, an orthodontist for crowns and bridges, who earned his graduate degree at the NYU Dental Clinic in New York City; Dr. Irene Salgado is their root-canal specialist. You can reach them at the U.S Tel: 954-703-5010; or Costa Rica Tel: 506-2232-0105. You can find them at their web site: CLEO DENTAL, SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA The dental office picked me up at the airport and brought me to my hotel to check in and then to Dr. Castro for a check-up and cleaning. I needed crowns replaced and my bite slightly adjusted. Dr. Castro is a very sensitive dentist who made sure that I was never in pain! Their lab is in-house, which makes it easy for quick and necessary changes. It takes 5 days, Monday - Friday, to replace crowns, including a quick visit on Friday to even out the bite, if necessary.I can truly say that Dr. Eduardo Castro provides the very best dental care I have ever experience in my 76 years of life! Crowns $490 - pay cash in US $ (with a 5 year guarantee!) Cleaning and X-rays $90."
"I only have experience with Dr Obando so I cannot comment on other CR dentists. I had to have all my natural teeth removed along with removal of several implants that were very infected and failing. Dr O removed the teeth, did bone grafts, 8 new implants, and finally placed permanent upper and lower zirconium bridges.Since my procedure was complicated and long, Nova sent me to Cima a nearby hospital to be examined by a MD to make sure I could go under anesthesia and the surgery was performed by a licensed Anesthesiologist who was present during the entire surgery. I am 73 and have ITP (which means I bleed easily).The surgery was a success and I could not be happier. Having spent most of my life in dental chairs, I can tell you Nova is as good as if not better than what you can get in the US.Edited: 2 years ago "
I need to all back teeth up & down replaced. Is there discount for implants with bridges. I was told its reasonably priced in CR but I need alot of work done
"I suggest getting a consultation and sending x-rays? That's what I did with Nova and had a great experience. Right off the plane I went to the office. It was around 6pm or so. Was done at around 8:30. Very nice dentist and staff, clean office. THe only issue I had was the issue of my bank stopping payment when I got to Costa Rica. All and all, great time."
"Great info! I am thinking about going there for my dental work, implants, crowns and root canal, just cant afford it here. How do you go about all the pre treatment stuff? My issue is time as I cannot afford to take much time off work so I would like to be able to get in asap and get the work started. I wouldn't have a clue where or how to start."
Nova Dental and Dr. Obando and his staff are the best. Started at another dental practice in CR and left for many reasons. Only wish I had started with Nova. Such a different experience than the first provider.
"I got pre op testing done in US. Had implants - went in on a sunday, surgery on monday, left on saturday. Go to NOVA - they are the best! Started at another clinic that was the worst - wish I had started at NOVA. Dr. Obando is a rock star!"

"We had work done by Obando and it was top notch. We were there in June and are going back to have the work finished in November. He is not that young. His staff is very efficient and we feel we got great care. I would recommend to anyone. We live in the DC area and the work here would have been $18,000. Our total cost for the dental work is $4700. We have made two fun trip out of it. The dental office is near the Marriott in Escazu, which is a safe suburb. We stay at the Villas del Rio and use Uber to get around."
NOVA dental/Dr. Obando was great. I highly recommend.
"I am having extensive dental work done at Costa Rica Dental, Dr Marcos Munoz-Cavalini. High praise for this clinic. First class work. They take good care of you from the time you step off the plane until you return Dr Munoz was trained in Kansas City and works under his father. The cost is less than half of that in the states even when you add in travel expenses. I am at the clinic now"

"Who was the first provider, may I ask? I was recommended Morera Fujiwara in Alajuela, but outside od his facebook reviews, I'm having a hard time finding any information."
"I find it odd any Professional would feel ""threatened"" by a bad review on Trip Advisor? Camille, never heard of that Provider? Hope someone will pitch in with more on them. I'll be going to NOVA next week for another visit. Been going there since 2012 with no problems and only great experiences at a very reasonable cost."
"Agreed. Morera Fujiwara came highly recommended by Anywhere.com, who I booked my last visit to beautiful Costa Rica with. I'm having a very difficult time deciding between them and Nova. Dr Morera, who I've been communicating with the last few days via email, has been wonderful, but it is hard to find any information about the quality, long-term, of his services. He does offer a 7 year warranty on all of his work."
"I've personally had dental work done in Costa Rica; both implants with bridges and a whole bunch of crowns. I was completely happy with the work and extremely thankful to have found a friend in Bob Reardon out of Atlanta, dba as Costa Rican Dental. He's a gem! I saved at least 50% of what all this work would've cost in the states, and that includes the cost of air travel and hotel. I'm about to go back for some more work without any qualms."
"I used Costa Rica Dental services. Had two visits, one in January and the most recent this past July. I had 8 implants, 2 root canals, replaced a 4 tooth bridge and placed crowns on 11 teeth. Dr. Gadea is a master at his craft and properly the best dentist ever. I just went to my dentist in states for cleaning and a check up and he stated my work was properly the best he has ever seen in his 25 years practicing dentistry. He stated my completed restoration is like a painting by Michael Angelo. I am so passionate about telling people about my dental experence in Costa Rica beacuse in the USA the cost is prohibitive so you are left to suffer without any chance of resolution unless you second mortgage your home to pay for it. I have no agenda other then educating people on dental toursim in CR and more importantly Costa Rica Dental Services.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Can you tell me how payment is made, credit card? wire transfer? I will be spending approximately $7000 and would not dream of carrying that kind of cash."
"Can you tell me how payment is made, credit card? wire transfer? I will be spending approximately $7000 and would not dream of carrying that kind of cash.In addition, is it possible to enjoy some of the adventures, zip line, nature excursions etc in between dental appointments? Concerned about the pain between visits spoiling things? I am having root canals and crowns done."
Wire transfer is the same as cash for them. I believe you should receive 4% of the total bill for paying cash.
"At Nova Dental I was able to wire transfer funds from my Bank Of America acct to theirs. Another time my Husband who was Stateside, Merely went to BOA and deposited a ck into their acct. I received a 5% cash discount! As for side trips...so many options. One visit I went to Alturas de Puriscal for 2 nights in the Country and Horseback Riding. One trip to Puerto Viejo to the beach and Jaguar Rescue Center for 3 nights (that trip I needed to be at Nova Mon and Fri only). Even the days of an appt if your appt is in the morning You can visit Zoo Ave in Alajuela (an animal rescue with outdoor animal habitats) or Finca Caballo Loco in nearby Ciudad Colon for an afternoon of horseback riding. Toucan Rescue Ranch for a tour up close with a rare oncilla, multiple monkeys, numerous sloths (babies to seniors), many birds of CR, kinkajous and more! Downtown San Jose boasts a lively central mercado to visit, a gold and a jade museum! Google tours from San Jose. Many options"
I am planning on getting implants (upper and lower).I would like to have an estimate and also need to ask questions about my personal condition.I would like to fly from Minnesota to Costa Rica this coming June.How long is recovery and how long does a patient stay there.
"Every Patient and their needs are unique! Same will hold true for length of visit and ""recovery"". For me, I needed to stay a min of five days M-F my first visit. I have a friend who had an entire mouth restoration who needed to be there 2 weeks. You need to get a Proposed Treatment Plan from Your Dentist. Then contact Clinics You choose to request estimates etc. If You have xrays they can be emailed. If not no worries. They need to know the scope of what you need done to answer the ?s. I email Nova and Dr Obando emails me back within a couple of days. No middleman. They offer assistance with lodging, transportation etc if You wish. Not necessary as it is easy to book yourself online. Still if you prefer help it is at no charge"
Can you please tell me the name of the hotel you stayed at? I have an appointment to see Dr. Arnoldo Anglada soon and I would like to possibly stay there. Thank you.

It is walking distance from Cima Hospital and Avenida Escazu . State of the art equipment and gracious personnel from the dentists to receptionist, Karen I was treated well.

"COSTA RICA DENTAL LAB clinicDo not rush and jump on the airplane to go for cheaper dental in Costa Rica I went there, and I paid the price They do not follow the procedure they do not have the latest equipment, they do not care about your comfort, I went there after checking out my teeth they said I have to do two implants on the lower right jaw and four implant on the upper left jaw in the same week I ask how I am going to chew their response is to eat soft food for three month and this is the first sign about their practice they do not care about your comfort and no Dentist will do it and I found out that they charge my c.c for the whole job before I start I hand to cancel and do two implantsThe Doctor he start drilling without taking an X-ray for reference depth and angle during drilling he hit a nerve I told him about he said it will go in three weeks then he took an X-ray he could tell tell or see it was over expose and his X-ray is the first generation he had to take three X-ray and still not clear so I left in pain and my right Jaw is num I have call them they never replied or answering their phone or checking up on meBe careful of this people you can find in the states implants for about $2000They gave me antibiotic tablet about 30 tablets for over $115, I googled the medication the whole box cost $21 the gave me half a box loos it is complete rip offI came back to the states went to a surgeon he referred me to UNIVERSITY OF San Francisco he does not want to touch it Then I went to another dentist for a different opinion and the same story he cannot touch my implant because there is a nerve damage  Stay away from this clinic COSTA RICA DENTAL LABIt is a house in the residential area converted to a clinic"
"I am sorry to hear of your experience in Costa Rica. I began doing my research about three years ago. I read everything I could find on the subject of medical/dental treatment abroad. I listened to podcasts. I reviewed everything written about dental work in Costa Rica. Then I went and visited three different practices before choosing one. I found the three to be modern, well equipped, fluent in English and willing to answer all my questions. Six months later I came back to CR and had the work I discussed with the practice done. I am more than satisfied and it was not unrealistically painful. For me, it was a choice between living with bad teeth that presented a health hazard or having work done abroad. I have a friend that has lived all over Asia and had work done there with good results. Prices are ridiculous in the US and the practice I used, the dentists were trained in the West at universities everyone knows. They were accommodating and concerned about my care even my safety. I did not require pain pills after the anesthesia wore off and was able to enjoy time zip lining with my daughter.You can have work done even in the US and have a bad experience or bad results. And you can have good results someplace else. People that have to live abroad for work etc do not fly home every time they need medical or dental work. But you still have to do a lot of work before making the decision. Maybe you did do the homework and picked wrong unfortunately, but I jumped on the plane and I can recommend where I went and what I paid allowed me to have something done I never would have been able to afford so I feel differently than you do. But many people have shared the same experience as I have so I want you to know that and people considering going abroad, costs rica or somewhere else should not necessarily be scared off by your experience. But everyone must be careful and deliberate before they go."
Dr Jose? Is that his name? I can’t find him- can you tell me more?
Thanks for sharing your experience with DentaVac. I just booked an appointment with them for next week - do you have any recommendations for places to stay?
I visited Nova dental in Escazu near Cima Hospital. I stayed at an Airbnb in Escazu adjacent to Avenida Escazu. The apartment complex had security guards and cameras and was called Milano apartments. Look for Pablo and Beatriz Melo's airbnb. I am aware of some safety problems in Costa Rica for tourists so be careful. I used Ubers there with no problem.
I used Nova dental near Cima Hospital in Escazu. It was across from a Marriott Courtyard. I had two root canals and a set of crowns across the top. I spent a few hours on three occasions to get everything done. I am home now and everything is good. I am not afraid to smile anymore.
how much did implant with crown cost you
I used Novadental
"I am ready to pull the trigger. Looks like I will use Nova. There are so many fabulous reviews and they seem to be very modern and professional.I am looking for full upper restoration Dr. Orbano, suggest all on 6.Now I wait for an appointment . Any reason to worry about deposit, I plan to use Visa cc?Where to stay, I am on a budget. Hope to find a B&B. Depends on appointment but I can get a RT United flight from Little Rock for $415.Thank you in advance"
I believe NOVA has lodging recommendations on their website. If not email and ask for a list. Hotel Christina is the choice of many and has very good reviews. The B&B where I enjoyed staying on my dental visits has since closed as the Owner retired. It is nice to find a studio or small apt so You have cooking facilities and a freezer for ice packs after surgery. Ask if You can get a cash discount by depositing into Nova's Bank of America acct. The cash discount applies in that case. I had my husband (who was home) deposit a ck. Another visit when He was also in CR we just did a wire transfer upon completion of the work. Simple. Nova is happy to answer any of Your questions and make the travel worry free.
Where does Dr. Menza practice...what is the name of his clinic. I am trying to decide where to go for a bone graft and an implant.Thank you!
"I live south of Atlanta, Ga and need, at the least right now, a dental implant. I want to go to Costa Rica to have it done but need some input...can you tell me which dentist you used? I am trying to figure out which would help provide the best outcome. Thank You!"
"skippee - the thread you posted in has 80 contributions...There are plenty of others that discuss dentists at length, some longer, some shorter:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29198…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30929…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30929…"
"I had four implants and six crowns done by Dr. Clare Castro at Colina Clinic. I was originally very happy with the work that was done. The Colina Clinic is very modern using the best of modern technologies. However, within a couple of months I had to return to Costa Rica to have an implant tightened. It had come so loose it was wobbling in I could not chew on it. It was an easy one hour procedure to fix it, but for me that meant a flight to Costa Rica and a night in a hotel. Now I am having more problems. I emailed the clinic describing the problem. The answer I got was obviously meant for a different patient. I was disappointed that they had not even looked at my patient record before responding.My caution to anyone considering going to Colina Clinic is to consider the problems involved in ongoing care if you have any complications. The original work I had done seemed fine, my initial interactions with Dpctor Clare Castro and Ana were very friendly and positive, but for later care, I was not treated so well. The cost of additional trips to Costa Rica and the fact that you cannot get questions answered easily are negative aspects of the decision. Previously I was a very enthusastic proponent of traveling to Costa Rica for dental care, now I am not so sure.Edited: 1 year ago "
Stay away from Meza Dental. I had the worst experience there. There are so many problems with a full mouth restoration I cannot even count. From telling me I had caps which I later found out were veneers to gaps and teeth that they left glued togeather which had to be replaced. They have a video explaining how they re-imburse for work done to correct their work. Would not give me one dime. four veneers and one cap came loose. I have had caps for 25 yrs that did not come loose. Once they take your money watch out

"I can only speak for myself but I have had a great experience with Nova dental in Escazu. I have been back home for over a month and my work is holding up fine. I believe there have been some administrative changes in Meza dental and they are the most expensive practice out there, comparable to the US. I went to Costa Rica to get work done that I could not afford to do in the US. I have read reviews of other dentists I would also have tried. These dentists have a high number of foreign clients and domestic clients with insurance so I have more confidence will produce good results."
"Prices vary greatly here, and I've seen guarantees vary from 3-10 years. But guaranteeing the work doesn't mean much if a clinic can't do satisfactory work in the first place or won't honor their guarantee. Be very cautious, get everything about satisfaction and guarantee in writing before making any payment. Don't believe that nice friendly clinic will stay that way when you're not easily satisfied."
"My ""Nice Friendly Clinic"" Nova recently stood by my initial work six years later! I had a crown come off and it had a hairline crack. I planned to just have it fixed at home when I emailed Dr Obando for implant info He immediately offered to replace it at zero cost. They asked for no pictures, etc. I went over, had it replaced and was charged nothing. Opted to have xrays, ck up and cleaning for $70 Total Charge. That would Not happen with My US dentist!!"

I am not anything more than a satisfied customer. We all have our opinions and our own experiences. I don't think you should cast doubt on someone else experiences. If you have had trouble with a clinic thats your experience but if wasn't mine or obxpat.
"Not ""Free Work"" just standing behind their work. Something anyone can read over and over on reviews of Nova by many Posters. I like to give credit where credit is due."
"I have to wonder how many of these rave reviews are true and not influenced by dentists. Every time i warn users, someone immediately gets my post removed but it usually shows up again before long. Now my post informing others about the complaint process has been removed! WHY??? What's wrong with informing others of the appropriate course of action when they believe they were ripped off by a clinic?!"
"Again, protect yourself in case of problems by using a credit card, get accurate documentation regarding what you have paid for and terms, and never pay more than 50% until you are satisfied. The governing body for dentistry is Colegio de Cirujanos Dentistas de Costa Rica. They will try to mediate if there are problems, and I read somewhere that they can suspend a dentists' license to practice until resolution. Their website is in Spanish so you might need to use google translate or have help in making your complaint."

What dentist did you use?vagabondxyz
Giving people advice on what to do if they indeed have issues is good but constantly casting doubt on the truthfulness or authenticity of people who gave positive experiences is insulting . One might wonder what your agenda is. Are you just against going abroad for medical or dental work? I am just someone who had a good experience. I received no special benefit to express my opinion honestly.
"Pamela R I am hoping the less we respond to negativity the less interest this Poster will have in continuing to ""rant"" on Trip Advisor. Anyone who takes time to Genuinely research Dentistry in CR can take the Constructive advice as we did, do some homework and benefit from the Excellent opportunities offered at terrific prices. The Insinuation that any of Us are Paid to promote Clinics is laughable. When someone is a ""Plant"" on TA it is so simple to just click on their Profile. Most will have posts on a variety of Locations, topics and experiences with travel. When/If a Poster solely comes to TA to promote or to bash one business with no other posts, I disregard that info. Even more laughable is the fact that We get ""Free Work"" done. My Dental Team is unaware of the Trip Advisor activity. They have more than enough Testimonials on their website from very satisfied Patients. The Above Average Clinics also have plenty of Customers daily and hardly have to troll this forum for more."
"I returned from San Jose, CR in November 2018 after completing my dental work. I waited to review so I could make sure I was still satisfied with the results, and I am! I love that I can now Smile! I did a lot of research because I had previously gone to Tamarindo for my first procedures. I didn't return there since they have no labs to expedite the work needed. I chose Dr. Arnoldo Anglada for dental implants in May, 2018 and returned 6 months later for the crowns by his partner, Dr Eduardo Castro. I also got 8 veneers and a bridge. I am extremely happy with all the work I had done. They speak English and were very patient with all my questions and fears. They charged 1/3 of the cost I was quoted by 3 dentists in my city. (St.Louis,MO) I would be happy to answer any questions by messaging me here on Trip Advisor."
I hope readers trying to find a good dental clinic are reading the other topics on dental care. I've recently read negative reviews in the Costa Rica forum about both Nova and Meza.
I visited Meza dental and they are in San Jose and the most expensive practice in Costa Rica. I also visited Nova dental in Escazu which was more moderately priced and I had the work done there. I am home and have been very satisfied with what I had done. I felt safe in Escazu personally but would not have felt so staying in San Jose. There is some crime and drug activity to be aware of . But the Escazu area is easy to navigate and more English speaking people there.
Thank you for that response. What clinic and Dr did you choose and for what services please?
Where did you see the reviews? What topic? Meza is one Cli̇ni̇c I am considering for veneers. Any input?
Do a search on dental and Meza in the search area. Or look thru topics on dentistry for the last couple of months. #85 in this topic for Meza review.Edited: 1 year ago 
What dentist did you see
ARE you still on this thread? I have questions about the dental work in CR. I need a full mouth restoration by capping/crowning all teeth due to loss of vertical dimension from grinding.
Who are you asking? What questions do you have?
What is the approximate cost for a total smile makeover?
"Every Patient is unique. Some need sinus lifts, jaw bone implant, extractions etc. You should contact a few Clinics with Your Personal Proposed Treatment Plan for the Professional's price quotes."
Any feedback on DaVinci dental for porcelain veneers. It was recommended by a local from Costa Rica.
I recommend www.stardentalimplant.com Star Dental Implant Center. The Dr is Dr. Carlos Sevilla. He has a specialty in Prosthodontics from Texas A&M's Baylor College of Dentistry where he was an Assistant Professor. I had an implant done because of an infection that developed from poor treatement at another clinic. He's highly recommended.
"#117, Beppi, you can sue the dentists in CR but not easy. I'm in the process of getting a negotiation meeting at Colegio de Cirujanos Dentistas de Costa Rica in San Jose with the clinic who refused to honor their 5-year guarantee or provide any refund when the bridge broke off less than 2 years later. The negotiation request form had to be completed in Spanish and submitted in person or thru CR attorney. I found a local thru a friend who charged $8 for the translation and plans to go to the meeting with me as translator."
"@123, Good luck! Did they explain to you why they were not honoring their own guarantee? If the negotiations do not produce desired results, do you know if your clinic or dentist carry malpractice insurance?"
"Dentists in this country do not carry malpractice insurance. Dental clinic I'm referring to is dishonest, tho they sound good on their website."
"Sorry to say, I guess my long contributions where deleted because a competitor of the dentist clinic I visited squashed my great dental experience with the clinic and the B&B I had. Pretty sad, since I only wrote my experience, observations and communications with other Dental-Tourists.Edited: 1 year ago "
"If you really like to get a pain-free dental experience, myself 3 implants, 1 a molar, then see Colina, Esacazu, San Jose, Best dental experience I ever had. Except I had to eat soft-food after extractions and setting the posts.Otherwise I would have never known that I just came from the dentist.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Beppi, i don't understand why your posts were deleted. Sorry you spent so much time trying to inform others for nothing. I've had my posts on dental topics removed, often almost instantly, but they often reappeared a couple of days later. It appears that some contributors or dental clinics have special treatment from TA so can have others' posts removed. I've had problems getting dental work done here, and guess that TA doesn't like my negative comments."
"@117, the reason I asked is because some do not carry it, probably many, but I thought some did."
"beppi, I didn't have a chance to read Your posts. Typically a post is removed because it does not follow Trip Advisor guidelines. If Your posts did, I would contact TA and ask why? Readers often come here to gain knowledge before contacting specific clinics. It was a huge help to me finding Trip Advisor when I began my search for dental work. Of course that is only when Contributors Name the Clinic they had good or bad experiences with. Seems You were very pleased with Colina and I have seen positive reviews of them often. I don't think any of the well known and regarded clinics has time to ""monitor"" trip advisor much less ask that posts be removed.Edited: 1 year ago "
"@ Post 122:Thanks for your reply obxpat. I did not think my post would not conform with the guidelines of TA and the review was deleted because somebody by the community complained, not by TA staff. Yet, I also think that one clinic (US owners) in CR is very aggressive in advertisement and trying to protect their ""turf"", so they think. :) Since I created my review first in a RTF, I will split it up in 7 pieces and then try to post again and see what happens. :)"
"#123, I haven't thought that any of the dental clinics here are aggressively advertising their clinic, wondering why you have that opinion. I believe TA reviews any posts that the TA community requests to have removed which is why mine usually but not always reappear."
"#122 obxpat, i was warned by one clinic that i could wind up in jail if i posted a negative review on TA. I am also prohibited by refund agreements from posting negative reviews on TA. I will post a positive review from the dental clinic that finally does esthetic dental work to my satisfaction."
"@125, ""...i was warned by one clinic that i could wind up in jail if i posted a negative review on TA"". What legal basis did they give you for such a threat?"
Libel.
"The definition of libel is ""a published false statement"". False."
And a dental clinic could claim true negative report is false. I've heard of a few times posters who wrote negative reviews on TA have ended up with legal problems.
"That is crazy! I have made both Positive and Negative Reviews on TA for years! Everyone is free to post what they wish and not what they don't. People come here for Help and input about travel and specific clinics. I have seen Plenty of negative posts the fit the posting criteria not removed. One in particular has been here for years now!! I think Goodness Dental ( a newer name to me in the past year) has had Many Posts suddenly appear. Some in the beginning, I personally was suspect of. I did see the lg shiny bldg on a trip to Escazu in November. Signs are everywhere one looks on street corners not even close to the Clinic. I know nothing about it. First Clinic I've seen blatantly advertise, guess it works for them."
"@129, @130:See what it says that Yelp posts on the site of businesses that try to sue clients for posting their opinions and experiences- https:/… ."
"#131, thanks for the info. The dental clinic that warned me said I was not in the USA and the legal system is different here. Probably just trying to scare me. Not worth the risk to me to post negative reviews of dental clinics that readers may not even take seriously. And now my previous posts on this topic today have been removed. Somebody doesn't like me warning others about dental clinics here.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Beppi, TA may have thought you were working for a dentist due to your numerous long posts and lack of posts on other topics. My guess is the message about the TA community deeming a post inappropriate is a generic message TA routinely uses when deleting posts."
"Sometimes the TA says, ""TripAdvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet TripAdvisor's forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.We ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.To review the TripAdvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guideli…We remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.""Or""-:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:-TripAdvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet TripAdvisor's forum guideline with regards to harassment of another user.

So sometimes a more specific reason seems to be pasted."
Star Dental Implant Center is pretty good. They're lead Dr. is Carlos Sevilla. He has a specialty in Prosthodontics from Texas A&M's Baylor College of Dentistry and they're located inside Cima Hospital which is JCI accredited. I've had several crown done with him with great results.https://stardentalimplant.com/
"I praised the 2 businesses because the service received was just outstanding and taught they deserve my review her on TA. Also only reason why I joined TA a view days ago. It was my first trip to Costa Rica,and taught I write about my experience with Colina and B&B Posada el Quijote. No affiliation from my end. Just an additional thank you to them with a post here."
"Hi there- I had 7 implants, bone graft and sinus lift in December 2018. I go back again in June to get the crowns. Dr. Arnoldo Angalda was my oral surgeon/implant specialist and I am so happy with the entire process so far. I was incredibly concerned and did a lot of research, too. Dr. Anglada gave me a direct line and I spoke to him twice and had several email exchanges while still in the States. I arrived in CR at midnight and his driver picked me up (there is a great Holiday Inn next door practically, I was traveling alone) I met with Dr. Anglada prior to surgery and discussed options and details again to assuage any fears (I had none at this point) and answer any questions. The staff is very professional, has very high standards and, although I am not qualified as a clinician, I think Dr. Anglada is an implant genius. He works swiftly, is very precise (he actually took a Pano mid-surgery just to be satisfied with placement.) and is greatly concerned about sterile environment. I saw him at least 3 times during my 6 day stay, whatever it took - it's included, no surprise charges. The thing is, his work is literally under wraps, you can't see the results. I think that the foundation is crucial for all-over success, and Dr. Anglada has mad skills in this area. He LOVES what he does. He looked at the x-ray post-surgery, and stated, ""I love this image!"" It was like a Rembrandt to him : ) He is also very kind and attentive, as is every single staff member there. He works with Dr. Eduardo Castro, who will finish in June. I have great confidence in Dr. Castro due to the amazing skill and care of Dr. Anglada and crew. I'm happy to answer any questions for you!"
"I too went to Dr. Anglada and Dr. Castro last year. Had several implants, crowns and veneers with great result. I felt the same way about their work as you do. Feel so lucky I chose them."
"just got back from Costa Rica for dental work..used Dr. Marco Munoz Cavallini..live in florida..quoted in fla work would cost over $12,000.00,,need 2 extractions,3 crowns etc..cost in costa rica $4200.00..and they did a Fabulous job..contactdentalcostarica@gmail.co..very professional and the caring I can't be positive enough..m y wife had 2 extractions and 2 two stage implants and a sinus lift for $3250.00..on the implants we will have to go back in 6months to have the teeth put in...I also advise that there is a lot of waiting so be prepared, we stayed at their attached guest house which made the waiting bearable because you could wait in your room till they called..bring books and a lap top if possible to entertain yourself..the room was comfortable had a tv with some english channels...and food delivery was easy...again five stars"
"I have been a patient at DentaVac for the past 15 years as I live here in Costa Rica. Their work is excellent, have never had to have anything re-done. Recently had a 3 D printed crown, the best experience I've ever had with a crown. They put it in to see if it fit, it was perfect, they glued it and I went home and have been thoroughly happy with it for the past year already. Don't hesitate to go to DentaVac."
I can see right through you
No one in Costa Rica to force a US citizen into a Costa Rica Court. Sounds like manipulation fear tactics to prevent people from posting negative reviews.
How do they handle the pain afterwards with extensive dental work? I had heard they only give ibuprofren.
"In my experience, before surgery I was given a prescription for an anti inflammatory, an antibiotic and a pain pill prior to the appt for extraction/implants...The anti inflammatory really helped. I only needed the painkiller for the initial night and next day as the pain was not really that bad. I took ibuprophen with me and used that later."
"I have no idea how to get started with this, but I am about to have 2 implants, a sinus lift, 4 crowns and a 4-tooth bridge. I am terrified of the cost. I heard Costa Rica had great dentists and much more reasonable costs. I have never flown into a foreign country, and don't know the procedures. Can someone give me advice?"
"Go online, read as much info as you can to try to determine which dentists you want to consider. Just send them an email describing what you need done. They prefer you send your xrays in the email. Ask for an estimate. Most will provide some recommendations for lodging. Be very thorough with your research. There are excellent dentists in CR, and some terrible ones. My family has experience with Dr Anglada and Dr Castro who are in practice together, and Dr Obando (Nova Dental). I would highly recommend them. There are other excellent dentists, though. Good luck!"
What was the outcome of the negotiation?
"I am not sure what happened, but I went to Dr. Castro last March based on a recommendation. And now need to have all the work redone! I went for crowns and a bridge. It felt like assembly line dentistry to me and I was at the clinic for hours. One day I was there from 8:30AM until 5:30 PM. I am in major pain from their work. On a recent visit locally, I was told my gums are still inflamed, and most of the crowns have to be replaced. On top of that, a tooth was destroyed that was the anchor for a bridge. I could go on and on, but it was an awful experience. I will be returning to have all the work redone elsewhere. (Two temporary bridges that were made stayed on less than a few days.) Just be very careful where you go!"
"I am traveling from Florida, an older woman that still wants a good time when I travel . Is there any one place or another that I would enjoy. I’m into scenic. I know I need a full arch on six. Plus 2 lower implants where there are two missing molars. A lot of work."
"I have enjoyed staying close to Escazu ""centro"". It is up on the mountainside above San Jose. I can take a taxi and be at Nova Dental from there in ten minutes. Alternately you can stroll down to the town and take a bus to multiplaza mall for about 75cents. From there a taxi for $2US. Centro has a lovely local feria (farmer's mkt) every Sat. Fun to walk through. Purchase fresh OJ, pastries, local cheese, papusas etc Since I like to rent a studio/apt I also buy lots of fresh fruit. Prices are excellent. In the mornings you can walk down and have a cup of coffee and lots of small bakeries (panaderias) and watch the town come alive. Casona de Laly and Posada de las Brujas are locally owned restaurants. Freshly prepared and reasonably priced meals. Almost always you'll find local families enjoying both. The green parrots chatter in the park each day. This is not the ""shiny"" Americanized Escazu you'll find down by the Highway. There you can find many higher end restaurants and American ""Chain"" hotels. Airbnb as well as vrbo.com and trip advisor offer good options for lodging."

"Leonore, did you find a dentist? My family (2 daughters, my husband and brother) has been to Dr Anglada and Castro for implants,crowns and root canals, and to Dr Obando (Nova Dental), also for implants and crowns. Experience with both clinics was overwhelmingly positive and the dental work has held up over time. I provided the first response on this thread 4 years ago so will not repeat myself, but I highly recommend both practices and am planning to return to CR for dental work soon. There are a lot of excellent dentists in CR, and a few that are not good, so do your research!"
Please can you tell me the post surgical experience for dental implants from dr arnold angalada and dr vairos Thank you

"I had multiple extractions, 4 implants and large bone grafting in August 2019 with Dr Anglada. I will return in Feb for two additional implants. Then 4/6 months later for final crowns/bridge. Good experience so far, no post op pain, very minimal swelling. I feel very confident with this Dr. The only negative at this point is the temp flipper I have to wear. Will update after all work is completed.Edited: 11:34 pm, October 29, 2019 "
"What dentist/clinic did you use? Was this for the All on 4 procedure?thank you,"
"greetings jajohnston, Would you share in which facility Dr. Anglada works? the town? Thank you. I was issued a ""flipper"" a few years ago to replace a single tooth. These gadgets are very useful. some people wear them for very long periods, when single implants are not desired. Thanks for helping others with your details :)"
"I am just reurning to the dental conversation here. Of I have not thanked you prior for your post, I do now! I read other posts that reommend Dr.Obando and Dr. Anglada."
"Lenora A - He is in Santa Ana Centro Comercial blvd Lindora, San Jose, CREdited: 11:52 am, November 21, 2019 "
Thank you jaJohnaston. So many clinics to choose from. I went to Prisma yesterday for a paid consultation. Am narrowing down where to have the work done. My case is VERY complex bone issues. Am interested whether anyone on this forum has had a BLOCK BONE GRAFT done?
"Lenora,Of all the really outstanding dentists in San Jose, I am curious. Why would you be considering Prisma?"
"I would ask the same question as btfan? Good You are doing Your Homework. After reading many reviews I did not opt to consult even by email with Prisma. I had a Close Friend I referred to Nova have quite a bit of bone graft to His lower jaw. I think it's about 3 years out and He has been nothing but happy. In fact, He has a testimonial on their website. Nova also just purchased some amazing new equipment. The only Clinic in Central America to have it. I would encourage you to look at their Website for a lot of info. Can't say if His was BLOCK Bone Graft or not. He needed 16 implants so it was extensive work."
"Leonore, Dr Obando and Dr Anglada are both licensed Implantologists. Implants, bone grafts and sinus lifts are all they do, all day long. Looking at the website of the CR dental licensing board, it looks like Cordero, at Prisma has had some continuing education or courses in implants, but he is a general dentist. If you want to know if either Anglada or Obando do block bone grafts, send them an email and ask them. They are both highly ethical and will tell you the truth."
"I did consider Prisma, but have 2nd thoughts. Pros: Excellent reputation. Was introduced in the clinic to two Foridians who had extensive beautiful work done. they explained in details theo wmohts of work they underwent. Modern facilities. They work as team. Lab on site. Expensive, probably due to quality of work, attention to detail. For privacy reasons I cant describe here why I believe the treatment plan Prisma write for me is good. Every case is unique. Mine involves removal of many teeth due to mobility. Dentistry needs to address stabilizing WHAT IS. Ripping out what is, is soon old school. I know two people who had excellent experiences with Prisma. Their situation involves single implants/ crowns etc. I have appointments with two other ""clinics""."
Hi btlfan: Thank you for recommending that I email them.
hi obxpat: Wearing a flipper? That the easy part! ;-) thank you for writing. Will contact Nova now as well.
"Wearing a flipper?? I don't understand. Anyway, wishing You the best as You make Your decision. It was very difficult for Me to trust a Dentist in A ""Foreign"" Country. I did a ton of research. Even when I headed to CR I was not sure I would go through with it. Wow. What a surprise I had at Nova. Kind, empathetic. Professionals explain clearly treatment options and work diligently to accommodate Patients who travel there within their time frame. I have never been so at ease in a Dental Office. We laugh because I actually look forward to going there now. The Clinic is immaculate. I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my scheduled appointment. Time means a lot to Me and I cannot imagine waiting hours beyond a scheduled appointment. Nothing is too much for the Staff when it comes to helping Patients. I have the highest respect for them."
"Hi obxpat: I referred to the ""flipper"", as it was mentioned by a commentator in this conversation, thought it was you. Sorry. I am in CR since a week, meeting dental specialists, making contacts, learning how to get around with buses. I am staying in the mountains w. friends beyond Atenas, Central CR. Its relatively easy and cheap to get around by bus, speaking Spanish helps. I too wonder whether i might go home without dental treatment. Went to the NOVA website, found there ""Alveoloplasty"" as one of their specialities, a new term for me; read posts about this on https://dentaldorks.com. Important info to know. thxs 4 ur good wishes."
"Leonore,It sounds like Prisma must have cleaned up their act considerably over the last few years since I have been out of the CR dental loop. I am not sure I would agree, however, that their expensive price is due to superior quality. It could be, but another explanation is consistent with what was previously reported by numerous people on the Topix forum and others several years ago, and was confirmed by a fellow I met at an Airbnb where I was staying 4 years ago. They used to have a reputation for quoting one price, but once you get to CR, they start finding other things wrong and by the time they are done with you, you end up paying about what you’d pay in the States. I met a Prisma patient 4 years ago who seemed happy with the work Prisma was doing. I asked if he was paying what was quoted to him before he arrived. He said the only change was they discovered he needed a root canal. I thought that could be a legitimate finding once they examined him. The only problem was, he said they were charging him $1200. I saw no reason to tell him the going rate for root canals in CR was around $350 and $1200 was about what was charged in the US. He was happy, which was all that mattered, but it confirmed what I had read about Prisma was true. Or perhaps Prisma’s root canals are somehow superior to the root canals of Dr Castro’s and Obando’s endodontists, but I doubt that is the case. My final observation is that I, personally, would not be impressed by the fact that they “work as a team”. They all do. That’s the only way they can compress all the dental work needed by dental tourists in a short period of time. Dr Castro and Anglada work very closely together in treatment planning, and have an endodontist and periodontist on staff. Dr Obando also has a team he works closely with. You can google other CR dental practices that cater to dental tourists and you’ll see they all work with other dental specialists. Dr Castro, as well as other large practices also have their own dental lab. So, that is not unusual, either. I am not trying to sound so negative about Prisma. I do notice there are many, many positive reviews of them now, which was not the case a number of years ago. I am hopeful that Prisma has improved it’s business practices and perhaps it is now worthy of the good reviews it has been getting more recently."
"Hi btlfan. ok its well tken what you say. You read what I said about not choosing them and being charged more then quoted... yes? By team i meant in-house team. I found out that MANY dental professionals travel here between clinics. There are good ""clinics"" in small towns that cater certainly to locals folk AND tourists. These clinics do not have the $ to have experts full time on staff. Hence they are frequented by specialists and others, they are part time teams. Problem: consistency. As foreigner I look for an in-house team thats accountable; not traveling surgeons and implant experts, good as they are. Here is to your dental health! cheers:)Edited: 12:52 am, November 22, 2019 "
"Interesting Leonore. I was unaware of the Visiting Professionals. With the scope of Your work I, also, would not be comfortable going that route. Nova stands behind their Guarantee which is so important. Also, My Local Dentist is very impressed with the work We had done there. So much so, that He referred a Fishing Capt Friend in CR to Nova after getting the contact info from Me. The smaller Clinics would be unlikely to have the quality of the most recent equipment as well. I have repeatedly been impressed with Dr Obando's desire to continue His education, lead Seminars Internationally and purchase the best and newest equipment. Also, as has been noted, He has certifications above and beyond others in the ""specialty"" clinics. I visit much as You describe. I stay up above Old Centro Escazu in the Mountains above Escazu with a Friend. I enjoy exploring on the local bus. Each trip I have taken a few days up to 2 weeks to explore different areas of CR. The Quality is there, keep looking. It would be a shame to miss out on the huge savings and excellent work available. Perhaps stop in and see Nova for Yourself? Ask for an appt to meet Louis Obando if You don't call and make one first. There is a bus stop on the highway very close or You can go to Multi Plaza via bus and take a 2 minute taxi ride under the highway to Plaza Itzkatzu where it is located. You'll see the Marriott Courtyard Hotel from the highway. Just across the parking lot is Nova's Clinic. Enjoy the beauty of CR in the meantime!"
"Hello again obxpat: Thanks for your encouraging note, incl travel directions to Nova :). I will report back here. Cheers, Leonore"
"Good Evening,Which one of the above mentioned Drs. is practicing @ Nova?"
"Louis Obando is owner, surgeon. Its a 3 person practice: Receptionist, his general dentist / assistant and Dr. Obando.If you are happy with titanium, his work is good and lower in price then another prominent clinic in San Jose. Meeting other foreigner in clinics is eyeopening. One does well in allowing extra time to meet dentists in person, get evaluations, free of charge if possible, and then either stay with them, or keep interviewing. I met today a person from the US who switched after a bad (treatment) experience during her current stay. She postponed departure for a week and has extensive biological dentistry doneno one else but this one clinic I know of, would do well. Who that is I will share later. Dentistry here is for some ""all on 4 or 6..."" practioners a cash cow. Others practioners are sincere.Edited: 10:38 pm, December 06, 2019 "
HelloPlease could you tell me if you have any post dental implant issues over the years.does Dr anglada clinic tends to change the estimate given intially.please share your thoughts as im planning on to visit costarica Thank youJohn
HelloHow is your dental implants after so many years any issues.please share your feed backThank you
"John, I dont have any implants in my mouth. One was attempted a week ago and the post broke, that was at Costa Rica BioDental."
"John B: please read all posts. you will find much information there. I am in CR since 5 weeks, interviwed clnics, began work with one and stopped, because my case is complicated. If you require relatively simpl work, without extractions, many clinics/dentists will do the work. For complex cases, only go to Biological Practitioners who have top notch equipment, who are trained in surgical extractions, ozone.Make sure you see providers who are associated with ONE clinic, and not travvling, independent contractors. Th better the work, th higher the price. Also: You will be told that Zirconium is not as good as Titanium. This is not true. If you want to be treated by someone who has your health in mind, you must study online, read dentists websites, read scientific papers. Do not come here for the sake of saving money alone. Come to to attend to your oral wellness.Edited: 6:56 pm, December 18, 2019 "
"I am 31 years old and need some major work done. Mostly root canals and crowns on my teeth. For some reason, I’m prone to cavities and it’s just devastating. I’ve been saving money for 3 years and finally am ready to go to Costa Rica. I’ve been doing a ton of research and found it overwhelming. Good-ness dental comes up all over the place and I reached out to them. A patient coordinator reached out immediately and has worked with me to create a restoration plan. Now reading all of your threads- I haven’t seen their name pop up once and yet they have a 5 star review and claim to be the best. I’m so confused. Nova comes up a lot and I’m thinking of reaching out to them as well. Just very nervous and not sure which reviews are real and which are paid. Help please!"
"Susie, I am still confused bd got more so the longer I interviewed and met and studied up. Best advise: Learn about BIO Dentistry from all iternatiobal) sources. Root Canals are not longer considered saf by ewpwspectable dentists the world over. You will get only more clarity by learning abouut biological debtistry abd what it is and whois trained in providing it. Dr. dietrich Klinghardt i Seattle is THE guru of holistic medical and dntal wolrd, so is Dr. Ulrich volz in Switzerland. Any Dental surgeon ho is trained by them is top notch. AFTER you are an educated patient you will know how to screen specialists. Learn about titanium vs Zirconium, and ALLpther topics. Nova has happy customers, for example, but this does not mean that the Titanium and root canal procudures they offer are problem free down the road. Our evaluations must go beyond individual doctors, but aroud their relationship with modern holistic dentistry. After 7 weeks in DR, I too have not settled for the one perfect clinic. I warn anyone to consider Costa Rica BioDental for complex procudures.Edited: 9:06 pm, January 11, 2020 "
Susie Be sure to ck out Nova Dentals website. They have a lot of good info. The work you describe is what they do every day. I did extensive research online before going to CR. I was fully prepared to leave if I was not happy with the clinic upon arrival. My work was initially done in 2012. I was very pleased and have not only been back for more work but also referred Family and Friends who also remain happy.
"Thank you guys! I think the amount of reading and research we all do is a shock to most. I ruled out goodness - they weren't the real deal to me. I did contact Meza and the doctor himself called me and explain the process, however, they are are out my budget. I am choosing Dr. Anglada for my work - 26 crowns and 2 implants with a sinus lift. Hope all goes well."
"This will be my first trip down to Costa Rica for dental work. I am in need of the All-in-6 upper jaw titanium implants with a zirconia fixed bridge.I plan on using either Dr Obando or Dr Anglada. The price quoted by these two doctors is just about the same for this procedure, but ... From the info that Dr Anglada sent me, he charges 5 to 7% extra if you pay with credit card .... Considering the cost to be just over $12,000, that 5 or 7% extra adds about another $750 to the price.I don't like traveling with lots of cash in my pocket, so using a credit card for big purchases works the best for me.Question ..... How do you folks pay these dentists down in Costa Rica when you are looking at a very large bill for things such as dental implants?.... Maybe, Dr. Obando don't have the extra fee for using a credit card like Dr. Anglada does ?Thanks,Ron in Florida"
"Dr Obando honors the price quoted. If You Opt to pay ""cash"" there is or at least was a discount. (any must pay the fee if you use cc,In my case, My Husband was in the US when I completed my first trip. He just deposited a ck into Nova's acct at Bank Of America upon completion of work. I emailed him from Nova's office. The second trip He was with me In Costa Rica. We simply had our bank wire transfer the $ into Nova's account. No way would I want to carry that kind of cash there or here in Florida. BTW , not sure where in FL you are but I always fly direct from Ft Lauderdale into SJO. Great rates on Jet Blue for direct flights."
"Thanks for the info ....Well, I just got off the phone with the dental office ... I will just do a wire transfer of funds from my bank to Dr. Anglada's account when the time comes."
"For Ron in Florida - A Money Belt! I was a single older woman traveling alone and had no issues.Edited: 11:25 pm, January 19, 2020 "
"WB did you take thousands of $ in cash for a Dentist.. If so, glad You had no issues. In all my visits I have never take more than a few hundred on me at any time once I arrive. Other funds stay at my lodging in the safe. I would certainly never advise anyone to travel with $12,000 in cash,. Even at the airport here in the US. These days a wire transfer is safe and simple and gets you the same cash discount.Edited: 7:15 am, January 20, 2020 "

I was told that Dr. Anglada will be doing the crowns himself. Booking flight today for the second week in March. So nervous and excited.
obxpat: Where in an airport can one wire money? i took money belt as well but under $ 10K.
"May I speak up here about Titanium? versus Zirconium posts? I got a fine dental education here in CR by visiting conics and receiving thier input, learned about biodentistry, mostly from Dental Cosmetics's connections with Swiss Biodental experts, and Dr, Dietrich Klinghardt (who is a wolrd reknown medical and dental expert). Titanium is not an inert material, whers Zirconium is. Please evrybody do as much bio-dental research before you commit and focus on $ alone. ALSO: check out the topic of cavitations online. DentalCosmetics (in Alajuela, CR near airport) educated me about these. Since I seems to ned them, I am movong forward slower then expected. Extractions and Implants are part of our total dental care. Making sure one is free of necrotic bone infections = sanitizing the jaw is key. Best wishes to all readers!Edited: 12:17 pm, January 20, 2020 "
Susie I will be there the first wk of March. Thus will be my second visit. I should have one more visit after this. Best of luck!
Leonore I have never wired money from an airport? I simply have my Bank in the US wire transfer to Nova's account at Bank Of America.
"I just want to warn others to be very cautious with getting dental work done in Costa Rica. I am still waiting for the Colegio to address the clinic that refused to honor their 5-year warranty when my bridge broke. And another clinic I went to in Costa Rica dropped my case 2 weeks before my scheduled flight out of CR and refused to refund any of my 50% upfront payment. Credit card disputes are iffy - depends greatly on the credit card company and dental clinics here are quite dishonest when addressing disputes. I now plan to pay big bucks to get my work done in the USA, after having lost big bucks and a lot of time trying to get my work done in foreign countries."
Hello Nature Explorer Gal; Thank you for your post. I am very sorry that you had such bad experiences. You could disclose the entities who cheated you. Do you feel you endanger your case if you disclose who the offending clinics are? I screened many clinics before settling on one. We never discussed warranty on work.
"I have been warned of possible legal repercussions of posting negative reviews on TripAdvisor. I have seen that warranty periods vary, with 5 years being typical but have been told 3 - 10 years by the clinics I contacted. But if they don't honor their warranty, it really doesn't matter how long the warranty period is."
"NOVA Dental honored my five year warranty SIX years after my initial work. A crown broke loose. I did tell them I believe it was my fault. I asked about warranty before choosing a clinic. Never have had a problem with Our Credit Card Companies Not Honoring a dispute. We had 3 last year. Even though we travel out of the Country several times a year, the disputes were all in the US. Two for Restaurant Charges that were altered and the other for a hotel parking fee in Miami where we did not even have a vehicle. Sorry You seem to have bad luck. I realize You have been making this same post for quite a while now. Fortunately it seems to be rare as no one else has mentioned similar experience. I would not agree to the 50% up front charge. Nova never asked for any payment up front. Payment is due upon completion of each phase."
"Again, in my case Nova also wanted 50% upfront. Credit card disputes over charges for dental work are more complicated than other credit card disputes. I've won all credit card disputes that did not involve dental work. Others have posted having problems with dental clinics in Costa Rica, tho I only recall one person trying a credit card dispute.Edited: 8:42 am, February 01, 2020 "
"Let me know where you found others with Problems? I must have missed them. So ODD Nova would ask you for FIFTY percent up front. I was never asked as a new Patient nor since for a penny until work for that phase was complete. Also have referred Friends and Family who a were not asked for up front payment of any monies? In all my visits to their Office I have met a number of Patients. Your situation remains unique in them wanting up front pymt. In reality, it seems Clinics would, since they have a considerable investment in time and material. I never thought of it. I have also visited a Dermatologist in Escazu. They also required no $ up front."
"I read about others having problems with CR dental clinics on TA. I find it difficult to believe Nova would want 50% upfront from me if not from others. I only found one dentist in CR who did not want any $ upfront. You say you would not pay 50% upfront, so what would you do if no one would do your work without at least that much upfront? Obxpat, I would greatly appreciate it if you could recognize that my experience has been different from yours and stop challenging my posts.Edited: 2:19 pm, February 01, 2020 "
Challenging...just asked a question! I read TA often and apparently have missed these other posts. I often refer Costa Rica for Dental work. If there are bad clinics I would certainly warn others about those IF I knew which ones they were. I would expect not all of them have the level of Professionalism and Pride in their work I was fortunate enough to find. Not sure why in the world Nova would ask You for 50% up front and not us? What would I do?? Can't answer as I never was faced with such a situation. I suppose I would feel comfortable with a smaller amt. Not fifty percent. I absolutely recognize Your experiences are Very different from Mine. And I believe You had bad experiences at more than one Clinic?
"Hello ALL: REg stalled intern money transfers: Since weeks I am meeting with Dental Cosmetics, a fine bio-dental health clinic. to fine-tune a TP.

Direct money transfer qualifies for 5% cash discount. Now everybody is since a week on standby, I in an air BnB, away from my reg CR visiting place. My visa expires in 4 day.

is anyone familiar with Dr. Kavar? I'm mostly hearing about Nova Dental. Is it possible to get crowns and have the work completed in one trip? Thank you
"Hey! so I am actually flying down Sunday - for two weeks - to see Dr. Anglada, he is doing crowns on all of my teeth (ideally) I can def let you know how my experience with him goes!"
That would be Great Susie. I was just curious because no one has mentioned Dr Kavar. The person here where i live used him 6 years ago and he did really good work.
Dr Anglada is doing crowns? This is something new. Dr Anglada is an implantologist and does implants. Dr Castro does crowns. Are they no longer working together and Dr Anglada is now doing crowns?
"I have heard of Dr Kaver. He has an outstanding reputation for his cosmetic work. You need to know, though, that he has a movie star, ultra white bright aesthetic. If you prefer a more natural look, make sure you let him know. He is known for his veneers"
Please forward information Dental name and website please
"What do you do when travel restrictions, lock down and internal irregularities in a clinic prevent that follow up work be completed? A few of us are caught in this situation. In one case, a patient who had the first phase with multiple implants done, at a hefty cost even in CR, has not heard from the clinic and had no success reaching anyone."
"No knowledge of other Clinics. Nova has maintained it's facebook and webiste presence. Updating as new info is avail. Reaching out via telephone. It is a bad situation for those waiting to complete treatment. I have wondered about many. I am sure the Clinics which cater to ""Foreign"" patients are suffering financially. Many seem to be paying Staff during the closure even when not operational. Expenses continue. I am hopeful the Country will re open soon. None of us can control this and most certainly did not anticipate it. This rises a valid concern for future Patients."
"IMy daughter is waiting to go back to CR for the second phase of her treatment. We were hoping to go in July but that will not happen. I did hear from Dr Castro’s office manager a few weeks ago. They may well be seeing local patients. I keep a pretty close watch on the status of CoVid 19 closures in CR and as of a couple of days ago, they are opening the border at the end of June, but only to CR residents who have been out of the country and want to get back in. I have found no info regarding when or how they will be opening back up to international travelers. It’s my understanding that things are very bad in parts of South America. Another issue likely to delay our trip is our passport. You are required to have at least 6 months before expiration on your passport to enter the country. Our passports expire in Sept, so I sent them in for renewal a few weeks ago. According to the State Dept’s website, they have not been processing passports during the pandemic and will not be doing so until they are fully staffed again. So, considering the massive backlog there will be once the office is fully staffed again, there is no telling when we or anyone else will see their passport. The good news out of CR is that they have only had 10 deaths. From what I have read, CR closed down early and has been credited with being among the few countries in the world successfully containing it. They have a very small number of critical care beds and their health care system would have been quickly overrun if things had gotten out of hand so they were very proactive very early. So, when they do open back up, we should be pretty safe."
"Dr Kavar has an outstanding reputation for crowns and veneers. His office is right next door to Dr Castro’s. One thing you need to know about Dr Kavar: He’s known for his work on models, TV personalities, etc, so he has a bright, white, movie star type aesthetic. I have a friend who got veneers from Dr Kaver but when he was shown what Dr Kaver had in mind, he had to tell him to tone it down a bit. He wantEd natural look, not a movie star look. I have been out of the loop for awhile, but during the years I kept up with the CR dental blogs, I never heard a complaint about Dr Kaver. Just a caution about knowing what effect you want."
"Someone posted a few months ago about having a bad experience with a dentist in CR and being reluctant to state who he/she is for fear of legal action, I am no lawyer, but I would think if you post it using objective, terms, simply describing the service and the dentist’s response, that would not be libelous. “I was given a bridge that broke....After contacting Dr XYZ, he declined to honor his warranty ...”. If you describe in detail what happened, but leave out the negative, inflammatory descriptors such as “ripped me off, shoddy workmanship” “unethical”, “crook”, “quack”, and I wouldn’t even say you’re posting it as a “warning”. You want to “share your experience”. The reader can make up his own mind if he wants to go to a dentist whose work does not meet standards and who doesn’t honor his warranty. Stated objectively, you should be able to say whet clinic you used."
"@221, btlfan, See https:/… ."
"SubjectivelyObjectiv, that is one of the sites I have been watching to try to keep up with CoVid19 in CR. When I checked about a week ago, they had 10 deaths, so the fact that no one else has died in the past week."
"Ok, good, it is only one of the factors though."

"Curious what your outcome was, as this was posted 5 years ago . I’m looking now. Thanks!"
"Hi Chloe: That original poster from 5 years ago is long gone, may have never come back for an answer. There are several threads here on the same topic, but the one with the most traffic and most information by far is 'Dental Tourism in Costa Rica.' Look at the last say 20-30 pages there and you'll find lots of information on which dental practices folks have been using in the last several year or so (obv a lot less conversation since COVID-19). Dental clinics that consistently are discussed, with pretty universal favorable comments are Nova, Anglada and Castro, and Kriebel. I had a very good experience with Kriebel myself. Good luck."
ChicagoAl is right. Not much current travel. I had my work done at Nova initially in 2012. Have been back for general dentistry a few times. Everything was done well and has held up. One small issue was warrantied and taken care of without my even asking!
"DO NOT...i REPEAT... DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR!!!! I had a full mouth of implants that are falling out...breaking off and simply look horrible!!! Now, this is an example of how horrible he and his staff are. After the third time (100% at my expense) I went back to repair some shotty work and the doctor had his dental assistants simply slap some cement in the opening and then said that over time...my tongue will smooth the rough application. Not to mention that the dentures are falling down and on one situation out!! There is nothing you can do about the horrible service in San Jose...if you are an American. They could care less and to be honest they have a good laugh about how stupid Americans are. I never told them I understood Spanish...On the last visit, I learned how they talked about us!!!! DO NOT USE COSTA RICAN dentist...to be forewarned is to be for armed!!!!"
