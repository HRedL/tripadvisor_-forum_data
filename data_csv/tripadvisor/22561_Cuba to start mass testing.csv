Not sure if mentioned already.https:/…And mentioned in an article in the UK guardian.https:/…cuba-coronavirus-covid19-mass-testing
That is good news. I would not have a problem with an hour or so delay at the airport while all incoming passengers were tested. Of course they would have to do it fast enough so they could put you on the returning flight if you failed.
"Try either of these links, same info:cubadebate.cu/noticias/…anexo-1365747escambray.cu/2020/…They say real time PCR tests on a representative sample of apparently healthy people from all municipalities in all provinces."
"So far, the tests are not meant for travellers or airports. They are meant for the general population. They are testing people who are not considered ""at risks"" ie they have not been in contact with infected people."
"Gengen: I was saying that IF the Cuban government decided to test all incoming passengers as a requirement for admission that I would think that was a good idea.Personally, I will voluntarily have myself tested just before departure from the US solely to insure there is no chance of my bring CV to my family."
"Sorry for misunderstanding Bob. I did not see any relation between your comment and the testing that is being done in Cuba right now, so I thought that maybe there was some information circulating about testing incoming passengers.The problem with testing people (before departure or on arrival) is that it does not guaranty that you don't carry the virus. The tests are usually accurate at least 4-5 days after being infected. So if you were infected only a few days or a few hours prior to boarding the plane, you will test negative while being positive. Same with testing upon arrival. The only secure way to make sure that incoming passengers do not infect the population is the have a mandatory quarantine like they have right now. But that is not realist to think Cuba could open for tourism but send everyone to quarantine. So it will all be about risk management and limiting contagion as much as possible. But until a vaccine is found, the chances that travellers will infect people in the country they visit is extremely high."
"Gengen: thanks for the tutorial about Coronavirus. Actually, I know a bit. We get about 12-14 hours a day news about the CV / political situation on several news networks of which I watch too much of. Additionally, my son is Chief of Staff at the largest hospital (proudly also rated #1) here in Florida so he can fill in any knowledge gaps."
"I really don't understand your tone nor the way you took my answer. I was giving my opinion as to why I think that testing before leaving or after landing is not useful and explaining my POV. Lately, you have been taking most things I say personally lately and always as a sort of personal attack. I will not engage. Good night."
Gengen: two of your three paragraphs were telling me about Coronavirus.
"Bob - but she didn’t know that you knew. And others reading the thread probably didn’t know.By the way, is there anywhere that I can go to see the numbers of cases in a specific city in Florida ? (Hialeah, Homestead). There was one website of one newspaper that showed that but that has not been updated in a week."
"Bob, in my opinion... I didn't see any ""personal attack"" in your comments, nor any problem with your tone. You're a man... that's your only crime.TerryEdited: 9:33 am, May 15, 2020 "
"beardo: the state of Florida is becoming less transparent with CV statistics. The belief is that new Republican governor DeSantis is working hard to gather favor with Trump and pushing his reopen the economy agenda. Most of our info comes from independent news sources who gather and sort out data.One good source is https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/ then click on ""dashboard"" for more detailed info. It is broken down by county but not by city. You can get summaries by zip code.You do have to dig around that website."
we're seeing the dumbing down of stats for political purposes every where.hard to know the truth about anything these days.carol e.
"Carol, I only go out of the house to get more food, more beer and rum, and collect the mail. I don't even listen to the news in Canada anymore. I'm content to just stay at home and stay safe. That's enough for me. The rest is non-essential and simply distracting from the my efforts and goal of staying healthy for better times to come.Terry"
"beardo: In #12, I referenced the official State of Florida website or ""dashboard"" of daily CV stats. Two days ago the person responsible for that info was fired. Her representation is that she refused to follow orders from state government to manually change some of the stats in a manner that would have been more supportive of loosening restrictions and reopening the economy. The state government position is that she was not qualified enough for the job to understand how those manual changes were necessary so FL stats could be compared to other states."
"Certainly a big part of the problem with the statistics we are seeing is that the methodology is different all over the world, and in some cases it has been changed mid-stream. Add politics into the mix and it's hard to know what to believe. I've been paying more attention to the per capita numbers, when you can find them. A lot of the maps I'm seeing are pretty much just population density maps.Edited: 6:37 pm, May 21, 2020 "
Bob - interesting.
"So much for draining the swamp. Oh but yes! That was the swamp in Washington... that's right. God help everyone in the US now living in their upside down world there.TerryEdited: 10:51 am, May 23, 2020 "
