"I am trying to find out what sort of card is best , i have been reading that a lot of places when open back up will not take cash and only card payments .I don't really want a pre paid card , looking for one i can transfer money to and exchanges it into euros, That way i don't have money left on a card when i get back."
Cash is King otherwise try Halifax clarity card
"Cash is king.....unfortunately not anymore !Guests will be encòuraged to pay by card and not by cash !I have alwzys used cash in cyprus but it looks like if ive got it then they may not take it as payment, even shops in the U.k. are doing this now."
Cash will always be king in the bars are Protaras
"If credit cards aren’t your thing, you could Look at Transferwise or Starling Bank Accounts as a viable option. Easy to set up, transfer money between your regular bank. Near bank exchange rate. Euro accounts. Comes with MasterCard Debit Card"
"I am not worried about the bars in Protaras , I am more worried if the local shops or restaurants will take cash payments, If the Cyprus goverment do put the rule in that they can no longer take cash as payment and only cards to be used , then cash will no longer mean a thing."
"Card only payments will never happen as most, if not all, restaurants don’t declare every transaction."
"The below link pretty much describes current situationCoronavirus: Card overthrows cash as kinghttps:/… Robert A, card or cash, always ask for a VAT receipt."
Why would I ask for a VAT receipt I’m on holiday so don’t carry if they put it through the books or not.Only ever ask for receipts when travelling with work
"Is it fair to accuse ""most, if not all"" restaurant owners of not putting payments through the books, if you don't care to ask for the receipt?"
Sinnayis I’m not accusing anyone but it does happen all around the world as it helps owners pay any casual staff in cash rather than have the hassle of putting them through the books
"Let's stay with the receipts all around the world, for card or cash payments, that you don't bother to ask from the restaurant owners while on holidays; if indeed they've issued one equal to the amount paid, there is no unregistered income for owners to pay ""any casual staff"", is it?Edited: 9:13 am, June 03, 2020 "
"Sinnayis what planet do you come from, who mentioned receipts apart from you.Cash in hand payments for casual staff has been happening for years and will continue to happen for years to come.There are millions of people around the world who don’t like using plastic and prefer cash so until the world becomes cash free, this won’t happen in my lifetime, then most places will gladly accept cash payments.If there put them all through the books, a lot don’t, then that is up to them not you"
"I come from a planet, where, in the number of countries I've visited so far, people in goodwill trade fairly; who issue receipts when they are asked for the bill; and when customers have doubts, the business owners answer their questions..Clearly cash or card I couldn't care less. The OP was worried about possibilities of card only transactions may happen in Cyprus, so I linked a relevant report, I try not to make up stories from my couch and definitely have not provided pro COVID-19 dated info."
"rachdodo, as to the U.K. also ENCOURAGING you to pay by card, Yes this mostly correct, But in my part of the U.K. you can stand in the queue for Sainsburys and the shop assisant comes along the queue and says Card payments only ! ! And people leave the queue because of this.The point was that reading on different sites that the Cyprus Goverment COULD put this in force is what made me ask.I hope i can take my cash and spend it in Protaras ."
Nowadays people go for contactless cards for ease of transaction and avoiding handling coins or paper notes others have touched before. It is up to you really as both are accepted everywhere
