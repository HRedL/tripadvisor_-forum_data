"Hi Folks, 60 sleeps to go for our 7th visit since 1986.Tried other places but always return to Kenya.Totally agree with drakesdrum and smudger888.Has anyone tried to analysis why so many people contract Kenyaitis.Perhaps brochures should carry some sort of health warning! "
"WELCOME!!Another member of the ""Itis"" club Please do not even try and understand ""WHY"" .. but for me it is first and foremost the children followed by its people [ those fabulous smiles ]and then we come to the wonderful simply breathtaking Flora [those magnificent baobab trees ] and Fauna Wonderful."
"Hi Drakesdrum,Couldn't agree more.We've often wondered how the people manage to stay so happy when you see how tough life is for them. "
"If someone had told me, 5 odd years ago that I would be suffering from ""itis"" I wouldn't have believed them, but here I am, regular trips, kids, flora, fauna, smiles, laid back and carefree attitude.Wonderful **Sigh***Edna - does this mean me & hubby are now in the ""itis"" club!! Always wanted to rub shoulders with the exclusives....lol"
"Oh! without a doubt ""your in"" and Welcome xx  A warning for future members -- once in -your in -- there is NO KNOWN CURE ...."
"""there is NO KNOWN CURE ....""...apart, of course, from coming to live here :-)"
"Its just a wonderfull place. So happy people everywhere. Its taken me 4 years to convince my wife she has itis and yipee Turtle bay in june here we come.No matter where i have been its always, well in Kenya it would be better!!Its one itis i don't ever want to go away."
"It's like Marmite you either love Kenya or hate it, because believe it or not there are people who have been and not enjoyed the place. There is something about Kenya/Africa that makes we want to return despite the corruption, bad government etc. An old Kenya hand told me that once you go itâ€™s in your blood. How true!"
"Yes Folks we're all infected.We,ve tried going cold turkey and spending holidays in other places and wondering what the weather's like in Kenya.But eventually you crack and you're back in the habit.Perhaps these rehab clinics will start trying to offer us counciling.But they won,t cure us. "
"There is NO COUNCILING in the ""Itis"" club...I am extremely pleased to say all the members who have joined a long time ago has ever been ""cured"" .. Stil have a few places left for this highly sought after club ...dont be shy ..there are no weighing machines . . no fees ..you dont have speak your name.... but you do have to LOVE KENYA 100%"
"I guess as we're about to venture to Kenya on our 8th visit and have already booked our 9th for next year then surely we must also admit to having this ""itis"" infection and the only treatment seems to be regular visits........To Kenya of course!! "
"Hi Drakesdrum,Do you think that some lab somewhere is working on a vaccine.Because there may be an epidemic in the future if more people go to Kenya.Visitors may have to take malaria and itis prevention."
"Sssssssh I am in top secret talks with MDF... no.... MFi.. no the other one !""!!!!Working on it right now Hoenstly though do you want a cure?The only one desperate for Me and hubby to find a cure is the Bank Manager !!!!"
"No known cure known to man or woman ! best disease I ever caught.I remember well our 2nd visit in 1997, as the wheels of the plane touched down in Mombasa, Mrs smudger turned to me and said ""it really feels like I,m home""I don't know why but it does feel like home when we get there5 more weeks and we will be there !!!!!!!!"
Its just such a wonderful country with fantastic people. Last year was the first time I had not visited Kenya since 1995 due to changing jobs and I cant wait till the end of the year when I will be returning. How we have missed our annual Kenyan fix. Only 63 days to go.
So if i loved The Gambia will i love kenya as going first time in june next year.
"Signing in as another affected by this infectious disease - best illness I've ever had ! We returned to the UK on the 10th of this month and I can honestly say I was missing Kenya the moment I stepped on UK soil. We went 2 years ago and thought this is place is wonderful, back this year and it has just confirmed to me that I have found my heaven, no place (especially the Mara) could ever be as good for a holiday. We will return again, again, again . . . . . . ."
"I also have Kenyaitis. I believe I contracted it in 2001, but there's no cure, other than to return year after year... and occasionally live there. It relieves the symptoms greatly. The only absolute cure is to stay forever!"
we have been to the Gambia ONCE ! I don't have enough fingers to count our Kenyan trips
I haven't even been there yet and I've got it!11 sleeps and counting
"Lordsmudge, I really hope you enjoy Kenya as much as we do, by actually visiting you do realise that your condition will worsen ! you have been warned, ENJOY :-)"
"We've only been for our 1st time this year and feel we have got Kenyaitis. Infact we have booked again for next year. Unfortunately it might be our last for a few years cos next year is last son will be classed as a child and cos I work in a school we are stuck with school hols so will prob cost too much.Its ok for him he's started at secondary school this year and they do a trip to Kenya in year 9 and he's already said he wants to go.In one of the classes I work with we have an 8 year old Kenyan boy who is one of the most polite,good humoured and intelligent little boys I have ever worked with. The trouble is every time I'm in his class I keep thinking of Kenya."
"Hi Bruce596,With 63 sleeps to go sounds like we'll be there about the same time,we have 60."
"Joking aside, there is a theory here that, because Kenya is home to the cradle of mankind (Koobi Fora), anyone who visits here is merely ""returning home"", just a couple of million years late..."
"Hi!I've got Kenyaitis aswell, I guess I inherited from my mother ;o). I personally got ""hooked"" in 1977 and she got infected in 1968 so I can tell you, there is no cure for this amazing -itis....;o))Five weeks to go :o) and we are finally in Kenya again. Cheers,Mswisi"
"I'dlike to join the club as well!!We booked our flights on Tuesday with KA for our January stay at the Serena Beach. Our first visit was in Jan '92 and we have gone very year since apart from one when we went to Vietnam and Phuket. Vietnam was fabulous but Phuket, you could have been anywhere in the world. The hotel and all of its facilities were fantastic but no atmosphere whatsoever.I'm off to Florida in a months time and will be stocking up at Wal Mart for toys, childrens medicines etc (much cheaper than here). One of the best things I have ever taken to Kenya were 99cent magic slates from Wal Mart which the children in Mtwapa village thought were great.Hope Kenya is busier than this January, it was heart breaking seeing so many staff at the hotel go on long leave and wondering if we would ever see them again. Roll on January 9 2009!!"
"We're off to Kenya on Monday for the first time! After reading all the posts on this forum I hope we catch ""Kenyaitis"" as it sounds wonderful.Will write a post when we get back!Denchris"
"Hi Shanzususan,What a wonderfull idea,beats giving the kids ball-point pens.I can see Walmart will have extra long queues at the checkouts.Nice try with Vietnan to cure the Kenyaitis but as has been said "" There ain't no cure for the Kenya blues"".Have a good return.Mike. "
So if i loved Gambia will it mean that i love Kenya More ????
"In my experience that would be a yes, been to the Gambia and I liked it a lot, however Kenya steals the show by a long way ! enjoy "
Thanks Smudger i am def looking forward to going as been to Gambia twice and loved it both times. My only concern is the smoking embargo on the beach guess may have to have short strolls then back to hotel for a smoke.Julie
"My 10 year old son has a very bad case of Kenyaitis.He will only go to Turtle Bay, all his mates are off to Florida and alike, he won't even entertain the idea!!We only have 10 sleep until our flight from Manchester, I doubt that he will manage more than 5!! I am not sleeping well, cases are nearly packed, then I will start on cleaning fridge and cupboards.If you find a cure I don't want it... nothing will stop this family returing again and again."
"Fortunately the strain caught at TBBC is one of the more virulent strains, you can catch a a very similar strain at the voyager in mombasa, we,ve had the TBBC strain for 8 years now"
"Have no fear,Your son will be cured after his first dip in the swimming pool."
"Same here, Kenyaitis - the place just gets 'under your skin'. It is the only holiday destination that I go to and I don't want to return home! Have tried a couple of other longhaul detinations this year and last, but have booked to return to Kenya in January - I need a Kenyan fix!"
"Resurrected this old post as I cant voice an opinion yet but I think lots of places all round the world have their ""resort addicts"" and of course they are the ones loyal to that forum. people who holiday in a place once or twice and move on or were not happy with a place temd to move on and of course are not around to voice their opinions.I have been lucky enough to travel to a lot of places and to date there was only one that really did let me down and that was sri lanka, I hated the hotel, thought the people insincere and was just very disapointed BUT many people love it.Some travel agents are to blame with descriptions .. for example Pinewood is sold as a Deluxe Boutique resort above 4 stars in many brochures and no mention is made of differing standards to other countries ""deluxe"" definitions. I have been to several countries with difficult political regimes and a lot of poverty but hotel standards truly are luxury and actually a lot cheaper than Kenya with people that have fallen over backwards to help you in and out of the hotels without a tip being the ulterior motive so I can see how some people who are not in the addiction family could be disapointed.This is the first country I have ever felt the need to research as extensively in 35 years of long haul travelling ... has the forum research given me the right views I will wait and see and yes, I do hope I love the place as much as many."
"HA HA ! you have already caught Kenyaitis and you've not been yet :-)You will not regret visiting Kenya and I bet you will return , lets say I donate some money to the lioness cubs if you do return :-)"
""" You will not regret visiting Kenya and I bet you will return , lets say I donate some money to the lioness cubs if you do return :-)""Smudger ..... so you will give money to the cubs if I DO choose to go back. So you think I wont then lol :)????"
I think I have it already and I have not been yet - 1 more sleep Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!Excited me - NO!!!!!!!!!!! How can you tell!!!
"Now Im worrying as havnt got tickets yet. Kuoni sent to Agents on Tursday, Agents (in Manchester) not got them yet and have to send on to us in Kent .... you would think with these postal issues they would have sorted in better time ...gggrrrhhh!!!"
"isnt this nice we can talk about an ""Addiction"" openly -honestly and without embarrasment lol !!!I always said If I could bottle this ""Itis"", every village would have water -schools and Clinics !!!I have been very fortunate to have travelled extensively around the world and when we took another holiday we come back missing Kenya and find a cheap flight for our FIX !!!!!Happy to say there`s plenty of room for Newies to join - no yearly subscriptions -no one needed to make coffee, its a total chill out club ........come on in ...."
Well i agree with every one me and hubby caught kenyaitus as soon as i landed foot on the ground i felt i was back home as i felt as ease and peaceful and cant wait to go back.
Problem with Kenyaitis is there is no cure known to man and the only 'medication' available is not cheap.It consistas of going to Kenya 2 or 3 times a year.My doctor won't give me a 'presription' for flights.He says it it is not as bad as some ailments - little does he know. 
"Blueamber I'm confident you will return ! and when you do, I can go and visit the cubs again :-)Will be visiting them again soon, can't wait to see them all again.""i felt i was back home "" I like that ! just how Jill and I feel when the plane touches down in mombasa.Kenya really gets under your skin in a big way, not been anywhere else since 1996, I know the world is a big place but we have found somewhere we both love and have such great friends there, true friends.Oh and the fishings very good :-)"
"can I join the 'itis' club please? Looking forward to seeing Mr and Mrs Drakesdrum tomorrow evening, will be getting the Tuskers in, you will need a few of them down you if we are to subject you to all our Kenya pics!!!!"
So this is what I'm suffering from........I need to go home.........to Kenya
ssssssssssh now every Itis -er will be knocking on your door -----sorry chaps I am in for a treat - with the tusker cold and honey sweet - Jambo Jambo Here I come -knocking on the door of Number ??????
"I developed this disease in 2006 and instead of getting better it'w getting worse ! We have been 3 times in 4 years, got back last Sunday from latest visit and one one of the first things I did when I got back was to find out a price for next year . . . . . HELP !!!!!! :o)"
"What happened to Virginia and Mike? I seem to remember they appeared and were prolific posters straight away, just realised I have seen anything from them for a long time.Are you still here?"
