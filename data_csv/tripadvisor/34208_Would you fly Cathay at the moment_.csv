"Hi all,Family has to make quick work trip to Frankfurt late March. Cathay have a good fare in PE (via HKG, $3300). Would you be any warier of Cathay than any other airline (other than mainland Chinese ones) currently?Over on the Japan forum ( would you believe I cancelled QFFs through HKG to London a month ago and rerouted through Tokyo thinking it would be safer, so am watching a thread there about what's going on re Covid), I read that HKG hasn't had a new case since Feb 18, so am thinking Cathay is probably as safe a bet as any. Q is out of the question $ wise.Any advice, thoughts, suggestions very welcome and appreciated."
"Hi,I wouldn't fly Cathay Pacific at any time.https:/…cathay-pacificCheers,"
"I think it’s down to health/safety vs cost/comfort.For PE on this route, you really don’t have much choice if QF is outside your price range, and SIN is not an option. It’s actually quite remarkable that CX even has this route still operating considering they’ve ceased 90% of their services.The only alternative I could suggest - and it’s not a favourable comparison - would be economy with QR, one of the better product in that market"
"Thanks for your replies.KVE do you mean that Cathay is currently flying only 10% of its routes? Is this because 90% of its routes are to/fro mainland China or because demand on non Chinese routes has evaporated? By your comment re trade off between health safety etc, I assume you mean there is a trade off to be made flying Cathay.I've just priced Qatar and Qantas in Economy. QR is fastest and cheapest. Singapore Airlines is routing through Canberra, with quite a long layover in Singapore. I'm thinking Qatar looks good, it's fast (1 stop) and cheap. Is its Economy better than Qantas? When you say 'not a favourable comparison', I take it you mean compared to PE? I really appreciate your help, thank you very much."
"I'd have no hesitation flying Cathay at the moment. I'd think twice about a stopover in Hong Kong beyond the airport, but the actual flight itself shouldn't be an issue.How about Thai via Bangkok? Have you priced them? Or Malaysian (not knowing if they fly to Frankfurt)."
Yes I think economy on Qatar is better than Qantas and Doha airport is easier to navigate than Dubai IMO.But I would have no issue flying Cathay. We just did 3months ago .
"Hi Sasanqua,Yes that’s what I had heard, that CX is currently only flying 10% of its entire route network.I don’t believe the entire 90% is through mainland China, as from an article I read not too long ago, they ceased flights to London (LGW), Rome, Newark, and numerous other cities that aren’t in China.I stated ‘unfavourable comparison’ purely for the fact that QR does not have a PE product, so the comparison would not have been like for like.But I did suggest QR for all the reasons which you have mentioned; transit via a non Asian city, shortest overall travel time, outstanding product, loyalty program aligned with QF, and cheaper. I had heard gossips of QR’s new economy product, but I suspect they won’t all be fitted by the time you travel."
"Thank you very much all and particularly KVE.Just thinking about all this, do you get checked (ie temperature taken etc) as you are boarding a flight or only as you are disembarking?"
"We are booked on Cathay flights in early April, booked in April 2019 and have watched as Cathay has had issues after the riots in HK and then with the Covid-19. They have been cutting flights since Sept last year due to reduced demand. Cathay says it has reduced its mainland China services by 90% and other services by 40%. https:/…For us flying from Brisbane, I have noticed lots of the flights now go from BNE to SYD then to HK, where the flight we have booked is direct from BNE to HK, not that would be an issue for you. Our dates are just outside the March 28 date they currently give for the cutbacks , which will be interesting to see how that pans out.I wouldn't be doing a new booking with them. I have flown with them before quite happily and would recommend them usually, but not just now. I am looking at other options for our flights, just in case!"
"I recommend checking out the WHO situation reports as they have facts and figures rather than media hype. Hong Kong have only had 81 cases of CoronaVirus, which is less than Singapore. Australia has had 22. https:/…That being said, i always get good feedback about the Qatar economy product."
"I am flying on Cathay in two days. I am not worried one bit.Schedule changes are announced well in advance. Normally, if they are suspending routes, you should have enough notice to check for reroutes or refunds. In some unfortunate cases, such as the sudden spike of infections in South Korea, the decision to suspend could be immediate. That said, other airlines could suspend those destinations as well for the same reason.As to their current route, per their webpage and my occasional browsing of the HK Airport website, they have indeed suspended 90% of mainland Chinese flights but *just* 40% of the rest of their network. They will make every effort to keep the rest of their schedule just to pay some overhead. See their official statement:https:/…Regarding HKG airport itself, if you exercise good hygiene ( don't touch your face, eat or drink before washing your hands), you should be fine. Passenger traffic is way down so it won't be crowded.I have flown with Cathay for decades. I am not a huge fan by any means. Just like many other airlines, they have kept cutting back and cutting back just to stay competitive. On the other hand, being based in HK, I felt I should offer some of what I know regarding the current situation."
"In terms of health, I wouldn't be concerned about flying Cathay at all. But I would be concerned about reliability. Cathay's an OK airline, but between the riots and Covid 19, traffic to and from HK has taken a massive hit, and Cathay has been cancelling individual flights and whole routes. Sammy FD @11 is right about Cathay's statements, but I'd still be worried about getting stuck somewhere for a few days if my flight were suddenly cancelled. It depends how valuable your time is, and whether you're willing to take the gamble for the comfort. I'd just fly economy on another airline."
"In reply to #1, so I look at the incidents:For 2020, one incident on a flight with no passengers. Second incident on a freighter.For 2019, 9 incidents including turbulence and bird strike.And they are not on the top 20 airlines incidents list. So I am not so sure what's your issue with Cathay?"

"From what you write you seem more concerned about COVID-19 than a specific airline issue.Reality is that the incubation time can be longer than 20 days (median 5-6 days). So what you see today, is showing the spreading of a few days back.Reality is also that the window for containment is closing (or already has closed). The Sars-CoV-2 virus is spreading around the world.Serious complications are mostly in the age group above 50 and increasing with increasing age of the patient.However, Sars-CoV-2 is a flu virus with COVID-19 having around the double mortality of an average flu. But to put things into perspective, the ""normal"" flu causes every year around 500,000 - 600,000 death.I do not want to downplay COVID-19 with above. It is important nevertheless not to panic.I would look at travel advisories from your Government. But I also would not overthink certain things.AIRLINE:As with every flight, statistics will not help you with a single flight. That also applies to your worries. You are concerned about a single flight and therefore looking at a large sample size does not really help.SUMMARYWould I avoid some geographies? I would follow the travel advisories.Would I avoid a specific airline? No. Especially as you only spend very little time in an aircraft compared to other crowded places, when you travel."
A friend of mine just flew MAN-HKG-DPS with Cathay His original flight was cancelled but he was re-booked within hours. Flight itself had only 50 or so pax so was very relaxed. In the airport in HK it was very quiet with more staff than passengers in the Lounge.I would still fly Cathay
"#1 OZRCFLYER Of course you looked at the pages of statistics for all the other airlines on that link didn't you?!!!Edited: 7:39 am, February 26, 2020 "
"""Of course you looked at the pages of statistics for all the other airlines on that link didn't you?!!!""It is not only that but the fact that Cathay had never a deadly accident and neither a hull loss. And there are not many airlines around with that track record."
"Yes, that is certainly an enviable safety record. And even the best airlines can have incidents that are due to sheer bad luck, or totally unpredictable circumstances."
Yes I would.
