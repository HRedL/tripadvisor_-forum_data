Hello Everyone! I will be visiting Miami ( South Beach) on April 24-28 for a bachelorette trip. I was wondering if anyone could recommend any free daytime events. Any suggestions would be helpful! Thank you. Shaina
Like free coronavirus screenings?
I am not really going out on a limb by suggesting that there will be no events.
"Shaina>Events are scheduled about a week in advance so you'll have to wait to see what is happening during your visit. In mid-April, check sites like EVENTBRITE and also GOOGLE ""events South Beach April 24-28"" to see what is offered. AG"
You do realize the beaches are closed right?
"While it’s difficult to project a month out in the current fast changing situation (and op is well advised to keep plans flexible), the beaches are not all closed. Currently, in Miami Beach, the beach is closed between 5 and 15 Streets only, until March 19. Most restaurants are closed after 10 pm.In mainland Miami restaurant dining rooms will be closed at all times from Wednesday onwards, with carry out and delivery staying open. This is as of now, Monday night. Things may change anytime."
"To update the above a bit:Miami Beach joined mainland Miami in closing all restaurants and bars starting tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. Take-out and Delivery can stay open.No change in beach closings (section from 5 to 15 Streets still closed, the rest open)."
"Another update:As of today, March 19, 2020, all beaches and “non essential” stores are closed in the Miami area.Restaurants operating for take out/delivery only. Hotels are open but some closed and others may close due to lack of business.It may be similar in other parts of Florida."
