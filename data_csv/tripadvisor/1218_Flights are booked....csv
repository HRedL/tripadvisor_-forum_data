"...for September! Hopefully things will be back to ""normal"" by then!Hello! I'm getting a little overwhelmed with where to stay and would appreciate some input on where might be the ideal spot. My wife and I will be staying from September 3rd to the 12th (9 nights) and would like to keep the nightly rate to no more than $275 a night after all the taxes and fees are added in. Would love to be able to stay on 2 parts of the island as I'd like to hike all sides without spending so much time in the car but I realize that would bring costs up with the extra cleaning fee. We are both right around 50 years old, I'm active and she'd be perfectly happy with reading on the beach or lanai the whole vacation. We aren't into the nightlife scene or fancy restaurants. Here's my wish list:1+ bedroom with a kitchen.North shore for at least 6 days (maybe a 2 night stay in a hotel on the east or south side and then move north?)Ocean viewA nearby beach within walking distance.Snorkeling beach would be a bonus.Privacy...meaning, I don't want to be sitting on the lanai and be able to see our next door neighbors on theirs. Paths or trails nearby would be a bonus as I'm a runner. I think that's pretty much it! I have been looking through hundreds of listings on airbnb, vrbo and some of the local websites as well as here to gain knowledge of where we might want to be...I just need some clarity. Thank you so much!!"
"Boy, you're being pretty optimistic by risking airfare for Sept. The experts are saying we'll be dealing with this virus for 12 to 18 months. It doesn't matter now because you booked the air already, but you should hold off on any place that won't be cancellable and get your deposit back 100%, like a hotel."
It is really strange to me that people are still obsessed with making travel plans. This is nuts!
"""Flights are booked......for September! Hopefully things will be back to ""normal"" by then!""I don't think they will be.Hopefully, you booked with one of the airlines allowing one corona cancellation or change.I sure wouldn't book anything else. (Unless it's a fully cancellable hotel and you note the deadline carefully.)"
"Oh boy, Just know there is NO guarantee things will be back to normal. For September though I'd consider booking HOWEVER...... be prepared to cancel if need be. So play it smart. Don't book airfare unless you're okay with the airlines only giving you a credit for future use. If you're okay with that then proceed on to Step 2 - your lodging. Don't book lodging yet. You have lots of time to play this out and see what the situation is. Use this time to research your options. Trust me, there will be plenty of options for lodging especially since September is a slow period. DO NOT BOOK LODGING until it's a go for sure. And even then, don't book anything that has a stiff cancellation policy. There are plenty of condos on the north shore that would fit the bill. There's just no need to book now. I know half of the fun is the planning but I wouldn't get too carried away with it just yet. In the end, I have to believe September would be okay but I've been wrong before about situations like this.Edited: 6:46 pm, March 20, 2020 "
Thank you all for your concerns. I booked with Southwest for this very reason. My plan was to also talk to the property owners about their cancellation policies in the event that things hadn't gotten better by then.
I'm also looking at changing our flight to September with Delta.
"If this is still going on in September, in a way so severe that it precludes healthy people from rationally traveling domestically, I suspect that a very substantial part of the US economy will be destroyed and life as we knew it will no longer exist. I would be VERY surprised if that is the case, and I personally would be willing to risk money on a September trip. (I am still hoping to go in late May).  But if someone wants absolute certainty, that is not available."
I'd recommend you talk with the on island agencies which have been so generous with guests in their cancellation policies - The Parrish Collection and Kauai Island Vacations have both been mentioned on this board.
"Working with the Poipu Beach Resort Association I regularly reach out to resorts and rental agents on the south shore. The cancellation policy we've heard about here with Parrish and a few other instances are not unusual. I haven't had a one tell me that they're not reimbursing 100%. Let's give a shout out to all rental agents, owners and resorts who are doing the same.Edited: 11:15 am, March 21, 2020 "
"""Boy, you're being pretty optimistic by risking airfare for Sept. The experts are saying we'll be dealing with this virus for 12 to 18 months""I certainly don't disagree with the comment but the other issue many haven't thought of is how many condo owners will be selling or losing their vacation homes due to foreclosure because of this. I'm guessing the average vacation homeowner plays a tight balancing act in making monthly mortgage, property tax and HOA payments with what money is coming in from the rental agency.Edited: 12:37 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Clint raises a very good point....and one that I don't think has been mentioned much. I wouldn't schedule a September trip, to be honest. I think we have a very long and hot summer ahead , with thousands of cases of COVID-19. September looked ""safe"" before......not so much now."
"""If this is still going on in September, in a way so severe that it precludes healthy people from rationally traveling domestically, I suspect that a very substantial part of the US economy will be destroyed and life as we knew it will no longer exist.""I hope that statement doesn't become prophetic, onekbear. But with the economic impacts of mandated slow/shutdowns already being felt, and the prospect of having to deal with coronavirus for 12 - 18 months, I don't yet see any reasons why it won't."
"I suggest people read the New York Times. They have a free COVID-19 update section. I can't link it since I have an account (sorry not giving people access, lol).The recession ahead is going to break records for sure.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Akamai Nick: I don't know what ""records""you are talking about, but if you are saying this will be worse than the Great Depression, I see no evidence that is likely.Edited: 4:52 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"I go by ""SW"", always have :-).I wasn't claiming to know the future, LOL. And yes-most of the econ experts don't think the coming recession will surpass the Great Depression.......but most think it will be worse than the last recession and others. Some of the models and predictions are very interesting.I do think this one will be worse for Hawaii than the last or after 09-11. Way worse.Edited: 6:13 pm, March 21, 2020 "
It is a slap in the face to the residents of Hawaii to be talking about scheduling flights there for vacations.How insensitive to the problems of the people who live on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If you are planning a vacation....You Are The Problem and you are giving tourists a really bad name. Don't forget that ALOHA also means GOODBYE..
"I agree with SW and Bear.This will kill the mainland financials and REALY kill the Hawaii tourism industry since tourism/traveling is done with the ""spare"" $$ people have.Since last week, yes one week, the unemployment claims have gone up 2.5 MILLION people in the US (over 70,000 in Connecticut alone). We are in ""Lockdown"" no one goes ANYWHERE.These aren't your minimum wage workers either, they are pilots, stewardesses, auto store workers and managers, auto sales people, mechanics, home builders, plumbers, HVAC techs, landscapers, etc, etc.I tried to schedule an air tour for our November trip (booked last year), that air tour company is now Going Out of Business for good (too much overhead with $0 coming in).I contacted our favorite little food place in Koloa (wanted to get several food platters for our November birthday party for my mom) he said he's going week to week but hasn't made $$ in the last 2 so he may be closing his doors for good.My point is the whole US AND Hawaii will never be the same.Kauai will never recover financially because this isn't just a housing bubble in the US or a hurricane, this a whole world financial crises. No One will travel.As was pointed out, wait until all the foreclosures start happening.Be careful on what you wish for (no tourists), you may get it in spades.Edited: 11:57 am, March 22, 2020 "

"The quarantine order is in place until further notice.........No one in Hawaii can stop flights. Only the Feds can do that. And no--flights into HNL were already restricted, just like the rest of the US.As of yesterday, the case total was 48. By today, I am betting at least another 10. We are just starting to see the growth :-(."
"would be interesting to see a venn diagram and the overlap of ppl that, 2 weeks ago were coming "" no matter what, b/c dangit, I paid my $"" and the ppl who are hoping to rebook so soon.This may have been answered already, (trying to keep up w/ threads) but have other islands proposed curfews like Kauai? And do residents think that will help? or unenforceable? I see comments about clearing beaches, etc, but does HI have the manpower do do it? Who is patrolling all of this?"
"The argument that JohnandJean681985 make is not a popular one, but it is worthy of serious consideration. It may be that the ultimate solution to this situation is herd immunity -- that, whatever we do, it is just going to spread. So the question becomes how much of the Hawaii and world economy do we want to see destroyed in the process."
