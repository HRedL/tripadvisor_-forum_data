"Looks like Aruba has a local transmission outbreak on its hands. 56 cases according to DVG, 49 are local transmission.Damn. Really thought Aruba had it under control."
Dam I was planing on going next week. Where did you hear this?
Directly from the Aruba Health Department DVG - https://www.facebook.com/desparuba/

See daily update on visit Aruba website. Bad newshttps:/…
wow so sad...I was just about to book everything and head there for a few weeks. Guess now I'll wait and see.
"Not saying that those two people were the ones that caused this but they both need to be fined the maximum amount each as a warning to others that Aruba is not screwing around. Those two people had NO regard for the health and safety of Aruba or the other people around them. It's not surprising though, considering the way a lot of the USA sees this pandemic in their own country. Yes it's seems like I'm bashing the USA but let's call it the way it is. Anyone watching the news can see what it's like in the USA and it is not fake news. This is real and people need to start treating it like it is, a fact of our current life, because it is. Anyone that says it's BS really needs to look at what is going on and went on in NY, those people suffered and are suffering and that is real, you can not see it any other way.It might be time to for Aruba to close some doors again to some countries, better to get a little than nothing at all."
Wow. So sad. I was hoping that Aruba would be able to keep it under control. Let's hope everyone recovers and the rest stay safe
This is horrific news!
horrific yes but not surprising...so sad
"I was so saddened to hear this earlier today.@Garycheryl - please don't make this a USA thing. You have no idea of how it was spread. You are putting all of the US in one category and it's unfair. Where I live, social distancing and wearing masks is the norm. I would never blame Canada for such a thing - I have many relatives who live there."
Agree 100% with garycheryl. I worked in NY and live in NJ. Lost my job over how bad my industry was hit. I have people in my own family who are not taking it seriously. It’s so unfortunate this virus has turned into a political nightmare. I will watch Aruba daily. Supposed to leave September 12th but not if cases keep rising. It won’t be the same since this is my 24th trip but we need a break from quarantine! We will see.
"The report said that the first person was a bartender at Gusto, who recently returned from Holland. Two more people (friends of the bartender) who work at or just train at ""Crossfit Muscle"", and two people who work at Y.O.L.O restaurant and night club are the rest of the five.This was yesterday and since then others have tested positive."
ArubaAmy where are you seeing those details reported?
This was inevitable once they opened their door to touristsMany are coming from hot spots .... it seems anyone who is choosing to head to the Caribbean seems to be going to Aruba or DR
"You thought they had it under control Johnny because its a small island with a population the same as my town and they sealed off their borders. They havent been testing the local population, no one is required to wear masks, nightclubs have been jammed packed, locals have no money, they are not getting $1200 checks like us and they have 12 hospital beds. So next time you want to bash your own country you should think first."
"Before anyone starts pointing fingers, here is a most recent update from Ken Grille who posts daily news in the All Things Aruba page on Facebook:According to the Aruba authorities, this second wave of Covid on the island has nothing to do with tourists coming in from other countries. They stated that the transmissions were caused by locals who came back to Aruba after traveling and did not quarantine and follow the social distancing rules. Some establishments did not follow protocols as well. This is sad because the large majority of the people of Aruba took this seriously and did what they needed to do from the outset. But all it takes is a few as we know from the situation worldwide."
It is all just a matter of time. Time to either get infected or get a vaccine. Masks etc just give us time. Be safe.
"My parents survived the pandemic of 1918. Masks were used, there was no treatment or vaccine.There were over 600,000 lives lost in the US with a population one-third of todays. It's going to take time and effort but we will recover."
56 cases sounds pretty light. Glad to see that Aruba's protocols and precautions are working.
"Bobcat, my mom lived through the pandemic of 1918 as well as her twin and are now living through this one. But said back then, everyone wore a mask. And ArubaAmy is correct in that it wasn't a tourist in this last round."
"@Customer S - Aruba has a national response. Americas national response was to prop the stock market up by devaluing the buying power of the dollar to a tune of $6 Trillion in debt. Americans are losing ground in the eyes of our global neighbors, lets at the least uphold the long standing tradition of questioning our leaders when they screw up!JT"
Garycheryl ... I just returned from the island and local business owners told me the two who broke quarantine were on a KLM flight. I don't know if this is a fact. But I suggest not jumping to conclusions.
"Profguy, I heard the same thing. It was not American tourists who broke protocol, we just get blamed for everything, lol"
"Pforguy,Below is the link to the post about it, that appeared on this very forum.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g147247…I was also told that it was a couple from the USA by our friends on the Island who are also business owners. I also stated at the very beginning of my post that I was 'Not sure if it was the same couple or not."" There might very well be other tourists that have done the same thing from other countries but just have not been caught, we do not know. ANYONE who does get caught though should be fined the maximum amount.I would also like to state that if it was a Canadian that did the same thing I would be posting the same way. It does not matter who did it, it was the wrong thing to do and people need to start calling other people out when they do stupid S**T like this and disregard the well being of others. If an Aruban came to the USA or Canada and did something like this, I am sure there would be an outrage. Sometimes the truth hurts but it does change the fact that it is still the truth.I do think Aruba should have been doing more testing of their own before opening back up. The way they are pumping out test results now, they should have been able to test the whole population of Aruba between March and June. Booked for September, hope we get there so I can see for myself."
"@GaryCheryl - you are so right. Stupid knows no borders. There is a selfishness to this whole covid thing as well, since so many people can carry the virus without symptoms. All I can say is, during the 2 plus weeks I spent on the island, the Aruban people were gracious, courteous and welcoming, even knowing the risks of having outsiders on the island during this pandemic. I can only hope their warmth is not met with disaster and that the outbreak is traced back and isolated to the small number of people currently being cared for.JT"
Very Sad - I also cancelled.Just read Aruba is a LEVEL 3 - Travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Aruba.
It's not just Aruba but ALL international destinations are currently level 3 or 4.
Also per Charles Asch - 89 new cases today 8/6. Just not worth going - next year hopefully!!
"I would not put stock in our State Departments assessment of traveling to Aruba. If you live where I live in South Florida, it is a much greater risk to go to the grocery store then to Aruba"
JT.....Very well said.
"Are the cases in Florida doubling in a day?Aruba is entering an exponential phase:August 6, 2020 – Department of Health numbers show that today Aruba has had an increase of 92 new cases of COVID-19 – active cases now total 146. (144 residents and 2 visitors). August 5, 2020 – Revised Department of Health numbers show that Aruba has 39 new cases of COVID-19 by local transmission – active cases are now 56. The number of active positive COVID-19 coronavirus is 56 (52 residents and 4 visitors). 49 of these cases were by local transmission and the majority are under 39 years of age."
You can't dodge a virus. This is inevitable
"Unfortunately, I blame the outbreak on Aruba changing the pretesting requirements. The initial requirements were strict and accurate enough to detect positive cases prior to arrival. By loosening the testing guidelines to allow for rapid test results that are much less accurate, they were inevitably going to miss some cases.The contact tracing mechanisms in Aruba appear to be thorough and the island people are friendly and cooperative. The problem becomes the visitors that are less cooperative and less respectful of the rules. The rules themselves seem to be poorly communicated and fluid as well which leads to further problems.For those that are going to Aruba now, I suggest taking mask precautions just as if you were in the US. Be safe and stay healthy."
@brokedoc - The word here is that it was a returning resident who brought it back from holland and went to work in the worst place to be (club). Did some testing requirement change allow him to create this?
"even with the change in testing for the hot states, they still had to take another test in Aruba so you can't blame Aruba's change of testing requirements for tourists. This had nothing to do with tourists but with not enough strict guidelines for residents returning or someone returning and didn't follow Aruba's guidelines for self-quarantine. And then working at a nightclub where the contact is huge with others, also all residents."
Anyone who thinks any country (let alone a Caribbean country) has it under control is nuts. All it takes is a few people to slip through the cracks and boom....outbreak
"@Justin - when I went 3 weeks ago, Aruba only permitted NAAT tests for pretesting which have 97%+ sensitivity to detect virus. Some areas are having outbreaks and it was impossible to get the PCR or TMA NAAT tests in that time frame. Aruba then relaxed the requirement to allow the rapid (under 1 hr) tests which are about 70% sensitive. This means 1 out of every 3 asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected person would fall through the screening process. Under the current process, someone testing negative is allowed to go about with no restrictions as soon as they arrive so a single infected person may have 5-10 days of community spread before they are identified as truly infected but then the cat is already out of the bag.Edited: 1:36 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"It seems the use of the word ""Outbreak"" here is debatable. We all have an idea of what an outbreak is. Mine is based on the movie Outbreak. When multiple people start dying in line at Superfoods, then I will agree that Aruba is having an outbreak. And before you criticize my source, understand that what you consider ""science and data"" is equally laughable to others."
"There are 146 positive cases as of yesterday, a 170% increase from the day before. That tells me two things -Aruba is not testing enough people. As the testing rate increases, the percent of positive results decrease. Based on disease progression with other countries, the virus positivity rate doubles about every 3 days when no containment measures are undertaken,Second, the only way for Aruba to eliminate this outbreak will be to shut everything down. If they delay a shutdown, they will have 1000+ cases by the end of next week and will be forced to shut down for even longer. They may choose to institute more strict mask and travel measures like Jamaica and other islands but then will have a steady stream of positive cases and, unfortunately, deaths. Based on what I saw when I was in Aruba, their healthcare system is good but not able to accommodate large numbers of very sick people."
Brokedoc I couldn’t agree with you more. And they should not have allowed testing in Aruba. As tough as that is for some not to be able to go we wouldn’t have had any mishaps with the honor system to quarantine waiting for results. I am sure more than that 1 couple decided to go to dinner and gather in spots before getting results. And their results were positive. Couple that with the local gatherings they now have a huge problem. I will be canceling for September.
And with 119 more reported today our Aruba is not fairing well. I expect drastic changes coming soon on travel to Aruba but know nothing official...just my gut.
133 more cases today!
"I have a difficult time understanding Wally3433's point that the seriousness of Aruba's COVID situation is debatable or that the reported data is ""laughable."" Call it whatever you want but going from 120 positive cases from March through July to 275 positive cases in just the first week of August is alarming by any measure. To put it in perspective, that would equate to almost 60,000 cases in one week if Aruba's population were the same as Florida's. During this same one week period, Florida had 38,000 new cases. So in other words, Aruba's new case rate is 65% worse than Florida's."
"I'm not surprised by some people's reactions ,as they really want to go and just don't want to accept that they shouldn't.I think once tourists head back home,there's going to be quite a few positive tests and quarantines;it's inevitable.They could've been negative when they arrived,but could be positive right now and won't know until they leave.The residents numbers aren't the only ones going up;to believe that is naive."
"Lets start to worry when the number of cases get into the 5,7, 10% of population numbers. Again, take off the US goggles and understand Aruba has an actual national plan that includes contact tracing. This outbreak was inevitable, and it is concerning, but lets watch how the island does in containing it."
"@johnnytram what is their national plan? Good management of the boarder and that is it. They just required masks indoors, just shut down clubs, had barely tested any local people since march. The virus has quietly been there but they didnt start really testing till this week. The have 12 icu beds...all these months did nothing to expand that. The local people are broke and have no unemployment, no $1200 check. The govt is so corrupt the island has no money to continue to pay govt employees. They just had to take a big loan from Holland and Holland is investigating where all their money went. Do a little research and then tell me how great their plan is."
I am going to have to agree to disagree with almost everything Wally mentioned. This is a serious illness and thoughts like this are one of the reasons we as a nation are struggling to control this dreaded disease.

Forgot to mention that residents were arriving without any test. Even now the local population has to meet certain criteria relating to symptoms or have been directly exposed to it in order to be tested. The govt has stated they dont believe testing if you dont meet the criteria is helpful. Aruba is a wonderful island but i dont see a national plan that is so great.
"Customer S- Aruba has protocols in place for businesses to follow as part of the national plan. Including santizing stations, cleaning policies and temp checks at entry ways to certain high traffic buildings. Businesses are fined and potentially shut down for not following rules. Also, they have a contact tracing program for both tourists and locals run by DVG. Now I ask you, what is US national response out side of devaluing our currency to prop up stocks and artificially depress interest rates?Edited: 9:22 am, August 09, 2020 "
"The continued jump in positive cases tells us a few more things. Yesterday there were 113 more new cases out of 1030 tested. This is a positivity rate of over 10% which still indicates they are not testing enough people. Many others who are infected but not tested will further transmit to others. Getting the positivity rate under 5% is a marker that testing capacity is adequate unless there is a complete epidemic.The day before, there were 1060 cases tested. It seems that Aruba is using a similar machine to what we have which has a daily testing capacity of just over 1000 tests per day. If I'm right, Aruba will need to prioritize testing for symptomatic people and travelers may no longer get their results back quickly as it has been in the past few weeks.Another flaw in their screening is not testing travelers under 14 years old. We have clearly seen that younger children can become infected, are more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild disease and can transmit it to others more easily than adults. https://www.businessinsider.com/almost-half-…Edited: 11:29 am, August 09, 2020 "
