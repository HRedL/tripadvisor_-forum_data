"Hi,I will be staying with my family at the Marriott Stellaris from Sept. 8- 13th. I booked a city view room (due to budget issues), but I am contemplating upgrading to an ocean view. How busy would the hotel be at this time during the year? If I wait to upgrade at check in could there be a possibility of a free upgrade??? I have two small children so I know i will be spending most evenings in the hotel room... thats why I am rethinking the budget room. Thoughts?"
"I wouldn't worry about it. Go for a free upgrade when you check in. Think about it. Most of the day, you will be on the beach or out and about. At night when you are in your room. It's dark. The ocean is dark. Nothing to see. The lights of the city are much better and during the day you get to ook at the mountains and Rain Forest. I prefer a city/mountian view."
"I agree, september should be low occupancy, you should be able to negotiate once you get here."
"september is low season but is also a time were conventions, majority of them from here, are planned. So it depends if the hotel has a convention or not, most of the conventions take place in the Rio Grande and Fajardo resorts by the way, so there is a some good chance you might get an upgrade at the Marriott if you are checking in between monday and thrusday, weekend could be a bit harder.Edited: 10 years ago "
"Thanks for the replies guys... but I freaked when I saw the epidemic of dengue fever going on in PR and cancelled my trip. Luckily, since I had just booked it I am getting a full refund. I rebooked for Grand Cayman for around the same dates/price... now all i have to worry about are hurricanes lol. Being pregnant and travelling with 2 small children i didnt feel comfortable with the epidemic going on. Thanks for your help anyway and hopefully I will get to visit your beautiful island soon!"
