the rooms on the 26 floor have a transformer that makes so much noise you cant sleep the bellagio knows of the trouble so we got the bad room. i will never go back to the bellagio!!!!!!
"What was your new room like, after you requested to be moved?"
And how was the rest of your trip??????
Welcome to the forum. We all look forward to many more worthwhile and helpful contributions.
Should I cancel my reservation for next year?
"Did you call and speak to the manager? Ask to be moved? How did they resolve the situation for you? You know, it's really hard to take your complaint seriously because most of us have spent time in the Bellagio and know full well that they pride themselves on excellent customer service. I'd love to hear more about your situation and how they failed you, but you've got to give us something to work with."
"The 26th floor? There is no 26th floor at Bellagio. Truthfully, every hotel has some less than pleasant rooms, and they have to give them out to someone. You should have been able to have your room changed as long as the hotel was not completely sold out. Your problems with noise, while seriously horrible (inferred since it's all that you remember of your trip) pale in comparison to some from this forum who had much worse rooms at the B. Potty splatter on the walls, dead wildlife....I have been very lucky. After many stays the only thing of note is the worn and dated TV. ;)"
"Darn those pesky Decepticons, at it again..."
"btr-l8, Don't try to blame the dead wildlife on the Bellagio - we ALL know you brought that in there! :)"
"lol, Even I'm not THAT mean. Working on it though. ;)"
Working on the assumption that btr-L8 is irreproachably innocent of the crime I would LOVE to have been a fly on the wall of how dead wildlife ACTUALLY made it into a room. I cannot begin to imagine. And reckon it went in alive?Edited: 8 years ago 
"Nice first and only post. Come back again soon with more useful information now that we have all discovered that Bellagio, contrary to a sterling many years long reputation, is really a bad place to stay. As per marc anyway."
"Away from the fun we're having, it seems that a lot of these one time posters (and I'm not yet accusing marc h of anything, I think he should be given time to prove himself just a new member compelled to join our network because of a bad experience) have a nickname that is '(first name) (last name initial only)'. I've noticed that, Hercule Poirot that I am. Might be nothing, Del Boy Trotter that I am!"
"Low had dead wildlife in his B room, too. I smell an epidemic."

I'm not sure it's the epidemic that smells...
No one's asked what these transformers on the 26th floor do. Why they are in every room on the 26th floor. And why they aren't on any other floors. (whisper) What... is... going... on... at... Bellagio? Shhhhhh!Edited: 8 years ago
