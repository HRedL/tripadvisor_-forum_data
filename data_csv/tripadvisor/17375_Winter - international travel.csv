"I know that nobody will yet know the answer, as to whether Canada will be accepting International travellers for the next ski season. Just wondering what locals are thinking may happen"
"It really doesn’t matter how well Canada is doing controlling the virus, that’s not how it works. It’s about the rest of the world. We’re not likely to open our borders if other countries are still having thousands of cases every day. The UK, USA and Latin America don’t have a handle on it yet. We can not risk a visitor bring it in.Edited: 8:32 am, June 03, 2020 "
"Canadians are being advised not to book any international travel until there is a vaccine. I'm guessing that will probably work both ways. The current testing is fairly inaccurate, so I could see a modified option for quarantine on arrival if a reliable quick test was available."
"Locals are thinking - please, please keep the border home, protect our citizens and wait until this virus is under control. Politicians and businesses are thinking - when can we make $$ without damaging our brand...hmm. If it was me, I wouldn't even consider an international trip on a plane right now, seems insane. But also if I had to I would only book a fully refundable fare in case I need to back out."
Thanks for responses - flights booked for January 2021 back in February this year before we realised the seriousness of this epidemic.Certainly we will not be going far for the remainder of 2020.
We did a trip to San Francisco at the end of January and Covid wasnt even a consideration. Incredible how quickly it all changed...and now its almost impossible to imagine living any other way.
"Would you really want to go to a truly international crowd is present. US, England, South America are some of the worst Corona Virus managed countries right now, I do hope that Canada does not open it's borders for any mismanaged country for some time. What about insurance? unless there is a vaccine and you have been vaccinated you will not be able to get coverage and then there is the situation about flying with hundreds of people that you have no idea about their heath and provenance.You may cross your fingers and hope it all goes away.PS I go to Austria every winter to ski and will not this winter. It's going to be a long winter skiing the short hills of Eastern Canada and New England states (If I dare go)."
I’m in the same boat as the OP. We have booked airfares and accommodation in whistler for late jan 2021. It’s all refundable up to December obviously pending decision on travel. We’ll just wait and see how things pan out. Here in Australia at the moment we’ve had a ban on international travelers for a while now and even had our internal state borders closed for travelers from other states. This seems to have helped ‘flatten the curve’ and our daily numbers of new cases have decreased to near zero in most staes - though we’re just going through a second wave in one state (Victoria) . It will be interesting to see if governments choose to only open up Their borders for areas / countries that have been able to manage covid. There’s talk here that we’ll open up with NZ effectively forming a travel ‘bubble’ between our two countries. Maybe Canada and Australia next??
"I think you will have to wait and see for a late January trip to Whistler. If the US was in better shape wrt active infections or they seemed to be changing their efforts from political to health.Today's reported new cases in the States amount to 73,388 (one day!!). That is the highest number of COVID-19 cases by day in the US to date. The number of their active (currently infected) cases is 1,874,274. They seem to be out of control at the moment.International travel for tourism in Canada is not allowed until July 31st. Most Canadians are expecting that ban to be extended. It just won't be until January right now, perhaps for one or two months at a time.As far as BC goes, our infection rate is quite low, but outbreaks of different sizes pop up now and then. Mainly the authorities seem to want Canadians to be protected from any incoming virus spreaders.Yes, I was reading that your NSW-Victoria border was closed due to an outbreak in Melbourne, apparently from a mixture of quarantined hotel travellers and security guards. I don't think Canada will open their borders to a specific area without a great deal of thought. Once a person has been permitted entry to Canada, they are free to travel anywhere within the country and that might prove tricky.Many of us are posting updates in various threads in the forums. There is a sticky at the top of the Canada forum that is trying to keep announcements up to date. So check in every so often."
Our current border closure is in effect until August 21st? Or 30th? Something around there. They are handling it a few weeks at a time.
">> Once a person has been permitted entry to Canada, they are free to travel anywhere within the country Not true. Many provinces and territories, and even regions within provinces, have had, or continue to have, travel restrictions."
"True, under normal conditions, someone who is permitted in to Canada can travel throughout the country. But not during COVID. There is the Atlantic Bubble for example which seems to exclude all other Canadians.I will address the incorrect info in post 10. International travellers are banned from Canada until July 31st. US-Canadian land border travellers are banned to August 21st. Both expiry dates are expected to be extended."
">>>US-Canadian land border travellers are banned to August 21st.The August 21st ""ban"" applies to ALL US-Canada borders, not just land and not ALL US-Canada travellers."
