Is there outbreak of virus in vietnam too? Is it safe to visit?
"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/vi…Edited: 12:26 am, January 24, 2020 "
"The outbreaks of such threads across various TA forums is far more common than instances of the actual virusI arrived in Vietnam yesterday and very happy to be here, enjoying my SE Asian holidayIf you are concerned, then best to stay at home to protect yourself against any risks"
my flight is on 15 feb from India to ho chi minh city. I am deciding should i visit or cancel
"Are you worried about cholera, leprosy, plague in India? Very unlikely you'll have any problems as tourist, I think. The highest risk is maybe traffic."
"Vietnam protocols are very good in this area, they are already all over it. I would not be concerned."
I think you are at higher risk of Dengue fever.
"""my flight is on 15 feb from India to ho chi minh city. I am deciding should i visit or cancel” Oh definitely cancel if it concerns you that much."
I would shudder at the thought of helplessness in the event of a lethal viral pandemic.
Far safer than visiting India I would suggest !!
Hey Hi .I am also from India and travel dates are 14feb-23feb.. but scared and confused.Most probably will be cancelling the trip.
"If after consulting authoritative sources of information (rather than a bunch of strangers on an internet forum!) you are still worried, the only sensible thing to do is cancel your trip."
All foreign passport holders who have been in or transited mainland China in the past 14 days will not allow to enter Vietnam as of February 4 (CP alert)This is a significant measurement and precautionary steps taken by Vn’ govn’t.I am still on my trip for next week as plan.
"It seems corona virus is ""extremely contagious"" which anyone contracted it can be without symptoms for upto 14 days. That means you could put anyone you made contact with at risk not least your family back home should you contracted the virus and be home within 14 days after leaving vietnam...."
"If my flight to Vietnam connects in China and I dont leave the airport, that doesn't constitute ""transiting mainland china"", does it?Edited: 12:22 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"Yes, should contact your airline or agent to reroute the transit or refunds/cancel."
"> If my flight to Vietnam connects in ChinaAll flights from China* are suspended. * Excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan, ... for the moment."

"Here's flights to ""China""https://caa.gov.vn/thong-cao-bao-chi/thong-t…Here's news of Taiwan:https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002010011I haven't seen anything on caa.gov.vn about the backtracking, but it might be tricky diplomatically to draft something that says China doesn't include Hong Kong and Taiwan without upsetting the neighbours to the north.Some airlines have reduced the number of flights to Hong Kong etc, presumably due to reduced demand both ways."
Nothing panic in ho chi min.i m here n all tours goin normal. Appreciate efforts of govt here they r givin free masks to all tourists. No worries here.
"The restriction only applies to mainland China. HK and Taiwan are not applied on that particular restriction. My Cathy Pacific transits in HK to SGN, not canceling so far. Additionally, all APEC card holders must present invitation letter from company/business partner in Vietnam to prove the purpose for business, not leisure. Abit tightening!"
I recommend staying away from Vietnam.
"RE: free surgical masks in airportI have returned from saigon 2 days ago. Pharmacies and other retailers (e.g. ad-hoc hawkers near entrances at Ben Thanh Market) are running out of surgical masks. The free mask at airport wouldn't help for more than a dayEdited: 9:26 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"It is well documented by medical authorities that whilst face masks may help reduce the possibility of you transmitting the virus, they do little to nothing to prevent you from contracting it."
why?
"""why?""Why what?Scott"
ONLY mask N95 helps!!!!!!!!!!! Bring it with you on your trip!
"But how long can you wear the N95 mask continuously? even the one with filter/ventilator valve is not very comfortable to wear for 8 hrs.Edited: 12:35 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"I am bring N95 mask with many extra filters, I plan to wear them in all of my 7 flights, airports and wherever it looks crowded. I leave next Wednesday for Bangkok first, wish me luck.Edited: 9:43 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"Pls share your observations from flights to...the places Thank youEdited: 10:03 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"the tricky part is during the trip, suddenly one develops cold or keep sneezing even it's not the C. virus, and esp. at airport, someone will detain or quarantine you and that's no fun...travel disruptions"
Arrived in Hanoi on Sunday having had a layover in Bangkok for 2hours En route. No body took our temperatures in either Bangkok or Hanoi airports! We’ve been wearing masks since our arrival and have been encouraged to do so by our tour company. They seem to be on top of it and many attractions have hand sanitiser and have given masks to visitors not already wearing one. Still many tourists choosing not to wear a mask but each to their own. Hope this helps
Thank you we are travelling to hanoi 15th feb
Enjoy! You’ll have a fabulous time here.
They have equipment in what looks like a video camera to screen all passengers. All airports do the same.
"""We’ve been wearing masks since our arrival and have been encouraged to do so by our tour company.""This, despite the fact that every medical expert on the planet has said the masks do absolutely zero to prevent becoming infected...Edited: 2:35 pm, February 11, 2020 "
Look you do what you want.... no need for your sarcasm I was asked for y opinion and merely giving it. I’m not a doctor and never pretended to be so off with you with your sarcasm ....
Errr...that isn't sarcasm!!!
"I was just watching the news and our highest medical officer advised that there is no need for the general public to wear face masks but those who work in medicine should. More effective is frequent hand washing or second best, hand sanitiser and avoid touching your eyes and mouth.Also said masks can trap various bacteria if not changed frequently.The virus is in Australia also so I'm going to apply this advice when visiting Vietnam."
"Masks do nothing but act like a breeding ground for bacteria given the nice moist environment they are given!Face masks which are loose fitting, the disposable masks that cover the nose and mouth are designed to prevent the wearer from spreading potentially contaminated airborne particles to people. Face masks are not designed to protect the wearer from breathing in airborne particles, like the flu."

Does not sound good.
"Hi,Did you end of going? Could you please advise how’s the situation there in case you have gone?"

"I am happy to go :) I am not afraid, but I am afraid to be stuck in Vietnam. We are not on a retirement."

"Vietnam has 16 confirmed cases, Australia has 15 and the USA has 14.Would you be scared to go to Australia or the USA?"
"Nao vemos chineses nas ruas, voos da China esstao suspensos. Passamos por Hanoi, hue e agora estamos em hoi am. Turismo acontecendo normalmente."
"don't be afraid if you don't from China, Vietnam is safe now"
"""Would you be scared to go to Australia or the USA?""I would suggest that their healthcare is better"
"It is safe to go to Vietnam since it has reported only a small number of cases (16 cases among 97,000,000 people). All patients have tested negative with the virus and made a full recovery. No new case has been reported since 13th February.Indochina Pioneer"
Yes looks like it is all okay now. No deaths and a 3 month old baby has recovered. Looks like the authorities here have done a good job and for the time being everything is fine.
