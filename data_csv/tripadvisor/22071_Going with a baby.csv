"What can we do/not do? - You will be able to do what you could anywhere else which in general terms will be dining, shopping and sight seeing (both in Las Vegas and outside with a car).There are no specific attractions for babies for obvious reasons.Adult activities such as gambling and bars will be off limits for you as a couple but ok for one of you whilst the other babysits."
"You're 18 weeks pregnant and you want to go away when your baby is 6 months old, so you're basically talking a year from now.First, of all the places I would choose to go with an infant, I don't think Vegas would be high on the list. I probably wouldn't choose any other large city either. Regardless of where you go, there's nothing to offer the baby, but a large city or a place like Vegas is just going to be more work. Long walks to to the room, through casinos, etc... I just can't imagine how that would be anything but more work.Second, you're talking about coming from The UK to do this? That's a lot of air travel for no clear benefit. I don't know if you fully appreciate how you'll feel with a 6 month old. But I don't know many mother's of 6 month olds that wouldn't think your plan sounds awful.Lastly, any detailed suggestions are purely speculative, as I suspect a year from now, Vegas will be functioning at maybe 50-60% of it's typical volume. So who's to say what will and will not even be open at that time."
Check out Marriott Grand Chateau. A 1 bedroom would give you space for baby girl to nap or sleep. Quiet place. Congrats
"mgg42 has covered almost everything. I'd only add:Since you have a year to spare, if you don't already use a financial services provider that refunds ATM fees and provides overnight bank rate FX with no fee, take the time to find one and switch. You'll never have to ask those perennial questions here on TA: ""Where's the best exchange rate?"" and ""Where's the lowest fee ATM?"""
"Time like this with all borders closed and most flights cancelled, best is just to stay home and enjoy life, explore the beauties around you. You’ll be surprised how wonderful your own country is. The money you saved from vacations you can make your home the best you want it to be. Baby don’t need and can’t enjoy vacation, baby doesn’t know the difference. It is irresponsible for a pregnant woman or a new mother to travel internationally with a new born baby. You need to realize and learn your new responsibility as a mother.Edited: 2:27 pm, May 16, 2020 "
Post 6 your last paragraph is the biggest load of nonsense I think I've read in a long time. I travelled with all 3 of my boys when they were babies and it was a wonderful time with great memories. Even more shocking I believe we were very responsible at all times. Get real and stop being so condescending.
What pandemic was it when you traveled with your babies?
"There wasn't one, but I don't believe you mentioned it either, you just made an ill informed crass sweeping statement."
“ Time like this with all borders closed and most flights cancelled”
"The Vdara does not have a casino. It's more like a condo. But they have laundry facilities and a ""separate kitchen and bedroom area."" It's great if you have young kids. The location is wonderful for walking around and seeing other casinos while having the convenience to prepare food for your baby and allowing your baby to nap without needing to tiptoe around. You can ""hire"" a babysitter for when you want to venture out without your baby. My daughter and her family have two young kids and have been doing this for years. They have a great time."
Is it necessary to mention Coronavirus in every sentence? I am pretty sick and tired of this Coronavirus.Yesterday I said I was going to stop watch news during the weekend. I broke my own promise already.
Put your big boy pants on and just face that you said something silly.
"Wow was asking a simple question, not for peoples unsolicited advice on whether I should travel with a baby. This is an advice forum not a place to judge peoples actions."
"@Mac, she's talking about a year from now. Now I don't know what to expect a year from now, but I certainly HOPE we're in a better situation."

"Posts 7-10 I think are pretty par for the course around here. A smart @ss newbie being schooled by a regular. 13Edited: 9:47 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"I don't love the idea of Vegas for you with a baby. There is a LOT more walking involved on the Strip than you might think and most of what you would be wanting to do and see isn't at all accommodating towards infants.""looking to go on one last holiday that isnt child orientated""Haha, I hate to break it to you, but you'll soon be finding out that with a 6 month old your days of doing anything non-child oriented are over! Consider inviting Grandma, then at least you and your partner can slip away for a few hours of fun."
