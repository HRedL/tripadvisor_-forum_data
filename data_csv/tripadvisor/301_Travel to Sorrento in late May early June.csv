Have booked travel on Lufthansa for travel May 24th returning June 14th. I am thinking that things will not be back to normal by that time. I am hoping that September might be ok. What would be my best strategy in dealing with airline and hotels. I had gotten good airfare and hotel rates. I think that demand in September is not knowable at this point. My hotels are fully booked in September but I can't help but think that as this situation continues Many people who currently have September reservations may cancel preferring to wait until next year. Could there be a lot of travel bargains popping up as a result?
"I'm not sure many people are thinking about ""bargains"" right now - given everyone in Italy is on lock down and unable to work....Maybe check again in a few months"
I don't think Italy will open its borders well into the new year for tourism.
"**I don't think Italy will open its borders well into the new year for tourism.**You have been posting this nonsense all around the Italy forum. This is an uninformed OPINION and should be stopped. The latest news is that for the past several days the number of new cases has declined!! That means they have a handle on it and it's getting better, not worse. With the shut down and new medical supplies and help being flown in it looks like things are on the upturn.Donna"
"Thank you Donna.... I was thinking the same thing. I also had reservtions for late May, early June and have cancelled. I am hoping to try againn for September/October. No use thinking anyone is a crystal ball..."
"Yes, thank you Donna. I also have a two-week Sorrento holiday booked for peak season but haven't cancelled yet. The UK holiday company gives me regular updates via email and hopes to resume travel to Italy this summer but it's anyone's guess as to whether they will. I live in hope but becoming more pessimistic by the day.Eddie"

"@3 why you think a pandemic goes away in 6 months? into the air it's gone when the weather gets better there are still positive cases that can infect people, they don't have a handle your posting fake news on the situation in Italy from Italian news reports and others just the way they have a handle on it in NYC today, china has the handle on the virus there oping up the city for travel slowly and no international travel from abroad to China for 3 months on it there is the way to many cases in Italy"
"We stayed at the lovely “Grand Hotel de la Ville” and had such a great time! Amazing service, breakfast to die for, exquisite dinners, gorgeous spacious rooms, away from all the noise and yet very close to the Corso Italia, the train station and the bus station. https://www.delavillesorrento.com/"
