Hi! We have a trip to D.C planned for early April. Original plan was the Cherry Blossom parade and a of the monuments. I know the parade is canceled and the Smithsonians are closed. Is it worth coming still or should we postpone our trip? Thank you in advance!
"If I were you, I would postpone the trip. If you are still thinking of coming, keep an eye on the most recent news regarding COVID-19."
"Cancel. If it involves air travel, definitely not.Even if not why stress the system? People don’t want to be exposed to you. Regardless looks like the peak bloom will be earlier and you will miss it."
"Essentially everything is closed, so there isn't much to do. I would say if someone is driving, and planning to stay just 2-3 days you could fill the time with the outdoor memorials, Arlington cemetery and maybe the Spy museum, which hasn't closed yet. On the up side, it would be really easy to get accommodations right now. I just had all my March and April reservations cancel. Ouch."
Spy museum closed
Clarify Spy museum closed March 16 to at least the 27th per their website
"I sure wouldn't come, seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Why would you even consider coming? If there is anything you want to do that isn't closed, you never know, it might be by then. I guess you could view the monuments but I sure wouldn't come for that."
Please stay home. As someone who lives here now is not the time to visit.
Arlington cemetery is also closed.
"This is not a time for travel, regardless. The WHO has declared a world wide pandemic. The US a state of emergency. Check out how quickly this virus flew through Italy. That could be us in a couple of weeks. At this point our best bet is to slow it down. Flatten the curve as it’s being called. This virus can survive for a few days on surfaces like paper or metal. No amount of cleaning of public places can get around that. Travel later."

I agree with posts 7 and 9. Best now to stay home and not help spread the disease or add to the risk of spreading the disease.
"If all the earlier posts did not convince you not to come, you should also know that the restaurants and bars in DC are ordered close.https:/…Frankly, I cannot imagine anyone who still wants to do non-essential travel."
"If you do still come (not recommended, this post is mostly geared for people who live here and are looking for something to do), here’s a list of things to do/ go to around the DC area that are still open as of Mar 18 (Most require a car)1. Visit Monuments (Visitor centers, Wash monument, other indoor sites are closed) 2. Great Falls Park ( Visitor center closed)3. Fort Washington (Visitor center closed)4. Gettysburg Battlefield (Visitor center and museums closed)5. Go on a bike ride (W&OD trail , C&O canal towpath, Mount Vernon trail, Capital crescent, etc. are still open and usable)6.Go to a drive in movie theater (There’s one in winchester that’s still open)7. Shanendoah national park/ skyline drive/ all the cool hikes 8. Go on a walk in DC (The cherry blossoms will still be there)9. Go on a pedal boat (Tidal basin paddle boats seem to still be open)I’d still recommend staying home, but if you’re coming by car and are crazy enough to not be afraid of the virus, then there will still be things to do around this areaEdited: 1:58 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Planning on flying into DC in July. Already purchased airfare etc. Granddaughter lives there and she says things are beginning to open up and as long as you social distance and wash or sanitize your hands frequently we should be fine.... sure hope so.
Not much open yet. Since you already have tickets no choice. But I personally wouldn’t come. our entire office is working from home this summer.
Watching CNN and Washington DC looks kind of scary right now with all the BLM protests and violence.
"At the moment, touristy things are still pretty well closed. If you do come, you may want to think about what activities you can do outdoors. You may be better off exploring areas outside DC like the state parks/Shenandoah. Some of the wineries and breweries and farm markets in Loudoun county are opening up a bit more and have space to spread out, if that interests you. Of course, this could all change if the situation continues to improve. Let's hope. Stay well."
