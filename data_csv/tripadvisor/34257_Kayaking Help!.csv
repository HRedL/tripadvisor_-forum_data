"Hello! Who: Hubby and me!When: June 24-July 1What: Kayaking with a guide/or on our own So we have our own gear and curious what lakes around the Girdwood/Kenai/Seward areas are good for kayaking? ALSO: we are looking at all the guided trips and has anyone done any of these adventures, and if so I’m desperately wanting to see Orcas and which tour would be the best option for that? I appreciate any advice for any of these!:) -Fox Island kayaking-Caines Head -Resurrection Bay -Orca Island to Three Alpine Glacier"
"If you are not going to test for COVID-19 prior to arrival or upon arrival to Alaska, YOU CANNOT GO KAYAKING!From your other post/thread:>>>We also are a bit worried that if we can’t get tested before and are asymptomatic and don’t realize, then we test positive, that we aren’t allowed to leave Alaska.<<<It would be completely irresponsible of you if this were the case. You would be traveling and exposing people in both directions . . . plus what *IF* you then ended up sick in Alaska.Getting tested before you leave home is for Alaska's protection as well as your own.Also, I can't imagine ANYONE visiting as a tourist in Alaska, and completely honoring the 14 day quarantine . . . not leaving your AirBnB except to obtain medical treatment? I doubt you would follow the rules.If you are so freaked out by the testing . . . maybe this isn't a good time for you to be traveling . . . period!P.S. Anyone planning a trip to Alaska this summer is facing all of the same challenges and concerns. We have a bundle of money tied up on our trip next month; but we are not going to play games to dodge the testing process. Again, I think it would be far worse if we didn't test and was asymptomatic & positive prior to our departure. Sure I would hate to find out literally a day or two prior to our trip that we're grounded, but that is the most responsible and health-aware option of all the scenarios that may play out."
"First: as you have been told by other posters on both your threads, it is unwise not to get tested for COVID before you leave home. The current turnaround for the Anchorage airport testing is 2 to 4 days, with one person reporting have to wait 6 days. While awaiting results you'd have to quarantine in a hotel. That means no kayaking, no hiking, not even leaving the room for meals. The ONLY time you can leave the room is for medical attention. Not much of a vacation.... Now on to the question you just asked. I'm not a kayaker, but I've read several blogs about kayakers raving about going on Portage Lake to see the glacier (but do NOT get too close--calving ice can kill you. Also be cautious around icebergs--they can roll). Here are a couple of descriptive articles with lots of tips, and photos too: https:/… and https://www.gonewiththewynns.com/portage-gla… . Be aware there are regulations about where you can kayak on the lake, so be sure to read them and abide by them.If you look online, you'll find a recent video by a couple of guys who kayaked at Spencer Glacier. And got too close. ...they survived, but both were hit by falling ice and their adventure could have gone south so easily.... Again, if you paddle there, keep a respectful distance from the glacier and icebergs. I just looked it up and here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cTp6HVM5qM . If you prefer to have a guided trip there, contact Chugach Adventures.For paddling in Resurrection Bay: https:/…kayak-and-boat-safety.htmThe ""best"" time to see Orcas is May to early June, but they're around somewhere all summer...and in fact the resident pods stay in the area all year. While you have a decent chance of seeing orcas while kayaking in Resurrection Bay, your best chance is taking a wildlife cruise since it covers a lot more territory. Better still, hire a water taxi for an hour or two and then you can focus on looking just for orcas. Be aware that all boat operators must follow regulations about distance and amount of time spent viewing specific wildlife: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/marine…"
"Thank you so much for answering. My other post was made late at night and not properly explained. Hawaii has very strict rules and that’s where we are from and we’d never be careless and it’s annoying that people keep assuming we’re “one of those people”. We live in a state where that’s very annoying. We have an Airbnb in a very isolated spot with great views and a nice outdoor camp where food is provided for our entire stay so the Quarantine doesn’t affect us. We are coming to enjoy the peace and the views, not go to theaters and be around people as it’s our honeymoon. The only thing it affects is whether we can kayak during our stay...hence I separated my posts Bc they are unrelated and I knew people jump right into being bullies when I just wanted my question answered. We are getting testing done but the state we reside it’s nearly impossible finding anywhere to get tested so I know the airport tests take a few days to get results and we were curious if we didn’t have the results yet would be allowed to leave. I’ve read the mandates and they are all confusing. So that’s what I was more so asking, I think people get way too aggressive about and and rude when I obviously wouldn’t hop on a boat with a bunch of people if we didn’t do the test. I appreciate you answering what the post was for.Edited: 2:56 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Captured, don't know where you are staying, but Eklutna Lake is ideal for kayaking.....They may even have kayak rentals there......"
"“... Quarantine doesn’t affect us. ...”- no but it might affect me. That’s the issue- Being from Hawaii has absolutely no relevance.- You are clearly trying to circumvent the nature of what the mandates are trying to enforce. - what you are proposing is not quarantine... it’s just attempting to stay away from people. - heck, though not illegal, getting on an airplane without being tested is bad enough. - see: https:/…- the responsibility is for you to stay quarantined. It is your responsibility to make sure you do not interact with others unless for medical/emergency reasons. What you are proposing is no different than people who wanted to RV in isolated/remote fashion."
"To further show/explain quarantine...See: https:/…“ What does Quarantine mean?When you are under quarantine, you must:Proceed directly to your designated quarantine location. Remain in your designated quarantine location for a period of 14 days, or the duration of your stay in Alaska, whichever is shorter.You may leave your designated quarantine location only for medical emergencies or to seek necessary medical care.Do not visit any public spaces, including, but not limited to: pools, meeting rooms, fitness centers, or restaurants.Do not allow visitors in or out of your designated quarantine location other than a physician, healthcare provider, or individual authorized to enter the designated quarantine location by Unified Command.Comply with all rules or protocols related to your quarantine as set forth by your hotel or rented lodging.”Note...“ Do not visit any public spaces,...”Edited: 5:46 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"""it’s annoying that people keep assuming we’re “one of those people”.""But that is exactly what you sounded like. As for the quarantine not affecting you...of course it does. It doesn't matter if you quarantine in a remote area, until you have a negative COVID test, you MUST stay inside for 14 days or until you receive your negative test results. No ""outdoor camps"". There WILL be other people at all the places I mentioned. The rules apply to everyone. If people were following those rules properly, the coronavirus caseload in Alaska wouldn't be increasing....and Alaska has very limited health resources.Take a look at the huge upswing of cases graph here: https:/… . And yes, I deliberately linked to a story about a traveler who ignored quarantine since of course they were a Special Snowflake and rules don't apply to them.... And while it doesn't sound like you'd be anywhere near as irresponsible, the point is that without the negative test, QUARANTINE until you get them. No hiking, no kayaking, no grocery stores, no gas stations, no restaurants, no ""outdoor camps"". Part of the story from the above link for those who don't like clicking on links: ""the person was waiting for results from airport testing June 13 and was instructed to quarantine until they came in. Instead, officials say, they attended “several social gatherings and public places” attended by many young people, families and locals on Saturday, Sunday and Monday before their positive test result came Tuesday.""  How many people in Ketchikan are being affected by this one heartless traveler???""I knew people jump right into being bullies""If your definition of a bully is someone who wants to keep Alaska (or anywhere else) as safe as possible from more people bringing in coronavirus, then add me to the list. Twelve people have died in Alaska due to COVID. That might not sound like a lot, but I'm sure their loved ones wish that whoever gave them the virus had just stayed home.Please plan to quarantine 100% until your negative test results arrive. Then you can do your kayaking, tours, etc. BTW, for anyone reading this thread: negative test results have a high failure rate, which means people who think they are negative actually have the virus and are spreading it. Here are a couple of recent studies:https:/…M20-1495 (May 13, 2020) The false-negative rate for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is highly variable: highest within the first 5 days after exposure (up to 67%), and lowest on day 8 after exposure (21%). https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1808 (May 12, 2020) - 56% probability of having COVID even though test is negative"
"Changing your TA name, and deleting your words, doesn’t change what your words said, or who you are, for suggesting you shouldn’t have to adhere to our rules. It isn’t our state’s problem, if your state cannot provide you with the test you need to be able to travel to our state. You can always stay home, and travel when it is more convenient. My elders and my safety matter more to me than your vacation plans. That’s the blunt truth. If you think what was said to you was bullying, you’re some kind of special. And you’re coming from a state, that has made it a mission, to hunt down offenders, and put them on a plane home. Sorry, but you’re exactly why many up here are not embracing visitors, as our numbers rise every day. DebP.S. Please just respect our state and her people, the way your state, and her people, wish to be respected. Seems simple enough.Edited: 7:24 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Maple_Marshmallows, thank you for posting those links. I did want to mention (which is briefly addressed in those articles too) that the positive predictive value of a negative test will go up when there is very little covid cases in the area. I.e., in my town there are very few covid cases. So a negative test is more likely to be a true negative than a false negative. But if someone is coming from a hot spot, then the chance of it being a false negative is higher. Throw some symptoms in there and if the test still comes up as negative then the chance of a false negative is very high! So it depends on the disease prevalence in the area."
"""Changing your TA name, and deleting your words, doesn’t change what your words said, or who you are, for suggesting you shouldn’t have to adhere to our rules.""I didn't realize one could change the TA name! So thanks for mentioning that, I'm no longer a horsemom so changed my name. ;)"
"Absolutely no one here was being mean. Posters, including me, stated facts, and opinions.Because you didn’t like them didn’t make them mean."
I can understand how you feel AcEntire......Sounds like you are taking quarantining responsibilities into your travel plans......Just wanted to encourage you to come back with a trip report with your experiences......they are helpful to so many others who are planning and to have a property owner who is delivering your groceries to make quarantining possible sounds remarkable.....something that other travelers need to know about.......
"Mombear, just to let you know that the OP had another thread, and what was said on that was where the difficulties arose...the OP has removed her posts on that thread though the responses are still there as I type this...will be gone on the next cycle.AMcEntire, I'm glad you clarified your position. You do have a rather unique way of wording things (eg: ""“The quarantine doesn’t affect us” what that means is that we are quarantining anyway"") which have led to misunderstandings.Since you will be quarantining if your test results are not back in time, I'm sure you won't have any more problems with the regular posters here. That's all we wanted to happen.Enjoy your trip."
"The things said were WAY above and beyond ""the facts""....even I understood what she meant by ""doesn't effect us"" too many people want to take any opportunity to attack. I'm not saying that was everyone's intention but yes...there were some comments that took it way to the extreme of what was warranted to get the point across when they really didn't read the intention of the post."
