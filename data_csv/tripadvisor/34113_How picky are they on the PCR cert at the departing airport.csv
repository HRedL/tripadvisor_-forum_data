"I know there is a list of approved labs. At the departing airport heading to Dubai, do they scrutinize which lab it came from or the specific PCR test with a fine magnifying glass, or just glance and pass? I'm pretty sure there are a few different PCR tests, the one I got today only seemed to go around the insides of each nose, not all the way back to the throat like I've seen in some pictures. I asked the tech if it was for a PCR and she confirmed it was. Just hate to get locked up at the airport if they are scrutinizing the lab or the specific PCR test. Thanks"
"What they do is not really the issue in fairness, it's that you don't sound convinced you've used an approved lab. Have you?There are not 'a few different PCR tests"" - there is one standard; it's not Build a Bear. There are many labs and testing options, not all of them approved. The rules are clear - if you're confident you've done your homework and used an approved lab, nothing to worry about.Now, there's a chance your paperwork may not be scrutinised closely, as indeed the opposite is potentially true also. Sometimes it's down to human factors - a ""bad day"", laziness, busy time of time etc. - but do you really want to take that chance? Just because some people's experience may suggest the checks are just a glance, I would always recommend taking personal responsibility to ensure you're compliant.You won't be locked up, but you may be refused boarding or entry or further issues IF there are any hiccups.Stay safeEdited: 3:40 am, August 18, 2020 "
Who said I'm not taking personal responsibility? I'm trying to do my research and not simply crying how unfair it is. No need to get testy bud
Bit of a completely over the top reaction to Shauns sensible post
"Pointless reply by yourself too, we’re not playing tag team here now are we? The OP asked for some advise, clearly showing responsibility to find our about the tests."
"To be clear there a variety of PCR tests, on multiple platforms, not one single ""golden"" PCR test. At least 2 I know of are the SARS-Cov-2, RT-PCR and the SARS-Cov-2, NAA. I have the negative SARS-Cov-2, NAA test in hand, but it doesn't mention PCR anywhere on it. My doctor, the lab tech, and the lab all confirmed its a PCR test. But not saying ""PCR"" anywhere on the sheet, you have to know its a PCR test, hence my original post and worries about getting hassled at the gate."
"The original point, in the first paragraph still stands - and still stands unanswered.If you are confident you’ve used an approved labs as per the rules - which are clearly defined and on many threads here - then you’re fine.That’s what they are bothered about; they don’t need any guff about types of tests etc. PCR test, either via Pure Health screening list, or the list provided by your carrier ( if Emirates for instance) or one that fits the criteria listed in the rules.Hope this is clear enough. That was the point about personal responsibility - it’s commendable someone is trying to research but they don’t reference the key point about whether it’s an approved lab."

"Except when for your country the official list says ""any lab"""
"Then use any lab and be confident that you've followed the rules. Shaun's answer is perfectly valid, as no-one on a forum can predict the pickiness you would or will personally experience. At the departing airport:My own personal experience is that they checked the dates (making sure you took a test within 4 days) at the boarding gate, but not check-in (British Airways then spent 1-2 hours unloading bags of people who did not comply with the rules). There are only a handful of companies who offer a valid PCR test in London, so a print out that looks different to the other hundreds a staff member would have seen at the boarding gate may stick out and receive further scrutiny.At Dubai:No-one checked anything, ever. Not the PCR test, not the health declaration forms, or anything else. At check-in on the way back, we were asked if we had PCR tests and that was it.When I did a PCR test in Dubai for the flight back it was a nasal swab only."
