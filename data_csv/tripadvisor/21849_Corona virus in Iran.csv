We are planning a road journey for 10-12 days in Iran in mid June 2020.Are there any travel restrictions within Iran in view of Corona virus cases?Any restrictions on overland border crossing to Turkey?Thanks
Hi SunjayYes there were some restrictions and surly some others will be in borders but I think it is too soon to know what will happen in June. maybe it will gone by then or maybe not.I suggest to follow the news one month before your travel and then decide. I wish you a nice visit without any problems.take careFaraz
Thanks. I will keep tracking this.
"Hi,As far as I've heard, there are strict restrictions against Chinese... Regarding other restrictions, you need to wait because it seems that it has just started!"
hi thereno body can be quite sure of what will become of corona virus until June. it's too early to decide on that. I recommend you wait until a few weeks before your trip.hopefully things will be settled by June.Regards
‘WIND’ group thanks you all for your inputs.I request you all to kindly enrich me further with whatever is helpful to me in this matter.
"HiDo you think that i must postpone my trip to iran programmed on 12 march 2020?Edited: 2:53 pm, February 23, 2020 "
Up to June be sure every issue will be solved here.
It’s better doing that. Today all schools and universities have been closed for a week.
Hallo. I arrive on 3 March for 4 weeks. I understand schools and universities are closed. What about the major sites. Have they been closed. Any help appreciated.
Tell me the site name or more details. I will update you.
"HICinema - theater - are closed too, attractions at Tehran are functional so far"
"Dear deborahjaneralston, museums and sights in major cities are still open."
"Unfortunately, Iran was named second to China for the number of diagnosed/dead from corona virus. My heart goes out to everyone who is affected, i hope situation improves soon!https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/2…Edited: 4:36 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Dear DeborahMany of the historical and cultural sites are closed at the moment but nobody is quite sure how much longer this will go on,"
#13 No one wanted to be the second. South Korea did not want to but...Tourists will be back.
What is the present scenario of overland Border crossing from Iran to its neighbouring countries like Turkey?
HiAll boarders has been closed specially for iranian. Turkey was the first country after outbreak who closed his boarder.
Thanks for your very helpful update.Is this Turkey border crossing closed for only Iranians?Or is this closed for all people coming from Iran to Turkey even if they are tourists coming from non-Iran nations like India?I hope you all can understand my anxiety and apprehension.Thanks
"It is supposed to be open for transit, at airports!!! For other nationalities heading to their own country if and only if there are flights operating. It's kind of unknown situation. And depends on nationality also.... Weird situation.If you are indian try iraq aiports, from najaf there are. Flights to india. Also mahan air has direct flight from tehran to dehli. Contact Honest guide iran they might be able to guide you in detail"
Thanks dear Foad
"Dear Sunjay PThe outbreak is rapid ! and nobody can predict what will happen by next months. But we all hope that the situation returns to normal soon and make effort for that. So follow the news to make a right decision and maybe postpone your trip, we do care about your health and keep the reservations. Wish you all the best"
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.We also pray for achieving normalcy soon.
Iranian traditional medicine suggests some ways to face the coronavirus which we are going to count them for you.https:/…
"@MohammedI note that your page does have good information on, for example, hand hygiene. However, it also makes a lot of unfounded claims about using vitamins and foods to prevent the virus. I do not believe that any of the vitamin or food related claims in your page can be backed up by proper science. I don't want to be disagreeable, but incorrect health advice can have bad effects on public health. E.g. people taking greater risks in their daily life because they believe that food supplements, masks, etc. will protect them.I'm personally taking a vitamin D supplement. The evidence that it has any preventative effect against cold and flu viruses (which the coronavirus is not) is next to nothing, but in researching it I found that most people in northern climes will be vitamin D deficient at this time of the year. So, I ended up taking it for reasons completely unrelated to the coronavirus and know that it is not protecting me against the coronavirus. Vitamin C is also very unlikely to have any significant protective effect: https:/…coronavirus-vitamin-c-myth.html etc. Taking too much of a vitamin or mineral you are not deficient in can be a harm, not a help.I personally understand that people wish to do something to protect themselves, and there isn't much. I also realise that many people find comfort in alternative medicines. However, in a situation such as we are in now, relying on ineffective methods may be worse than doing nothing - particularly if it leads to overconfidence and non-compliance in other areas. I'm ready to be convinced, and adopt measures, where good evidence can be presented. But, until then, I am concerned that people are being misled. If anyone is interesting in doing something to help Iran at this time, I've personally donated through the Iranian Medical Society UK. https://www.iranianmedicalsociety.org.uk/shopEdited: 5:09 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Dear rossNowadays, almost my grandmother turned to the PDH of Virology. every single Iranian (I'm not sure about rest of the world) have a prescription or heard from someone said so. bla bla it's not that hard to understand nothing can stop an unknown virus except the immunity systeam.... and nothing gana help your immunity systeam to kill the virus...No matter how much vitamin, water, the fruit you eat or do other craps have been giving everyday by new Doctor..... The entire world health science is hands down to this virus so far, and ...... random people providing a way to avoid, overcome, and get better with this virus.... From An specific oil to be apply on your body, to relaxing music, to ......... come one ....Edited: 9:34 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I understand that people are scared by the virus, particularly in Iran though I think similar is rapidly arriving here in Europe.Eating well isn't going to do any harm. I'm taking vitamin D, which was originally inspired by the virus but after research actually happened because generally it's likely to be a good thing - it won't protect me from coronavirus. The harm comes into play if people believe wrong things, and this leads to more risky behaviour. The extreme case of that is probably the person who was licking the Holy Shrine in Mashhad, saying ""o the disease can go inside my body and others can visit it with no anxiety"". That's not only not going to help, it has the potential to spread the illness further. Eating well and taking supplements is unlikely to do harm, unless, e.g., overdoses of vitamins occur. However, if people believe they are protected when they aren't and that affects their behaviour - that can have a bad effect."
"As dear Ross mentioned taking Vitamins- even Vit D- or any special foods have not proved to do anything with Coronavirus so far. Even though currently there is a videoclip spreading in Iran from a doctor _ I think he is not a Physician, but a doctor in another major of medical field- in Australia who is claiming a patient of Coronavirus has been treated by high doses of Vit C. But so far this is just a claim and has to be confirmed by research.Edited: 6:30 am, March 15, 2020 "
"By The way, as all of us know there are many Pharmaceutical factories who claim taking vitamins and supplements improves body""s immune state and will provide somehow immunity from catching infections. But these can be true if somebody has a deficiency in some vitamins or trace elements in his body. Otherwise if somebody has a normal and complete dietary regime, taking extra vitamins or supplements might not have do anything."
