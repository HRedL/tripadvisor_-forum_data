"Residents of Tulum told drastic actions to be taken after mayor reports “alarming increase” in infectionsBy Riviera Maya News on July 15, 2020https:/…2020.html"
Yesterday morning they re-instated the check point entering Tulum.
What is this check point about? Temperature and symptoms? I’ll be there next week
I was on bike passing. There was talk about the mayor shutting it down but I dont think that’s going on. As a tourist you probably will have no issue. I stopped and watched for a bit and they were talking to drivers but no one was not allowed in. I wouldn’t worry too much. Just make sure you have a mask for everywhere you go. They will make you use hand sanitizer which they will provide. 98% checked our temp entering and you will wipe feet or walk on a sanitary towel. Go and enjoy- just use common sense about the mask
"Interesting if they're letting tourists off, while it's likely mostly tourists who are bringing the virus to them. This challenge of balancing economic health with medical health and safety is so critical, hope they can find a way to make it work (as with everywhere in the entire world right now). I'm not judging anyone for going or not going, we each have to make our decisions, it's just so hard."
I could have predicted this a week ago based on percent positives...
"No surprise. It is just a question of when not if the whole region will be on a total lockdown and shutdown again. All tourists will be sent back home and new will not be allowed in. Simple as that. Recreational tourism just can't be considered essential. Period. Am I happy about it? Ofcourse not, because I am getting tired of all this chaos up and down."
Well Paul to a degree tourism is essential. We helped create this mess. Playa-Tulum were relatively speaking not too long ago sleepy little towns. Then we came- and continued to come. Money flowing into area’s that had little. The region grew as a result based of this. Their economy became this. So it is now essential to a degree as without it a total collapse could very well happen. Their fault? No ours.  The state if things is a mess and it is tiring. Who knows how the world changes and for how long. I has done the environment some good ( look at what is happening in Bacalar for example). It would nice if this could help bring about responsible tourism. Doubtful
"mexico may well go the same way as the EU and ban american tourists,,,,the virus is out of control back home and many americans still argue over something as simple as wearing a mask to help stop them infecting others,,,which is fine if they stay back home but many of them are coming here,,,,US sees record single-day spike with 67,400 new COVID-19 casesCDC director says US can get coronavirus 'under control' in 1-2 months if everyone wears masksThe U.S. is currently dealing with worsening outbreaks in several southern and western states."
"Holbox reopened on July 1 after total lockdown and zero cases. As of Tuesday they have reported 30 positives and one death, with no hospital on the Isla. It took Only 14 days. I completely understand the need for tourism but being open for business is not walking a fine line but more like the edge of a cliff. And the fact that people rush in because they “need” a vacation just blows me away. Responsibility lies on the municipalities and on the travelers."
"holbox must close down again,,,to dangerous for them to open"
"Fine or jail time: Tulum mayor announces mandatory wearing of mouth masks in publicBy Riviera Maya News on July 16, 2020QuoteMouth masks are mandatory in public spaces and those found not wearing them will be fined, announced the Secretary of Public Security Alberto Capella Ibarra and Tulum mayor, Víctor Mas Tah.Capella explained that for those found not properly wearing mouth masks in public, a fine of up to 9,000 peso or 36 hours of jail time will be the result. He added that 200,000 mouth masks will be distributed to citizens in the municipality of Tulum.UnquoteFull report: https:/…2020.html"
The hospitals in some areas of the Yucatan are now at capacity or very close to it because of COVID-19.. Hard to see this not occuring fairly soon in Cancun and Playa del Carmen as well. Do you really want to be there on vacation if this happens?
I didn’t pass through a check point- we went to Dos Ojos on the late morning on the 14th and came back into Tulum Pueblo around 1 or so.
This may turn out to be a short-term gain/long-term pain situation. Trying to save Summer 2020 might result in losing business for the next high season which many people are looking to book right about now.
"Can those of you who have traveled to Mexico in the last couple of weeks please tell me how you justify it? This is an honest question- i am not trying to pick a fight or start a huge riot here. I'm genuinely curious. How can you justify travel, especially international travel, during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC? Again- asking for sincere answers."
You are trying to start a fight. It was the way you phrased your question. At least be honest. You framed your question with an accusatory statement.
"Gomero, I can empathize with someone who bought tickets/booked a package pre-February 2020 and either can't get any sort of compensation / compensation is less than adequate if they cancel."
"Ok, Newdoc... where is there an accusatory statement? I am honestly curious. I can't personally justify any travel at all right now, but that is just me. You seem to be defensive about this... why? So I guess I""ll rephrase my question so it doesn't upset you. Have you traveled to Mexico in the last month?How did you justify this travel?"
Mike V- I suspect that your answer is the case for most. I'm till wanting to hear from the traveled masses though.
"Gomero, not everyone has succumbed to the hysteria. It is not the bubonic plague."
A naysayer is correct for a change. Over the last 20 years the plague has only affected 1 to 17 persons a year in the US with a death rate of about 10%.
"Copilot- The Bubonic Plague is found in squirrels and other rodents all the time in the western USA. It is treatable with antibiotics in humans, so i'm not sure what your point is."
"I can honestly say that precautions in Cancun Airport and Tulum are far superior to those in most parts of the United States. My temperature was taken at the airport when I arrived along with hand sanitizer. Masks must be worn and everyone was obeying. I was greeted with hand sanitizer and a temp check AGAIN when I got into my transport to retrieve my rental car. Once I arrived at the rental car, temp was taken again with more sanitizer. At the gas station, the door way opened for me and I was given more sanitizer in the shop and also before I handed pesos to fill up with gas. Every restaurant I’ve been has temp checked and given sanitizer. Not to mention, they have shoe sanitizing stations at every store/restaurant/etc before you walk in. It’s mandated here you MUST wear a mask in public or risk jail time or a fine. People are vacationing in the US or even just going to the store to grocery shop and doing their daily activities using ZERO of these precautions. Even the police in the cities in the US that have mask mandates even state that they aren’t going to enforce the mask law. That’s how I justify my travel."
"I don't typically jump into a hot topic but you asked how one justifies travel. For me and my fiance who will be traveling to Cancun and PDC on 7/27 it was this....We both work from home, very healthy and somewhat fit, have mostly stayed home since March other than the necessary store trips, since they opened dining we have been wearing our mask and we've stayed away from people not wearing theirs. We have both been tested twice for covid in the last two months, most recently 10 days ago. We plan on wearing masks everywhere and always plan to carry gel even though most resorts/restaurants are providing by the bucket full. Upon our return since we do have the luxury of working from home, we plan on a 14 day quarantine. It is a personal choice and we completely understand the risk of getting covid and as long as we do not put anyone else in harms way by doing the right things we hope like other travelers who have visited and are now home all goes well."
"I traveled, my justification is I wanted to go to Mexico with my family that I hadn't seen in more than 7 monthsWe were extremely cautious and kept to ourselves. I quarantined before and am again now that I'm back.I saw a lot of people being careless but also many being extremely carefulI cannot live in a rabbit hole and stay put ""until there is a vaccine or a cure."" It is fine of course if others want to. I am not one of the people on TV without a mask, in a mass group acting carelessly, but I will travel (carefully) so long as I live"
"For my wife and I, we had to skip our timeshare week at the end of April. We also have one coming up in the beginning of September, and can’t keep adding weeks onto next years stay. Our units are Beach Front First Floor at the Royal Haciendas. We are going to go if we can in September. We plan on wearing N100 particulate masks I have from where I used to work for the Air travel, and wipe everything down before we take our seats. As for worrying about the resort, they have adopted a strict cleaning regimen and health checks protocol. I have more faith in the Royal Resorts then I do in most local establishments. So I would justify our choice to go with two factors: Risk Mitigation and not wanting to loose money."
"All great answers, and exactly what I was looking for. I am not living in a hole either, though I do live in Montana- it is easy to avoid people. People here are not all using precautions which is worrisome for sure. The real reason I asked is because I need to travel to see my Dad. His health is crap, however, and I""m not able to quarantine on either side of the trip. I just don't see any way I can fly to see him and KNOW that I won't infect him. Tough times. Also great to hear that these precautions are happening down there- imagine if we had taken it that seriously here?!!"
"I should correct my comment because certainly some are too at risk to travel or have too many other circumstances so they cannot travel until things improve. I'm lucky to not be in those categories. It does not necessarily mean they ""live in a hole,"" sorry for coming off that way!"
MR0213- no offense take at all.
Exactly. People are extremely brainwashed by the fear in the media. We don't all succumb to the dramatized anxiety about it
"From Wikipedia:""The Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality, or the Plague)[a] was the deadliest pandemic recorded in human history. The Black Death resulted in the deaths of up to 25–200 million[1][2][3][4][5][6] people in Eurasia and North Africa,[7] peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. """

"You know what, I was really worried when I came on today and found four pages here, but I think for the most part it's been a good conversation, that's great to see! Personally, I have been back and forth more time that I can count, but am still planning (I hope) to get to Tulum this fall sometime. As others have said, I can work from home, so quarantining is not a problem for me. In fact, if I bring my laptop on the trip with me (as I will), I could even quarantine down there if needed. The reports of the serious attitude of most local businesses is reassuring, and I know the airlines are, for the most part, doing the best they can as well. A side note here: A pilot friend of mine told me years ago that the air that comes out of the jet above one's head is very clean, HEPA-filtered air, so the best thing to do when seated is to reach up and turn that thing on full blast (this was more recently confirmed by a doctor I know who travels a lot), especially straight down in front of one's face, to create a kind of air wall. This doesn't always work thanks to the fact that half the time, my jet hits the center of my skull, but it did make me feel better about air travel (with other precautions, of course!). Anyway, refreshing to hear good conversation about this incredibly uncertain topic! Wish you were all my Facebook friends. :-)"
This thing is everywhere only way to control is with a vaccine. Really a vaccine is the only way to control or the numbers of infected will always be there.
"""CDC director says US can get coronavirus 'under control' in 1-2 months if everyone wears masks.""Until that does not work then they need to quarantine 100% of people until the virus dies off. Then no travel anywhere for anyone.When the CDC director changes their message to identify the people who are at medium to high risk if they are infected by this virus, along with actions that they have to take to prevent catching it, instead of the ""Wash hands, wear a silly mask and stay away from everyone,"" they have little credibility."

Hi! Can anyone update on the cenotes near Tulum like Dos Ojos? Are they very busy right now? And is Kaan Luun Lagoon open?
"Go in the morning, and you might have the place all to yourself until more people start arriving around noon. That's what it was like last week at cenote Jardin del Eden.Don't know about Kaan Luun."

"#28 Gomero, you are kidding right? ""imagine if we had taken it serioulsy here?"" The entire US economy was shut down for 2 months, 10s of millions temporarily lost jobs. Air travel from other countries was banned. A large part of the country had its civil rights violated with illegally imposed isolation that some fancy up and call ""quarantine"" Id say it was the most serious event in most peoples lifetime."
"I'm not the boss of this board, but we were doing pretty well keeping the political takes to a minimum.

I'm not calling anyone out, I know everyone has passionate feelings about it, just let's keep the fighting to Facebook (or wherever). Please?"
Can someone actually say if things are open or not? Can people travel to Tulum or no?
"George, why risk going when things can shut down with little notice. I see no reason to plan a trip until they get to normal conditions."
"""4 months too late. Dude politicized it and now we have a chunk of society who thinks the deep state is trying to take away their rights. ""Fake Fauci and the CDC told us then not to wear masks.This is a flu event.Quarantine those at risk and everyone else lives life normally without silly masks."
Good answer. Only reason I wanna go is to get out of the states before the election (didn't want to talk politics here and spend a few months away until things settle down)
"Here is a possible good look at what could happen. Read the posts by MisterB266 (Playa del Carmen and Cancun forums).If they revert back to a red condition, supposedly the hotels can still be open at 15% occupancy. I can't say if they will stay open but ideally they would or you could move to another hotel that would be open.Assume that nothing else is open outside hotels.Maybe the beach is open for use...or maybe not.There is some risk but if reversion to red status means you can relax on the beach or pool and enjoy the views and you are happy with that, have a great time."
"This is terrible news, whats the chance of you traveling on a plane with no infected people,?This is why wearing masks and washing hands are so important.US is on track to record 1 MILLION new coronavirus cases in just two weeks as the daily death toll rises to its highest since May - while Texas sets single-day high for fatalities and California sees record 12,000 infections in 24 hours."
Rick Cole Id say the odds are highly likely you could travel on a plane with no one that is infected even if one was to believe those extraordinarily inflated numbers you cited.
"i got the ""extraordinarily inflated numbers"" from fox news but i realize you cannot trust much fox news says,,,,https:/…"
"Correct, the point of what I said is that all the numbers reported are hyper inflated. One single city, San Antonio TX, had to reduce its positive count this week by 3500 cases because they count possible cases, anyone that comes in for a test, as positive. Florida had to reduce 32 hospitals positive cases by over 10,000 last week for the same thing. Now say that happens in just 30 cities in a country with thousands of cities and you’re looking at easily over 100,000 cases that don’t exist, I’d hazard it’s far more than that, the numbers reported don’t work. Do the vetting of what news sources tell you, quit using those ridiculous numbers as a scare tactic."
"heres another souce,,,,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-855…"
"im not sure these figures are much better ,,,,,,,but lets hope they are wrong as wellUS cases took 16 days to go from 3 to 4 millionThe total number of coronavirus cases reported in the United States has passed four million, reflecting a rapid acceleration of infections detected in the country since the first case was recorded on January 21,It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases, but just 16 days to go from 3 million to 4 million, according to Reuters and Worldometer tally on Thursday. The average number of new US cases is now rising by more than 2,600 every hour, the highest rate in the world."
"you didnt read a single thing I said, Off you go to quote more false numbers. Case numbers mean nothing death rate is what is important, we could all have it and it means nothing unless we are all dying from it and we are not. More than half of the US deaths have been in nursing homes. Stop drinking the coolaid and spreading fear, lies and useless information. I see you have 6 posts are you just here to troll the forums?"

"""whats the chance of you traveling on a plane with no infected people?""If 200 people are on a plane and each have 99% chance of being covid-free, there's about only 13% chance the flight is covid-free. That is, a 87% chance at least one person has it. Straight math."
"""""Case numbers mean nothing death rate is what is important""So getting cancer is no big deal unless it kills you? Whatever dude.""When roughly 85% of people have no symptoms and a another chunk of people may have minor to flu level symptoms, yes, mere numbers of infected people seems to be used to maintain hysteria.People at risk of suffering the most need to take extraordinary measures to ensure their safety and not rely upon people wearing silly masks.Edited: 6:13 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"""US cases took 16 days to go from 3 to 4 million""That implies a 1.8% daily growth. While it seems small it means the total doubles every 40 days. Unless the growth abates, it will go from 3 million to 24 million in 4 months. Let it grow at that rate for 8 months and 3 million becomes 192 million. 1.8% doesn't sound so small anymore. Straight math."

"Jjeter69 - thank you for your post. I’ve seen firsthand how these numbers are recorded and you are absolutely right. If you’re in line for a test, don’t even get the test because they ran out, you get a letter in the mail stating you are positive because you were there! Not discounting that there are cases, but it is way over inflated!! I think people are starting to see that and that’s why they are getting so “over it” and frustrated!!"
