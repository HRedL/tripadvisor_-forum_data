It is my understanding that the state of Alaska is requiring negative PCR/molecular COVID-19 for passengers arriving at the airports to avoid 14-day quarantine. The new Rapid Test available is a different kind of test (not molecular/PCR). My question is if the state is accepting results from Rapid Test from passengers arriving at the airports. Has anyone been able to get Rapid Test Results accepted? Note that these are different than the anitibody test which the state has indicated that are not accepted.
"At least in my area, there are a couple of different types of rapid tests. There's an antigen test and a PCR test. As best I understand, they will take the rapid PCR (by Abbott Labs and maybe others) but not the antigen test (by Quidel). Would love for them to take the antigen test because that would really make our planned travel next week much less uncertain but everything I've ready to this point is pretty clear that it's PCR only."
"Thank you. Yes, It is pretty clear regarding PCR being accepted. The Rapid Test Authorized by FDA and available in my area is the Sofia test (it is of the antigen type made by Quidel). However, in the FAQ and during Wednesday's Press Conference (available on Facebook - minute 35) Dr. Zink, AK Chief Medical Officer, indicated that the state is indeed doing rapid test at certain airports for certain people. That made me think that if they are doing it for some passengers it may be acceptable for those who have gotten prior to arrival at the state. These are the test accepted according to the state's FAQ posted here https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/:A molecular-based SARS-CoV2 test is any of a number of tests that detect the presence of viral RNA (genes), such as reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR, e.g. Cepheid GeneXpert, KIngFisher System, ABI 7500 system), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA, e.g. the Hologic Panther system), and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification (e.g. Abbott ID-NOW).None of the antigen/rapid tests are listed. I have emailed them (traveler@alaska.gov) asking for clarification but no response so far.Edited: 9:13 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"""You must receive a negative result from a molecular-based test such as a PCR test. Alaska does not accept serology/antibody tests."" …alaska.gov/dph/…travel.aspxIf you can't get a PCR test within 72 hrs. of boarding the plane, you *likely* could get a test at Anchorage if they have enough tests. Quarantine after that currently is 3 to 5 days (their eventual goal is a 2-day turnaround), see post #32 here: https:/…106944902"
The rapid test is not a PCR/molecular test (accepted) or a serology/antibody test (not accepted). The state needs to clarify if this third type (antigen/rapid test) is accepted.
"Agreed! @Alexander, if you hear back from them, please post your findings. We have to be tested Monday for our Thursday flight and if the antigen test is acceptable, it makes things dramatically easier for us!"
"do you have a link to the test you would like to take?I found this:What kind of tests are accepted?Posted on June 12, 2020Alaska accepts only molecular-based tests such as the PCR tests – antibody/serology tests are not accepted.Alaska accepts results from FDA-approved home self-test swab kits.A molecular-based SARS-CoV2 test is any of a number of tests that detect the presence of viral RNA (genes), such as reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR, e.g. Cepheid GeneXpert, KIngFisher System, ABI 7500 system), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA, e.g. the Hologic Panther system), and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification (e.g. Abbott ID-NOW).Edited: 9:53 pm, June 17, 2020 "
It is the Sofia test by Quidel described here:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announ…This is the one and only rapid test (antigen) authorized by the FDA for COVID-19
"Alexander, from your own link ""antigen tests may not detect all active infections, as they do not work the same way as a PCR test. Antigen tests are very specific for the virus, but are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests. This means that positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection. With this in mind, negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with a PCR test"""
“ The state needs to clarify if this third type (antigen/rapid test) is accepted.”- No the state doesn't have to clarify. They are clear in what they accept. It’s you not liking the clarity that seems to be the issue.
"I am looking for an answer to my question. Not an opinion. I will continue to ask the state if the test is acceptable, particularly when they are using it themselves."
I’m not stating an opinion. What the state accepts is a fact.They don’t say they might accept a whole bunch of other stuff. They state what is acceptable.
"I agree with Scott on this one! We as travelers AND GUESTS to Alaska need to accept their requirements. Trying to find an ""easy way out"" isn't going to be helpful, especially if you happen to get misinformation and then upon arrival have a big surprise.We too are scrambling with the pre-arrival testing. I've tried to get information for the DHS in Anchorage . . . and have been given misinformation or conflicting information twice already. I want to do what is required, but questions as simple as ""is the requirement 72 hours before getting on a flight TO Alaska or is it 72 hours getting on the first flight from home enroute to Alaska"" has garnered varying responses from Alaskan officials.In our case, it makes the difference of about 9 hours, which is essentially a full day . . . can we test on Wednesday prior to departure . . . or must it be Thursday . . . to meet the 72 hour requirement? The interpretation matters.In our case, we'll probably have to go with the 5 days in advance by default, because I don't see us getting the test on Thursday morning, and having the result in hand by the time we depart.I am glad, however, to read that we don't have to have it in writing, that via email will suffice."
"Thank you. I am not questioning their requirement, but clarifying if this other test qualifies. This is new for everyone, including the state, so I am not sure it clear to anyone. I am definitely playing it safe and will get a PCR test since that is clearly stated as being accepted. Thanks everyone."
"I have the same question you have -is a negative result on a rapid test accepted? Have you found any more information? I am more than willing to respect the rules posted by the state, and as a visitor, I want to make sure I do my part. It makes it a bit harder when the responses I receive from state officials vary depending on who answers my emails/phone calls. Just like you, I will go with the PCR test that takes 2-4 days for results, hoping I get my results back on the 72 hours required window. Otherwise, we will need to proceed to plan B and be tested on arrival. All new territory for all of us. Confusion is inevitable"
From all I have read I am pretty sure that only the PCR test is acceptable.
"Here comes my confusion: ""There are also two rapid PCR tests, which can be run on specialized equipment already widely distributed throughout the U.S. The speediest one, by Abbott Laboratories, can provide a result in 13 minutes, but one study suggests this test can miss more than 10% of cases."" Not all rapid test are PCR, hence my confusion as to where to go for the rapid PCR test that is accepted and if authorities in Alaska will allow it. I am still trying to schedule the non-rapid PCR test and get my results under the 72 hours windowSource: https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…"
"Did they accept the test? We leave on July 19 but flying to Juneau, not Anchorage"
"We arrived in Anchorage on June 29. We went with the non rapid test at CVS (we live in Rhode Island).As soon as we received the results, the morning of our trip, we filled the electronic form for the entry to Alaska. As soon as we submitted, we received an email with a QR code.On arrival, those of us that had that code went directly to the desks where they checked our paperwork (bring a copy of your results, on paper, or the email). The process was less than 5 minutes. They scanned our QR code and on the spot we received an email with information about where to go if we wanted to go for the follow up test in the next 14 days."
Thanks for the follow-up information Gabriela! This is helpful to anticipate the process when we arrive tomorrow night (assuming we get our COVID-19 test results back today or tomorrow AM before heading out to the airport).
"Yes, we had no trouble. We brought a paper copy of our test results (she said email was ok too). When she took our results she highlighted the top where it said ""SARS-COV-2 RNA, QL, RT PCR (COVID-19)"""
"We decided to wait until the last possible minute to fill out the electronic form since you have to select one option (you had test done and have the negative results back, you had test done and you are waiting for results, you didn't get the test and will get it on arrival, you will quarentine)We are glad we waited, since we received our results the morning of our trip, actually while we were in Chicago on transit to Anchorage. As soon as we filled the form we received the email with the QR code"
"It’s really on the honor system. It’s not rightly regulated and are just hoping no one comes with the virus. Haven’t heard of any result being rejected and one of my travelers didn’t even have his results back yet and it’s been 2 weeks, he’s heard nothing. They don’t follow through. It’s on a honor system."
"Has anyone gotten tested within 72 hours of departure for Alaska at Walgreen's with the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test? Was it excepted at the airport? My husband and I were tested this afternoon and received negative results. We leave on Friday morning. There is some conflicting information on this and another thread about whether this test is excepted or not. It is not a PCR test, but it is a molecular test. Thanks!"
Luvvacation58...- see a response in the other place you posted this question.
"It is quite possible that they won't reject any test results or follow through, having said that, I wouldn't risk having to quarentine if they do check or follow through. We spent thousands of dollars to get here and it would be a pity to have to spend any time in a hotel room waiting for results. We are at the end of our 16 day road trip in Alaska and it has been epic! Totally worth going through the extra requirements to enjoy the privilege of this amazing place!"
"This is so confusing for lay people, esp if your email inquiries are unanswered. I am a microbiologist that performs PCR testing for covid-19. I am taking my second trip to Alaska in July 2021. PCR testing can be rapid or not, based only on the instrument being used. Single one-at-a-time testing takes 50minutes. How many other samples are ahead of you, can make the TAT (turn around time) several hours longer. The PCR test that takes 2 or 3 days (can be longer) is a batched testing system at large labs, typically not done locally. Shipping takes time, then the test is performed. The Sofia 2 assay (rapid antigen) is a terrible test! It's no wonder Alaska doesn't accept it. Get a proper PCR test; latest I read from links in TA, indicates travel can begin as long as test PCR results pending.I hope it's a lot easier in 2021!Edited: 10:08 pm, July 16, 2020 "
"agreed! i'm hedging my bets by getting tested on monday for a tuesday flight. my previous test results came back within 24 hours, so fingers crossed. egads for flying out on a tuesday when i can't find places testing on saturday, i might try a minute clinic on saturday and then cancel the monday test."
"Anyone flew to Alaska recently with non PCR test, but rapid antigen? Interested in the last couple of weeks. Flying with rapid negative test, hoping they won't get us tested for PCR."
"According to the Alaska travel website non-residents arriving with a non-PCR test will be required to test at the airport for $250. We used a home test kit from EverlyWell on Monday and had the results 24 hours after dropping off at UPS.""A non-resident that does not arrive with proof of a negative test taken within 72 hours of departure or proof of a molecular-based test for SARS-CoV2 taken, but pending results will be able to receive a test for $250 at the airport upon arrival."""
"Adding on to SouthBay's info, you'd have to quarantine until you got the airport results back. That could mean 2 to 4 days cooped up in a hotel getting meals delivered to your door....The rapid tests have a much higher false negative rate which is why the PCR test is required. Possibly you might slip through by mistake, but don't count on it.Use one of the home-tests such as referred to above:""Travelers unable to get testing prior to travel are encouraged to purchase an at home test kit. There are four FDA-approved home-collection COVID tests:Pixel system from LabCorpEverlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection KitVault HealthPicture Genetics""https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/ (about 2/3 down the page under ""Interstate"", then ""For travelers who are unable to find a testing site"", contains live links to the various options)"
I recommend Everlywell. Quick turnaround
How did it go? Did they let you in?
"We tested at Walgreens yesterday 8/30 at 1pm (flight leaves Wednesday 9/2 at 8am). We got our results emailed to us at 4:30pm today, BUT they dated the sample as being taken 8/29 instead of 8/30. Ugh. We live in Washington DC where the district provides free walk-up testing every day at our local fire station, so we did that tonight- we did a trial run 2 weeks ago and got results in 36 hours, so hoping that happens again. We also took the Pixel by LabCorp test this morning and sent it off, hoping that at least one of them will get us results by the time we arrive on Wednesday! We'll be prepared to quarantine just in case, which would hopefully be for just a short period of time until we receive the results."
Kelsey...- Awesome of you to post your experience to date. No one knows what kinds of good things or bad things can happen in this 'world of never happened before'.Good luck
