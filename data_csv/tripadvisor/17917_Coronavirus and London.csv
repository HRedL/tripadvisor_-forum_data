"Hi everyone. My mother and I are are due to visit London for a week come March, 21st and wasn’t to concerned with Coronavirus but like many I’ve been overdoing it on an excessive news cycle.I’m curious to see what everyone’s thoughts are on this trip. All and any positive thoughts and opinions are welcome. Thanks!"

"Why the thoughts of random, unqualified people on social media should matter to the OP I have no idea.Educate yourself by reading medical information by qualified people. Avoid sensationalist newspaper drivel. Follow official medical advice."
5 cases in London - out of a population of over 8 million
Coronavirus isn’t the only topic people need to be aware of. More people died from the flu this year despite mass vaccinations to create herd immunity.
London is as normal.
My husband and sons are due to fly from nyc to London on March 12. Naturally it’s concern.. they’re young and healthy so my concern is mainly how it would be in the event of a quarantine while there. We just plan on monitoring the situation during the upcoming days.
"@ no.8 thats all you can do really, no one knows the final extent of coronavirus but we're not running around like headless chickens shouting the end is nigh at the moment."
"I love the British pragmatic attitude. You can catch CV anywhere now, and London is remarkably low in cases. Its travel disrupted and tourist attractions closed that are the issue right nowEdited: 12:01 am, March 06, 2020 "
"All sorts of contingency plans and preparations are being developed, but whether or when or where they'll be out into effect - nobody knows. Not today or tomorrow, almost certainly not next week, most likely not next month, probably not this side of the start of the next school term. Thereafter - it all depends on too many unpredictable variables.There is concern, but no signs of major public reaction (few, if any, face masks), let alone panic (though I haven't done my big shop this week). ""Watch and wait"" is about as much as anyone can say."
Here's the official advice at the moment:https:/…
"Dustin, unless you’re lucky enough to live in a country which doesn’t yet have the virus you’re likely to be in a similar level of danger as soon as you head for your local airport. That is, a very very low risk.Edited: 2:28 am, March 06, 2020 "
"If you take all reasonable precautions you’ll greatly minimize the chance of catching this virus, anywhere. Wash your hands every hour for the duration of “Happy Birthday” once or twice, or the National Anthem (either country) or if you’re really really concerned do Bohemian Rhapsody. Carry tissues or napkins from restaurants and have them immediately to hand if you want to wipe your face or pick your nose. Carry hand sanitizer as a stop gap between washing your hands. If you touch anything that’s touched by others (hand rails, touch screens) use the hand sanitizer. And as soon as humanly possible wash your hands for the entire length of Beethoven’s Fifth. Use your sleeve or coat sleeve to open doors, and then within ten minutes discard your coat/jacket, and buy a new one at Selfridges for £500. Alternatively just wash your hands to the Eastenders theme tune, or rather than watching that drivel wash your hands for the entire episode. Have a great trip."
"Before coronavirus, people used to laugh about my OCD. Now they copy me!"
"It looks as though the situation's developing a bit faster than I thought:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…Perhaps the moderators should pick a thread for a sticky, to avoid endless new threads on this. They might have to do it for all countries!"
"Think on this...A Harvard epidemiologist reckons 40 to 70% of the worlds population will get infected, a UK government scientist reckoned up to 80% of the UK population would be infected - that’s entirely consistent if you reckon we are a densely populated island so transmission could well be higher than average.Even if you think that the upper estimates are unnecessary doom mongering you’ve probably got to concede that your (and my) chances of getting infected are 50/50 or worse, and that’s world wide, not London or the USA. 70% or so of those cases will be mild, only the over 60s and those with pre existing medical conditions have much to concern them, if you are over 80 things are more serious.But, UK policy is to try to extend the epidemic and flatten the peak, so that whilst the chance of being infected may remain high the ‘when’ extends over a longer period allowing healthcare resources to better manage the seriously ill, and minimising economic damage.At present the chances of being infected in London are minuscule, if as predicted the virus spreads your chances of being infected in London will rise, but they’ll be rising at home too. If the UK strategy to suppress the peak of the outbreak and extend its duration by slowing the spread is successful then you chance of being infected in London may be lower than at home, but last for longer. If the UK approach doesn’t work it will be the same the world over.All of which adds up to you might as well travel now, because nobody knows what the position will be in a month or two (there are some forecasts suggesting a peak in late May, but projecting forward small numbers into the future is always hard hence the 40 - 70% range above).Anyone who thinks it’s just like seasonal ‘flu is daft, the virus is more infectious and more deadly, but predicting individual outcomes is equally daft, all you can do is look at the statistics, listen to the advice (and bear in mind the politics and what’s not said, as well as how what is said is phrased). After that it’s a game of chance, rigorous personal hygiene routines may prevent infections, but over a period of three or four months are unlikely to prove 100% effective.So, don’t panic, take reasonable sensible precautions, but anticipate that you or a member of your close family will probably get a mild infection, and be very careful not to infect the elderly where the mortality risk is much much higher."
"There is no way I would visit London at the moment. Most cities are a risk but London is a special case. The government is considering suspending parliament for three months, so what do they know? Last week everything was fine, don't worry, it is all in hand. Then they had an emergency meeting on Monday and they obviously had some very unwelcome news from experts. Last week the number of cases in the UK was in single figures, now it is in three figures and has doubled in two days."
"@18“ The government is considering suspending parliament for three months, so what do they know?”Old news. They scrapped that idea.The point is that it takes 7 to 14 days from infection to symptoms and people are infectious before symptoms appear. Roughly each infected person infects 2.3 others. So what you are looking at with the current cases is the position maybe 10 days ago, you could expect the numbers to roughly double every day from now on. But there’s only 25 cases in London so that’s not a great worry, it’s a trivial proportion of the population. However York is just over 2 hours from London by train (about the time it takes to actually cross London from east to west) hundreds of people make the trip every day and you’d be wildly optimistic if you thought the risk of infection in York, Leeds Bradford etc was much lower maybe somewhere remote you’d be fine, but major population centres? No chance."

"Ummmm….yeah, time to review your post :("
"I know many people on TALF are real Museum of London fans. I heard yesterday that they are looking to start curating some of the ephemera of the epidemic now, for future exhibitions - this thread and several others from March would be good ones to capture..."
"22 of 23 ·Ummmm….yeah, time to review your post :You mean the post that said they were planning to come over a month ago, although interesting how quickly this has escalated I don't think we need this post resurrected"
