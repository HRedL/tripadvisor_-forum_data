"We have just been scammed by a beauty treatment centre near Bugis Markets. My husband and I were walking through the markets and were approached and told we could have a sun spot or skin tag removed for $5. To cut a long story short; we were taken up some stairs and I was in a treatment room where my spot was going to be assessed. At the same time my husband was taken to be assessed and we were told separately that the other had agreed to a treatment for $98, which was completely untrue. Both of us said we wanted to see the other but were told the treatment had started and couldn’t be interrupted. Suffice to say, $178 later, after being asked to sign a form approving the treatment assuming the other had agreed to have (it could have been much worse) we were told the final cost would be over $250 which included some cream that would be required. We were then told we could not eat seafood, go in the sun, exercise or take a steam, which was one of the benefits of staying in Singapore in our nice hotel. We have been scammed and show the scars - literally! Hoping no others will be taken by this one."
It is a shame you were unaware of this salon's unethical tactics as reported complaints concerning Singapore's beauty salon industry have more than doubled in the past 2 years according to CASE ( Consumers association).You could pay your $26 membership fee and lay a complaint against them as they report an 80% success rate in obtaining a satisfactory resolution/ refund.Sadly in todays modern age it is always prudent to perform a due diligence whenever parting with money in such circumstances as many people are so intent on lightening your pocket by any means.
"Oh gosh. Cheap Sunspot removal services by someone approaching you in a market. I certainly wouldn’t have gone with them and would have been polite but firmly said no thank you and kept walking. If they persisted I would have raised my voice a bit and told them to go away.I think it’s a timely reminder for tourists travelling anywhere in the world not to take up any offers, or go off with people who approach you on the street, or in markets or any public place. Best to keep your wits about you, don’t take up offers for skin treatments, or semi-medical procedures, or anything else where you have to detour from what you were doing and go to another place or go in some form of transport with a random stranger.Sun spots, skin tags and any other skin condition should be checked at home with your family Doctor and get their advice. Under Australia’s medical system getting that done probably would have been bulk-billed and cost nothing. I get skin cancer checks, sun spot procedures and have had skin cancer excisions here in Australia. I’d never get anything done while on holiday from a random stranger.You say scars - then I suggest you go to your local Doctor and have them assessed and see what can be done.I’ve never seen anyone offering those kind of services wandering around the streets in Singapore. I urge all tourists to be firm and walk away. Don’t risk your health and your money."
I also agree about reporting this high pressure and misleading conduct. There is a Singapore Tourism Board email address on this link:-https://www.case.org.sg/complaint.aspxCASE Consumer Association - https:/…complaint_onlinecomplaint.aspx
It was definelty our massive error. Never again...and we certainly don’t want any others to be as stupid as us.
"No, not stupid. Maybe just enjoying your holiday, wandering around and a fast-talking person got the better of you and you let your guard down. They sounded very intimidating by not letting you confer with your other half and pushing you to sign a document. I hope you report them to the Singapore Tourism Board. On occasion in Singapore I see people handing out flyers/brochures for discounts on drinks, or meals at certain restaurants, or Foot Reflexology services. I hate things pushed into my hands and try and say no and keep walking. If they are persistent I take the flyer and throw it in the nearest bin. Anything unsolicited, on the street or a public place like a mall, MRT station, is best avoided."
"Oh Gosh! This is really sad.Even i remember when i visited that street, those people were approaching for pedicure and facial in $5. Luckily i had very limited time so refused and said NO.these kind of these by those people are really not go towards tourists. But having said that, We all must aware and not accept such cheap offer whenever we visit any new country.Thanks for sharing your experience here!Regards,www.wanderlustrenu.com"
"People need to use their common sense when on holiday, same as you do at homeIt always amazes me what some people do"
"My mum just got approached by them. And being an almost 70 yo woman and shes kinda gullible too, they were shameless to ripped off almost 1k. Im trying to see how to get back at them and retrieve the money because the money was given by me to saved up for her haj"
Dammit!!! Just got done by the same place. Unfortunately my friend had half her freckles (which she loved) zapped off. I came out to her in tears. They're bloody scumbags. Wish I had seen your post sooner :(
"We also got scammed by this Ruby Beauty Centre. Luring is with cheap sun spot removal, took us to a neat centre, assuring us of pain less execution. But as soon as they started ,I realised it was lazer with no local anaesthesia applied. I said no to treatment and got up. Suddenly the sweet girls converted into violent demons and asked me to pay money as I refused the treatment. I said I was never told it's painful lazer. Tourist in an unknown country on last day of vacation has limited hope of justice in a foreign land. I just wanted to pamper myself with some nice facial treatment not a lazer application. They were violent, we decided to pay and avoid trouble. Sad part is that they even gave us bill. No fear of being reported. People should avoid such luring offers. We got our lesson. Not a very expensive one though. But enough to burn our blood over being cheated.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Maybe the Singapore Tourism Board might be good to contact. They have an online contact form. On this link you can select “Submit a Complaint” menu option and then fill in details of what happened, and give the businesses name and address:- https://www.visitsingapore.com/contact-us/They may have advice."
"It never amazes me that people are quite happy to contemplate having treatment which is offered to them by someone approaching them in the street, I would never do it in my own country let alone in a foreign country, what are you people thinking :("
This happened to me too. I was sold cream I didn’t need for 88$ and have scars. Avoid this place.
It's really interesting how many people are posting on this who haven't posted much (or any) before.
Why is that interesting tally?
"I don't understand why these people are getting away with it with so many of us getting scammed one way or another. I usually don't take any offers but thought $5 to take 1 mark off my face was worth it. Was it stupid yes, in the end they wanted $160 for what they did and at that point I knew that it was a scam and was even told to be quiet and pay. I could have walked out and paid nothing but being in a new country I wasn't sure what they could get up to. Just wanted to get out, they left me in tears and ended up paying $100. They have put a bad taste in my mouth about Singapore and never again."
You can complain to Singapore Tourism Board. I can’t promise you will get your money back but hopefully they will be investigated.https:/…contact-us.html
Thanks so much I will look into it
"I am also scamnmed by this Ruby beauty centre at Bencoolen. The China lady Manager insisted tt i take the facial treatment at $28 even though i profusely refused, ahe then snatch my bag n led me in the room to do the facial. After which the pigmentation spots of $5 each scam begin to kick in. Same the small container of medicine costing $48 charge hve to b bought. In all a promise of $28, in the end we pay close to $200! Hope others be aware."
"I got into the same mess yesterday. Never believe wht the China manager says. Beware, the medicine cost $48 for a small container, totally cheated. A promised of only $28, in the end have to pay close to $120. DO NOT LET THIS BEAUTICIAN AT BENCOOLEN ALLEY TRICK U INTO THIS!"
