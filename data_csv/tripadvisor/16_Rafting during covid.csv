We are planning to be in Durango in mid-July and are interested in rafting. Any recommendations for rafting companies that are taking precautions by reducing the number of people on each raft in addition to other measures? I was going to start calling to ask but figured I’d ask here first. It’s a stretch to get my husband on the water period so I think trying to convince him to do kayaks instead (which I feel would be safer in terms of covid) might be a losing battle. Thanks in advance for any feedback/recommendations!

Hi Jessica. You might also ask about transportation to and from the put in. Normally you're on a bus/van with a bunch of people. Personally I would only go with an outfitter that a mandatory requirement to mask up on the bus. I'd not worry so much about being on the raft with others.
"Not too impressed with M2W COVID policy but glad that they give it up front. State regs are groups of 10 and they are proposing up to 25. State guidance is no more than two households on a boat, no such commitment on their website. Laplata County may have a variance from the state to allow that so you will have to make up your own mind."
"I was not recommending Mild To Wild, merely giving you the link for their COVID-19 response. Similarly, here are the COVID-19 responses for Durango Rivertrippers and Mountain Waters.https:/…https://durangorafting.com/covid-19If you have specific questions about any COVID-19 policies, I would call the company you are considering."
Your inflatable kayak idea could be fun. Maybe with some instruction at the start and a float section he might enjoy it. I have been with many first timers and most really get into it.
