Just this minute watching the report on Sky News absolutely shocking FFM !Angie.
There are times when this feels like it's not real...then you see something like that.
Saw that on the news last night. Shocking was the word in my mind as well.
Awful. I read recently that they were considering burying people (temporarily) in graves in public parks. Lack of space for such a sudden demand in a very highly populated area.
"FFM,No, not in most developed Western countries, at least.So very sad.Hunt"
"We’ve visited some very old cemeteries, and noticed graves, with perhaps 12 family members buried within a month or so, during times of epidemics. Always so very, very sad.This takes it to a whole new level of sadness.Hunt"
"In my lifetime I've never experienced this. It's a strange time and perhaps in Western worlds this isn't the norm with so many deaths. I feel sad for anyone in these circumstances now and before and in the future. Not being able to say goodbye properly. Let's hope things get better.... Stay home!Edited: 12:39 pm, April 11, 2020 "
“Unclaimed remains ?” Does that mean these are mostly homeless people with no families ? Very sad whatever the case.
"Walker,Or folk with all family elsewhere, perhaps?Hunt"
Shocking and so sad.
Did I expect to see it ? No.But am I shocked by it ? No.We knew there were pandemics in the past and there will be more in the future FAR worse than this.
