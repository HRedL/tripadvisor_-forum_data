"Julian,I read all flights to Noronha will be stopped for 15 days. I would contact the airline, but it seems leisure travel to touristic destinations it's going to be really hard these days. If you can cancel or postpone, much better I think."
"ok thanks Jorge. Checked my reservation on Azul website, at moment it is still good. Also, nothing on airport closure on the official site. but you're right, think i will cancel/postpone. Thanks much !http://www.noronha.pe.gov.br/"
"This is what forum member Rokatoo posted not long ago:""state of Pernambuco has announced that airport at Fernando de Noronha (FEN) will close for regular flights this Saturday (March 21).[as mentioned before, a good part of the island is part of a national park, which is closing for one week][FEN has limited health resources; pregnant women, for example, must move to the mainland for the final months of pregnancy as any eventually needed more complex procedures cannot be performed there]""See post #149 of the thread:https:/…106092649"
thanks Jorget
"Julian,it is as Jorge mentioned...google translate article:https://g1.globo.com/pe/pernambuco/blog/vive…[embedded video explains that only island residents and certain health etc personnel etc will be allowed in the island]dont know where you are right now, but if possible, best thing is to cancel trip to any part of Brazil.... if already in Brazil, personally, I would try to get to major airport and arrange flights to your home country ASAP, as many flights being canceled, so that you do not get stranded in Brazil.if already in Brazil, check status of your flight reservation home; e,g, American Airlines has already canceled all flights to/from Brazil.[airline websites are not being able to keep up with scores of cancellations etc, so info may not be updated]ever more stringent measures restricting travel etc being adopted thruout Brazil; situation changes by the hour; follow this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30350…"
"Julian, it's not paranoia. People are dying in significant numbers."
"Yes, the toll number is 6 now in Brazil (a few days ago no dead were reported, so we see a huge increment in very little time)"
