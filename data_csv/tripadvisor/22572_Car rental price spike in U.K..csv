We rent a car every May in the U.K. We went to rent for pickup at either LHR or Cardiff city and the prices for a month this May are almost double from last May. Does anyone know why?
"Holiday weekend this year and not last? That's the most likely explanation as pricing is, in effect, market driven."
Good spot becasse the public holiday in early May has shifted back a weekend so as to match VE Day - OP what are your dates?
Also possibly that people are avoiding public transport because of coronavirus?
"Don’t think so as the pickup date is April 29 and we’ve done that date before, but maybe. And the rental is for a month. Thanks!"
"Hmm, maybe, but we started checking a month ago before this virus got bad and the price was just as high then."
"Can't find any holidays or reason.Perhaps it's a drop in tourist numbers and their 'wise' decision is just to charge more.It is possible that people are avoiding public transport or maybe it's so many people staying at home rather than flying abroad. It would be cheaper and more convenient to drive a family perhaps than go by train. Or they hope this is what will happenI'd wait and see if the price drops. Interesting twist thoughEdited: 2:10 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Yes, we will wait. Thanks."
"Obviously, I can’t speak for every car rental company, but the common practice is to lease cars from the manufacturers and then rent them out for a certain number of miles while agreeing to maintain them and then the cars get sold off. Perhaps a potential travel slow down has caused them to cut back on their car inventory."
That is probably the best answer. They saw this coming. Supply and demand.
