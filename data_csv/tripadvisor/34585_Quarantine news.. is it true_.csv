Kyodo is a large news agent in Japan and I would trust this source.
"Kyodo is a reputable news media, and I have no reason to doubt what the article reports."
This is actually good news. Japan is finally getting serious about protecting its people.
Dave based on your link only suspected one will be quarantine.. i didnt see the link stating everyone on the flight will be quarantine.?
"Btw, does the link i provide mention if a person suspected to be infected then everybody on the plane need to be quarantine too?"

I am unable to access any of these articles. Can someone please explain what flight/ quarantine this is referencing? Thank you!
Use google translate:　加藤勝信厚生労働相は13日、新型コロナウイルスによる肺炎の患者や感染が疑われる人に検疫法上の「隔離」や「停留」といった措置を取れるようにする方針を明らかにした。14日に政令を施行する。　いずれも感染症の国内流入を防ぐために感染症法や検疫法で定められた措置で、入国前に実施する。隔離は空港や港で危険な感染症の感染が疑われる人が見つかり、検査で陽性となった場合、そのまま医療機関に入院させる。停留は、飛行機や船舶に1人でも明らかな感染者がいたら、乗客全員を入国させずに検査結果が出るまで医療機関にとどまってもらう。
">>Btw, does the link i provide mention if a person suspected to be infected then everybody on the plane need to be quarantine too?<<Yes, it does."
"To: Dr Shibuyakko (#9) - Google translates your post to:Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare, Katsunobu Kato, announced on May 13 that it will take measures such as ""quarantine"" and ""suspension"" under the Quarantine Law for patients with pneumonia and suspected infections caused by the new coronavirus. The ordinance will be enforced on the 14th.Each of these measures should be carried out before entry into Japan, as prescribed by the Infectious Diseases Law and the Quarantine Law to prevent the influx of infectious diseases into Japan. Isolation involves finding a person suspected of having a dangerous infection at an airport or port, and if the test is positive, directs the patient to a medical institution. If there is any apparent infection on an airplane or ship, stop the passengers and stay at the medical facility until a test result is obtained.I assuming that it actually meant the 13th DAY, as in FEBRUARY 13, 2020 and not MAY 13th in the Google translation."
Thanks any other news about this new ordinance? I didnt see any airlines giving out such notice yet. If anyone has can please share. This is rather worrying..
"Have just cancelled my flight to Tokyo (tomorrow) and all hotel/ski bookings.As this was announced yesterday (less than 24 hours ago), it might take some time for airlines to respond.https:/…2020021301001165.html"
We are flying 22 feb.... no cancel and refund yet from airline.. the news is Confirm valid ?
"What confirmation do you need ? It was announced by the Health Minister yesterday.Maybe the Japan Embassy in Malaysia is in a position to confirm the new executive order effective from today, if that's what you want.>>１４日に政令を施行する。隔離は空港や港で危険な感染症の感染が疑われる人が見つかり、検査で陽性となった場合、そのまま医療機関に入院させる。停留は、飛行機や船舶に１人でも明らかな感染者がいたら、乗客全員を入国させずに検査結果が出るまで医療機関にとどまってもらう。<<"
I didnt see it in news like bbc/cnn yet.. so far only only japan link news
The news is coming from Japan not England or the USA. The statement is announced by Japanese Health Minister. You don't need a confirmation from BBC/CNN. They'll just translate whatever they get from Japan.
Yes i am reading news about others info but not this particular quarantine ordiance from feb14. Usually news like that pick up pretty fast. So just wondering..hope to ger more info later today..
Why don't you just call Japanese embassy in your country? They can give you the most reliable and accurate info.
"Thanks i emailed the embassy havent heard back yet. In another forum, someone just landed in tokyo today and wasnt ask to do any check... just like normal. Hopefully to hear more info this weekend."
Health minister Kato-san’s public transcripts on the topic of the virus can all be seen here: https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/kaiken/index.htmlNo mention to the info on the link i shared here at this moment. Will be watching this closely for feb 13 news
"With everything going on, you might be able to cancel. Call the airline and ask.>>>We are flying 22 feb.... no cancel and refund yet from airline.. the news is Confirm valid?The policy is going to reduce international travel to Japan to very, very low numbers. Most casual visitors won't want to take the risk of a potential 2-week quarantine."
"the statement from health minister on feb 13...didnt even mentioned the link information to quarantined everyone at allhttps://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/kaiken/index.htmlthey just updated yesterday statements from him 1 about the cruise, 1 more about the new cases.airlines has said at the moment can verifty as well so no cancellation at this moment. Cancellation is to China, Taiwan, HK, and Macau :("
"Hi Ling, I believe we are booked on the same flight. I have been asking the airlines whether we can defer/change dates too. They have given the same response over & over again.Do you plan to go ahead if there is no refund/change allowed?"
Can change but depends on ticket price and change fees. I am trying verify seems that not everyone will be quarantined. Hopefully more news will be out this weekend. Health minister did say checks will now be for every suspected case and not only China. We are flying Hokkaido. Are you flying tokyo or hokkaido?
I'm flying to Tokyo
"It's indeed a bit under the radar. I think the policy is official but it doesn't seem well publicized. Also, in practical terms, it might not be so easy to enforce."
I guess they made the rule just in case.
Yeah I wish there was an official announcement. This is what worries me the most. I'm generally a healthy adult with good hygiene but I fear being unlucky and being on a plane with someone displaying symptoms (even if it's just a common cold) and then being quarantined for days.But how could they enforce it?
"I fly on March 1st to Tokyo and have been thinking about this news a lot - as many of you also feel, this is the only real worry about going. However, since this announcement there have been no examples of it being used. There are thousands of people arriving in Japan every day, and it is impossible that zero passengers so far have had any cold/flu symptoms (in February!). I would guess that this legislation has been passed to make it legal and establish processes *if* it is absolutely necessary, not set as a standard procedure should there be any colds on board. Diamond Princess has been a real logistical nightmare for Japan, I can imagine that they will be trying to avoid quarantining hundreds of tourists wherever possible."
"Thanks, sapporo just had another case today noon. Waiting for more info online from the Mayor on the details. The man was from the city apparently no link to China."
"But I believe many Chinese are visitng Sapporo. Actually two were found in Hokkaido today.Edited: 3:37 am, February 19, 2020 "
yes 1 more just came in earlier today..just read it..i think i will skip sapporo city this time..just spend more time in the ski resort..
