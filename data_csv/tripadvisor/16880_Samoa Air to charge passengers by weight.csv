"Unless this is a late April Fools Joke.Someone's finally taken the plunge and done it!http://www.samoaair.ws/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22001256""Samoa Air, Introducing a world first: 'Pay only for what you weigh'!We at Samoa Air are keeping airfares fair, by charging our passengers only for what they weigh. You are the master of your Air'fair', you decide how much (or little) your ticket will cost. No more exorbitant excess baggage fees, or being charged for baggage you may not carry. Your weight plus your baggage items, is what you pay for. Simple.""Edited: 7 years ago "
I thought this was introduced at the end of last year....tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k59687â€¦
So it was. Looks like the mainstream press is a bit late on the pick up.
"Well would not be the first time though,,,:))Am actually surprised they are doing it. I can't see it going down well here."
How can you buy a ticket online??????????
"""Am actually surprised they are doing it""they are a tiny local airline transporting a population with an chronic obesity problem wont have any impact anywhere else in the world"
"No, I mean if say a European or us airline did it,,,and lets be honest, some chronic obesity in eu and the states...:))"
"I personally think it is a very good idea. Hopefully other airlines will follow suit. It's about time.I'm still seething about the time Qatar Air charged me $160 for an overweight bag at Nairobi when the family behind me (all of them!) easily weighed triple their baggage allowance. If you're carrying it, it should be considered baggage!"
Makes sense for this airline. Samoa Air operates small planes (Britten Norman (BN2A) and Cessna 172's). Both aircraft have weight limitations far lower than the aircraft most people on this site are used to flying.
Heard the CEO talking on the radio yesterday. You have to be honest about your weight when you book on line. i guess they may still weigh you and your luggage at the airport and charge you more if necesssary.The price charged is per KG of pax and luggage combined. I have been weighed many times by small Pacific based airlines (including Qantas LinK when flying to Lord Howe). Its not that unusual here. What is new is charging passengers by weight.And Froggy while there may be an obesity epidemic in Europe it has not had the devastating effect of causing more than half of the adults to develop diabetes as has happened in Samoa.Edited: 7 years ago 
I hear the diabetes epidemic is also spreading in the middle East...
"if that is TRUE (which I doubt), interesting, because pacific islanders are among the heaviest people in the world."
"It is very true, the news is all over the net."
"Many passengers are families traveling from one island to another to visit family and friends rather than business people or tourists. This airline is more a commuter service than the sort of airline we may be familiar with. Charging per kg is much cheaper for families than having to pay half or even full fare for their children. It seems emminently fair to me. Why should my luggage and I pay the same as someone who weighs in 100kg heavier than me? And then I get charged overweight because my bag weighs 21 kg instead of 20kg? How is that fair or equitable? The cost to an airline is based on weight whether it travels in the hold, the overhead lockers or the seats.Edited: 7 years ago "
It most certainly IS true karen. As i said I heard a long interview with the CEO on our public broadcast radio last night. And as I said weighing passengers on Pacific island airlines is nothing new. Has been happening for decades.
I just saw this on our local TV news.Is it a way of the future with our population getting heavier as time goes by. Perhaps.Tommo
"This is a non story. What (even the BBC this morning) fail to mention is that they operate one Cessna 172 with capacity for three pax plus pilot (a plane I have flown in many many times) which has a very limited load capacity and BN-2's which have a max loading or around 1250 kg including fuel, crew and pax so obvioulsy they need to be really careful about not overloading or the damn thing just wont get off the ground especially in hot air conditions.Most people in the world will never have flown on anything smaller than a B737 so can't really comprehend the fact that overloadong a plane means it might crash and burn so just listen to this news about weighing pax and relate it to thier next flight on Ryaneasyjet.as said also Samoa has an obesity issue."
"Eva--hold bags are counted as cargo pounds. Carry-ons are included in pax average weight formula. Once carry-ons are gate-checked, they become cargo weight and can be a factor in weight and balance on some aircraft. Pax can be off-loaded or denied boarding if the cargo weight is excessive--a flight can go out w/empty seats in that case. I've only seen it a few times, hubby has seen it more frequently in his 26 yrs as a pilot."
"Lol, love ronaldos post, he is right, Wikipedia has them at a fleet size of two. It's a non story:))"
"Yes, kyshel I know all that. But fuel load is calculated based on total weight of the aircraft - whether it's in the hold or in the seats. On a 737 there's a lot more wriggle room than on a Cessna - especially if the 3 Cessna passengers are large Samoans - then there's practically no wriggle room ;-)Anyhow, I was just making a general statement about the fairness of ticketing when we get charged huge amounts for being just a pound overweight in our luggage but we can be 50 lbs overweight and get charged nothing extra. As froggy says, - non story It's a tiny airline with a couple of 3 seater aircraft - 6 pax and they are at 100% capacity! It's also an old story. It must have been a slow news day on the aviation desk."
"Eva--I love your ""wiggle room""comment. When carry bags are moved to gate check and put in the hold, it will count as part of the pax formula AND cargo. It will be added to cargo weight (x amount per bag). When all of the last boarding zone has to gatecheck due to limited bin space, that bag weight is not subtracted from the cabin pax weight formula. That remains static. I'm not talking about small aircraft like Samoan air. I am referring to major aircraft, MDs, Airbus, Boeing, etc. Most RJ's have a set weight allowance because they require gate check for carry-ons due to small bin size.Edited: 7 years ago "
"We're already paying. Airlines using more fuel due to heavier passengers. Everyone pays, heavy or not. Some people are obese through little fault of their own, though even those who can control their own weight often claim no fault in being overweight (sorry, ""plus sized""). Our health insurance costs are also skyrocketing."
"Sutter writes ""Our health insurance costs are also skyrocketing.""Do you mean ours, as in Brazil?We do know that some of these Samoan lads are heavier don't we?Of course, I don't suppose anybody gets a discount because they're lighter, unless they sit in somebody else's lap or bassinet.The Mainstream Media, Administration Press, etc is always behind the times or simply blabbing non-truths. And then they have the gall to criticize and threaten non-mainstream media, for hurting the effect of reporting garbage. Pravda has actually gotten pretty good.Have you noticed that Spirit Airlines charges for carry-on bags?Edited: 7 years ago "
"Like helicopters, these tiny planes have to know exact load weights."
