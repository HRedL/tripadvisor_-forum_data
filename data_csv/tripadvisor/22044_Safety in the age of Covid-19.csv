"Hi, Hoping for a trip to Murphy, NC in the next few weeks, but as we are in a high risk group, was wondering about safety in the area. Will be staying at the casino but like to eat at the local restaurants, and was wondering about the precautions taken, general attitude of the populace in regards to the pandemic and such. Any information is appreciated."
"Hi Howard, and welcome to this forum.I came THROUGH Cherokee last weekend but we didn't stop anywhere, heading home from Gatlinburg. Hopefully someone can give you specific info to Cherokee/Murphy, but in lieu of specific info, I will give you the best GENERAL consensus I can across the State. We were in Bryson City/Murphy in March (before it was a big thing), Atlantic Beach/Swansboro/Beaufort/Morehead City the last week in June. and Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge/Sevierville/Townsend last weekend (while not NC-they did pass a mask mandate in their county.)I'm seeing our board flooded with this question under several city sub forums, but I think the best answer for ALL is ""it depends"". In ALL areas I've been in, I see A RANGE of mindsets. Some businesses are very stringent in their enforcement and trying their best to comply with the Executive Order. I have seen a couple of restaurants where folks were initially allowed in by a hostess but stopped by a manager or owner and made to comply. Most places are posting the required signage, and asking for compliance, and getting same from the vast majority of customers, but aren't going to make a scene or lose a customer for non-compliance. Some-a very few-look as if they aren't enforcing this at all. Most restaurants are requiring you to wear it to your table then it comes off. Some customers will be considerate and wear it back out, but some don't.I myself haven't felt overly concerned at any one place YET, but I'm reasonably healthy, practice hand hygiene, and wear my mask (yes I know the mask is for OTHERS). I do NOT get in large crowds (retired LE officer-I just have no interest in any activity that requires me to be in that environment) and I work a part time retirement job in a healthcare facility anyway.DEPENDING on what you do on your trip, the casino you'll be staying at is likely your biggest risk(?)FYI look at Rib Country for a meal..."
"We just did a 10 day vacation in the area and it was awesome...wide open spaces and small quiet town. The people are Covid conscious but it's just not so ""hot"" there. It was SO refreshing!! I highly recommend grabbing some circle tubes from Walmart and renting a boat on a nearby lake and spend the day boating and floating / fishing...breathtaking and Covid stress-free!!"
