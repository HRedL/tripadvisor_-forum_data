"Hi I saw the news unfolded today on the current situation with the Coronavirus in Italy. We have already booked our flights and accommodation for our 3 week itinerary 9-27 Apr to Rome, Sorrento/ Positano, Venice, Bologna, Parma, Cinque T, Florence, and Tuscany. We are travelling on our own (not following tours) and have booked a few bike tours in the major cities like Rome and Florence. Advice needed to help us decide to cancel trip or just go with it. Thanks"
"Still too soon to say. At the moment, there are 76 reported infected persons in Italy, nearly all in Lombardy and Veneto. Two elderly patients have died. The government has taken draconian steps to keep the virus isolated, but the effort may not entirely succeed.. So far, there are no reported cases in the tourist cities. This may change in the near future. In any event, the key is to wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your mouth, nose or eyes, stay far away from people coughing or sneezing, and avoid crowded spaces, especially enclosed spaces.If you were to cancel this trip, next year there will probably be a new strain of virus. Keep in mind that the virus becomes ""serious"" (pneumonia) in only 20% of reported cases."
"No one can tell you what to do and September is a bit off in the future. Anything that people think is true now will be totally different in September. I have tickets for April and I am going. I can not control the situation, the Italian Government will do what they do in what they think is best for Italy."
"If you cancel now, you will probably not get any refunds, as there is no government warning against travel to Italy."
"Just in the last two days there has been rapid escalation of cases (and two deaths) in northern Italy -- mostly Lombardy (Milan) and Veneto (which includes Venice, but think only cases in that region have been in or around Padua). Last I read, 80 confirmed cases plus the two deaths. Suspect will go higher before is over. Sounds like Italian government is taking it very seriously, locking down towns, quarantining people, schools closed, Milan closing public offices & some fashion week events canceled. Many Carnaval events canceled all over Italy. I have no idea what to say. If your arrangements are cancellable with little or no penalty, maybe cancel to be on safe side and go later in year."
"You know, one of the issues with stuff like this is not just the possibility of getting sick, but the possibility of getting stuck-- whether sudden quarantine or sudden unavailability of flights, and feeling you have to be constantly monitoring the situation for things like that.In an interview yesterday (Friday I think) Italian PM was asked if Italy would suspend Schengen Accord (free movement of people within Europe). He said they had no immediate plans for that, but were open to any idea that would keep Italians safe. I think they are already putting people with those heat sensors at train stations and airports. Who knows what will be next.A couple weeks ago I canceled a trip to Europe that would have been this week, for reasons totally unrelated to coronavirus. But after I canceled I felt relieved that I wasn't going to have to worry about catching a cold (none this year so far, knock on wood), not to mention coronavirus, whether to wear masks on plane, etc, etc. At a certain point it just becomes such a hassle that travel stops being fun."
"We are scheduled to go mid March. My husband and I are traveling with our two grandkids, ages 11 and 14. We are monitoring the situation. I don’t want any of us to get the virus, and I also don’t want to be under quarantine and unable to go home. Our flights from the US are in and out of London, with a BA flight into Venice and out of Rome. At this time, we are considering skipping Italy and staying in the UK."
"We will have a much better ""read"" on the situation within the next week. If contagion spreads to the tourist cities in significant numbers, or even to other non-tourist larger towns, there will be a re-assessment. So far, the situation has not affected any of the tourist destinations, but this is just the second day after the big news story broke.If you read Italian, you can follow developments in real time on the major internet news sites such as www.repubblica.it and www.corriere.itEdited: 8:31 pm, February 22, 2020 "

"My greatest concern with the original post is sheer fatigue rushing about like that. You also will be spending a lot of in crowded places. Not enough time relaxing. We have bookings for September-November in Italy. We may or may not need to cancel, but this is too soon to know. The best science does not know the course of COVID-19, whether it becomes like the flu. The situation is not helped by the mediademic. A doctor friend reminded yesterday that globally 5000 people are killed by influenza every week, !0,000 in the US so far this northern winter. The flu season is winding down in Italy, but there will probably be new fluvax available in Australia in March. No, it won't work against whatever else but if you don't get knocked by the flu you won't have a weakened immune system.My Australian travel insurance, where we took out cover before 22 January, COVIS-19 day, says refund if SmartTraveller says don't go, no refund if just fear.So be very watchful. If necessary to cancel with loss, do that closer to time.As regards health in Italy, be conscious that Italy is a member of the G7 (whereas Australia a lesser economy member of the G20), a country with highly developed health, medical and drug industries, oldest medical schools on the planet... and it evident in their radical moves against these new casesthat they are well prepared.Edited: 9:07 pm, February 22, 2020 "

We are supposed to be in Venice April 2 then down to Rome. My husband is a transplant recipient and therefore on immunosuppressants. I’m seriously nervous about coming now. Not so much the risk of catching it but the risk of being stranded or quarantined without his medication. I will see what the next week brings.
"I have been watching the news to given I have a flight for Venice from Los Angeles via Paris scheduled in a week. Although I have trip insurance, I don’t have Cancel for Any Reason trip insurance given I bought my airline tickets in late November before the whole coronavirus situation. I will lose about $1500 Delta award tickets, Ryan Air and EasyJet tickets etc from Venice and to and from around Italy. I read there is a travel ban for a few northern towns but article doesn’t say which cities except towns near Milan; I don’t think this includes Venice. I had planned to visit Venice and the Prosecco region just about an hour away from Venice. Can anyone confirm about the travel bans?Edited: 10:00 pm, February 22, 2020 "

"#13 If you have Delta award tickets and cancel, you can have the miles used for the tix redeposited to your Delta Skymiles account.

"Thanks for the info. I just looked at my trip insurance and I had to had purchase cancel for any reason within 14 days of my initial deposit. I have a Delta award ticket and a United one back via Belgium and my friend has a RT Delta so I guess we can pay the cancellation fees if we indeed cancel which is more likely than not. I just checked the United cancellation fee which is $125. Ryan Air and EasyJet has change fees of roughly $50; we have several Inter-Italy ones and I have a flight from Rome to Belgium. As excited as we were to see Venice and Italy it’s very scary plus both my friend and I have elderly sickly parents who we care for (I take my mom to dialysis regularly and her medical appointments including right when I get back) and my friend has kids. It’s so scary, and we can’t afford to be quarantined.Edited: 11:37 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"The US State Dept issued an advisory yesterday regarding cruising in Asia, suggesting people think twice about it because of risks of quarantine, etc AND fact that State Dept not likely to continue chartering planes to go in and pluck people out. I think that warning about not continuing to rely on State Dept to get you home is something one might assume applies to Americans traveling anywhere these days, so good to think about your responsibilities at home before you venture out there. Good luck."
"Samantha that’s a very difficult situation. Yours too DL. I too have mediocre health and medicine to take. The most dIfficult new element in recent days is discovery that people with no symptoms and apparently tested negative have traveled and been the source of new clusters of infection. So it’s very difficult to say not at X. Also difficult to anticipate where locations could be closed or flights may be stopped. Amid political and social anxiety. I think best wait and watch, review insurance, remember that if money is eventually lost it’s only money and we would spend much more if we travel.... ... and be pleased not to own an airline or be a car dealer in China where sales have dropped 90% this month.Italian Health Ministry page.

"Hey people, what is needed is medical advice, not opinions from other travelers! And there isn't enough information available yet to make a decision based on scientific or medical advice.Edited: 12:34 am, February 23, 2020 "
Cruises are high risk because you're all confined in a restricted space.Ask yourself what sort of trip are you planning? Even without the virus people have been getting ill on cruises for years. The reason things like this happen during the winter is people tend to be cooped up inside next to other people. April or later you're not likely to be huddling indoors elbow to elbow with someone who is coughing in your direction. Not saying the current situation isn't serious but just think about what usually happens with the flu. Kids bring it back from school. Parents and other family members get sick and spread it to others they know. The virus is similar but more contagious. No matter how contagious it still requires you to be around someone who is sick.
"we are flying from Heathrow to Venice next Monday, at the moment. At the moment i have no problem with that, insurance is a problem anyway, if there is no official reason not to travel you cant claim. so i will keep an eye out for info, the reaction to this virus.in my opinion. is ridiculous. normal flu kills about 600 a year in uk and in 2008/9 estimated at 13000."
Tony S talks sense. Do not rely on media and heresay . Wait and see what the officials say what is genuine and not hyped up and twisted by journalists.

Very helpful. thank you
"At the moment, the only closures which affect tourism are MUSEUMS IN THE LOMBARDY REGION (which includes Milan), LA SCALA OPERA HOUSE in Milan, and CARNEVALE festival in Venice.The 10 towns in southern Lombardy and 1 town in Veneto subject to quarantine are NOT tourist destinations.For those interested, here is the webpage of La Repubblica with real time information:https:/…"
"tony s, you beat me to the punch. some people are ridiculous."
"There is almost no health danger for anyone under 60 who has no preexisting health problem. But there is a strong probability that the mass hysteria and crazy governmental restrictions that follows this relatively mild illness will be enough to ruin ones travel, whether China Italy or anywhere else."
Following...we're scheduled to visit in late March. Wishing everyone good health
"Best medical opinion is that answers will not come quickly enough and control measures must be rigorous to avoid pandemic. Read the WHO site, China Daily, etc. As for #28, born 1947, he and I both know not only that this virus hits the older harder, we know also that most people who are older fall off the perch sooner. But from one statistic you cannot proceed to such unfounded generalisation. There may be hysteria, I don’t use social media and I don’t read Murdoch or Daily Mail. I do follow the efforts of serious governmental organisations to rein this thing in. Ordinary travelers will be caught up in the restraints on travel. Medical answers later. The restraints applying in Italy nowhttps://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_febbraio…are being extended to increasing numbers of communities, follow on the main page of Corriere della Serahttps://www.corriere.it/Chrome browser will offer translation."
"DennisA - Thank you for the Corriere della Sera link, following"
"Yes, thank you DennisA for the link. Following this thread as we are scheduled to leave for Rome on 3/7. We are connecting in London and will likely stay there if Rome experiences an outbreak."
"Dennis, I wouldn't be relying on the Australian Govt, nor the Chief Medical Officer for advice regarding the virus."
"Thought this might be helpful. I’ve been looking at the link Dennis A posted and I found this link to the Italian Ministry of Health official page on travel into Italian airportssalute.gov.it/portale/…I ran the first sentence about checks on passengers at airports through Google Translate.“As of February 5, body temperature checks were extended to all passengers on European and international flights arriving at Italian airports.”So looks like allowing a bit more time might be a good idea."
"All these comments about seasonal flu are just silly. The death rate is a fraction of 1% compared to an apparent death rate of 2 or 3 percent with Corona. And of course flu shots tend to lessen the impact of fly -- most people who get seriously ill and die have no had the vaccination.Corona is an unknown but if it gets loose i the population we are talking about millions of deaths not thousands. It is loose in Italy which means that it will spread throughout western Europe -- the only question is when and how fast. It is also almost sure to sweep the US -- the CDC has already said this -- the only issue is how long it can be delayed.And temperature checks at airports are just 'virus theater' as we already know this has been spread by people showing no symptoms. A plane could unload dozens of infected people into a city with no signs at all of illness -- yet.Edited: 2:47 am, February 24, 2020 "
Actually the other way around. The flu has a higher death rate. Perversely that's one of the problems with the new virus. So many people get only mildly sick and they infect a large number of people. The new virus has a low death rate but a fairly high contagion risk.
"The death rate for the common flu is lower than for Coronavirus precisely because there is vaccination available for the common flu and not for Coronavirus. Once a vaccine is developed, the death rate for Coronavirus will probably be similar to that for the common flu.In the meantime, bear in mind that only about 15% of Coronavirus cases are considered ""serious"" (pneumonia), and about 5% ""grave"".Italian authorities have not yet determined precisely HOW this latest outbreak of virus in northern Italy originated. Investigations continue in this regard.Edited: 12:22 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Reading up on the virus and the situation in Italy, I would urge tourists to consider that tourists who decide to go ahead with their travel plans are very likely to turn into the riskiest companions you can have while touring Italy. They will not be taking most if any of the precautions most Italians are taking: they will be in restaurants, on public transports, packing into sites like the Sistine Chapel (if the authorities don't close it).Essentially you are volunteering to associate with people engaging in the riskiest behaviors during this period of uncertainty -- and be aware most tourists to Italy execute far flung itineraries that whiz them from end of Italy to another, using high speed trains. The fact that your trip will only included Rome --- which has no general outbreak at the moment -- ignores that most everyone crowded around you at the Trevi fountain, or at the Roman market, or at Termini station, has just been touring Venice or Milan with other tourists from other places and airports, where they may have become infected."
"Media reports that the Duomo (Cathedral) of Milan will be closed until at least February 25, as a precaution. All museums in the Lombardy Region (including Milan) will be closed, as is La Scala Opera House."
"We are scheduled to leave for Rome 3/12/20. We are scheduled to go south from there to Sorrento, Naples, and Pompeii. We are flying direct from Atlanta and are going with Globus on a tour. I would hope they would keep us up to date. I will be watching this closely."
"I have also booked a flight and hotels for April / May and will be visiting some of the areas with a coronavirus alert (Veneto, Umbria, Lombardia). I think it's too soon to do anything, let's hope the draconian measures the Italian government is taking to contain the virus will succeed. At any rate, the fall in Chinese tourism will make this a quite unusual tourist season around the world, not less in Italy where the impact is already being felt."
Plugging in as visiting Venice end of March...
I am supposed to be flying out on Thursday? If anyone else is also flying out this week - what are you planning on doing? I will be following the news but at the moment it looks like museums/gathering in public places will be banned. If I don’t go I will probably loose my money.
"I have a long planned six week trip flying into Bologna mid-April. Watching closely and will make a decision in a couple weeks - depending. My personal factors for consideration: 65 yrs, have had pneumonia twice in life, second time just last year, traveling solo, do have travel insurance.I'm concerned that now it seems non-symptomatic people are contagious and the incubation period longer than the previously mentioned 14 days. Also concerned that doctors and nurses in hospitals are being infected when these are the people most expected to be practicing all preventative measures.Biggest concern and more likely is getting stuck in an indefinite quarantine situation and not being able to travel once there, having sites closed unexpectedly, or not being able to get home to care for home and pets.I feel so sorry for everyone more immediately and severely affected by this virus. Very difficult decisions have to be made by everyone."
"Cruiser8160,I would be very proactive in communication with Globus regarding your tour. Read the terms and conditions of your contract with them to understand their obligations to you."
"The Coronavirus has NOT NOT yet been reported ANYWHERE south of the Apennine Range (with the exception of the two Chinese tourists and one Italian in Rome, infected in January, all of whom are recovering or have recovered). That means ZERO cases in Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Campania, and further south.Of course, the situation could change at any moment. The biggest disruption for tourists is that museums and churches will be closed in Lombardy and churches closed in Veneto for the time being. The closures may extend to other areas and may be widened. Bars, pubs, discos and ""any other place of public gathering for entertainment"" will be closed in Lombardy from 18:00 to 6:00."
"We are also traveling to Italy this April and for now are still planning to go. Will take precautions and wash hands frequently, monitor the news, avoid the worst places. We all have to enjoy life and not live in fear. Obviously take precautions when you can. If it becomes a pandemic, even staying home will not keep you safe."
"Re #44 on the issue of hospital workers allegedly not taking preventive measures, note I believe this may have happened because the person they were treating, and who is at the heart of this, is a young 38 year old guy with no readily apparent China travel or ties. When his pneumonia failed to respond to normal pneumonia treatment, they did the further testing and found out. I'm sure they are taking required measures now -- their failure to do it initially sickened 5 of them and 3 other hospital patients! By the way, that 38 yr old guy is now in the hospital in critical condition, as is his pregnant wife."

I have found subtleties are often lost in Google-type translations, if they are translated all. My goal was not to one up the wonderful news and color coded maps and charts provided by Italy's leading dailies,not to mention interpretations thereof coming from Australia, but to make sure English speaking people had a chance of understanding what might happen to their travel plans if someone in their cute little Italian hotel, or their cute little airbnb's building, is diagnosed with this virus."

"#52 Austria borders Italy, so I imagine a fair amount of trains cross the border to get to various points in Italy. But they don't travel throughout Italy. At some point people have to switch to Italian trains.I wouldn't be surprised to see some similar restrictions on Italian trains until this is under control. Or maybe just the government encouraging people to have business meetings by video conference, instead of taking the train to Florence or Milan or Rome or wherever, just trying to get people to stay where they are."
I booked a trip to Venice yesterday before the news broke. I planned to sort out my insurance today and now I’m concerned that if I am unable to travel due to Venice being put into shut down they won’t pay out as I knew about the possibility of it happening before booking my insurance. Does anyone know if this is the case or if I can buy insurance and rest assured that I will be covered if they do not allow us to fly?? We are going April 2nd.
"I think the news broke Friday, depending on what news outlet you do or don't follow. That's when I learned about it. I would not expect insurance to cover anything related to this, but I am not expert on UK insurance. Can you cancel the trip or reschedule for later in the year?"
"I don’t know about the insurance. We are traveling from the US to London on March 8. From London, we have booked BA tickets to Venice and back to London from Rome. We spoke to an agent from BA, and he said they will have instructions in 24-48 hours regarding refunds/credits/rebooking because of the Coronavirus outbreak in Italy."
"Qq2, I eventually found your NYT link, and place it for you herehttps:/…china-coronavirus.htmlBe assured I am reading Corriere also in Italian. The google translation is pretty good.  If people want to check on particular places, in addition to Corriere news they could google ‘virus (name of place). As regards #56, this is Austrian trains offerings in Italyhttps:/…italien"
"Re #59 Out of curiosity, I checked the advisories (on the apps, not the websites) of the three major US carriers to Italy -- United, Delta & American -- and did not see anything about rebookings or refunds on travel to Italy, though they all still have their notices about travel to China and other parts of Asia. So they probably also need a day or two to sort out their plans."

It’s all non refundable and changing the dates for the flights cost the same amount as I paid for the flights. I think I just need to hope it’s contained or I will lose all my money.
Im due to visit Venice in a few weeks. As with the majority if we cancel without a travel ban imposed we will loose our money. With this in mind we are still going to travel but wanted to know what others are planning on doing differently if anything at all? I wouldn't normally take Hand Gel to Europe but will do on this visit. Are you planning on buying masks maybe gloves? Are you going to avoid certain areas/ places? Im just trying to get a feel if what precautions everyone is taking?
"I have a planned trip on March 20 with Iberia but I will wait until one week before the trip to make a decision. If there is a travel ban I can change my itinerary and hopefully get a refund...I am very stressed about it but in the and there’s nothing we can do but wait! We are in a privileged position to choose what we will do while others are stuck without no option at all.Edited: 5:35 pm, February 23, 2020 "

"My suggestion is to cancel the trip. Now italy has been noted as one of the countries with coronavirus outbreak. Austria and other European countries have cut all transportation ties to northern italy. They have cancelled all gatherings and carnival in Venice. I am pretty sure situation is going to get worse (example china), Also be prepared to be quarantined by our US govt for 14 days when you are back.Edited: 5:57 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"So, we had planned a trip for the end of May but intend to wait it out. Today Liguria started adding closures and restrictions. This may just not be the right time to plan a foreign trip. If you assess the mater in a sober fashion, we are still looking at a virus that is both dangerous and highly contagious. It's unlikely we are anywhere near a peak in the infection and it's just getting a real foothold in Italy. Eventually, this will either become a global pandemic that will be one of the defining events for the century or a vaccine will be developed in time to stop that. But, for the time being I don't see the point in pushing a pleasure trip that might be impaired by quarantines, public anxiety and risks to health and life."
"Hi there. We are in the same position, travelling to Milan from Brisbane on April 14 and touring on our own from Milan to Sicily then heading north and ending up in Lake Como. Hard to know what to do as our travel insurance doesn't cover pandemics. Typical. Just wait and see but I'm not confident. Singapore Airlines and Smart Traveller still saying it is ok. So much fro updated information !"
Give it time. I am sure the airlines will be under increased pressure to cancel flights to/from Italy. It is my opinion that the airlines and travel industry as a whole will suffer tremendously from this virus as it continues to spread and travelers will decide not to fly or visit areas where there are outbreaks. The recirculated air in planes is bad enough without having the Coronavirus and an asymptomatic carrier unknowingly contaminating the cabin air.
"We canceled our trip to Italy and San Marino for this May. We had one hotel that was a nonrefundable booking and they refunded the money once we stated the reason.Our flights were booked with AA with miles. We called AA and explained the reason. They said they did not have anything yet in their system, but due to the situation in Italy, they put the miles back in our account without charging us for the fee. They also refunded the taxes we paid.We also canceled our cruise around Japan in April 2021.We are going to wait and see what happens before we decide on our trip to Switzerland this October. We also have a cruise Rome-Venice in Oct 2021.You just need to decide on what is best for your family if you are willing to take the risk or play it safe."
"#64 Hang on and maybe you won't lose your money if a travel ban is imposed. In the meantime, if I were in your position I would just try to get into extra careful good hygiene habits -- washing hands well and frequently, using hand sanitizer, keeping hands away from face and eyes (I have trouble with this one), getting some antibacterial wipes and using them to wipe down surfaces you come into contact with (plane tray tables, restaurant and cafe tables, door handles, cupboard handles, sink and toilet handles). (Those wipes can also be used for hands and face.) If you can't do that think about using a tissue to open doors, push elevator buttons, etc, then throwing it away. Get into the habit of looking at everything you do in the course of your day and asking yourself if there's a possible source of contamination. Stay healthy and get lots of fresh air and exercise. I have some masks on account of severe spring pollen allergies so would probably take some with me. I also have some disposable gloves I use for painting and cleaning, so might take some of those too, but don't know how effective either is. When there, I would stay away from crowded places, especially crowded indoor places. (When I was a child I was not allowed to go to the cinema or similar crowded places in the summer because of heightened risk of contracting polio then.)"
"My friend and I just discussed this and have decided to wait and see what happens in the next two weeks. Then we will make a decision. Of course, if flight and other travel restrictions are put in place the decision will be made for us.I so hope that the steps the Italian government is taking will have good results."
"I tend to agree. This week will likely see some real economic carnage. Airlines likely will stop trips from Milan soon enough. The Italian government has no real idea who ""patient zero"" is and hence no way to effectively track contacts. A global pandemic of a highly dangerous respiratory illness was always a question of ""when"" not ""if."" Governments were warned for decades that they needed to spend a lot more money on pandemic prevention, vaccine production capacity and preparation for large numbers of serious infections. But most failed. The US is absolutely unprepared and the last two budgets even cut CDC funding. The only positive note is that it could have been a lot worse. So far this virus isn't showing ""slate wiper"" case fatality rates, though it could likely be as bad as the 1918 flu. Maybe, just maybe, we will learn this time around."
"I am sure I will not be the only one to tell you to use an abundance of caution traveling with a transplant patient @ this time. The enclosed airplane, terminals and crowded area areas are not friendly to immuno-suppressed people.I would cancel."

Good news from the Brenner pass: Those two sick train passengers that brought train service to Austria to a halt have been tested negative. Trains will be running on schedule again.
"Yes, A Mainzer, I read that the shutdown lasted only 4 hours, which was apparently how long it took to get results of coronavirus test. I was very impressed with that, as it apparently often take days to get test results in US."
"I’m traveling from Washington DC to Rome on March 3-7 and was supposed to be in Venice on March 3-4. My overnight hotel in Venice and the round trip train ticket from Roma Termini station are non refundable. I’ve heard that museums in Venice are now closed. Just out of curiosity, I visited the Doge Palace museum website and it just says it’s closed on Monday, with no further details. Given the situation now, I’m thinking about canceling Venice and just staying in Rome. Whether Venice would shut down and tourists can get trapped is anybody’s guess. I think it’s highly unlikely that a city as big as Rome would shut down. My concern also is whether the US government would mandate quarantine on the way back from Italy if the situation worsens. I reviewed the State Department’s website. So far quarantine is only for travelers from Mainland China, whereas many countries including Japan, South Korea etc have a large number of corona virus cases. Any thoughts about that?"
We have plans mid March to fly to Milan and get right on a plane to Sicily. Thinking we should cancel. Will wait a week
"#83 A great deal is likely to change between now and March 3. I would wait before cancelling the trip to Venice (since your hotel and train fares are non-refundable) until close to your departure. Things may actually improve by March 3, such as museums reopening. The fact that the website for the Doge's Palace does not indicate any closures merely indicates that the website has not yet been updated. Conditions may also worsen. The odds of Venice being placed off limits is extremely slim, unless there are scores of people diagnosed with Coronavirus. The odds of the US imposing a quarantine on travelers from Italy are also quite slim, and in any event, some advance notice would be given. Check over the next several days whether there are many more reported cases. The total now is 149 (all in northern Italy, mainly Lombardy and Veneto), check again in 24, 48 and 72 hours. If the number is only slightly higher, that means that the virus is probably under control.According to media reports, both St. Mark's Basilica and St. Mark's square are now off limits, as is the Teatro La Fenice. That is very significant, but may change in a week."
"We are scheduled to fly into Milan March 6th and then take a car to Lugano, Switzerland. Mostly worried about the airport or being quarantined coming back from Milan. Would like to just fly straight into Switzerland but flight prices have tripled. If situation gets worse, surely the airlines will allow changes??"
"Post 70 (Maresc46) As a flight crew member of an Australian airline, I know it's not the recirculated air that's an issue in germ spread on a plane. It's the things you touch. You can see that evident in the number of people on the cruise ship who caught this disease and why germs like Norovirus are rampant. Use hand sanitising wipes on your tray, your armrests, your headrest and in the bathroom. Soapy water may be best but up in the sky, the wipes become more practical.Edited: 10:58 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"If a few cafes and hotels stay open, Venice might be a nice place to be next week! To see it empty for once."
Checking in here. We have a trip for early/mid April. Hoping for the best.

"Very clearly expressed advice.Just to note that applies to the whole Veneto region, from the Po Delta in the south, Cortina d'Ampezzo in the north, Lignano in the east ,and in the west the eastern shores of Lake Gardahttps://goo.gl/maps/yb7YoaAT8N3Ti9EJ8"
The problem in Italy is they have not identified the source so it will spreadMy stepson was due to fly to Venice today but has cancelledThe risk of quarantine is too great
"Don't know if it has been posted, but the National Austrian Railways stop has been revoked:https://www.ansa.it/canale_saluteebenessere/…"
"""The risk of quarantine is too great""Yes, rather than the disease itself (the mankind has faced way bigger issues) being stuck in the middle of a quarantine would be quite a problem for a foreign tourist. But this is limited mostly to Northern Eastern regions indeed."
"We are travelling Mid June to Mid July. Do you think it'll be alright? As in, we won't have to cancel our plans?"
I am gonna visit Milano-Verona-Venice on 26 February and willing to take the risk because I m 27 and hope my immune system is strong. I hope I will not die:)
"You're willing not only to risk your own health but also bring back the virus back to your community. So even if your immune system is strong and you won't have a serious condition in case you get the virus, you can spread the virus to your elderly neighbor who will. I think it's very irresponsible. That's exactly how the virus is spreading.I have tickets to Milano at the end of March, I guess I will see how the situation enrolls but for now it seems like I will rather skip it. I don't want to bring the virus back to my country, currently, there are no cases of Coronavirus there so far, and I hope that will continue to be the case. But people's irresponsibility is one of the reasons how the virus keeps spreading.Edited: 10:51 am, February 24, 2020 "
Melanie HI do not mean to insult your intelligence or knowledge as an airline employee but recirculated cabin air in an airplane could potentially be catastrophic in spreading the corona virus as opposed to simply touching trays and arm rests. To state otherwise is simply wrong.
"Per the US CDC:“Current understanding about how the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses.Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)Via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.The CDC also states:Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects:It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.So yes, recirculated airplane cabin air can be a huge culprit in the dissemination of the Corona virus and to ignore or challenge this idea is ludicrous. I’ll take the CDC opinion before an airline employee opinion any day when it comes virus transmission."
"We are also flying out on Thursday. Hotel have offered to move the booking, but no refund. Flights will be a loss if we don't use. Going to leave our decision to the last minute."
"My husband and I have a trip planned for April 1. We are both in our 30s but my husband has an autoimmune disease for which he takes immunosuppressants. He’s very careful about hand hygiene, but this is scary. Waiting it out a little before deciding whether we will cancel. At this point, we’ll be out just our flights and the cost of travel insurance, which didn’t cover pandemics."
"Brittany (Post #103)Our daughter is in the same boat as your husband. Our 3 week trip is scheduled for the end of May and we have pretty much decided that our Italy trip won’t happen this year. If there isn’t any harm/loss in doing so, I would recommend to wait and see if the airline you booked on will offer reimbursement (either refund or future travel) given the situation. Most airlines I fly that are based in the US are reasonable when it comes to situations like this that are beyond the control of individuals even when the ticket is “non-refundable.” Same for hotels, museums, etc."
"We have flight booking to Rome for a week from 7th March. We are going to take a decision to tonight, but it is increasingly likely we are going to cancel it. I do see people not cancelling it because insurance might not pay out. For us, our safety and life is more important than any money. We are above 60. 80% of those who died are above 60 years of age. So to say 2.3% of all infected people die gives a false impression to those who are above 60. As things stand right now, from Bloomberg:""There are 219 confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy, emergency commissioner Angelo Borrelli said. Five patients have died, and one has been declared free from infection."" This is from 3 cases last week.What concerns me is the ability to get back home after the visit. A few days back, Austria held up a train coming from Italy. Today passengers from an Alitalia flight are not being allowed to disembark in Mauritius. A coach coming from northern Italy has been blocked at Lyon’s Perrache station in southeast France because of a suspected case of coronavirus.Bottom line, the government still does not know the source of the virus and with some people remaining symptom free for up to 4 weeks the risk for the situation escalating is too high. Tourism does involve going to crowded areas in confined spaces as opposed to staying at home and going to work. Studies have indicated the virus can survive on a surface for upto a week, as opposed to 2 hours for other viruses. As more research is done, we will know more about the mechanism through which this virus is spreading so fast and across borders.Edited: 8:43 am, February 24, 2020 "
I’m booked for Milan the end of May so I am keeping a close watch on this. I’m hoping it’s gets contained and better by then but who knows. I’m wondering at what point do I consider changing my plans? Early to mid April?Also I’m curious how the airlines handle this situation. Would they waive the fee if the virus is shutting things down In cities your supposed to fly into?
Supposed to fly to Rome in 2 weeks. Everything is non refundable. We are still planning on going at this point. My main concern is being forced into quarantine and not being able to return home.
Read this posting regarding REFUNDS OF TRAIN TICKETS BY TRENITALIA AND ITALO TRENO:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…
"We have flights booked into Rome 3/15 and on to Munich 3/18, returning to the US 3/22. Not worried about the sickness but the thought of quarantine is worrisome. Will be following closely with you all!"
"My family has plans to visit Rome March 13-21, layover in London both ways. I'll be watching this thread and I wish Italy success in the attempts to contain the coronavirus. As others have pointed out, who knows what the situation will be as time goes on - in Italy and elsewhere. I have a huge conference to attend in San Francisco in April and I'm even wondering if that will be impacted. For now I'll just wait and see and make last minute decisions."
"We are on a Tauck land tour in April. This means bus with people who I have no idea where they are from, plus now the situation in Italy seems to be getting worse by the day. I hope that it gets under control, as everyone does. But if it doesn’t no way will we risk going and get ting sick or quarantined, I just hope Tauck cares enough to cancel if it doesn’t get better."
"Great info here that pertains not only to Italy but to many destinations. Plenty of decisions to be made based on financial losses, the risk of being exposed/ill, becoming a future carrier (possibly asymptomatic), and travel delays/quarantines. Last week I cancelled a trip to Malaysia planned for early March due to these concerns which completely apply to traveling anywhere there is a coronavirus outbreak:1) my 8 hr layover in the Hong Kong airport;2) close contact on my Cathay Pacific flight to Malaysia;3) potential travel delays/quarantines;4) potential illness/being far from a hospital (backpacking Borneo);5) potentially becoming an asymptomatic carrier.The moment I received an email from Cathay notifying me of a significant flight change, I called/received a full refund. I then called Delta Airlines regarding my (completely separate) flight from Orlando to New York and told them what happened. I was given a credit, no questions asked.Before I got lucky enough for the refund/credit, I asked myself if I would plan that trip ""today"" and the answer was ""no way."" That is when I realized the trip wasn't worth any potential financial loss. Your health and the health of others is far more important than money. If you're worried about the money, I recommend waiting as long as possible to make your decision. Ask for refunds/credits on flights/hotels that you think are non-refundable. These are extraordinary times and it's likely you will receive that refund/credit.Edited: 11:29 am, February 24, 2020 "
"If anyone is wondering about activity in Italy right now, then have a look at www.skylinewebcams.com, then click on Italy.Most all popular destinations can be viewed in real time.Life looks pretty much normal in all places as you would expect for February."
"I am in the same situation,should be in Venice 29 March and Considering to cancel"
"We are booked to travel to Milan next week with BA holidays. We asked yesterday could we reschedule or go elsewhere and we’re told a flat no! Any cancellation would be non refundable. We could change our flights for a change fee of £100 per flight - £400 for two return flights.It’s not the risk of infection that worries us, but we’ve paid for a holiday and yet the main attractions are now closed and I suspect Milan will flow Venice and also close bars and restaurant’s."

We have an early June flight from Rome to Israel. Israel is now introducing flight restrictions from Italy. I wonder if this is still in effect in June if El Al will refund tickets?
"I have an upcoming trip to Rome and Naples in mid-March. Here is what concerns me. Cases of COVID-19 began ballooning in the northern areas of Italy over the weekend and the government promptly imposed quarantines and restrictions.However, given the 14-day incubation period of this virus (a Washington Post article suggests it could be even more) I wonder how many infected people have traveled outside of those areas before the lock down. Those people could be anywhere (Rome, Naples, Florence, Sicily...you name it)I haven't heard of any testing being instituted in any other areas. I am afraid we may soon see people getting sick in other places within Italy as the incubation period ends and symptoms start appearing."
"Those people could be anywhere, including in other countries of Europe and outside of Europe!That's why the situation will certainly change, but at some point will start to flatten out and improve (perhaps by mid-March???)."
I posted this article from the Atlantic but I’ll post it here alsohttps:/…Bottom line is more than likely we will all get this. And probably the vast majority of us will have no clue.
I am looking at canceling my plans for southern Italy in March. I read the governor of a province near Naples (I think) is threatening to quarantine anyone traveling from the north. I think many public spaces like museums will close temporarily. You can wait to cancel airlines last minute to see if they offer refund if authorities declare an emergency. Check your lodging cancellation dates.
Can you please post the link to where it says Israel is restricting flights from Italy? That’s a big deal. Expedia is still allowing flight booking from Rome to Tel Aviv.

"It is important that if providing information people include links to sources. Please don’t present news or opinion without source. It is important to be aware of the pressures on public health systems in Italy right now. I have added some more to the thread on official information herehttps:/…105702046Indicative of the difficulty managing the problem is advice that people showing symptoms not go to a doctor or Emergency, but call an emergency number."
"I am using ANSA.it online for general Italian news. It reported today that Israel, Ireland, Serbia, and Bosnia are advising their citizens not to travel to Italy. It also reported 225 cases now. However it said there appears to be no spread out of the already reported areas."
"Two leading Italian virologists, who have been appearing on a daily basis on Italian national news programs, both stated today that, within 7-10 days, there will be enough information to determine whether the draconian measures heretofore adopted in Northern Italy have succeeded in containing the spread of Coronavirus, or whether additional measures may need to be considered.In my very personal opinion, it seems that anyone having reservations for travel to Italy more than 10 days from today would be well served to ""hold tight"" and patiently wait to see how this situation evolves, rather than incurring cancellation penalties, unless there are very special considerations at play."
"Following, i have a trip planned end of May and June.."
126 and 127... can you provide links please. Those look valuable sources. We must all encourage people to provide links to avoid rumour spreading.
Well even Tom Cruise is stuck in his hotel in Venice.https://fxn.ws/2Pn7aij
"I found conflicting info when I researched Israel. While they are banning people from several countries, the most current info on Italy I got was same as #124 -- that is, they are THINKING OF quarantining people arriving from Australia and Italy, and are advising Israelis not to travel to Italy.Edited: 4:10 pm, February 24, 2020 "
#130That's a sensationalist story. Venice is not locked down. There are however restraints on gatherings of people.
"I WOULD NOT trust the figures released by the Chinese gov regarding ""number of infection cases, recovery n death rates etc etc"".The virus is extremely contagious and the death rate is probably several times higher than current statistics. Take extra precautions!!"
We'll be showing up in Venice March 18th. A lot is going to change by then; I can't see why we wouldn't still be going.
"Hlai, I agree that people should definitely take precautions to prevent the spread of infection. Especially those with compromised immune systems or otherwise in a high-risk group, but I can't help but think that your response that ""the death rate is probably several times higher than current statistics"" is a bit ironic given the very prudent request by Dennis and others that people NOT speculate or post anything without sources as to not alarm people. I hope everyone stays healthy!"
"Tom Cruise's movie may have been required to suspend production for a week, but if Cruise is ""stuck"" in his hotel I can only assume it's because he's too much of a wuss to go outside."
#133Can you please provide a link to the source of your opinion?Seechinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/24/WS5e2a95d9a310…for some facts
Thank you Dennis! Its so important to state the facts instead of speculations. Please link your sources!We're leaving in June from US to London to Venice and Rome and I'm hoping this is an afterthought by then.
"We’re in southern Italy currently for a week, and to be honest, I’m quite nervous. I know we’re far from the north, but in the age of travel I’m certain things are far more spread throughout both Italy and Europe than just that region. Being 23 weeks pregnant (and therefore with a suppressed immune system) makes me want to take the next flight home. Currently just waiting and following the news."
"I'm following this thread as we have a trip planned in the beginning of May. Hopefully any outbreak will be contained by them. I am not certain if this was posted before but here is a link to the CDC's page on coronavirus. https:/…coronavirus-italyIt's interesting to note that they say:""At this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Italy. If you travel to Italy, take the following steps:Avoid contact with sick people.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose."""
"Caitlin, sensible time to be concerned.I've put some facts herehttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…about what is being done in the north to control any spread of disease. As evident in #3 at that page, regional governments well away from centres of disease have set up tough rules.Be aware that ordinary influenza is at the moment a far greater risk. Avoid crowds. Wash hands thoroughly.. and use disinfectant on that dirtiest of objects, the phone. When do you fly home and from where?"
"Just want to say to Dennis A: Thanks for all the level headed advice on many topics and for your sense of humor (as in ""older people (me too) fall off the perch earlier"". LOL."
"just FYI, original post was about April, not Sept."
"We fly from Bari to Frankfurt Saturday then home to Atlanta on Sunday.

"For those who understand Italian, this informative interview from this evening's Italian TV news program OTTO E MEZZO of leading Italian virologist Dr. Fabrizio Pregliasco may be helpful to place the Coronavirus issue in perspective.

"CDC's website has been updated. They changed the statement that said ""At this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Italy"" to ""Because older adults and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe disease, people in these groups should discuss travel with a healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel."""
"Maresc46. Please don't inbox me to bully me to remove my post regarding the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). That article you quote from in your post (#101) actually points out that the virus is thought to be spread by person to person transmission. As to whether I'd cancel a trip to Italy? The flight wouldn't bother me, but the close confines of people in the tourist spots would sway my decision. I have a holiday planned to Canada later inthe year and will monitor the situation as the time gets closer. Being unable to leave a country to return home is a concern of mine."

"I was following this thread and the Roman forum. Before exiting the Italy/Rome forum, I thought I would give an update. After much thought, I called the Delta Platinum line and cancelled our tickets to Rome. We also cancelled our Hilton hotel booking and also all viator tours, neither of which had a cancellation fee. We were going to Rome for a vacation and to relax, but with the sustained spread of disease and as yet no idea the source of the virus there is likelihood of more infections. While this is affecting the northern parts of Italy, it could well spread south to Rome being a single country with people and tourists traveling from north to south. We are going to rebook to a South American country where there is summer. The flu and other similar viruses are active in the winter. I respect those who have chosen to continue with their travels. Best wishes and safe travels for those who are going to go ahead with their vacation. Hopefully in the near future we can visit this wonderful city and country."
"Maybe living in Toronto through SARS has hardened me, made me less panic stricken, but looking at the very low death rate of Covid-19, I know I won’t be cancelling my May trip to Italy unless forced to by our airline, property management, the WHO or Italian Government!Lunga vita all’italia!"
Could you please tell us what the up shot of the interview was for those of us who cant understand Italian? Have a trip for 13th of March and still planning on going at this stage but dont want to be reckless either so the more informed we can be the better.
"The upshot of the interview of Italian virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco hyperlinked in posting #150 above is that the Coronavirus situation in Northern Italy has been blown out of proportion by excessively alarmist media coverage (much of it by Italian media), BUT that the draconian measures implemented with respect to the 11 small towns directly affected was necessary to attempt to contain further spread of the virus and to avoid a worst case scenario.According to Dr. Pregliasco, the WORST CASE scenario contemplates a 40% contagion rate of the entire Italian population (meaning roughly 24 million residents) , 10% of which would require some form of medical treatment (2,400,000), That number of patients would immediately overwhelm Italian medical facilities. Consider also that about 5% of cases (1.200,000) would be considered ""grave"" and could require intensive care facilities.The second point with respect to the worst case scenario is purely ECONOMIC in nature: Italy would suffer a very severe economic downturn if it became necessary to place millions of residents in quarantine. Factories would stop producing. Services would stop. Tourism for the critical summer season would be decimated, and tourist cities like Venice and Florence would be devastated economically.So, the limited quarantine imposed to date is designed to ""nip in the bud"" the potential for a worst case.Dr. Pregliasco ended the interview (see hyperlink in posting #147) by stating that WITHIN ONE WEEK FROM TODAY, the Italian Government should have enough information to determine whether the containment efforts have largely succeeded, or whether further steps will need to be considered.SO LET'S ALL HOLD OUR BREATH AND WAIT UNTIL NEXT MONDAY or so."
"My opinion is that each person has to gather all available information and make that decision for themselves. I was faced with a similar decision for business trips to Singapore and China. Canceling a China business trip was an easy decision given the Level 4 Do Not Travel warning from the USA State Department. Canceling the Singapore business trip was a judgement call based on the fact that I have an underlying health condition. I received a complete refund of my airfare in both cases and will reschedule both business trips after the epidemic is declared over. In the case of Italy, the coronavirus situation is still unfolding. The majority of cases are in the Lombardy Region (near Milan) and the Veneto Region (near Venice). The Italian government has locked down about 10 smaller towns and other aggressive public health measures. I think you should monitor all media reports carefully including Italian media (there should be some English-language Italian media). If there are cases outside of Lombardy and Veneto and a continuing dramatic ongoing increase in the number of cases and deaths in Italy then that may point towards canceling. If it stabilizes and does not spread any more in Italy then that may point towards making the trip. Even then you can always remove Venice, Padua, Milan and any other Northern Italian city from your plans. But again only you can make this decision. Given your April travel plans, you can afford to wait and watch for 2-3 more weeks before deciding. Finally, if you do go then get travel insurance beforehand and take all protective measures such as hand washing, wearing a mask, avoiding sick people, avoiding crowds, etc. Good luck."
"#159, one of the problems with the tripadvisor system here is that you think you're replying to x but your reply just gets stuck on the end.There's been a lot of discussion of sources of information here and this has been establishedhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…"
"Dennis A - You are right. The original poster is long gone. There are a large number of posts about the coronavirus on Trip Advisor which all generate a large number of replies in a short period of time. In almost all of them, the original poster disappears early on. These discussion threads take on a life of their own with little relation to the original poster. I am beginning to think they are not worth replying to. Instead, they are worth reading especially if they contain replies from people who are actually there. Again, I think each person needs to make decisions for themselves about their upcoming trips just like I did."
Can someone provide information what tourist attractions closed in Venice. All museums are closed or private museums open? What about churches? What about Vicenza and Padua? Is museums closed there as well? I am going to be there in a week. Wondering what will be able for visit if they will not open public spaces after March 1.
"I have a package tour starts from London which includes Venice, Rome and Florence mid March.I have a big concern with Coronavirus outbreak and keeping eyes on it. As others, I may not be able to cancel my travel without loosing big money unless the government bans the travel to Italy.Yes. I do have N95 masks and hand sanitizes if I have to go for travel."
"Desperately wanting to also know myself, it'll ruin the my trip if everywhere is closed"
"The closure ordinance issued yesterday by the Veneto regional government affects ALL churches and museums region-wide in Veneto. This would include private museums (they must also abide by the ordinance). The ordinance is currently valid through March 3. We don't know whether the ordinance will be extended. With museums and churches closed, tourists are essentially limited to admiring the local architecture and urban scenery, which may understandably be insufficient for some. It's unfortunate that there is not more lead time for purposes of making informed decisions about changing travel plans."
"Thank you everybody for your posts and for some valuable insight. I have canceled my trip to Italy. I was supposed to be in Rome and Venice from March 3-7. It was a part of a bigger trip which includes some other countries currently not affected by the epidemic. I had to be online with Expedia for almost 2 hours and at the end I was able to change/ cancel some bookings to completely avoid Italy. It cost me around a thousand dollars, as one of the flights was non refundable. Just as a background, I’m a 43 year old otherwise healthy person with mild asthma. I’m a practicing physician and I could not risk getting stuck in Italy, having to go through mandatory quarantine on my way back to the US or even worse, bring the infection back to my family, colleagues or patients. For those who are still planning to travel, best of luck. Please be safe."
"I planned Milano-Verona-Venice trip between 26-4 march and I was willing to take the risk but after I read the last news about Italy, just canceled my trip and didn't get any refund. I have lost 700 euros but my life is more important than money. Also, many people say that ""there will be no virus when the weather will be warm and more than 27 degrees"" however in Thailand there is a virus and the temperatures were more than 30 last month. So I don't believe that statement.I am not the expert about corona but some people are saying that N95 mask can protect from u but I don't think so. I think everyone who lives around the world, just go on holiday for havin fun and chillin but under these circumstances it will no longer be like this.My advice to u guys, just skip the trip and don't go.Edited: 2:43 am, February 25, 2020 "
Our trip is in just under four weeks. I prefer to wait and gather additional factual information rather than make emotional decisions.
"I have checked with the insurance company and the airline. The chances of refunds are low. We are going to try to keep our bookings but 12 months hence. We have paid upfront and will not be asking for refunds but asking for,our bookings to be transferred 12 months ahead. Not sure how we will fare, but we feel it may be a win for both sides. Airfares, train bookings and car hire may be an issue, but we may just have to cut our losses. We are not prepared at the moment to take a risk or visit areas which may be shut down. No good fighting what you can’t win. Good luck to everyone. Let’s hope we all come out of this healthy and not too poor."
"What is it that you have read that has made you cancel your trip so quickly?Everything i am reading is asking for calm and that the areas are very isolated and concentrated. Of course this is now and may not be the case in a couple of weeks but if you arent going to get anything back from insurance why rush the decision, could be all over in a week or so.if we dont hear of any cases in other parts of italy by the beginning of next week we will have gone a long way towards isolating it wouldnt we? at the end of the day this could pop up anywhere just like it did over the weekend in Italy while i want to be careful i dont want to go running scared there are risks of getting a flu everywhere you go outside of the corona virus.Everyone needs to make their own choice completely agree, am i being too careless with this?"
"PS it seems to be an area with a large number of old people is that correct? people who have been reported as fatal have all been old with health issues and i have heard it is a rich area most likely older people was my thought, any confirmation?"
"#170, 171You are taking a practical course to delay decision for now. Though people are entitled to choose their own course, as you will understand. As regards 171, it's not that there are more older people there but that older people and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable. With the enigma of significant involvement of young and fit also. As regards wealth this the wealthier end of a country we tend to see people referring to in search for quaint villages when Italy is a significant global economy, member of the G7, which Australia is not, just a member of the G20.Trying to maintain official and well sources info herehttps:/…105712425"
"Hello everyone, i have booked an apartment near Milan on hotels.com, for the week of Salone del Mobile 18.04-26.04. Unfortunately my booking is non-refundable. The event would most likely cancel. Could I cancel the booking without penalty? There is somebody who cancel his non-refundable booking and get money back?Thank you in advance and good health to you all"
#173Wait. This situation is several days old. Things may be clearer soon.
We are scheduled to arrive in Rome on Monday March 2 and as of now there are no new cases in Rome. I am hoping to stick with our plans but if there is an outbreak there then we won't be risking our lives.
If you read for example the live blog at The Guardian you will see the speed with which individual places may be locked down because of single positive cases. https:/…
"My trip to Italy is still two months away, I do not intend to cancel anything for at least one month, and see how things evolve. Exposure to coronavirus is one concern (not a big one to me or my wife) but what also worries me is the possibility of tourist attractions, transportation, even restaurants being closed depending on where a new outbreak turns up."
"Here are some facts which I believe warrant travelers to exercise caution before quickly cancelling their trips to Italy:The RATE OF INCREASE of new Coronavirus cases has dropped precipitously in Italy over the past three days: from a 100% increase (75 to 150), to a 50% increase (150 to 229) to a 25% increase (229 to 287). To an non-expert like me, this seems quite significant.Moreover, consider these additional facts:1. All seven fatalities in Italy were elderly patients with pre-existing conditions, some quite severe;2. 80% of cases recover without need of medical assistance;3. The vast majority of cases in Italy occurred within or have been traced to contagion within the ""red zones"" (mainly the Province of Lodi in southern Lombardy).The quarantine was imposed on Sunday, which means that there will certainly be additional new cases reported over the next week (because the incubation period is up to 14 days in the vast majority of cases). But by next Monday, and certainly within two weeks hence, we will know with high confidence whether the draconian measures heretofore imposed by the Italian Government in quarantining the red zones has been largely effective.Consequently, were I to be traveling to Italy in the near future, this is how I would react:1. If travelling two weeks hence, I would simply monitor the situation and not cancel anything immediately;2. If travelling one week hence, I would monitor the situation and be prepared to cancel or modify the trip on short notice;3. If travelling within one week, I would rearrange my trip to skip over Milan and Venice and other tourist towns in Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, but primarily because churches and museums are closed, and I would be greatly disappointed by that reality."
"We are due to fly to Venice on 16th March. The B&B where we are staying for 5 nights required cancellation (if necessary) 14 days before arrival to avoid payment. We don't want to cancel if we can avoid it. We have contacted the B&B and asked if the cancellation period could be reduced. The owner has readily agreed to cut it to 7 days to give us more time to see how things develop. This is a great help to us and we are very grateful to her. If we do have to cancel, we will definitely book the same B&B for a stay when this is all over."
"Thank you for all the level-headedness on this thread. I sought various sources after seeing initial media headlines because I suspected some level of sensationalism. The links to Italian sources, government information, and on the ground experiences have been highly useful. I am definitely keeping all my travel plans to Rome/Naples leaving in 2.5 weeks and expecting the best at this point. Who knows - in 2 weeks the focus may be on an entirely different part of the globe."
!@179 is a good example of what most hotels should do under these unprecedented circumstances...give guests flexibility. This is another good reason it is best to book directly with the hotel..don't assume a non refundable room is that....give the hotel a call and see what options might be available if your trip is within say next week or two. Over the years I have found most to be very understanding and at least be willing to move the booking into the future.
"I’m waiting to see what we will do. We are on a 15 day land tour throughout the south to north to Venice. So not only do we have the issue of hotels, crowds, restaurants staying careful there is also the bus with 40 people I don’t know, or know where they came from. Following closely and hoping this thing ends in a couple of weeks.But I’m going to cancel and money will be lost, but what kind of vacation is one where all you do is wear a mask and worry about every human one sees? If it was business, maybe, but a vacation no thanks."
"sorry dup.Edited: 8:52 am, February 25, 2020 "
"Thanks GAC, that’s about where I’m at. I’m thinking we’ll keep our flight into Marco Polo and just cancel the Venice hotel and go to Bologna or Florence. It’s hard to decipher between the media reports, so everyone’s in person experiences have been valuable."
Hard to say which town/city will be next...one thing to watch carefully if at any point your home country requires people who have traveled to certain places to be in quarantine....at the extreme they will stop flights. No one knows at this point what will happen...the bad thing about this virus is it passes easily and people can be asymptomatic for a long period of time.
"#184 Kimberly:Bear in mind that in Bologna (and the rest of Emilia Romagna, if adhering to the regional ordinance), all museums will be closed through March 1, and churches open only for individual prayer and not for tourist visits. These limitations follow those in other regions of Northern Italy."
"I am flying to Rome today, staying for four days, going on to Florence, staying for three days, driving around Tuscany & Umbria for about five days, and then flying back to the US from Rome. Have obviously been watching the situation very closely. This morning, I emailed the Uffizi in Florence and the Etruscan museum at Villa Giulia in Rome, asking about the likelihood that they would close due to coronavirus/covid-19 concerns. They both responded very promptly (within 30 minutes) to say that they too were watching the situation closely, staying in touch with Italy's national health authorities, and had no plans at present to close due to these concerns."
"Thanks everyone and a very good reply #178.We are going to Venice, Florence and Rome starting in 2 weeks and some of this is paid and not refundable. We are monitoring the situation and we will decide nearer the time particularly re Venice. We dont want to find we cannot even go onto Florence from Venice due to quarantine - better to drop Venice and fly direct to Florence. And I have been so looking forward to this first trip to Italy"
"We are due to fly to Milan middle of March on the Gate1 Tuscany fly and drive deal (but planning to only take trains) then stay longer to go to La Spezia for 2 nights and 2 nights in Milan before flying home. If anybody made it to Milan, Montecatini , Siena, Lucca, Cinque terra, please let me know the situation there with the trains, the quarantine situation and if there's panic hoarding with people emptying shelves, etc .... Thank you."
"We plan to be in Florence, Lucca, Assisi, Arezzo, San Gimignano, Siena, etc. during the first week and a half of March. Plan to take train from Rome and rent a car for Tuscany-Umbria after a few days in Florence. I will continue to post here. Happy trails!Edited: 10:56 am, February 25, 2020 "
"I am flying to Naples this Sunday March 1st. I am not afraid to go but fed up listening to people I work with say things like ""you better not bring the virus back with you""...That is freaking me out. I have spoken with a couple of people from Naples and they say all is ok.I would hate to cancel my trip! If anyone has any insight please do say!Edited: 11:29 am, February 25, 2020 "
@GAC - post 120. So true. New reports regarding other European countries:https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/…
"My fiance and I have our honeymoon planned March 14-28'th and are wondering how this situation is going to pan out. We planned an entire tour of the country: Rome - Naples - Positano -Milan - Florence - Rome. I'm now wondering if we should amend our trip to avoid Milan and Florence, or avoid Italy altogether? Sigh."
"So far, of the places you plan to visit, only Milan is in the quarantined area. Much will be clearer next week."
Like everyone else we are paying attention. My primary issue is getting quarantined when away from home. That can happen quickly and without enough notice to get out. Our situation does not allow us to be gone more than a day or two from what is planned.
"@S35flyerfollow as much news as possible regarding potential for being quarantined. Also, Dennis A started this ""official information"" thread that might be useful to you:https:/…105719283"
"#194: Please note that the city and the province of Milan are NOT NOT subject to quarantine! The quarantine affects only 10 small towns in the province of Lodi, southeast of Milan. These small towns are not frequented by tourists.Milan is affected by the Cornasvirus situation insofar as churches and museums are closed until next week, large public gatherings/conventions are banned, bars, nightclubs and discos are closed between 6 pm and 6 am, and all schools and universities are closed. Restaurants, cafeterias and daytime café/bars are open, as are hotels.Edited: 3:22 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"CBS News reported today at 2:40PM - scroll down on the link to find this article entitled ""Italy reports 10 coronavirus deaths as cases spike 45%"" :The new cases also included ones well outside the two hard-hit northern regions, including three in Sicily, two in Tuscany and one in Liguria.""https:/…Edited: 4:11 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"The death count is now 11, but it is important to note that all 11 were elderly patients with significant pre-existing conditions. That does not diminish the tragedy, but adds some context. The number of confirmed infected persons is now 325, up from 229 yesterday (+42%). Here, it is important to note that Italy has TESTED a far greater number of people than other countries in Europe, which likely accounts for the higher statistics. Nevertheless, only 15-20% of cases are considered ""serious"", and only 5% are ""grave"". The vast majority of infected persons manifest only slight symptoms and recover at home. ALL the cases are residents of Italy (none are foreigners, apart from the original two Chinese tourists in Rome, both of whom are recovering).We should fully anticipate that by next week if not sooner, EVERY POLITICAL REGION OF ITALY will have some infected persons, but that does not necessarily create an insurmountable problem, as long as the numbers remain SMALL. By next week, the numbers should tell the Italian Government whether the draconian measures heretofore adopted have largely succeeded in containing the contagion, or if additional measures will need to be considered.Almost all of the new cases of infected persons can be traced back to physical contacts with infected persons in the small quarantined area of southeastern Lombardy.The reason for the quarantine of the 10 small towns in Lombardy and 1 in Veneto is to hopefully ""nip in the bud"" any widespread contagion. Because the virus is new, is reportedly easy to contract, even from asymptomatic carriers, and there is no standard medical treatment or vaccine currently available, there is great fear by virologists of a ""worst case"" pandemic which could generate many millions of sick persons world-wide, a number greater than the ability of nations to handle.While media attention is currently focused on China, South Korea, Iran and Italy, the reality is that the virus in all likelihood has still far to travel.As far as concerns tourists in Italy, the greatest disruption is that churches and museums in a number of tourist cities such as Milan, Venice, Turin, Verona, Padova (but not south of the Apennines), are closed until at least next week. Restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, pharmacies and daytime cafes/bars are all open for business."

I just hope we'll be quick about it and stop travel into and out of Italy. We also need to rescue our citizens from that hotzone. We worked quickly when it was just China lets not drop the ball now!
"SUPPLEMENT TO POSTING #223With reference to the Trenitalia refund request form hyperlinked in posting #223 above, I note with interest several points:1. There is no stated ""cutoff date"" within which a refund request must be mailed. I QUESTION whether Trenitalia will strictly enforce their stated cutoff date of March 1 (which might also be expressly extended)2 The customer is given the option of choosing among several FORMS OF REFUND, including BANK WIRE TRANSFER. There are spaces to indicate the customer's bank account IBAN number and international BIC/SWIFT/ABA codes. I QUESTION whether this means that it MIGHT be possible to get a wire transfer refund of ANY Trenitalia ticket purchased on or before February 23 (including a ticket for the reserved Freccia or Intercity train, for which the refund is supposed to be only by travel voucher valid for one year from date of issuance)I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, but persons seeking a refund by mail using this form may wish to TRY to get a monetary refund rather than a travel voucher.Persons already in Italy wishing a refund may consider going to the nearest Trenitalia ticket office, where the refund may get processed more quickly (perhaps even by a refund in the form of cash over the counter).A large majority of foreigners will probably be seeking a refund for a ticket on one of the reserved Freccia/Intercity trains, rather than on the unreserved regionale trains, and many may have a strong preference for a cash refund (even in the form of a bank wire transfer) instead of a refund in the form of a travel voucher.The penultimate page of the Trenitalia form gives ADDRESSES where the request for refund should be MAILED, together with the paper ticket (I don't know what happens if the ticket is in electronic format, maybe the request still gets processed if the form has otherwise been completely filled out).IF ANYONE HAS ANY LUCK IN GETTING A CASH REFUND FOR A TICKET ON A TRENITALIA FRECCIA/INTERCITY TRAIN (or indeed any relevant information not found on the Trenitalia website), PLEASE POST!!!!"
"SUPPLEMENT TO POSTING #226I forgot to mention an important point: if you are holding a Trenitalia ticket which is refundable according to its own terms (for example, a ""BASE"" fare ticket for the Freccia/Intercity train), you can always seek a refund in accordance with the contract terms of the ticket, irrespective of the temporary procedures for ticket refunds due to the Coronavirus situation. These latter temporary procedures are primarily for the benefit of holders of NONREFUNDABLE tickets, but also to avoid the 20% cancellation penalty for ""BASE"" fare tickets, situations where it is normally too late to request a refund, or the refund fee for unreserved regionale train tickets."
Thank you for the information. It looks as if I might as well wait to cancel as I won't be receiving a cash refund anyway and I won't be able to use a voucher in the next year. The whole voucher thing is kind of a bummer. The train trips are Rome to Venice and Rome to Naples and back.
"We were due to take a train to Venice tomorrow from Austria. OBB have decided to refund everyone with train tickets to Italy up until March 1st.

Even after us asking to just change the date they refused. Stating that it is still ""safe to travel"".

"With reference to posting # 231, I hyperlink below a small portion of an interview of well-known Italian journalist and author Beppe Severgnini of the Corriere della Sera newspaper, who appeared on this evening's Italian TV news program OTTO E MEZZO with Lilli Gruber. He expresses his opinion that, while Coronavirus is indeed a serious matter, the Media, by its sensationalized reporting of events and by needlessly spreading alarm, has not acted responsibly and has done more harm than what was warranted given the circumstances. He also notes that public reaction has betrayed a fragility of attitudes which derives from society's inability to accept the unavoidable uncertainties of matters almost completely outside of its control, something particularly difficult for the current generation. The uncertainties created by Coronavirus has made people feel vulnerable and anxious and prompted reactions which at times have been exaggerated and unwarranted.https://www.la7.it/otto-e-mezzo/video/beppe-…As I read the countless postings on this and many other threads asking for opinions on whether to cancel their upcoming trip to Italy, the thoughts expressed in this interview come to mind.Perhaps Coronavirus is the unwelcome ""wake up call"" to us all that, in the future, we will need to accept the fact that some events will remain outside of our control, that we will not be able to control everything, that there will always be important uncertainties, but that we should resist the natural temptation to take actions designed to avoid all risk regardless of severity or probability. Otherwise, we risk becoming the victims of our own fears and desires to shun everything which we cannot completely control or understand.Edited: 5:28 pm, February 26, 2020 "

If it is something else, can it be clarified?""My comment about waiting until next week before taking drastic action (especially if travel is beyond the middle of March) is based NOT on my personal opinion, which would have NO VALUE as I am neither a physician nor a virologist nor an epidemiologist, but RATHER on the opinion of two leading Italian virologists interviewed on Italian television last Monday, whom I watched on TV and who made this comment and also explained WHY it will take this amount of time.Essentially, because the average incubation period for this Coronavirus is 5.6 days (but as long as 14 days in 95% of cases), by early next week it will have been 7 days since the quarantine was imposed on the 11 small towns in Lombardy and Veneto, and experts should be able to evaluate whether this quarantine has been largely successful or not.In the meantime, it is a certainty that the number of cases will increase each day, and experts will be watching the RATE of increase, to see if and when it ""peaks"" and begins to fall.These experts have also pointed out that the Coronavirus, while very contagious (apparently even by asymptomatic patients), has a RELATIVELY low mortality rate (2-3%) and also a RELATIVELY low rate requiring intensive care hospitalization (about 5-10%). In Italy, also because of the high number of elderly residents, so far ALL of the fatalities have been people over 62 with significant pre-existing medical conditions. But there have also been serious cases involving people under 60. Nevertheless, approximately 80% of cases are considered mild.The REAL CONCERN of the experts is that if the virus were to spill out of control and infect 30-40% of the population (these are numbers quoted by Virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco of the University of Milan), there could be as many as one to two MILLION Italians needing to be hospitalized, which is well beyond the capability of Italy's health care system. These of course are WORST CASE scenarios which the Italian Government is trying to head off by the quarantine and other restrictions.In the meantime, the greatest damage has been to Italy's ECONOMY and especially to the TOURIST TRADE, which is witnessing extremely high cancellation rates for hotels and complementary facilities/services, especially through Easter, but also beyond.A number of Italian commentators, journalists, politicians and medical experts (whom I have heard on Italian TV and read in Italian print media) have also voiced the opinion that the media coverage of this situation has been excessively alarmist and sensationalist, especially by not placing it in proper context.Edited: 7:28 pm, February 26, 2020 "
I think unless you are leaving in the next couple of weeks the advice to wait until next week frankly is common sense...probably based on watching on this has evolved in other countries. Really needs no explanation.
"You're right. Many more people have died from common flu. HOWEVER, people aren't being subjected to quarantine for simply traveling to a place that has the common flu. This has real travel implications. As well, covid-19 is much more deadly (percentage-wise) with no anti-virus. That is why governments are taking such a strong stance in their efforts to contain it. Should the average person panic...no, I don't believe so. But should travelers consider what it could mean to them? Absolutely."
"I am a nurse and Yes its true the FLU is out of controlled this year, but at least many many have survived as it can be detected, tested and cured. Where as CORONAVIRUS there is no test so by the time someone gets it they are too ill ( because it looks like the common cold) and no treatment will cure it by that time.I am going in June and I called the airline all they say is not yet only in 4 towns in ITALY.. Whats scary is that people travel all over Italy so there will be illness in those other areas? Are they checking EVERYONE in every city in Italy? Also its scary to go to Italy and everyone is wearing mask, you need to wash your hands constantly, if anyone coughs you will be scared. Also you go to restaurants and you will be using their utensils, not that before your not concern. but now it is scary..What I don't understand everyday more and more coronavirus is reported in Italy, Why not quarantine the country until they get a better handle of things?I hope. you all bought travel insurance? I did thank goodness because by the time they suspend Italy to travel it maybe too late...Edited: 9:26 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"""Where as CORONAVIRUS there is no test"" - uh, yes, there is. And why would I be scared simply at the sight of a mask or someone coughing? Basic handwashing and hygiene re coughing etc should practiced anyway. ""Quarantine the country"" - what? What would that even mean?Are you certain you're a nurse? I would have thought you'd come into contact with far more concerning things in an given workweek.I have a trip planned at the end of May, I'll be surprised if the situation doesn't improve by then. In the meantime I'm not freaking out over it.Edited: 9:31 pm, February 26, 2020 "
By the time they test you its too late if you are very ill. Smart Alex....most pp think it's a simple cold.. You don't have to panic no-one said but its growing everyday... READ CDC!! Its a level 2 so far and they anticipate it to be a level 1 in the next few weeks...
"""I am a nurse ....Where as CORONAVIRUS there is no test.""Are you really a nurse? There IS a test. By the way, have you read many medical reports that more than 80% of people infected by the CV show no or very mild symptoms and don't get sick?"
You don't get it...Yes there is a test. Most pp on vacation are not going to get tested by going to a hospital internationally. But you are willing to get exposed and wait to get sick and then be tested in Italy Hospital... THIS IS A CHOICE TO GOt...To take a big chance of exposure.. You will be around pp and every time someone is coughing or wearing a mask.. I don't know about you but when I go on vacay its to relax not worry about getting this VIRUS...AGAIN THIS IS A CHOICE AND ITS CHANGING DAILY..

"We are scheduled to depart for Rome on Mar 6, return via Milan Mar. 16 and obviously very concerned. CDC is currently NOT recommending postponing/cancelling Italy travel. We are forging ahead and keeping track of development. I did not read every post on this thread, but really appreciate GAC of LA and Dennis of Australia informative posts. BTW, the mortality rate of 2-3% was attributed to patients in China. Outside of China, the mortality rate was 0.7%, though this is likely to change with very high mortality rate observed in Iran. By comparison, the influenza mortality rate averaged over past few seasons was 0.1%."
"The CDC is recommending that older people with pre-existing health problems consider postponing their trip to Italy. The CDC site says: ""Older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel."" These conditions include heart disease and diabetes amongst others. It's your choice. While you are in Italy, there is no guarantee that you will be able to return easily to the US as flights could be cancelled at any time and you might even be isolated when you get back. Consider if you want to spend your whole vacation worrying about that or if you have the time to spare if that happens."
"The disease is confined largely to northern Italy. Please be aware of this parallel discussion thread. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…TripAdvisor have ‘pinned’ these two discussions at the top of the Italy forum.Edited: 11:10 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"The vulnerability of older people and their health status is central to the varied incidence of mortality. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547668/That is why there is such concern about COVID-19 taking off in the DPRK... North Korea has shut itself in even more than usual but there is a 1000km mountainous border and general malnutrition. Similar concerns in Iran and now in Afghanistan. While fogeys like me (76 and multiple health issues) are targets, we are not alone in succumbing and we can just note that it is the lively gadabout young who are super spreaders, as in Italy and ROK. With infection before symptoms it’s very hard to identify such people. At the outset emergency departments became disease foci in Lombardy. Staff thought they were dealing with ordinary flu at the outset. I don’t have figures for now, flu is on the decline reportedly, but in the third week of January half a million new flu cases were reported in Italy. COVID-19 a very small nasty needle in that haystack. And yes, we probably won’t do this. https:/…basic-start-of-blog.htmlI have another document with expenses so far and last dates when cancellation possible. Not yet. And in the prospect of cancellation our hearts go to the victims of cancellation. Need for empathy. There is a popular misconception that Italy’s earnings are mainly from tourists. In reality the percentage of GDP from tourism is similar in US, UK, Italy, a bit above 10%. Italy is a member of the G7, a research and design powerhouse, and that is whacked especially by the mess made now of supply chains, hopefully briefly, around Milan... just as for the supply chains between mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, ROK, Japan. All these also battered by the undermining of global trade harmony since 2017. .Edited: 11:41 pm, February 26, 2020 "

"Indeed. There are cases now emerging all over the place, including within the US, and it is likely that most countries have hundreds of undiagnosed cases by now. The cases hitting the news today caught it a week or two back, AND have bothered to go get tested, and waited for the results.Soon it won't be a question of where you are going, but of your underlying risk - which is a composite of your age, your general health, and your behaviour.People who aren't old or ill and who behave sensibly (avoid mixing with crowds, wash your hands, don't touch your face etc.) will be no more at risk when travelling than when going to work or meeting friends back home.Edited: 3:52 am, February 27, 2020 "
Corriere della Sera reports bars in Milan will be able to open later In the evening and museums will open....BUT there is as yet no indication of such change at the website of the Lombardy Government.
Ian #256...and avoid contact with parents etc?
"#256Ian, I see you have written similarly in other discussion threads. We are encouraging people to provide links to sources of factual information. Some of what you are writing appears speculative. And ahead of the science. And ahead of or apart from fact. “It is likely that...” is speculative."
Informative thread and I see the hyperbole is starting to be replaced with sound educated statements. I agree with Ian and for what he has said is not speculative as it supported by the various reports out there.Again as I have posted we all need to take into account that unfortunately this is a novel virus which many of us will never know we have it. I will be in Rome at the end of March enjoying my first visit. I had more of chance yesterday wiping out diving in the snow than getting deathly ill. Oh and here is my supportive link:https:/…coronavirus-asymptomatic.htmlBut I still like the one from the Atlantic better:https:/…
"Since I last posted, I have come from a briefing I have had originating from the UK health service, via my local primary care network.The view is that the outbreak can't be contained, and the measures being taken are about buying time for the virus to mutate into a less harmful form and/or for a vaccine to be developed and produced, and also about spreading the peak on health services so that they don't collapse under the pressure.The doctor we met said that the virus is sufficiently similar to ordinary flu that we can expect it not to like hot weather. Explaining why, as far as we can tell, areas like Indonesia and Africa don't appear to have serious problems. This means that the real crisis may well be when the virus re-emerges next winter, rather than this summer.It also means that if you are travelling from somewhere cool to somewhere hot, you'll be safer when away (noting the risk of travel).He also said that the preliminary conclusion is that adult men are at significantly more risk of catching the virus than women or children.Also worth noting that the average risk of dying in any year is already about one in a hundred, varying significantly with health and age. Even in the worst case global pandemic scenario, our personal risk of death only increases by something between 20% and 40%. So, on average, still less than one in sixty.Edited: 6:29 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Everything is speculative right now - since the experts don't know, there aren't any links to ""proven facts"". Anyone linking to the internet is linking to someone else's speculation.That said, the post I have just made comes via a health professional and is based on latest assessment of the UK NHS, as I have understood it."
"I contacted my landlady in Milan - I am booked for early May - she says that life is going on, no catastrophe. She is a painter, and as a creative person I could expect he would be worried more than anyone else.

Hope to see La Scala after all :))"

"The Governor of the Lombardy Region (capital city Milan) stated this afternoon that DECISIONS WILL BE MADE TOMORROW OR SATURDAY concerning the current restrictions imposed within the region.There is a fair likelihood that some restrictions will be either lifted or loosened. For example, the closure of all museums, which the Mayor of Milan has exhorted be dropped.Lombardy has already lifted the ban on keeping pubs, bars and night clubs closed after 6 p.m. The ban lasted only two nights, and currently these locations may remain open at night provided that capacity controls be respected, and that all patrons be served at table and not while standing at the bar counter (where people tend to congregate).I WILL POST RELEVANT UPDATES WHEN AVAILABLE."

I’m planning to travel from Tuscany by train via Milan Centrale to Tirano to start the Bernina Express journey from there in a couple of weeks’ time. I’m hearing reports of a deserted Milano centrale but none of cancelled trains . Any advice on the best place to find updates.
thank you for taking the time to post this. It was kind. Grazie~
I'm guessing at this point you must have cancelled. I live in Venice. Many places are closed. This is not the best time to be coming here.
I have a trip on April 6th for one week. Watching closely.
We had to cancel one reservation in Tuscany because the deadline to not lose our money is tomorrow. We are still waiting to see how things progress for the end of April. Hoping it will not be too bad. I know we are all in the same dilemma! Best of luck to everyone in making decisions on what to do!
All fine in Rome. Coronavirus is not present in the city Rome and region Lazio.

"Number to call if you are concerned about your symptoms or contact with virus [if you are in Italy]Throughout Italy people are being asked not to go to family doctor or hospital emergency department... but to make a phone call.The Veneto Region has a very clear page of advice on this. It gives a number to call which is specific for the Veneto region, other regions other numbers (I think). For other regions see region information in the official information thread.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…=====This is the Veneto regional government's advice.[google translation, using Chrome browser][there is a reference to 118, which is the national number for emergency]800462340. This is the toll-free number activated by the Veneto Region to assist and inform citizens on the behaviours to be taken by people who fear having come into contact with viruses.The decision was made in light of the fact that many people are calling 118 to inquire about the infection, to avoid overloading the operations centers, which can have consequences for rescuing people who actually need immediate intervention.It is also recommended to call 118 in case of breathing difficulties, to request the immediate sending of an ambulance.The technicians of the Region specify that people who fear having come into contact with infected subjects, but who have no symptoms or who have mild symptoms such as fever and / or cough without breathing difficulties, must not call 118 and must not go to Hospital; instead, they must contact the toll-free number which, based on the news reported, will provide all the information and any instructions on the behavior to be adopted. In addition, users can also request information and instructions from their general practitioner.The general practitioners of the Veneto region can be contacted by telephone by their clients who perceive symptoms, and who therefore do not have to go to the clinic. The doctor will perform a telephone triage and decide whether it is necessary to make a home visit or activate the intervention of the public hygiene service or the emergency-urgency system."
"The US CDC just updated Italy to Level 3. They are stating ""that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.""https:/…coronavirus-italy"
"This is REALLY BAD new. Unless the threat level is reduced pretty soon, the tourist season for Italy is finished for much of 2020. There will be thousands of workers out of a job in Italy.I have to question the sagacity of this action."
"I am very surprised by CDC raising the level to 3- which is the same level as traveling to China, and S.Korea.I was feeling hopeful and i still am. But this announcement sets me back a little. Watching closely as i have a trip to Florence end of March!"
"This was inevitable before US moved to recommend avoiding travel to Italy. Austria, Croatia, Greece, Switzerland and Algeria in Africa received persons infected in Italy. If the virus can spread from Italy to so many countries there is no reason it would not spread North America. Many companies have banned official travel to Italy, not just Northern Italy. It will be devastating for Italy from a tourism perspective, but Italy is much more than tourism and a G5 economy. So it should bounce back soon. I look forward to visiting Rome some time in 2021 or later.

"I think the most important line in the CDC statement is this:""There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.""The same statement surely applies to other countries where this gets a grip.

"Top exec,The nature of the virus is that it is carried by travelers, so the CDC warning recognizes that tourists move around a lot and end up encountering each other at various points in their journey, even when the started out in opposite places. If you go to the Trevi fountain, the people standing around you may have just come from northern Italy. If you go to the seacoast, it might be that some of the people staying at your hotel are northern Italians on a winter break. Italy is interconnected by trains, and many Italians living in the north have family in the south. Right now some Italian towns in the north have been isolated, and the 50,000 people who live there are not allowed to travel. Most Italians have decided not to travel within Italy right now unless it is absolutely necessary."
"Kirsten, your age puts you into a very high risk category for serious complications from the virus. I recommend that you avoid travel to Italy until the situation poses less risk to you."
"This is all unforeseen. Life is full of the unforeseen. I expect others have experienced the unforeseen. We address new crises small or large, in our lives, generally the same way as we have addressed crises in the past.We can pretend, we can protest, we can march forward or stay home. For myself, I am not finished with life, if possible. I am 76, I have previously had pneumonia, 1949, 1969, 1979, I have respiratory and other problems, I take prednisone which weakens the immune system. I am the classic target. I won't travel ...at least for now.  I also know that if we eventually can go to Italy, the amount of money down the drain in total will of course be more than cost of any cancellations now. There's a slightly weird logic in needing to spend more because we've already spent. Some of the young in these forums are saying that this thing is only bad for old people. May their mothers never kiss them again (too dangerous). It's true that those who are older and with pre-existing conditions are most vulnerable. Noting that the major spreader of this in Italy is very fit, 38, a marathon runner, never been to China; he and his wife gravely ill. My will is up to date, has been kept up to date for a long time. Be aware that the greatest rise in the position of lawyers in European society was in the 1300s when plague produced a large number of cases without wills and a big reduction in the number of lawyers. Supply and demand!We have to be ourselves, and make our own decisions."
"@303 It is. The point is that there are by now undiagnosed cases everywhere - particularly in the US which is beset by a struggling test program and fragmented health services. Travelling to an area where it is known there are hundreds of cases is obviously a risk.Travelling to somewhere like Rome, of course there is a greater risk than if you stay locked in your house, but no greater risk than if you are in London or New York or Los Angeles."
"Hi,Train ticket refundsAny one filled refund webform for cancelling nonrefundable ticket due to coronavirus at https://reclami-e-suggerimenti.trenitalia.com/rimborsi/(S(2wwmac3strejp1zw2rpm30d3))/en/Anagrafica.aspx ?and got reply from Trenitalia stating your refund request has been processed (not autogenerated email on submission of request)? or is it better to fill this form physically and email them?https:/…rimborso_dpr_coronavirus_en.pdfI got only auto generated email in which they mentioned they will get back to us within maximum of 30 days.

"I'm in the same situation as some of you, we planned a Sicily trip in late May-Early June. I am very surprised the CDC issued this alert to the ENTIRETY of Italy. Not sure what we will do as I am pregnant and have a 1yo daughter, but seeing as though I live in NYC and there are currently 8,000 people being tested for coronavirus in long island, I would think going to Rome-FCO and then PMO airports are no more dangerous than being where I am right now.."
The fact that there is a travel warning for Italy and there isn't one for New York City should tell you that there is a difference in the situations. There are several cases of coronavirus in European countries where travelers to Italy took the virus back home with them. There are no such cases that I know of where someone who traveled to NYC returned back home with the virus.
"Dennis, At some point the Italian government may ask for proof that travelers seeking entry to the country do not have respiratory problems because the health care system cannot care for foreigners who become sick here. Public authorities will have the full support of Italians in this, as they should. No one will think it is entirely your decision to impose burdens on the Italians."
"@313 ""No one will think it is entirely your decision to impose burdens on the Italians.""Exactly....Italy and any other country in same situation needs to #1 look out for their own population and care for them. If this continues borders and airports will have to close and governments will have to make the decisions for the benefit of their people. People from Northern Italy have certainly been in contact with those from the South and with the extended incubation period the next days will tell if this becomes widespread in the south. I hope the Italian medical authorities have better access to reliable testing kits than seems to be the case here in USA."
"So sad to be canceling our family trip to Italy. We were set to leave March 26. I have been holding out to wait and see what happens but with the new travel advisory thinking I might have to accept reality. We spent about $500 on trenitalia tickets all around Northern Italy. Milan-Venice, Venice-Parma, Parma-Monterosso, Monterosso-Varenna, Varenna-Milan. It is my understanding that the refunds have to be in the Lombardy region? Should I try to get each leg refunded even if the final destination is not in Lombardy? If we are not going to get our money back I might just want to sit on the tickets. Hold out hope for one more week. If we could get a travel credit on Trenitalia there is a chance we could try to reschedule our tickets for later in the year and use it then.American Airlines is only offering to waive cancellation fees through March 15 so we are waiting on that as I’m guessing it is likely to change. If it were already an option I might change our flight to a new destination/plan since we will already be out for our school holiday and have work time off scheduled. But where to go, it might just have to be home :("
@315 yes holding steady given your dates is the smart move...I think it will be extended and your dates would be in the next batch. As for the train if there is a possibility that you might reschedule the trip for summer in the hopes this will be contained by then? It sounds like much work went into a detailed itinerary...all involved might be willing to move your dates and not lose anything? But again another week won't make a difference in anything other than the awful feeling of uncertainty. Not sure I would plan anything international for your dates given the situation but just my opinion. This is going to move from country to country if experts are correct.

@318 thanks for that link...of course they will put a good spin on it...but honestly I do think some of the reactions to this ie US Level 3 for entire country may be a bit drastic...I guess time will tell. That said Rome is a very international city and would be surprised if more cases don't appear at medical facilities.
"State department now at level 4 as of this am 2/29Bad for all with plans and tickets, worse for Italy travel industry"
"#313""At some point the Italian government may ask for proof that travelers seeking entry to the country do not have respiratory problems because the health care system cannot care for foreigners who become sick here.""So, on trains from Switzerland to Italy (stopping at the border) people will be asked for evidentiary proof that they, or close relatives, have no history of asthma to any degree, no history of smoking, no history of allergies, and luggage will be searched for any devices for sleep apnea etc, have no health status incriminating medication in their baggage, any evidence that they are not pure according to some profile?... and what to do? Escort them off the train, send them to the WHO in Geneva perhaps? Or pass them to a modern inquisition?You are foreseeing radical changes, new levels and types of discrimination. We personally do not travel out of our country without health insurance to cover medical expenses where we are going. Will you require presentation of health insurance documents before entry? We historically carried standard international vaccination certificates (historically with stamps for cholera, typhoid, smallpox, TB and more). Should these be required again. In particular should anyone be allowed to travel anywhere without flu vaccination? Should there be a health intelligence test to measure whether people are traveling unprotected? Should flu vaccine be mandatory at home? In what countries is there any rule on having flu vaccineI spoke of individuals making their own decisions because I was asked by another person for advice. To encourage others not to do as they are told, but think.In fact the profile of risk involves primarily age but also doing a lot of travel, sweating and going to a lot of parties and entertainments. Perhaps profile for that, issue everyone with a card not for free coffee after five events but stay home after five parties. Perhaps also you should ban the habit in Europe of greetings and farewells with kisses on cheeks. Handshaking and kissing only to occur adjacent to and after using sanitizing wipes and washes. A tax levy to cover the extraordinary cost and environmental impact of more and more people using single use space suits to manage disease. Inspectors to ensure tissues and wipes in homes are isolated and not commingled in organic waste. There are many new employment opportunities in all this to offset losses in employment from tourist numbers falling and supply chains being disrupted.

"CNN and NYT reported that VP Pence announced today (29 February) even stronger travel restrictions for those traveling from Iran, South Korea and Italy. Department of state is yet to update their website, but it seems more like a Level 4 (do not travel). Here is the actual quote from CNN: ""Pence said the administration, through the US State Department, would increase the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level, advising American not to travel to specific regions in those countries."""

"From the Saturday email of Corriere della Sera of Milan. https://www.corriere.it/QUOTE [google translation, minor correction by me]After a week of health emergency in our country the picture has become clearer: in 90% of cases the virus does not give problems, says Vittorio Demicheli, Unit epidemiologist crisis L0mbardia Region , in the interview to our Simona Ravizza, but the real goal is to slow the contagion, and this can only be achieved through a reduction of contacts.That is why the infection outbreak regions, namely Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia, are on track to extend by another week the suspension of schools .Suspension and not closed, because while children will stay home, headmasters and teachers will be able to go to school and from there organize themselves to alternative forms of educational activities online or at a distance. Regions that last week had decided prior closure, however, Piedmont and Liguria, should reopen.Meanwhile it was approved the first decree with measures to support the areas and sectors affected , including a halt to all payments of bills and installments of mortgages in the eleven municipalities of the red zone, but also a number of benefits for tourism businesses, including hotels. And a second decree to help the economy of the whole country is expected next week.Edited: 3:36 pm, February 29, 2020 "
Our trip is mid June on a med cruise coming in a little before and staying a little after and since it is so far away we are waiting until closer to see what happens.

@327 I had a thread closed down here on TA because I reported the Level 4 change. I guess people don't want the facts to mess with their plans and so question the facts. All media sources are reporting this...which translated means Milan and Venice are in the Level 4 area and at least US citizens will be going at their own risk I guess.
The state department issued the travel ban to Italy to level 3 and & for Lombardy and Veneto but is there an expiration date or do we have to assume its for the next few months?
"@330 usually with these warnings no given expiration date...sort of on until they decide to take it off...I am sure there is extreme pressure by the affected areas to have authorities reevaluate often as this is going to really impact the entire country financially...especially Venice and Milan.Edited: 5:20 pm, February 29, 2020 "
This is not the Black Death. Take a look at the extremely low percentage of deaths among those who contract the virus. Relax
"The travel advisories are to protect the citizens of the country, in this case the US. This is to avoid travelers going to affected areas and bringing back the virus and spreading to vulnerable people who might not have the required level of immunity to survive. It is not about Italy or China or their economy. But I do feel bad for those in the tourism and hospitality business in Italy, South Korea and China. I do hope things improve there. But after we cancelled we are not planning to book again for a year or more. I have been put off from traveling until there is a vaccine for this. I am in my 60s and do not want to take any risks. Tourism involves going to crowded areas and has a higher chance of catching disease/viruses during epidemics."
"No question that there will be massive political and governmental pressure to modify this latest travel advisory: a ""no travel"" advisory for Lombardy and Veneto is a death sentence for Italy, and not just for Milan and Venice (and Verona, Padova, Vicenza, etc.). Plus, I assume that some airlines will stop flying to Milan, Venice and other airports in the affected regions, at least the US airlines. Better keep checks on Delta, United and American (and maybe even Air Canada and others)."

"For me the most important news from Washington DC is that they plan to start screening passengers, and said that the US and Italy would work together on what that screening will be.I predicted this earlier and was met with a barrage of sarcastic comments --- it's ok, people are tense. But the screenings are likely to be more than just a temperature check. You will be probably be asked a lot of questions about where you went and your overall state of health before you are allowed to board a plane.It would make medical sense to take a temperature check of passengers leaving Italy once before they board the plane and again, 8 hours later, when the plane lands. Virus symptoms sometimes develop within a single day. So passengers might face 2 possibilities of being detained, even if it later proves they don't have the virus.Finally, things like this are negotiated between countries, and politics does come into it. Few countries will be happy with one-sided screening -- meaning, if Italians must submit to being screened before going to the US, then Americans must be screened to get on a plane to go to Italy. I will add that the fact that all of Italy was not put under ""Level 4"" may have been the result of political negotiations (but it will mean a lot more questioning, I think, at airports about itineraries)The 2 countries must come up with these new screening procedures very fast -- given the ongoing spread of the virus in both countries -- which means the first set of procedures for screening might change very quickly. to something more restrictive or intrusive or something less. So this is an incredibly dynamic situation in which no plans can be considered final.Edited: 7:15 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Added thought:It's possible that some airports that now accept non-stop flights from Italy will no longer do it, to avoid setting up these screening procedures, not to mention having to deal with the possibility of a plane landing that has carried a coronavirus carrier.what a mess!Edited: 7:25 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Well don't worry about the US, since the state of Washington is under a state of emergency. And according to WHO, China has stabilized. Now the country that you should be concerned with is the US since I doubt very much the National Guard will shut down all state boarders and enforce a quarantine such as Italy did in their northern regions. And as of today only 472 people in the US have been tested.And that is directly from the CDC.gov website. How many people have been tested in Italy? According to Worldometer as of Feb 26 nearly 10000 people there. In South Korea 66,000+ test, And in Austria there have been nearly as many tested with slightly over 300+. Hell the CDC refused to initially test the patient who had an unknown origin of infection. Be prudent, be smart, and most of all take care of yourself. The US has 50% of its population that are not fit and healthy. And I apologize for being on my soapbox, but this virus doesn't care who you are and it will be global according to WHO."

"Not minimizing, but if you do look at the John Hopkins Live Coronavirus map the chart does demonstrate a leveling off in China.

There was a bump at one point in the statistics for Wuhan when method of recording was changed.

"The bottom line is that the US isn't doing testing, to any significant level (less than 500 tests, total, compared to over 1,000 a day in many European countries), and therefore no-one can say how risky the situation in Italy or other affected countries is, compared to the US.Edited: 3:57 am, March 01, 2020 "
"While it is true because that the lack of widespread testing in the US makes it impossible to compare the level of risk there to the level of risk anywhere else, it is still the case the raw number of sick people in hospitals in Italy being treated for coronavirus is an obvious indicator of af an outbreak large enough to be a threat to anyone in the vicinity, and anyone using the same public transport links or having people from the most affected areas circulating among those in less affected areas. You don't need to wait for testing to know that.I was reading in the Wall St Journal yesterday that even Italians are wary of free movement inside the country. The article quoted a woman in Ischia -- which you all probably know is an island -- taking a very dim view of northern Italians visiting the south at this moment. The article mentioned some people thought passengers arriving on flights from Milan to southern cities should be screened before boarding lights. I do not thing that will happen (nor on trains) but just sharing it to show you how seriously people are taking this, and how much they don't want the virus to be spread by travelers.Edited: 9:39 am, March 01, 2020 "
not sure what result they expect if people are moving freely from north to south? I agree with the woman but without actually shutting borders down (as in China) not sure how to really enforce anything. @358 your country must be really on high alert with the borders etc.
"Donald Trump has tweeted:In addition to the 'before boarding' checks from certain designated high risk countries or from certain areas of those countries, travelers will also be checked on arrival in America"":What this means is that when the plane lands, if any passenger on the flight is showing symptoms of the virus, it will have some impact on all passengers on that flight and the flight crew."
They will need to do more than that...a quick study of this virus indicates people can be completely asymptomatic and incubation is long some report up to 21 days...most 14 days or less. Will need protocol that if someone is diagnosed they can then contact each and every passenger etc.
"geneI was also reading that at least one region of Italy, Basilicata, said it would bar people from the northern regions from coming there -- but then I never read anything more about it.  As an government decree, I can't see any way that could be enforced -- massive checkpoints on highways? Making all train passengers produce residence IDs? It surely is possible for the smaller islands to close their ferry terminals -- but most of them still want tourists to come (just only uninfected tourists!)As a cultural matter, I can imagine how strong pleas from the unaffected regions to please not travel into the region might be respected by Italians in the affected regions. In fact, many people are already behaving that way. there are some regions of Italy that don't have any cases at all and it would help everybody if it stayed that way."
"What I have clearly understood about the virus is that healthy people have low or no chance of dying by it. What worries me is health of elderlies and people with immunosuppressive diseases. For these people, but for these people alone, I believe the less contacts we have, the better.This means that avoiding travelling is perhaps the smartest thing to do at least until a vaccine can be found, able to safeguard lives of categories at risk.For this reason, avoiding travels does not only mean travelling in the strict sense, but also avoiding all contacts and all movements even within the own town.Unfortunately, to date, our way of life has allowed us to travel up to three or more different continents in a single day.This means that it is not true that if you do not go to a country at risk, you are safe. It is possible to catch the virus only by going to the market or to buy the newspaper because the person next to you has just returned from the other side of the world or has a relative who has done so.In addition, the virus is asymptomatic for at least 14 days but is already contagious. Are we sure that our neighbours or the florist where we just bought the flowers is not infected?Who can say it?Is it useful to ban travelling to countries at risk? It certainly reduces risk but do not eliminate.If you came from a country pretending not at risk and you go anywhere in the world, are you safe? What's the difference for the virus if you go to Rome, London, Beijing New York or elsewhere? Not to say that when you are back home you might have compromised the previously safe area where you are from.Then? What to do? Use common sense, wash your hands and reduce contact with categories at risk until a vaccine is ready.Travelling? I believe in a month or two we will have the answer. In the meantime probably a ban is not the best solution."

"""A travel ban does help reduce the risk and buys critical time. Imagine people in Wuhan can freely travel all over the world.""I understand your point and let me say I agree. The reason Chinese Government imposed the quarantine in the Wuham region is exactly what it was supposed to be done.Now, Beijing. Are any known cases in Beijing? Makes it sense to isolate the whole China?And in Italy? The first two cases in Italy were a couple of retired chinese spouses in Italy for vacations. They travelled all over Italy before to stop in Rome manifesting the first virus symptoms. They have been isolated one month ago and, thankfully, they fully recovered. We thought to be safe because no other positive cases was manifested in Rome. And none at present, to my knowledge, apart people hospitalized in Spallanzani Hospital, the Italian excellence center for viruses and tropical diseases.Then Codogno, near Milan, where a 38 YO man was the first unaware spreader, apparently who never had been to China, but only had a dinner with a chinese engineer, resulted later negative to virus. Where the man, known as Patient One, has contracted the virus from Patient Zero in not given to know because nobody knows who the latter is. We all though the chinese engineer was the Patient Zero, but he had no virus. What happened? Nobody knows but Codogno has been completely isolated by the rest of the world following the procedure the Chinese Government adopted in Wuhan.By the time I am writing there are 67 countries and territories in the worldometers list count, USA included where has been reported the very first unfortunately decease. Hopefully not, but are you confident that what happened in Codogno will not happen anywhere else?Many countries like Japan, Germany and France are reporting growing positives at a very worrying rate. What Shall we do? Do you still believe a travel ban is a solution?"
"Please note, the restrictions are for Lombardy and Veneto ONLY."
"Do be careful about rumour and excited statistics. This is a very new situation. When you had a second child you could issue a notice that “our infant production increased by 100% overnight”. Not only are there new cases but if you think cases of anything there will always be a lag in recovery information because, um, it takes time to recover."
We can pretty much assume patient zero were the Chinese couple. They spread their sickness and someone they came in contact with spread it to the 38 year old. It's already all over Italy. But it's subclinical. Obviously this is not as serious as the press is making it

"I did my graduate work in Epidemiology. Coronavirus is overblown. More fear than fact. Please try not to feed the fear.Fact 1) the death rate in developed countries with extensive testing is extremely low. South Korea has fallen under .5%. the reason for the phantom heightened rate elsewhere in the developed world is due to the fact that A) they aren't testing extensively. (E.g. the us is not testing extensively.. it's probably pretty wide spread here already) There are MANY subclinical cases that simply go unreported. Thus the denominator in those countries is much lower than it should be, bringing the rate up. B) many of the mortality in those countries is the result of people who have died of other causes but happen to test positive for covid-19. Italy is the best example of this. Direct Corona related deaths are 4 or 5, but 21 people who have died tested positive. This includes terminal cancer patients and others.Fact 2) Wuhan China has an elevated rate because A) China has an inadequate healthcare system and they were not able to respond as a developed country would. B) The rate in Wuhan is 2.3%. the rest of China is low at .7 or .4% depending on the cohort.As a result, the level of alarm is unwarranted and people should not get caught up in the hysteria.There is no doubt that this will come here and a lot of people will get it. But it will be mild so people will just think they have a cold. However, if you have an autoimmune disease or a pre-existing respiratory condition, certainly be careful, as you would for flu or anything else.Cheers"

"I believe is time to give informations about the situation in Italy from the inside.I live in Abruzzo, in the center, on the Adriatic sea, on the coast opposite to Rome. Close from where I live, in Pescara and Pineto, there are two confirmed positive cases. The life is the same as it was before the knowledge of the virus. Last night I went out to dinner with my spouse as we usually do on saturdays. I called ten restaurants before to find one with a free table for us. In the afternoon we went to the market to buy food for short term use, as we usually do on saturdays. Everything was waiting for us on the shelves except masks and hand sanitizer. Nobody was wearing a mask. Where are all masks gone? No idea, but I believe people had clean hands.At two o'clock am I went to Pescara to get my daughter and a friend of her whom went to a party for an 18th birthday. The traffic of the movida was the usual chaotic traffic, plenty of people around doing their usual life.Those are news from Chieti. To my knowledge everywhere else is the same, except, obviously, for the quarantined zones.About QZ, we have a cousin living in Codogno. She talk to phone to my wife reporting empty streets, very few people around, but they are fine. The problem is not physical but psychological (Read link below. Sorry. In Italian)https:/… On the Italian TA forum we have a topic where we report to others what is ours life and if anything has changed due to virus.

"The head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency said the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the virus had jumped to 1,694 from 1,128 on Saturday, virtually all of them coming to light since Feb. 20 in the worst such contagion in Europe.Of that number, 83 people had fully recovered, while 140 patients were in intensive care. The vast majority of those who have tested positive have few, if any symptoms.Around 90% of all cases are concentrated in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The government has ordered that schools and universities must remain closed there for a second week, with large public gatherings still banned in an effort to halt the contagion.As the human toll grows, the government is increasingly worried about the economic outlook. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri announced the cabinet would approve this week 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of measures to help companies.This came on top of an aid-package worth 900 million euros that was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted zones.https://www.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-death…"

"See intelligent commentary at Corriere della Sera. Statistics view guardedly. Of course with increased surveillance there are more diagnoses. Of course it takes time for people to be recovered so obviously the graph line for diagnosis is way above the recovery. Of course nobody gets defined as recovered until doctors are very sure. Across the hospitals 4-5% are in intensive care, 10-20% need hospital support for recovery. The great majority are in quarantena domiciliare, home quarantine (for which there are rules for isolation and hygiene within the home)So please, don’t just pile in these negative statistics."

We can just take Milan for September, but I was just looking forward -. If I cancel, does anyone know how to get the money back from Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper ?? which was booked months ago...."
"You might want to read the post I just put up in the thread for official information about the coronavirus. People over 65 who live in Lombardy -- which includes Milan -- are being advised not to leave their homes at all for 2 or 3 weeks. That is because the nature of the virus is that people over 65 are more likely to need to be hospitalized than younger people if they catch it. The announcement also said that it is true that the virus is now widespread in Lombardia. I have read that officials who re-open museums and other public attractions are saying that they will insist all visitors stay 2 meters apart from each other, I don't know how that will be accomplished at venues like the Last Supper. I honestly don't think this is a moment to ""plan"" a trip to Italy because you can see, if you have been following the news, that every day something changes that requires making a new 'plan"". That will be true for the foreseeable future., It is a crisis, an unknown crisis.Do you really need a refund for your Last Supper tickets? Why not consider it a charity donation to the country at a time of extreme need."
the spacing of people in museums will probably not be that difficult given there will no doubt not be many visitors...but if there are higher numbers sound very difficult to enforce...and people are still touching things...restrooms...rails etc. Just leaving them closed seems like a better plan and not risking health of your workers too.
This article is not accurate. The author is taking the opinion of a single individual with regard to it's virulence over the flu. I will be linking a measured survey of multiple studies shortly.
Here is a better article than the one from the guardian which is showing undue panic. https:/…
"There are so many voices speaking about the virus. The following is the voice of one of the most known virus scientist. Her studies on Sars were revolutionary. She is living in United States and she is Director at Florida Universityhttps://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilaria_Capuahttps:/…Google translatedCoronavirus is much less lethal than we fearedThe virologist Ilaria Capua exclusively for Fanpage.it: the virus has been circulating for weeks, if not months, in Italy. And of this we must consider ourselves lucky: because it means that it is less lethal than we fear it will be. And that we have lived with it for some time without any particular problems. That's why maybe we should be less scared than we are now.The flu-like syndrome caused by Coronavirus has now reached several Italian regions and resulted in four deaths. Indeed, let's face it: it was the cause of some deaths. There is little to be optimistic about, you say. True, but this does not mean that you have to stop looking at things from the right perspective.First reflection. Italy seems to be one of the countries with the highest number of infections. Here: I am convinced that several European countries have Coronavirus cases that will be diagnosed in the coming days. This aspect will also be clarified in the coming weeks, as well as the actual extension of the infection in Italy. Perhaps, most trivially, we have diagnosed more and earlier.Perhaps, second reflection, we got there before the others. And in this sense, the dates and the number of deaths must make us think. Personally, I am increasingly convinced that the infection in Veneto and Lombardy circulated before the first death, at least for twenty days. What is certain is that the virus was not parachuted onto Vo Euganeo with a drone. Common sense tells us that the infection has been circulating in that area for weeks, maybe a few weeks, if not a few months. The same applies to the Lombard triangle between Codogno, Casalpusterlengo and Castiglione d’Adda.Third reflection: why did we not notice his presence in the previous weeks? The answer will surprise you: luckily we didn't notice his presence. The more the number of infected people grows - or rather: the more we discover previous and unnoticed cases - the better it is. Because it means that the number of infected is greater than we thought. And the lethal potential of the virus, much less.If this is so - fourth reflection - it means that its presence, in the past few weeks, has been in the vast majority of cases unable to provoke a disease worthy of being brought to the attention of doctors. Or, when it was brought to the attention of Italian doctors, it was treated by Italian doctors exactly as it was treated by Chinese doctors. I mean, they thought it was flu.Fifth reflection. I do not feel like excluding that even today there are several people who have become infected with Coronavirus. All of our humanity and empathy go to them, and to all the others who come. Making someone a greaser is chilling from a human and professional point of view. Doing it in the presence of a virus that can hide very well, behind traditional flu, is even more so."

"#425Gene, what can be done in San Marino cannot be done in Northern Italy. San Marino is a State within a State. It means that all the San Marino borders are within Italy. Is a very small territory not under the Italian law.It is in Italy, near Rimini, but is not Italyhttps://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_MarinoIn Europe there are other territories like San Marino.

"South Korea is far away but lumped with Italy in COVID-19 news. This is a useful analysis by a reputable source in Seoul of the way the virus there has been concentrated in and spread from a particular church community (the source of a US forces infection in the city of Daegu where there is aUS base and churchgoing soldiers). Towards the end the point that authorities are focused on circumstances where people remain for ten minutes within a radius of two metres. The isolation of the disease to the Daegu area is as important as isolation of Wuhan or the 11 towns of the zona rossa in Northern Italy. The objective of isolation being twofold, to see if the thing can die down and to gain time in working for solutions. …hani.co.kr/arti/…930749.html"
"To add to #426. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino…San Marino is on a hilltop and has a population of not much more than 30,000. Their main activity is wealth and money. At the time of the renaissance that was what was in the Italian peninsula. Small fortress states led, in northern Italy by businessmen who were good at fighting. A bit different from places further north in Europe where the entitled ran things more on the basis “I’ve got a horse, you haven’t”. It is a marvel that at the height of the renaissance the population of Florence was about the same as San Marino now, that several centuries of bossy merchants maintaining a tough republic brought from everywhere books and ideas. The explosion of the renaissance much more than cheeky art. Humbling that when the Medici lost power in Florence for a bit one of Lorenzo’s advisors by the name Nick Machiavelli lost his job, walked home to his wife and farm, in the morning fed the chickens, in the afternoon dropped in to the pub and in the evening dressed up in fancy courtier gear and wrote the most influential book on politics for the next five hundred years. Also not completely unusual that when Renzo grabbed back the top job in Florence again and Nick went back to court and Nick showed Renzo his book Renzo said naaah I don’t read books!Lots of biographies of Machiavelli out there. Pardon my plain language summary. Sometimes the quality academic prose hides the basic plain stories.Edited: 4:02 pm, March 02, 2020 "
thank you Dennis I am very aware of just where and what San Marino is.
"DennisYour post #427 is very meaningful because focuses on the real matter. The virus itself may or may not be dangerous according to the scientist speaking, but everyone agree that we do need to protect the categories at risk, the most exposed to the dangers.To do protect we need time and we can only gain time by reducing contacts one to each other. The article you shared is deeply right.Anyway, I don't believe a travel ban is a solution mostly because all 67 nations with active cases should be banned and that looks impossible. Then travelling is not only nation to nation but town to town or neighborhood to neighborhood.What looks instead possible is to isolate single territories adopting elsewhere all possible measures to riduce virus spread. I am aware, however, that such an effort requires everyone's collaboration, like hand washing using sanitizers, sneezing into the elbow, keeping distances one to the other, not shaking hands or hugs and else"
"gene,I follow many museum accounts on Twitter, and one museum in Venice announced that it would re-open but only allow people to enter on staggered entry, and that is was offering a large reduction in ticket price for the next 2 weeks to encourage people to look beyond the crisis and appreciate cultural richness.It's possible no one will show up, but if lots of people do, what is likely is a line of people outside the door waiting to get in -- rather defeating the purpose of keeping people apart. Or maybe they plan to give numbers and tell them to go elsewhere until they are texted -- like a bar?)What is desperately needed is an international commitment to see museums and the tourist industry through this crisis. People are giving too many incentives to travel when they should be sending a message: ""It's okay, stay home, we're staying home"" with enough gov't backing to make people not afraid they'll lose money if they say that.Edited: 4:56 pm, March 02, 2020 "

"Raffaele-- My position exactly at this moment. I am scheduled to arrive in Florence on March 26, then rent a car for a road trip in Tuscany for two weeks. When people asked me whether i am still going, i say I will make a judgement call a week (or days) prior to departure. Here in the States, hysteria has taken over. My concern (as with many travelers) is the airport situation with the possibility of canceled flights, changes, or long delay. It would pain me to core to have to cancel, but if I get to that stage, i will remember Dennis' advice - to act with empathy and accept partial refund and consider what Italy is experiencing right now. We also have tickets with Delta, their change policy is we must change our travel date within a year from original purchase date, which isn't that flexible at all. Many uncertainties but this forum is giving me a lot of peace to hear what everyone else is thinking. Tripadvisor has always been my #1 tool when planning trips. In the past, discussions were filled with excitement and joy. Now is mostly uncertainties, sadness, and just a bit of hope remains..."
"Cookie on #450Going by car you'll be fine but the matter is air travelling and borders to cross. You are correct about delays or cancelled flights.

"#453 Great post! We are all facing the same difficult issues.“the answers aren't here on any of this.”Actually the answers are all here. :-) If you want to be re-assured that you are not crazy/reckless for traveling right now during this outbreak you will find plenty of re-assurance here on the forums.Here is a first hand account of someone in Italy right now and not sick, here everything looks normal. Here is an article from a scientist saying this panic may all be overblown, urging us to stop the fear-mongering.If you are looking for reassurance that you are making the right decision not to travel, those answers are here as well. Couldn't be any clearer.CDC level 3 alert for Italy :”avoid non essential travel”State department level 3 for Italy: reconsider travelLevel 4 for Lombardy and Veneto ” Do not travel”And here you will also find links to articles from respected scientists saying that this could end up being just the beginning of the crisis.

Are you Not Getting a Refund due to the COVID-19 situation?Call your credit card company and explain the situation and that this is related to Italy or any other country that is part of the travel ban for Americans or your country of origin.We just did and the credit card company is refunding the $774.00 that was charged to our account on January 25 for a nonrefundable reservation.If the hotels don't want to be undestanding, hopefully your credit card company will.Ours said that ""given the circumstances, they will issue the refund within 7 days even if they cannot settle the dispute with the hotel""Refuse to be a victim. Good Luck!"
"Thank you, TravelLovers2, for your post. We were holding out hope that the State Dept and CDC would receive good news out of Italy and lower their levels in time for our March 21st Venice-Positano-Rome awesome trip, but sadly that is not happening so employer-mandated 14 day self-quarantine is guaranteed. Hoping I have the same success with non-refundable expenses incurred."
"I completely agree, I have a trip planned for May and am planning on going."
"Funny you should ask! We contacted the Trenitalia website and were told we had to send all our information by snail mail and it need to arrive by MARCH 1. Our flights were cancelled by our carrier on Feb 28! Needless to say it didn't get there in time from Australia. We rang therm in Italy - no help.Each booking had to be sent to a different station five in all. Cost AUD $24 in postage. Probably a complete waste of time. Already lost thousands and thousands as hotels are claiming they don't need to follow their cancellation policies as its safe in their region. Of course, travellers ..travel!! We can't go. Flights cancelled etc etc. Booked areas with positive cases. Nightmare! Never again. I am gutted. Good luck with your efforts."
"I hope you haven't prepaid for your hotels. They won't refund. Flights may but many are being cancelled and alternative flights don't fit with our bookings at all!If you are young and fit you will probably be ok. We are late 60s. No way were we going to risk it. We booked everything last July 2019. Still very few refunds. I hope if you cancel you are luckier than us. I know they are all having a terrible time too, but losing thousands and thousands of dollars is no fun"
"Rome is the city of water... it may only occur during the hottest months July, August but I cannot recall the shortage in Rome in past. This happens every year in Sicily and south of Italy though."
Just announced by Italian government - all schools and universities in all of Italy to close immediately until the middle of March - football authorities order Serie A football matches across Italy to be played behind closed doors and no spectactors
"correction: BBC now says Italy is considering closing, earlier it say Italian government was going to..."
"@462 not sure how you can blanketly say ""they won't refund"" when many have been flexible with people that have posted here and from personal experience they often will work with you. Postponing the booking is usually a good way to not lose the money."
"Anyone here currently visiting the major tourists sites like the Colosseum, Venice, Siena, etc...I'm curious what the crowds are looking like. I fly April 15 and will go regardless if my flight allows me...hope my flight won't cancel as half my bookings are non refundable .... think it will be very similar circumstances next month."

"Hello.I am an American currently in Italy with my partner. We came here yesterday and are traveling to Rome, Florence, and Naples until the 19th.We are both young with no serious medical history.In Rome, the environment is very casual. Everything is open, museums, restaurants, historical sites, all of it. Very few people are wearing masks, everyone is washing hands often. We have already met other travelers from the US and UK (even elderly) who are happy as clams because the crowds are extremely low for this time of year. I mean, 50 - 70 people at the Trevi at 8PM. We got up to the fountain and took multiple videos with no one else in the scene. Pretty unheard of. Same for the Colosseum, Foro Romano, Pantheon, etc. Restaurants are offering deals and reduced rates due to the drop in tourism. The weather is beautiful and quite warm. The Italian government is offering frequent and transparent updates about the situation. I would encourage anyone with travel anxiety to read non-English Italian sources primarily. We have found they give the most clear-eyed and pragmatic perspective. If you see an article with a headline photo of people crowding in face masks, please know this is not at all an accurate depiction of the environment, at least South of the hard-hit areas. The % of new cases daily is slowing, while the % of new recoveries is increasing. I am following this data on the ""Timeline of Coronavirus in Italy 2020"" Wikipedia page which has up to date and insightful breakdowns of the data. It is also important to note that people who died while having Coronavirus is not the same as people who died from Coronavirus. The mortality rate in less affected regions is much, much lower than in the hot spots. At this point, our biggest worry is the response from the US government regarding travel to/from Italy. We have contingency plans if we're somehow blocked from returning. Right now, this does not seem likely to us. But of course it is a very dynamic situation. Everyone is different. Do what is comfortable to you. We decided not to cancel and for us it has been a good choice after a day. But still 3 weeks to go. Hopefully members of this forum appreciate an ""American in Italy"" perspective. This thread has helped us immensely with information updates. Thank you all!"

"On post #481I am not an American travelling in Italy. I am an Italian living in Italy. About your post, it mostly describe life as it is now, generally normal, but there is something weird. If it was written by someone who wrote many post and an adequate number of reviews, not to say who posted a few pictures, it was going to be more believable. You joined TA on march 2020, while on vacation with your partner, hopefully spending a good time, only to post on a TA topic that in Italy everything is fine, giving the message to freely come in Italy?I am sorry, but even if for me everything is fine as usual, I don't believe it would be as normal as usual for a tourist. I am not saying not to come in Italy to spend your holidays, but if you do, consider that there are a few things to keep in mind.First of all delayed or cancelled flights. Second, eventuality to be ordered to stay under quarantine while in Italy on when back home from Italy. Third attractions, museums, churches and else might be closed.To prove life for an Italian is the same as usual, this morning I went to a food market because I was attracted by pasta and tuna offered at half price.We usually go on saturdays but the offer was too good not to change our habits. What I unusually did was to take pictures of the market shelves.I shared them on my profile, here:https:/…4396065 All around Pescara and Chieti, where I live, it's plenty of big food chains where you can buy really everything at a very good prices. I went to this small market to get the offers first but also for the higher quality given by the slightly higher prices.As you can see by the pictures, all the shelves are full of any goods, hand wash cream included. However I didn't find masks or hand sanitizer. Also prices are the same as usual. As you can see on the receipt, I spent most on pasta and tuna, the two offers I wanted to catch.Now, the message:On TV people are saying we should change our lifestyle for at least 30 days. We should stop shaking hands, hugging each other and avoiding to stay close to each other less than one meter.We might have a statistically low probability to be in trouble getting the virus, but a lot of people has not. The best is to wait as long as you can before to decide if you should go to the planned trip or not. Postponing might be a solution if adoptable. Only a few days or a few weeks might do. Who knows?It's not desirable to lose money but if you could lose more or being cause for others to lose more, then..."

Absurd that I have to stand up for myself to you all when I took time from my vacation to give what I intended to be a meaningful update. Believe what you want. I was courteous and respectful. Why would I come on here for the first time ever just to mislead you? Oh well. I will no longer post updates here as intended. Bye."
Exactly Tewkewi. I have been on other boards and pointing out that many people never had a clue they had a virus. What it interesting is the statistics showing young people not being as harmed as the elderly. Some discussion involves the natural bodily immune systems of the young https://www.livescience.com/why-kids-missing…What I have read is that if you have an underlying health issue and especially in the elderly you need to take more precautions.And unless my flight is cancelled my wife and I are going to Rome and Florence at the end of March.Heck are we going to stop flights to Seattle next? San Francisco?

"MKnKK - sorry you have been made to feel less than authentic than anyone else.There is a strange impulse by some to consider any new posters as not being real for some reason; Obviously, every single poster began with a first posting.Not that it matters but I didn't question your account at all (as all my friends in Rome are living their lives as usual (except for those with children) up until today so I had no reason to think your experience was not genuine) - I'm not sure why others did.Also sorry you felt you needed to actually prove it - what a shame.In any case - I hope you enjoy your stay and it is free of any difficulties or challenges. There are loads of posters with many posts and reviews who post a bunch of questionable nonsense but never get challenged about such posts - I've figured out who I choose to ignore on here - it's the only way, for me, that makes this forum useful.  I'm sure plenty of people ignore my posts as well; it is really no big deal given the anonymity of a worldwide forum, stuff like that is bound to happen.Good luck!

"The posts are gone so not sure what the issues are, but anyway.People currently in Italy I guess are having a good time, that was never my issue. The issue is getting back to the US.

Plus the thought of 150 people who have been in Italy who knows where for 12 hours....planes are one the worst Petri dish environments ever invented. I say no thanks. But it was taken out of my hands as our tour with Tauck was cancelled yesterday by them, we were going april 17. I am thankful they cancelled it."
"The issue is, obviously, that a new poster was made to feel like he was lying - Someone who offered up their own experience only to get hounded and called a liar - I'm guessing some posters may be feeling quite satisfied with themselves for running someone off of here. There are a myriad of reasons people are choosing to cancel or having their trips canceled for them - I'm sure it is disappointing however the cancelation occurs"

Kudos to people willingly sharing their experiences even at the first post and skeptycals, like me, are better to apologise, as I did."
"Not only that, MC, but the suggestion that MKnKK is not a native English speaker. Preposterous. The post is beautifully written with not a single spelling, grammar, or punctuation error. Hardly like posts of some American and British English contributors whose use of the language is cringeworthy. Seems to me that at least a few folks are caught up in the hysteria of the situation and must be getting a bit tired. Best to take a rest for the sake of us all."

Hopefully not if you are losing money2. to go anyway and take the risk. It's up to you. I don't feel I can suggest anyone to run the risk. It's not to get the virus itself, but to deal with delayes, cancelled flights and any possible order to stop in a quarantine area in Italy or when you'll fly back home. If you feel you can run the risk then you are welcome3. to postpone. Well. Anybody has a better idea?"

Yesterday they send the letter about ""how they respond to coronavirus"" saying that flight attendants will wear gloves when serving food and drinks, about HEPA filters on airplanes and AGAIN that for new bookings in March they will wave change fees, NOTHING about existing bookings.

#548 Diana. I don't think any airline is doing us any favors right now if trying to rebook an existing flight. My husband and I are scheduled to fly to Sicily with Delta on April 14. We can change our ticket without penalty but my current $1600 ticket will cost me $3700 if I schedule the same flights in October!! So for me it's wait to see if Delta cancels my flight at this point. Deborah
"547 & 548 We ran into the same issue with British Airways. They are running this ""Book with Confidence"" ad, touting no change fees for new bookings. But yet they would not let us rebook our flights to Rome unless we paid change fees of $450 a ticket. We asked to terminate in London and forgo our Rome leg - again just no. It's infuriating. With the loss of money on 5 tickets, we can't afford to rebook to Italy this year. They actually would have made more money if they let us rebook for the summer. We then would have spent money in Italy, helping their economy. It would have been a win for all. I'm keeping track of the airlines with these restrictive guidelines and won't be using them in the future. I understand the airlines are hemorrhaging money but at least give people some options during these exceptional times."

"This is a big dwal. Airlines will no doubt cancel all flights to these cities a d bologna Soon. Prior to Corona, our itinerary included a visit to a parmigiano and balsamic vinegar factory and lunch a Massimo bottura establishment, but we cancelled and will try to head straight to puglia depending on what the airline says."
I must say I would have a moral dilemma if I chose to still go ahead with any Italy trip right now. You could be adding to their burden should you get ill. It is naive to think the rest of the country is not affected.
"Evidently each situation brings about different results. If your re-booking window is very small since you purchased your tickets as soon as possible (April 2019 for travel in March 2020 for example) then you have little options to re-book for different dates since the expiration date for tickets cannot exceed one year plus 45 days - provided you request and get special consideration from the airlines. If your employment is also a limiting factor, such as being a classroom teacher who can only travel during school vacations, then your options become even more limited. But if you present your case with facts and not hysteria hopefully your outcome will be more acceptable. I presented my information in a concise, detailed way, and fortunately Delta Airlines listened and granted me a full refund. I was pleasantly surprised by the positive outcome; it did restore my faith that large corporations can act with reason and compassion. Now we hope to make it to Italy in March 2021 and we will purchase our flights from Delta."

"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/926089The whole episode is overblown out of fear stoked by the media. Swine Fu was worse with no hysteria, why? Honestly, this is to the point that this seems agenda driven."
"not sure what it will take for some traveling in the next month to see that this is simply not the time to go? @587 do you honestly think a country's government is closing major areas of their country off and closing museums etc. in the whole country, cancelling major events...taking a financial hit from which they may never recover because of media hype?"
"287 - The more I read up on the situation, the less I agree with your point of view. Italy is trying very hard to stop further spread because their health system is overwhelmed in the North and they don't want the same situation elsewhere. Time to be sensitive about the situation, and wait to travel until later. They closed down all museums in the country - maybe that's an incredibly clear sign they're not wanting tourists right now. Maybe we respect that."
I think the moves that the Italian officials have made are a pretty clear statement they don't want tourists now...some won't get the message...so be it. They will keep essential trains and flights going (at least for some days) so people can get in place not for tourists at all. Also depending on how this goes the zones can be expanded and the date of Apr 3 can be moved.

"""Since this is a forum where many countries are represented...is the US the only country that does not want flights from MXP and VCE?""No, absolutely not. I read today that from tomorrow, Hungary ordered to cancel all flights from Milan , Bergamo and Treviso. Most of the flights from Milan-Malpensa to Budapest were already cancelled anyway by the airline concerned."
"I'm supposed to go to Rome and Naples March 27, but it looks like I'll have to cancel. My country requests you self isolate for 14 days if you've been anywhere in Italy, and every time I have a negative border crossing experience it involves my country's people, so even though I'm not worried about Coronavirus, I am worried about not being able to get back home, or being quarantined and missing weeks of school. Plus, the place I live has multiple cases, so it's possible Italy won't want to let me in. Such as it is. No refunds, either. I don't have travel insurance, and even if I did, any of the policies I'd have bought exclude epidemics or pandemics."

"I am writing this in the early hours of March 9th. You have a wonderful trip planned, but this is the wrong year. Yes, you should cancel. Since you made reservations on your own, you might have trouble getting all deposits back, but the airlines fllying from the US should give you full credit. The alternative is to be prepared for a 14 day quarantine in Italy, should you become sick. Take lots of reading material on some sort of device. Maybe an easily packed craft, like knitting. Good luck."

"We have our honeymoon planned for travel to Milan May 21 and then to Lake Como, Cinque Terre, Florence, Positano and Capri, returning June 7th. We have until April 21 to cancel and receive a full refund from each hotel we have already pre-paid totaling over $30k. We have two first class tickets on Emirates from JFK to Milan we will also need to cancel. I see where Emirates is providing full refunds but only through travel booked till the end of March so we will have to await their revision of refund policies. My fear is our first flight on Delta airlines round trip from Orlando to JFK may not be so easy for refunds? This is a trying time for worldwide travelers. My brother-in-law is a drug scientist and states this Coronavirus will take at least one full year to get under control. He states it will retreat slightly in the summer and come back with a vengeance by next Fall/winter if there is no vaccine produced and distributed. A very scary time indeed. Three months ago I booked a cruise from Bali to Bangkok for February 2022. This might be our honeymoon trip depending upon how soon we can contain this virus?Edited: 7:59 am, March 09, 2020 "

"""My fear is our first flight on Delta airlines round trip from Orlando to JFK may not be so easy for refunds?""@Bob and Carla L, post #615I cancelled a trip to Malaysia (via Hong Kong airport) and got a full refund from Cathay Pacific. I had a completely separate flight on Delta Airlines from Orlando to JFK from March 3 - April 18 roundtrip. As soon as Cathay Pacific granted my full refund, I called Delta Airlines and explained my concern for going on my trip and they immediately turned my ticket into an ""e-credit"" that I need to redeem by Dec. 3, 2020 (anniversary of booking date). I'm sure you can at least get the e-credit at this point. That seems to be a small concern compared to the expense of the rest of the trip you had planned!"
"AnikaThe best suggestion I can give you right now is not to cancel yet. We are living on a day by day basis and May 8th is a long way to go. If you cancel today you'll lose your money but if you'll cancel May 7th you'll lose your money too. However if you wait until the last day things might be better for you, for us and for anyone else."

"#627 we were flying out 321 into bologna, then on to Bari/puglia. Bari/puglia canceled. US to Bologna is still not cancelled but we are allowed to change the dates. We decided we are going to do that."
Situation of the virus outbreak. The evolution of the epidemic in numbershttps://www.ansa.it/english/news/2020/03/09/…
BREAKING NEWS:Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has just announced an extension of the QUARANTINE to the ENTIRE COUNTRY.
"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has just announced an extension of the QUARANTINE to the ENTIRE COUNTRY.>>>GAC,Does this mean that no one enters and no one leaves the country?In other words, no travel to Italy is now official?"
Premier Conte spoke to Nation on TV right now.I watched him sayn all Italian Territory in under PROTECTED ZONE.More to come later
"Movements on all Italian Territory is permitted only for real matters like procurement of food, medicines or to work"
"Thank you, Raffaele. Was there any mention of an enddate of this Italy-wide decree?"
"To elaborate a bit #637's advice, people can move around only for documented reasons, i.e. to go to work, attend medical appointments, go grocery shopping.The strong recommendation to all citizens is 'stay home'.There is no end date for this, but presumably this is going to be in force at least until April 3."
good for Italy...glad they did not waste any more time..the jump in cases just since yesterday is crazy.
So sorry to hear this but it is probably the best move. Good luck to all those in Italy during this trying time.
"# 635I understand that foreign tourists will continue to be able to LEAVE Italy to return to their foreign residence or domicile.People will not be allowed ENTRY into Italy unless they have a documented, exigent business or personal reason, or if they are RETURNING to their residence or domicile in Italy.THIS MEANS NO NEW TOURIST ENTRIES FOR NOW.These restrictions should remain in place until at least April 3."
Premier Conte to the Nation. The following is the stream videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXHWtR7-KgQ
Wouldn't you know it?! I canceled our flights at around Noon Chicago time and this declaration came out 4 hours later...lol. I wonder if I can still get a refund.Thanks everyone for your links and information. My heart goes out to all who have been affected by this. :(
Hopefully things in Italy will be brought under control soon. Its a wonderful country with good people.
"We were scheduled to arrive in Italy on April 14th. If the country is still quarantined at that point in time is that something that could be covered by Travel Insurance through our Credit Card? (Chase Mastercard)I was on hold for a while so just thought maybe someone else has already gotten the answer!Edited: 6:37 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Kevin B, I feel your pain.We are booked to sail with ANEK from Bari to Greece on the 3rd April, I’m not looking forward to phoning my insurance company, holding on the line and all the palaver that goes with it."
"ITALIANS EMPTYING OUT SUPERMARKETS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, after Prime Minister's announcement:(watch the videos)https:/…NOTE: Food markets remain OPEN, and people are ALLOWED to leave their homes to purchase groceries!!!"
Chase has been telling their Visa customers that the travel insurance attached to their credit cards do not cover coronavirus-related cancellations. I doubt that their Mastercard products are different in that regard.In fact I'd be surprised if any credit card's travel insurance would pay under these circumstances.
"Thank you, GAC, my heart goes out to those in that video and throughout Italy.If your travel dates fall within the proclamation dates, why are you calling your credit card company? Our trip was for March 21-March 28 and so far, everyone I've emailed to request refunding of my prepayments has been forthcoming. They cannot provide the room, flight, tour, etc. to me, because I am not permitted to enter Italy, been straight-forward. Of course, if your travel dates are later (after April 3), you must patiently wait to see what transpires.Edited: 10:54 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"I'm waiting and, frankly, biting my nails to see what will transpire in the coming days. My college student son and I were planning a tour of Tuscany during his easter Holidays. Our arrival is scheduled for the 5th of April."
"My trip was scheduled for mid April into Bologna and end of May out of Malpensa. I pretty much knew a couple weeks ago that I would not go, but watched for developments.Visited doctor who recommended that I not go due to age group.and health history. Got letter for same. Called Delta and they were unrealistic and not helpful. When travel alert went to level 3 Delta said to apply for a refund and fax the doctors letter. I applied for a refund last week, but didnt have immediate access to.a fax so procrastinated....When I called today to see if I still needed to send the doctors letter, evidently Delta had must received news of the PMs new declaration of quarantine for the entire country. They gave me a full and immediate refund in less than a minute. Happy I will now be able to visit in the future, but my heart breaks for the Italian people. I hope it wont be as bad for the US, but best be prepared."
"@GAC While I enjoy/appreciate your posts, capitalisation means *shouting*. We can all read lower case and don't like to be shouted at."
About situation in ItalyAll the sky areas and resorts are closed. Here are the live images from Madonna di Campiglio (Dolomites)https://www.ski.it/it/webcam-and-livecam-ski…
"My trip to Rome + Northern Italy is scheduled for April 23-May 10. I have not called it off yet - my hotel reservations allow for a full refund if the cancellation occurs 48 hours before arrival. Not such luck with the plane tickets for which I would get an approx 60% refund. To make things worse, the current financial turmoil is resulting in a much more expensive euro for us in Mexico. We have chosen to wait and see how things evolve from here to Easter and will make a decision come April 13. We may need to change our itinerary and visit Southern Italy instead - which has not been hit as heavily as the North but things are changing on a daily basis."
"So, only a week ago, the quarantines and majority of infections were in the North and things we're overall, relatively still calm ... but in just 7 days, rates have exploded and the entire country is basically on lockdown. This is the trend and I think it'll continue escalate for about another 2 weeks in Itally/Europe, hit a peak and then begin to taper. By May, things should be back to ""normal."" The problem though, is the US is about 2 -3 weeks behind, so travel around and from the US may not be allowed, into May. Late May/June ... possibly as late as July ... is probably when the dust begins to settle globally on this. By then the outbreak will have run its bell curve like course, warmer weather kicks in, and the panic will subside as everyone gets more accustomed to this virus being around. Also, by then, there should be a clearer picture on who''s most adversely affected, which will reassure those less at risk to get out and about. The cruise industry is rightfully due for a shakeup/shakedown from all this. About 15% of their market is 70+ with another 20% in their 60s. When you mix that with being on a floating petri dish (Norovirus, Influenza, Norwalk, eColi ...) the outcome is not good.Edited: 9:25 am, March 10, 2020 "
On situation in Italy. Empty cities but alive.Here is an article describing today life in many of the Italians main citieshttps://www.ansa.it/canale_saluteebenessere/…
"adgib: Where are you getting information to state such a thing: ""This is the trend and I think it'll continue escalate for about another 2 weeks in Itally/Europe, hit a peak and then begin to taper. By May, things should be back to ""normal."" ""While that would be a positive way for things to progress, really, where on earth are you getting your confidence of such a trajectory occurring given how little is known about this virus and how few people, overall, have been tested?"
"Post 657 may be correct - the BBC just showed the PM saying that the peak is expected in the UK in two weeks. No one knows of course, but China has already peaked."
"I'm spending my afternoon sending e-mails and filling forms to try to recover some of my money,Ryanair, hotels, trenitalia, vatican, colosseum, Galleria dell'Academia. I don't know how it will turn out but I'll keep you informed.Someone told me a few minutes ago that Ryanair will do a full refund to passengers flying to Italy. I'll have to check this out."
@Paulo M Any updates on refunds would be helpful as I'm sure many are dealing with the same thing. Thanks!
"First people to face penal problems in violation of rules against virus outbreakhttps://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/coro…Google translatedA prostitute and one of her clients were reported in Busto Arsizio (Varese) for violating the provisions of the decree establishing the measures for the containment of the coronavirus. Both were resident in other municipalities in the province of Varese. For the two, since they moved in the reinforced containment area without justification, the complaint was made for non-compliance with the Authority's provisions (article 650 of the penal code).In Porto Empedocle (Agrigento) a funeral procession has been reported on foot along the streets of the town, in the direction of the cemetery. The carabinieri identified and reported 48 people for violation of the obligations imposed by the authority. Now I will open a criminal case against them at the Public Prosecutor's Office in Agrigento for an offense for which arrest of up to three months is expected.In the Cuneo area, a group of amateur cyclists was stopped during a training that was taking place on the roads of the province. In Rimini, a dozen tourists were stopped while attempting to board a flight to Tunisia, where they intended to spend a holiday, the same fate for two people in Parma bound for Madrid."

"@Mcat ... There is no certainty in my prognostication, as that would be foolish and no one is certain how this will play out ... BUT, most outbreaks follow a common trend. ""Farr's Law of Epidemics, first promulgated in 1840 and resurrected by Brownlee in the early 1900s, states that epidemics tend to rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a normal bell-shaped curve."" It's happening in China right now. ...and if you look at the current escalation in Europe, not just Italy, it's following a similar path. Only so many people are susceptible to a virus, and as long as this thing does not mutate too much, it will follow a well trodden course. Things are about to get dicey across the EU and the US will be close behind ... ""We are 10 days from the hospitals getting creamed,” Tom Bossert, who was Trump’s homeland security adviser until he was ousted in 2018. China was a bit aggressive in their containment measures, so their curve may be a bit accelerated, and by no means are they in the all clear, but they have seen a steady decline in new cases and are even shutting down coronavirus specific facilities and treatment centers. So that's the precedence. Be well and be safe in the coming weeks. Spend the extra time you'll have at home to watch for cheap airfares and discounted travel this summer. Should be able to snag some pretty good deals. We were supposed to visit Italy this week and next, but canceled, so we'll be looking for deals to recoup our trip. I don't really care about the airlines (they'll survive through government bailouts and corporate well-fare ... yes socialism is a live and kicking in the U.S., if you're a corporation) but I will want to travel to Italy to support the local people and economy."
"Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has announced on Italian national television today that doctors and equipment will be arriving from China to assist their Italian counterparts to fight the Coronavirus epidemic, bringing with them experience from Chinese hospitals."
"The Kevin B #646I contacted Expedia Sunday 730AM, got thru within 5 minutes and got full refund with Expedia carrier United for travelling between 4/20 to 5/6 NJ to Rome round trip.

"Of interest to train travellers: I have just received a refund from SNCF for my trip Geneva - Paris, part of my planned trip home from Italy mid April.

"I added this query in a separate thread but thought I would reach out here as well as it seems there are many following this thread who have lots of experience traveling in Italy:I am currently seeking a refund from trenitalia because of my necessary cancellation of travel plans due to the Covid-19 outbreak in italy. One refund, though not in-full, was fairly straightforward and instantaneous online. Another has been a bit problematic. It's a smaller, regional fare so I may just call it a wash and leave it without seeking a refund but I am confused by a message that I got on the trenitalia refund page. I put in all my information, typed a quick note stating my reason for seeking a refund and the message I receive from trenitalia is""The module has the following errors: Warning: this refund request must be presented at the ticket office."" Well, I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to get to the ticket given the fact that I am currently not able to enter the country. Any advice from experienced train travelers in Italy who can advise me on how/where to go to seek a refund for canceled travel?"

"Dennis. I am happy to know you are at home and fine.Thank you very much for your words. I must admit that TA has given me the opportutity to fullfill the empty days at home with no much to do, unless than look out of the windows and watch an empty street.Writing in here feels to me not being alone. As I am just retired I had a lot of plans to do, mostly travelling, wich I only can do virtually with Google Maps at moment.There are stil 23 days of lonelyness to go. Thankfully I am not alone at home but my thoughts go to people who are. My daughter and my son, 17 and 21, are facing a new situation. They are not used to be at home all day but they have a lot to do with school where lessons are held virtually. Plus, thanks to the Internet, they videochat each other with their friends and distances are shortened.I'll keep writing in here as there is not much else to do ;-)Wishes to all. If we will do what we have been asked to do, as a Nation, we will be out soon from this troubleLove to all"
"@#659 ""China has already peaked""First off I am not talking about Hubei which did not tail off quickly and extreme measures were employed.I am talking about cities like Shenzhen (about 16 million) and Shanghai (about 20 million). The cities were divided into zones and access to the zones was for residents only. All office buildings were closed. No restaurant was allowed to have dine-in customers, so take-away only. A tent village was set up outside our gates for deliveries. The customer picked up from there. China has very advanced online ordering and local delivery services.My temperature was checked many times a day - as I had been in Shenzhen more than 14 days my movements were not restricted in public areas, so I could visit the supermarkets which remained open. Pharmacies remained open too, but I couldn't go inside and just made any order at a table blocking the door.All residents of my area were part of an online group which passed information from the management. There was no need for any enforcement. People did it because they were convinced it was the right thing to do. ""Stay in bed for three weeks for China!""As a result Shenzhen has had two new cases in the last two weeks - one coming from the UK and one from Spain. From what I read of the Italian lockdown it seems a lot less organised."
"Thanks Raffaele.. Very valuable to hear about life at home. Can you say more from personal situation... shopping, food supplies, etc."
"@DennisI didn't go out yet. When I'll do I'll report.@MikeccI am afraid China and Italy have two different culture and two different administrative organizations.I am not saying one is better than the other but what could be done in China was impossible to do in Italy, at least at the time it has been done in China. Now it seems too late but ""stay in bed for three weeks for China"" has become “Io sto a casa” translated to “I stay at home”. Io sto a casa is a decree signed by government but also a concept sponsored by many people on social media that anybody wants to comply, imposed or not. There are penal consequences but the 99.9% of population complied understanding the higher value to loose something assumed for granted in the name of the collectivity health.On the collectivity values China and Italy are the same ;-)Next two weeks will be crucial for Italy. Let's hope for the best"
"My flight to Rome on March 25 was cancelled by Ryanair with full refund. That's good news. My returning flight, from Bolonha to Porto was not yet cancelled.I'm having a little trouble to understand Trenitalia policies regarding refunds. I have a trip from Roma Termini to Firenze S. M. Novella on March 29 and on Trenitalia site it says:Per i treni a media e lunga percorrenza, il rimborso integrale è in bonus utilizzabile entro un anno. La richiesta può essere effettuata, compilando l’apposito web form disponibile su trenitalia.com o presso qualsiasi biglietteria.Per i treni regionali, il rimborso integrale è in denaro. La richiesta può essere effettuata compilando l’apposito modulo on line o presso le biglietterie.Does this means that I can't have a full refund?

@PauloRoma to Firenze is a Regional train and I am afraid they stated that online they'll only issue a voucher to be used within next year. For a money refund it'll be cash issued directly at Biglietteria (Ticket Office)@DemiHaleThank you for your words. I'll do my best ;-)
"Thank you for your answer Raffaele.I truly can't understand their policy. How are we supposed to get to a biglietteria since we are not allowed to get in the country in the first place? I'm trying the chat online on the Trenitalia site but it's impossible to contact with them.I'm also trying to get a refund (total or partial) from the hotel I reserved in Rome but they are only available to postpone my dates. They have housekeepers to pay, so they say… This is going to be a battle…Keep safe everyone!"
"@PauloGiven it'll be your decision, may I suggest to eventually consider to postpone your trip?If you cannot get a refund it'll probably be the best option ;-)All this mess will be over one day, hopefullyGood luckRaf"
"We have lost the payment of trenitalia tickets in the past. It’s important to maintain perspective. Raffaele has pointed to community values in maintaining isolation to stop this disease. This ‘stop’ in Italy in hope it peters out and or hope of vaccine. This is an effort in Italy of importance to the whole globe, not just town A or country X. The thump to the Italian economy is enormous, the stress to Italian society is huge. We will probably see from this epidemic considerable changes in how the world works, what the world values. Much depends on what values we hug to."

"Raffaele this trip to Italy was almost like a dream come true. Be capable to have a few days of vacation all at once (me, my wife and my kids) is not always possible. But this year we did it and we were very excited to go to Rome and Florence. I'm quite sure that in the next 12 months we wont be able to go to Italy. Well, let's hope Trenitalia finds another way to compensate those in the same situation.On the other hand, the good news is that Booking just send me an e-mail telling me that my reservation for the hotel in Rome was canceled without any penalty despite the initial refusal of the hotel to ""negociate"" some kind of compensation. Here in Portugal a lot of schools, museums, theatres and music concerts are already shut down and the news are that many italian doctors are transmitting a lot of info to our hospitals to deal and understand better this virus.Portuguese and italian people are very similar. Very relaxed, love to drink wine, dance, speaking loud and enjoying good food and the sun. These extreme measures concerning the isolation of the virus tell us all that this is no joke. Italy is now our reference, unfortunately because of the brutal numbers of deceased and people in intensive care. We don't have an excuse now not to be aware, but here is just getting started so shopping malls continues full of people, everybody keeps kissing everybody despite all the warnings. Oh well..."
"Loving these ongoing discussions.I've been stubborn, holding my breath for the slight chance my April 15-May 8 trip can be saved, but every day, it's looking less and less likely.My hotel in Venice is refusing to refund me, as is one in Croatia, and like others, all my train booking will be ""fun"" to sort out. These are definitely crazy times, and I feel for the Italian community for what they are going through.Here in Canada, and more specifically, my province, our numbers have just doubled over night, so looks like we will be hitting reality here very soon."
"From tomorrow, Hungary will refuse entry to anyone coming from Italy (apart from Hungarian citizens who will be subjected to compulsory quarantine). I think there is also a similar ban in place in AustriaI am no expert, but maybe it is just a matter of time that Croatia or Slovenia also introduces this measure."

Nobody close to each other.Very few cars around and public transport is working. I have seen only two people on the bus, both wearing masks like the driver himself. All activities are closed except pharmacies and food stores like groceries, butchers and others. Nobody queuing outside but I could see a sign stating that entrance was allowed only to one person at a time.I was following another car that had been halted by Police. I am not sure but the Officers are controlling where and why you are moving around by car. You need a good reason to move and going to see a doctor is one of them. I meet 3 Police cars in 20 minutes run. Never saw so many.I am back home now and believe me the next time I'll go out will be for a good reason (food, medicines or for a short and lone walk around home).Edited: 12:13 pm, March 11, 2020 "

"12,462 cases (total active and closed) reported today (Mar 11) represent a one day increase of 2,313 (12,462 - 10,149). Unfortunately, this is the largest 1 day increase reported since I've began tracking these numbers on March 2.Yesterday (Monday) in another TripAdvisor Italy Covid-19 thread I reported that there was *only* an increase of 11% (total active and closed) as compared to the day prior (Sunday). This was significant because the % increase each day, looking back to March 2, had been fairly constant, averaging about 24% more cases than the day prior. My hope yesterday was to see the day to day percentage of cases (active and closed) continue to trend downward. Unfortunately today's numbers reflect a one-day percentage increase of 22.8%.From March 2 to March 11, total cases (active and closed cases) have increased by an average of 22.4% from the day prior (consistent with the 22.8% one day increase reported earlier today).Please advise if I have erred in my calculations."

"Good evening my friends and thank you for your beautiful wordsI went out today, in Chieti, Abruzzo, where I live to buy some medicines. Yesterday I went out by car as reported on post #702 but today I went out walking. I had to go to the pharmacy, one of the good reasons to go out without facing penal problems.The pharmacy is not far. I live close to the centre, about 10 minutes walking. Chieti is not a bit town. I took the longest path. I needed to walk and I did. Nobody or only a few people around, walking quickly mostly wearing masks. I saw some people wearing a mask even alone driving the car. I believe it is useless in this case. Anyway all of the food shops where open like the greengrocer, the butcher, the Alimentari, which is a sort of very small market to buy anything from cheese, ham, salami, bread, milk and more. Even the fishmonger was open. All of them were empty. Nobody queueing outside and nobody inside. No, I am sorry, I saw a lady buying some fruit at the greengrocer. Obviously, all the people who needed to buy food already did and the shelves were still plenty.The big guys of the big distribution food chains are out of town. I didn't go. I cannot report directly but a friend of mine went there and he reported them open. Shelves full and very few people around. No panic and no hysteria anywhere. Only loneliness. The atmosphere was unreal, unimaginable.I went trough the pharmacy door where I was the only costumer. They gave me what I needed and I went out. I know the guy behind the desk. We was desolately looking at each other, both wearing a mask. I took a couple of pictures on the street I shared on my profile here:https:/…4477544 It was 7 pm and normally there was going to be quite a lot of people due the short walk they take when the work has finished and before to go home. As I said Chieti is a little town and life is not in a rush like in the big towns.When I went home I begun thinking on our situation as a people, as a Nation. If we are doing what we are doing is to save lives. My be not ours but the life of someone next to us, at one meter of distance.Now, the numbers are high. At this point it's meaningless to report the exact number of death or the exact number or new positives. We both know them to be high, too high and there is no difference in 10K or 20K. They are both too high.For the above mentioned reason I'll stop reporting numbers and I'll eventually focus on percentages. On the meaning of the numbers and how they should be interpreted I found a today article I would like to share.In the article the numbers are reported but also how they should be read:https:/… Google translatedBy now, in the late afternoon of each day, we are used to seeing the head of the Civil Protection, and extraordinary commissioner for the Covid-19 emergency, Angelo Borrelli, releasing a series of numbers relating to the spread of the new coronavirus (Sars- CoV-2) in our country.Data on positive, healed and deceased cases can be consulted online in an interactive Civil Protection map, which also provides regional statistics on the number of tests carried out and the number of patients hospitalized with symptoms, of those in intensive care or in home isolation.But how should these numbers be read? Let's try to clarify, with a short reading guide to the main items of the Civil Protection bulletins.----Article is too long to be completely translated"
"Thanks Raffaele. It is good that food supplies are there but many will not have money. I understand the government has set up some financial safety nets for both business and individuals.The biggest problem with the statistics, my view, is that where governments are vigilant and there are many tests, there are higher statistics. So I'm wary of other places where tests are few.===When I was first in Rome, after a week of language training I had to dive into seven newspapers a day and began speaking a very weird kind of political journalist language.

This is the official prediction on the spread of the virus made by the Government which can be read in the technical report of the third emergency decree expected in the Council of Ministers. A forecast that takes into account the latest most stringent measures adopted in recent days by the government that have transformed Italy into a red zone and which will produce their effects - as all epidemiologists say - after about 7-10 days. Hence the forecast of the peak on March 18."

I hope that foreign embassies in Italy are reporting the details of Italian social, economic initiatives to deal with the impossible situation. To be examples elsewhere. Looked at from far away I am conscious of the success and stability, the absence of fierce partisan politics so far, the community acceptance of the situation and the importance of order.

When people post asking what Tuscany is like in winter, I always point out it’s deadly quiet, that I am often the only person on the street and that the majority of shops besides food stores are closed.

It was all done by social pressure and people behaving sensibly. I was very rarely within 2 metres of anyone else except when paying at the supermarkets or when getting my temperature checked entering the area I live in. Everyone out wore masks, not that they do much good, but more as a sign that ""I'm doing all I can"". We had a WeChat group in our building and information was passed along by the management, so all knew what was happening.

"MuscoviteThank you for your support. What you are doing sharing Opera videos is impressive.Anyway, I am afraid numbers are not stable. They are probably on the way to become stable, but aren't yet.I believe they are still growing sequentially. Luckly not exponentially. That would be worseGACIMHO I believe you are doing a good job reporting numbers like you are doing.Being anybody not subjected to any restriction other than being on topic or requested by TA Staff, please continue"
"These are the Italy forums, and Spain is discussed on the Spain forums.As Raffaele indicated, numbers are not stable in Italy.The links are provided for anyone interested in cfurther information.GAC is always factual and informative, respectful, within guidelines, and he cares.It's just that the numbers are too painful to bear.Vagabonda"
I removed my post #930 and apologise to GAC and anyone finding the stats useful..My emotions got the better of me yesterday.Stay safe everyone.
"Emotions are getting the better of us all maudsters.Everyone has different needs and different ways of handling a situation, and we just need to do whatever it takes for us to get through this.Stay well!Vagabonda"
GAC is a name that I trust as posting facts (as best they are known at the time) and I have followed his posts since way back when this first hit China. At that time people did not get the seriousness of this at all and were planning vacations to China...GAC's advice has always been realistic. Yes he reports numbers that are depressing but they are what they are and hopefully soon he can report that they are going down. I hope he continues to contribute.

"I'm seeing that the tone on the forums is changing, as it mirrors our lives. From singing to silence, from hope to despair, from patience to impatience, from normalcy to exhaustion....still we march on and provide each other with much needed love, support, facts and figures. We all write differently and especially during times of stress. Let us not ""shoot the messenger"" but instead choose who we wish to read (or not). I know my problem is spending an inordinate amount of time reading about what is going on (papers, forums, online) ...and t.h.a.t. is not the best for my spirit.The first three threads on the Italy Forum are for ""official coronavirus information"" or similar. I am grateful for those who spend the time and effort to keep us informed.There has been another thread started, The Layover Lounge. According to TA, ""the Layover Lounge is a place where we can connect socially, discuss trips we hope to take after the outbreak is contained, share travel stories, and exchange tips on staying connected to the destinations we love (or hope to visit) while stuck at home."" I cannot begin to express my sorrow, fear, pain and sadness to Italy. I do not have enough words to fully comprehend the magnitude of this global pandemic nor do I have the words to express my depth of worry about where I live and what may happen to me, my family, friends and community. I worry about TA forum colleagues and their suffering wherever they live....it can be overwhelming so we need to take breaks and be kind to each other.

"@Sabrina. I thought that too. As the disease can be transferred through droplets, perhaps that means flying perspiration"
"It clings to your breath aerosol possibly.Apparently it survives 3 hours in the air, as aerosol.So you could be conceivably walking behind somebody and breathe in the virus suspended in the air.

"All indications are that the US is about 2-3 weeks behind Italy and while our average is lower than Italy we might expect the death rate to increase from the current 2.18% to Italy's 11.9%.We are just starting to get enough tests, testing locations and labs to test more people. Until then many people who have the virus don't know and unintentionally spread it. Additionally distancing and stay at home orders in the US are being enacted on a state by state basis.

"Sabrina, think of “aerosol” as being like a vapor trail. Or like a smoker exhaling a puff of smoke. An infected person could exhale with “droplets” hanging in the air before falling to the ground or being blown in the breeze. The vapor trail at rest is barely there but with exertion it could be a larger puff of air. That’s why there is a ban against jogging. A jogger passed me on my walk this morning. She was at full tilt and breathing heavily. She passed me appx three feet away. I ducked and got as far out of the way of her vapor trail as possible. I live in a small community featuring two 18-hole golf courses and tennis courts. Folks are upset about not being allowed to play golf or tennis. Golf, I can see maybe, but not tennis. Too much hot air being exhaled that could contain virus particles."

"My dad, who is a one year recovered Stem Cell transplant for Leukemia, has a small business of buying and selling golf clubs online. He is complaining about not being able to go on the golf course. I get stopping other sports, where close contact is a must, but closing a golf course (assuming they limited visitors and had the sanitation protocol strictly enforced) just doesn't make a ton of sense. When we would play, we wouldn't be anywhere near anyone else the whole game. But as someone mentioned before a blanketed decision with out exceptions is easier to enforce. My thoughts were a form of exercise that keeps the cardio going and the lungs ""stretched"" is a healthy/safer option. Not to mention the mental health of the population is better when they are safely away from others enjoying the outdoors.The older generation dies much faster when they are not active."
"978.-The numbers are growing so quickly in the USA now because we finally are getting tests. However the restrictions on getting a test (even though it was said anyone that wanted to test would be given one) are still in place. In Mobile, Alabama, we have fought to get test and even sought out other agencies to purchase them, but they are still limited to ""answering all"" of the questions correctly. We are still not on complete lock down but I presume we will be shortly. Thats the biggest problem we face. Until mandated and forced to stay home-a ton of the population run about like they are invincible. We are at over 215,000 this morning at the rate we are going we will be at 500,000 before this weekend. Part of me wishes the president would lock us down, because if this virus isn't for lack of better words-suffocated out. We might very well be stuck in this same crisis in August."

"A category over the others is paying the highest tribute. Number of doctors who lost their life to save ours is up to 100 and growing.https://www.ansa.it/canale_saluteebenessere/…Google TranslatedCoronavirus, white coat sacrifice, 100 deceased doctorsAnelli, some of the retirees had been called back into businessDoctors who have died from the Covid-19 epidemic reach 100.Another 4 white coats, according to the National Federation of Medical Orders (Fnomceo), have in fact lost their lives. They are the family doctors Marzio Zennaro, Tahsin Khrisat, Mario Rossi and Samar Sinjab. The total includes active doctors, retirees, retired people who have been called to work or who have been assisting.The number of frontline healthcare workers who died or became infected with Coronavirus rises every day. Unions and orders have been clamoring for weeks that those who work in contact with Covid-19 patients should be able to do it safely with adequate personal protective equipment. Meanwhile, the list of health workers who did not manage to win the battle against the virus is growing. 26 nurses died and 6,549 positives. A total of 12,681 health workers are infected, including doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, ambulance drivers, auxiliaries. The National Federation of Nursing Professions Orders (Fnopi)) underlined that within 48 hours the number of positive among nurses is equal to a third of the total infected in the same period of time, also indicating that it is the health category that counts the highest number of positives: 52% of all operators. Tonino Aceti, Fnopi's spokesman, asked once again for swabs and individual protective devices to be guaranteed: ""The nurses stay longer alongside the patient, and take shifts of up to 12 hours each, which make the chances of contagion. They are paying a very high price. "" The president of Fnopi Barbara Mangiacavalli explained: ""Our goal is to assist patients, identify their needs and be close to them, affect the organizational and decision-making process of the system and give targeted responses to the economic contingencies and needs that emerge from the current demographic scenario and epidemiological "". For his part, the president of Fnomceo Filippo Anelli expressed his appreciation for the words of the President of the Republic asking that ""doctors, nurses, operators must no longer be left alone to fight against the virus. They must never be left again to address the problems and gaps in our National Health Service "". Anelli added: ""We count on you, President, on the Minister of Health Roberto Speranza, on the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, so that the sacrifices and the work of the professionals are answered with the right respect and recognition""."
"So glad to see things seem to be improving in Italy as far as new cases and deaths - though still far from great. I know we still have a long road ahead all over the globe, but I feel hopeful that our social distancing measures are making a difference and it's good to see some countries seeming to be over the peak. Or at least the first peak...I'm still nervous about future peaks. But maybe we've all learned better how to distance ourselves and protect ourselves and can come out far better than the initial grim predictions. I wish you all the best and I hope to see Italy in the not too distant future :-)"

Very encouraging news to see a decrease! Happy Easter
"Easter in Hospital.A grandfather to his nephews in video call: I am an astronauthttps://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/speciali/20…Google translated""It's a surprise, right now it's like we're there."" The psychologist of the intensive care unit smiles behind the mask, while the video of Elisabetta's family scrolls from her cell phone, talking directly to mother Annamaria. She moves her eyes behind the respirator: for the first time in three weeks she sees a face uncovered, but through the screen of a mobile phone. These are Easter greetings in absentia in the Covid departments. For days at the Policlicnico of Tor Vergata in Rome they have been equipped to communicate with family members and challenge the oxymoron of a drama party. ""I have a list of all the relatives of the sick with their numbers, there are dozens. I call them every day. Tablet and mobile phone for them are like a window on this department, we often manage to get them talking and that's what we want to do for everyone, where possible, even on Easter day "", explains Francesca Alfonsi, psychologist at the intensive care unit of the Polyclinic.But sometimes it is also patients who give strength to those who wait at home on the other side. Daniele, 56, an employee of Zagarolo, is being treated in the pulmonology department and has lived for days with a helmet that helped him breathe. To his grandchildren, amidst rapid flows of oxygen and a continuous noise, he now tells of having become an astronaut. He reassures them by saying that he will return from the hyperspace journey and in the meantime at Easter he says goodbye to the planet coronavirus. ""This helmet has become my friend, for me it was a virtual experience, which is about to end"", explains Daniele, who has become an unusual explorer of the cosmos, just to see the grandsons' smile.""We communicate with our patients every day, we try to pamper them. It will be like this even at Easter. Someone who is better has even asked for wine, but I don't think that's really possible"", jokes professor Paola Rogliani, director of the respiratory diseases department. The company is especially valuable for those who, at almost a century of age, do not even have a cell phone. For Mario and Florinda, 99 years old he and 95 she, the doctors made an exception to the rule: the elderly Roman couple, both positive, is hospitalized in the same room in the infectious diseases department.    For Antonella Ferracci, nursing coordinator of the ward, it would not have been possible to do otherwise: ""It is a provision that we have given for a few days. Now they can also spend Easter Sunday together - he says - They do not have a mobile phone and it is difficult who can see someone. "" Taking care of Mario, at the side of his bed, is also his wife Florinda, who spurs him on: ""I have always given him something to eat and I will do it now too. We want to go back to our home garden soon"". For the two positive centenarians, who have almost defeated Covid, love is part of the healing therapy. And already we look to the future: ""The buckwheat tart? We will prepare it next year"""

"@ArubaIt's simple: the number of infected people is way higher than the number of tested people, so as days go by more tests are performed and more infected people are reported in the official stats.As to why the number of infected people is so high, Lombardy is extremely densely populated so it is only natural that it is the epicentre of the outbreak, just like London in the UK or NYC in the US.And the lockdown is not complete, as people are still allowed to shop for grocery and medicines, and many of them are still allowed to work.Edited: 6:18 am, April 14, 2020 "

"We were scheduled to travel to Italy in May, which we have sadly cancelled due to COVID-19. What are the thoughts on when to reschedule our vacation? Is it even viable this summer or fall? Or will it be waiting until next year? So sad, I love this country and so looked forward to seeing it again. Rome/Florence and Cinque Terre areas. Vicki"
"I am sorry Vicki. Nobody can tell. I can only suggest to stay tuned. Maybe late summer, maybe winter or maybe next year.When it'll happen someone will tell here"
"Same with me, Vicky, just cancelled my May flights.I have serious doubts about going to the sea in general now. No idea if the salty water kills the virus, or vise versa, spreads it around.And there is an opinion that this virus will be sort of a seasonal flue. Quite unnerving..."
"So Maybe in May we will see an end to quarantine!?! I wonder though how long after the quarantine is lifted before we can travel from one country to another (Specifically USA to Italy and back) without restrictions. I so desperately want to visit Italy this summer. However, I doubt that is possible now and the idea of waiting another year for the next possible trip is depressing.

"Just sharing this FYI. We are booked to fly Mtl-Rome on Air Canada June 22nd. The flight is still scheduled. If I cancel, AC offers a voucher good until April 30, 2021. For the record, we will not be travelling. I just spoke to my credit card (Infinite First class travel VISA) travel insurance to ask if I cancel will my insurance trip cancellation refund the cost of the tickets. The answer is no, based on the latest guidelines provided by the card issuer bank.So I am waiting in hopes that AC cancels the flight, in which case the voucher is valid for 24 months. I believe from date of cancellation, not of travel."
My flights from Melbourne to Rome for 20 May have been cancelled by Qantas. I have cancelled my hotels in Sicily and Malta. Still waiting to hear how I stand with my 2-week apartment in Naples - large deposit paid. I will not be going anywhere this year. (My tour to Japan in Sept was cancelled so this pandemic is not going to go away any time soon.) I think we have to be sensible and think about next year.

Maybe the wording of New cases got lost in translation somewhere. I had previously posted a question about the survival rate of those on ventilators, which I read was only 20% worldwide.

"Hypothesis about phase 2 are getting sharperhttps://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/20…Google translatedCoronavirus: jogging, bars and transportation. The restart is being preparedIn the subway the fever will be measured; outgoings by age groupOut and about with masks, measuring the fever on the subway, playing sports alone and outdoors and going out by age group. These are the hypotheses that are being defined in view of May 4, when the government will have to decide how and how much to ease the ""lockdown"". Surely the discos will remain closed, which will be the last to reopen, and at the bottom of the list there are also cinemas and theaters, while measures for museums are being studied. The school should not reopen before September but hypotheses of summer school camps are being studied, to help families.FASHION AND FURNITURE - While already some large companies, with union agreements, reopen their doors, the government could give the go-ahead, following the INAIL guidelines on less risky jobs, to the reopening of other production activities already the last week of April. These would be: automotive, furniture factories, textiles and leather goods, mineral extraction. There is discussion on the reopening of construction sites, because it is more difficult to ensure the distance.BARS, RESTAURANTS, STORES - If and when to reopen bars and restaurants, as well as the shops closed today, it is a hotly debated topic in the government and among experts. There are those who invite to consider the possibility of reopening with strict rules of distancing and limited entries from May 4th. But those who brake now prevail: more likely openings from mid or late May. Strict rules are also studied for hairdressers and beauticians.SCHOOLS AND COURTS - Institutions should not reopen their doors before September. Courts will start on 11 May.TRANSPORTATION - The Ministry of Transport is working with experts to study how to minimize travel risks for those who have to go to work. One-way routes, reduced on-board seats and temperature control for underground access are envisaged. Signage on the ground in railway stations and at bus stops to create neat rows with safety spacing. Mechanisms - through personnel on board or digital instruments - to count the people who get on each bus and, also in this case, seats to be occupied marked one by one. Quoted seats and crowding stops also on trains. There is the hypothesis of plexiglass bulkheads for taxis.SPORTS AND PARKS - Gyms still closed for a long time but outdoor sports, provided alone, and jogging could be allowed from 4 May even away from home. It is considered whether to introduce time slots for runners. For athletes, there may be a return to individual training, provided that they are safe. As for parks, reopening should also come for children's games, but with some rules.GARDENS AND BATHING FACILITIES - With two FAQs (answers to frequently asked questions) the government already gives the green light to the care of gardens and to maintenance in the bathing establishments. It is also possible to move from one municipality to another to take care of your vegetable garden or land, declaring that it is grown for self-production: the ban remains for gardens in second homes. The beaches remain closed to the public but staff can access the plants for surveillance or maintenance. Meanwhile, the measures for the summer are being studied: among the hypotheses there is also that of quota entrances to the beaches."

"One day there will be zero infections. We heard this phrase so many time but today we can finally calculate a date.https://www.ansa.it/canale_saluteebenessere/…Google translatedCoronavirus: Lombardy and Marche last for zero cases at the end of JuneRegional estimate on zero infection, in Lazio after 12 MayFirst Basilicata and Umbria in late April, last Lombardy and Marche in late June. In Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna not before the end of May. In the other Regions, the elimination of the infections could already occur between the third week of April and the first week of May. In Lazio after 12 May. These are the dates by which it will be possible to expect zero new infections from coronavirus, according to the map provided by the National Health Observatory in the Italian regions, coordinated by Walter Ricciardi.The last would be the Regions of the Center-North in which the infection started earlier: in Lombardy, where the first infection occurred, the resetting of new cases cannot be expected before June 28, in the Marche not before of June 27, since for both Regions the downward trend is particularly slow. The Autonomous Province of Bolzano should approach the elimination of the contagions starting from May 28, despite the fact that the number of contagions observed is low in absolute value, in fact, it sees a trend of new cases going down with particular slowness. In the Lazio Region we should wait at least May 12; in Veneto and Piedmont on 21 May.In the regions of Southern Italy the elimination of new infections should begin between the end of April and the beginning of May: for example Sardinia and Sicily respectively 29 and 30 April; Calabria May 1st; Puglia and Abruzzo on May 7; Campania on 9 May.The statistical models approximate the trend of the new cases observed over time and take into account the lockdown measures introduced by the DPCM. Therefore, the authors warn, ""any easing measures would make the projections unlikely"". The projections, the experts conclude, ""show that the epidemic is reducing very slowly, therefore these data suggest that the transition to Phase 2 should take place gradually and at different times from Region to Region"". An excessive anticipation of the end of the lockdown, in all probability, could ""bring the pandemic hands back and frustrate the efforts and sacrifices made so far""."

Hi AgfPM Conte is speaking to the Nation on TV.We will know something soon. I'll share as soon as I know
"Here are first news on the Web. PM Conte is still on TV answering question timeWe will know more details laterFor what I understood, lockdown will be eased but we will still have to certify ours movementschietitoday.it/attualita/fase-2-conte-decret…Google translatedItaly is preparing to exit the lockdown: Conte presents the new decreeFuneral ceremonies, sports activities and visits to relatives are allowed, however avoiding gatherings. The new measures will start on May 4, when we enter the so-called ""Phase 2"". In the sign of cautionRestart in complete safety: the national plan with which the Conte government is aiming for a recovery in the sign of caution is ready, starting from 4 May. During a press conference on the web and on TV, the prime minister illustrated the new dpcm tonight.“Now phase 2 begins, the phase of coexistence with the virus - the Prime Minister began - and we must be aware that the contagion curve can go up again. Social distancing of at least 1 meter will be even more important. This is fundamental, even in family relationships "".A ""very hard"" test awaits us also in the coming months, to quote the words of the premier. “In the coming weeks we must rebuild the country's bases. The government, I assure you, will do its part. It must be an opportunity to change all those things that have not gone for a long time ""added Conte confirming the commitment to keep the prices of the masked and the reduction of VAT on the Dpi.These are the salient points contained in the decree, in force from 4 to 18 May: the self-certification to move from one's own home within the region remains confirmed while the ban on moving from region to region will remain, except for proven work needs, absolute urgency or health reasons. The new decree of the Prime Minister provides for the possibility of visiting relatives but prohibits family reunions ""in respect of distances, with the adoption of masks and with a ban on gathering"", explains Conte. Prohibition of gathering in public and private places, therefore,Access to public parks and gardens is allowed, but mayors will be able to arrange for closure where safety measures cannot be ensured.Ok also for individual physical activity outdoors, even when moving away from home respecting the distance of one meter, as well as the training sessions of the athletes behind closed doors; for athletes who practice collective disciplinesRestrictions, however, will remain for the celebrations of the masses even after May 4, but there will be an exemption for funerals to which up to a maximum of 15 people will be admitted. As for restaurants and bars, the government confirms the possibility of being able to take away dishes, entering one at a time and consuming food away from the refreshment point.On production activities, Conte reported that from May 4 all manufacturing, the construction sector and wholesale functional to construction will reopen in compliance with the safety protocols at work signed last April 24.

"Thanks Raffaele for the update. I was holding out hope for my large family of 9 to see Italy-traveling to Tuscany, Rome and Sicily June 18 -July 4 but it doesn't look like it's going to happen. I need to cancel a lot of reservations and I wanted to wait as long as possible. I guess I should get started. I don't mean to diminish the tragedy of deaths in Italy or damage to Italy and the world's economy (900,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. We've been in lockdown for 6 weeks now. All businesses are closed except grocery.) I hope to be able to visit next year!Annette"
Thank you AnnetteI cannot believe the situation in U.S. is even worse than in Italy. Congratulations for your family. I love large families but we are a family of only four. Italy and Italians will be here for long wishing to welcome you and your lovely family after this tragedy will be over.Take care in U.S.Raffaele

"It's great to see all the sacrifices have had an impact. However I would caution people, whether in Italy or here in the US to get overly excited about the decreasing numbers. They are decreasing but the number of new cases today are just about the same as March 11. From March 11 to the peak March 21 was ten days. From March 21 to April 27 it's 37 days.We need to continue to be vigilant."
"Hi rjbeachThank you for your words. People here are taking the measures adopted very seriously. It's a general concern that at the beginning of phase 2 there won't be any more outbreaks. Hopefully not, but if anything will get wrong I know Protezione Civile is going to quarantine whole areas if necessary like it was for Codogno at the end of February.Anyway, let me say that numbers in U.S. are numbing. I would never have thought that situation in U.S. could get worse than in Italy.Please, stay strong"

"A newly published study reveals that a total reopening of business activities in Italy (including schools, and without any work-from-home) would result in over 150,000 people needing intensive care hospitalization by the end of the year, and over 400,000 hospitalizations:https:/…The 22-page report also notes that a reopening of schools could, of itself, result in a number of intensive care hospitalizations greater than what Italy can handle. Italy has a total of 9000 intensive care beds. The report goes on to analyze the consequences to public health of the reopening of the various segments of the Italian economy.This report prompted the Italian Prime Minister to stagger the reopening of economic activities to a greater extent than would otherwise have been the case."
"GAC, I totally agree.It's like looking at the storm clouds we can see at the horizon. PM must keep a cool head to avoid the storms. Reopening on May 4th is a modest attempt to get back to normality when we know it's impossible.Phase 2 has not begun yet, but we already know it will have to be stopped as soon as problems might arise.We will only succeed if we will find the right balance between activities reopening and social distancing.

"Hi, we are to travel from the US to Italy for our 50th birthday in September and I am just trying to figure out if we need to cancel. I've started with this thread and read your post. I'm risking asking the dumbest question but would you say, in your opinion, that our Italy trip needs to be a 2021 trip? Rome --> Tuscany ---> Amalfi --->Rome.Thank you in advance."
"Hi OxfordmsI saw you posted the same question in the following thread thus I will answer only in herehttps:/…106491898Italian Government has just released new directives to Italians valid from May 4th until May 18th. If you ask two Ministers what the Italian situation will be after May 18th you'll get two different answers. Probably similar but still different. Point is that any prediction anyone might tell is submitted on too many unknown factors to force it unpredictable.If this is true for the situation after May 18th would you imagine a prediction for September, not to say for the end of the 2020? Anyone is telling you to cancel or to stay with your scheduled trip is not really knowing what to do, me included.Now, my personal opinion on what I would if I were you.I would carefully read contractual options on canceling or staying. Mostly will also depend on how much money you are going to lose if you cancel because you asked to. If it's their fault you might get a better deal. Then, with a clear view of the contractual clauses I will decide if it's better to wait until the last possible day before to make any decision. To be their fault you need to wait until the situation will be predictable for September, so they will know if they will honor the contract you signed or not.Until then if you resign requesting to cancel earlier is up to you ""why"" and yours are the problems.May I suggest a third option other than to stay or to cancel that is to postpone. Given you don't know what the situation will be in Tennessee either, nobody cal tell if airlines will connect Italy to U.S. for touristic traffic in September. But pandemic will be over by 2021. If not we will have to face worse problems than decide if cancel or not a scheduled trip ;-)"
"Excellent, very reasoned and measured response. You confirmed there's really no good answer right now and to wait but it would be a suprize if September is a real option for us. Be safe and thank you for the response."
"Yes! You are right Hope you'll go on your trip in September but I am afraid is going to be very difficult....Anyway, let's seeTake care in U.S. and be safe"

Please also think about a family for each person with each number.Many of you globally fully live this and understand.I have now lost a third family member to this virus.And I can tell you about other family members and friends, and about the families and friends of friends, and everything from deaths to hospital stays, recoveries and improvements, rehabilitation centres, doing well, and even a miscarriage related to this virus.It's heartbreaking.Count your blessings if your only impact is a lockdown.And then our family members and friends who are on the front-line risking their own lives and so courageously taking care of us all as we fight this pandemic.Please let's have some heart here. You may not have it bad where you live. Lucky you!You might be thinking stats only, and when will travel restrictions end. Lucky you!I hope you appreciate your position.There are many who have lost loved ones. 265.043 globally.And also those infected and sick.A staggering 3.821.691 globally.That number equates to a lot of pain.After awhile those numbers become so surreal that it's easy to lose focus that it's real, and that it's not just a number, but a person; a wife or husband, son or daughter, mother or father, grandparent or cousin, or cherished childhood friend.....;there's a person with each number.Vagabonda"

It's our lives, and the lives of our family members and friends at risk.There are those who scoff at Italy/Sicily's medical care. I challenge you!!It's a pity that countries didn't learn from Italy's early experiences.We had a lot to learn quickly. Other countries had the opportunity and advantage to benefit from time to prepare, and our experiences, and some did not. Their shoddy and patchy responses to this virus still continue in either inadequacy, or sheer stupidity.And that seems even after illnesses, lost loved ones, loss of jobs and income, lockdown, distance learning, lost travels, and extreme daily hardships.This virus is what it is. You can't wish it away. You can't lie it away. You can't manipulate it for political benefit. You just suffer it, and feel losses from it.This virus is cruel. This virus robs us of saying goodbye. Our loved ones die alone. Our loved ones are alone in hospital except for the heroic hospital staff who very often connect patients with families via their own mobiles. And we are even robbed of a service where family and friends might assemble to honour and pay respects, and feel comfort, warmth and support. I had a family member fearful of controls to attend her mother's funeral. Only one family member was permitted. Some have no family members in attendance.And hopefully some countries will learn lessons. Test, and test, and contact trace, develop a (shared) vaccination and treatment.And only cautiously reopen whilst still collecting information about contagion spread, and then deal with the facts and reality. We all want the normalcy that we had. Wouldn't that be lovely to be so simple again? But that's just not reality. This pandemic is an historical and life-changing event, a major milestone of dramatic historical proportions.We will have to deal with disappointments, losses, and the new normal. If anyone is so challenged by this reality, and it is truly challenging, then please seek the love and support of families or friends, or services and assistance for support needed to get you through these extremely challenging times.And yes, hugs are missed!We need to be kind to ourselves, and each other.A virtual hug to you all, and my sincerest thanks for the support I have felt from you.Vagabonda"

""The policemen - writes Daniele Q. with a hint of sarcasm - are making fines to honest entrepreneurs who demonstrate peacefully respecting the safety distance ..."".""When there is to thank the Milanese for their virtuous behavior I am always the first to do it and I also like it. But there are times when there is pissed off and this is one of those: yesterday's long images the Navigli are shameful "". So the mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, commented in the video that every day posted on his social pages, too many people who yesterday poured onto the Navigli at aperitif time. ""I am not a politician from metaphors, I am a politician from acts. Either things change today, not tomorrow, it is an ultimatum, or I will be here as usual in Palazzo Marino tomorrow and I will take measures, I close the Navigli and I close the takeaway ""of bars and restaurants. It is the ultimatum launched to citizens by the mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, who thus spoke of what happened last night at the aperitif time on the Navigli, with too many people on the street.""If we behave carefully and in accordance with the prescriptions that we now know, we will be able to conquer another area of ​​freedom and thus favor a full restart, especially in view of the stage on May 18th"". So the president of the Lombardy Region, Attilio Fontana, addresses citizens on the eve of the first post lockdown weekend. ""This is a very delicate moment - warns Fontana in a video message - the citizens, who have understood that they have to respect the rules of the lockdown, I hope they also respect those necessary in Phase 2.""The Higher Institute of Health (ISS) also calls for compliance with the rules. ""The images of crowds in Milan cause concern: economy and health are not at odds. Health checks must be increased precisely to encourage reopening. I absolutely urge you to respect the rules of social distancing and the use of masks,"" said the epidemiologist Gianni Rezza at the weekly press conference organized by the Superior Health Institute."

"Today tribute to Italy is given by The Blues Brothers Band singing the most traditional song of Milano: ""O mia bela Madunina""Just incrediblehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aps6X-KtyacGoogle translated""O mia bela Madunina"", the symbolic song of Milan, remotely reinterpreted in the days of the coronavirus. Once again, music acts as a social bond by uniting Ossola musicians and American colleagues from the Original Blues Brothers Band. After a few concerts, a holiday in Puglia and a disc recorded together, the Americans contacted Italian friends in Ossola to find out if the families were doing well. The Americans, struck by a version of ""O mia bela Madunina"" performed by a trumpeter at the Milan window and by the archbishop's prayer to Madunina on the roof of the Duomo, thought of another nice way to bring together faith and music. The arrangement is by Lou Marini with the Original Blues Brothers Band. ""It is fantastic the enthusiasm with which these professionals sent us audio and video contributions to compose the clip which, despite the secular nature of the song, wants to join all the prayers that are being done in this difficult period"" say the members of the Italian Blues for people, a band which includes the Ossolans Alessio Papalardo, Walter Lagger, Nicola Riva and Andrea, Matteo and Pietro Prina."

"Ciao Raffaele,You know as I do that these past months have not been easy. We all wish for our normal lives. But what occurred in Milano just can't happen again. Responsibility was completely lacking as well as respect for everyone's safety. And in Lombardia of all places for this to have happened!!We can't stay in lockdown forever, but we still have a lot of new cases, and a lot of new deaths.Even if I am cautiously optimistic, the numbers are too high. I continue to hope, but I am not encouraged when I see what occurred in Milano, and the complete lack of responsibility, and I worry about the travel south from Milano this week.I hope I am wrong.Vagabonda"
"Really there was poor leadership not to know the population, and not to expect this.There are control for going for groceries to a supermarket.Where were the controls?Where were the fines and arrests.Where was the proactive, and not the reactive leadership?If the numbers increase, if the contagion curve rises, then restrictions will tighten.Franceschini can talk all he wants, but we will all miss summer. We have lost spring.I really hope we won't be in our homes all summer.VagabondaEdited: 7:00 pm, May 08, 2020 "
Sala was the one when this was starting told people to ignore the risk and go have a drink. If you're asking about arrests why wasn't he?Not just him. When this was starting and people asked for the borders to be closed. For schools to be closed. Why haven't the people who refused to do that been arrested? All of them have far more responsibility. You want to arrest people? Start with those with blood on their hands.This situation isn't because somebody went for a walk. The numbers of Lombardia now are that most of the people getting sick are getting sick at HOME. Sitting across the table from their wives or husbands. Or talking to their kids. If they do try more arrests and fines people will start asking why me and not the guy across the street? Unless you want the army shooting anybody in the street you better accept people are damn tired of being locked up and won't put up with it forever.

"“Due to lockdown, most of the transmission that’s actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household at family level,”This, of course, begs the question. How are family members who infect other family members being themselves infected? Obviously, OUTSIDE the home, either going to work or going shopping or socializing! In the future, school children may infect their parents, grandparents and siblings. The key to stopping the pandemic is to stop the virus BEFORE it enters the home."

"Hi GAC,The lockdown was announced a few days in advance of the actual lockdown. Many who were living northern Italy left the North to spend the lockdown at home in southern regions. They were required to self-quarantine at home, and they infected their families in the home.Sicily and Puglia begged that they not return home.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…https://www.corriere.it/economia/lavoro/20_m…Infections in Catania and Bari were directly linked to family members who had returned home.https:/…Vagabonda"
"YES! It was a huge mistake to allow these people to quarantine at home with family members, without first having been tested for the virus! They should have quarantined in requisitioned hotels, as was done in China (or not allowed to travel home). Similarly, ""cured"" patients from hospitals in Lombardia should not have been sent to case di riposo to complete their ""rehabilitation"", without first being tested for residual virus."
"Could have, would have, and should have; wisdom after the event.Many were detained in Salerno on their journey to Sicily.https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2…https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…Yes, it was a huge mistake to allow these people to quarantine at home with family members, but please remember that it was very early-on, no one fully understood the huge impact of what was happening, and that Italy was also the first European country to see a major surge in Covid-19 cases.Lucky for other western countries since then to have had the opportunity to watch, and to learn from Italy's experiences, including Italy's reopening.To date, some other western countries have been slow to respond, and that has resulted in unpreparedness, lack of testing, lack of contact tracing, and quite frankly increased deaths. And then economic crisis as a SECOND factor. Many seem to forget that you need to first be alive, and then deal with economy. Our old Italians always said that if you have health first, then the rest falls in place.Please also keep in mind that Italy is a democracy, and not like China. Does anyone anywhere really trust, or believe information from China?If China, or Russia, or Cuba assist Italy, then think Trojan horse. And that's not about the admirable front-line heroes helping Italy, but they are dispensable soldiers in the battle.But think about the image and gratitude that Italians might feel towards countries like Russia, China and Cuba that have offered assistance. Italians then feel indebted and grateful for their assistance It's all done to gain trust for future influence in our world that's so lacking in western leadership these days.We need to be really smart, and think if this is the direction we want to go.Going shopping? The only shopping has been shopping for food.I just want to be clear that we have not been socialising. We have been at home, and we have been in lockdown for months.To suggest, or to imply otherwise is really a bit offensive.Sicilians listened, and took the warnings to heart. Unlike the irresponsibility I've observed recently in Milan.Statistics are important, but you really only feel what's happening when you live it.Vagabonda"

Gene #1205Very trueThe crisis is pandemic like the virus
Frankly as I watch this go down in US my opinion based on nothing more than watching the reactions all over the world is the USA may have the most difficult year ahead of any country. Sorry I probably should not have ever responded at the post was directed at two experts here but I think Italy is responding way better than here in USA.
"GenePlease, let me say I did really appreciate your post. When I first read TexasAnglophile post, at the beginning I thought to answer the same you did. Covid19 is not Italian, nor Chinese or any others. It belongs to Mother Nature, who is acting silly sometime. On the other hand the crisis doesn't belong to Mother Nature. It's the expression of our frenetic style of life. I mean ours, of the human beings. The political differences aren't physical as Covid19 demonstrated to all of us.Now, what we have to learn is the sense of Community. We are all in the same Community when we share joy and pain. If one of my neighbours is in trouble I am also in trouble. I rented a shop to a family of bakers, and they paid every month without problems for years. Then the virus and the shop has been closed at first but then reopened because was considered essential activity.They didn't work as much as before and paying the rent was becoming difficult. I immediately reduced the rent by 50% and will be like that until necessary or I will reduce even more if needed. I can afford to live without the extra money, they will save their activity and will be able to cope with their business. To me having the shop empty is worse than earning a reduced rent.I know thousands of similar stories around. There are people shopping at the food market leaving some extra food they bought to other people who might need it.It's called “spesa sospesa” or “spesa SOSpesa”.... Search on Google. You'll be surprised.“Se puoi, lascia. Se non puoi, prendi” If you can, leave. If can't, take”.This is the best behaviour to survive a crisis all together.Lastly, do you really believe there is any difference being an expert? Expert only means to be eager to help someone who might need a good trip suggestion."
"#1208I entirely agree. From my close analysis of the news on television and the internet, Italy does indeed appear to be handling this crisis more responsibly than the United States (and particularly certain states of the U.S., which don't appear to be enforcing social distancing norms/wearing of face masks in venues such as beaches, parks, bars and restaurants recently reopened).Many leading American virologists and epidemiologists are terribly concerned that the ""next waive"" of Coronavirus this Autumn/Winter will deal a death blow to the U.S. Economy (as well as sicken and kill tens of thousands). ""The darkest winter in modern history""???I hope they are wrong, but fret that far worse may be just around the corner ...."
thanks for the comments...the comment really struck me..I think it is taking time for this to sink in with many in US that we are in the worst shape of any country and also in the worst position for reopening and potential second surge. Listening to the hearing with Dr. Bright today was terrifying. I live in a state that has yet to reach the peak and cases are rising and yet governor is opening the state up...why? Political pressure.

"Follow #1209Traditions consolidated over the centuries also contribute to make a Nation.The “Panaro” is a basket where people who can, leave some food to the people who can't. The word is from Latin “Panarum”, the basket where ancient Romans kept bread. This word is ancient like the usage of the panaro to keep food.During the centuries, some “panari” have always been left to the people in need by some other more lucky. But things evolve and the panaro is also known as the “spesa sospesa” (suspended shopping) or “caffè sospeso (suspended coffee). The tradition is still alive today, during Covid 19, and here is explained its history in plain English.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRc0PYFiK1w Anyway, there is one and only one truly traditional “panaro” like the one described in the following video (in Italian)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljlZDSx0VPc To show it is not only a behaviour but it is part of the Italian being, a journalist pretended to be poor as a social experiment to record the people reactions.He went to a shop and bough some bread, pasta and milk, very basic food for a total amount of 3.50 Euro. He pretended to have only 1.50 euro and no more money. While very few people ignored him, in the first half of the video, on the second half a huge number of people offered him to pay the two Euro difference, without being asked for, only to help someone in needs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcvtgAu9teQ On the following video, not a social experiment but true life, a man with no money bought some food, but he had no money with him.“Call the Police. He has no money” shout someone. “He didn't buy champagne or wine. This guy only bought some basic food to eat. He bought the essential but he has no money. Call the Police”.A man approached. What did you buy? Floor, milk, basic food to eat, the answer.I have no money. I am not working shout one man.Don't worry. We help you, not the State but us.

"Yes. Very sad.Life is almost restarting out in many places. In some too much like the Palermo Vucciria or the Milano Navigli. In some other too little like Rome downtown or any other touristic area.

"#1232. The movie shows a situation which has been aggravated but has been common, of people travelling great distances from outside the city, bus for hours then this... not being able to afford to live in the city, to work short hours. Cleaners are interviewed but we have met striking museum guides, graduates and beyond, in Naples in the past, having the same grievance, three hours by train for a two hour shift. This could be an opportunity to reform work hours for those less privileged. Not just supporting a different class of people who can work from home. The same situation in other countries too, where the least privileged are likely to remain ... the least privileged.That youtube movie is at the Anagnina station, first station on metro line A. The situation at later stations if spacing is maintained among passengers must be very difficult. https:/…35-mappa-metro-roma.html=====GAC 1231.

"Hi DennisI have been travelling with Linea A for years from Numidio Quadrato (Linea A) to Bologna (Linea B) changing Linea at Termini.Yes. The Metro is very busy but only during morning rush hours. From 7.00 am to 8.30 am is very difficult to get on the train in the downtown direction.To go uptown in the afternoon it wasn't like in the morning because there are no scholars returning home in the afternoon. When they do, from 01.00 pm to 02.00 on, office workers are still at work as they mostly return home from 5.00 pm to 6.00 pm. We should change the working hours to let i.e. schools open later reducing the people who need to move at the same time.The lady on the video was telling the necessity to restore night runs in order to be earlier at work. Before the shutdown, she used to get the night train leaving Anagnina at 4.30 am that has been suppressed at the moment.Most of the Metro problems were in the past years, but today, with air conditioning and a lot of other improvements, using the Metro is a lot better than when I used it. Still, rush hours are a problem not being resolved yet.I am sorry if I went off-topic because passengers traffic issue is probably better related to some other discussion ;-)"

Certainly this fact can't be ignored.

Good morning Vagabonda and allWe were talking yesterday in the Italian forum about the eventuality the virus might be diffused more than we believe.https:/…106683425The article I shared in the above link (post #1014) reports the evidence that the virus was circulating long before we believed. Before Feb 21st one blood donor on 20 had the presence of antibodies in the plasma. It means a huge number of people might have been infected without knowing.How many? Did we reach the herd immunity without knowing?To answer these important questions recently began a massive check of the population on a statistic base. 150K people of different age and gender will be extracted from the population database and will be contacted by phone to be subjected to specific analysis aimed at the detection of antibodies https://www.lastampa.it/cronaca/2020/05/10/n…I am confident (I hope) the situation might be better than we believe
"Ciao Raffaele,That was an interesting thread and article. The Sole24ore article with the four hypothetical scenarios is also very interesting.https:/…I have also read that the virus might have been here earlier than February. I've also read reports from other countries that seem to indicate that the virus might have been around as early as October.Studies are essential for an understanding of where we are at the moment, an idea of how many have been infected, if antibodies have been identified, about immunity and if it's permanent, and about herd immunity.I agree with you that it will be interesting to observe the contagion curve in the next weeks after incidences in Milano and Palermo, those not wearing masks and gloves, small parties, and family reunions.No one knows but time will tell. I hope you are correct in your optimism.Vagabonda"

"Anyway, before June 15th nothing is written on stones for June 3rd either.Things might change on a day by day basis and the final decision to reopen all Regions has not been taken yet. Lombardia and Piemonte might be one or two weeks late for the appointment.https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/fase…Google translatedPhase 2, reopening of borders at risk for Lombardy and PiedmontFrom 3 June, travel between the different regions should be authorized, but some in the North-West are at risk due to the high number of infections and the decision could shift by one or two weeks.The real knot between the government and the Regions on the reopening of the borders is on 3 June. It is on this date, in fact, that movements between different regions should be authorized. But not all of them could have the green light: Lombardy, Piedmont and perhaps even Emilia-Romagna could decide to postpone the reopening of a week or two. The reason is due to the high number of infections present especially in the North-West.The fundamental data to determine whether or not the movements can be authorized will arrive on May 29, but this will not be the day of the decision. The experts will take at least another 24-36 hours to see the trend of the curve and only then will the government meet: the decision is likely to arrive between 1 and 2 June.In fact, many different Southern governors fear the arrival of people from the areas most affected by the coronavirus. Under observation, therefore, always the North-West and in the end it is not at all excluded that the line of the two tracks can be followed: one for Lombardy (and for other regions at risk), one for the rest of Italy. ""The curve continues to bend on the right side, but caution is needed"", repeats the Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza.Even the Minister of Regional Affairs, Francesco Boccia, in recent days recalled that ""the move from June 3 will probably be allowed"" by monitoring and classifying the regions according to risk: low, medium or high risk. ""If a region is at high risk, it certainly won't be able to receive inputs from the others."""
"Grazie for the details Raffaele. Yes, it is a complicated situation everywhere.One thing puzzles me. Why does Lombardia continue to have such a high rate of infection at this point? I understand the higher density of living conditions and the fact that the region was the first breakout. What else is different about Lombardia that there is less progress with declining numbers?"
"SpelloVery good question!I believe is the same question that puzzles virologists in Italy too ;-)Maybe for several reasons and the first one is we must consider the virus not being over yet.Edited: 10:19 am, May 26, 2020 "

"Hi QQ2Sure. I agree. I reported a piece of news but my personal opinion is different.There is a rush to reopen borders as soon as possible mainly for economic reasons. I am afraid of doing it too early but I am not living on tourism. People are desperately looking at incomes from tourism, but I believe we (all EU) should wait at least until the end of June even simply to decide whether to reopen.Not to say that in Italy, income from tourism is 5% to 10% of all gross domestic product. To earn that low percentage we might lose the remaining 90% - 95% in a new lockdown."
@1272. - hello; this article is confusing (i think); it has been announced that Italy is opening its borders to EU travelers from 3 June - what is this talk now of 15 June? (From 15 June we are ready to receive foreign tourists)
"CountdowntofunI believe not only the article I posted is confused. All the ongoing situation is confused.Have you ever heard the phrase ""between saying and doing is the sea""? Well. This is mostly the case.Italy wants tourists to come to Italy to spend their money and will reopen borders on June 3rd at least to EU countries, Schengen, UK, and a few others.But borders have two sites: the internal where Italy decides and the external where other countries decide.So, the internal will reopen but not the external for example with Austria. German tourists will be able to go to Austria but they will not be able to go further to Italy. It's a very complex situation plus it's evolving on a day by day basis.IMHO I believe the final decision will be taken tomorrow, Monday, June 1st, because many regions are contrary to reopen borders between themselves, not to say to other countries.In Abruzzo, where I live, the situation at the moment is safe and under control and I would be the first to disagree to let in people from Lombardia, for example, or from other countries like the UK where the situation is getting better but has not been under complete control yet.We don't have to forget that the main problem with the virus are the asymptomatics, which are impossible to detect."

"Well...You have one full month before your trip. A lot can happen before then.I hope not being wrong but if the situation will stay with the actual downwards curve for new positives until at least June 15th, then you'll probably be fine and your trip will be fantastic.I believe if there were any negative effects from the may 18th easing, we should know by now.The best suggestion I can give you is to follow the numbers on Worldometers. The new cases in Italy are dropping a little every day from the previous one. You have four full weeks before leaving. Wait for the next two weeks and by June 15th you'll have more elements to make a decision.Hope it helps"

"I consider coming as a tourist from Belgium in mid July. More precisely I want to go to Corniglia (Cinque Terre in Liguria). Does anyone know what are the measures taken in the cadre of the coronavirus crisis? Can I freely sit on a terrace or go to a restaurant like before? Am I allowed to walk around without facemask? What about hotels? Does the measures are the same for the whole Italy or do they vary according to local government? Being not Italian, I have no idea. Could anyone clarify the situation?"

"#1335:According to some Italian media reports, those big new numbers of ""new cases"" in Lombardia are not necessarily worrisome, because they ALLEGEDLY represent people who were infected ""long ago"" and who were not able to get tested until very recently. If true, these ""new cases"" are really ""old cases"" which have merely been recently uncovered.COVID-related hospitalizations have been declining for over two months, which is very revealing (I don't know whether there have been NEW hospitalizations during this period, but if so, I assume that the numbers are quite low). Today's COVID-related hospitalizations are 12% of the peak number in early April.COVID-related intensive-care unit patients have been declining for 73 consecutive days, and now are only 5% of the peak number in early April."

"@USA_DrewThank you. I didn't reply to Travelin2014 because what he said is commenting itself...@ChefVery trueGiulio Gallera, Councilor of Welfare for Lombardia, states there is an optimistic explanation for the high numbers. Here it is:https://www.sondriotoday.it/attualita/corona…Google TranslatedCoronavirus, why is the number of new positives in Lombardy still so ""high""?How to interpret the data relating to the new positives. The explanation of the Lombardy Region Welfare Councilor Giulio Gallera.A 3.9% ratio, never so high for some time, between new positives and swabs. According to data provided by Pirellone, 256 other infections - 85% of all Italy - in a single day, between Sunday and Monday. But, again according to the region, there is an explanation that leads to optimism in the coronavirus emergency.In fact, the councilor for Lombard welfare, Giulio Gallera, spoke on the topic Monday evening, who explained that in relation to Monday, the new positives also include the results ""of 108 swabs carried out following serological tests, on health workers and on 17 guests of Rsa "".""Weakly positive cases""""Most cases - explained Councilor Gallera - are 'weakly positive'. This element highlights the presence of antibodies and traces of the virus, the onset of which dates back to the previous weeks, however. Regione Lombardia has decided to start a massive screening campaign with blood samples from quarantined citizens, contacts of symptomatics, health workers, law enforcement, court staff.In the case of a positive serological test, as per the procedure, a control swab follows, the result of which then falls within in official statistics. ""As for swabs, the junta exponent said, ""they are performed on citizens who turn to the emergency service, to patients in the hospitalization phase, to those who show even mild symptoms, and to their contacts, reported to Ats by general practitioners or employers ""."""" The expansion of the audience of the people to whom we are performing the swab, therefore - concluded Gallera - determines a greater number of positivity that in most cases is not linked to new outbreaks. This vast screening system serves precisely to prevent and monitor any critical situations, which at the moment the Ats experts do not highlight, especially if we consider the fact that we are one month after the end of the lockdown ""."""

"Now Denmark has finally opened its borders so that we can fly to Italy again. I have some questions: How about mask, I assume we should wear it in all public transport? But what about churches, museums, cafes, etc. We have a 4 hour stopover at an airport, we must have our mask at all times. I.e. that from the time we go into the airport in Copenhagen and until we are out of the airport of arrival in Italy, so we have to have it for a total of 12 hours? Is that it? We have the opportunity to book our trip to April or May next year. But what does it look like at that time, nobody knows? - there we may still have to wear a bandage. We do not use mask in Denmark. (Only at airports)so I'm very much in doubt. Anyone know anything about masks in Italy. ??"

"Are there any reports on how much tourist activity there is since the country opened its borders a week or two ago?Are the hotels and restaurants full, half-full, less than half full still?Are the popular tourist venues or the trains as busy or nearly as busy as they would normally be?For instance, there was a report that on the first day Spain opened its borders earlier this week, 100 planes arrived (not all international). Don't know how that compares to the number of flights which would normally arrive there this time of the year."
"A few lines about our recent trip by car from Austria to Venice (last weekend).We drove from Villach to Venice last Sunday, stayed 2 nights in Venice and 1 night in Cividale dei Friuli, came back via the same route. Just in case you were thinking of a short trip yourself, I would say... GO!!!The border control is totally removed, you just drive straight into Italy. Masks are obligatory in stores and restaurants but in restaurants only until you sit down to eat or drink. The LIFE GOES ON there, very much so!! Bars, shops, restaurants are open, but those in Venice (built for tourists) are almost emply, we felt special guests everywhere.This is unique time to observe local life (and hear only Italian speech) in tourist places such as Venice. It was simply unbelievable, we were at times the only outsiders on the streets of Venice. Contrary to popular belief, the life there is not slow, it is rather fast when you are in the middle of the crowd of locals rushing to their busy schedules :-)We took vaporettos (masks) and shopped, the hygiene rules are taken very, very seriously. In our hotels the hosts were always in masks when facing customers, hand desinfectors everywhere, masks obligatory during buffet breakfast.Otherwise, it is the same old Italy. Lovely, very much alive, loud, full of joy and emotion. We watched Italians talking on the headsets (mobile phones) through masks as if there was nothing different from normal ))"
"Thank you OlgaYour post is very informative.To reply Ag11 too, I have been to Rome last week and I can report also for Abruzzo, where I live. Life is slower than before lockdown but it's going on. Masks are mandatory in every closed spaces plus in open spaces where it is not possible to guarantee social distances. When you seat at the restaurant you can wear it off, like when you are walking along the streets. But, if the streets are crowded, masks are mandatory in open spaces too.If entering a shop or visiting a museum, you have to wait for your turn and for others to get out before you can go in. No more than one customer allowed at a time in smaller shops, but we are getting used to it.If you want to get a gelato, wait in a line outside the gelateria. Only when the previous customer got his gelato and went out you can go in and get yours.People are doing their best to comply with rules. To tell the truth I prefer to behave this way instead of before lockdown."
"Sorry KirstenThe previous post should be useful to answer your questions.Anyway, here are the current ruleshttps://www.thelocal.it/20200603/the-14-thin…Be prepared to allow people to measure the body temperature. It's not invasive. They use a Thermo scanner to measure the temperature near the forehead. When I go out I normally have my temperature scanned two or more times a day. Sometimes there is a video scanner before entering in big places like the Mall. They don't need to get close to you to check your temperature.Face masks need to be changed every 4 hours. Bring with you an adequate number before leaving.https:/…italy-new-rules-on-flying"

"#1368I see a problem with allowing restaurant customers to remove their masks for the entire duration of time that they are seated indoors. This is obviously justified by needing to eat and converse with table mates, but it also creates a danger that aerosolized virus may be shedded by multiple patrons in a small, enclosed space. The purpose of patronizing restaurants with friends is to socialize and talk, not merely to eat (otherwise, one would use the ""take-away"" feature). If the noise level inside increases, as often occurs, especially in the evening, people tend to raise their voices when conversing. This has the effect of increasing the amount of virus emitted (if they are positive to COVID-19). As many people stay at least one full hour inside the restaurant, there is ample time to spread the virus, in aerosolized form, to other patrons seated inside. Whether the virus has sufficient viral load to infect others is an open question (one which I would not wish to test personally).Consequently, I would refrain from eating at a restaurant unless the table is outdoors and separated by at least two meters from other tables."

"Any insight appreciated. Regarding Public Transport, as i understand from dfa.ie/travel/…Public transport is reopened (with given rules), however, bus lines such as SIT have their website saying they are not operating from Rome airport to city centre, as in line with the rules that people make their own way to their destination... Car hire isn't a feasible option.Would it be fine to board the flight to Rome, arrive and get a bus as per normal? Does it seem a possibility Italy may regress and re-enforce restrictions - seeing flights cancelled. Thankfully, unlike France, they don't require UK and EU citizens to self-isolate and the trip doesn't need to be of business purpose. Unfortunately can't get clarifications on queries from one particular source hence Tripadvisor."

"Hi Everyone,Are italians residing in the USA allowed to go back to italy? We have a small home in Tuscany and are supposed to go back in mid july to oversee renovations. We plan on staying for 12 weeks to have enough time to quarantine and oversee the work. I heard americans will continue to be banned but I am wondering if we italians can go."
"This is the language of the Governmental Decree effective June 11, 2020: ""Fino al 30 giugno 2020, restano vietati gli spostamenti da e per Stati e territori diversi da quelli dicui al comma 1, salvo che per comprovate esigenze lavorative, di assoluta urgenza ovvero per motividi salute. Resta in ogni caso consentito il rientro presso il proprio domicilio, abitazione o residenza.""Unofficial translation:""Until 30 June 2020, travel to and from States and territories different from those above (i.e. E.U./Schengen/U.K./Monaco/Andorra/San Marino/Vatican CIty) remains prohibited, except for proven work reasons, circumstances of absolute urgency, or for health reasons. In any event, entry (into Italy) to return to one's domicile, home or residence remains permitted.""The last sentence could be subject to interpretation. For example, does it allow entry into Italy to a U.S. or Italian citizen who resides in the U.S. for tax purposes but maintains a ""second home"" in Italy, where he/she spends 3-6 months per year? I don't know the answer. Would a ""circumstance of absolute urgency"" include travel to Italy to look after a vacation home (owned by the foreigner) which has been burglarized or subjected to an act of God (fire/flooding, etc.)?Moreover, those who ARE allowed entry into Italy pursuant to the above, who are NOT arriving from the E.U./Schengen/U.K./etc. must STILL abide by the 14-day quarantine requirement.We need to see what will happen AFTER June 30. It is quite likely that this date will be moved forward, in light of the E.U. determination not to allow entry to many non-E.U. country nationals.From my reading of the Decree, American citizens (who reside in the U.S. or outside of the E.U./Schengen/U.K./etc.) and even Italian citizens RESIDING in the U.S. CANNOT travel to Italy for tourism or leisure travel, but must qualify for one of the narrow exceptions noted above.It is likely that travel to Italy after June 30 will ""mirror"" the limitations recommended by the European Commission. That means that residents of certain foreign countries such as the U.S., Brazil, Russia and others will be banned except for the aforementioned narrow reasons.Edited: 9:14 am, June 27, 2020 "

"#1398I would read this article with a grain of salt. The article points out how different agents at the airports in New York, Paris and Rome all interpreted the ""rules"" and the ""exceptions"" differently! Different agents were satisfied with different kinds of documentation. After passing through the hoops at the first two airports, the traveler had to get through the police line at Fiumicino Airport, where the policeman who reviewed her papers apparently considered her property ownership in Italy sufficient reason for entry without additional justification. He was applying a ""literal"" interpretation of the language of the Italian Decree:""Resta in ogni caso consentito il rientro presso il proprio domicilio, abitazione o residenza.""""In any case, entry (into Italy) is allowed to return to one's domicile, home/habitation or residence.""I have a pretty good idea of the significance of ""domicile"" and ""residence"", but ""home/habitation"" seems to open up much broader possibilities, if interpreted literally.Would a different policeman have had a DIFFERENT, more restrictive, interpretation? Would a different policeman have considered the legal residence of the traveler (USA), and then looked at the ""urgency"" motivations? Would possession of an Italian or E.U. passport, or marriage to an Italian citizen, have made the decision easier (there are a small number of dual USA/Italy citizens).I think that the last sentence in the article is unnecessarily restrictive: First of all, if one adopts the ""literal"" interpretation of the language quoted above, property OWNERSHIP should NOT be required. Having a long-term rental contract should also suffice, documented by a copy of the rental agreement and a utilities billing statement. OWNERSHIP likely tends to demonstrate a closer ""contact"" with Italy than a mere rental and therefore should make for a stronger ""case"", but a long-term rental should also suffice, based on MY interpretation. (In fact, the policeman asked the traveler if she ""lived in Rome"", NOT whether she owned property in Rome).Secondly, the Decree also allows entry into Italy for reasons of ""extreme urgency"", even without property ownership or rental. What are examples of ""extreme urgency""? Each immigration officer might have a different opinion. Here are some examples which come to my mind which might pass muster:1. You need to travel to Italy for a contract signing ceremony which must necessarily be done in your physical presence and not by use of a power of attorney;2. Your apartment or house in Italy has been broken into or damaged by fire or flooding or other event, and you have no one on site to supervise repairs;3. Your parent, spouse, child, or other legal dependent is in the hospital (not COVID-related) and needs your presence;4. You need to file important legal documents in Italy which require your personal physical presence and can't be done by an agent or attorney-in-fact;5. You are running up against the deadline to file inheritance certificates and tax returns for a local decedent for whom you are next-of-kin, and the deadline cannot be extended.There are of course other reasons which might be offered as examples of ""exigencies"", but in each case, we simply don't know whether they would pass muster. The Decree may well have been intentionally drafted with a degree of ""vagueness"" to permit some flexibility of interpretation.I had a suspicion that property ownership might be a valid ""exception"" to the prohibition against travel to Italy, but was still concerned that the concept of ""legal residence"" might be a limiting factor (applying a narrow and restrictive interpretation). This particular U.S. citizen made it through, and that fact may give others in similar circumstances some hope of a similar outcome. Are you willing to run the risk of being turned away after arrival in Italy?Edited: 8:33 pm, June 28, 2020 "

"My heart hurts for everyone that is losing their income and livelihood due to loss of business from lack of tourism. Our plans were changed to go to Italy hopefully now next May/June. I pray that by then our numbers are all stable and this virus will be behind us. I hate that we as Americans can't travel to Italy at this time, but at the same time I completely understand. The area I live in has had multiple spikes lately in numbers of positive cases and mandates are being given out yet again for our area. We have so many that are coming to our area from other states due to vacation at our beaches, so I am sure we are going to have so many more test positive in the coming weeks.

"Hi guys,Just checking in one more time. In the meantime, we've booked our stay at Como for next week (also thanks @Raffaele for your earlier advice).I was just wondering how the whole obligation to wear masks outside is being handled right now in Lombardy? I know that people, in theory, should wear them even at the beach, etc. That being said, I've talked to another friend who currently stays around Milan an according to him, people don't seem to care very much/don't have their masks on outside at the promenade, etc.Any other ""inside information""?"

I have one week vacation in last week of July. I was thinking a trip either to Capri Island or Sicily? How are things going in those places? Is one of those places more like back to usual life? Are restaurants and other places open? Do they still have some restrictions in public transport etc.? Or should I postpone my trip altogether and go to Greece instead?
"JuhaNowhere in Italy, life is back to where it was before the outbreak. Life is restarting, one step at a time.If you wish to go to Capri or to Sicily, being an EU Citizen, you can. Just follow some additional rules to register yourself if you decide to go to Sicily as reported here italia.it/en/…tourism-restarts-in-italy.htmlMany places and many restaurants are open and there are no restrictions on public transport other than social distancing and wearing masks rules.If you decide to go to Italy now, postpone or go to Greece, it's your choice."

I still remember the pronunciation of an Alitalia steward some 30 years ago:""Dis is your a dinner, I don't a know if its a good""Nevertheless, when Italians mispronounce English, it often has a musical, melodic quality.Americans always mispronounce ""ci, ce, chi, che, gi, ge, ghi, ghe, gn"" and so forth. They also often get the accent on the wrong vowel. Unfortunately, those lucky few Americans who still study Latin today (using the ""restored classical"" pronunciation) also end up mispronouncing Italian.

"It's my turn to ask for your advice, dear travelers. I'm a Romanian citizen intending to visit Italy at the end of July by plane. At this moment, the coronavirus cases in Romania are dramatically increasing and everyone predicts that Romanians might be banned to enter some EU countries starting with 1 August, including Italy. So, here's my question: if I enter Italy before any restriction announcement, would I be affected by any decision taken afterwards such as self-isolation or quarantine ? Usually, these kind of measures do not imply retroactive effects, but I just want to be sure."
"AlexI don't know what August 1st will be, but measures are never retroactive. If you are in Italy before then and you have no symptoms, you'll be fine.Obviously you'll have to respect all the measures imposed by the Italian Government while in Italy, like wearing masks, washing hands and else. If the Romanian or the Italian Government will impose restrictions, they will be applied to people on their territory at the given moment, not because of their nationalityEdited: 3:25 am, July 17, 2020 "

I am curious if you think that this means a US citizen can enter Italy as long as they do self-quarantine or if they provide the self-declaration form then they don't have to self-quarantine.
Is it simply my citizenship or residency in the US that prohibits me from visiting Italy? What if I visit the UK and self-quarantine with a friend for 14 days? Residents of the UK can freely visit Italy. Then can I visit Italy with my friend from the UK? It makes no sense to me that I can't enter Italy based solely on my citizenship or residency. Can someone answer this question for me??
"GAC - what do you think? I think I found my own answer! It seems to me I could self-quarantine in the UK and fly to Italy no questions asked and no quarantine required based on this statement: ""These are the principal new measures in force from July 1:travel within the Member States of the European Union will continue to be unrestricted (in addition to Italy the following Countries are EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden), Schengen Members States (non-EU Countries that are Schengen Members States are: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Andorra, Principality of Monaco, Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State.

"#1487The restrictions and prohibitions on entering Italy are based on RESIDENCY and NOT on CITIZENSHIP. Hence, a U.S. Citizen who RESIDES in the U.S. (or indeed, outside of ""Europe"" as defined below) cannot enter Italy except in EXTREMELY narrow circumstances (but NOT for tourism or leisure), whereas the same U.S. Citizen who RESIDES legally in the E.U., the U.K., Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, or Vatican City (collectively, ""Europe"") may lawfully enter Italy for any reason and without any quarantine restriction (UNLESS he has sojourned outside of ""Europe"" in the previous 14 days).RESIDENTS of countries on Italy's ""green list"" (which include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, plus a few more) CAN enter Italy for tourism or any other lawful purpose, BUT MUST QUARANTINE FOR 14 DAYS. The quarantine requirement MAY be satisfied in any other country of ""Europe"" as defined above. Therefore, RESIDENTS of countries on Italy's ""green list"" (including U.S. RESIDENTS) may enter Italy without any quarantine requirement if they have already satisfied the quarantine in, for example, the U.K (or any other country in ""Europe"" as defined above). As far as concerns U.S. RESIDENTS, they must find a country in EUROPE (as defined) which will allow them entry, with or without a quarantine requirement. However, the E.U. specifically prohibits entry to U.S. RESIDENTS, unless they also hold a Passport from one of the other countries of ""Europe"".U.S. RESIDENTS who ALSO hold European passports (as defined above), MAY enter Italy for any lawful purpose, but subject to a 14-day quarantine, which may be satisfied in a different country of Europe (as defined above).The rules get even more technical, but the foregoing is a sufficiently broad explanation, I think!https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…Edited: 12:25 pm, July 18, 2020 "

"Thank you, GAC, for the clarification! That is what I was thinking as well. Of course, this is purely hypothetical for me.

"#1515You really need to run this by the Italian Consulate. I believe that there is a pretty good argument that a US Person (NOT holding an E.U./U.K./Schengen passport) who lawfully enters Croatia for tourism and spends 14 days there, would thereafter gain access to Italy for any reason and without a need to quarantine. But there is also an argument that this would circumvent the spirit of the Regulation that limits entry into Italy for U.S. Persons in only VERY limited circumstances (and not for tourism). In any case, the recommended E.U. restrictions for travel of U.S. Persons to Europe make it quite difficult for such persons to enter an E.U. country for tourism in the first place, unless a particular E.U. country has created more exemptions or loosened the restrictions."

Is there any reasonable way of projecting what the situation will be in October or November for US citizens to travel to Italy? I am still holding out hope for a late fall trip and wondering if that is a total waste of time.
"William, in my opinion you need to take a very hard and realistic look at your own state for the answer. Sorry but that is the reality. No one is happy about this virus. It has upended all of our lives in different ways and to various degrees. Just hope a year from now things will be better worldwide."
"#1525Nobody can say, except that at the moment the situation is getting worse throughout much of the world, including in the United States (as you well know), and governments are tightening rather than loosening the travel entry regulations. Just in the U.S., the death count is increasing by 1,000 per day, and new contagions by 60,000 + per day.Italy has already promulgated three ""turns of the screw"" to its Entry Regulations in the current month, and the current Minister of Public Health is generally desirous of sponsoring protective legislation to safeguard Italian residents. This includes the 14-day quarantine requirement, which applies to countries on the ""green list"", plus Bulgaria and Romania (both E.U. countries) effective yesterday, plus to E.U./Schengen/U.K. Citizens and Residents who have sojourned outside of the E.U./Schengen/U.K. in the 14 days prior to entry into Italy. The United States is NOT on the ""green list"", nor on the ""free circulation"" list (E.U., minus Bulgaria and Romania, plus Schengen and U.K.)In addition, many public health professionals are expecting to see a ""second waive"" of infections this autumn/winter, making travel later this year quite uncertain/unlikely.Worst case, we may currently be experiencing a narrow ""window of opportunity"" to travel to Italy for leisure (mainly for E.U. citizens/residents, but not for residents of the United States), which may begin to close later this year.It's certainly OK to have aspirational plans to visit Italy in the near term, but don't hold your breath. I certainly would recommend against purchasing any plane tickets or making any hotel reservations at this time.Edited: 4:28 pm, July 25, 2020 "

"UNITED KINGDOM RE-IMPOSES 14-DAY QUARANTINE FOR PERSONS ARRIVING FROM SPAINIn yet another blow to the recovery of intra-European tourism, Britain announced today an immediate re-imposition of a 14-day quarantine for all persons arriving from Spain (many of whom are British tourists returning home). Britain also advised its citizens to avoid all but essential travel to Spain (excluding the Canary and Balearic Islands, which nevertheless remain subject to the quarantine).What does this have to do with Italy? PLENTY. It is yet another, very significant, example of a major European country which has ""tightened the screws"" against the free circulation of persons. It is a very major blow to Spanish tourism, coming from Spain's foremost provider of foreign tourists.Italy also has been ""tightening the screws"" to its own travel Regulation, and more restrictions can be expected in the weeks to come as the COVID-19 pandemic refuses to go away.This summer's European travel season may be experiencing only a fragile, temporary and partial recovery.https:/…20200725183049-n4hcl"
The events as outlined by GAC is a perfect example of the risks of trying for that summer vacation this year . Now people who have arranged with employers etc. for a one week vacation will find they will need a three week vacation. I sort of expected that anything short of just staying in your country would be risky...

"Quick question GAC and Raffaele.... I have a very good friend from Rome who is currently in Sweden and he is posting photos of himself having a fantastic time. Virtually no social distancing, no masks, no hygeine practices.. he is a smart, warm, compassionate man. When he first arrived there (complete with masks galore and the intent to practice good actions) he was freaked out by how complacent everyone was. A week later he is one of them. I think it just is a case of intellectually knowing what is good for you and emotionally falling victim to 16 weeks of isolation and the desperation for a sense of “life as it was”.Will he have to quarantine upon return to Roma? And if not, I think it’s quite evident we will never conquer this virus. Sweden has more active cases per million residents, then the United States. Herd immunity has not worked."

Hi DiamondloverSweden is a Member State of EU. It means that your friend can enter Italy without having to quarantine.Whether Sweden has adopted the best solution I cannot answer. I know what's going in Sweden only by reading news on the Internet. Sorry.
We are booked for Italy in September (air only). We booked right before Covid hit so luckily had not booked all of our travel arrangements. Our air is on Lufthansa. So far the flights are still active although they have changed the times by an hour or two. Has anyone been successful in getting a refund from them? I have been waiting to call but I'm pretty sure at this point American's will NOT be traveling to Italy in September! :)Thanks for any insight or experience you have to share.
"I was booked on Lufthansa for a trip in March. As things began to get bad, I was advised to wait it out to see if LH would cancel. And they did a week before departure, entitling me to a full refund. After many emails and one complaint to USDOT, I finally got my refund in July. Of course the airline was in bad financial straights, which I understood. You may be in a different situation since LH may very well keep the flight going, in which case your ticket is nonrefundable (I assume). In March countries were closing borders, today they’re opening them. Talk to them to get your options (voucher maybe?), but it may be best to just wait and see."

"My thoughts are with the Italian people.In the UK many people seem to think that it is over - Tesco have removed queuing to enter, the one way system & don't seem to know if they have removed the single queue for the checkout. Most of the supermarkets have refused to enforce the compulsory face coverings, which unfortunately is not even mandatory in NI (until tomorrow toothlessly or 20th August in reality)!Apologies if I appear to digress, but I want to ask how similar issues are being handled in Italy? Also what is the feeling with regards to tourists (especially those from the UK & Ireland)? Are they bringing much needed money or selfishly risking bringing Coronavirus?"
"My thoughts are with the U.K. people.I read in the news that new restrictions were imposed especially in Greater Manchester, some parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire. Apparently, in Italy, nothing has changed since May 3rd, when the lockdown has been eased. We Italians are compulsory to wear masks when inside building or using transport means. In some circumstances also in open spaces. We must wash our hands and everything else. We are doing our best to comply with the rules. Some people obviously are not, but fortunately, they are only a minority.We have also others problems like immigration from North Africa out of control. New measures were adopted for people incoming from Romania and Bulgaria. The ban remains for festivals, fairs, and indoor dancing.Anyway, to my knowledge, there are not any negative feelings against people from other countries. If tourists are wearing masks while inside closed spaces and do not endanger public safety, they are most welcome."

Currently our government only allows us to travel to 'green listed' countries in which Italy is one of them, but they review this list every 2 weeks!

This is the BIGGEST DAILY INCREASE IN NEW CASES SINCE MAY 28, and a 247% increase in four days. THE NUMBERS ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.The daily increase in new cases is about twice as high in Germany and the U.K., five times higher in France, and nearly eight times higher in Spain.New cases = the increase in total cases. Total cases as officially reported are now 249756. Total cases include deaths and ""cured"" persons.Veneto registered the largest number of new cases (183 cases = 33.2%), followed by Lombardia (69 cases = 12.5%) and Emilia-Romagna (54 cases = 9.8%), and not a single region reported zero new cases.Deaths increased by 3 in the past 24 hours, compared to an increase of 6 yesterday. Total deaths as officially reported are 35190.The national death rate as officially reported is now 14.09%.The number of hospitalized, non-ICU, patients, increased by 17 to 779, a bit higher than the low of 705 on August 1. ICU patients were stable at 42, which represents 1.03% of those at the beginning of April, when the number of ICU cases reached its peak."
"From the Guardian on Italy's recent increase in cases:The number of daily new coronavirus infections in Italy jumped 38% higher on Friday, with 552 confirmed cases registered compared to the previous day.Italy has not seen a such a high daily new caseload since late May. Barely two weeks ago, Italy had been registering roughly 200 new cases a day, the Associated Press reports. The northeastern region of Veneto, which performed nearly 16,500 swab tests in a day, registered roughly a third of those new cases 183.Veneto governor Luca Zaia said the new infections were found in residents who recently returned home from Spain, Peru, Malta, Croatia and Greece.Vacations are a risk,” he said in his daily briefing. Everyone must decide where they want to go on vacation, but it’s also true, that by us, for a couple of weeks now, we’re seeing a concentration of patients who were infected on vacation.’’"

"The problem of overcrowded commuter trains in Italy:https:/…This article illustrates the knotty problem which unreserved commuter trains pose in parts of Italy: overcrowding, impossibility to respect social distancing rules, not all passengers consistently wearing face coverings, many passengers forced off the train at one station, only to fill up again at the following station.This particular train was a Trenitalia Regionale traveling in the morning from Ventimiglia (French border) to Genova, with many stops en-route. When the train reached Alassio, 80 passengers were required to disembark (to take a special supplemental train bound for Genova), yet the very same train, now running late, filled up once again at the next station, Albenga! Many passengers reportedly did not wear face coverings, and the train was so crowded that a few passengers reportedly ""found hospitality"" in the train conductor's quarters!While the article may contain a few slight exaggerations and colorful references, nevertheless, it does illustrate a serious challenge for government officials who are trying so hard to reduce opportunities for COVID-19 contagion on public transport. The same problem almost certainly also exists on some city buses, especially in the larger cities and during rush hour. Next month, when schools reopen, the situation will only get worse."

"As we wait for today's updated COVID-19 numbers for Italy, here are a couple of news reports from today's La Repubblica internet edition, which address some of the sources of new contagions in Italy:1. Young Italians (including persons celebrating their high school graduation) returning from group holidays in Croatia, Greece and Malta infected with COVID-19. In one case, 5 out of 10 teenagers returning from Greece tested positive upon their return to Puglia. In another case, 11 young persons tested positive upon returning to the Province of Arezzo (Tuscany) from Corfu. In yet another case, 8 young persons tested positive upon returning to Lazio from a vacation on Malta. And the article cites several more examples.https:/…2. Hundreds of tourists (mainly Italians) flocking to Stromboli (Aeolian Islands) with no regard for social distancing any many not wearing face coverings:https:/…The articles point out the risks and dangers surrounding the movement of persons within Europe for purposes of tourism. I have not yet personally seen news reports of European tourists returning infected to their home countries after vacationing in Italy, but I suppose that such cases do exist. I know of such cases tied to vacations in some other European countries.Today's Corriere della Sera internet edition has two interesting articles, one stating that there has been an upsurge in COVID-19 contagions in Italy (and in the US) in the past 30 days among persons under 18; the second noting that Italy is ""surrounded"" by several other European countries with high contagion rates (yet tourism to and from these countries is completely open, without a quarantine requirement).www.corriere.it"

"Thank you TravelTomVery nice video and very nice beach.At least, for today, we already had our daily video about the situation in Italy :-)Well done @GACI am holding my breathAnother lockdown will be devastating"
"We are very concerned about increased numbers, and many of us are holding our breaths fearful of another lockdown in autumn.Increases were expected as we reopened, and also with the start of tourism, but we have still thankfully sustained low numbers so far, and especially when compared to other European countries.So why such naysayer reports here, and especially pertaining to youth?We deserve a pat on the back for what we've accomplished from Europe's first and worst at the onset of this pandemic to where we are now.It's not as if there aren't indiscretions elsewhere, perfect management/testing elsewhere....When Italy reported 259 new cases, the US reported 45.959.Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.Our numbers will probably increase, and we might sadly face another horrible lockdown.I disagreed with the decision to open borders to tourism, but at some point we needed to test the waters, and reopen after months of a stringent lockdown.

Neither is responsible...But do you want to compare this...https:/…...to this?https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-wit…Why the constant negativity with reports about Italy?Vagabonda
"#1609:QUOTE:""So why such naysayer reports here, and especially pertaining to youth?""I would direct your question to the authors of the several news reports circulating on Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica (and other Italian media, including television) which are widely reporting this information, and indeed pointing a finger precisely at (but not exclusively to) Italian youths, as well as to other factors.The situation in the US concerning young people is the same, except worse (it's also a question of relative numbers of inhabitants), and it includes plenty of highly regrettable, risky and/or irresponsible conduct by older persons as well. Of course, most people ARE respecting the precautions, and are being conscientious, both in Italy and in the US, but unfortunately suffer the consequences of the few outliers.And I do agree that Italians have suffered greatly from the rigid lockdown, and are deserving of some respite.I also worry about the public transportation COVID-19 risk for Italy, which will only be exacerbated when schools reopen next month and students and commuters being to fill up buses, commuter trains and metros."
"And I worry about my family in the US, and California.And YES, ""most people ARE respecting the precautions, and are being conscientious, both in Italy and in the US"", but there is an obsession here with focus on the minority negative.Vagabonda"
"#1612You raise an interesting point about ""obsession""."
You should talk!Vagabonda
"Sadly for Italy, it was the first truly open country to deal with COVID. It was Italian doctors who first shared with the world all they learned about the disease as they struggled to treat the floods of patients presenting in Italian hospitals. The rest of us are greatly in your debt.Nearly six months later, much more is known about the progress of the illness, new treatments have been developed, and a higher percentage of people survive it here in the US than did back in March and April. Surely that is true in Italy as well.Yet your losses have been horrific, including the economic losses you are still experiencing. I grieve with my Italian friends; I also salute you for your steadfast perseverance through great difficulty."
"The people here are reporting the current situation in Italy, how they see it, how they read it in the newspapers, how they live it.No more, no less.I'm afraid the real problems will arise when the schools will reopen on September 14th. And it has nothing to do with young people."
"#1616I have to very respectfully disagree with the statement that the Coronavirus situation has nothing to do with young people. Quite to the contrary, it is sad and distressing when I read dozens and dozens of news stories and watch numerous television news reports which note that the average age of contagion has been rapidly going down over the past several weeks, both in Italy and in the United States, and elsewhere. There was a report in Corriere della Sera yesterday that the percentage of new cases in Italy involving persons under the age of 18 has increased tenfold. Contributing to this increase seems to be young persons taking vacations, both domestically and abroad, and otherwise socializing, and not taking adequate precautions, and/or frequenting high-risk activities.I have absolutely nothing against young persons. I myself was once a young person. Indeed, I am delighted to see that the boundless curiosity of young persons often prompts them to want to travel, experience new things, visit new countries, learn new languages, etc. I think it's great for young persons to travel for leisure as well as to further their education. I encourage young persons to travel to Europe, to Italy, to enrich themselves and return home as more knowledgeable and well-rounded individuals.Just today, I saw this report, which summarizes the analysis of a group of medical professionals, and which ranks activities by risk of COVID infection:https:/…Notice the top ten risky activities:1. Bars and nightclubs2. Indoor parties3. Nightclubs4. Religious services5. Watching sports6. Playing contact sports7. Movie theatres8. Air travel9. Public transportation10. GymsNot all of these activities represent the domains of young persons, but some do have high concentrations of younger adults and teenagers, such as public transportation which attracts large numbers of school-age children (and this becomes problematic when schools return in session).It must be stated that older persons are ALSO responsible for a certain percentage of new cases. I'm not letting them off the hook. Indeed, I am even more outraged when older/mature persons demonstrate poor judgment, and am much less inclined to excuse them than young inexperienced persons.Everybody needs to maintain a very high level of caution and refrain from risky practices and activities which increase the risk of COVID-19 contagion. Younger and older alike.Edited: 7:42 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Just to be clear, young persons who attend school and/or take public transportation to or from school or university are not to blamed for exacerbating COVID-19 contagion, as long as they practice safe conduct (wearing masks and avoiding close contact where possible). The same is true of adults commuting to work or running errands on public transportation.Perhaps that is what was meant by the statement ""it has nothing to do with young people"" in connection with the reopening of schools. If so, I agree.In the list of risky activities above, point 3 should read ""attending a concert"" and not ""nightclubs"" (which is point 1). My mistake.Edited: 8:32 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Thanks ever so much TexasAnglophile!Yes Raff, reporting how we see and live it. We both know kids who follow the guidelines. Your positive post after each daily stat update hasn't gone unnoticed. Grazie mille!The average age of contagion has been younger, so we are concerned about school reopening.The top ten risky activities aren't limited to youth by any stretch of the imagination.Poor judgment and indiscretions aren't the monopoly of youth.https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sturgis-south-…Vagabonda"
"@GACWe are on the same side.I believe young people have nothing to do in spreading the virus. It's our fault as parents if the youngsters are mean of contagion. That's why I am concerned with school reopening. Believing all the kids will strictly follow the social distancing rules is unnatural if not impossible. As conscious parents, we should avoid our kids being forced to sit in a classroom for 6 hours without getting closer to less than one meter from each other. With teenagers is different. They should have the age to discern what is right and what is wrong. But we both know teenagers. That strange mixture, complementary to hormones, composed of immaturity and unconsciousness, which is added to a high presumption of invincibility and immortality ...Like, sadly, many adults too...The news shared by Vagabonda is the best evidence"

"#1623You are probably aware that Canada is already on Italy's ""White List"" of countries whose RESIDENTS (regardless of citizenship) are allowed to enter Italy for any lawful reason, but with a 14-day quarantine requirement, which obviously makes leisure travel there very problematic for the vast majority of persons. Nevertheless, I have already seen reports of numerous Canadian residents who have recently entered Italy for tourism or other reasons, and satisfied the quarantine requirement with patience.For the benefit of other readers, this is the complete list of countries outside of EU/Schengen/UK which are currently on Italy's ""White List"":Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay.The ""White List"" has been whittled down of late, and Italy continues to make frequent modifications to its Entry Regulations, so it's important to consult them periodically if planning to travel to Italy from those countries. Even residents of EU/Schengen/UK need to look at the Entry Regulations before traveling to Italy, because changes have already been made (e.g. Bulgaria/Romania), and more restrictions may well be implemented in the near term (such as quarantine or COVID-19 testing requirements)."
"Hullo Diamondlover,Does 'green light' means you will not be obliged to pass 14-day sel-isolation?Or you mean only the entry to Italy allowed for Canadians?If you are quarantined would you please share your experience, any rules imposed.Still no possibility to find any precise official information. Even the Embassy of Canada i Rome has sent me only general infos based on those available on web.Still hope to be able to travel to Sicily this September.Many thanks in advance."

In a separate incident, another 6 young adults tested positive after returning home from Greece.Puglia has very recently seen an upsurge in reported cases (after many days of zero cases).

Maybe I missed it but can a Greek passport holder come to Puglia for vacation and not quarantine or are they required to quarantine for 14 days? I assume that must be the case if the Italians coming from Greece must do so.
"Again thank you Raffaele R for your uplifting posts, and I hope you continue with these positive postings.As Raff wrote, we aren't completely safe, who is really?We need some balance to keep us grounded. There's just so much negativity we can sustain.Yes, unfortunately there were 412 new cases in Italy; someone's husband or wife, mother or father, sister or brother, family member, friend or colleague. There's never any mention of the human side with statistical posting.And there were sadly 46.436 new cases in the US as well as a staggering 1.179 deaths today, and an almost unimaginable 167 371 total deaths, and an overall unfathomable 5.297.998 cases in the US.And still, the negativity here.And that when we access, and make tough decisions and changes constantly.I fully know, appreciate and understand these numbers as my family and friends are included in the overall numbers for cases and deaths. Yes, deaths. How incredible that my family has sustained trans-Atlantic deaths, and health care professionals in my family have been impacted on both sides of the Atlantic.This isn't just about statistics or posting for me. It's personal.Information is readily accessible globally...https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Puglia suffered increased cases with those returning home from Milano when the quarantine was first announced. It's nice to see the lesson learned, and a response now. Both Puglia and Sicilia begged those in the North not to return home and infect us. They did, but it was far worse in Puglia.Some other regions need to take a closer look and respond.So back to the earlier threads...There's poor judgment and indiscretions with kids and adult.Keep in mind that we have an elderly population. I have read articles discussing young people to find references in the article about 20, 30, 40, and even 50-year olds. These aren't kids.And there's also mixed messages. Italy has opened our country to tourism, those from countries not following guidelines similar to ours llike mask-wearing, and beaches and restaurants were opened. Resume life? No.Consider the sun and sangria brigade returning to the UK from Spain, and then riding public transport o arrival in the UK to their unsupervised 14-day quarantine at home. And yet, we opened Italy to tourism.Consider Italy opening offices, and workers on public transport.And schools are soon expected to reopen.Consider the asymptomatic carriers, and also that more testing/identification registers increased numbers.Apparently an issue for those who thought cases didn't exist if not tested, and numbers didn't increase because of the testing.Good that Italy and it's regions constantly access the situation, and make tough choices and decisions, and the necessary changes, and that we tighten restrictions for protection.It's hard work for us all including parents of young school-aged children concerned about protecting our kids, parents of invincible-thinking teens, those riding public transport to work, those so horribly and negatively impacted by the faltering economy, those concerned about a second horrific lockdown, and on and on....Vagabonda"

The plan also contains a 'checklist' for the regions, ""to assess the level of preparedness of the health systems in the Regions / PPAA in order to be able to optimally face any increase in the number of new infections"".Monitoring for Rsa - The required requirements concern all aspects of health care, from the hospital network, which for example should have dedicated paths in the Emergency Department for suspected cases, to territorial medicine, with indications for example for Rsa, which should have an established and operational ""epidemiological and clinical surveillance and monitoring system that allows the early identification of suspected cases of COVID-19 among residents and operators within each facility and timely transfer to hospitals or hotels intended for individuals positive.

"Yes, Vagabonda. My sympathies lie with you. I lost my beloved mother to Covid 19, on Mothers Day. She was much more than a statistic. Italy is also so, so much more than statistics. It is like my Mum was....beautiful, welcoming, warm, hospitable and courageous. I miss them both so much.Keep up the happy videos, Raff."
"Heartfelt thanks to you Raff. You brought a tear to my eye. I sometimes think of the optimism we all have as we start a new year, even last New Year's Eve, and I am grateful for not knowing then what would be ahead of us this year. This has truly been a challenging year. I am so proud of my family who endured so much on the frontlines of fighting this pandemic from doctors/immunologist to nurses in the ER and ICU, and to family members who faced death alone, and the rest of us who tried to offer support when, and however we could.And how brave those volunteers to test vaccines.There are several hopeful and very promising vaccines.I read today though that there's international skepticism at the short test times and limited subjects with the Russian vaccine. We have thankfully better learned about treatment and care, and hopefully we'll also soon have an effective vaccine.And then also hopefully some semblance of normalcy and our former lives.It's hard on so many; on the ill and their families; on families with children facing the upcoming school year, on the elderly, on family businesses, on those economically challenged, and on everyone feeling so insecure about our future and wondering about another lockdown, and really that's all of us.Vagabonda"
"You know Raff, despite all the comments, and all the knocks of incompetency Italy sustains, we went from the first and the worst in Western Europe to the best with this virus; we sacrificed and we endured a grueling lockdown, and we are now accessing our current situation, and addressing what we need to do, and that despite our ""reputation: for incompetency, irreverence and breaking rules.

And still you are supportive on these forums for others.We really do need to support each other; to provide information and facts/statistics, but also have some heart with it all, some caring....We are losing our family members. It not just daily statistical reports. It's our family, friends, and colleagues behind each number. Perhaps it's easy to lose sight of that if you are comfortably sitting at home looking at data, and not feeling any pain.There's a lot of pain out there for a lot of people for a lot of reasons. Count yourself extremely blessed if it's not you.Vagabonda"
#1642Of course every single COVID-19 death is a tragedy and every single COVID-19 contagion is an extremely worrying event.Of course persons who have so far escaped the Pandemic are blessed.Who is to judge who is feeling pain and who is not? Who can confidently read the minds and hearts of others?
No one is judging what's in someone's heart.Some struggle more to show feelings.Thanks for that posting GAC.Vagabonda
"UPDATED CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS FOR ITALY as of August 12, 17:00 Italy time:https:/…salute.gov.it/portale/…(click on ""ultimo aggiornamento sulla situazione in Italia"")NEW cases increased by 481 in the past 24 hours, compared to an increase of 412 yesterday. Over the past 15 days, new cases have ranged from a low of 159 (August 2) to a high of 552 (August 7). The average increase in new cases in the past 7 days is 417.New cases = the increase in total cases. Total cases as officially reported are now 251713. Total cases include deaths and ""cured"" persons.New cases are spread out amongst numerous regions, ranging from high of 102 in Lombardia and 60 in Veneto, to zero in three regions. Many of the new cases are reportedly attributable to Italians returning from European vacations, especially from certain countries now under observation by Italian health authorities. Some regions have implemented additional safeguards and restrictions to combat this phenomenon.Deaths increased by 10 in the past 24 hours, compared to an increase of 6 yesterday. Total deaths as officially reported are 35225.The national death rate as officially reported is now 13.99% (down from a high of 14.53% on June 20).The number of hospitalized, non-ICU, patients dropped by 22 to 779, a bit higher than the low of 705 on August 1. ICU patients inched up by 4 to 53, which represents 1.30% of those at the beginning of April, when the number of ICU cases reached its peak. The lowest ICU count was 38 on July 29.NOTE: When reporting statistics concerning deaths and hospitalizations, it becomes all too easy to forget that the ""numbers"" represent a great deal of human anguish and suffering. There are real persons and families behind these numbers, and we do not forget that fact as we review the daily reports. Moreover, as this thread and this forum concern Italy, no attempt is made to place the ""Italian"" COVID-19 numbers in context with other countries, nor to make comparisons."
"On post #1936 I shared a piece of news about a vaccine developed in Italy and ready for testing on humans.Here we go. The first 90 volunteers are ready. The vaccine name is GRAD COV 2 and, hopefully, will be widely available by Spring 2021Sorry, video in Italianhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0s8vmMEmf8"
"I would like to thank everyone that has been posting on this link, especially those in Italy reporting on the conditions there and for GAC and his daily updates. My family in Italy is elderly, have no internet connectivity and so I rely on slow mail to communicate with them. I have depended greatly on this forum for helping me to stay up to date with the conditions there that have been reported from the heart.. My heart goes out to all who have lost a dear one."
Hi NashWhere about is your family living in Italy?
"Hi all, I'm booked to leave Ireland this Sunday and flying into Milano, where I will explore Venice, Verona, lake Garda etc. For about 1.5 weeks. Italy is currently on our green list, deemed save to travel and exempt from quarantine upon return, however I'm watching the figures slowly increase in Italy per day...and now I don't know how certain Italy will remain on the green list!!! And I'm slowly contemplating not going now, as it may be taken off the list whilst over there...but I'm a form believer that Italy are doing a great job trying to keep Covid under control and personally I feel safer there than at home!"
Most of the new cases refer to young Italians who have returned from holidays in Greece or Croatia. To these are added the cases found in the reception centers of refugees who continue to arrive in Southern Italy.
"It was not smart to open travel. It seems (to me) that the best time for travel may have already past. However and wherever cases originate, numbers and conditions are continuously monitored and assessed, and there's no hesitation implementing further restrictions. Thank you for today's update and thoughtfully-written post GAC. Especially appreciated is your notation. And yes, these are the Italy forums, and your gentle nudge to keep it about Italy is fair, and appropriate. This pandemic has impacted us all, and we all feel it in some way, and we all struggle through it with different experiences in different ways. There's concern about increased numbers. People were frustrations after so many months of a stringent lockdown, and also the economic crisis. Hopefully we can maintain our progress.Stay current with updates Sheryl S, and arrive with multiple back-up plans. Fingers crossed for Italy's vaccine RAF; really any effective vaccine. Many thanks to you NashMcGee. Could you perhaps contact your family by phone, even mobile service with WhatsApp for free?VagabondaEdited: 4:26 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"Yes Vagabonda, they have a phone but my Italian is not so good and they speak no english. We do okay in person and I can more easily communicate with them by writing with the aid of google translate and time to form my sentences. In case of emergency they have a kind neighbor who I can email but I hate to be intrusive.Raffaele, they live in the Trentino. A most beautiful area but very small and isolated. Fortunately their village has been spared much of the virus.As I said I am so thankful for the updates on this forum and as soon as travel is safe, probably after a vaccine is available, I hope to see them."
"The Italian Government is in process of trying to make uniform the differing ordinances which have very recently been enacted by several regions (e.g. Emilia-Romagna, Campania, Puglia, Sicilia) adding new restrictions for Italians returning from vacations in certain higher-risk for COVID-19 E.U. countries, and specifically SPAIN, MALTA, CROATIA and GREECE (all on Italy's ""B"" list together with other E.U./Schengen countries, plus the U.K.). Persons arriving from these four E.U. countries would be required to be tested within 48 hours of their arrival. The test could be administered at the airport of arrival. COVID-19 testing, rather than a 14-day quarantine, is obviously deemed less onerous. We await to read the definitive test of this amendment to the Italian Entry Regulations.There is talk that CROATIA may join fellow E.U. members BULGARIA and ROMANIA in treatment by Italian authorities: a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for anybody arriving from these countries. A final decision on CROATIA is expected shortly. These E.U. countries are on Italy's official ""C"" list. All other E.U./Schengen countries, plus the U.K., are on Italy's ""B"" list, currently not subject to any quarantine requirement, and whose residents are allowed entry into Italy for any lawful reason.Italy's ""black list"" welcomes a new addition: COLOMBIA. No one having stayed in this country in the previous 14 days will be allowed entry into Italy, with only very narrow exceptions. Other ""Black list"" nations currently are: Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bosnia Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Kosovo, Kuwait, North Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Oman, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, Serbia. ""Black list"" countries are on Italy's official ""F"" listItaly's ""white list"" countries are: Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay. (Notice that Uruguay is the sole country in Latin America). Residents of these countries (irrespective of citizenship) are allowed entry into Italy for any lawful reason, BUT are required to self-isolate for 14 days. ""White list"" countries comprise Italy's official ""D"" list.MOST COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE E.U./SCHENGEN ARE ON ITALY'S official ""E list"". This includes the UNITED STATES. Residents of these countries are not allowed to enter Italy, except in very narrow circumstances, OR unless holding an E.U./Schengen/U.K. passport (but with a 14-day quarantine requirement).If you've been paying attention, you may ask the question: who is on Italy's official ""A"" list?SAN MARINO and VATICAN CITY. These countries are in a ""special"" category insofar as they are given identical treatment as the countries on Italy's official ""B"" list, except that no auto-declaration is required when entering Italy from these two mini-states. Thankfully!The foregoing information is believed to be accurate as of today, but may change at any time.https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…Edited: 5:10 pm, August 12, 2020 "

"It's interesting to watch government scramble to uniform ordinances when regions and even autonomous regions pioneered ordinances. A bit late...If Italy is serious about keeping down cases, quarantine everyone on arriving flights. We didn't endure months of lockdown for tourism to spike our numbers. Tourism monies in the end might become very costly with another lockdown, and in the end negatively impact our economy.Vagabonda"
"Hi NashMcGeem,Your family is in a good location, and you are in a good position to email, and at times hear their voices by phone, and also knowing that there's a friend who could intercede.Best to you!Vagabonda"
"Vagabonda, I would be more comfortable if in Canada AND Italy, arrivals had to have a negative covid19 test, taken within the past 72 hours. Some countries have adopted this approach....why haven’t we?"
"#1657Italy is discussing this approach right now (requiring testing), at least with respect to countries deemed to be ""higher risk"", such as Spain, Malta, Greece and Croatia (and perhaps yet more in the near future). See posting #1653. Cannot speak to Canada.Requiring a quarantine for all arrivals (as contrasted to testing, which is far from 100% accurate) would be a much more rigorous approach, but it would essentially transform all ""List B"" countries (E.U./Schengen/U.K.) into ""List C"" (Bulgaria/Romania) and ""List D"" (white list) countries. It would largely shut down tourist entries as a practical matter. The Italian Government appears to be very hesitant to go this far (and there are reciprocity considerations as well), at least for the moment. If the numbers continue to increase, and continue to be heavily attributable to persons arriving from other countries, I expect the pressure to increase considerably to require either testing or a selective quarantine. ""List B"" may become shorter and ""List C"" may increase."
"UPDATE TO POSTINGS #1653 & 1658We now have the final text of the new Government Decree. In summary:1. COLOMBIA has been added to Italy's Official ""F"" list of blacklisted countries. With extremely limited exceptions, no one will be allowed entry into Italy if arriving from any blacklisted country in the previous 14 days.2. Any persons (regardless of nationality) coming from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA or SPAIN (all E.U. countries on Italy's Official ""B"" list) will NOT be allowed entry into Italy UNLESS they satisfy one of the following alternative requirements:(i) Demonstrate a negative COVID-19 test conducted in the previous 72 hours; or(ii) Undertake a COVID-19 ""quick results"" test at the airport or port of entry or other border crossing, which results negative, or if not possible, undertake such a test at the local health authority within 48 hours of arrival (during which time they must self-quarantine while waiting for the results).3. All such persons (regardless of nationality) must communicate with the local health authority to enable monitoring and tracing.4. The foregoing takes effect as of August 13, 2020 on Italy's entire territory.https:/…https:/…SICILY has gone one step further: it requires all Sicilian RESIDENTS (regardless of nationality) to SELF-QUARANTINE for 14 days upon entering Sicily from Greece, Malta or Spain (but not Croatia). At the conclusion of the self-quarantine, they must take a COVID-19 test. This does NOT apply to non-residents of Sicily, such as tourists. All others entering Sicily from Greece, Malta or Spain (i.e. non-residents of Sicily) must register on the website www.siciliasicura.com for purposes of monitoring and tracing. The foregoing takes effect as of August 14, 2020.https:/…ordinanza3212092020.pdf"
"Follow-up to posting #1659The newly promulgated Italian National ordinance requiring persons arriving in Italy from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA and SPAIN is reportedly creating much anxiety, confusion and even chaos on the part of affected travelers, as this article notes:https:/…The articles reports, with a pinch of irony, that the Region of Emilia-Romagna has reportedly decided that they will NOT require persons arriving from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA or SPAIN to SELF-ISOLATE while they wait for the results of the COVID-19 test to be administered locally in that region (for those who have not already tested negative in the 72 hours prior to arrival). This puts Emilia-Romagna as the first Italian region which essentially is not going to enforce the self-quarantine requirement of the national government. Emilia-Romagna bases its decision, reportedly, on a ""different interpretation"" of the ordinance!!! Maybe regional authorities there plan to have quick COVID-19 tests administered at Bologna Airport in a matter of a few days, for those persons arriving from the affected countries."

"Be sure to have travel insurance in place for your trip to Italy. Check your policy carefully. The BIG print give them, the small print taketh away! Also check with your airline carrier re re-booking. There may be penalties. If you have insurance you should be okay, particularly if it is “for any reason,” which costs more, but covers when you cancel. Since it is a pandemic yours may cover cancellation. Do check with the countries you’ll be visiting and what their current regs are re CV19 / quarantines as you get closer. I was there last October in Venezia / Florence / etc. I actually “had” the virus. Got it in Veneto. I still went around the cities as if it were nothing, not knowing it was more serious as a virus.

"#1671. I could not agree more. But the problem is actually even broader: tourists are bringing back COVID-19 to their countries of residence, whether Italy or many other countries in the world (and there is even wholly domestic spread caused by internal travel). Which is the reason why Italy is not alone in beginning to tighten restrictions on incoming travel from abroad (and also on internal travel). Those additional restrictions, which are very probably justified and necessary based on the epidemiological patterns, also have the intended effect of discouraging travel to certain countries deemed at higher risk. We all need to see a much wider and more uniform application of the basic concept of demonstrating personal responsibility."

"BREAKING NEWS:The Italian National Government has decided to shut down, once again, all discos, dance halls and similar establishments where people congregate to dance.The Government also decided to make mandatory the wearing of face coverings in all outdoor environments where it is not possible to maintain the minimum social distance.The decision is binding on all areas of Italy, including the autonomous regions and provinces. It is not binding on San Marino or the Vatican. (I don't believe that there are any dance halls in Vatican City)."
"UPDATE TO #1677The newly enacted Government Decree requiring the wearing of face masks outdoors applies from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in all areas where large gatherings can occur. Evidently, the Decree is designed to primarily regulate evening entertainment and socialization venues. Nevertheless, I always recommend (and practice) the wearing of face coverings wherever social distancing is not possible, regardless of the time of day.The wearing of face masks INDOORS (in public places) is already the legal norm.The Decree closing dance halls is valid through September 7, but could be extended."

We're monitoring the situation daily. We were hoping to come over on the 4th September for a weeks cycling in Tuscany followed by a week relaxing in Positano.. We're going to hold off booking anything until a day or 2 before we are hoping to come.. Think today's daily new infection is up over 650 again. What's the general feeling in Italy? If the UK Government imposed a 14 day self isolation on return I wouldn't go.. If I was already there I'd book a flight home that day if they announced it.. Not ideal but desperate for a holiday and some much needed vitamin D.
"#1701There are 13 reporting days between now and September 1, during which the numbers will continue to change.On this thread, you will find my summary of each day's changes in several COVID-19 statistics. From a low of 159 new cases on August 2, Italy today reported 642 new cases, the highest daily count in nearly three months. While the number of daily new cases is still only about 10% of the all-time high registered on March 20, nevertheless there has been an uptick lately. Moreover, the number of new hospitalizations and ICU admissions has also begun to climb, slowly at the moment.I think you are doing absolutely the right thing to monitor the situation and not make up your mind until one or two days beforehand. You are also very prudent in closely monitoring your own government's quarantine requirements upon returning to the U.K. from abroad. As you know, these can change on a dime, and with less than 48 hours advance notice.NOTE: I don't mean to imply that the summary of statistics which I report daily on this thread are necessarily the best measurements to gage the progress of COVID-19 infections in Italy. Indeed, I draw my summary from official government websites, which contain many other statistics worth reviewing and considering. Readers are encouraged to access those (and other) official government sites for more complete statistics.Edited: 11:52 am, August 19, 2020 "
"""What's the general feeling in Italy?""As always with such things, it depends entirely on who you talk to but within my own circle of close friends, neighbours and their families the simple word is concerned, deeply. And that's a broad spectrum of people.Oh and as a Brit, I wouldn't trust the British govt in the slightest. We've seen what happened in Spain and France. If quarantine is going to be introduced, it's unlikely you'll have time to get home ....Edited: 11:58 am, August 19, 2020 "
"Iastraniera, Vagabonda, Raffaele, my heart is absolutely aching for all of you. For all of Italy. You had such joy post lockdown, with promising low numbers. Dammit why did this happen again, was it really so important to take a vacation and bring it back to the country? I know Italy will again bring the numbers back down, but I am full of sorrow for your return to restricted movement. I love you all."
"That's really kind of you. To be honest, it angers me when I think of all the sacrifices almost the entire country made to pull things around earlier in the year, and although respecting the govt's approach, some of us did feel that certain aspects of the re-opening in phase 2 and certainly phase 3 was too much, too fast. Also, something that is perhaps slightly unique to Italy is the way in which the generations live in close proximity to each other. So many people I know live three generations to a house, so say for example you have college-age kids hanging out in bars and clubs in close proximity not wearing masks, they run a real risk of bringing whatever they pick up home and infecting older, more vulnerable members of the family. This is something a lady I was talking to (in her mid-80s) said only today. She loves to see the family every Saturday for lunch but she wonders where the grandchildren have been. It's a real cause for concern.Then we have the tourists - mainly Italians but foreigners too - who behave as though the pandemic has never happened. I've given up going for coffee in the morning as their idea of social distancing is very much different to my own. And masks? What are they? It's good to see them here spending money, sure, local businesses need them. But ...."
Thank you Diamond. Very kind of youWe know one day it will be all over. We are waiting for that day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49hocKslTX0
"Concerning news then it seems.Getting a bit worried about our holiday, meant to be flying out from UK a week tomorrow.Obviously the health of people is more important, I just hope we get enough time to react and change plans."
"Yes, it's very kind of you Diamondlover, and thank you!I completely agree with lastraniera about our stringent lockdown, and then the speedy reopening. It was shocking, just too much and too fast, and especially considering what we had enduring for months prior.It had nothing at all to do with what we needed to replenish ourselves, and it had everything to do with economics, and the arrival of the touristic season and revenues.Tourists who weren't wearing masks at home surely aren't wearing masks here. They have little regard for our regulations. But if there are changed requirements on arrival home, and a quarantine on arrival they will be outraged!!WHY? WHY did we sacrifice so much for so long to bring down our contagion only to open travel and contagion??How foolish!!How stupid!!How near-sighted!!What gain??We needed to get to a place where Italians replenished their sprints and souls to face what might come here later in autumn, but not open to travel.In the end we will pay dearly again, both economically but also emotionally with lockdown, loss of life, loss of freedoms, online instruction....And really this is not the optimal time to travel, and for anyone planning a holiday, expect quick changes and plan contingency back-ups for all eventualities.Vagabonda"
"You know really, what was the point for us to stay in months of lockdown and then open to travel, and have tourists arrive and spread contagion, or have Italians travel and return and spread contagion?The virus hasn't gone anywhere; it's here. Never left. Cases decreased because of social distancing. There's still no vaccination, and there's no cure even if we have learned a bit more on treatment.It wasn't brilliant to open to travel. It wasn't even economically sound in the end.Exactly when will this be viewed as a medical crisis first, and then an economic crisis? How much more lockdown to endure?How many more lost family members, friends, and colleagues?Fortunately our numbers have been lower than most in Europe, and we access and react quickly, but I can tell you that I never agreed with what Dario Franceschini did with opening tourism, and I stated it months ago on this forum.VagabondaEdited: 8:12 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Just to put matters in context, France and Spain today reported new cases which are nearly SIX TIMES HIGHER than Italy, while Germany had more than twice as many new cases. Of course, these statistics need to be read with care, since relative populations differ amongst the four countries, as do the number of swabs conducted. Still, what is similar is the fact that the new cases are the highest in three months.What I interpret is that people are just not consistently respecting social distancing and/or consistently wearing masks, and that some high-risk venues continue to remain open. Tourism and moving around only exacerbate the situation.Let's see where we are in a week's time, or by the beginning of September. This may influence what happens with the resumption of schools. In the US, for example, the reopening of schools and of colleges/universities this month has not gone well at all."
"So other countries are higher. Does that change anything?That doesn't reflect feeling, or pain, or loss here.There's a deficit in report statistics and putting matters in context, because there's no heart in that. There's no feel for the high school teacher who sat at a computer the entire day doing instruction online for months without ever leaving her home.There's no feel for daughters stopped from attending their mother's funeral.We were the highest in Europe, and we endured a stringent lockdown, and we worked and really sacrificed to get our numbers down.Staistics are cold.VagabondaEdited: 9:01 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"I am very sorry for what is occurring with the resumption of schools in the US.I spoke with a friend in the US just yesterday, and her entire university in-person program including foreign studies/travel has been cancelled, and studies will be conducted online.

"“It wasn't brilliant to open to travel. It wasn't even economically sound in the end.”Referring to travel within Italy, the re-opening of hotels, even some restaurants - I wonder this too. I felt at the time that it was done to create a semblance of “la vita normale” that would perhaps reassure local people who were in desperate need of a morale booster after months of being stuck inside. And I believe it worked at first. I shall never forget the day our village bar re-opened, it really did feel like the beginning of the end, that we had turned a corner, despite the reduction in tables and people turning up in face masks. At the time, newly released, everyone was being so, so sensible, some still extremely cautious, it would be a good few weeks before we went back as we didn’t feel ready but it was nonetheless really good to see it open and people sitting outside happily chatting.As for the owners of small hotels or agriturismi, being told they could re-open if they wanted to (subject to respecting strict hygiene protocols) must have come as such a relief for I’m sure many feared the entire summer would be written-off and with it, possibly, their livelihoods too. But without the non-European market that far too many, at least near me, rely on, I wondered why some bothered to re-open for any other reason besides psychological. I hate myself for writing this but then and now I couldn’t help thinking that some were in denial, merely postponing the inevitable demise of their business in a market saturated with similar commercial activities.Yet it’s clear some of the agri in this area are doing surprisingly well, relatively speaking, especially if they have the mechanisms in place to capture the domestic market. Several times in recent weeks both on the Tuscany board and privately I’ve suggested properties to people only for them to write back and say the place is full until late September!Some owners I know are working their backsides off to source business from just about anywhere they can, irrespective of what's required or the margins. But others? Sadly, I strongly suspect they are open (“business as usual”) purely for the sake of appearances (“we are still here”), perhaps to convince themselves and their clients that the pandemic hasn’t had any impact on tourism in Tuscany. It has, obviously, you see that on every village street in this area as Italian tourists outnumber other European visitors by perhaps as much as 9 to 1 some days, whilst total numbers are, I would guess, barely 50% of what we normally see in August. And although local businesses must be extremely grateful for the increase in domestic tourists, as I’m sure everyone on this board knows, few Italians spend in the same way their north American, Chinese, Australian counterparts do. I look back on all the talk during the darkest days of the lock-down in Italy and remember vividly how few truly imagined there would be a summer vacation season even remotely similar to what we’ve seen in the past. How much air time and column inches were dedicated to “will Italians be able to return to the beach this summer?” If you had told me then that they would be back in great numbers crowding onto the sand almost as they did before, I simply wouldn’t have believed it. At the time, I didn’t think anyone was ready for that, that few people would be prepared to take such risks. Judging by the photograph accompanying this article this morning, clearly, I was wrong. We’ll just have to see what happens next. I am definitely stocking up on flour ….https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/1…"
"To me what is most devastating, disheartening and despairing is to witness that the population at large starts to ""wake up"" to the continuing dangers of COVID-19 only when the casualties start to increase significantly, and are sufficiently covered by the media. Until then, far too many people resume their old habits which are incompatible with a pandemic situation which is still far from over.Opening up to tourism was, in my opinion, largely an experiment, to see whether this important part of the national economy could be partially reactivated with relative safety, but the results depended largely on everyone taking all necessary precautions and not engaging in risky behavior. This simply did not occur with enough people. It does not take many offenders to re-ignite the pandemic wildfire. So too the reopening of schools and universities in the United States. In the latter case, battalions of immature 18-20 year olds partying off campus without masks demonstrated that there are still too many students who lack the sensibility and maturity to act appropriately in this new world of COVID-19. So the universities are shutting down once again. (There are also plenty of irresponsible mature adults who are contributing to the problem, and whom I find to be even more culpable because age has not given them much wisdom).Only so much blame rests with governments and local officials. Without the full cooperation of the population, the pandemic will simply continue to spread, at different rates depending on the circumstances, and even a vaccine, once widely administered, probably won't give more than 50-75% temporary immunity, which means that the precautions will need to persist for years to come.The vast majority of persons are acting responsibly, but they are at the mercy of a relatively small minority who either don't care or are too immature to understand."

"UPDATED CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS FOR ITALY as of August 20, 17:10 Italy time:https:/…salute.gov.it/portale/…(click on ""ultimo aggiornamento sulla situazione in Italia"")SUMMARY: Today there was a significant jump in the number of new cases, but also more tests. NEW cases increased by 845 in the past 24 hours (the highest since May 16), compared to an increase of 642 yesterday and 403 the day before. Over the past 20 days, new cases have ranged from a low of 159 (August 2) to a high of 845 (today). This is more than a five-fold increase from the low. The average daily increase in new cases in the past 7 days is 556. The highest daily increase recorded to date (6557) occurred on March 21 (so today's increase is 12.89% of that on the worst day).The number of new cases each day depends in part on the number of tests performed, which does vary considerably. The ratio today of new cases to tests performed was 1.09%. This ratio is especially significant in evaluating the progress of the pandemic, and will be reported daily henceforth.New cases = the increase in total cases. Total cases as officially reported are now 256118. Total cases include deaths and ""cured"" persons.New cases are spread out amongst many regions, ranging from high of 159 in Veneto, 154 in Lombardia, and 115 in Lazio, to 1 in Valle d'Aosta. 9 regions reported 30 or more new cases. Not a single region reported zero new cases. Many of the new cases are reportedly attributable to Italians returning from European and domestic vacations (including notably from Sardegna), and especially from certain countries now under observation by Italian health authorities. Some regions have implemented additional safeguards and restrictions to combat this phenomenon.The Italian National Government has also added new COVID-19 testing requirements for all persons arriving from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA and SPAIN, as described in the previous postings.The average age of new cases has dropped significantly to 35.Deaths increased by 6 in the past 24 hours, compared to 7 in the previous three days. Total deaths as officially reported are 35418.The national death rate as officially reported is now 13.83% (down from a high of 14.53% on June 20).The number of hospitalized, non-ICU, patients increased by 17 to 883, higher than the low of 705 on August 1, and the highest since July 8. The highest hospitalization count (29010) occurred on April 4. That means that today's count is 3.04% of the high. ICU patients increased by 2 to 68 (highest since July 12), which represents 1.66% of those at the beginning of April, when the number of ICU cases reached its peak (4068). The lowest ICU count was 38 on July 29.NOTE: When reporting statistics concerning deaths and hospitalizations, it becomes all too easy to forget that the ""numbers"" represent a great deal of human anguish and suffering. There are real persons and families behind these numbers, and we do not forget that fact as we review the daily reports. Moreover, as this thread and this forum concern Italy, no attempt is made to place the ""Italian"" COVID-19 numbers in context with other countries, nor to make comparisons."
"Thanks for the daily updates. Out of curiosity, do you have the numbers of tests being taken daily?I can see the case numbers have gone up a lot, but like many other European countries, the testing numbers have gone up quite considerably too, along with testing at airports for people arriving from certain areas and high risk countries, which will of course add additional cases.Any information would be appreciated."
"Afternoon,Can you confirm the current daily testing numbers in Italy?I appreciate the case numbers have gone up a lot over the last few days, but I am sure, like many other European countries, testing capacity has increased also. The percentage of cases from number of tests is the main thing I am looking at. Also more testing at airports and from certain regions/Countries, will only also add to more cases.Any information would be much appreciated."
"WelshCouple87:The number of COVID tests can be found in the daily official updates on this site:salute.gov.it/portale/…(click on ""ultimo aggiornamento sulla situazione in Italia"")Today, there were 77442 tests performed (Incremento tamponi), and 845 new cases (Incremento casi totali rispetto al giorno precedente), so the ratio of new cases to tests is 1.09%. The ratio has been much, much higher in many states of the US.Going forward, I will be reporting this percentage in my daily updates, because the ratio is very important to gage the progress or regression of the virus."
"You can also see a breakdown, region per region of Italy, of the ratio of daily new cases to number of tests here:https:/…Scroll down to ""rapporto tra nuovi contagi e persone testate per regione""As of yesterday, Sardegna has the highest ratio (3.94%) while the Province of Trento the lowest (0.23%)."

I've been studying France and Italy's figure's over the last few weeks as I was hoping to go to France then Italy on holiday next month. We decided to cancel France just before the UK Government imposed the 14 day qurenteine on return rule . We then turned our attention to Italy as the figures were low. Its looking ever so likely that Italy amongst other countries is unfortunately going the same way. I'm fully expecting Italy to join the list of countries us Brits will have to isolate on return. We've decided to forget about overseas travel this year.. The constant worry about isolation has made up my mind..To say we're disappointed is an understatement.
"Regarding #1729, we are seeing the same thing in the US. The first peak of cases back in April was centered on New York City and the Northeastern US, which is more densely populated than the rest of the country. The mortality rates back then were higher than the rates we are seeing now. This summer, the peaks have mostly been in southern states, and most of the people getting sick have been younger. It does appear that the virus is no longer as virulent as it was in the spring. Most cases are mild or asymptomatic. Though our cases have gone way up this summer, deaths from the disease have remained relatively flat. This is good news. And it is notable that there has not been a new peak in NYC or the other northeastern states. Perhaps enough people are immune there now that the virus can no longer gain a foothold. May it be so in Italy, too. You folks have suffered enough!"
"Marco Carrara is a 43 YO man living near Bergamo with his family. He lost his father by the virus and recovered himself after 115 days and 28 positive swab tests, until the last two negatives.https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/lomb…Google TranslatedCoronavirus, 43 ""free"" after 115 days of hospitalization and 28 swabsMarco Carrara returned home to Albino, in the province of Bergamo, and was able to hug his family againMarco Carrara, the 43-year-old who tested positive for coronavirus for months, returned home to Albino, in the province of Bergamo. After 28 swabs, the green light finally arrived. The man was first hospitalized 115 days, then, clinically cured but still positive for the swab, he was placed in quarantine. Only now has he been able to embrace the family again.Admitted on March 31 - Marco Carrara was admitted to the Giovanni XXIII hospital on March 31, shortly after the death of his father from coronavirus. He spent a month and a half in the hospital while another spent at the San Francesco clinic. There his condition worsened and he returned to John XXIII. On 8 June rehabilitation began at the Piccinelli d Scanzorosciate Foundation, also in the province of Bergamo.On July 24, tampons still positive - On July 24 he was discharged but, as he himself said, he could not go home ""because the tampons were still positive"". So he quarantined himself in his father's apartment: no contact with his wife and two children who he was able to embrace again only now, while the bells of the village were ringing for his final recovery.The desire now? ""Stay at home"" - During these months, in response to an email that he had sent him, Prime Minister Conte ""through his secretary offered me condolences for the death of my father and best wishes to me"". Then there was a phone call from the Pope's Vicar General, Angelo Comastri, and the Bishop of Bergamo Francesco Beschi. Now ""I would like to go to the cemetery to visit my parents, then stay home for a few days with my children and my wife,"" he told L'Eco di Bergamo."
"UPDATED CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS FOR ITALY as of August 21, 17:10 Italy time:https:/…salute.gov.it/portale/…(click on ""ultimo aggiornamento sulla situazione in Italia"")SUMMARY: Today there was yet another noteworthy jump in the number of new cases, yet fewer tests from yesterday. The pandemic numbers are increasing moderately notwithstanding the periodic increase and decrease in the number of tests.NEW cases increased by 947 in the past 24 hours (the highest since May 14), compared to an increase of 845 yesterday, 642 on Wednesday, 403 on Tuesday and 320 on Monday. Over the past 20 days, new cases have ranged from a low of 159 (August 2) to a high of 947 (today). This is a six-fold increase from the low. The average daily increase in new cases in the past 7 days is 609. The highest daily increase recorded to date (6557) occurred on March 21 (so today's increase is 14.44% of that on the worst day).The number of new cases each day depends in part on the number of tests performed, which does vary considerably. The ratio today of new cases to tests performed was 1.32%. The ratio of the previous five days was 1.30%, 1.04%, 0.75%, 0.90% and 1.09% yesterday. This ratio is especially significant in evaluating the progress of the pandemic, and will be reported daily henceforth.New cases = the increase in total cases. Total cases as officially reported are now 257065. New cases include deaths and ""cured"" persons.New cases are spread out amongst many regions, ranging from a high of 174 in Lombardia, 137 in Lazio and 116 in Veneto, to 0 in Valle d'Aosta and Basilicana. 11 regions reported 30 or more new cases. Many of the new cases are reportedly attributable to Italians returning from European and domestic vacations (including notably from Sardegna), and especially from certain countries now under observation by Italian health authorities. Some regions have implemented additional safeguards and restrictions to combat this phenomenon.The Italian National Government has also added new COVID-19 testing requirements for all persons arriving from CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA and SPAIN, as described in the previous postings.The average age of new cases has dropped significantly to 35.Deaths increased by 9 in the past 24 hours, compared to 6 in the previous three days. Total deaths as officially reported are 35427.The national death rate as officially reported is now 13.78% (down from a high of 14.53% on June 20).The number of hospitalized, non-ICU, patients increased by 36 to 919, higher than the low of 705 on August 1, and the highest since July 7. Hospitalizations have increased by 30% in three weeks. The highest hospitalization count (29010) occurred on April 4. That means that today's count is 3.17% of the high. ICU patients increased by 1 to 69 (highest since July 8), which represents 1.70% of those at the beginning of April, when the number of ICU cases reached its peak (4068). The lowest ICU count was 38 on July 29.NOTE: When reporting statistics concerning deaths and hospitalizations, it becomes all too easy to forget that the ""numbers"" represent a great deal of human anguish and suffering. There are real persons and families behind these numbers, and we do not forget that fact as we review the daily reports. Moreover, as this thread and this forum concern Italy, no attempt is made to place the ""Italian"" COVID-19 numbers in context with other countries, nor to make comparisons."
The situation is getting worse.Italian tourists returning from abroad are queueing at the Malpensa airport to be swab tested on arrivalhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8meLYDHy6c
Well that looks like fun!!! I notice that no one wears the cloth masks....is that true for people on streets? I know most airlines required non cloth masks so maybe why at airport but wondering. Here in US most people are wearing cloth and of varying quality and of course how they are worn varies greatly. I am beginning to think US is kidding themselves with these cloth masks?
"Raffaele if you read some of the comments, therein lies a big part of the problem. Conspiracy theorists abound...”it’s a hoax virus”, “they just want your DNA on file” etc. God forgive those fools (because I don’t)..Gene, cloth masks are as good as the blue medical masks, but N95’s are superior to all."
"How can normal people, with some insight in medicine, don't become suspicious about governmental frenzy fighting against kind of corona virus called now covid, canceling flights and doing other silly and ilogical things, because it is not dangerous for absolute majority of people? And this do governments who usually care only about their own income. Every thinking person in such situation can become suspicious about conspiracy...Edited: 5:50 pm, August 21, 2020 "
"WLM, since governments care only about income, what advantage do you think Italy's government saw in closing everything down, educing it's revenue because economic activity slowed down to almost nothing?I would very much like to see some logic in any answer, rather than just recycled conspiracy theories passed around by nutjobs on the web."
"Can i go to italy though slovenian border when i was 5 days in croatia? Is it any noted that i was in croatia? I am not croatian, but Polish citizen"
"If it's within the last 14 days, you should note it yourself that you were in Croatia. People have to be honest on the forms, when they're asked where they've been for the previous 14 days. This is an important way to stop the spread of Covid...."
"On the self-declaration form, you are required to list all countries through which you stayed or transited in the previous 14 days.https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…See #4 and #5E.You may enter Italy but will be required to take a COVID-19 test, because you stayed in or transited thru Croatia in the 14 days prior to entering Italy.I have not researched the entry requirements for Slovenia or Croatia."
"RojBlake, I speak about personal income of government members, about which they care. Not their hypocritical political speach about common good as they are supposed to do as rulers of countries. No fighting against corona makes their own income lower. And highly likely they can be involved in world wide conspiracy. I want to see logic in governmental action in all this flight cancellation etc. I don't see. They only worsens traveler situation abroad. They fight against fly as against elephants."
But where to take that test and who is paying for it?
"Also as i understand i need to have this with myself in case someone will ask for it for in public transport,right?"
@1743 if you are willing to travel during a worldwide pandemic especially between countries where numbers are rising and governments are changing rules minute to minute I would suggest you be prepared to pay for the test yourself in case that is required.
"#1743The test is being administered at airports and ports of entry (not necessarily all of them). At the moment, I believe that there is no charge, but this might change in the future, at least for non-Italian residents. If not available at the port or airport of entry, the tests are administered in regional and provincial capitals, and in other towns, at designated locations announced by the local health boards (ASL).For foreign tourists, taking the test at the airport or port of entry is strongly encouraged, or better yet having the test performed in the 72 hours prior to entering Italy.It's not a bad idea to carry a copy of the test results with you, in case you plan to board a ferry or plane. I don't think the results would be requested in order to board a city bus or metro line, or a domestic train or regional bus, however!"
Is it possible to leave Italy (flight back to US) before the 14 day quarantine is over? Will I be stopped or sent back into quarantine or made to book a laater return?
"I believe that the common sense answer may be NO, because you are not allowed to leave your residence during the quarantine period (you cannot help being in contact with people, even if a friend drives you to the airport). Unless you are a passenger in TRANSIT or you entered Italy for reasons of work or absolute urgency, you would not have voluntarily entered Italy in the first place knowing of the 14-day quarantine requirement (or you impliedly would have consented to the quarantine by virtue of entering Italy, assuming you had the right to enter the country in the first place).NEVERTHELESS, if you have an urgent or compelling reason to return to the US prior to the conclusion of the 14-day quarantine, you should check with the local health board (ASL) for guidance. If you are already under surveillance for 14 days, you are probably being contacted daily by telephone, so you can ask this question directly to the public health representative contacting you. I imagine that it may be possible to be given a dispensation to travel back to your permanent home abroad (provided that you do not have any COVID-19 symptoms).https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…(See Article 6 in particular)"

"UPDATE TO #1758The number of swabs performed today has been updated, so I am now able to report today's RATIO of new cases to tests performed: 1.80%, a big jump from yesterday (1.38%). The Ratios for the past several days are: 1.30%, 1.04%, 0.75%, 0.90%, 1.09%, 1.32%, 1.38% and 1.80% (today).The Ratio of new cases to tests performed is a much more telling indicator than mere new cases alone. The Ratio's significant increase today is further evidence that the COVID-19 contagion is spreading in Italy (although it is still much lower than in March and April)."

The volunteers are in any case divided into two large groups according to age: the first includes people between 18 and 55 years, the second between 65 and 85. Many volunteers are doctors. Each group will be divided into three subgroups of 15 people, each of whom will be given a different dose of vaccine. During 'phase 1' each volunteer will be injected with a dose of vaccine.

"#1783While I believe you are right in the end, stating the coronavirus is not the worst of all evils, I am afraid your premise is questionable.Respectfully, I don't agree, for example, the Italian Government adopted the wrong decisions.Mr. Conte (Italian PM) has been strongly criticized for having imposed the lockdown on all Nation at the beginning of March. Italy has been the first among Western countries to adopt such a stringent order. People from all over the World, Italians included, at first believed it was a too strong measure and looked at Sweden, for example, not to say UK or US.Well, with hindsight and the right foresight, not completely predictable at that time, I am happy he did what he did...We lost some money. Very true. But many families can still hug their dearest even if, sadly, not all of them.Concluding, famine is a plague fo a large part of the World. Lockdown in western countries might have worsened it. I am so sorry for the many dying for hunger but as selfish as it might seem, I don't believe avoiding lockdown could have been a solution to lighten famine."

"FOLLOWUP TO POSTING #1805First came CROATIA, GREECE, MALTA and SPAINThen came FRANCE (not yet official)Now comes the ENTIRE EUROPEAN UNION (maybe):Italian Vice Minister for Public Health Sandra Zampa stated in an interview that the Italian Government is carrying on discussions with its European counterparts to EXTEND the COVID-19 testing requirements for ALL CROSS BORDER CROSSINGS within the E.U., not merely those between Italy and the aforementioned countries. This would be a stopgap measure while waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine to be widely administered.If this comes to pass, this would require a significant effort to augment the testing capabilities at frontier crossings (highways, ports and airports) for most of the European Continent, a very ambitious goal indeed.Theoretically, it could even be further extended to certain countries outside of the E.U., such as those on Italy's official ""D List"" (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and a few others), although this seems quite a stretch at this juncture. More likely (it seems to be) arrivals from these countries (and indeed other extra-E.U. countries) would be required to have proof of COVID-19 vaccination (meaning not until next year). (In the meantime, entries from ""D List"" countries ARE allowed, but subject to a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine, making travel for tourism quite unlikely.)https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_agosto_3…https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_agosto_3…ONCE AGAIN, NOTHING OFFICIAL YET, but we now see the direction Italy is pursuing to ensure that its borders with other E.U. countries can continue to remain open, with a free flow of persons in both directions."
"Thanks for your report GAC!A bit too little too late really.We went from stringent lockdown to open travel.What genius couldn't predict the outcome?So all our months of sacrifice in lockdown; a really horrible and stringent lockdown like most globally have not sustained, to lower cases and save lives in the end were a token for some small monies gained from tourism that in the end will cause more deaths, more losses economically, more strain on our medical, and more emotional hardship for us all.The only good thing I can say is that Italy at least moves quickly to shut it all down again.But perhaps more will resist now.Some freedom during summer gave the population a sense of normalcy in summer, and a vent after the last lockdown, but at what cost?VagabondA"

This same rule applies to entries from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and six other countries.In my posting above, I noted parenthetically that all arrivals from ""D List"" countries must self-quarantine for 14 days.Having to self-quarantine for 14 days severely reduces travel for tourism, as the vast majority of ""tourists"" can't afford (and don't want) to quarantine for this period of time, unless they are retired or financially independent.You will find the complete list of countries which comprise Italy's lists ""A"" through ""F"" at the end of this document:https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…(see ""Annex 20"")Edited: 10:06 pm, August 30, 2020 "
GAC:worldtraveller0202 is entering Italy from Poland (not Canada) after a 14 day stay there. You had answered a prior question a few pages back in this thread. worldtraveller0202:I would make sure to have ample documentation indicating that you were in Poland for those 14 days in case you are asked to prove it

GAC:Would worldtraveller0202 receive an exit stamp from Poland? Poland and Italy are both in the Schengen Area so this leg of the trip is not exiting the Schengen zone.
"Probably not (which is why I put it in parenthesis). A hotel or credit card receipt might suffice in place of an exit stamp, if this were even required upon entry into Italy to demonstrate the length of stay in Poland.If the traveler is really concerned about this technicality, he should query the Italian Consulate in Canada prior to departure for Poland.Edited: 12:35 am, yesterday "
"Raffaele R, of course, I accept your freedom to believe according to your understanding.)"
Thank you both! Do you think if I divided my time between Poland and Germany for the 14 days it would be the same thing or better to stick to one country?
"But in fact, why to publish so massive data amount, more appropriate to medical journals, in travel forum? It looks as some kind of advertising."
"WLM:So in other words, what you are saying is that you think the snozzberries taste like snozzberries?"
"WLMIf you read the thread name, you get the answer.Fortunately, Tripadvisor is very sensitive on the matter and gave us permission to use its platform to discuss ""Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Italy""; ""Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Spain"" and many, many others. If you don't like what to read, nobody is imposing you.Sorry Diamond. Last time I reply to WLM. I promise"

"The Italian Consulate doesn't want to give me any straight answers... I feel like they don't really know LOL I've asked them twice and they just talk in circles so I am still not clear. For Canadians, we do not need to quarantine in either Poland OR Germany and my husband is a Polish citizen so I am hoping when we get to Italy with both EU Passports we should be good to go. I saw on another forum today that someone got on a bus in Munich going into Italy and no one asked her any questions or even wanted to see her passport."
To GAC And Rafaelle. Thank you. I have been following your posts throughout this whole situation. Our family are hoping to re-visit your beautiful country in the near future.God bless you both

worldtraveler0202: if you are able to understand (since it’s Italian only) and complete this form https://infocovid.viaggiaresicuri.it/ it might help you. It helped me confirm that I cannot go to Italy after being in an EU country for 14+ days due to my USA residency.
"#1836I compiled the questionnaire as though I were an EU National, departing from Canada, staying 14 days in Poland (or Germany), then going to Italy. I found the response surprising: entry is allowed (by virtue of both nationality and residency), BUT always subject to a 14-day period of self-isolation IN ITALY itself. In other words, the 14 days spent in Poland or Germany (or both) DID NOT ""purge"" the fact that I was coming from Canada, which is on Italy's ""D"" list. I say that I was surprised because I had assumed that, by staying outside of Canada for 14 days and in an EU country (apart from Croatia, Greece, Malta, Spain, Bulgaria or Romania), there would be no need for an additional 14 days of self-quarantine in Italy. But apparently NOT SO, perhaps because while in that other EU country, I might be ""in contact"" with other persons from outside the EU, and consequently still considered ""at risk"" of contagion. I can now see the logic of that rationale.The result was the same even if I were NOT an EU National, but still departing from Canada.However, if I were departing from the USA, I could NOT enter Italy as a US Citizen UNLESS I also had EU Nationality (or qualified for one of the other extremely narrow exceptions).Consequently I now see that my posting #1835 above is incorrect! (and I will delete it, as the previous postings which express the same opinion).Edited: 8:32 pm, yesterday "
Thanks for all of your help! I am part of another travel forum and everyone is saying that it depends on the border guard and also people have been let in without any issue. I have an Italian passport so I am going to get a test in Poland and then pray a little prayer that they let me in lol. Worst case scenario I will just go to another country lol.
"#1838 worldtraveller 0202:Everything you say is consistent with my experience dealing with Italian border agents. The ""Law"" is one matter, and what actually happens can at times be different. Also, the ""Law"" is not always applied or even interpreted consistently. Even Dante recognized this 700 years ago. While we all want to always be ""in compliance"", we understand that in reality exceptions are made, provisions ignored, and sometimes entry documents (such as the ""self-declaration"" are not even collected, as others have reported on these threads. What is especially significant, in my opinion, is that you are doing everything reasonably possible to demonstrate that you pose no COVID-19 risk to Italy (spending 14 days and getting tested in Poland), or, put another way, no greater risk than a Polish resident entering Italy (without any self-isolation requirement). To me, this demonstrates that you are being conscientious and not simply ignoring the Regulations. Let us know what happens.DISCLAIMER: readers are asked NOT to interpret this posting as in any way encouraging persons to ignore or to find ""loopholes"" around, the Entry Regulations. I do find it interesting (to put it mildly) that not even the Italian Consulate in Toronto was prepared to give the OP a definitive interpretation to her question concerning the Entry Regulations (see #1832 above; maybe because they of all people know that the answer can depend on the circumstances at the moment of actual entry).Edited: 12:23 pm, today "
"Reading from previous posts, a question is raised: is it safe to travel during Covid19?Well. I believe I cannot answer myself. I do need to listen to different opinions, like the Scottish guy in the video is sharing with ushttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax8Gmx1QOGY"
