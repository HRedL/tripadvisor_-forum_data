"I see that the airport does not allow international flights coming in until April 12th, but I am pretty certain that will be extended. Does anyone have any updates? I have been looking at the website Curacao.com"

No updates as of our press conference this morning. However we as an island are in a stay at home lockdown until Monday.I would venture to say that the April 12th date will be (and should be) extended.
"It has been extended until April 27, 2020.I have read the document from the Government but can't upload from my cell phone."
Here is the link with the updated information on the Curacao Airport website https:/â€¦coronavirus-bulletin-11-11-april-2020
"Thank you. Our reservation is not until May, and I am still waiting to find some official information online so I can cancel our booking with AirBnB and get a refund. As much as I would hope to take the trip, I don't think it will be feasible to travel in May already. Before anyone comments about rescheduling, it is not an option for us we have a July and September trip booked as well (and there is no telling what will happen with these trips)."
"I can tell you if you are flying American airlines, keep checking.Friends that were visiting us in May (American airlines via Dulles and Charlotte airports) have had their flights cancelled.I have read the same for others flying American airlines as well"
"Yes, American Airlines cancelled my May 15 flight last night. On top of that they are putting a disclaimer of only being allowed to reschedule once without a fee and that we have to pay any difference in flight prices. I would reschedule for August for a trip, but with only once chance to reschedule combined with who knows how long it will take for everything to open up again, we don't want to rebook yet. Plus they are not allowing giving a refund option."
At this point AA has changed our direct flight from CLT to a connecting flight through MIA. We are scheduled for May 16th. I will keep an eye on the flights as well as any updates from Curacao.
