"I was at the beach at Calle 38 this morning.The barriers are gone, and the beach is open for public access. About 2 dozen people were spread along the beach, and two lifegueards were in the tower -- they confirmed that the beach has reopened.The width of the beach is about 10 to 15 metres and mostly clean. There was a strip of old sargassum (no fresh sargassum) along the waterline, and a crew was busy cleaning it up.The umbrella/beach chair mafia has not returned yet. Mahekal is closed for renovations until about August. The Oxxo store at the beach is still closed, but it might reopen soon."
Good news! One step at a time
Great news. And my friends in Tulum wrote to me that the beaches there are open.
"AWESOME! I have been following this before booking a vacation for early September! WOO HOO!!!Edited: 12:52 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"Keep in mind, if the number of covid-19 cases increases, we could return to Red, and beaches & restaurants might close again.Edited: 12:57 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Very interesting. We were at Playa Norte on Isla Mujeres today and the beach was definitely closed.Is it now a municipal decision or is Solidaridad just ignoring the state rules?
"Seems like a decision made locally, and it might not last.Media report...In Spanish: https://sipse.com/novedades/ciudadanos-ignor…Translated to English: https://translate.google.com/translate…"
Public beaches like Xcalacoco to the north are still closed...
Thank you for the info!!! Music to my ears!!!
Thanks for the info. We have a trip booked in 2 weeks wondering what is like with the whole covid situation. Do you know if the pyramids/ruins will/are open? We are staying at a resort in Playacar.
"Playa is still not completely back to normal, and I don't expect it to be any time soon.Almost all shops along 5th Ave are still closed, and the southern section of 5th is still closed for remodelling. Many restaurants are open but with health protocols in place.All archaeological sites are closed and not expected to open until August/September.The government of the state of Quintana Roo introduced an epidemiological risk colour code, or traffic light, system for declaring what is allowed to reopen. The situation is reassessed each week, and the colour for the upcoming week is announced on Thursdays.The state of Quintana Roo is currently Orange which means restrictions are eased for some services/activities. Supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants (for dining in), theme parks, cenotes, theatres, cinemas, commercial centres are allowed to open with health protocols in place. Hotels can open but with a maximum capacity of 30%.Bars, nightclubs, gyms, schools, parks, archaeological sites and beaches remain closed. There's a loophole with the beach situation because guests staying at beachside hotels are being allowed to go onto the beach (not sure if this is the case at all hotels in the state) and the colour code system is being ignored at some public beaches.For Playa updates, look at these threads...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15081…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15081…"
MisterB266 What does that mean exactly if it goes back to Red. Everything closes completely? Does that mean all hotels too and tourists are banned again?
"If we return to Red, only essential services/activities remain open -- supermarkets, pharmacies, convenience stores, hospitals, etc.Restaurants will probably close for dining-in, and will be open for take-out only (those that remain open). Services/activities that opened under Orange will close again: cinemas, theatres, theme parks, cenotes, diving, commercial centres. Beaches will probably close again. We could have strict curfews and police check-points and be allowed to leave our homes only for food.Some hotels will close and the ones that remain open are allowed a maximum capacity of 15%.Cancun airport never closed, and tourists were never banned, but it's not a good time to travel.It wasn't fun under the previous Red, and I don't want to have another one, so follow the health protocols.Since the easing of restrictions a few weeks ago, there has been an increase in the number of confirmed cases.Edited: 9:53 am, July 05, 2020 "
"And no cerveza under Red...!Edited: 10:23 am, July 05, 2020 "
"""It wasn't fun under the previous Red, and I don't want to have another one, so follow the health protocols"" - your are so right MisterB.... I would think nobody wants to go back to tightening restrictions, and we, as tourists, are waiting for that ""good"" moment when we can come back and support PDC economy /enjoying ourselves in the process, of course :) /. There is a lot of construction going on in our town as well and that one particular road work that I want to mention is the road leading to the border with USA. I was just thinking how busy and congested it would be if the traffic was allowed to flow freely at the border.... Since it's minimal, they can repair the road faster and with not a lot of disruption. Same goes for PDC, I guess. I'm happy that they can make it more attractive /especially 5th Av/ while not a lot of foot traffic happens. I hope when our time comes to visit this area again, It will be even more vibrant then our last visit in December. I'm looking forward to enjoying all the changes made during Covid times :)"
PLAYA NOWhttps:/…
"It looks like the beach might be closed again.At the Calle 38 beach this morning, I watched police put yellow tape across the access, and stop people from going onto the beach. There were already people on the beach, but I didn't hang around to see if the police were going to tell them to go home. I'll check again in the afternoon."
The beach all the way down to Juarez has been cleared.No beach access from beach clubs.
