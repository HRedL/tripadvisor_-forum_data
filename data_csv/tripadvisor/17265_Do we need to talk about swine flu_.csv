Vice President Biden more or less threw tourism overboard this morning on The Today Show telling people that he would avoid commercial flights or riding in subway cars “at this point” because swine flu virus can spread “in confined places.” Now what? Do we wait to make plans for trips? What are the rest of you doing? 
Our flight to Maui leaves Wednesday the 13th and we plan to be on it!!!
"Apparently he misspoke this morning and that's not what he meant.The White House quickly arranged for Biden to make this statement through a spokesperson.“On the Today Show this morning, the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: Keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick and keep your children home from school if they're sick.” "
"Swine Flu is a variation of Type A Influenza, which has been prevelent in our society for centuries. Yes, it can kill, especially the younger and older populations and those that already have a compromised immune system, but it's generally just a a royal pain in the you know what if you are unfortunate enough to contract the virus.Take the normal precautions (wash hands fequently; cover your cough; avoid close proximity to those that appear ill) and you should be fine."
"I am going to Maui May 9 come hell, high water, or swine flu! "
Those two milks at the Lahina safeway for $10 are looking really good right now-i'm many a travler is rethinking both Hawaii and the caribbean with this fiasco going on-noticed that mexico is shutting down all non essciantial services -does that mean if you do go will your resort will be open when you get there or will fav restraunt be closed?
I can't believe this thread is even posted on the Maui Forum. I definitely wouldn't make the trip to Mexico but posting this on the Maui forum is complete paranoia. I am not scheduled to go to Maui until October but if my flight left tomorrow then I would be on it. 
"I would not worry. Ever since air travel was started we all carry the risk if catching whatever our fellow passengers have brought onboard. This is the flu, the flu can kill to be sure but the risk is minimal. We can't just put our lives on hold because the media is hyping this as the most dangerous thing to come along since the dark ages. I flew on Monday and will do so again on Friday and have zero qualms about it."
"As a side note, anyone with non refundable tickets to Maui that decides not to go let me know, I will take your tickets (for free of course)."
"Yes, everyone please cancel your trips, esp. those in the next weeks, that way it will be less crowded when I am there. Don't buy into the mainstreet media fear tactics. Remember the media loves these stories as fear gets ratings.Just use common sense thats all and make sure you have enough money for a burial plot in the Valley Isle if things go downhill. This is just another stupid statement by Biden. See Below:""I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that’s a storybook, man.""---Joe Biden statement about US presidential candidate Barack Obama, January 2007. ""In Delaware, the largest growth of population is Indian Americans, moving from India. You cannot go to a 7/11 or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking.""---Joe Biden statement in conversation with American-Indian political activist in 2006."
"So far I have tried to ignore all the media hype and over-excitement about this H1N1 influenza virus. As of today 90 some people in the USA have been diagnosed with this and one has died (and this was a visitor from Mexico). And all this made headlines.However, the fact that 36,000 Americans die every year from ordinary influenza (for which there is a vaccine) and 200,000 are hospitalized doesn't even make the back page of the newspaper. Yes, this new strain does not have a vaccine yet, but there are effective anti-viral treatments. So IMHO to cancel trips to anywhere other than Mexico, at this time, does not make sense. There have been more dangerous infections that have been brought on airplanes in the past (e.g. drug resistant TB). And that has never stopped people from flying. "
I must watch the non-fear instilling cable news channel because I'm not seeing anything like media hype. I see constant reminders about not panicking. I see facts given out. I see updates from the CDC given out.Not hype.
"Yes, Biden really screwed up. The comentator (the guy who took Russert's place) was quick to put Biden's comments into perspective - he doesn't want everyone to shun Mexico, but to act generally. Still - he REALLY screwed up!I am sitting here watching a hearing of major California public health officials, care providers and a bunch of really naive legislators who turn their back on public health until some emergency arises. Now they all want face-time with TV cameras. Bottom line -- stay up to speed with what your local health departments are telling you. There will be alot of hype, grandstanding, etc. - but your local or state public health department should give you the straight scoop. Follow the same common sense general guidelines that you would use to avoid any kind of flu. Stay away from Mexico? Until they can identify a source or core group of infected folks and isolate them - I sure would. Given the massive erruption of drug violence - there are now TWO good reasons. "
Drval - we had issues in California with SARS earlier in the decade - quarentined airplanes and such. The number of people flying took a dip for a while. 
At the moment I am a bit grumpy regarding the flying pig stuff - DH boss just got back from his Spring vacation - guess where he went? Mexico!Of course the 'outbreak' was never mentioned while he was there and he heard nothing about it until he walked into work on Monday morning. It will be what it will be - think good thoughts - please
"One of the best things I've heard a public health official say is that the 'pan' in pandemic merely means 'widespread'. Flu can kill; mostly it doesn't kill otherwise healthy people. We don't know yet how/why Mexican citizens died of this new strain, or if flu caused all the deaths attributed to it in Mexico. That pattern of fatalities has not emerged anywhere else. "
"On a selfish note here...two beautiful cruise ships are docking in Santa Barbara this weekend being diverted from the Mexican ports they were headed for. We love our tourists here in SB, they spend $ and enjoy our beautiful city as well:-) We only get a couple of cruise ships a year, so this is a treat for us!Eat well, sleep well, wash your hands a bizillion times a day AND keep a happy attitude and this too will pass before we know it."
"I agree with above posters. I am an RN and I think folks (including the media) are panicking over this. Influenza kills hundreds of people every year (mostly very young or very old). Even though there is no vaccine for this flu yet, take precautions you would take during any flu season, like washing your hands and sneezing into your elbows. Use common sense. Any of you wishing to cancel your trip, please pm me with the details so I can fill in for you"
"I would, however, avoid Mexico at the present time. COme to think of it, I would avoid Mexico for the future, too, and for lots of reason besides the present flu situation."
"Believe me Trix, the news up here IS sensationalizing this whole ordeal. OH-MY-GOD!!! There is ONE unconfirmed case of Swine Flu reported in Portland!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"My daughter and I are headed for Maui May 9 mfor 10 days come hell or high water. With the drug wars in Mexico I thought going to Mexico wasn't such a good idea, but most high school kids here go there for Spring Break. My guess is that Mexico hushed this virus up so they wouldn't lose the Spring Break business. I went once to Cancun and wouldn't ever go back. There is no comparison to Hawaii. This is our third visit in three years! Oahu, first; Big Island, second; and, this year Maui. I am so excited! I'm glad lots of people like to go to Mexico, though, since that makes Hawaii less crowded."
Den - that's why I go with FOX. Fair and balanced. :)
"My husband and I changed our reservations from Cancun to Maui...this at least is a nice calm discussion about it on this forum, if you read some of the Cancun Swine Flu threads on there people are being really hateful and defensive if you cancel or switch to a new location...frankly we chose to do what the advisory asked to do and we are very excited about our first trip to Maui..staying at the Napili Kai Beach Resort May 21-28...rented a jeep...oh yeah..."
"I think it's an appropriate topic for TA. But, we need facts, not opinions, when it comes to health and safety.I travelled over the Pacific during the SARS epedemic in China. Passengers from Asian countries wore masks, but I didn't have the slightest clue as to what was going on. If guess the cable news shows weren't that interested in Asian problems back then.From a quick check, I think only one cruise ship was in Mexico 2 weeks ago, and it is now on its way back to Ensenada."
no. 
Honu - our T.V. stations had live feeds from the airports ... continuously broadcasting flights that were delayed from coming to the gate while they were checked by health officials. 
I've never relied on a politician to give good medical advice. I didn't think that most people would listen to a politician for any factual info or advice.

"Since we're getting slighlt off-topic. Trixxee: FOX News? Fair and balanced? You've got to be kidding! I'll just assume you're being funny. If not, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that I'd like to sell you."
"Yes Trixxee is being funny. Fox News is about as ""fair and balanced"" as Swine Flu is a pandemic.(Now I know strains of the flu are serious and certainly can kill some, but please. Driving your car from Point A to Point B tomorrow will be way much more dangerous.I now listen to NPR because they have all the answers. Now that was Caddy trying to be funny, just in case I catch the Swine flu and croak!Where did my Purell go? <Rubbing>"
It is getting hard to get news as it should be-- just the facts.However by far I prefer Fox News over Obama's Communist News Network.
"Ooooooh, ""Communist!"" What a big word for a big patriot! "
"Hey, Caddy - it is pandemic. Pandemic can be used to mean that the flu is showing up in alot of different places. Spreading around. It is not, however - epidemic. "
"BLBL, are you trying to teach me something? Well, I think you just got through, because I understand. Thanks.Now having six guys show up on a small beach in Maui in pink speedos is what I call an epidemic. We can all agree on that! LOL"
"By George, he's got it! That Caddy is some smart guy when he can translate epidemiology into ""speedo."" "
