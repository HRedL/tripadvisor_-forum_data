"Our top 3 list is:1 David Copperfield -about 3-4 years ago- Wanted him to make himself disappear! Unfortunately for us, that never happened. Neither did any good magic. We did get to watch videos on big screen of his past successes in magic though...whoo, hoo. The worst waste of time (on a show) we have spent, anywhere really, not just Vegas. 2 Blue Man Group-maybe 7-8 year ago- felt like we were at a bad high school assembly. Paid full price for the tickets as my husband really wanted to see this show (for years) so I surprised him. Boy was he surprised...not in a good way as it turns out! Total bummer for us.3 Penn & Teller -about 3-4 years ago- went the next night after Copperfield bombed. Attempted unsuccessfully to rectify our bad decision on DC. Another bad decision s it turned out. Kinda boring. At least they posed for pictures after the show! Afternoon magicians have proven way more entertaining for us then the big names.Oh well, cant win them all! We do have an unwritten rule at least....we get to talk smack about the person in the group who picked the bad show/shows! That is fun for years to come really!What show sucked for you???Edited: 5 years ago "
Mac King. Big Elvis.
This is easy. We will never forget this. It was a Broadway review at San Remo (now Hooters). Most High School productions had better talent and were more professionally produced. In addition the showroom was exactly what you would expect from San Remo.
"I saw Sin City Comedy for the second time a few years ago now, and it wasn't that good. The comedians were mediocre, and the burlesque dancing acts weren't good at all. The first time I saw sin city comedy, circa 10 years ago, it was great."
I'll probably be yelled at for this but I didn't enjoy LOVE when I went about 4 years ago with my boyfriend. I was actually bored. But I hear a lot of people love it. Different strokes for different folks.A lot of people don't enjoy Britney Spears and it actually appeared like a lot of people in the audience were bored. But I've been twice and had a ball.
Criss Angel - about 4 years agoLa Reve - Last year
"Penn and Teller for sure. Too much talking and many of the tricks were ""meh"". Felt myself nod-off for a split second."
"Criss Angel.......he did the same basic disappearing trick in various ways.....and that was kind of it. Not exciting in the least....yes I was warned ahead of time, but my daughter really wanted to see him because he was, you know, like so hawt lol."
Ka was very boring. I wanted to leave
"Years ago at the tropicana folies bershere? I left 1/2 way through...what a waste of time Criss angel, also left 1/2 way through horribly boring and lame"
"Jubilee, very boring and both my wife and almost fell asleep."
The only 2 shows that I have been disappointed by so far are KA and MJ: ONE.
"Never seen a bad show, since I tend to rely on TA reviews a lot."
"I have to agree with Irishdiva, Follies Bergere was awful! we wanted to see a classic vegas showgirl show, ugh, waste of money!!"
"""I'll probably be yelled at for this but I didn't enjoy LOVE when I went about 4 years ago with my boyfriend. I was actually bored.""I wholly agree - the Liverpool connection seemed to make it an obvious choice but both my wife and myself struggled to stay awake during the show."
"Hirockyjoe we can top that. We went to jubilee and both of us did fall asleep! Sat towards the back and couldnt even see the stage, so boring.Clive"
ZarkanaI've liked all other CdS shows I have seen in Las Vegas. But this was disappointing. At least the tickets were free
"Danny Gans, went in 2010 it was dead, no energy at all. Heard they re-tooled the show went back in 2011 and it was stale to outright rotten in parts."
"I will have to say KA. We were initially bored out of our minds, which then changed into hysteria and laughter."
"Fell asleep at Love...like a deep fall out of your seat sleep. Reluctantly went to Terry Fator because 6 dealers and a pit boss highly recommended the show at Cosmo. We were bored out of our mind and surrounded by kids and a much older crowd. But the man is very talented at what he does, if you can watch him for 90mins ( I think it felt like 6 hours)"
"#1 - Jubilee - just so boring and cheesy.#2 - Love - I hate Cirque in the first place, but I thought the Beatles music would help me enjoy it. Nope. After 15 minutes I was ready to go.#3 - Bite - my boyfriend at the time chose it. So corny."
I fell asleep at love a few weeks ago... But blame it on jet lag...!
Zumanity. Wasn't up to cirque standards IMO.
"+1 for Zumanity. The tickets were a pre-wedding gift from friends and they said it was really fun and sexy. It was raunchy but not fun, and I can handle raunchy if it's done right. This was just uncomfortable."
I agree on Love as well. I've enjoyed other CDS but 4 of us went and 4 of us slept :-/
"Chris Angel without a doubt, I think I have more magic talent than him!!!"
Has to be criss angel and jabbawokeez

"KA , found it boring and also fell asleep (couldn't even blame jet lag)"
"Amazing Jonathon (2012), first show back after a bad car accident. Saw him in 2001, it was a great show back then."
Thank god no one has said Olivia Newton John or a fight would break out! ;)
Criss angel was terrible...was our last night too - what a waste!
I was disappointed in KA. It was our second show that we had ever seen in Vegas. The first as O so that set the bar pretty high.
Oh no rhinoman these are the two we have booked next week!Never fancied KA but heard great things so finally booked it..
"Chris Angel without a doubt. He is about street worthy, at best. Lame."
"Chris Angel without a doubt. Street worthy magic, at best. Lame."
Penn & Teller and Vinny Favarito
The worst show I saw was Paranormal at Bally's. The big final act they invited an audience member on stage and when the host asked if they met before he said yes at the last show and you invited me back! LOL
ONJ. She just can't hit the high note. Oh and Chris Angel and his dime store magic tricksEdited: 5 years ago 
"Divas, we walked out after 15 minutes. Michael Jackson One, we would have walked out as well had I not shelled out over $400 for tickets.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Believe was a load of rubbish,"
"I've been to some really great shows in Vegas...but then I remembered. We saw ""Spirit of the Dance"" at the Golden Nugget. The dancers were out of step with their prerecorded foot stomps. It was a poor imitation of ""Lord of the Dance"". We teased the person who picked the show endlessly. She got in the last laugh. For Christmas that year, we all received ""Spirit of the Dance"" t-shirts!"
"1) Criss Angel - Less than five real magic tricks (many repeated), lots of ego, and super boring.2) The Amazing Jonathan - Showed up late, wasted, and the show took place in a little meeting room with less than 30 audience members. I had so much second-hand embarrassment for this guy."
"I hated Jabbawockeez. I was disappointed in MJone, had higher expectations."
"Olivie Newton John in about 1978. Most of her show was video of her in the movie Grease. Kenny Rogers was her opening act and he was fabulous. ONJ was about what you would expect and about half of the people in the audience left in the middle of her show.But, I did like seeing her in those skin tight black leather pants when they showed her Grease scenes."
"David Spade, and it's not even close.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I echo Ka, Love and Penn + Teller on my ""miss"" list."
"Ka was blah for me. The stage broke partway through so we never got to see the big final act, got reimbursed for our tix. Even up to that point I was a bit bored."
1. Blue Man Group. Just....so....not....entertaining.2. O. <Yawn>3. Vegas! The Show. Butt shaking waste of time that was disgraceful to the people it was allegedly paying tribute to IMHO.
"Lion King (made for children),Chris Angel (boring),Sin City Comedy (Yuck)."
Crazy Girls.
"For post #17Daniel Davies Gans (October 25, 1956 – May 1, 2009)"
man I wish I could sleep sitting up in a crowded and noisy auditorium like so many of you claim to have done. it could be the worst show ever and I could be dead on my feet and could NEVER sleep like that. ka was a disappointment for us
"Blue Man Group, walked out mid show with terrible headache, got the ticket for free and I wouldn't see it again even if they're to pay me."
Thank you everyone for letting me know we aren't the only ones who were less than impressed with some of our show choices. I had completely forgotten about The Amazing Jonathan Show! Ya it was bad too! I feel like I have to see Big Elvis at some point because everyone mentions it as being so bad..I know it is going to stink and I am kinda looking forward to that in a sick way! We see that guy hanging around in the Harrahs Carnival Court area from time to time. Lots of laughs reading peoples posts!
"Oh....and Jersey Boys!!!! Thanks for that heads up!!!! SO glad I didn't buy tix for our trip next week!!!! I almost did but kinda had a feeling it was over hyped so figured I would put it in the back burner again. Kinda the way we felt about Human Nature!!!!! So many people love that show we were so excited to see it. For us it fell flat. The Motown songs of course were wonderful and brought back memories and the guys had good voices I suppose. However, they had no rhythm whatsoever and that could not be hidden from where we sat! It was comical and we still laugh about it!!!Edited: 5 years ago "
1-9 Blue Man Group (only been once but it seemed like it lasted as long as 9 shows before it was finally over)10 Sin City Comedy
Criss Angel Believe
"In 2013 I was in Vegas for 2 weeks on vacation. We saw lots of shows, the worst , on that it as very amateurist was Veronic . We even had free tickets, and were moved to a table up close by the stage. Hopefully, the show has improved .We stayed at the MGM, and saw Ka. I was s bored for good while, but have to say, it got better. That giant slab?? was quite a prop. We also saw LOVE, my family loves the Beatles music. Yet, something felt missing from the production.Bobbi"
"David Copperfield - he was bored by his own show.If it was not for his hard working team and watching them, it would have been a complete waste of money."
"Veronic?! Wow, tough crowd - I thought she was good.For me, it has to be O and Z (arkana). Nothing wizard about them at all."
"Chriss Angel! I am a massive fan of his tv show but the vegas show was just rubbish. The magic tricks were too reliant on props & nothing had that wow factor. The entire concept of the show was just naff. I went back a year later as I had heard due to negative reviews he had updated the show.....wrong! The entire thing was the same, including his jokes about women & appearing in the newspapers a lot. Zzzzzzz"
"For me, it's Criss Angel hands down. It was so bad that only rabbits were remembered after the show."
"It has to be Love. But I went against my better judgement because of the reviews, so my fault. It was soooo boring and I slept through alot. I tried so hard to stay awake but in the end all I could hope for was that I didnt start snoring in front of everyone!"
"David Spade - the only redeeming part of the show was Kevin Farley opening.Crazy Girls -- cheesy and stupidZarkana - I fell asleep during a couple of years ago - plus I was feeling ill after eating at Nine not so fine Irishmen. But, we are going to see again in August - tickets free myvegas. Hope it is better."
"I am a huge fan of Blue Man Group, but their show at Monte Carlo sucks. I am also a huge fan of Penn & Teller. However, since I like their work I have seen a lot of it. Their Vegas show had nothing I had not seen on TV before so I was bored. It was nice to meet them after the show though.Ka was very boring."
"Basically all the Vegas shows are potentially rubbish, disappointing and will send you to sleep?"
Yep that's the general consensus Spendy
Matt Goss - but it appears I am the only one who thinks so.
"Fully agree with Blue Man ,an absolute rip off and very boring how is it still running? . Love was disappointing . To be honest I find most of the CDS shows to be a bit tedious .We were really happy with DCs show as it was in a small theater and we were in the front row. He is very popular in Russia and I actually saw him in a night club way back in the 90s . We really enjoyed the show ."
"TA is full of people suffering from narcolepsy if you believe all the ""i fell asleep"" posts."
"Haha, seahawx. Or too much daytime drinking I think."
"Is there a show that isn't on someone's ""worst"" list? I would have thought shows like LOVE and Jersey Boys would be pretty ""bulletproof"" but I guess not..."
I can't believe le reve got mentioned. People must not research shows before they go.
"Dizzying effects of alcohol, lights dimmed low, soothing CDS music playing in the background, MyVegas BOGO seats, and zero interest in the people flying around, above, and below you. Sleep happens. The kind of sleep where you wake up wondering if you were loud breathing and/or snoring. And wondering how the show could possibly still be going."
1.Penn &Teller .so boring I fell asleep2. Chriss Angel. I'm a big fan but the show was lousy
My worse show was Criss Angel. Very boring.
ahhh another narcolepsy sufferer.....we have an epidemic
"Well....different strokes for different folks!! There are definitely some that have a consensus of distain and most can agree they suck. Still many that didn't make the list at all....so far! For example...we totally enjoyed Carrot Top, Tony & Tina's Wedding (when it was at the Rio years ago) and saw many others that, while not great, were not horrible either. Liked a few that others have mentioned here as hating....like Vinnie Favorito & Jubilee.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Disdain...I know I made a spelling error!!! Hate that!!!Also, for those that save their tickets stubs like we do...Google ""concert ticket albums"" . They are perfect for storing tickets and you can personalize them if you want to. We are on our 3rd album... One that is strictly concerts, one that is 1/2 theater and 1/2 Vegas shows and the 3rd is sporting events."
@seahawxits not narcolepsy or exaggeration. When in Vegas most people are running on very little sleep and lots of alcohol and adrenaline. Have them sit down in a dark room for a few hours and one can easily fall asleep if the show is not exciting them.
"Just wanted to correct a few mistakes.Mac King is the best matinee show on the Strip and an excellent performer in general.LOVE is more than a Beatles tribute show. It condenses the times and the Beatles that transport the audience to a wonderland.Jersey Boys is more than a ""jukebox"" show. It tells the Four Seasons story in a fresh and innovative show.Now there is no defense for Chris Angel."
Menopause the musical....looked at my watch through the whole thing. To be fair it was my 3rd show in 4 nights...I probably shouldn't have gone. Rita Rudner...her comedy was fine but both the husband and I kept nodding off.
"Slept through ""O""...so bored."
"i disagree. I can not imagine truly falling asleep in a loud crowded theatre, while siting up. I think many exaggerate their displeasure in a show by saying ""it made me sleep"". just my opinion."
I hated Zumanity and even though I love all types of dancing I did not care for Jabbawokeez at all.
I hated Zumanity and even though I love all types of dancing I did not care for Jabbawokeez at all.Edited: 5 years ago 
"Seahawx....I actually was nodding off a bit during Love....no exaggeration, not even saying I completely disliked the show as I did like the acts, I was just a bit disappointed overall as it was so well built up here on this forum and I didnt think it lived up to the hype. But, I did spend some time sitting at the VP bar watching football and drinking some very good drinks before the show....might have had a little something to do with the nodding off in a dark theater lol."
"Toni Braxton, I've always loved her music, but she talked more than she sang, very disappointing.KA, it wasn't that bad, but it just didn't do anything for my husband and I, I'm not sure which was worse KA or O, KA was KAKA and O was just Oooo Sooo boringViva Elvis, was very bubble gummish, kind of lame, maybe that's why it didn't do so wellJubilee for a 1st time experience was okay, we had more fun with all the people sitting at our table!"
"I appreciate all the hard work and dedication that the performers put into a show but sometimes even that is not enough. I've seen KA twice (both endings) the second time only because my husband hadn't seen it. It was as boring and long the second time as it was the first. My husband on our last trip wanted to see Blue Man Group, the kids in the audience loved it.....me not so much.SeahawxMy husband woke me up during BMG, Zarkana and KA, and I know I dozed off during O and Mystere. I used to wonder how my Mother could fall asleep literally anywhere at the drop of a hat, all I had to do was hit 60 and its easy really ;-)"
BLUE MAN SUCKED!!!!! It was the most ridiculous and annoying show ever!!!!! THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT was Cher. She is so cool.
"This is a great example of each to their own. The 3 shows the OP mentions-1. Copperfield- i ended up on stage so its probably a lifelong memory.2. BMG- we went to cheapo ticket place with an open mind looking for some cheap entertainment-cost about $40 each and had a ball.3. P&T, had the guy at ticket booth in stitches with laughter so he upgraded our seats. We enjoyed it big time.Our own worst shows- Jubilee, slept thru most of it. Cher- if i wanted to watch a video id have rented one! Talking of falling asleep at shows- getting upgraded at the Joint @ The HardRock when we went to see Santana. 20 feet front and center away from Carlos strutting his stuff and i still fell asleep. Great show, what i saw of it :-)D1700-10"
"More examples of sleeping-Jubilee, i suspected it wouldnt excite is too much but it was a bucket list type thing to do so we went. Took 10 minutes before wifey was nudging me when i was dropping off. She gave up after a while and i fell asleep proper. Woke, opened my eyes and a bit of the stage had risen and there were dancing girls on top of the raised part. As i opened my eyes theres 1 of the girls strutting her stuff directly in front of us looking straight into my eyes (once they were open) I actually felt uncomforably guilty, wasnt her fault i was bored or the pile of drink that had been consumed. Was glad when she left the stage :-)D1700-10"
Evil dead the musical. Watched this last week and walked out before the end. Could hardly understand a word of what was being shrieked at the audience. Dreadful.
vegas the show
Terry Fator. Guy is so talented but he never finished a song and the show was just too cheesy for me.
"BITE - Don't know if it is still around but it was truly awful. Expected to not like Blue Man Group, but it was a terrific show! This kind of thread can go on for awhile, because EVERY show will have its detractors."
"Ka, reminded me of gym class.."
I'm not into shows that much.I could have taken naps at all shows I've ever seen.They're all great for about a 1/2 hour then become monotonous.I would gladly pay 1/3 of the price for a shorter show.
"Zarkana was horrible for my husband and I. We were glad we got tickets for free.I loved LOVE the FIRST time I saw it. It was my first ever Cirque show. However, after seeing O, Zumanity, Ka, Zarkana, and Mystere we went back to Love and I can see how people would fall asleep. I wanted to leave. It was boring the second time around compared to other Cirque shows. I think Love is more about the music and dancing and less about acrobatics, flexibility and feats of strength.I'm baffled how people didn't like Ka. I totally fell in love with the story line of it. I guess it just depends......some don't want a story, other love that sort of thing :)"
Criss Angel by a country mile.
We have twoThe worst show for us was The Australian Bee Gee's. They were so wooden I actually think they thought they were the real thing. They were just like robots performing and they looked through the audience rather than at us. Second was Cher at Caesars Palace. When she finished her first song she went into a foul mouthed tirade and basically told us if we didn't like her we could **** off. That set the mood for the rest of her show which was very mediocre and as we were walking out after the show most people were of the same opinion as us that it was awful. We would never watch her again even if it was for free.
"Honestly, most of these responses are hilarious: Reviews of shows from people who probably don't see many live performances where they live. Two CDS shows and suddenly they're review writers for the New York Times ;)Lighten up kids. Even the 'worst' shows mentioned here still employ hard working and eager young performers, just looking to keep a job."
"Speaking of falling asleep during something...I used to live in S, Cali and went to Disneyland several times. I do not believe I even once could stay awake during the Tiki Lounge song where a ""bird"" MCs the show and there are rain and thunder sounds and dark. I think it is a good show, but it makes me so sleepy. ''Now, I am surprised by anyone listing Ka or Jersey Boys. Both were very good in my book. But I will say CDS shows are overpriced. My favorite shows have really been headliners. I enjoyed Bette Midler, Elton John,Rod Stewart, Donny and Marie, and even Roseanne. No falling asleep in any of those. :-)"
"""O"" was miserable.My wife and I went with another couple and about 30 minutes in she said 'If you want to go,let's go"" My buddy then whispered to me without knowing what my wife said that if there was an intermission,he and his wife were not coming back!!! It was awful!!!!!"
"Love the posts here! Thank you everyone for sharing!! We personally have never been fans of CDS shows. When you've seen one you've seen them all for the most part. People flopping around and around and around!!! We liked LOVE because it was more artistic dance then CDS...well I like it, husband was not impressed really. Of coarse the music and walk through an era helped for me. Zumanity was a bit different then the norm as well.As far as people just trying to make a living...I get that. However, I am not going to go give pity support with my time and $ when a show is not worth it. I have to make a living too and my $, and more importantly vacation hours, are not feeling the ""I know we suck, but come see us any way"" vibe."
"With this thread combined with the pet peeve threads, one might think Las Vegas is closer to the worst travel destination than the best one."
"DTC ""one might think"". Who ?????Posting about a show that you didn't like is a far stretch from "" this is the worst travel destination"" Ahhhh...the exaggeration of peoples comments and reading into their innermost thoughts continues. Humor."
.....combined with pet peeves.
"""Lighten up kids. Even the 'worst' shows mentioned here still employ hard working and eager young performers, just looking to keep a job.""I guess by that theory we should keep going to restaurants with lousy food so the waiters can keep their jobs."
Criss Angel Believe - you've seen these magic tricks many times beforeZumanity - the risqué humor fell flatSin City Comedy - just not funny
"""I guess by that theory we should keep going to restaurants with lousy food so the waiters can keep their jobs.""My sentiments exactly Irishfan......Edited: 5 years ago "
"Either a show or a restaurant that is awful, does not deserve us throwing our good hard earned money at them.... having said that ... this will date me, but the absolute worst show in Las Vegas that we saw was ""fire and ice"" at the Hacienda. I am not sure what I was expecting but the ice part was all right - which was skating but the fire was the costumes - that looked like fire - such a bad show. My husband and I still laugh about it. Penn and Teller - glad we went, but wouldn't do it again. Too much talking not enough Magic. Blue Man Group - was interesting but wouldn't do it again."
"CDNCher, if I remember that show had Redd Foxx in it. I liked the Hacienda but never saw the show. Absolute worst show was Norm Mcdonald stand up at the Rio a few years ago. Below gutter tasteless attempt at ""humor"" from beginning til we joined the line of people walking out. Agree with David Copperfield. Did about 4 tricks in an hour show, all uninspired. Did make $300 of mine disappear."
"So I take it from this that Absithe, Rock of Ages or any of the ""risqué"" shows are the only ones guaranteed to keep you awake? :)"
*Absinthe obviously
"celine dion in 2012 , fell asleep !!"
Defending the Caveman....left after 20 minutes of male-female stereotype jokes; not our genre.
My wife and I have seen most of the shows and have enjoyed most of them. The one memorable disappointment was Zombie Burlesque. I had posted a Trip Advisor review last summer about it. It was strongly recommended by several people and we were really excited to see it. The cast did try really hard and the audience seemed to enjoy it but the jokes fell flat and we were very bored!
"National Hardware Show was boring. Happens in May every year for 3 straight days. Was very excited, so I bought passes. Upon entering, people in business suits everywhere and Hardware Companies Stalls. I don't recommend it to people looking to have fun."
We actually hated LOVE! Got up and left about 30 minutes into it. It was just BORING to us. I know many people love this show....but I don't know why.
"I've been to Vegas only a handful of times so haven't seen all the shows others have listed here but here are my ratings of the ones I have seen:Loved:Elton John at Caesars--he sang all his hits and interacted with the crowd. I would love to see him again!Blue Man Group--loved every minute including the casino parade before the performanceCarrot Top: A surprise! I normally don't care for this comedian at all but his show is hilariousSo So:Ka Boring although the stunts with the moving stage were interesting.Love: I love the Beatles and overall the show was fine but I was expecting more acrobatics as some have also noted here.Hated:Chris Angel: luckily it was a freebie ticket from MyVegas. Completely lame, lazy and uninterestingPhantom of the Opera: enjoyed the chandelier but the rest of the show (which was basically only music from the Broadway performance) was mediocre."
"When I went to Vegas with a good friend many years ago, the most expensive show we saw was Danny Gans, and his show came highly recommended. We were disappointed in the short length of the show, about 55 minutes, for the price, which was high compared to other shows we saw on that trip. His show was good but very overpriced.On another trip, again many years ago, we saw a man billed as the ""naughty hypnotist."" It was NOT good. My sister wanted to see a hypnotist but didn't want to ""waste"" her time doing any research. So she asked me to take care of it for the group of female relatives we traveled with. She still throws digs about the show my way. I'm thinking it's time to get over it. LOLI was somewhat disappointed by Defending the Caveman. It just wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I am glad we got the tickets at half price.Although I wasn't disappointed by Big Elvis, I just don't get all the hype about his show.I am surprised by some of the shows people put on their ""worst, most disappointing"" list. Some of them are among my favorites and others I enjoyed very much. That's why reviews need to be taken lightly. What one person hates may be a good choice for another person."
The Price is Right....
"""Nudes on Ice"" at the Plaza Downtown in the 1980's. Than it was called the Union Plaza. I enjoyed it (ice skating with boobs everywhere), my wife hated it.I did not like KA. Saw ""O"" the second day it opened and wrote Steve Wynn a letter telling him how disappointed we were. Received a full refund and several comps. The good old days!"
"Just fell asleep reading all these posts....KA on a Saturday after a CCR concert on a Friday night not the best idea, we wasted some $$ in this show, our fault to be fair..."
Frank the man the music
"Blue man group at The Luxor, 10-12 years ago. I paid full price, just wasn't worth that."
"There was some topless magic show I saw ~2000 in either Tropicana or San Remo. I can't say it was terrible because even though the show wasn't great, there was still half a dozen topless ladies to look at."
Oh No! We have tickets for the show this Friday for Frank the Man. I was a sleeper at Jersey Boys. My husband still makes fun of me. Not JB;s fault. Just a long Las Vegas Day.Edited: 4 years ago 
"Absinthe for both myself and hubby.... maybe we weren't in the right frame of mind or ?? Just were bored, couldn't wait for it to be over. But I do agree with late nights, lots of action during the day, a few or alot of drinks during the day and you get into a comfy chair and its dark , also if you are bored you might tend to doze off....."
"Interesting thread. There are some clear winners here. Criss Angel has the Number 1 spot I think. Though i had never heard of him until I read this forum. he is not a name in the UK.Our upcoming trip to Las Vegas will be our first and initially I had visions of seeing a show almost every night we were there, and not being able to choose from a long list which ones to see. The reality has been quite different. Ther are not many show that are on currently which peak our interest. I have a feeling I will get bored in any CdS show after the first half hour. Even as a kid I used to get bored at the Circus! We had shortlust Le Reve but it is closed whilst we are in town, so opted for free Zarkana tickets courtesy of MyVegas. I have a feeling everyone who sees Zarkana does so with these free tickets!We are also going to see Showstoppers at The Wynn as we plan to spend a night there seeing the show, a meal at Wing Lei and then spend time around the resort. We thought in would be a modern, old style show and I like stage musicals.Other than that nothing is booked. We may see Absinthe or Carrott Top if we are at a loose end one evening and cheap tickets are available. Jersey Boys was on the shortlist and whilst I would enjoy the songs, I have a feeling the actual story may bore me somehow. Another ""may do"" whilst there perhaps?None of the big name shows appeal. Elton I saw in the 80s and loved his old stuff but I really dislike his leter woek- that really would send me to sleep.As we will be in London for a few days before going on to Vegas we decided to see some shows there to compensate. And as much as I enjoy ane evening at the theatre or a concert, too many in a short period can take away some of the excitement.I guess who i really wanted was to see whilst visiting Vegas is the (real) Elvis but I am a few decades too late!!!"
"@Mr. Cinnamon I saw Elton last time he was in Boston (last year or the year before). His set is almost entirely 70s and 80s stuff with maybe 1 song from 90s on. I took a gander at his current setlist and it's pretty much the same.Not trying to talk you into it, just giving the head's up that's it's all classic Elton stuff."
Thanks CallMeDR.Just checked- he is not in town when we are there anyway. Maybe another time. His was the first rock concert I ever saw way back in the day (1984). Jeez where did those 31 years go?
"@Mr. Cinnamon, if you see Carrot Top, you will not have a chance to become bored or fall asleep as you will be too busy laughing and trying to catch your breath! He is a laugh riot, very fun and funny show!!! We walked out of the theater rubbing our cheeks as the muscles were tense from laughing so much. Great show. Have a great trip."
"Lion King. I had to leave half way through. Had to lie to my kids though,because they got me the tickets for Christmas."
Jubiilee - the only show that I fell asleep. Boring...
"I saw 'O' and honestly wanted to cut my wrists after 20 minutes!! Yet my girlfriend loved it, we're all different i guess and impressed by different things. I'd rather see a concert if anyone good is in town, shows just don't do it for me!"
We were so looking forward to Love and just didn't enjoy it at all.
"I hate to say it but after 12yrs of not making it to O I finally went this year and found it so boring!!!! I'm not entirely sure I even know what it was about. People had always raved about it so I probably went in with too high an expectation. I couldn't wait for it to finish!The other show which I found absolutely terrible was Criss Angel. Tricks were poor, Cirque theme was non excistant and it was just dull. Never again!!"
"The mentalist disappointment me, the whole act I've seen before done with more stage presence plus the que and being hearded for the v theatre was terrible The lion king had poor accustics and didn't really have any atmosphere, tickets were free though so that was okKa was ok if I would have paid full price would have been disappointed thoughHowever as opposed to everyone else on here I loved zumanity and love both exceeding my expectations"
"And big elvis is a legend, fantastic singer and a really nice guy"
A vote from me for Vegas - The Show. It was dire! We had thought that we did really well to get seats very near the front - big mistake. There was a dreadful magician on who had the scariest eyes I have seen outside of a horror movie. Near the end of his act (which seemed to go on forever) he 'magically produced' some birds. That explained why his jacket had been moving all the way through his act.Viva Elvis was also a big disappointment.Having said all of that we must remember that all of our reviews are subjective. I absolutely loved Jersey Boys but respect that some wouldn't enjoy it. It's just about impossible to be totally objective about a show. If we all liked the same stuff it would be a boring world.
"David Copperfield show is THE WORST! Total waste of money. Boring, nothing interesting about it."
"Just got back from Vegas on the weekend and saw two shows. I liked Love, though I concur that there is less acrobatics than some would expect. Glad I saw that alone, I think my daughter would have been disappointed.Also saw the Australian Bee Gees courtesy of MyVegas. Glad I didn't pay for this one. While I loved the music, the singer doing the Barry Gibbs part was so inarticulate that it was almost impossible to make out the words when he sang. The other 2 were fine. And the chairs were desperately uncomfortable, so that didn't help."
Not too surprising since he died in 2009.
"He is not dead. Robin, Maurice and Andy are all deceased. Barry is the last brother surviving."
