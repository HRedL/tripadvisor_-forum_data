"I’m supposed to leave next Wednesday and am really struggling with what to do, and I feel like trying to find updated info is difficult (don’t particularly trust the CDC right now). If you were traveling with a teen, would you go? We are also supposed to do two days in Paris, and I’m thinking maybe I just cancel that? Thanks in advance"
"Will sites, events be open to even bother going? To date, patients are increasing and places are shutting down. It sure does not seem worth it to me."
What has shut down in London?
"I'm departing for London on Wednesday and as far as I know, nothing tourist related has shut down, it's business as usual but with more hand washing.Everyone has a different comfort level with risk, but IMO it's probably better to go now rather than in a month or two, especially if everythingis already booked and I assume partially paid for. Sensible info here:https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation…Edited: 2:03 am, March 10, 2020 "
"No one here can make the decision for you, so I'm not sure what you're hoping to get out of this. But I would certainly continue with your plans. If anything, tourist numbers may be down so annoying queues might not be something you'll experience. So it might be your best holiday ever."
"Places may he closing down in Arizona (where azalice lives) but as far as I can see (and I live in London) things are going on as normal. I haven’t seen or heard of any sights, restaurants or bars closing."
"In your case (given the current situation) I would travel to London but cancel France. The issue isn’t personal safety; you can take all precautions by washing your hands frequently and carrying tissues or napkins to touch your face. And then you’d very likely be fine. The issue is the risk of having to self-isolate on return to the US. Right now that’s not an issue with the UK. Might it be in a couple of weeks? Possibly, but compared to France, Germany and (yikes) Italy the UK is currently in a much better situation. Right now flying from London/UK to anywhere is probably the safest bet to avoid questions on arrival. Your choice. Good Luck.Edited: 2:58 am, March 10, 2020 "
Italy has just gone into total shutdown. If you come to the U.K. next week you might just be able to visit places before the same happens here. I feel fairly certain the measures implemented in Italy will be used in the U.K. in a few weeks. It’s only a matter of time.
"Yes, I would cancel.The UK govt expects to see a significant rise in cases in the next 10 to 14 days."
I have the same dilemma about an upcoming trip to Paris that I booked some time ago. But London is carrying on as normal and everything open. Yesterday in central London I saw only three people wearing masks and London looked like London always does. Would I come? Probably yes.
"SOme great info in the link in post 3. I posted this in the Amsterdam forum the other day so re-posting here. Still relevant.>>Apparently scientists have identified a new strain of this virus called H15-Steria. It is far more widespread than the COVID-19 strain and causes people to lose all grip on reality and perspective and causes them to panic buy toilet roll for some reason.Some people have even been known to buy rolls of kitchen paper and cut them in half as an emergency supply. Victims of this strain also seem to be confusing this virus with dysentery hence the panic toilet roll buying thing. Very worrying.H15-Steria also seems to prevent people from leaving their homes except to go to Costco for toilet rolls. Also makes them think they should ditch the thousands they have spent on trips.Sounds like you might be already infected with H15-Steria so go to your nearest rational friend, wearing a useless face mask of course, and have them talk sense into you.<<"
I wouldn’t let Coronavirus affect anything. I think people are just preguessing what will happens next. Nobody knows yet.
"Wearing masks is something that some people do at anytime of year and as advised by the WHO no need to do so unless you are looking after an infected person.To the OP whether or not you travel is very much a personal decision as things, in the UK are currently open for business. This may well change.I am healthy enough that I suspect I would survive any infection of COVID-19 and could manage isolation for a couple of weeks. I have relatives with underlying conditions who would be in a very different situation and if I thought I was in a situation where I could catch the virus I would be avoiding contact with them.YMMVEdited: 5:35 am, March 10, 2020 "
Brilliant!
Where exactly has shut down in the UK?
">>> Apparently scientists have identified a new strain of this virus called H15-Steria. <<<It's also mutated into a new strain called P4N1C-B1Y. It causes muscle fatigue and hernias in victims when trying to navigate overloaded trolleys around supermarket car parks.Edited: 6:10 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I don’t think your decision rests on what others say London is operating as usual. There is a reason actions are taking place worldwide to try to contain this virus. Traveling on a plane, metro, train; going out and about in crowds; waiting in lines to get into a venue; eating in crowded restaurants......at this time they come with some risk. Chances are you will be fine traveling but you have to be conscious of what you might face if you do come down with the virus.....self quarantine in a foreign country possibly at your expense; delays returning home for a variety of scenarios; etc Very difficult decision to travel right now or in the near future......."
"""Where exactly has shut down in the UK?""A sports centre in Glasgow was closed over the weekend but has since reopened."
"Your trip is a high risk proposition. There have already been many closures and cancellations in Paris, and most educated commentators expect an Italy-style lockdown to be imposed there within the next two weeks.London may take longer as it currently has far fewer cases, and measures may be less drastic, but it will happen.Once lockdown is imposed, it is likely your own country's government will officially advise its citizens not to travel, as the FCO has just done for Italy. If this happens, the bonus is that many travel insurance policies will kick in, so you may at least be able to recover the costs of your travel and perhaps accommodation.Edited: 6:40 am, March 10, 2020 "
"MCLT, you also need to consider the situation in your home country. What is your government saying about domestic travel? Presumably you’ll need to get to the airport and board a plane. Both times when you could just as easily catch the virus as in the UK or France.Edited: 6:46 am, March 10, 2020 "
I would. You might be carriers (the virus is asymptomatic for quite a long period) and as usual we are doing absolutely nowt to test people coming into the country.
This morning's official advice:https:/…
"There is perception among the general public that everything, apart from panic buying toilet rolls, is carrying on as normal. That is very much NOT the case! Many large organisations have banned their staff from travelling within the UK. At my company our sales team are having an increasing number of meetings being cancelled. I was going to attend a presentation by a government department next week, but all such events are now cancelled. The government is telling the public one thing, but doing a lot more behind the scenes."

"OK comrade, you've had your say."
“ His main priority is to not spook the markets ” that’s not going too well is it? How do you link lightning changes in world oil prices to the UK Government?Alternatively the PM is guided by science as seen in the joint news conference yesterday with the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. These are deeply professional figures of great integrity (and not politicians).
I think Coronavirus threads are spreading on this forum much faster than the actual coronavirus.
"I strongly agree that traveling at this time, especially international travel, is very risky. Sure, you might have an event free trip but what are the potential consequences if there are drastic changes at home or in the countries you are visiting. We have a handful of cases here yet stores and malls are “dead.” That number could shoot up tomorrow....most are expecting that to happen. Not to get political there are inept politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. Testing in the US has been abysmal.....who knows the numbers.Should you cancel? Possibly you could try to get refunds, credits, postponements. I would not want to gamble on traveling right now."
"We are in the same situation, supposed to leave next Friday (20 March) for London for a few days and then Paris (returning to Miami from Paris the following Friday). Also considering canceling only Paris, and just going to London. Or not going at all. At this point, I'm waiting to make a decision next week, or whenever new travel warnings are issued. Tickets, hotels, theatre tix all non-refundable. :( I'm also traveling with 3 children (ages 15, 12, and 9). I am worried about quarantine there or when we return, and obviously even if we are not the demographic likely to get seriously ill from this, we would not want to transmit to anyone else. It's a hard decision! Good luck and let us know what you ultimately decide, and your experience!"
"I think anyone who thinks the situation will improve rather than get worse over the next few weeks is fooling themselves. How bad it gets either in the US, London or Paris is a crapshoot.To help make your decisions economically more palatable why not call each hotel and venue to see what they may offer in the way of refunds, credit vouchers, etc.......worth a shot to do it now so you know your options. You should also contact your travel insurance company now to find out what you are and are not covered for should you decide to go........medical, quarantine accommodations, flight change.......leave nothing to chance.Good luck.Edited: 12:11 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I’m in London right now and haven’t experienced any shut downs!! Just got in from Westminster Abbey!
"Unfortunately, we switched our 9 night booking and pre-paid about a month ago. I've contacted them and their answer was basically ""get back to us IF your flights get canceled and we can discuss giving you a CREDIT towards a future stay"". So it sounds like if we cancel the trip on our own, we take the hit financially. We are meant to leave tomorrow night and keep toggling back and forth with ""should we stay or should we go?"". Or maybe I was listening to the Clash....ha!"
"Post 30, everything is still open, whether that carries on, who knows. The advice is changing daily.No one knows what may happen even in the next few days"
"Leaving tomorrow for a week in London. Hopefully the skittish will all cancel and leave the attractions to us! :-)Now, if they close Hamilton, I will be truly saddened."
"welcome, you got alot of great response. this is where you need to buckup and use your own judgement. I know that many people look to TA and others to make decisions for them, but sometimes you need to be the one to sit in the captains chair and bark out orders.Both places will be there tomorrow or whenever this thing blows over and if and when it comes back, again, things will blow over again.If you the type of person that will be worrying 24/7 and wont be able to rest/enjoy the trip and stress out and maybe be a royal B to others due to the stress, then why compound the issue? Stress wont help your immune system either.If there is something special in Paris that is the #1 reason for going. I would make sure its open for you to attend. If not, ask youself, will or can you be happy with the rest of your plans.good luck"
"rc #34 that might be the single best piece of advice I've ever read on a TA forum. Kudos to you. Perfect, hope the OP listens"
"Paris I would definatly cross off your list (sorry) as for London, at the moment it's business as usual in most places but that could change by next week"
We are now getting to the stage where I think the virus will be more prevalent in America than here. Time to start discouraging Americans from visiting.
"I'm just back from a week in Nevada and Louisiana.Hysteria in America is much more that it was in London before I left.Frequently washing your hands will only be properly effective if everyone else does.I believe the toilet roll shortage is caused by a factory in China closing and creating a shortage. This information was passed though the Chinese community to Australia who then panic bought out all the stock over there. Papers then reported this and as people only read headlines this panic has spread to the UK.Ignore the tales, after all you can only catch it once. So better to get it over and done with."
"Ignore the tales, after all you can only catch it once. So better to get it over and done with.That's a bit of a reckless commentIgnore the tales....for whatever reason people ARE panic buying so to ignore tales of lack of toilet tissue, hand gel soap ect could find you unable to find anyAs for 'you can only catch it once, I clearly remember reading about someone who'd got it twice and finally 'better to get it over and done with....I don't know where to begin with this, firstly not everyone is going to 'get over it' although it's true deaths are minimal at the moment here however of those that do 'get over it who knows who else they would've passed it on to ie an old person in a shop, an asthmatic on a bus"
"A young person might get over it But a point to ponder An elderly person who observes all advice to wash hands , stay home as much as possible etc , if they catch it will probably suffer serious consequences and maybe even die.The likelihood is that they will have caught it from a younger , much younger person who will not have such serious effects.Please start taking this seriously YOU might only catch it just once but how many elderly people will catch it from YOU?Edited: 9:59 am, March 11, 2020 "
MCLT and others ...Reply to: Should I cancel? - For London - No.As for Paris then see the Paris Forum and French health advice and then any other advice about returning from either country to your home country.EnjoyAnthony K
"I can't tell you what to do, since things are changing everyday, but we just retuned from our trip to London and Dublin today and things seemed very normal around, with the exception of very few people walking around with masks. The attractions were all open the past week and the LHR/LAX the airports we used had no extra procedures that we had to go through. Besides the Corona Virus signs everywhere, to be careful and wash hands often, it all seemed normal. We carried Lysol wipes and hand sanitizers and were careful about touching too much stuff around public areas, but besides that nothing much to report."
"Only the traveler can make the decision to go or cancel the trip, as each person must weigh the +/- factors.Asking a travel forum of complete strangers whether you should or should not go to London with COVID-19 spreading is like asking the forum how should remodel your kitchen. There are many forum discussions, as well as, articles to read. Only you can answer your question, not us."
Where are you going?
London exclusively
This is my primary concern along with what will happen at home for my family if I am quarantined
Thank you! I know I ultimately need to decide
What did you decide?

"So you're going to have to make your own call - as someone said in the other thread, you have to captain your own ship and not rely on the advice of strangers. That being said, I just waited 1.5 hours on hold to cancel my trip to London that my family and I were supposed to start tomorrow eve. Here's why: 1) WaPo reporting White House considering making all EU Travel restricted Level 3 - meaning avoid nonessential travel, self-quarantine for 14 days on return 2) traveling with kids, so they are likely going to be quarantined at some point from school in the next 2 months out of abundance of caution and 3) seeing site/sporting/tourism shutdowns here ramping up, so guessing same shortly for London... don't want to go and all of a sudden see the sights CLOSED. Finally, I suspect I wouldn't be fully ""present"" and relaxed/able to enjoy what I'm doing/seeing... hyper-vigilance, telling kids to wash/use Purell all the time, checking my phone for updates on airport/border restrictions, checking in on elderly parents, etc... the Tower and James Bond will still be there, God Willing, and I'll enjoy more another time. Sorry for the novel, best of luck with your decisions! #flattenthecurve"
"Welp, OP here. We are cancelling. Drat. Thanks everyone! Stay healthy!"
"Off to Scotland in May so who knows where this virus will be by then, hopefully a slow down. We have decided to wait until mid-April to make a decision. We have no concerns about the trip over but we do from Edinburgh back to the States as we don't know any condition of like travelers on the same plan and where they originated from"
"Brent, really confused by your post.Are you flying over on a private jet, knowing all members of your traveling party and their recent contacts?"
NoProbably should be concerned flying both ways
"“we don't know any condition of like travelers on the same plan and where they originated from”. Brent, with the number of cases in the US aren’t you concerned about getting to the airport to start your holiday? Or the journey to Scotland?"
"The decision has been made for you.As I understand it, all returnees will be quarantined for 14 days.Who'd have thought that a nasty ""foreign virus"" would cause this much trouble.Bloody Chinese / Europeans!!Not the UK though. We are still safe to visit.Thank god, the UK is not in Europe any more."
"Re Post 56 & ""Thank god, the UK is not in Europe any more.""Which continent are we then a part of? If I may ask...Anthony K"
"Unfortunately doesnt seem to be true that you can only get it once. I would be more worried about catching the virus in America right now than in the uk. You are not testing people, you are not contact tracing, people cant stay home as readily. You have far more spread of the virus than you realise, your death rate shows that. There was a toilet roll panic locally, shops 15 minutes drive away had plenty. - which we didnt need to buy so left on the shelves. There is not a toilet roll shortage and as long as the panic buyers dont continue to buy anything they see the shops will soon be overflowing again.."
We have the same dilemma. Both in mid 70's and concerned about flights and the spread of infection.
"We were leaving the day before you, next Tuesday. We cancelled this afternoon. Why? Not because of the virus, but because we have no control over governments, corporations, etc. We would have been in the Dominican Republic where there are five active cases. Depending on how fast the number of cases are reported, the DR government govt could quarantine the hotel we would be staying at. With travel to Europe suspended, airlines are under tremendous cash flow issues, and could curtail trips back to the US. Customs coming back into the US are going to start checking temps, and if for some other reason you have a temp, you could be quarantined. Way too many risks now! And the virus is the least of my worries."

Joan G you’ll be more likely to get accurate answers if you ask on the Athens or Santorini forums than the Lomdon one. This one is for questions about London.
"First, I am a long time reader and first time poster on this forum. I do (did) have a trip to London planned (and mostly paid for) this spring. Ain't going. Great disappointment.  From what I gather the effort now, on both sides of the Atlantic, is to slow the spread of this illness. Since there is no vaccine and no treatment, this is the best we can do. So it comes to what we as individuals do. Perhaps if I were to travel, I would come into contact with the virus, and perhaps I would not. Perhaps if I unknowingly carried the virus, I would spread it, perhaps I would not. I take it as my responsibility to do what little I can to minimize the impact this is having on all of us. Further, I am an OP (old person). Healthy, but old. I have grandchildren. They are young yet, and I very much want them to carry rich memories of me into their old age, as I do of my grandmothers. And not to be the vaguely-recalled granny who died in the '20 Covid-19 outbreak. I am abandoning my long planned, much anticipated and expensive trip to London and other Europeandestinations for now with great regret. But also the small satisfaction of doing what I think is right. For myself and for others."

people should listen to what WHO is telling us and there government. by travelling to affected areas will only make things worse and not better. this needs to be controlled .stay home and think of your health and your loved ones.
"I agree that at this time the best thing to do is cancel trips to Europe coming up in the next month or so. Even if it is just because many of the sites and attractions will be closed and travel difficult. However, I am trying to cancel a trip to Spain this week and am finding it impossible to get refunds.

"With no disrespect to my fellow TA contributors, but it rather amuses me that loads of total strangers are asking other total strangers to advise what they should do. Should they go on their holiday for which they may have been planning for a long time and spent a lot of money.Surely it would be easier to make that decision by listening to the latest news reports from the country to where you are travelling.I had planned to take my car on the ferry to France on Monday for a 5 day holiday.I had been watching France24 for the last week and reading news reports. Gradually the conditions were deteriorating and museums etc starting to close.I came to the decision not to go. On Thursday I cancelled the accommodation and today, the ferry crossing. I’m glad I did because as from this evening France will be in lockdown."
"Hi, Secretariat1973. I was thinking about this the same way until a few days ago. The issue that seems most important now is not “what’s my personal risk?” but rather “how much can my local hospitals handle before they don’t have enough room/staff/equipment to even try to save the lives of people who can maybe be saved by intensive care?”A week ago I was swimming in a hotel pool and eating dinner in a restaurant. Now I’m staying home and just going out on walks in the woods with my kids and our dogs. And my book club has plans to host a virtual meeting on Monday night. If you told me that last week I would have said we were being hysterical snowflakes. Now it feel like we are being kind and respectful community members who are just doing what we can to slow down the spread of this thing so our local hospitals don’t get too many sick people coming in all once. Please know that I know I can’t convince you to change how you feel. And I appreciate that you are looking to help this person not feel anxious. Thanks for reading this though. And best wishes.Edited: 6:43 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Bravo, Kermit! Well said."
"A week ago, I would have said"" don't be silly,carry on""Now I must say cancel, that's if travel is still possible at all.It's amazing the speed at which the virus has affected travel.Thoughts with the airline and tourist industry workers, they have a bleak future, and for how long?"
Excellent. Really enjoyed reading your post!
"I have had to cancel going to Paris. Eurostar are giving vouchers and my accommodation have said I can postpone the booking, so all is not lost. Luckily I live in the UK, so I will be able to travel again when the situation calms down."
First day working in Westminster for 3 weeks and my train was lovely and empty as was the district line.

"Well I was undecided about my trip this weekend but after hearing the latest announcement from the PM, I’m cancelling. Fortunately BA are giving credits and IHG refunds.Can’t be helped.its gone beyond having fun at all and absolute necessity of,protecting the vulnerable and flattening the curve so the NHS has a chance to help,those worse impacted."
"I believe we will,see fewer ""shall Incancel""'questions now that the answer is painfully obvious. Even if the person asking cannot be persuaded by the ""greater good"" argument, the fact that almost everything is close---tourist attractions. Museums, theatres, shops and restaurants, and even some European borders---makes it pointless to travel. And the planes are not flying. How we can be helpfulmat thismpoint is Point the way to cancel/refund policies for flights, trains, hotel reservations, tours booked, etc. Most airlines are waiving any cancellation fees. And the major hotel chains have stated policies of refundingneven ""non-refundable"" bookings. (I am a beneficiary of the IHG policy mentioned above for the one night we booked at Hotel Indigo at the end of our week's stay in London later this month.Now just waiting for the West End theatres to close down as we have tickets for two plays."
"EnzianOver the next eight weeks I have £1500 tied up in Entertainment, in London's West End and further afield in parts of Greater London.This includes Theatres, Cinemas, Restaurants, Galleries and Museums. Visits for myself and guests, who will not be coming to London from Spain and The Netherlands. Refunds must be offered because ""vouchers,"" which is what Eurostar is offering, are meaningless. CheersAnthony"
"I was due to visit London with Family on Easter break but had cancelled my hotel stay, and got full refund. Waiting to cancel my Delta flight but waiting to get more infoymation regarding bans to/from US so I can ask for money back. For now, it seems that they are offering to waive fees for postponements. But that's not what I want. I just want to cancel and get money back. I have a thread open here for more infromation : https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18633…"
"If you booked with Flighthub, DON'T cancel, they will surprise you with many fees and lie about it blaming the airlines."
Do not tempt the fates. Coronavirus is spreading and this is the truth.
Cancelled my trip for this weekend. Filled in the for. To get a voucher from BA. IHG will refund by non refundable booking tomorrow.

Don't come. I am here now and everything is shut down. All you'll see are empty streets and you can walk around the outside of things like the Acropolis and the temples but you won't be able to go inside. The museums are all closed. It's just no fun to be here as you can't eat out at a restaurant and most of the places you would want to go shopping are closed too.
Sally you are in Athens not London so you are not “ here” at all.
"The person I responded to said they were going to Athens, where I am."
Sally nobody would know that. Replies appear in order that they are made so you need to identify the poster by name or post number.
Thanks
. . . or try posting on the Athens Forum; the clue is in the title . . .
"Unless your travel is absolutely necessary, and you can get back home easily if you choose to come, I would stay away, for the foreseeable future, April 1st at least.Sorry to be so negative, we will miss youAnthony K"
"AnthonyI don’t think you are being negative, just realistic. I had to cancel a trip to France this week and have a couple of other holidays booked, but will just wait and see."
"Thanks ... my Barcelona/Sitges trip, in May, is in the balance ... unlikely to happen, I fear.France, Paris, for me, hopefully in September.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Anthony pretty much in the same boat. As well as cancelling my London trip, started to cancel Daster trip to Mersey and will start cancellations in earnest for my May Australia trip in a few weeks.Provence trip in Muky is hanging in the balance. Hope I can make Córdoba I. Early September but who knows what will happen."

"We must all hope for the future to be better, but must plan for the virus to be climbing to it's peak on into the Summer and then who knows...Only when, in our National newspapers, we see Health professionals, saying that the numbers of those affected and dying is dropping can we hold out any hope of life returning to what we consider to be normal.Anthony K"
"The National Gallery ... During these extraordinary and challenging times, the safety and wellbeing of all our visitors, colleagues and community is paramount.

"Royal Academy, London ... From today our galleries will be closed and all events through to the end of April have been cancelled. If you have a booking, and would like to request a refund, please contact us on 0207 300 8090 or emailtickets@royalacademy.org.uk. Anthony K"
"Totally fair question and it makes sense to ask people who are right there where you are planning on going.We are a family of 4 who (still) have plans to go to London for the last week of March. May seem stupid to some of the know-it-alls who earlier replied, but until I **know** that things will be closed I feel like we cannot afford to lose the near five figures (of US$) I've already paid for this trip. #BritishAirways is offering vouchers for the amount I paid for their airfare (purchased directly through their site, no 3rd party), but when I look at their site at potential future travel dates I can see the voucher they'll provide me will only cover about half the airfare ... which means I'll have to come up with an additional US$3,000-5,000 more to take the same trip. We'd saved for this trip. This was meaningful for us. We're not gadabouts.Every other place (hotel, tours, etc.) is offering more flexible vouchers -- ""based on availability,"" that sort of thing. So will they have ""availability"" when our family with two school-age children can go? We can only travel when school is not in session, of course.My husband and I are daily checking websites for places we want to go and, thus far, they are all open with their cv19 caveats. I reached out to some of the tours I'd booked asking them what they are seeing as they are boots on the ground.So no, we don't want to get sick. Duh.No, we don't want to lose all this money (or end up having to pay oodles more for #BA's price gouging).Yes, we like the idea of helping to, albeit in a small way, support London's travel business.So I get why the initial poster came here last week to seek advice from those there and those just back. I came here today, 17 Mar, for the same reason: what does it look like to those in London."
JuneOK ... much to be saddened by... I have a BA situation that is unresolved ... do you have a question? Anthony K
"In the last hour: the British Museum is closed - Cineworld cinemas are closed - most of London's theatres have now closed - the Woseley and Brasserie Zedel restaurants have closed, as have many, many others - anyone choosing to still come to London at the moment will not have a good time..."
June Boys...you sound like someone who will cut off their nose to spite their face.
"well said - they seem to want to ignore the advice of the UK government for everyone to socially isolate, and want to be a pair of Typhoid Marys.... in France they would be stopped by the police if they walked around, it may come to that here too....Edited: 3:02 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Anthony -- thank you for letting me know you also are dealing with BA. Not that misery loves company but you know what I mean. It's not just me sort of thing.While I know mine is a first world problem it's still an expensive problem to me. British Museum + Sir John Soane's are now closed so I guess that's that.Thanks, and take care. I'll be eating a chocolate bar to try and feel better."
"June said “No, we don't want to lose all this money (or end up having to pay oodles more for #BA's price gouging).”Moving on from the potential for an action for libel...... this sounds like you may have no travel insurance? I have lost a U.K. - Australia trip next week, but at least I’ll get the money back."
"I do, but it won't cover the whole amount. And nobody appreciates a johnny-come-lately, so cool it with the snark."
“ so cool it with the snark.”You chose to post on a public forum - you can’t control the response.
"The situation world wide is worse than I have ever known, in 70 years, in Europe police are fining people for being on the street, all galleries, resturants bars closed.Only essential food stores open.Not quite that bad yet in the UK, but by tommorow, or the next day?International trains being stopped at borders.It's a time to pull together, not snipe at each other, or act selfishly."
Well said Haddaway.
Did see a comment on another site that offers of vouchers rather than refunds do not have to be accepted but these are fluid times. I will have to cancel a Florida trip for end of June as cant see situation over by then. Am getting asked by Virgin to pay trip balance but cant get any info as my travel dates are too far away! payment isnt! Any offer to rebook maybe by next March are still no good but would go same time next year if able. London and Paris are really no goes for anyone checking thread.
"It was reported, on TA, that Eurostar, a few days ago were only offering vouchers and not even discussing refunds with those negatively affected by the Coronavirus.That situation may have changed.Anthony K"
"Perhaps June Boys can explain the places they were planning to go to. Unless you have a very strange itinerary, it’s unlikely that you are actually going to get a trip that is at all worthwhile.That is leaving aside the advice on social distancing, where I completely agree with everyone else."
Just got back from Vietnam. Everything was closing and very difficult to visit touristic sites. I would cancel and wait until everything gets back to normal.
"June_Boys, I understand not wanting to cancel a trip you've looked forward to and planned for so long, however, at this point, you are going to have to realize it can't happen right now. Even if you could get into the UK, or find a flight that is still going from the US to London, your family would not enjoy it.We just returned Monday from Greece and the last three days of the trip were not as enjoyable as they could have been in perfect circumstances. Borders were closing, tourist attractions were shutting down, restaurants were closed, the locals were worried about their livelihoods so not as friendly as they were at the beginning of the week. We were worried about getting back to the US and our teens were very nervous about what was happening in the world. They just wanted to be home, but we couldnt get home any earlier. As disappointing as it may be, stay home and feel safe in your home country and your own surroundings. Although you will lose money and it is inconvenient, you will enjoy it so much more when the city is alive and you can do everything you want to do."
">>And nobody appreciates a johnny-come-lately, so cool it with the snark.<<Ironic given your first post on this thread was well after the 100 others before."
They are saying UK will finally be on official full lockdown this Friday. So hopefully that solves the situation for all of us who wants to receive a full refund for our reservations.
#163 how do you know you will recieve full refund ?
"Parliament is sitting today. Also there will be a further, daily, Press Conference at around 5 pm, UK time.If London, and other parts of the UK, are totally locked down, by Government order, only grocery stores, pharmacies and delivery services might operate; then refunds should, automatically, be forthcoming.All public transport services will be operating a lower number of vehicles and a restricted timetable, due to staff shortages, caused by the virus. Always go to Journey Planners,on Official websites, if you must travel.For example, I have already received two e-mails, in the last four days, from Ticketmaster, about a booking in early April, and they tell me that I do not have to do anything, and they will contact me, again, closer to the time when I might have visited. I hope that all helpsAnthony K"
100% yes to cancel
"""They are saying UK will finally be on official full lockdown this Friday. ""Who are ""They""?"
It's simply crazy to travel right now. Europe is being greatly affected by Covid and businesses are closed. People are in their houses as the risk of getting the disease is too great. Stay at home to stay safe!
"My husband and I are owners of a self-catering cottage in the grounds of our farm, fairly close to the farm house where we live. Access onto the site is shared and I welcome guests, deal with queries, clean after visits. But we have had to self-isolate now due to my husbands health issues, type 1 diabetes, COPD, asthma +. We have holiday bookings throughout the summer. We need to close the cottage and request guests cancel but letting agents seem ambivalent. Do you think we are right to want to close for the forseeable, perhaps to reschedule guests for 2021? Thanks for any comments/ suggestions x"
"#169 << Do you think we are right to want to close for the forseeable >>Yes.Mainly - because of the health risks to your husband.Secondly, because the government instruction is to cease non-essential travel; your guests visiting your location is 'not' essential.Thirdly, IMO the UK will soon be put into lockdown so your guest cannot come anyway."
Your letting agent is probably working from home with virually no risk. Just checking for the commision coming in. Why would you take advice from them?Your husbands life could be at stake. If you stay open you will have a trickle of guests.
"These are strange times, you must beware of your husband's health, and that of your guests.I hope you don't have to take too much of a financial hit, but it's only money.Let's hope this unpleasantness starts to peak shortly.Be safe, everyone."
"Thank you for replying. Yes, this is exactly how we understand the situation. Unless there is some clear directive from the Govmt. in the next few days we will have to sort it ourselves.Stay well x"
"Latest advice from the government . Seems to say it all.“ Essential travel, the Department for Health and Social Care said, ""does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays”"
"In the US, small towns are finding themselves to be considered as desirable locations for folks fleeing the virus in big cities. Unfortunately, this puts a greater strain on food and other supplies, as well as potentially overwhelming small medical facilities (which will presumably have trouble coping with the full impact of the virus among the local community, let alone lots of visitors).I can't imagine any of your booked guests will be surprised if you cancel and refund their money. Maybe offer a 10% discount if they rebook for 2021/2022, to encourage them to stay with you when travel resumes."
The sites where I was entertained with camp activities are now out of bounds ...Such is such thingsAnthony K
I would not go - Reschedule the trip.
">>In the US, small towns are finding themselves to be considered as desirable locations for folks fleeing the virus in big cities.<<Here in my country there are loads and loads of summer houses/cottages and it might become a problem if many folks go stay there and rely on the services of those small municipalities."
