What is the general mood in the city right now? Is it less crowded or are people out and about as usual? How about restaurants and the usual sites? We are still planning on flying in on Saturday as of today.
Here a trip report for you from someone who is there at the moment : https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…
"Parisians are going about their business as usual. The metro and buses are all as crowded as usual depending on the time of day. Since I am not a tourist, I can't really comment on crowds at museums and monuments."
"Italy is in quarantine. The entire country. It is very likely the same will be true for France within the next two weeks. If you do whose to come, know that it may be difficult to return home and once you return, you may be asked to stay in your home for fourteen days."
"There is no 'general mood' because a lot of people remain in ignorance about the threat of the disease and the even more direct threat of the official measures that will, inevitably, be taken soon. As someone who travels frequently between London and Paris for work I took the decision some days ago to remain in London for at least the next few weeks (the epidemic is predicted to peak in May). I have the full support of my business colleagues inside and outside the company.Many, many people who travel internationally for business have suspended all but the most critical journeys. It is only the general public who appear underinformed (despite the vast amount of information available). Carrying on as if nothing has happened is currently an option, but it won't be for long."
"Ah, I was on the Champs Elysées this morning and did notice a major difference. Since I worked on the Champs Elysées for more than 30 years, I pretty much know exactly how many people are there at all times.Today the crowds were sparse, but it wasn't hard to figure out why -- no Chinese tourists. Very few ""non-Europeans"" of any kind for that matter."
"** Italy is in quarantine. The entire country. It is very likely the same will be true for France within the next two weeks **The Italian government took a responsible measures. Obviously, the safety of their population is of paramount importance. From the early on, it was obvious that they are not going to take a cavalier approach toward the deadly outbreak."
"#4. It is not a epidemic. Check the WHO.And maybe it's because the general public ARE better informed.Edited: 12:13 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Can I ask does it look like it will be hard to travel around Europe....we are coming for 7 weeks in 5 weeks time. My only concern is if we did need medical help my insurance does not cover it even though we bout it b4 this occurred. Paris is 2 weeks but we are coming from Brussels then on to Portugal then Germany and Greece
"#7 is wrong. The World Health Organisation IS calling coronavirus an epidemic, because it is. They are just not calling it a PANdemic - yet. The WHO Director General has however said that “The threat of a pandemic has become very real.” And many organisations, such as the German government ARE calling it a pandemic.For reference, “pandemic” refers to how many parts of the world are experiencing the disease, not to how deadly the disease is."
"jacks24 - today Merkel estimated 2/3s of the German population are likely to fall ill, so that may effect travel in Germany. For now, must of our borders remain open, but many airlines have already cancelled flights to Italy. Nobody knows what the situation will be five weeks from now."
"@8 start watching the situation as it unfolds....""hard"" to travel ...well sure could be as things escalate...if anyone can find an expert that thinks we have hit peak and that things are getting better please quote. You will run the risk of border closings...things closed...and at worst quarantine in Europe or upon your return. Given the time and expense involved in a trip like this why not postpone until you have a good chance of everything going as planned?"
"Thank you all. Our decision was made for us today. We are cancelled. But honestly I’m looking forward to rebooking at a time when the pandemic won’t be hanging like a dark cloud over our vacation (is 12-months from now a good target??). Hoping all our insurance pays off. Will start that process in the morning. Until then I am thankful for my health, my husband’s health. We are blessed and don’t need to go to Paris to celebrate our 20 years of marriage. I hope all of YOU stay safe and healthy and we will see you when things have calmed down!"
Great attitude Ambassador. Stay healthy!
"And you stay healthy, Phread. You have been the voice of reason, giving accurate information on the ground. I appreciate the willingness you have shown to get the facts you have access to out to concerned posters on the forum."
"Thank you, Rumplees; you, too."
"The mood in Paris is that many people talk about it, but people take the métro, work as normal, i have see only one or 2 people by métro wearing a mask, so a small minority"
"I was thinking maybe do a month in Paris instead of our 7 week trip around that we were doing the airline will allow changes but our insurance here even though bough last November doesn’t cover cancellations due to corona so we would b out of pocket $6k ....what are people’s thoughts. My main concern is being stuck if things get worse or ending up In hospital with no insurance for corona due to it now classed as an epidemic.Edited: 11:37 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"jacks. We were booked to fly out on April 2nd for ten weeks in country France. We have cancelled. The possibility of needing to be hospitalised and not being covered was just one factor. Singapore airport no longer allows passengers transiting from France and we would be doing that on the way home in June.Yes, it may all be over by then, but I do not have a crystal ball.I also did not want to catch it on planes or in airports and then take it to our gites, or conversely, bring it home with us. But the big factor for us is the pleasure we get from staying in gites in the countryside. It would just not be the same with restrictions, things closed, on edge all the time if we got a sniffle or a cough. We are going to lose several thousand dollars but it would be a lot more if we are in hospital or have to make other arrangements to get home. Every one has to make their own decisions. We have made ours. You have a couple of more weeks than we had so who knows."
Thanks phirhon I really respect your answer as it’s exactly how I have been thinking. Much appreciated
"After dancing on the volcano for a couple of weeks, Parisians have finally come down to earth after the president's speech and the closing of all schools, theatres and museums.Therefore, today there were not many people on the metro or the buses. I saw quite a few masks (or creative scarf arrangements) in outer Paris, but all of the masks disappeared in the center of the city where we daredevils go.The cinemas are still open but extremely restricted. The big UGC chain is limiting spectators to 99 for the big screens and to half capacity for the screens with less than 100 seats (for example, 70 seats means 35 maximum). Gaumont-Pathé is also restricted to 100 maximum and is closing every other row in their cinemas."
"Yes, for the first time in days, our closest Franprix in the 15eme was OUT of toilet paper. Other items were fairly well stocked. Very few people on the streets. Odd feeling.I've not been able to find rubbing alcohol for a week.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 14, 2020 "
My Leclerc supermarket at Rosa Parks has plenty.
"It was just announced today that effective midnight restaurants, cafes, bars will be closed."
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your travel insurance is not likely to pay off. Even the “cancel for any reasons” policies have an exception for cancellations due to pandemics or newly imposed government rules in regulations. It’s buried in the fine print."
"Travelling Canadians were ordered to get back home asap, before commercial flights are cancelled.Upon return - no exception there is 14 days quarantine. Entire Europe is closing.Its really better for anyone to stay home."
Why doesn't insurance cover?
Agreed
"Most travel insurance policies have a clause which excludes epidemics and pandemics. If the policy did not exclude them and you were already there when it all began, you may be covered. If you went knowing it was in progress they can then use that to not pay.Jacks, I can appreciate your pain. We have been able to salvage some, but are still out several thousand dollars. As self funded retirees watching our super fly out the window, it is difficult."
"Thanks K2. Bit far to go for rubbing alcohol. I tried 5 different shops, including 2 pharmacies. None to be found, shelves where it normally sat were empty. Interestingly, plenty of javel."
"I have my windows flung open to let in some fresh airs, and it’s very quiet out there."
"Voting in the municipal elections this morning was like being in a giant board game. They had marked out one-meter boxes on the floor with masking tape, and we advanced square by square without rolling the dice."
Thanks for response
Totally understand phiron I no someone who has made a huge loss ...mine is nothing compares to them.With the insurance policy even though I took it out before this all happened it has a teeny weeny little clause buried in it that says if it’s an epidemic or pandemic it’s not payable for cancellations. I ran them and even the hospital cover is a little dicey as they will ‘assess it when it happens’ thanks again everyone these threads are very much appreciated
"For those of us who have suffered financial losses (as have I) I recommend thinking about the unfortunate people whose losses included jobs, good health and lives. I think the citizens of the world that have had health and lives endangered would be feeling lucky to be in our shoes. I am grateful all I have lost is money."
"Agree missmarleygirly. I’m disappointed to have to cancel our trip and it won’t be great if I don’t recoup any money, but if that is the worse thing that happens to me and my family after this time has passed, I will consider myself lucky."
Rubbing alcohol at the Carrefour rue de Sevres
"LVMH perfume production facilities will switch to making sanitising gel starting tomorrow. It will be distributed for free to health authorities, which should relieve supply pressure and increase the amounts available to the public: https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Sante/Corona…"
"Thanks Phread. We are house bound now (like everyone else is supposed to be), so will have to go without rubbing alcohol. So far, still healthy. Hope we can all stay that way."
"So far, we have been very lucky. Our extensive travel plans for this and next month have all been cancelled and monies refunded. However, there are many, many people who do not have the financial depth to make if for one month with very limited funds and some possibly without a place to live. Financial hardships are ahead for business and individual alike. Macron´s earlier call for compassion and a sense of community are critical to everyone’s survival. I do not think that there is any danger of similar comments coming from the US president, individuals hopefully will step up and fill gaps, help those in need, and possibly channel some saved vacation dollars/euros to helping the less fortunate."
Amen!
"If one Google's ""panic buying + ___ city of your choice and filter for the last 24 hours you can watch plenty of Twitter videos, etc all documenting this peace and love humanity.My group hug posts have the highest delete rate of any of my posts, even over my unconscionable full moon posts lose to my group hugs delete records. But why not give it one more try..You want to know the mood here, it sucks. An entire chapter in history is gone, the hugs of friends meeting up after ages, European same genders holding hands while walking around, the French cheek kiss no matter the age, sharing anything, etc. All gone like a wish before a candle. Let's hope someone gets the memo."
"I saw what appeared to be panic buying in my local Franprix this afternoon for the first time. In the last week, there were some moments with most of the pasta depleted, but that was minor. But I walked in a while ago to pick up a few things -- nothing urgent -- but I walked right back out when I saw the line of 40 people waiting for the checkout stands (which were all open -- something else I have never seen there). It is not a huge Franprix, and the queue was snaking all around the store."
"Our fairly large Franprix was cleared out of most fresh veggies yesterday and there was no toilet tissue or paper towels, among other things and yes, lots and lots of people lined up to pay. We had just stopped in for some fresh tomatoes, none to be had, we left.On our way home passed our favorite Primeur and he had a sign on his metal volet that said due due the virus, they will be closed until the situation improves for the safety of employees and clients.Stayed in today as we're trying to stay in as much as possible. So, I have no idea what the neighborhood looked like today."
"Bloomberg today's proposal: European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen proposed a temporary halt to non-essential travel to the European Union for 30 days, in an effort to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus.Von der Leyen informed leaders of the Group of Seven advanced industrial economies about the ban during a conference call on Monday. The restrictions, which are subject to approval by EU leaders, can be prolonged “as necessary” after the initial 30-day period, she said on Twitter."
"Deleting duplicate post. TA or my computer acting odd today.Edited: 11:56 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Maybe it has Coronavirus, traveler :)"
C'est la coronapanic!!!In some areas people start rebelling against the police and looting the supermarkets!
"Stop the BS, GW. Yesterday a band of young thieves tried to run out of a Carrefour Market with 2000 euros worth of groceries and miscellaneous crap -- anything they could put their hands on. They were arrested and 7 of the 8 shopping carts were recovered with all of the merchandise.If this is your idea of a ""rebellion"" rather than common robbery for profit, we have clearly received different educations."
I wasn't thinking about that when I said rebellion but about other distinct incidents in Paris.
"Well then you should give us all of the details. You must have a private source of news because apart from stupid people walking around for no reason, I have not seen much information about ""rebellion.""Which supermarkets were looted? Some of us will check what you tell us.Edited: 11:16 am, March 18, 2020 "
Thank you k2. The situation is bad enough on its own. Spreading unsubstantiated rumors will do nothing other than increase people's anxiety and increase panic. Shame on anyone who does this.
"Looted supermarkets:- The Auchan you mentionned- Coccinelle Express, Trappes (78)- Carrefour Market in Mezieres sur Seine (94)- E. Leclerc in Viry Chatillon (91) only a fight, no looting in that oneRebellion in Paris:https://actu.fr/ile-de-france/paris_75056/vi…"
"(General Mood is a colleague of mine and a very good friend, so you can trust me)"
"The store I mentioned was a Carrefour Market, not an Auchan. You should at least troll with more precision.As for the link, just about all of the photos are from rue Dejean at Château Rouge. About half of the people there don't even speak French, so it is not too surprising that they were not respecting the rules on the very first day.Edited: 12:46 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Regardless of which market, what is the point in posting this General-Waste? Does it serve any purpose other than to feed your need for connectivity and to whip up people's panic and anxiety? It certainly is not helpful to anyone reading this forum. Stop. We need to support each other, not create anxiety for each other. Jeeze. Some people.Edited: 2:11 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Miss Marley dear, the topic here is ""General mood in Paris right now"", not ""cheer up, people, spring is coming!"". So I posted informations about the general mood in Paris right now. And a neologism that seems appropriate: coronapanic!!!"
"Whatever floats your boat, dear."
Paris tonight. People are supposed to make noise at 8pm to support our health professionals.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3357feOgmw
If people want to support the health professionnals they can easily do that by staying home and not be another case they will have to take care of on top of all the others.
"Well, these people were all at home and not exposing themselves to the virus."
"#61 Well said, Soph."
"Not sure silence is an effective way to communicate solidarity - especially in the French cultural context. The clips of streets of Italians (in their apartments!) singing together and exercising together tells a reassuring story.Edited: 12:42 am, March 19, 2020 "

"I heard a lot of appreciation last night at 20h00. People clapping their hands from their windows, from their balconies, in appreciation of what health care professionals have done."
Thanks for sharing - that's great to hear. Hope someone you-tubed it so it can be shared with the health professionals!
