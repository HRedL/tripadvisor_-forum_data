I'm supposed to go to cancun Friday. I'm cancelling. Of course the people at hotels are going to tell you everything is ok. not worth dying to me. i'll go back when this fiasco is long gone. Russian roulette 
"Before you cancel, get the facts first. Read similar posts in this forum and the Playa del Carmen forum."
"I don't care what they say, i'm not taking any chances. there's plenty of places to go besides cancun."
"But there could well be an epidemic in New York if the tests on 27 New York students prove positive. Isn't ""North Jersey"" nearer to New York than Cancun is to any infected area?"
"vmctrader,I'm sure you have done your homework.If you would like further information about the recent flu outbreak:World Health Organizationhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_24/en/Center For Disease Controlhttp://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htmPeace!"

They got it by going to mexico

"No, There having a HBO Boxing fight televised tonight in Cozumel and all is fine. I would be the first to tell you if something was wrong. "
I'm just the opposite of vmtrader. We booked a last minute trip to Cancun next weekend because we could get such a smokin deal on airfare and hotel. I figure it's more dangerous to ride in a Mexican taxi. It'll be an adventure. I don't let a few folks dying to get in the way of fun in the sun. Anyway there are antivirals that work on the swine flu. 
Genious
"""It is unclear if the eight students who tested positive were among the group that spent spring break in Cancun."""
"vmc, you probably joined yesterday to tell us that you are canceling your trip. If your trip was factual then do whatever you wish.I am making plans to go there as soon as I can get my ducks in a row. Those pesky ducks sometimes will not cooperate."
"It's spelled ""Genius"".... I like how the connection between kids in Queens going to Cancun and kids in Queens getting sick somehow become the same kids. There not even connected!Leave it to American news media to instill a very healthy dose of fear in you. You can find better information and facts about YOUR OWN COUNTRY by reading other country's news, (i.e. BBC) rather than fear and ratings driven news pieces coming from CNN, FOX, and MSNBC.I'm supposed to go to Mexico in June for my honeymoon, and I'm not an advocate one way or another. Of course I want to be safe, but I'm not going to start listening CNN, who tells me that I need to stay inside and lock my doors because 20 people in THE ENTIRE US got sick. Another thing, if Cancun is your idea of Mexico City or Mexico as a whole, than you ARE a ""geniOus!"""
"There are roughly 20 cases of confirmed swine flu incidents in the entire US. That is all. Nobody is dead, and most have totally recovered. Others are still suffering symptoms of the flu, but will live normal lives being victims of a normal flu. Further to all this this is nothing but something that the US is seriously watching. Nothing more then that. So go travel and have fun in Cancun."
would'nt it be good if all the drugs cartels got swine flu then we would not have to worry about them any more see you in 3 weeks if you think i'm going to cancel now you must be jocking just bring plenty of tissues
im with u bigmart! 3 weeks on fri!
"I agree, I changed my tickets to the Caribbean instead. Going to the Dominican Republic north coast, fewer tourists there and there are private villas available to avoid resorts full of people. If this flu does not stop it will soon become a nightmare."
I see you're from Colorado Springs. I'm from just up the road from you in Castle Rock. If you get those ducks in a row for this weekend 5-2 through Cinco de Mayo We'll be staying at the Westin. 
Cknitter you're hilarious. Goin in June as well - there is no need to panic yet! 
"I am def going in May cant wait, will show you how the guys from London party."
world traveler what will you do if swine flu shows up in the Dominican Republic? You will cancel that trip too? Just go to Cancun where there is no evidence of the flu.
"Hmmm did anyone remember President Obama visted Mexico a few weeks ago?? I wonder how he is feeling??I was in Cancun the week of April 11th -18th, and i am fine. if the kids from NY got sick coming back home, and they were like the kids staying at my resort it was probably from alcohol withdrawl!! LOL!!"
"I wouldn't worry as much about getting sick, it is only a flu and days of rest one can recuperate.But what happens whilst in Mexico if you get sick, afterall it only takes about 4 days from time of exposure. Will the airlines let you on the plane? Bet not and this is more worrisome.In summary, bring extra cash as a just in case and hand sanitizer."
"I am due to fly out to Cancun next Tuesday, really dont know what to do, at the moment the foriegn office are still saying we can fly, but when we get there are we gonna be worried to go out of the resort?? If we cancel we lose everything, cant afford to lose £4000, travel agents said travel insurance wont cover us as its an act of nature!!!!So we just have to sit and wait. Hopefully if we do go we will have the Tamiflu at hand!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Interesting thread from the Cabo forum... Google Map~tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g152515-i84-k27418…
"Im suppose to be going to cancun on may 15th and im thinking about cancelling aswell. Although its mainly mexico city, there have been cases of students returning from cancun on spring break who have tested positive. i was going for my 21st and im not taking the risk."
"I'm going to Akumel on May 15. I'm a little concerned but the rest of my household is not. We are definatly going. This could just be that anyone who has been in Mexico in the last month and has a cold is immediatly quarantined. All that does is cause panic in people who are at no risk. I always feel a little ill coming back from the Caribbean but thats to do with the change in climate and 10 hours on a plane. Does that mean I'll be quarantined too? Until the WHO sais don't go, I'm going"
I would be curious to see what Percentage of kids coming back got sick VS the actual percentage of people who have been down there in the past month?No one i met in Cancun has gotten sick!!
"Hey I'm all for people cancelling their reservations. It increases the chance of upgrades, better service and attention from the staff, and my choice of chairs at the beach and pools! "
Going end of May and again and cant wait. While I appreciate there is a small risk of picking swine flu up (I went to Gambia at Xmas and had the same risk with Malaria !!) I think a lot of this is stirred up by the media - lets face it its great news aint it ??? Scaremongering !! Just like the credit crunch - all exagerated by the press and hypes everyone up !!!  You could walk out your door tomorrow and get run over by a bus . 10 million people in Mexico -whats the odds on YOU catching swine flu ???  If in doubt keep out of the nightclubs - stay out in the fresh air !!!
A 9 yr old boy has a confirmed case of Swine flu in Lorain County Ohio. Thankfully he appears to be fighting off the infection quite well but he is quarantined. His parent's have not shown symptoms yet.
We are due to fly to Cancun on May 15th as well. I think we'll probably go unless the airport or resort closes or is quarantined in the meantime. Our trip was purchased months ago...
I and 6 members of my family are leaving for Cancun Saturday May 2nd. We are NOT worried. A guy here in Kansas City got hit by lightning and killed riding a motorcycle over the weekend. Stuff happens. I'm going and having fun. Ray
"Ray,Yeah stuff happens but some stuff is preventable.Have a great trip and wash your hands."
"I was in Cancun for 11 nights, March 19-30. Came back and one week later got the worst cold I've ever had in my life. Sicker than a dog for about 3-4 days. As of last week, I still couldn't leave the house without a box of Kleenex. Now, three weeks after I've gotten sick, am finally feeling better. Hubby got sick the week after me. Just figured I picked up a really nasty virus, which maybe I did and had nothing to do with going to Mexico. Or maybe it was swine flu. At this point, since I'm pretty much over it, I probably won't know. That being said, if I could afford to go back tomorrow, I would do it in a heartbeat. "
I have get a chuckle out of people switching to DR to avoid illness. There is always a risk of illness in the Dominican due to its close proximity to Haiti. I am also scheduled for Mexico on May 10th and have some concern only because I am taking 2 teens and a 7 year old. Still thinking about it and weighing the risk. Airlines are now allowing reschedules but not true for the resorts. I guess its a waiting game.
I am going to Cancun May 16th and am still planning on going. I don't think we can stop the flu. It's going to affect whoever wherever and whenever it wants so i'm not cancelling my trip because of it.
I agree we are going may 16th and I'm not cancelling our trip unless they cancel it in which case we get our money back. We purchased it way back in February.
"I am currently staying at the Excellence Riviera Cancun and we have not been advised of any problems by either the hotel or our travel rep. However, reports in the UK press seem to alarm our relatives at home more than us. Maybe we are being naive but the authorities have not issued any alerts and countries around the world have not closed their borders with Mexico or, cancelled flights to and from Mexico. Indeed, another Thomas Cook flight came in last night delivering more tourists. I just hope that the warnings, although justified, pass as quickly as those for Avain Flu a few years backOh yes, there have been no incidences of Swine Flu in Quintana Roo *Yucatan peninsular*."
"The same thought is going through my mind at the moment, I booked my Holiday way back in January and although im not due to fly out until the end of June I'm a little worried that the travel agents that i booked with will cancel it."
"worldtravel848 --friends of mine just returned from Dominican, with food poisoning, parasites, diahhrea, etc., hope you aren't affected with any of that stuff!"
"I think my friends and family are more upset about the photos of me lounging on the beach that I'm sending home than the flu. If it helps them feel better that they're not enjoying the sun in Cancun, that's ok with me."
"Six of us going on May 16th-we're all in our sixties, so of course we took out insurance and can cancel one day prior. I'm a nurse and will watch closely, and probably bring us all masks to wear on plane. Not so worried about the resort. I'll go unless they put a ban on travel. "
"To allvcmtrader IS NOT A REAL poster. His Join date is April 25 same day as his post. Also worldtravel848 is most likely vmctrader. Same join date, no other posts other than on flu threads, same type of decision making as in ""I'm cancelling the trip no questions asked"". vcmctrader=worldtravel848=an internet troll"
"You all do what you want,everyone refunded me all my money from Continental to the Ritz Carlton. My health is worth alot more than 4 days in Cancun. We'll go back when this is all over. To all you idiots, enjoy laying on the beach with a mask on and wondering who sneezed,coughed on you and your food all week."
Were heading to Playa del Carmen in two weeks. I haven't heard about any outbreaks in the Yucatan Peninsula. Does anyone know more about this? And should I cancel this trip? 
vmctrader you are a troll. Your only reason for joining was to stir stuff up.
hmmmm......the RC doesn't charge you until 3 days prior to your arrival - so a refund would not be necessary at this point....
"I cant find any of those cool masks, I will just use my wifes bathing suit bottom as a mask. Or actually we could use her bikini top and for the both of us. Wait, now i am going to start a business of decorative masks with a beach theme on them. I will make millions, does anyone have Billy Mays cell phone number?? "
dosxxs - I know you are taking this lightly - which is fine - but some of us unfortunately have different circumstances - for instance - I'm having to find a different destination for our anniversary trip now. Not much stops me from MX - this will be our 3rd trip this year - but DH has a low immune system because of medication. (You'd never guess that by looking at him) but that's just it - you never know what situation people are experiencing. It would not be wise for us to put him in that environment when I know I can prevent it. I just hope this is all worked out before another trip this summer we have planned! But for our trip in 2 weeks - it's a bummer.
"But this Swine Flu is common in USA, not Cancun. Due to your husbands condition I would think you would not only want to cancel your trip, but that you would not want to go anywhere with a lot of people in TEXAS. I get asked a million questions for wanting to give blood each year because I take a trip to CANCUN. There are things you can catch in any tropical place outside of the USA, just add this to the list. Actually I could get bit by a misquito in my backyard here in Texas and catch malaria, or whatever. I just think this is a like someone yelling FIRE in a crowded theater when someone lites up a match and then people getting stomped to death as everyone runs for the doors. The media wants and needs a story, this is the Natalie Holoway or O.J. Simpson news story of the time. "
"Your right. everything is fine and dandy, enjoy your trip"
The kids in Queens DID go to Cancun! That's how they got sick! I don't know how you are saying it is unrelated!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Crazy to take a chance with this international warning going on! Hey--if you want to risk your life...go for it! 
"""The United States will issue a travel advisory urging Americans to avoid all 'non-essential' travel to Mexico out of concern for the swine flu outbreak.""foxnews.com/politics/…Yes, people can be exposed here in the U.S.. In that unfortunate event, they could be treated by their own doctor and hospital, covered by their regular insurance, if they have it, and not quarantined from their home country."
"You have to make a responsible decision. I canceled my trip to Cancun, not because there is an epidemic there, but the flight alone is an unnecessary exposure risk. If you come into contact with young, elderly, or sick people, you should consider the risk to them on your return."
"jenn2931 'the kids in New York were in Cancun, but by way of Mexico City, which is the problem. Not sure a direct flight to Cancun from the States would present a problem, but if your plane goes by way of Mexico City, which the New York kids did, then I'd worry."
"I agree with cknitter. My husband and I are going to Cancun this weekend for 4 days. We talked about maybe canceling but realized that YES - only like 40 people in the US have this flu and no one in the US has died from it. That's like .000000000001%.The media is notorious for dictating the world, scaring people, even swaying us on how to vote. They are certainly not going to keep me from going on our little 4 day vacation. vmctrader - think it over before you cancel. Don't let the media run your life."
worldtravel848 Don't forget your Malaria medicine! 
Am hoping the strong U.S. dollar will lessen the severity of the swine flu for U.S. citizens.
"Seriously...There are 40,000 deaths by car every year in the U.S., that's 109 every day. There have been 140 deaths from Swine flu in almost a month in Mexico. You're more likely to die tomorrow on your way to work than you are in Cancun. Also, the distance from Mexico City (where the Swine Flu actually is) and Cancun is over 800 miles. That's like saying there's the flu in L.A. and worrying about catching it in Portland, OR. Mexico is a country. Don't buy into the media."
"Ok everyone going at the end of May and are worried about the flu, please stay home so I can get a lounge chair at the pool!!. When I was in college our travel class went to Puerta Vallarta and when we came back all 75 of us were quarantined for typhoid!! Did anyone of us get it? Well of course not. Did it make the papers? Well of course it did! I am going to sit tight and wait for some other world news evernt to happen, so the media has something else to panick everyone about!!!!!"
I also am from Littleton and we are going on 4/30/09 we will be at the RoyalCancun until 5/6
You should be more worried about hanging out in the cafeterias in New New jersey wondering if the employee washed there hands after wiping there butt and preparing your food
We just got back from Cancun on the 11th of April with 10 families. Approximately 12 out of the 32 people in our group got sick to verying degrees. My daughter was sick for 2 weeks and still has lingering effects. She went to her doctor several times to run tests for mono etc.. Word had not gone out yet about the swine flu epidemic. We believe that is what most of the people had. We stayed at the Moon Palace.
"WHO reports 26 CONFIRMED cases of Swine Flu in Mexico, less than the 40 in the USA. Also one in Spain, more than in Cancun.Also recommends against any travel restrictions.www.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_27/en/index.htmlStill no cases of Swine Flu in Cancunmaps.google.com/maps/ms…"
"My husband and I have gone back and forth and we decided to only listen to CDC, WHO and our travel agent. The media has this all hyped up beyond what it is- 40 cases in the US - lets say they all orginated in Mexico - thats less than 1/2 of one flight - Delta alone has 8 flights in and out of Mexico today. ""Mexico"" is a big place, just like the drug cartel hype - it was no where near Cancun. Now flu virus could very well make its way to Cancun via travelers coming thru Mexico City - but it sounds like it could come to your home town as well. To say all travel stops is kind of crazy to as there have all ready been thousands there and back and thousands there now. ITs just like kids passing chicken pox at school, it comes and it goes. We leave on the 9th and unless we are told we can not go we will be there! My husbands theory is drink plenty of alchol to kill off any viruses or bacteria we may come in contact with. LOL"
I agree...how many people have returned with Mexico absolutely fine? Sounds like more than have gotten sick.
