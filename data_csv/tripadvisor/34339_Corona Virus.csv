"I'm a news junkie(Surprised, my guess is not) been watching the news about the Corona virus from the very beginning.Has the outbreak of the corona virus given any pause to your travel plans especially ones to Hawaii, yet?Not do to the virus, but we moved our September visit to late October. Now making sure that anything I book can be cancelled. My hope is they contain the outbreak quickly can't imagine what people are going through in those Chinese cities under lock down."
Nope....no pause at all
"We’ve added outward facing spikes to the walls surrounding the plumeria farm. I’ve ordered a thermal body scanner for the gate. I’m not sure when it will be arriving, and I’ve heard that the infected are contagious before they’re showing symptoms, so probably we need some sort of quarantine area for the incubation period. I’ve told Mrs. Sunny we need a bigger shotgun, but she thinks the spikes are enough of a deterrent and any desperate tourists will be more likely to prey upon the newly installed refrigerator in my neighbor’s tiny house."
"Thinking the same thing, Fireball. Booked in May for Oahu - and maybe Maui. From what I am picking up on the news ... reactions/precautions internationally have been swift and thorough. And the advice given to Americans publicly (National news last night) is what your mom would advise ... a flu shot and wash your hands. I had have annual flu shots since I was a puppy. I'm a walking flu shot. But yes, Hawaii is an ""International Gateway.""Interested to hear from Jet and other locals ...Edited: 12:47 pm, January 27, 2020 "
https:/…nCOV2019.aspxFrom one of my former employers ...
I'm not anymore concerned being in Hawaii then I would be on the mainland. After all the first case in the USA was in Washington state. I just bought round trip tickets for hubby and I to Colorado in May and round trip tickets to bring 4 granddaughters here in mid June. Insured them all. I tend not to worry about things that I can't control especially in the future. When or if it becomes time to take some kind of action or worry I'll do it then!!
"I am following along with the corona story. This trip we added trip insurance. I’ll probably do that from now on. But to answer your question, I would still hop a plane to Maui."
I’m more concerned with the long plane ride in close proximity to people than the actual trip.
"Spent 5 days on Maui and never really thought about it. Just flew Maui to San Fransisco. We are sitting at a gate now, waiting for connection to Portland. On walk in between gates we've seen about a dozen travelers with face masks."
"We're on Maui now and don't leave for another week. Reading about the surgical masks, and with coronaviruses being so small, it probably will pass through...... or if it doesn't it will build up on the mask and put you in greater danger when you remove it. Sooooo, just going to be vigilant with the sanitation and hope to get through HNL and Houston uninfected."
Does travel insurance cover disease outbreak? Not seeing it in my policy.
#12 it depends on the policy you purchased. Call the 800 number to find out.
"I guess I'm thinking if the virus gets to a point of very high concern, the airlines will start issuing travel waivers. Then you wouldnt need insurance, yes? Because of my recent situation I posted about, I did some checking about travel insurance. The reasons listed for canceling are quite extreme, but not unreasonable. Can't just cancel because of a small problem. I get it. All that aside, what's the deal with waivers issued by the airlines, due to health/sickness out breaks?"
"The airlines have been issuing waivers for travel to China for a few weeks, and United announced today that it is suspending flights to and from China starting next week."

"It's being reported that the death toll has jumped to 132, that's not good."
"We're leaving in a few hours now. We've all had flu shots but my Husband picked up a box of face masks (so we will be one of those families on the plane) as well as saline nasal spray too.  I always wipe down our seating area with clorox wipes and Lysol spray. I swear his ""concern"" is now making me a little concerned."
"Vickie, go enjoy your trip. It will be fine. I look forward to reading your trip report once you get home."
HulaHoney73....Thanks :)
"“Should I wear a facemask during flu season or while on a plane?” The short answer to this question is probably, “No.” For most people, covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing, and frequent hand washing—with warm water and soap, or alcohol-based handI believe more people die in the US annually from just the regular flu"
"""I believe more people die in the US annually from just the regular flu""Right, because influenza has been around for a long time and there are very good mortality statistics available.2019 novel coronavirus is a new virus so the statistics are emerging along with the disease.By shear numbers, influenza does result in a lot of deaths annually with the typical mortality rate being 0.1% depending on the strain.One exception is the 1918 flu pandemic that had a mortality rate of 2.5%...same as the current coronavirus.Good news is we have at our disposal 21st century surveillance methods and world class public health entities."
What I’m reading on the CDC site is the flu kills a lot more than the Coronavirus. I wash my hands a lot and hope for the best. We generally travel to Hawaii in January. And so far so good.
"I am concerned about the long plane ride too to Maui. Also going into the swimming pool at the four seasons resort. I guess that I am concerned about the incidental contact with people along the way. I have planned this trip since last spring so hate to be chicken little and cancel it. My trip is in May.Edited: 9:24 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"This thread had died off.....but there are several others which are active and have lots of info.Without knowing where you are from, you may already have been exposed to COVID-19. You might get flu or something else.......or nothing at all.Yes-the mortality rate is higher than the flu. That may change as more cases are counted and the fatalities drop compared to cases reported.If you are generally healthy, and don't have any immune system issues, you are likely fine. If you have any medical issues or immune system issues you should talk to your doctors.We have still not had ANY confirmed cases on Maui or in Hawaii."
"I have been monitoring the virus closely one of the unanswered questions is how warmer weather will affect the virus. Will it be like the flu which normally tappers off as temperatures rise or will it be a 12 month virus. With your trip coming in May it should give you enough time to determine if the virus is growing or is under control. New case reporting is declining at this time, so hopefully that continues. I suggest staying informed and be patient"

"Just like SARS and MERSA which yes, still happen globally, the sensationalism around this will die off. The media loves hyping this stuff up, twisting information to make money off our clicks. Here in our first world country, just be smart like you would be to avoid sickness any other time you fly, go on vacation, etc. Unless you're at ground zero in China don't worry and enjoy yourself."
"Actually, AmyNoelle, MRSA (not MERSA) is rather terrifying. Anyone who works in healthcare can attest to this. It is basically superbugs that have evolved to be resistant to readily available antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus is more and more prevalent because of an over prescribing of antibiotics and people not finishing the course that was prescribed to them. As someone who deals with this everyday, I would just say, wash your hands, and cover your mouth when you cough please!Edited: 11:38 am, February 19, 2020 "
"I forgot the most important part, don’t stop taking your antibiotics just because you feel better. Take them all!"
"Amynoelle that is just ignorantGo ahead and report me. Your post is fake news.Edited: 2:10 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"What I posted in #25 still applies......but as many of us expected, the US is now expected to get cases like most places.........but in what areas and how severe an outbreak remains to be seen.Check CNN or the NY Times if you want to read details from the CDC.I still feel safer here on Maui than I would in most places of the US, but others may not :-)."
Trump just asked for 2.5 billion Nancy of course said that's to much. Oh wait Nancy's medical field donors just got a hold of her. Now Nancy says Trumps an idiot for only asking for 2.5 billion. Hawaii is behind the curve on getting those federal dollars. Someone one on Maui should claim they're close to a cure. Any ideas on who that should be?
"I think Sunny and Kaeleku should publish their secret vaccine :-)!No one--anywhere--knows when or where the money will go, if it even gets given out. Lots of talk---and action remains to be seen. Some funds are supposedly going to disadvantaged areas outside the US.Since Hawaii has no cases, no deaths, or even serious illnesses--we will be way down the list anyway. We have no one in mandatory quarantine and to date, only one man---yes, *one* was ever in mandatory quarantine. So we look darn safe and healthy compared to many states.Edited: 3:45 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"I think she meant MERS, camel flu."
"Fake news? Well this article echos my sentiment about this virus' severity, unless you think a medical director for a hospital's communicable diseases unit is fake also.If you think the media doesn't use buzz words (like pandemic) to sell stories than I don't think you understand the media. They may be reporting facts, but if you don't see how people will spin facts to sell you something I don't know what to say.""While the global death toll has so far topped 2,700, it's good to remember that more than 80% of the Covid-19 cases have been mild, requiring little to no medical intervention, and it is much less deadly than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which are also coronaviruses.""Yeah, you don't hear about the 80% because that doesn't sell stories.And yes, I meant MERS. Spell check got me."
"Amy is correct a lot of fake news on the coronavirus. Like the death rate percentage is much higher with Corona then the flu. It's marginally higher plus they're just getting around with how to treat it properly, plus they're able to identify it earlier so treatment can start earlier. Death rate will fall."
"I love how whenever Grate Leedur speaks Fireball's tune immediately changes. Apparently Grate Leedur and Rush think COVID-19 and the flu are the same (nobody else does) so now Fireball does too. You are right about one thing, China is figuring out how to address this, and their death tolls will trend lower. And here are the draconian, coordinated, centralized steps that China took in the most pervasive surveillance state in history to try to stop this virus: Identified the virus early. Had a plan. Implemented internal travel restrictions; built 1000-bed hospitals in a week and brought in many mobile field hospitals; drafted medical workers etc. Utilized artificial intelligence and big data analysis of their (centralized) medical records and social media posts (including literally analyzing social media images to see who wasn't wearing masks); massive quarantines. Tens of thousands of tests. And only through months of that coordinated, concerted activity were they able to slow the spread, but they haven't been able to stop it.Compare and contrast to the ""best country on Earth with the bestest most amazingest health care and the best economy in human history."" Key CDC and NSC positions cut or left unfilled for years. Months of hair on fire warnings from scientists and yet we still can't even test for COVID because there are no test kits. A religious zealot was just put in charge of the response, surprising Trump's own HHS secretary. The response is in disarray. I'm sure you are right fireball. USA USA. We will have this under control in a week.For the people talking about why is the media calling it a pandemic. Because that is the definition of a pandemic. A disease, spreading through the community on its own, in multiple countries.For the people smugly proclaiming that COVID has ""only"" killed a couple thousand. Yep, you are right. Only a couple thousand have died in a disease that has basically been thus far been limited to one province in China for three months, but has now spread across the world. COVID is coming to your town, there is nothing that can stop it."
"Kaeleku it's ""Fearless Leedur"" when he speaks I obey!"
"And as expected.......that same sad excuse of a lieder has now proclaimed that ALL info to be released about COVID will have to go to Pence first...which means to trump.Welcome to censorship, Comrade. He and his minions will make China and Iran look positively transparent."
AND I forgot to link the article....vacation brain!https:/…index.html
"Deleting my posts doesn't change the facts. It does prove that some people prefer censorship to truth though.Since trump decreed that ALL info about COVID-19 will go through pence (and of course, him)........people who think they will get the whole truth are crazy.Pray for a free media, people-because that is the only thing left that will give you multiple sources and escape the brainwashing censorship. What info you choose to believe is then at least yours by choice--not dictate of the Supreme Lieder.Edited: 10:21 am, February 28, 2020 "
"No argument that it's a pandemic. Think about the buzz around our last pandemic and then the outcome.The word pandemic as stated factually does not need to incite fear and anxiety as the article I now remembered to link shows. Stated as OH MY GOD ITS A PANDEMIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the way the media does? Very different.No smugness here over the deaths. My heart goes out to all the victims and those trapped in places due to travel restrictions. But unless you're in one of those places, I'm just saying you make want to look at facts on illness and deaths. Because there are much worse things going on currently on which to focus your anxiety. But again, the regular old flu just isn't selling clicks these days."
"The State has announced that they will start testing people next week. They have figured out a way to use the *defective kits*......don't kill me, I'm just the messenger.....For those who are not aware, the CDC did change testing criteria after the backlash over the woman from northern California's case came out. Now you don't have to have traveled to a known area or had close contact (which was the case before for ALL tests, in ALL states).People are also starting to hoard. When the CDC said to start preparing...Hawaii said like for hurricanes. So people are buying 2 weeks worth of supplies, or more. Rice, Toilet Paper, water, Vienna Sausage, Spam, Shoyu, and many other local items will be in short supply off and on for a while now..............."
I just called my stock broker told him to buy Spam and Vienna Sausage stock. IMMEDIATELY!
Shout out to Kaeleku for providing the inspiration for my new avatar. Fearless Leader is one of my all time favorites. My last one Elfo was a little to hip for the room. Please visit Disenchanted on Netflix to get up to speed.Thank You and Yes cadie I'm cocktailing!
"Fireball just want to say your “fearless leader” is waaaay cooler.This seemed like a topic kinda far away from the ho hum of “Winterpeg”. And then they announced (breaking news 5 hrs ago) they had to remove a woman from a plane here at our airport. Full hazmat. She qualifies to be tested for Covid19 as she came down with symptoms on the plane from Vancouver. Recently visited China. While it could* be any flu or illness, feels a whole lot more real for me today. Thinking of this poor woman but the fear that perhaps the whole plane load of people experienced... So I guess this will be everywhere faster than many of us can imagineEdited: 11:21 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"I like your new avatar, as I said in another forum :-).Not sure why my stalkers deleted me.....esp in # 45........what an ironic post number to have deleted........It's too bad my hate clickers are back in force. This reminds me of when they were deleting info about hurricanes a couple of years ago. So sad and such small minds.Disney--it does make it real, doesn't it? But hey, if I post something like that, I get deleted. Can't have the truth, ya' know. It's all unicorns and rainbows on Maui, right????SW"
"SW, Maui is all rainbows and unicorns until the GREEDY man in front of you at Leoda’s buys all 3 of the remaining pineapple pies!"
