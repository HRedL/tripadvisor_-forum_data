"Is it safe to travel to NYC right now, and attend Broadway shows considering the current situation?"
"Try reading some of the other coronavirus threads and asking there.Here is one all about broadway https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763…Edited: 10:06 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"With the way things are going, I wouldn't be surprised to see Broadway shows shut down soon. I know officials really don't want to close the theaters but at this rate... I have a Broadway weekend planned for mid April but I'm not booking anything that can't be cancelled."
Is it safe to attend an event in Asheville with 1000 other people?NYC is no different from anywhere else
"No offense Northern, but to a lot of Americans NY -is- different. A lot of Americans are being told right now that Corona is a danger only in NY, CA and WA. So it may be fine to get together in Asheville or Alabama."
">>>. A lot of Americans are being told right now that Corona is a danger only in NY, CA and WA<<<I had not heard that. My kid goes to college in Vermont which has TWO cases in the whole state. Her spring break has been extended by 2 days and school will resume with online courses only. Many other colleges in NY and New England are doing similar things. I have also heard of it happening in schools nationwide. Harvard says students must move out of dorms by this weekend. Not all colleges are taking it that far.Scary times.Edited: 8:50 am, March 12, 2020 "
Agreed. this thing is everywhere or will be in a matter of days.
"Mike Pence was just saying on the Today Show that it is only a problem in three states, Washington, New York and California. He is the Vice President of the United States.https:/…1238064671095173120"
God help us.
The remark of Pence is stupid and a sign of misplaced arrogance. In the end it will be a problem in all states. And when I (being a European citizen) see Trump critisizing Europe I wonder if Pence and Trump aren't underestimating the situation themselves. So many people in the US can't afford health care and probably won't be tested because of that or refuse to seek help.
Not my vice president!Poppa
"To the OP: Note that according to the NY Times website some sort of talks between the City and Broadway are taking place, with a view to lessening COVID19 risk at Bway shows. I have no idea what is being discussed, but something to keep in mind/follow."
WHO says this is a worldwide pandemic - and if there is none in your town now it just means the patients have not been found yet - likely due to the lack of test kits. IMHO it is not safe to attend any large public gatherings where you will be in contact with a number of people for many hours. The chance that none of these people are infected is next to nil.
"this is well beyond the title of ""scare"" and Broadway is dark now."
"Unfortunately Broadway has gone dark along with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Metropolitan Opera and I just saw the Frick is going dark,too. It’s been a bad day as sports venues are suspending activities everywhere."
Playbill just stated that Broadway will be dark until April 13th at the earliest. I believe those who have purchased tickets for shows prior to that date will get full refunds.
