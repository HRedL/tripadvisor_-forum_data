"Hey all!Just wanted to let you know and not to scare you but Dengue fever is present in Thailand. 5 days after we came back last month, both my partner and I ended up in the emergency dept here in perth very sick, and we were very sick for 2 weeks, turns out we had dengue fever. The only protection against it, as there are no vaccines, is using the repellant called - RID- as it has the ingredient Deet which is the only one that will protect you. You can get it from pharmacys and its in a maroon bottle. Make sure u wear it every day and night and you should be right!Thanks Caity"
"Hi Caity, there have been a few forum members who have been a victim of dengue fever in the past few months, hope you guys are feeling a little more human now. Having lived in Nth Qld, I have used RID for well over 10 years. I think there are other repellents that use DEET, but it needs to be a certain % to be more effective, although I can't remember what that is. I know a search would bring it up, but maybe someone can enlighten to this as well.Lee"
"Yes, others have DEET, available from your chemist. didn't know Rid had DEET. From memory, it's the daytime skeeter that gives you dengue. And you have to wash that DEET stuff off daily as it's toxic."
"Increasing the DEET percentage only makes the repellant last longer for each application, it has no effect on the strength of the repellant action. DEET is not toxic. And, yes, dengue fever carrying mosquitoes bite during the daytime. DEET-based repellants are available everywhere in Thailand. Sketolene (green label) is the most common."
Hi Caity and thanks for the post. Can I ask what your symptoms were? 
"I woke in the middle of the night with a very high fever and the chills, my muscles were in agony and I could barely move! Nothing could get my temp down. I was very nauseas and dry reaching. My skin was very itchy and I broke out in a rash with athritic type pains shooting up my arms and legs. I also had an intesnse headache right between the eyes. It is the most awful thing that has happened to me and I didnt know how I was going to make it through each day! Glad it is over...I am going back to Thailand in 8 weeks, people say im crazy! No way! "
"Hi Caity,I can't believe this happened to you.Wow can't believe you are going back in 8 weeks. Where abouts are you going? You must be addicted like me but i wish i could get back t hat quick, you lucky thing!I will have to try Rid, i'm allergic to something in Aeroguard and come out in a rash so i just used OFF! however it wasn't very strong.Hope your feeling better x"
"im going to phuket next week and another great product is bushman personal insect repellent with 40% deet heavy duty. its in a spray can of 130g its a yellowish can with red lid its made in cairns australia, i got my can for under $10 at priceline pharmacy in adelaide, ill be sure to be using it every day im away....hope ur 100% better caity..."
Thanks all for your well wishes! Apparantly it stay in your system for 3 months however I am now immune to one of the four strains. :)
"""I am now immune to one of the four strains.""I was told by a physician here on Phuket after I had recovered from Dengue: you are now immune to this strain for about one year."
"Hello!So scary, but when I come to Thailand Koh Samui in december is there less chance to get dengue fever than in musoon period? European media is describing situation in Thailand now as epidemic.(Sorry my english)."
I also got dengue in Thailand (Kaya beach) in May. I was pretty ill for about three weeks and quite tired for another three weeks.I have now fortunately totally recovered and will be going to Thailand again in a forthnight! (using repellents with a generous hand..)
"MrCycling, dengue-carrying mosquitoes bite during the daytime."
can you buy rid in Patong or would it be better for us to take it with us?
