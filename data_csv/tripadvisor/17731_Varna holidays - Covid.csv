"Hi,Can anyone living in Bulgaria let me know what's going on in Bulgaria recently covid cases seem to increase rapidly last days. I booked flights from Cyprus to Varna on August. Will the epidemic status allow tourists visit Varna?Thank you"
"No one knows what the future will bring :-) For now, there is no quarantine for most of the EU countries, including Cyprus.Bulgaria has already welcomed the first tourists for summer 2020, all safety conditions are increased.Currently, there is no panic or reinforced worries"
"Thanks for reply,Unfortunately today Cyprus changed the status of Bulgaria to category B becouse after many days with 0 covid cases here, travellers from Bulgaria found positive. So it looks that we will loose our holidays and money we paid to get there. Anyway thanks for reply and hope Bulgaria will control the situation."
