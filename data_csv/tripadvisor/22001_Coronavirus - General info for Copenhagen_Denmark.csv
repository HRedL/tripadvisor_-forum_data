"Even though there are no major issues in Denmark regarding coronavirus at this time, be aware that many events with more than 1000 spectators/participants will most likely be cancelled - so far until the end of March. If you have a ticket for such an event, make sure to stay up-to-date on the status.Museums, restaurants, shops, attractions etc. are open as normal (per March 6)."
Has there been any official decree or ruling about the issue? Would you happen to know the best website for future information? (We have a gig coming up in May at Royal Arena.)
"No official ruling. This morning, The Danish Health Authority has DISCOURAGED events with more than 1000 people (but they're not prohibited), so far until the end of March. I would however expect most hosts to follow this recommendation.So far, the outbreak in Denmark is modest, with only 23 recorded cases (2 of which are on the Faroe Islands).The Danish authorities have just launched a new joint website about COVID-19 in Denmark: www.coronasmitte.dk The Danish version of the website is packed with information, the English version is not as extensive (at the time of writing this). The website also contains links to other relevant authorities."
"I appreciate this, thank you!"
"My granddaughter and I have our flights and hotel booked for July, so having this information is very helpful. Thank you for posting."
"We are watching what is happening. We have decided pretty much that IF our concert at DR Koncerthus on April 30th is cancelled, we will most likely not go. I am in seventies and Hubby is in his 80's but we are both in great health. Our numerous hotels over ten days can be cancelled without a charge. Not so sure about SAS attitude but we can rebook for a fee according to what they say on their website and ticket level at the current time. Just highly upset about this whole matter as I am sure many others are. We have been planning this trip for a long time but thoughts of being put in a 14 day quarantine upon returning to States is not a good option nor issues traveling about Denmark. Yes, we are having issues here in the States (Massachusetts) where we live. Waiting and seeing.. ."
"It's definitely going to wreck a lot of plans, that's for sure. It's highly unfortunate.Some event organizers try different ""tricks"" to circumvent the request, like the Royal Theatre reduces their capacity to below 1000 by keeping every other seat empty. Not an ideal solution if you ask me.If I had to guess based on how the virus is developing (especially in our neighboring countries, lots of cases in Germany and Sweden), I think the government will extend their request to prevent large gatherings further than March 31, but as you say, we can just wait and see."
Heading to Copenhagen (fingers crossed) next Friday-20th! This thread is so helpful and any updates would be greatly appreciated she’d of my trip
"As per today, March 10:156 confirmed cases - health authorities expect that number to rise in the following days (no big surprise there).Incoming flights banned from all of Iran and parts of Italy (Piemonte, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Aosta Valley, Veneto and Marche), South Korea (Daegu and Gyeongbuk province), Austria (ski-resort Ischgl) and China (Hubei province). For now effective for 14 days, but will be extended if necessary.Already purchased train tickets (with DSB) can be refunded at no extra cost for the buyer.The metro in Copenhagen has put extra trains in service, so people can (attempt) to keep a safer distance from each other.Generally the city is operating as normal, so you can still enjoy yourself, but obviously need to keep an eye on the situation."
Thank you again-I’ll look to make a decision next week as we fly next Friday
"DSB has announced that they're working on introducing mandatory seat reservations on Regional and InterCity trains in response to the coronavirus outbreak. No further details have been released yet, but it's something to keep an eye on for those who are considering to travel by train in Denmark (and for those of us who do it regularly)."

"HiThe link doesn't seem to be working in English. I'm due to go to Copenhagen for a few days on Friday 13th. We were thinking that we would still come but only if things we operating as normal...like restaurants, bars, tours etc. Would appreciate any information regarding this"
"So far everything is still operating as normal. The case number shot up to 442 though, which is obviously not a good sign.Italy and Austria are extremely popular destinations for Danes to go skiing and the vast majority of the cases so far have been people returning from trips to those areas. No significant community spread (yet).I think it's likely that more strict measures will be put in place in the next few days, if it continues to develop like it seems to. The Prime Minister is holding a press briefing later tonight, I'll update here if there's any relevant news presented."
"Well, that was a lot of news.Schools are closing down, bars, nightclubs etc. will be closed. Unsure exactly regarding restaurants, shops and such. I think a lot will close.So basically, I would not recommend visiting at this point."
"Thanks very much for any information, I really appreciate any updates and advice on whether to travel!"
Thanks Jacob D your information has been very helpful.

"For now, it's from this Friday and the following 14 days, but highly likely it will be extended into April.All government employees in non-critical jobs will be sent home this Friday as well, and will stay home for the following 14 days.Shops are open and there's no shortage of food or toilet paper etc., so it's not a lockdown as in Italy, but it will be a lot quieter than normal and people are requested to stay home as much as possible. Large events will be cancelled."
"I don't know yet, but it seems likely that at least publicly owned MUSEUMS/SIGHTS will close for a minimum of two weeks as well.This could very well be the case for the privately administered as well.But I still don't have any official confirmation of this - I guess we'll know more tomorrow local time/Thursday.Edited: 7:08 pm, March 11, 2020 "

"As of right now, there are no issues getting to/from the airport and into the city - but the list of countries that have incoming flights banned will most likely grow in the next few days/weeks, so I wouldn't make any plans at the moment.It's not a lockdown as such, people are free to move around and private employees are still at work (but those able to work from home are strongly encouraged to do so). Some companies have closed down voluntarily. Public employees will be home for the next two weeks and schools and universities are closed as well. I would check again as your date approaches, so we'll know more about the situation, since it develops quite rapidly."
"The situation does indeed develop quite rapidly, and it's still too early to say how things will look in mid-April.I'd like to add that the government is looking into the possibility of implementing further restrictions on entry to Denmark. Such restrictions can include mandatory medical checks upon arrival and the possibility of mandatory quarantine or denied entry for foreigners who are arriving from countries/regions where the situation is critical. Don't panic, but follow the situation closely."
Hopefully things get better by April 15th as me and my dad booked our holiday late last year for Copenhagen and was looking forward to coming so if theres hardly anything to do I'm going to be completely disappointed. It's understandable stopping the spread of the disease but still it's a kick in the teeth
We have decided to cancel our trip. Just not worth the two weeks of self quarantine in the States for a questionable two week trip that may also have issues. Now I have to figure out when we will be rescheduling..... We definitely want to go to Denmark and it will most likely be in the fall.
"I do wish to thank all the great Danish posters @Jacob D, @joen.dk and @I_am_a_Dane for doing such a great job of keeping all well informed about the situation. You do need to be commended for your great effort. THANKS!"
"You're very welcome. I think it's the right decision. Better to wait this one out than to get caught in the middle of it. I'm guessing it'll take a few months before things settle down again and they probably don't want to start up with concerts, sports events and such right away, there'll most likely be an adjustment period to reduce the risk of another wave."
"@Ventspilniece, as I understand it, there's no issue in getting FROM the US into/layovering in a Schengen-country. It's only when you need to get back to the US.But you should obviously double-check with SAS to make sure, I'm just some guy on the internet. A lot can change in a week as well, so what applies today may not apply in a few days."
"Just an update: we arrived in Copenhagen on 10th March. Whilst we had no issue finding public transport from the airport to city centre, on 11th march (Wed) we were also fine, but did not do much as we were celebrating the wife's birthday and pampering her more.When we had dinner at a michelin star (kokkeriet) it was mentioned that it has been much easier to get bookings (hence why I was surprised i could make bookings 1-2 days in advance only) - they have had 170 bookings cancelled in just a week period.Today we also dined at The Studio - and it was mentioned that there has been quite a tough time for restaurants and Danish establishments. For me they all seemed still busy but perhaps the true 'busy' is much more than what we are used to given we are coming in winter and have never been before.Unfortunately we did not get the memo last night on 11 th March - a local did send me an email (that we'd met) - gyms and other classes, were cancelled. Had we known we would have saved time - we walked to Slotsholm (for the Christiianborg polaace, royal stables etc) - and found that everything was shuttered today (12th March). Supposedly Danish authorities only sent out the memor today (12th March). We then did a quick google on all the other areas we planned to visit these next 3 days - Rosenborg, Amelienborg palace, National museum, the Carslberg Glypotek, and even the Church of OUr savior are all shuttered. Walking there they all had signs up. Until the 30th March.But who knows if it will extend if things go worse? We are somehwat shattered that the closured kicked in on our first real day of sightseeing. Had we been 3 days earlier we would have done all our sightseeing. So for now the rest of our trip is pretty much a writeoff. I would advise others coming in March - unless food and drinks and walking around is sufficient, most of the public 'tourist' stuff is closed.What is more shocking is upon learning of these closured we decided to walk to Christianshaven to just 'walk around'. We grabbed a coffee on the way and the first cafe had a sign that they were only doing takeout... and max 3 perosns in line - wait outside. So we moved on given it was so windy today we wanted an indoor.We then went to The Packhouse nearby - this time shut completely for 14 days due to coronavirus. I am shocked that even coffee/cafes are quarantining themselves - the major joints and bakeries were still open, but it is just something to consider given our experiences.TollehaverneKBH was open when we went in the evening (albeit we went after closure time). Not sure if this will stay open for much longer.Hopefully restaurants and cafes stay open at least otherwise it will be pretty much walking only (to sightsee) for tourists given you can not enter the public sights."
"A local did suggest a 'private museum' might accommodate given the public ones need to follow guidelines. I had never heard of private museums before - perhaps a local can advise if these are worth visiting and if they are effected? given we are not into art I can imagine most of the non-art museums, sights (palaces, gardens, historical etc) are all the publicly owned ones, so probably not much left to do?Open to any suggestions from locals on what to do to pass some time for the next 2 days with most of the public places closed."
"@Claudia N., Thank you for the recognition.@SaberX, As far as I can see, the privately-owned museums are closed, just like the publicly owned ones. So it seems that everyone is following the official guidelines by closing indoor cultural institutions for the next 2 weeks (which can be prolonged). Copenhagen Zoo is still open, as it's mainly an outdoor thing: https:/… It also appears that canal boat tours are still operational: https:/… I hope you find something meaningful to do for the next 2 days!Goodnight from me!"
"Thank you @I_am_a_Dane.Bad news. We have a friend visiting to meet up from London (ex-pat) today (Friday 13th).When I looked one or two days ago we had a few good restaurants and I planned to book Pony - part of the Kadeau family. Rude awakening as I have just tried to book and plans are in disarray: website reads that all in the Kadeau family are shut for rest of March in light of coronavirus and everyone's health interests!After much rushing around i have found that other restaurants are closed: formel B, Kødbyens Fiskebar.... I then tried ""Host"" - another well rated institution and also closed. I cannot see any bookings available for Studio by The Standard for march, we were there today so it is weird that you cannot make bookings (there were many spare tables at the lunch)... i presume bookings have ceased until they work out what they will do (and honour existing ones).We found a booking at Marv & be thankfully... but i hate to imagine that more high end restaurants will be shutting for March as it appears many hear are following the Danish authorities with the rest of March....Perhaps then for those thinking of travelling for food and wine and just walking around town - it may be worth reconsidering. I have only looked at one or two of the food options and not all, but the fact that these are closed for March means many others may follow suit.Our next stop was Zurich in order to head to Zermatt - this may be at risk now too given it is a tourist epic centre. Even if they don't close the ski lifts i guess the worry is this is tourist central....Sad and scary times indeed.Edited: 8:18 pm, March 12, 2020 "

The PM has announced that tourists will be denied entry to Denmark.
"it is going to be a very quiet city -- take care, everyone!"
"Thanks to all in Denmark for posting info on here! It's been really helpful in making the decision to not fly in these very uncertain times. We are gutted that we are not flying over today for a short break!! Rebooked for July though and hopefully things will be calmer by then. Stay safe and looking forward to our first trip to Copenhagen in July, fingers crossed. Many thanks again!!"
I give your post a like.
"Hi everyone. Im currently in Sweden (landed in Copenhagen on the 11th and the flight home is from Copenhagen on the 24th). Since the border closure i booked a flight from Sweden to Copenhagen just to connect to fly home to Canada. Does anyone think that will be an issue since i won't be leaving the airport in Copenhagen? I looked at earlier flights from Sweden but there is nothing that doesn't keep me in an airport for many hours (which is probably not the safest place to be and i want to limit my time in them). I've emailed the airport, the Canadian embassy, my airline. Haven't received any answers yet so any insight would be appreciated! Thank you!"
"In the entry restriction Q&A on the offical website www.coronasmitte.dk, the authorities write:""Personer, der krydser den danske grænse for at komme hjem, f.eks. svenskere, der har været på ferie i udlandet, vil blive anset for at have et anerkendelsesværdigt formål med indrejsen. Det samme gælder ved transit i lufthavnen og for flypersonale."" Source: https:/…indrejserestriktionerThis translates to:People crossing the Danish boder to return home, e.g. Swedes who have been on holiday abroad, will be considered to have a valid reason for entry. The same goes for transit in the airport and flight crew.Based on this I would say that you most likely won't have a problem entering Denmark with the purpose of going directly to the airport to fly home from your holiday.Flights may be cancelled and Canada, Denmark and/or Sweden may introduce further restrictions, so keep an eye on the situation!Edited: 5:48 am, March 14, 2020 "
Thank you so much!
Denmark has closed the border for tourist until 13 April
I just want and longing for to be able to write and read about the good experiences (sights) our countries can provide in the future.

"As far as I understand, transiting is deemed a valid reason for entering. On the infopage it specifically only mentions transiting in airports and since you arrive by train, I can understand your confusion.I would imagine that if you're in the train and have your flight booking printed out and ready to show at the check, that it would be allowed. That's just my interpretation though. If you contact the airline you're flying with, I would think they can give you a definite answer.Also check with your destination if Denmark is on their ""ban""-list, since you could risk being placed in quarantine at arrival."

"Not surprisingly, the government announced today that all restrictions, school and border closures etc. will be extended to April 13.We'll see if it will be extended even further at that point. I'm guessing it will be, but I hope I'm wrong."

"Latest updates from the Prime Ministers press briefing this evening (Apr 6):Borders will remain closed until May 10 for all non-essential travelers (tourism is obviously considered non-essential).All large gatherings (festivals, markets, concerts etc.) will be cancelled until September.Churches, libraries, hairdressers, restaurants etc. will remain closed until further notice."
"Updates from today's press briefing (April 14):Borders will remain closed until May 10 for all non-essential travelers (tourism is obviously considered non-essential). Will probably be extended, at least for certain nationalities/areas.Churches, libraries, hairdressers, cafées, restaurants, malls (except for supermarkets inside malls) will remain closed for now.Large gatherings (festivals, markets, concerts etc.) banned until September.Ban on gatherings for more than 10 people continuing until May 10 (will likely be extended).Since the curve has been flattened (peak seems to have been at April 1), non-critical surgeries and other treatment will now start back up at hospitals. Covid-related hospitalizations down from 535 (April 1) to 380 today. ICU-capacity for Covid-related cases at about 10% currently.Schools starting up for the smallest kids tomorrow. For older kids, schools are still closed.So all in all, careful optimism for now.

"Just intuition, but given the risky situation also in Europe overall, I find it very, very likely.France has just prolonged a general ~24h curfew well into May.Edited: 4:11 am, April 15, 2020 "
"I agree with joen, I think it's quite likely. The government has been taking a fairly cautious approach and has said many times that the gradual reopening will be done slowly and carefully - and that some restrictions might be reapplied, if the curve starts moving in the wrong direction again.I think it's likely that borders will be reopened gradually as well, depending on what the situation is like in the various areas of the world. Unless there's a dramatic improvement in the next month or so, which seems unlikely."
"Updates from today's press briefing (April 20):Hairdressers, tattoo parlors, driving instructors, dentists etc. will be able to reopen, if they can follow guidelines to make it as safe as possible in their place of business.No current plans to reopen borders in the immediate future.Testing capacity has now been expanded as part of the strategy to reopen the country, so anyone with suspicions of symptoms will be able to get tested.Hospitalizations currently at 336 (peak was 535 on April 1)."
"Apparently the total Danish ICU capacity as regards ventilation machines is around 1238, which indicates a good margin up to any reaching a severe crisis in the health system in that field.Some experts, including a leading official, Kåre Mølbak, has talked about the various social distancing measures as likely to continue for more than a year here, until a vaccine is generally obtainable. Obviously his statements are causing a lot of discussion.Medicine that reduces symptoms, and improved diagnostics/ treatment plans, are likely to appear within just a few months, however.Edited: 10:54 am, April 20, 2020 "
"I don't have much hope for my planned trip to Copenhagen in late July, however, I haven't cancelled anything yet. As of now, my flights are still on schedule, but even if they were to go ahead, I seriously doubt that any country in Europe would be open to travelers from the US, give the mess we're in thanks to the federal government."
"I think you're probably right, it seems unlikely at this point. I wouldn't even bet on travel internally within Europe at that time, except for maybe between a few select areas.As we're now in the first reopening phase, case numbers are expected to rise and hopefully we're going to find the right balance between keeping the economy going and keeping the virus under control. The tourism sector is pretty much still fully closed down and must be expected to be among the first to be closed back down, once it gets reopened and if case numbers then rise too fast.They've announced that more detailed information about phase 2 of the reopening will not be announced until just before May 10, as they're gathering data on the impact of phase 1 first, before making those decisions."

"Norwegian Airlines seems to gave gained financial support. Sketched plans indicate a re-start with domestic routes, then routes in Scandinavia, then European destinations afterwards, and overseas routes lastly.

"It sounds like Germany will make it possible to travel from Denmark to Germany from May 15.The Danish Minister of Justice said today that he's still sceptical regarding opening the borders just yet, so it sounds like it might not be reciprocated, which is surprising. I would have assumed it would be done from both sides simultaneously. I guess we'll know more at their press briefing at the end of the week."
"Mette Frederiksen (Prime Minister) has just held another press conference. The topic was phase 2 of the reopening of Denmark, which will gradually begin starting May 11th.During the press conference, Mette F said that the government will make an announcement regarding the reopening of the Danish borders by June 1st at the latest. We don't know how or when the reopening of the borders will take place, but now we know that we will hear more about that issue no later than June 1st. For now, the borders remain closed for foreign tourists.As part of phase 2, restaurants and cafés will be allowed to reopen from May 18th, however, there will be restrictions on the opening hours and on the physical distance between people. And as long as the borders are closed, I can imagine that this is of no use to most of the people who are following the information on the Copenhagen/Denmark forums.Edited: 2:45 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"Phase 2 of the reopening was just announced. Because the infection rate is still falling even after Phase 1, they're proceeding with Phase 2 now.

"Some details regarding PHASE 2 still needs to be in place, it seems, including the restrictions on restaurants and eating places, where apparently the plan is to demand 2 m between tables - a measure that the industry hopes will be somewhat modified, etc.A political agreement about PHASE 3 + 4 has now also been made. But everything will be adjusted according to the situation:PHASE 3, June 8: - Museums- Bigger art galleries- Cinemas- Aquariums- Amusement parks- Zoos- Botanical gardens- Summer activities for children & youngsters- gatherings of up to 50 people allowedPHASE 4, early August:- all remaining educational institutions- discoteques and night life - fitness centres, sports & swimming places- gatherings of ore than 500 people will continue to be forbidden at least until August 31stEdited: 2:32 am, May 08, 2020 "

"A lot of lessening travel restrictions in many parts of Europe in early summer, it seems, contrary to earlier alarm and predictions. No doubt due to the influence of the economy.Negotiations are still ongoing, but there'll probably be news about the details concerning border restrictions, safety measures and logistics very soon. And there's a big pressure from Germany and other EU members for opening up.Ryanair is apparently planning to re-instate a lot of flights in July, for example.I personally foresee a lot of virus expansion because of this. But when official restrictions are loosened, everyone must make their decisions then. In spite of being an eager traveller in Europe, I personally prefer to be within easy reach of my own, national authorities and health care system this summer, so I'm going to have a vacation here only.Edited: 1:59 am, May 14, 2020 "
"@ joen.dk, I completely agree with you: “When official restrictions are loosened, everyone must make their decisions then. In spite of being an eager traveler in Europe, I personally prefer to be within easy reach of my own, national authorities and health care system this summer, so I’m going to have a vacation here only.”For me, the decision to travel this summer is complicated by the fact that last December, we pre-paid thousands of USD to visit Denmark in July. Denmark’s decisions going forward will definitely be interesting, as will the policies of the airlines and hotels. In the end, regardless of these decisions and policies, travelers will make their decisions based on their personal risk tolerance."
"Yes. In my post, I didn't write about the number of virus cases going down quite significantly here in Denmark in the past weeks. A decrease that has taken place even after some loosening of the lock-down measures, and now with less than 1/3 of the previous number of hospitalizations, for example. Compared to the earlier, very sinister warnings, some are now talking about this relative success as a local 'Miracle of the Spring 2020'. Obviously, we all hope for the situation to become more normalized, but personally I think it is still too early to rest too assured.Edited: 12:32 am, May 15, 2020 "

"This virus while new in and of itself it is still a coronavirus. As such there was always a reasonable chance it would behave in predicable ways. One predicable way is to disappear in the spring, which we may be seeing now. Spring lasts until about June 20 in the northern hemisphere"
"Denmark’s success in responding to the virus is impressive. And, yes, there is a reasonable chance the virus will behave in “predictable ways” this spring. On the plus side, there may be a window of opportunity to travel this summer. On the minus side, a lot of the joy has gone out of it.No doubt, Denmark’s decisions on how and when it opens its borders to the rest of the world will be made with great care. As well they should be."

"A new agreement was reached yesterday evening between all political parties, meaning that some of PHASE 3, originally planned to be initiated on June 8th, can begin immediately. So:- Museums, bigger art galleries, aquariums, cinemas, botanical gardens and Zoos are allowed to open now;- the same applies to summer activities for children;- amusement parks, but some activities like rollercasters won't be allowed, or will be warned against.- full opening of main media (TV, radio etc)- association activities, except choral singing etc.- high schools, schools and courses involving overnight stays- public offices, except in the Copenhagen and Zealand regions, where the infection risk is somewhat biggerFrom the 8th of June, gatherings of up to 50 people will be allowed.BORDERS, FROM THE 25th OF MAY:The admittance from citizens of Germany and the Nordic Countries is relieved a bit, if one has close family in Denmark, or owns a summer house here.Business travel restrictions to Denmark are loosened somewhat.FURTHER NEWS about later opening plans, also dependent on virus development, should be presented on May 29th. This is expected to involve parts of the BORDERS QUESTIONS and TOURISM, such as the summer house sector. Some dates that could function for further openings and initiatives could be June 8th, July 8th and August 8th.STILL CLOSED:- discoteques, night life and venues; large gatherings; borders (for most travellers, including tourists), some public institutions and offices, sports events, some other events incl. festivals.VIRUS DEVELOPMENT may still result in changes in all of these initiatives, however.Edited: 12:36 am, May 21, 2020 "
"By far the most experts here agree that the new openings, that take place at a quicker pace than recommended by many, and seem to be the result of mainly economical and political/psychological pressure, will leave a lot of importance to the exact behaviour of individuals. And that the risk of a setback is high, because of people feeling free and losing interest in the subject, plus irresponsible behaviour generally.Seeing how social life in the city is now almost back to normal these days, I'd certainly tend to agree.Edited: 6:43 am, May 21, 2020 "
I am planning to visit Copenhagen in August. Can you tell me if any of the exhibitions at The Black diamond royal Library are open.
"At the moment, not likely. Libraries only opened a few days ago and no browsing or meeting other people, reading newspapers etc. is allowed. You have to make an appointment and can only pick up and deliver books you've already ordered.At my local library they set up a ""one way path"" through the entrance and out another door to exit, so you basically don't bump into anyone else on the way. I'm not sure how they set it up at the Black Diamond, but I would assume something similar.Of course a lot can change before August, so it's too early to say for certain. If the infection rate is still kept well below 1.0, it's likely these restrictions will be eased somewhat."
"Not all attractions will open immediately, but here's a list of the dates so far for a good deal of them:https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2020-05-22-sn…Tivoli in Copenhagen says 'some time during next week'.Edited: 9:57 am, May 22, 2020 "
"""And that the risk of a setback is high""In the US the top medical experts said that about opening the State of Georgia, one of the first states to reopen. The result: the situation has only become progressively better. In fact today one of the top doctors said there is significant decline in the virus throughout the US, except in a three or four areas. Even there it's a lot better than most of the US two weeks ago. Almost all of the US is or is reopening to a fair degree now. It appears the virus is going away forever, like some top virologists predicted, however I will still practice strict social distancing and handwashing until it does. It will be very interesting to see what becomes of the situation worldwide."
"It may be advisable to review the latest facts regarding the Covid-19 situation in the State of Georgia. The upward trend in cases and deaths bears watching.https://www.11alive.com/article/news/health/…While the virus may be taking a “break” in some places as the weather warms up, this pandemic is far from over. The best we can do right now is insist on accurate data and listen to credible scientists as we make our personal decisions.As of today, there have been 96,002 deaths in the U.S. due to Covid-19. That’s an increase of 1.852 deaths over yesterday’s total.https:/…cases-in-us.htmlI’m confident Denmark will make prudent decisions going forward.Edited: 8:52 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Trizssa seems to have an agenda that I can't really figure out. He/she likes to refer to ""top virologists"" that predict the virus will disappear forever. I haven't seen any evidence pointing to that at all, basically no one knows at this point. It may disappear or it may come back for a second wave. I would be very sceptical believing people that claim they know for sure whether it's one or the other. It seems responsible at this time to prepare for the worst, but hope for the best.We've had a few days in a row with no deaths here and the amount of hospitalized people with Covid-19 is also dropping. However we also just recently reopened restaurants, schools, etc., so we'll see what happens. At least we have sufficient testing capacity now that anyone can book a test without having to be referred by a doctor or have a job in a particular sector. That's an important step before reopening everything.As joen mentioned in a post above, borders are slowly reopening as well, but for now only for certain people from the Nordic countries and Germany. I think it will be a while yet until borders are fully reopened. We should know more in a few days, which might help potential tourists decide whether to rebook or cancel current plans."
"I seem to have an agenda? That's nonsense. I just have been expressing my opinion for what the future may look like. For travelers to and in Europe it's interesting what others think. Yes, it's true no one knows what the outcome will be but aren't we free to express our opinions without being labelled as ""they have an agenda"", meaning something negative? How about I'm giving people the bright side to consider? The news media sure likes to give the negative side, no?Edited: 11:40 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"You're saying you want to balance out the media's mostly pessimistic/negative coverage of the virus by offering a more optimistic viewpoint? That sounds like an agenda to me, particularly because you make definitive statements based on little to no evidence. I like optimism as much as the next guy, but you have to base it on factual evidence.However, this thread in particular is to give relevant travel advice regarding the coronavirus for travelers to Denmark and not for us to have this discussion. You're welcome to send me a PM if you want to discuss further, but let's keep this thread on topic."
"From the press briefing this afternoon:Borders will be opened on June 15 for tourists from Germany, Norway and Iceland (with some restrictions, like proof of accommodation for minimum 6 days - and it has to be outside of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municipalities).There are ongoing talks with Finland and Sweden and borders may be opened for those two countries as well in the near future (most likely only for parts of Sweden, specifically the Skåne region).Borders will remain closed for citizens from all other countries for the time being.Edited: 8:44 am, May 29, 2020 "
"Excellent recap from Jacob D. I'd like to add 2 things:- Opening of the borders for tourists from other EU countries and the UK are not expected to happen until after the summer (the month/date has not been specified yet, we may not get any more news on this until after the summer) - as stated above, with the possibility of reopening earlier for Swedish and Finnish tourists.- The minimum accommodation requirement is 6 NIGHTS (not 6 days)."
"This is going to be tough for the capital's hotels, though domestic tourism and maybe autumnal campaigns might compensate just a little.Danes themselves are recommended by the government to have a domestic vacation, or go to Germany, Iceland and Norway. This until the 31st of August, unless things change.Edited: 9:35 am, May 29, 2020 "
"For tourists resident outside of Germany, Iceland and Norway, the relevant piece if information is that they cannot enter Denmark before 31st August at the earliest.The announcement also appears to mean that the deciding factor is where the traveller lives, not where they are entering Denmark from. It does not mean that the borders are open for everyone - so it will not be (legally) possible for example to fly from London to Hamburg and then drive across the border into Denmark."
"Thank you for the information. Is there an official document with details of the regulation? I'm especially interested in the ""outside of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municipalities"" definition. As far as I understand it, booking a hotel in Kastrup (Tårnby Municipality) is okay,"
"@theoneiloveorg, That's how I understand it too. The only official document I have seen so far is a fact sheet uploaded today to www.coronasmitte.dk (scroll down for the 'in English' tab, then select the 'latest news' tab). They use the vague term ""Copenhagen"", but I think I heard one of the ministers specify it to the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg when answering a question at the press conference. If in doubt, you can also contact the hotline on coronasmitte.dk."
"@I_am_a_Dane, you definitely heard correct, that was their definition. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that you can book a hotel just outside those two municipalities and spend the entire day in Copenhagen only to go back to your hotel to sleep, but you can't sleep in a hotel in those municipalities. Seems weird to me, but those are the rules apparently.It's a good suggestion to contact the hotline though, just to make sure. It would be a real shame to get turned away at the border due to a technicality."
"@Jacob D, @I_am_a_Dane, thank you very much for the link and your views on the matter. I hope, I will find out soon, if I can spend my holidays there or if I have to cancel the booking. It seems, I just like the restaurants in Copenhagen too much ;-)"
"#100 and #101: Yes, the minister talked about the Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municiplaities specifically:""Københavns Kommune og Frederiksberg Kommune vil være omfattet af denne her ordning. Det er for at mindske risikoen for smitte. At tage sin ferie i de to kommuner, der kommer ikke til at ske«, siger Nick Hækkerup om forbud mod overnatninger fra turister i København.(https:/…B8benhavn)The suburban areas have a limited hotel capacity compared to the city centre though, so it will reduce the number of tourists in the capital, and the total amount of time they tend to spend there.Edited: 3:29 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"The information in https:/…coronavirus now is quite clear: ""This booking must be for a stay taking place outside the capital Copenhagen (Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg Municipality) and must last at least six nights. Residences with the postcodes 1000 through to 2500 are considered to be in those locations. Tourists are allowed to visit Copenhagen but their stay must be outside it."" So this is okay for me :-)"
"Perfect! Good thing they put in that clarification, the postcodes are at least a very easy way to see if a hotel is inside or outside the allowed area."
"The T troll is once again wrong. No disappearing virus in the year 2020. Be safe, be well, be smart. Report T Trolls."
"Tivoli in Copenhagen reopens today - of course with some restrictions.The ban on gatherings of more than 10 people has also been raised to 50 people (and in special cases with seated areas up to 500, for example at football matches and conference centers with adequate spacing).Copenhagen is starting to feel and act ""normal"", so hopefully the situation will remain stable, so we can avoid shutting things down again. I'm sure restaurants and cafés will be happy to see some tourists again."
"Does anyone know if this means you have to say in just one accommodation for 6 nights, or is it possible to spend it in two different places, e,g, 3 nights in two different hotels?Thanks"
"@AMrtnIts does not matter if you stay 6 different places, as long as you can document you are not staying in Copenhagen for more nights."
"Hello everyone. I need help.Last year I planned to visit Copenhagen at the end of July/2020. Not happening, of course.I booked 3 nights with a non-refundable rate at Astoria Hotel and I am asking a voucher or a discount to rebook for next year but they refuse saying they are following the government's recommendations and that I knew the risks of losing money when I chose to pay the lowest price. And yes, I knew, but I never imagined that there would be a pandemic (the last one was 100 years ago) and I thought that in such a unique moment everyone would help each other. Any tips, everyone?"
"@fe_pena,You've already done the right thing by asking for a voucher/rebooking. Unfortunately, unless there's a special clause in the contract that protects you in case of force majeure/a pandemic, the hotel is not obliged to give you a refund when you've booked a non-refundable stay - and legally the hotel is right when they say that it's part of the risk of choosing a non-refundable booking. If you've taken out cancellation insurance, you may be able to get a refund that way. I'm afraid that there aren't any more tips for this situation."
I guess you're just out of luck. I had a similar case - nonrefundable booking in Copenhagen end of July. Wrote to the hotel and politely explained. And they agreed to refund me.
thanks @I_am_a_Dane. And @beertravelerSLO I am happy for you...Maybe I should book your hotel for next year! But been serious... any specific argument you used?

"@JesperP, I am aware of ....and this was the reason that made me think that the hotel would make an exception ... Even if the borders were open to Brazilians, it wouldn't be polite of me to go now, right? I respect the Danish people too much to endanger them. The right thing to do is travel next year ... I just wanted the hotel to understand and share the loss with me. I don't even want a money refund... a simple voucher with a good discount for the next reservation would make me happy. Strange to imagine but we have better consumer services in Brazil ... here all companies would certainly be more open to negotiating.Edited: 7:21 am, June 13, 2020 "
"A correction:People in Iceland, Norway and Germany are welcome to spend the nights anywhere in Denmark from June 15."
"@fe_pena,It is unfortunate for sure. I don't really understand why a hotel would refuse a voucher or a rebooking, even on non-refundable tickets. I know they're not technically obligated to do so, but these are obviously not ordinary circumstances.I wouldn't say costumer service is terrible here (it can be), but some people are definitely not very flexible."
"Jesper, any word on when Americans will be allowed entry?"
Hi ryfunk.I don't know.Kind regards Jesper
"@ryfunk, It will most likely depend on how the virus develops in the US.The government announced today that they're prepared to open the borders for more countries (currently only Germany, Iceland and Norway) based on objective criteria. The primary criteria will be that the virus is at an ""acceptable"" level in that country.The exact parameters of the criteria have not been decided yet, but will be announced soon.Edited: 10:01 am, June 16, 2020 "
"The government have announced a further reopening of the Danish borders from June 27:- The borders will reopen for tourists who are residents in EU/Schengen/UK countries, but only if the COVID-19 reproduction rate is below a certain level in the country where the tourist is living.- The ‘6 nights minimum’ rule still applies, except for residents of Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Schleswig-Holstein who will be exempt from this rule.- The reproduction rate will be measured per country for EU/Schengen/UK, while it will be measured per region within the Nordic countries.The borders to residents from a given EU/Schengen/UK country will open when the weekly reproduction rate is under 20 per 100,000 residents. The borders will close when the weekly reproduction rate exceeds 30 per 100,000 residents. An official list of “open” and “quarantine” countries will be published on June 25 - the list will be updated by Statens Serum Institut on a weekly basis.More technical information will be released later today.

"@I_am_a_DaneI would like to ask question about 6 night accomodation. If i have one night stopover in Copenhagen and then 8 nights in Faroe Islands, is it okey ? It it considered asi more than 6 nights in Denmark ? Or more details will be announced in these days ?Thank you very much."
"@Matej Peluha,I don't think that exempts you from the 6 nights rule, but I don't know. While both Denmark and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, both countries function independently from each other: they have different parliaments, governments and laws (that's a very simplified explanation of the Unity of the Realm, the real world is a bit more complex).I don't think that the Danish government/authorities will release any details about what people should do in your specific situation. I suggest calling the Danish Police's arrivals hotline - their phone number is on www.coronasmitte.dk - but maybe wait a few days, if you're not in a rushEdited: 11:30 am, June 18, 2020 "
"Thank you very much. I am not in rush. I am coming on 30.8. so I have time. I will wait for more informations and if nothing useful for me, I will call them.Thank you."
I'm in the same situation. Have 3 nights in Denmark and a week in Farore islands. Only I'm travelling end of July.
"One important thing to add regarding the Faroe Islands is this: ""From 15 June, all visitors should be tested before travelling to the Faroe Islands. All visitors who reside overseas and travel to the Faroe Islands will be required to present proof of a negative COVID-19 test that has been taken within the last five days. Without such documentation, travel companies will refuse to take passengers.""Taken from the official Faroese website: https://corona.fo/travel?_l=enWhether that will apply in July or August is of course unknown at this time, but probably a good idea to keep an eye on it."
"Thank you very much. Its useful information. From my side its absolutely okey. In my country, there is not any problem with taking commercial test and its not even so expensive. My only problem will be, if its okey to sleep one night in Copenhagen and then come to Faroe Islands for 8 nights.....we will everobody see.....thank you for help and actual info :)"

"Hello, was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. I have a 4 hours layover in Copenhagen on 19th July, am coming from Singapore but I do hold a Finnish residence permit and I'm travelling onwards to Finland. Would any of you know if I could go downtown for a quick look around? It's my first time in Denmark and I really didn't want to pass up the opportunity of taking in some sights if possible."
"As the situation is right now, you won't be able to. You can read the most up-to-date info here: https://politi.dk/en/coronavirus-in-denmark/…What is particularly relevant for your situation is the following: ""You can transit through Denmark if your journey has a worthy purpose such as a homebound journey, attendance at a funeral or treatment at a hospital. The transit must be made without undue delay. This also applies to airport transit and aircrew in transit.""Of course the rules could change by July 19, so make sure to keep an eye on that website."
Thanks Jacob for the quick reply!
They decided today that the border will be open to almost all EU countries just not Portugal and Sweden. Not even the South. Very disappointed.
"At least it's based on objective criteria and not just because we ""want to"".English information about the border situation from June 27 can be found here: https:/…travelling-in-or-out-of-denmark"
Anybody knows if minimum 6 nights is considered also if I have 1 night in Copenhagen and 8 nights in Faroe Islands. I wrote questione earlier but just curious if anybody knows.In the final I think it will be necessary to call on particular phone numbers and find out by myself.
Rules regarding people from southern Sweden are confusing to say the least. https:/…A5-komme-alligevel-uden-test
Reporters from a border town newspaper in southern Sweden has tested the Helsingør border today. They were let in by simply providing proof of that they live in Skåne. They didn't require proof of a negative test.https://www.hd.se/2020-06-27/mot-helsingor-h…
"Why is this 6 nights reservation proof if you want to visit Danmark? What if my 3rd night is in a region with increasing numbers of Covid19 and that part of Danmark will get in Lock Down?Edited: 1:52 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"The current situation at the Swedish border is that you DO need a current, negative Covid-19 test if you're a resident of Skåne, Halland or Blekinge (residents of Västerbotten do not need the test). They went back and forth on this a few times within the same day, so it was a confusing mess. The regions allowed with/without a test is updated every week, so it's necessary to stay up-to-date before planning anything. The lists can be found here: https:/…entry-into-denmarkAnd it's important to mention that if you have a worthy purpose for entering Denmark, you don't need a test either - the definition of a worthy purpose can be found at the above link as well.@elrosso, as for the first part of your question, I think it's just an easy to administer way of limiting the amount of tourists to begin with. Having a 6-night reservation requirement makes sure people can rent vacation homes or go on extended stays, while avoiding a lot of ""weekend-tourists"".As for the second part of your question, I'm not sure I understand what you mean. We haven't done any regional lock downs in Denmark and I don't see that happening, unless something extraordinary occurs. It's highly unlikely that it would impact your ability to travel back home, if that's what you're concerned about.Edited: 4:12 am, June 28, 2020 "
"Thanks Jacob,Its not that I want to go home with the second part of my question, its that I will lose my money due to the cancellation policies. I understand it will be unlikely but in some countries it happens they close a city."
"If your country gets more than 30 new covid cases per 100,000 citizens you can't enter Denmark. This system is extemely bad for planning a vacation even just a few weeks in advance, as they can lock the border in front of your nose at literally any moment. The open border could even be seen as temporary, cause it can change if the criteria is no longer met. This is in sharp contrast to for example Sweden where people can enter regardless how many covid cases you have in the country you travel from."

"I think you are more or less delivering the counter argument yourself ... also, currently, the focus is on European travelers and opening up in Europe, where distances are shorter and planning easier. Not overseas travelers, coming from far away places like Brazil, US, NZ or elsewhere. Hotels are not overbooked, but airline transport in particular can be more difficult to reorganize within short notice, of course. However, establishing immediate public safety for the population has been a really important concern for the Danish government, and Denmark has done very well in this respect so far - also when the tendencies seem to be worrying again in quite a few places abroad.Edited: 3:21 am, June 29, 2020 "
"Does anyone know how strict the 6 nights reservations rule is being implemented?I was planning a 3 day visit in early August and was meaning to fly into Kopenhagen (I am from a cleared country btw). But since I'm only visiting for 3 days will I get into any trouble? Will I be actively asked for a 6 day reservation at the airport?I suppose I could just ""book"" 6 nights at some cheap hostel and show that, but that still leaves the return flight ticket."
"Rules are rules and TA posting is not about breaking them. It was just announced that Norwegians don't have to book the 6 nights, so if there is a good general development, things might change however, also for other travellers.Edited: 5:37 am, July 01, 2020 "
"Unless you have a 6-day reservation (and possibly proof of your return date) you might not even be allowed to board the flight to Copenhagen at your departure airport. Speaking to friends who have entered Denmark by road in the last week, the 6-day rule is certainly being checked at the land border."
It's also a matter of respect. Why would you knowingly go to another country and violate their Covid-19 rules? That is rather selfish and pretty low-class.
"Just to bring this thread back on track for general information. The current situation is overall quite good.17 people are being treated in hospital for Covid-19 (down from 500+ at the peak in early April). 6 of the 17 are in the ICU and 3 of those are on ventilators.Daily tests performed are around 15,000-18,000 and of those about 30 are positive. There are test-centres at the borders and airports and scattered around the cities and it's possible to get a test quite easily. This has been a main focus in the reopening strategy.Most things are open again, but there is still a ban on large gatherings at 100 people. Exceptions can be made for certain events.The most important current thing to be aware of is the 6-night minimum required stay for tourism-related visits. This is not likely to change until some time in August at the earliest.All relevant travel-related information in English can be found here: https://politi.dk/en/coronavirus-in-denmark"
"Another update. People from Skåne and Blekinge in Sweden and Schleswig-Holstein can enter Denmark for tourism purposes without restrictions and do NOT need to book 6 nights.People from other approved provinces need to book 6 nights however.Edited: 7:59 am, July 16, 2020 "
"Something that could be relevant for those arriving by plane:It's possible to get a Covid-19 test at Copenhagen airport on arrival. It's free both for citizens and tourists. No booking needed, you simply find the test center and get the test done. You'll then be contacted directly if it turns out positive.Currently they're doing 900 tests daily there, but will expand the operation as air traffic increases."
Interesting about the free tests. Thanks @Jacob D for keeping us so well informed. Hopefully things will be much better when we hope to travel next April/May. It was a disappointment to have to cancel our trip this year around this same time frame. Looking forward to 2021!
"Hi Jacob, I presume you are still not expecting the 6 night rule to change anytime soon? We are needing to book flights for a September trip and may need to extend the holiday but holding out to see if this measure is dropped."
"Hi Leila,I'd be surprised if we get any update on that until the end of August. I would expect them to remove the rule, unless there are major spikes in more countries.We're experiencing slightly rising numbers here as well. More or less expected with things reopening and people coming home from various travels, but still something to keep an eye on. If they keep rising, the government may get nervous and extend the rule. At this time, it's too early to say."
"Masks are now recommended in public transportation (busses, trains, metro). They're not required and you won't be fined if you're not wearing one, but they're still recommended, so might be good to bring some along if you expect to use public transportation.The only place they're required (at this time) is at the airports."
"To be specific, the masks are only recommended when it is crowded. Very light decision compared to the rest of Europe.Edited: 12:28 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"You're right. It's going to be difficult to keep distance during most of the day when using the metro and the busses, but of course as it's just a recommendation, it's going to depend on peoples common sense.I personally would have liked to see masks mandated, so we could better protect the vulnerable. Not because I think masks are going to prevent all spread, but it seems like a valuable tool in the toolbox and it's irrational not to use all your tools."
"#156 Rules regarding masks vary a lot throughout Europe, and there are countries with no recommendations (Sweden) or recommendations like the new Danish ones (~ Norway, Finland, Ireland, Estonia, Cyprus etc.), plus of course countries with stricter rules."
"I apologize if this was already posted but I can't find it in the long thread, Can someone post a link to any official site that mandates a 6 day booked stay for EU citizens? Thank you."
This is the official government site in English: https://politi.dk/en/coronavirus-in-denmark
"If you're in one of the countries in Europe with rising numbers and have a trip planned to Denmark in the near future, you should pay extra attention to the list of ""banned"" countries that is updated every Thursday at 16:00 local time. At this time it only contains Romania, Bulgaria and Luxembourg, but it looks like some additional countries will get added to the list unfortunately.You can find it here: https:/…is-my-country-open-or-banned"
"Many thanks for your update, we are exactly in that situation. I do assume that the politi.dk website which now says ""Applicable until Friday 7 August 2020 23.59"" means that the situation will not change before Friday Midnight, right? We aim to arrive on Friday and it will be a bit sour if we spend 10 hours driving only to be blocked at the border."
The updates from Thursday 16:00 are usually valid from Saturday 00:00 so Friday should be ok. If you have the numbers of found infections you can also calculate yourself. This Thursday I think they use the period of 22 July to 4 August. A country will go from open to closed if there are more than 30 found infections per week and 100.000 inhabitants.
"Yes, you should be ok as long as you get to the border before Friday at 23:59.The actual list can be found here (in Danish, but you can probably figure it out): https:/…It shows the average number of infections per 100.000 inhabitant over a two week period per country. It will be updated tomorrow and those numbers will then decide which countries are ""banned"" from Saturday at 00:00 - if they get above 30 (or in some instances 20 if the positive rate of tests is 5% or more - or testing is deemed insufficient)."
thanks to you both! We´re hoping for the best. Never thought going on holiday could be so stressful as this year!
"Only Andorra and Spain were added to the list.Romania, Bulgaria and Luxembourg remains on the list as well.Edited: 10:56 am, August 06, 2020 "
"A little update regarding face masks:Due to the increase in confirmed cases in Denmark (concentrated in a couple of areas, mainly Aarhus), it's now mandatory to wear a face mask in public transport in the Aarhus area. For the rest of the country, it's still only a recommendation when distancing is not possible. It may become mandatory all over the country if numbers keep rising as they seem to do right now. Pharmacies in Aarhus are pretty much all sold out of face masks at the moment, so if you plan on visiting and use public transport, it might be a good idea to bring a few from home.Most of Phase 4 of the reopening has also been cancelled for now, until this new surge in numbers is under control."
"Face masks are now also mandated in public transport and other crowded areas in the following municipalities (in addition to Aarhus): Silkeborg, Odder, Horsens, Skanderborg, and Favrskov.And still recommended in the rest of the country, when distancing is not possible. So if you plan on visiting, bring a few with you, so you won't have issues potentially getting rejected on public transport.Despite the rising numbers, the situation is still good overall. 23 people are hospitalized (down from 25 yesterday), 2 of those are in intensive care."
"After today's update, Belgium and Malta were added to the ""closed"" list. It now contains these countries:Spain, Andorra, Malta, Belgium, Romania, Luxembourg and Bulgaria.Arrival from these countries after Friday, August 14 at 23:59 is not possible for purely tourism-related visits."
"Updates from today's press conference:Face masks will now be mandatory (effective from Saturday, August 22) in all public transport in the whole country at all times. Taxis are also included. It may be expanded to other areas (shops, supermarkets etc.) in addition to public transport at a later time.They can be purchased at supermarkets and pharmacies. 1 million+ face masks will be supplied every day to the supermarkets until the demand has stabilized, so hopefully they will be reasonably easy to find. A 10-pack will be about 20-30 DKK (3-4 EUR/USD). Reusable cloth face masks are also accepted.Bars and restaurants will be able to stay open until 02:00/2 AM, but no additional guests are allowed entry after 23:00/11 PM.The 6-day rule for tourists will be removed. No effective date was mentioned at the press conference, but hopefully that will be clarified soon."
"Excellent recap by Jacob D.I'd just like to add that face masks will also be required on bus stations, train stations, metro stations and light rail stops. In addition to cloth and single-use face masks, visors are also approved as a ""face mask"" on public transport. Children under the age of 12 and adults with certain health conditions are except from the face mask requirement.Even though it's not a requirement until August 22nd, it's recommended that we follow this new rule starting today."
"Hello, Jacob. We are planning to go to Copenhagen this Thursday by train from Germany . Might you have any information about how the border control goes when u travel by train ? Do officers come inside train and what docs they check ? We plan to stay in friends flat so we won’t have hotel booking. Thank you!"
"It's all here - updated regularly.https://politi.dk/en/coronavirus-in-denmarkYes, the officers come on to the train and check your documents.Edited: 7:38 am, August 18, 2020 "
"The 6-night rule has been abolished effective a few days ago, but yeah the link above will show all the current rules and regulations. The only thing you need to check that is different from pre-Covid is if your country is open or closed, but that too is explained in the link above.If you show signs of illness, you will also be turned away at the border. So don't catch a common cold a few days before your holiday!"
"And of course masks. They're now mandated on all public transport at all times, also when you're waiting at a bus stop/train station."
Thank you!
"What will happen if my home country turns orange / banned while in Denmark. Do you have to leave the country, although you were already in Denmark?Edited: 1:59 pm, August 18, 2020 "
"No, it's only relevant for new arrivals. The list gets updated around 16:00/4 PM every Thursday and that list is then effective from the next day, Friday at 23:59/11:59 PM.If you're already in, don't worry, as your country of residence was yellow (open) when you entered."
"Apologies if it's already been covered, but am I ok to travel from Copenhagen to Malmo for a day trip? Thanks in advance"
"You can, as Sweden is now considered an ""open"" country. You should however keep an eye on the status, in case it changes from yellow to orange. The map is updated every Thursday at 16:00.https:/…is-my-country-open-or-banned"
"Jacob, the link only talks about residence. Are people residing in open countries really banned if they enter via/from a banned country?"
"Technically no, I think they could do the daytrip. At least as I understand the rules. But they'd need to bring all their documentation and might be asked a lot of questions at the border at re-entry. It might not be worth the hassle."
"Yes, it would be okay to go on a day trip to Sweden - but (as much as I love Sweden) I don't think it would be worth it:If Sweden turns into a ""banned/closed"" country, the Danish Foreign Ministry will advise against all non-essential travel to the country. People who have been to one of these countries are supposed to stay at home (or inside their hotel room, I guess) for 2 weeks after returning to Denmark.See ""What should I do when returning home to Denmark?"" on https:/…"
"The first Swedish region that Denmark put as open was Västerbotten. You can sail to Denmark from there, but otherwise it is pretty hard to get to Denmark without visiting a banned region."
"I understand your point, but transit has always been acceptable since they started with the open/banned lists, both through yellow and orange areas.Purposefully going to a banned area to spend the day and then return later the same day doesn't really fall into that category of transit.At this point it's of course pure speculation, as Sweden is still open. Even though the number went up a little this week, it's still a fair bit below 30, so let's cross our fingers it stays there."

"General update:From Saturday August 22, masks are now mandatory in all public transport at all times (including while at stations, bus stops etc.). Taxis and ride-sharing also included. If you're not wearing a mask, you will be asked to get off the train/bus. If you refuse, you will get fined 2500 DKK (~330 EUR, ~395 USD), so don't forget the mask. The rules are being enforced.Covid-related hospitalizations remain low at 19 people, despite rising case numbers (that now seem to flatten again fortunately).The current ""banned"" list include the following countries: Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, Malta, Monaco and Andorra. This list is updated every Thursday at 16:00/4 PM. If you're residing in France or Croatia and have a visit planned in the near future, you should pay extra attention to the list on Thursday, as those two countries are getting very close to the ""banned"" threshold. The list can be found here: https:/…is-my-country-open-or-bannedEdited: 3:50 am, August 24, 2020 "
"As expected, France and Croatia was added to the ""banned"" list of countries. Bulgaria was taken off the list.It now contains these countries: Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Romania, Malta, Monaco, Andorra, France, and Croatia."
"Hello,I had a trip planned to Denmark a long time ago that is scheduled on 23rd of October and it will last two weeks. I live in Qatar and I keep checking the Danish police website for updated on countries banned and allowed to enter, but can't seems to find a mention of Qatar. I know it is still somewhat early to tell if Qatar will be allowed to enter the country or not, but would very much appreciate help if any one is in the know.Thank you,"
"Unfortunately at the moment, Qatar is not considered an ""open"" country. Every country outside of the EU, United Kingdom or within the Schengen area is by definition considered ""banned"", unless specifically mentioned underneath the map (in the list of 'Other open countries'). I'm not quite sure of their criteria for countries outside of the EU/UK/Schengen. The 'Other open countries' list hasn't changed for a while though, so it seems fairly strict."
"Thank you Jacob for your response. I will keep checking the status on the open and banned countries, but hopefully things work out!Good night"
