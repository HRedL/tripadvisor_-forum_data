"Not a good start for resumption of commercial airline traffic in BDA - ""But it was revealed that one of the passengers broke the rules and headed straight to an unnamed restaurant.Kim Wilson, the health minister, said the breach was “very unfortunate”""Full article here:royalgazette.com/tourism/article/20200703/mi…"
"Earlier reports counted only 20 passengers aboard the flight. A later report counts forty-four(44) passengers.The details of the still un-identified single passenger who is reported to have broken the post-testing arrival quarantine protocol is still a bit hazy....saying only that they were seen in a local restaurant after their arrival...perhaps before the results of the of the mandatory arrival testing had returned a negative result (??)Near as I can tell from press reports, the passenger has been identified nor has this report been positively confirmed. The report is believable only because we all know that some people are just STUPID and believe themselves entitle to do whatever they damn well please..consequences to others be damned. Hopefully, the report has been exaggerated. It ain't as if the potential threat of Covid-19 hasn't been definitively identified and confirmed....and isn't well known to most of the people on the planet...no matter what the country or language.If this report is true....and a jerk has flounted the regulations and protocols...that public health officials scoop 'em up and lat 'em spend their quarantine period in a SOLAS life raft, anchored out over a reef."
I believe the 44 refers to tourist passengers. There may have been around 140 including Bermudians. At least one who has been trying to get back home for some months.I assume the majority of the 44 are Canadians. It would be interesting to hear from them whether they have medical insurance and at what cost.
">>>...It would be interesting to hear from them whether they have medical insurance and at what cost....<<<As near as I can tell from the information provided by the Bermuda government, https://cloudfront.bernews.com/wp-content/up…""..A visitor *** should *** (emphasis added) acquire health insurance covering illness outside of home jurisdiction to cover all health costs including those related to a positive Covid-19 diagnosis while in Bermuda. If this is not obtained, a visitor will be responsible for all health and accommodations costs if treatment and/or quarantine is required; including costs related to a positive Covid-19 diagnosis while in Bermuda...."". This phrasing--""..should..""--strikes me as an either/or '..option..'....rather than a mandatory '..requirement..'."
I know it's not mandatory but I'm interested in hearing whether people are being successful in getting insurance and on what terms.
... any information on how long it took to get Covid-19 results on arrival? ... in the meantime the Regime seems to have a robust Stasi to hound down violators!
"To Frank M - You are very bitter man, if you can't say anything nice, please do not post your nasty comments.Bermuda is doing their best to keep both tourists and residents safe, how is your country doing?"
"... short on two fronts mel ... (a) you don’t know me, and (b) you have no sense of humor ... other than tan I’m sure you are a fine person ... thanks!"
I thought people had to get a test before they went ? Am I wrong / misunderstood ?
Senior65 I know I've seen at least one person in the Turks and Caicos forum reporting they are unable to locate coverage at this time and have tried 4 different companies. Even if you had a pre-existing policy (which I currently have from a cancelled trip in April) I'm sure the travel advisory still being in effect would invalidate it.
... if you are a senior from the US and have supplemental coverage to Medicare many such plans cover foreign medical expenses while traveling. Mine is called a Schedule N supplemental plan and does include this coverage.
"A couple of points here ...A. I thought Delta was going to be the one airline that was going to practice “physical distancing?” I guess not. American Air recently did away with this and thus many of their planes are full, you know all those middle seats that were going to be empty. Guess what? They are full.B. The notion that tourists can come and do what they want and not follow the rules and protocols is something I’ve defined in my studies as “traveler privilege.” It’s the notion that if you are traveling and coming to a region that is facing hardship and economic loss as a result of the pandemic, you are exempt because you are traveling and spending money. We are likely to see a lot of this. Every island will be hit by this. It’s kind of an offshoot of the “pandemic ignorer” mindset.Here’s an earlier case in Antigua:https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destination…3. Traveler privilege will likely show up in all kinds of stories soon, such as guests not wearing masks when tthey need to, disregard for physical distancing, and not following testing and contact tracing procedures. It’s hard to police paying customers, especially if they are pandemic deniers or ignorers.4. The testing before travel strategy is going to introduce all kinds of problems, especially in cases where the timing of the test is done many days before travel. I get the practical and economic aspects of this big time, however the virus thrives on this kind of behavior. Risks are very significant."
">>>...I thought people had to get a test before they went ? Am I wrong / misunderstood ?...<<<NO...you're spot on. You must fill out and file a BERMUDA TRAVEL AUTHORISATION form prior to departure--https:/…bermuda-travel-authorisation . You must have negative results of a Covid-19 test performed 72 hours (to 5 days(??) prior to your departure. Once arrived at the airport in Bermuda you must take another Covid-19 test...then travel directly from the airport to your guest accommodation and quarantine-in-place until you receive notice that your airport arrival Covid-19 test is negative (usually within 8-12 hours)...then you are free to go out 'n about...observing all of the protective mask, social distancing, etc. protocols in effect in Bermuda."
"This is just my opinion and of course everyone is free to make their own decisions, but at this particular point in time, to climb into a tiny metal tube with 200 strangers....all breathing the same recycled air ......I would have to call that insanity. No one is a bigger fan of Bermuda than I am. I go back as often as my budget will allow. On this exact date LAST year, that's where I was.....having a wonderful time. I really miss it and would love to go back as soon as possible. But just the plane ride itself isn't worth the risk. Couple that with all the restrictions and hoops you have to go through to visit.....no thanks. Don't misunderstand me. I think Bermuda is doing the right thing with requiring all of those restrictions. They have to protect themselves and all indications are they are doing a great job of it. But I just don't think it's wise or worth it to travel right now. We'll see how things like NEXT year."
Thank you KDKsail for clarifying.
"Dave.....with my luck...if I were to board an aircraft to spend time on our favorite a pink sand,, surf-fringed Bermuda beach...I'd be seated in the middle of several Alabama college kids who'd been a a Covid-19 keg party the night before, a couple of people who'd were returning from a Trump campaign rally (Covid-19 might be a blessing compared to overheard political enthusiasm) and a next to a guy with an aluminum-foil lined '..I've Been Probed..' Area-5- ball cap. Thanks but...NO THANKS !!Edited: 5:50 pm, July 04, 2020 "
