"Have read so many people saying on forums that they’d like to be stuck in Tenerife .We’d love to be home . Very little official information ,and lots of rumours and rubbish on forums .We have had a reassuring email from Jet 2 to assure us they will get us a flight home . We’re lucky that we are in an apartment with a lovely roof terrace so we can get fresh air . We’re not due home till 27 th but I’m getting packed in hope that we’ll be offered early flight .My biggest fear is that one or both of us will take it .Even though we’ve good medical insurance,it won’t be much use in this situation. Whole thing seems unreal and very scary.Will not be booking anything until we’re assured this awful virus has been eradicated."
i thought of you today.is it the 27th your due home.take care
"Thanks Claire. Yes 27 th I’m sure there’s people in worse situations .Thinking of people here who’ll not get paid and lose their businesses and people at home that can’t afford to get extra in and apparently the food banks are suffering. It’s a very worrying situation for everyone.Edited: 5:57 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"My Mam is stuck, flight cancelled today. We are awaiting news of another flight being booked, she’s being well looked after by easyjet in a full board hotel which unfortunately means she is enjoying what they have on offer rather than communicating with us and getting another flight sorted!! Hope you also get sorted soon"

"We were talking about it this evening if we were ""trapped"" there. I think we'd also want to come home asap. It's going to be a miserable time for folk. We'd throw some money at the problem - book flight with any operator to any UK airport (and the Republic in the OP's case). At least back in the country, there are various ways to make the land journey (plus ferry for the OP). A pain in the wotsit of course but, for us, it'd be preferable to another two weeks in a lockdown"
"It’s an option to an extent John ,but not looking forward to airport either and for us a direct flight home is better than a couple of airports or a boat all of which are big risks We’re just hoping we might get offered an early flight .Strange to think when we came here at beginning of January we’d never heard of it ! True saying your life can change in an instant."
"Direct flight is obviously preferable, L. Hope they come up with one soon. In the meantime, take care of yourself and your bloke. As always, I'm at the end of the message system if you need to chat.JohnEdited: 7:02 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Check Jet2 as they will be bringing holidaymakers home. Although this notice refers to mainland. Check for the applicable notice you require.Jet2 in line with the decision made by the Spanish government, we’re cancelling all flights to Mainland Spain (Alicante, Barcelona, Murcia and Malaga) for at least the next seven days. Our flights from Mainland Spain to the UK are running as scheduled until 21 March 2020 (inclusive). If your booking is affected, we’ll be in touch shortly. Understandably, we’re receiving a lot of calls and messages on social media right now. Thank you for your patience as we deal with customers as quickly as possible in departure date order, with priority given to those due to depart within the next 72 hours.Also check Easyjet and TUI flights, they are flying people back.Edited: 8:11 pm, March 14, 2020 "
No place like home
"We are at Amarilla golf at the moment, jet2 have told us our flight will take us home as planned on the 19th. However the local supermarkets are very empty, and the bars closed for something to eat. No fresh produce on the shelves yesterday in the big mercadona, with many other shelves empty. I strongly recommend that anyone thinking about coming here thinks again, especially if they don’t have pre arranged insurance."
These are the chances ya take travelling while there’s a global pandemic hopefully you get hone safetly
"just been watching the skyline webcams, still quite a few people on los c front wandering around and sat on benches.same at troya just slowly walkingup the road."
"Time for anyone wanting to come back to the uk without a prebooked flight, to start researching available flights. Airlines have stopped flying people out to Spain. They are now going to start flying people home to the UK. Got to do what you are happy with. Time to start thinking seriously about what best suits you and your family. Stay safe and keep well whatever you decide."
"Ivan I dont know which supermarket you have been to but we went shopping this morning to the mercodona in adeje, shelves full of everything including bread, we stocked up with beer as we are here another week !!"
"This is copied from another thread and was also reported on UK Television this morning.*If you are travelling home via the airport bring food with you, as lots of shops are closed!People queueing around the airport for upto an hour to get a drink from the limited places that are open.Huge queues at the vending machines too!Duty free closed obviously along with other shops.Due to delays be prepared for no seats and lots of unease.The good news so far is, I’ve only one hour delay however some people arriving being told there flights are cancelledFollow your airlines advice.Edited: 10:38 am, March 15, 2020 "

"Rescue flights heading for mainland Spain. All hotels in Valencia which includes Benidorm are to closed up within 72 hours. Benidorm is popular with the elderly, hotels full of pensioners of various nationalities, many overwintering longstay. Everyone has to return home. It will be a massive repatriation. This is to comply with the recent state of alert/emergency."
