Hello!I am planning to visit Croatia in May with my husband. Now that the coronavirus has become so big I have read a few articles about anti-asians sentiments in Europe.I live in Laos and never have been to China. No case has been discovered in my country yet. I am concerned that our trip won't go well because we will feel unwelcomed (we are both asians). I only read articles on the web so I don't how is it really going and if racism towards asians is now becoming big or if the media blew it out of proportions.Any advice on this would be very welcome!Thank you in advance.
"Hello,""I only read articles on the web so I don't how is it really going and if racism towards asians is now becoming big or if the media blew it out of proportions.""As usual it is the media how blew out of proportion first the virus and than the reaction to it.There is no racism towards Asians, only some people are afraid to get the virus from Chinese looking people.The worst thing that could happen is that people will move away from you on the bus or the tram and you'll have more space, it's not that bad after all. :-)Honestly, I think the whole thing will be over by May.Edited: 2:58 am, February 07, 2020 "
"Hi,Croatia is safe, due to Coronavirus, especially her islands - Dalmatia.No Coronavirus suffers"
Where did you get that information from? Croatia has documented 18 cases so far.
I agree
Traveling is nice and very important. I have been traveling for over 30 years around the world and something I learned is when you feel uncomfortable about traveling to an specific place do not travel. Is matter of have common sense regarding what is going on in the World at this moment. I just cancelled three different trips I had paid for the first semester of this year and I do not regret for doing it. I would rather to hold my trips until the situation is better.
"Hi , I am currently travelling in Switzerland now. I am from Singapore. It’s true that you will meet some racist peoples if you are yellow skin and looks like Asian. When queing at train station counter, they will stand at least 2 meters from you; When you approach to counter, staff will shut the windows immediately as they think all Chinese are carrying the virus; when you board the public bus, teenagers will shout “coronavirus” and keep coughing at you and shout loudly on some insulting words e.g. chinese = virus etc. They are trying to chase you out from the public transport. So far, this is the situation I met for the past few days. Anyways, there are some good peoples who will ask us whether need any help, some lead us to train station and some asked us to enjoy the view and the trip. For your information."
"I don't think there is any racism here since only last week I was walking with my Chinese friend who resides in Croatia, and nobody was looking at her in a strange way. Few weeks ago it might have been reaction in some western countries.However, with pandemic now everybody will be more cautious and will keep the distance since we are all recomended to do so. Traveling doesnt help stop the pandemic so the strict rules were introduced. Therefore, you should wait until the new measures come and hopefully by May it could be better. Now it is a time to stay at home."
"Hi, I am from Slovenia - a small country near Croatia. We have a house in Croatia on the island Krk. which we rent too. And we can˙t go to Croatia, because the border is closed. There are like in Slovenia all public traffic stopped because of corona. The Zagreb airport is the only airport in Croatia which is opened for now but not yet for a long time.If you can see there is not problem with people from the another continent - the problem is corona.And corona will be unfortunately problem in may too I suppose.Regards, Slavica"

You are kidding yourself if you think this situation will be over in May. Be responsible. No one should be travelling anywhere right now or in the foreseeable future.
"I very much doubt the travel restrictions will be lifted by May, or that Coronavirus will no longer be a problem by then. I really hope I'm wrong, but I'd be very surprised if I am."
"If I were you, due to the crazy way people are reacting world wide to Asians ... I would cancel your trip. Its not worth exposing your selves to possibly the virus but to what ever these fearful people and or racist peoples may do. I am so sorry people become so extreme in their thoughts. Please for your own sakes .. cancel better safe then sorry.Edited: 2:19 pm, March 29, 2020 "
