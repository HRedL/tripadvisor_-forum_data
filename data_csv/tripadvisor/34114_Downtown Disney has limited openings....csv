"Disneyland Hotel, Grand Californian and Paradise Pier Hotels remain closed, as do the theme parks. My daughter is headed to college in a few weeks, so we went to Downtown Disney today to see about getting some items for her dorm. Downtown Disney opens at 10am. The parking lot opens at 9:45. We arrived in the area around 9:30am, and all parking lots were closed and coned off. At about 9:40 the parking lot attendants and police officers removed the cones and we were able to drive into the parking lot and wait for the gates to actually open at 9:45. Parking was free. You approach Downtown Disney the same way as before, but before you get to the security checkpoint you pass through a tent where they take your temperature. The next tent had officers with dogs, not sure what they were sniffing for, but everyone was friendly. Finally you go through the old security checkpoint. There is plexiglass separating you from the cast members. Everyone is wearing a mask. And the ground is well marked with lines 6 feet apart. You keep your party together at all times. For example when we got to the temperature taking tent we were the only ones there, and there were three temperature taking people. They asked us all to go to the same person. So keep your party together.Once into Downtown Disney it felt good to be back. Every planter that has a bench, has social distancing markings on it. So you know where to sit to stay six feet apart from the person ""next"" to you. We went to Starbucks first. And while we were waiting there, we watched the line for ""The Wonderful World of Disney Store"" grow before our eyes. So after we ate we went and got into line. It felt a little like the line for Avatar at the Animal Kingdom in FL. Where the queue crossed walkways and there were lots of cast members directing traffic. We got in line sort of next to the trams. The door you enter is the one across from Starbucks. It took about fifteen minutes to wait to enter the store. Inside the store, the crowd control was good because I did not feel like people were on top of one another. We also shopped at The Dress Shop, The Home Store, Wonderground and Sugarboo. Each store has a cast member at the door. They limit the number of people in the store and you wait in line outside to enter, lining up along the markings on the ground that indicate six feet distance. Other than the Wonderful World of Disney Store, the only other store we really had to wait for was the Home Store. Everything else we either were able to walk right in, or we just had to wait for 3 people to exit. The Lego Store had a line too. We ordered Black Tap Burgers to go for lunch, came home and ate it, and it was pretty good even with the travel (we live fifteen minutes from Disneyland). So it was a nice way to spend the morning. We've had annual passes since 1995 and my daughter is headed out of state for college. We thought we were going to spend a lot of time at Disneyland this summer, like every summer. But that will have to wait. This was a nice way for us to spend some time getting ready to send her off. I don't think it's quite time yet to plan an Anaheim vacation. But if you live near by, it's not a bad way to spend a few hours; outside, socially distanced, with masks, and basking in the Disney Way of Crowd Management and Hospitality."
Thanks for your delightful report and what to expect this year at Downtown Disney.
CDC has Disneyland as high risk for SARS-CoV-2 so I'll pass. Thank you though.
"Thanks for taking the time to give a detailed report. I can’t believe Disneyland is still closed with no end in sight for opening up. Until then, I live through those posting trip reports for Disneyland Paris and DisneyWorld. LolGlad you enjoyed your day out!"
"""Don't know what the dogs were sniffing for""They've probably had bomb threats from crazy Disney fanatics demanding that they open Disneyland at once, because the pandemic is just an elaborate hoax."
"I have read that they are training dogs to detect covid. But you’re right, could be drugs, weapons or something else."
"The dogs were there before but only on the Harbor entrance. They were in the walkways inside the resort as you enter before getting to the security tents. I've passed by them there before. I suppose they have such a keen sense of smell that having dozens of people pass around them in that area was still useful. Now because there is only one entrance to the resort grounds and there needs to be other protocols in place the dogs are kept more contained.Edited: 10:44 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Bruinred interesting side note, in France they have so far had 100% success rate with the dogs, here in Australia they have started training them too.I believe it is so eventually sometime next year we can look at opening up our International Borders again and using them at the Airport to ""sniff"" out the covid infected and send them back before entering."
"Thanks for the update, sure miss Disneyland. :("
