"Hello, I m trying to still work my entry into Croatia from USA and would like to spend time in Split and Hvar, June 30th -Mid July. Will a USA citizen be required to quarantine upon check-in of hotel or Apartment for 14 days?? Is there a website that gives updated information? It appears Countries are giving out information at the 1st, 15th,and 30th of the month. Thanks for any help"
Here is the EU travel site ... All EU countries information + maphttps://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-e…
"Croatia has barred admission to all travelers except Croatian citizens, foreign national residents returning home, foreign citizens owning a property or their close family members if they can prove relation, essential workers, and others with legitimate travel needs on a case by case basis. This entrance restriction is currently in effect through 15th of June. There might be an exception on foreigners holding Slovenian citizenship, but nothing yet is official. I expect any time soon an official statement on tourism. Under what condition tourists can enter Croatia. Will they be allowed to leave the region of accommodation, will they allow them to stay on the islands, what about multiply bookings etc. Some of mine guests stay at our house in Makarska and then head to our another house on the island of Korcula.Tourist from outside of EU is another question. As of today nothing has changed . The European Union has closed its borders till further notice to all non-European Union residents."

"My guests were turned away at the border this morning. I just phones people who operate hotel. It's news to them. I phoned MUP earlier today, they told me who told you tourists can enter?The only ones entering are foreign citizens owning a property or boat in Croatia.Edited: 4:16 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"Yes, thousands of ""tourists"" who are mainly property owners, and now Slovenes. Others can, if holding a valid HOTEL booking for business purposes, not pleasure. I was in touch today with MUP regarding my Hungarian guests who were denied entrance. Tourists for please staying in private homes or hotels cannot enter. Apparently not before 15th of June unless our politicians change the date. Only those who booked a hotel room and their nature of visit is business can enter. They actually need to write an e-mail to Uprava za granicu, and explain the nature of visit. My reference is MUP."
"Still I doubt they look at a booking of an accommodation as business trip. You are totally ignoring the fact that my guests were denied entrance despite having a valid booking. They were coming to Croatia as tourists, pleasure reasons not a business trip."
"Well DO IT! The sad part is you are the one telling people that a business trip is simple booking of accommodation. Here read: https:/…2184263.aspx I hope you do understand Croatian! So according to you the border is open completely for tourists but according to minister of Tourism it, ain't yet!"
