Sister 4B please can you add a link to the source of this? People can then check for themselves and we avoid the rumours.

Thanks vip and sister 4b.Gutted!
I’ll update that when I can. Just hearing from friends that work in the industry. It’s heartbreaking for them.

"Ha well said sister4B thanks and wish you well too .... enjoy the music, love it too especially halay!"
"I am getting pictures from staff I know in turkey of bars and hotels closed. Messages on what’s app about how bad it is there and how worries they are over livelyhoods I had a phone call from one staff member today asking how things where in england, he is also worried, he has a family of 2 kids, is wife, his mum and his sister to look after and feed and he has lost in income for a the bare minimum 1 months. I then look on the Costa del sol forum ( I was due to go there in April ) and there are people there kicking of because they have been able to cancel there flights but can’t get there money back for extra leg room seats. What’s that ? £50 or £100 ? What about all the people losing there jobs, the people who won’t be able to feed there families It annoys me that even in these desperate times all some people think about is themselves It looks like I will lose 2 of my holidays and yes of course I am sad about that but there are more important things in life. I really hope this does not go on to long and people can get back to work and earn a living.Edited: 5:41 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Absolutely....As disappointing as losing a holiday is, it’s nothing compared to losing your business, livelihood or even worse a loved one. It’s time to look at the bigger picture."
"I agree totally eagle. Well said. This crisis has brought out the worst in many people, you only have to look at the empty shelves in the shops the total disregard for others, just as long as they’re alright blow everyone else. So many selfish people around, it absolutely sickens me. What impressed me in the Turkish newspaper vipfamily gave the link for, was how the report brought out the respect and caring nature the Turkish people have. I have seen it myself when l have been there, just as you will have done , they're such lovely people, and so many families have very little, materially. It’s very sad for your Turkish friend, and so many others in the same situation. There’s going to be a lot of real hardship through this and it will be in lots of countries including Turkey. To some extent it will affect us all, but some much worse than others. As you so rightly say we have only lost a holiday.... we will live. Many people over there stand to lose so much more. It’s really upsetting."
"I totally agree. If the only thing you have to worry about is a missed holiday then you’re very lucky. I’ve heard of the seasonal airport staff taken on a few days ago getting the sack today. More permanent staff are being told they have to take their holiday days and believe me in Turkey these are very few. All have rent to pay, families to feed etc.So although missing a holiday is disappointing there are those far more affected by this. Remember as well that free healthcare in Turkey is dependent on your contributions into the system so no pay, no insurance contributions....."
"Heartbreaking . I really feel for them, there’s nothing worse than having to worry over how you will look after your family and pay the bills, it’s a terrible situation to be in. l hope they will get some help from the Turkish authorities with this because no one deserved to be landed in such a mess."
"Yes people need help but It’s not just Turkey , it’s spain, England , France Nearly every country in the world. Governments can only help so much before the money runs out.It’s time to do what Greece did durning the financial crisis and tax the rich with a one of taxAnyone with 100k in the bank pay 1% tax, 200k 2% tax 300k 3% tax 1mill 10% tax and so on. This is the only way to get out of all this messThe rich can afford to pay this one of tax and then it will help governments around the world help the ones in need of help. But it would take all the governments in the world to agree to ‘‘tis other wise the rich would move the money to banks in countries that did not support a one of tax"
"Brilliant logical and common sense idea eagle, but the mega rich are a law unto themselves, this is why there’s so much inequality. The rich get richer through greed, and fairness doesn’t enter the equation for many. Sadly, because this would be a solution."
Maybe we should tax golfers Eagle...they're obviously rich.LOL.
"An additional taxation of the super wealthy is not the answer and is simply penalising some people for having succeeded further than others.Besides, the wealthiest probably have the bulk of their money tied up in investments, ownership, stocks & shares etc I'd be surprised if many people have more than £85k sitting in an account with any one banking institution due to the limits on FSCS protection."
"Asif I consider myself to be a Capitalist and under normaly circumstances I would totally agree people should not be penalised for being successful. But these are NOT normal Circumstances. You can’t tell me a billionaire does not have 100 million sitting in cash. Or that a millionaire does not have a 100k sitting in the bank. Shares where the person has a huge amount of them can also be taxed. There are going to be people losing there houses, living on the streets, can’t feed there families and it’s time the rich are MADE to put there hands in there pockets Andy I am definitely not a rich golfer lol and this virus is going to hit my income hard and I expect it may take me years to get back to where I was before this virus. But I still consider my self lucky to at least I have a income. but I would pay a tax to play golf in turkey if it went to them that have lost there jobs and struggling"
"Thank you eagle. A real and heartfelt comment and many of us will agree. This is no time for anyone to be cynical and make cracks about golf players. My sympathy lies with those who stand to lose all they have worked for. Life in Turkey isn’t easy for the many who are working hard for their families to survive. We do live in a selfish and greedy society, sadly."
"Are you the same Josephine who just a few days ago was in denial about this whole situation , and claimed it was all over-reaction and media hype?"
PS Yes parts of the media are still in a state hysteria about it... can’t read the papers anymore. I stick by that.

Interesting read Tim.Thanks.
Thank you Tim for this helpful response.
Is there a link to the original source of this information please? Which Princess of Wales Hospital is it supposed to have originated from?
"Please scroll down to:‘If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, then you don't have the virus'https:/…Please remove your post Tim as it is fake news and this thread was intended to have verified links."
"I’ve had the same msg emailed to me by well meaning people a number of times, with claims it has come from various sources..... BUT there have been many doctors talking about these information emails being sent around , and have said there is absolutely no evidence that drinking water, sitting in the sun or that any of the other things suggested will kill the virus or prevent you catching it. If it was prevented or cured that easy do you really think the world would be in the state it is now? And as for symptoms like a runny nose or being able to hold your breathe proving you haven’t got it, well that’s been discredited too. Stay inside your own home , keep at a distance of 2 meters from those who live outside your home if you have to go out, and wash your hands thoroughly as often as possible.And stop believing random advice that people forward you online.Check the NHS website if you need advice."
I’m afraid so Josephine. There’s a lot of these doing the rounds. We’d all love to believe there’s a simple way to keep safe but things like this are now proved to be dangerous as they’ve given people a false sense of security.Hopefully it will get taken down.
This is quite good as well from Which and is also requesting reporting of the fake newshttps:/…We all want to avoid this virus. Best to take advice from WHO or the NHS. Hope everyone is safe.
"And there’s people suffering and dying in agony from this horrible illness right now. l am saddened Tim is posting spam on an open forum.  Most people don’t understand this virus properly and will fall for it... l admit l did, and others may do as well. Tim if you return here please delete this post. Shocked at fake info being allowed, what is happening on here ??"
"Here's a useful guide on what steps to take, where to go, etc if you believe you may be suffering from the coronavirus in Turkey, basically a translation of some of the flowcharts from the government's website:https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/a-guide-on…"
It was shared in good faith and indeed shared with me by a friend who works in the health service who also thought it was genuine. She sent it to every contact in her book. I have removed the post.
Hi Tim is did sound plausible - I think people are unfair having a go at you for a simple mistake.Glad to hear your mum is keeping well. I also don’t think you would have travelled to Turkey had you felt at risk but again an easy target. You have to much respect for your friends out there. Also you would have surely been detected on your arrival with the checks in place.
"The advice given in that abominable piece of spam was never plausible. This is a viral infection not a bacterial one. This is why I had asked for any advice, news etc to be backed up by an evidence based or original source. Apparently every institution from the NHS to Stanford University has a member of staff altruistically sharing advice given to health professionals who would have the time to do this?? Unfortunately working in the health service does not make anyone immune to gullibility. Please everyone do check the validity of anything you are sent unless from a .gov or similar.Edited: 6:58 am, March 25, 2020 "
Good advice vip. I just had a whatsapp one forwarded by a family member. Repeated your warning from yesterday. As you say many NHS workers don’t know anything more than the rest of us regarding this.
ok ok ok ok.. no need to hang the guy for making an honest mistake. Not everyone here is whiter that white although without our holidays we are a bit. And not all of us are doctors.
So it’s OK he travelled on an plane while admittedly suppressing a cough?! Bet you’re relieved story weren’t on that flight!The fake news mongers are doing very well on their own without it being perpetuated here!! The post has been removed now so no need to drag it up really is there?
"Hi VIP,Do you mean plane out of the UK or in to the UK?Yes Tim removed it soon as he could. I just think all the hysteria and hype was a bit of an over reaction. Sorry if I upset you, I didn't mean to."
Back to the UK. Apology accepted although I wasn’t overly upset as there’s far worse stuff out there just now to worry about. Hope you and your family are all safe.
