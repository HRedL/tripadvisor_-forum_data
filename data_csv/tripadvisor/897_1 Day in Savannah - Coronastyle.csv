"I'll be driving through Savannah with a crazy little crew of 3 moms and 7 kids (4 - 9 years old) and a teenager. We are getting in around 3pm and heading off the next day latest 2pm. Nobody wants to get sick, especially away from home so we plan on being extra cautious. For dinner is there an outdoor restaurant you'd recommend that would be great for kids but still feel like we are experiencing iconic Savannah? Anything with a breeze? Am I asking for too much lol? Will we need reservations for a Wednesday night outside? Maybe we get something to go and go sit in one of the squares? Or overlooking the river?Figured we'd grab an ice cream from Leopold's.Is there a ghost tour that would be appropriate for kids? Maybe with 11 people we could get our own guide and he could tame it down? Idk how many people are usually in a ghost tour usually. Next morning we'll get breakfast at the Clary? Or maybe a more grab and go plan. Open to ideas of anything else outdoorsy before we drive off to Asheville.Thanks!!"
Vinnie's for pizza.Check Dirk with Savannah Rambles for a tour.Clary's for breakfast sounds good.
We are staying at River Street Inn right on the river for a very reasonable price. Very clean and CDC COVID-19 guidelines being followed.
