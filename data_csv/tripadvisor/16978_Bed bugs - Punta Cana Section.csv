Is there a hotel ''bed bugs'' free. I am afraid of having to bring them back home.......
"Hi,What is bed bug free today might be bed bug ridden next week.There is no way of predicting how and when these critters show up.Overall it is nit a huge problem in Punt Cana but there are occasional 'outbreaks' .It is very hard for hotels to prevent it. it is not so straight forward that a clean hotel will not get bed bugs. It is a world wide problem that is hard to tackle as people travel a lot and take them with them.I would not worry about it too much if I was you. Book the resort that you fancy the most and keep track of reviews on there. If close to your arrival many reviews start mentioning it than switch. Not much more you can do than that.Forget about them and book the nicest place you can find!Amy"

"Hotels don't have Bed Bugs! People do and bring them to the Hotels. Always a worry with travel, even locally."
Punta Cana section of what? The country?
especially locally. Try staying in NYC where there is an epidemic!
