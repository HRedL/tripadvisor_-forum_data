"You are correct, many won't want to return for a while. As staffing needs will be less, the number who do choose to come back will offset this. I've seen people say how much they were afraid to go back to work, and then once they got there, realized how much better and normal they felt. You keep living inside your head worrying all the time, it just makes things worse."
Yes. The media has done well with horrifying ppl at home who aren't sick and dont know anyone who is. They will continue to be afraid until the country opens and they go out to more than the market or liquor store.
"Tina, please remind me who set a date of April 15, then changed it to May 1 for the stay at home order?..I will await your reply"
The people who haven’t been paid for 45 days want to go back. It’s the ones who are still getting paid by their employer or who are collecting unemployment that are taking a stand about not going back.
Super glad for you that you don’t know anyone who is sick. Why should YOU worry about tens of thousands people dying as long as you don’t know them?
"Blue, the next thing is the Murder Hornets not the hurricane season. 10 years of isolate and full body armor or you have a 99.9% chance of not getting stung but if you do you might die! Can't have that"
Hmmm money or life. Hard choice I guess for some.
It’s disheartening to see how many people are blinded by their ignorance and frustration regarding this pandemic. Thankfully they aren’t the ones in charge of making decisions for the benefit of the public at large.
"As long as travel is restricted, most of them won't have a choice in the matter.Locals casinos and bars will re-open far before some strip casinos.TSA screenings are down about 93% from last year.For Las Vegas, this is going to make 2008-2009 look like the good old days."
"Our employees are volunteering to come in to work, there is no business so no work, they find work to do. Just few hours and few workers each time. On few occasions when we had special tasks, by calls, one or more showed up in 15-20 minutes. Get the task done and leave. Not to impress the bosses, senior employees with keys went to work and left without informing me. They are bored at home, they are anxious to do something, they are industrious and dedicated. No lazy bums here. Even at normal time, there is lots of spaces, we don’t gather in confined groups. No hugging no kissing. They all wear mask without any management demands."
This virus is real. I know 2 people including the super of my bulding who died from it. I suspect the states that rushed to open early against medical advice will see a spike in cases and deaths.
Union!
"I saw a California Coronavirus map yesterday, 1/4 of the northern part of California has no case. New York messed up big time, but not the entire country. No one say this Coronavirus is fake, no need to jump up and down to scream 1,000 times, fighting the windmills. It’s a big country, 1/3 of the American counties have no Coronavirus case. We don’t live in the same America."
It is a very good thing parts of America have no Covid 19. Let's keep it that way. Rural communities are not set up to deal with that many cases. What will all the nay sayers say when the rural communities start to be infected? Maybe the same ones who said this was no worse than the flu. It feels like a loop from the twilight zone..
"The fear of returning to work is real because the threat of contagion is real. I know people who have been affected by this, but even if I didn't I wouldn't irresponsibly write this virus off as imaginary in people's minds.Data, science and facts aren't sexy nor easy to relate to in everyday living, but if you look at how it's applied in industry, say the airlines, you'll see how important they are for policy and decision-making. No one who is sane will dispute the fact that a plane can only bear a certain amount of weight before it becomes dangerous for everyone on board. Anyone who protests and hold signs demanding the airlines to lift weight restrictions would be laughed off, yet the equivalent of those people shouting to ignore pandemic facts are looked at as reasonable people. They are not, and their opinions and resulting actions can and have proven deadly."
"The death rate is well under 1%, And of those 1 % 90 % are either elderly or some younger that had underlying conditions. 30-40 thousand die from the flu each year, I guess we better start shutting down the country every flu season. All these people saying opening up will spike, sorry hasn't happened. Georgia everyone predicted huge spike yet nothing. Just stay in a bubble if you are to scared."
"If you disagree with reopening, you can stay home. You have a choice, you have freedom."
"@normalD I would take your comments more seriously if it's not something I see and hear repeated every night on a network not worth mentioning. You think the contagiousness, symptoms, and death rates are flu-like, then stand by your conviction and talk to an actual front line worker and get their take on it. Or better yet, face time with family who's on the verge of death who's had seasonal flu and was as healthy as a 47 year old can be. I have. And that is why I cannot stand the kind of opinion and nonsense that you are happily parroting. Educate yourself or just shut it."
"Why are people so intent on closing the little bookstore or coffee shops in Clear Lake or Weed California? Or in the middle of nowhere in the farm country? What did they do to you to make you so intent on destroying them? People only see around their home and think the entire country is like their hometown. They look in the mirror and think everyone looks and think just like him. Not a matter of right or wrong, maybe we are all right, we just think and live differently. You can’t call everyone who don’t agree with you stupid, maybe it is you."
"@ Mac you misunderstood my position. I don't have to explain myself, but I've read your previous posts and I do get the sense that you are a responsible person who care for your employees and community. My head is not in the sand and I agree with controlled and targeted reopening. Indefinite closure is not tenable for anyone, least of all small businesses that are key to regaining economic growth. My family has a small business as well. However, I use data and facts to inform my opinions and am not afraid to challenge my belief if reality is to the contrary. What gets my goat are irresponsible comments that are both baseless and idiotic, casually minimizing the severity of this virus. It is not like the flu and any comparison is like apples to iphones."
"Thanks, I wasn’t speaking about you or anyone specifically. Maybe we are all right, doesn’t need to be right or wrong, black or white, open or close. There are many middle grounds for all of us. Dealers on the Strip is the envy of LV workers, you need to work in far away small casinos for many years, if you are good and lucky, maybe you get to downtown casinos, only the best or with connections maybe get to work on the Strip. Those refuse to work open the doors for 1,000s eager dealers and staff waiting for the chances to move up."
"To have 1000’s of eager dealers waiting to work, you need tens of thousands of visitors, and that won’t be happening anytime soon."
"We can go to a crowded Lowes or walmart, but no camping or golfing"
"Its a case of being smart, the virus is real, there are works arounds. For some people the choice is, do i eat, lose my house, my car, stay in a depressed state or go back to work smartly and safely."
"""any comparison is like apples to iphones"" Er, Ive got an apple iphone!"
"It’s a food chain, you move up step by step. Looking back in our lives, we did exactly the same thing. Every time someone retire or quit, 10 applicants aim for that position. One waits for that opening to move up. If you want to leave the graveyard shift, you wait for someone to leave. You want a better job near home, this maybe the chance. You’d be thrilled if others refuse to come back to work. We are going to miss you, please don’t come back. Take Me! Take Me!"
