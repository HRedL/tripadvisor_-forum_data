I wanted to know some info and tips about staying in the St Germain district please.
It is a great neighborhood!
You’re referring to the 6th Arridissoment (area 6)…Couple of links that will provide loads of information:…wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Parishttp://www.tripadvisor.com/SearchForums?ff=14&geo=187147&scope=2&q=area+6&returnTo=%2FShowForum-g187147-i14-Paris_Ile_de_France.htmlPeople will have personal favorites...Area 6 is my personal favorite.
"Stayed there (Le Regent Hotel, Rue Dauphine, just off St Germain) in late October. It was my first tirp to Paris. I loved the area! Facinating little side streets to explore; great Metro access. The perfect cafe on every block. Go for it!!!!"
"The St. Germain area is definitely my favorite area of Paris. For me, it combines everything I need - great location (near Luxembourg, Seine, Odeon metro stop), shopping, great cafes, and great restaurants. My husband and I have stayed at three hotels, the Dauphine, the Hotel Relais St. Germain (favorite), and the Hotel Jardin de l'Odeon. We stayed there in October, and arrived the second day of the transportation strike, yet were able to walk everywhere we wanted from this location. We didn't have to walk, but we like the exercise and the sites. It would take a lot to get me to stay in another area."
"I stayed there on my 5th visit to Paris, my 6th visit and will stay there on my next visit !"
"The neighborhoods of the 6eme-Saint Germain des Prés arrondissement are among the most interesting--both day and night--of any area in Paris. These neighborhoods offer a healthy '..mix..' of local Parisian residents, workers, students, shop and business workers, tourists, etc. Perhaps because of this constant activity, it is also one of the safest--in fact as well as perception--areas of Paris for strolling / walking at almost any time of day or night. These neighborhoods are convenient---within easy strolling / walking distances of a great many of Paris' best sites and attraction and have excellent public transportation connections to '..everywhere else..' in Paris--Metro, RER & bus--to and other interesting neighborhoods, sights and attractions. There are more than enough interesting local attractions and sights to keep you well occupied, more than enough good local restaurants, bistros and cafés to suit almost any taste appetitie or budget; more than enough interesting shopping opportunities to max-out all but AMEX 'black'...and all this within easy strolling / walking distances of most addresses in the 6eme. In addition to this, the neighborhoods of the 6eme '..flow..' almost seamlessly along the Seine into other interesting neighborhoods of the 5eme--Latin Quarter, 4eme--Iles / ower-Marais, 1er--Louvre / Tuileries.If these neighborhoods of the 6eme--Saint Germain des Prés have a '..flaw..'...it is that there is so much to see and do right there, that you may be reluctant to leave and visit all of the other wonderful places and things in '..the rest of Paris..'."
"A local' s slightly different point of view on Saint-Germain :  This is now the most expensive neighbourhood in Paris, with the most expensive real estate anyway. With its extreme gentrification, it has changed much in character and, in my opinion, lost in diversity and interest, the most recent feature being the invasion of the neighbourhood by the upmarket international fashion brands, especially around the rue du Four . Foreigners acount for about 30 % of property transactions there.  The prospective visitor must know what to expect in Saint-Germain nowadays :  - between the boulevard Saint-Germain and the Seine : expensive home decoration shops, art galleries, high end antiques, which will leave the visitor little else to do at night than admiring magnificent antiques and expensive home fabrics behind iron curtains,  - west of the neighbourhood, along the boulevard Raspail and boulevard Saint-Germain : high-end modern design, with in particular Italian and German kitchen and bathroom fittings,  - the famous cafes and brasseries along the boulevard are now largely tourist establishments, which has consequences on prices and service. The visitor will be most likely to pay 7-8 Euros for his/her favorite soda while rubbing shoulders with groups of Japanese ""office ladies"" on a ""shop-till-you-drop"" whirlwind tour of Europe. Some establishments segregate regulars and tourists,   - the section with still retains some diversity is the one that borders the Latin quarter, around Odéon and Mabillon. However the rue de Buci is now what I would call ""semi-touristic"" (sandwich shops, etc)  I know that SG is worshipped by many. However the place is hardly a good value and, in my view, gives the visitor a sanitised, distorted idea of Paris. "
"Trudain,Lots of good thougts. How do you feel about the Latin Quarter? Thanks"
"I find it to be very crowded and tend to avoid, other than possibly for some restaurants on occasion. But it's probably very attractive to first-time visitors and is convenient for sight-seeing."
"To Cmaggie :On the ""Latin Quarter"", much depends on the area you are refering to. The area along the river, with the Greek restaurants, between the boulevard Saint-Germain and the Seine, around the rue de la Huchette, and Saint-Severin (which by the way is hardly the LQ strictly speaking) is absolutely awful : crowded noisy little streets, hawkers, ground sticky with food, etc.Away from the river, up the hill to the Pantheon, south and east of the Pantheon, you'll basically find gentrified quiet neighbourhoods, with more animation along the boulevard Saint-Michel, where most businesses cater to a student clientele (mid-range fashion, sandwich and fast-food places).Among the touristy central neighbourhoods, the Marais, which has not yet totally undergone the sterilisation seen in Saint-Germain, remains the most diverse, and, in my opinion, the most interesting area to stay for a visitor. "
"Dear Gymbunni63:While Trudaine is unquestionably right re St. Germain des Pres, I still love it. I am one of those people who like looking at high end antiques. I stayed at the Hotel Verneuil, which may technically not be in the 6th, but close enough, and spent many happy evenings walking around looking at the lovely things in the windows. I'm not big on night life, so this was a good way to spend the evenings-exercise, and cheap, not to say free, entertainment. I always feel safe here, and there is still much to see and do, plus it is very convenient to most tourist sights. My favorite streets are the Rue Jacob and the Place Furstemburg (sp?) IMO not to be missed is Delacroix's (sp?) studio. Also, one of my favorite chocolatiers (whose name currently escapes me-but I know where to find it) is on the Rue St. Peres, just a few blocks up from the Faculty of Medicine.Bon chance and bon voyage!"
"Berkeley, I do like Debauve et Gallais too, the chocolatier you speak about, 30 rue des Saint Pères.I am totally with you, even if I understand what Trudaine means, as I miss the 60s drugstore too (Armani store now!) and the ancient Saint Germain spirit. But I still like the art galleries rue de Seine, may be the district close to Les Beaux Arts is still a lively one, due to students, don't you think Trudaine ? The café in front of the Beaux-Arts is one of my favourite meeting place, especially in summer.I like place de Furstemberg and Delacroix museum too, that is not well known, not many tourists there. "
"Hi Only-Lyon,Yes, that is the Chocolatier I am referring to. Their windows are almost as delicious as their chocolates!Merci bien."
"I agree with Trudaine, and in fact thought he put it very well, in his assesment of the Latin Quarter, specifically area near river. Kind of yech, but, for a first time visitor a fun place to wander through( unless one is fearful of crowds, LOL) . I would never stay in that area though. I did stay in the 5th and enjoyed it though, but the east end of it, past Luxembourg Park. But, my favorite is still the 6th, St Germain, I stayed on Rue Dauphine , at same hotel as MeMe( Hotel Le Regent) and there were lots of cafes and even a little market in the area, but, I do agree it was a bit quieter in the surrounding areas in the evening as many of the galleries and shops closed. I did not see this as a bad thing though as I have also stayed in the first (1st, Lourve) where every evening the shops along the Rue Du Rivoli stay open to sell you T shirts, Eiffel Tower key chains, and canned pate, a bit overwhelming and tacky at the same time. LOL "
"I did not focus on St-Germain back in the day, not until a friend - who sees the beauty in everything, whose favorite place it is - showed me around a couple of years ago. The church's history fascinates me.So this is a serious, if idle, question: What was the neighborhood like before it got to be the way it is now? I don't mean in all its incarnations. Just the last one that you remember, when it was ""good""? Thanks!"
"*Bump* because... Trudaine, travelnutty, only-lyon and/or joan1, the way you talk, I really am interested in what it was like before. (I've read the ""ancient"" history of the abbey, place and neighborhood, but what about not-so-ancient? I also googled upon an account of what happened in the district during the riots in 1968, but that's not what I mean, of course.) Thanks."
St. Germain is a fantastic neighborhood; we have found ourselves going back to the hood time and time again for dinner. 
"Firewind, can't help you with what it was like ""before"" , I am only middle aged, not stoneaged,.LOL . My personal experiences with the area only go back about 10 years. "
"joan1, thanks for answering. Just wondering what people remember about this very special neighborhood, that I can ponder when I'm there next month. (As I indicated, I have photos of the 1968 riots, so it will be interesting to align them with what's there now.) Idle as can be, not the kind of thing experts tend to dwell on, I know..."
"My memory of SGdP 23+ years ago is similar to my memory of the Marais of as recently as 5 years ago. Tourism wasn't the primary driver of the local economy.There were dozens of small art galleries occupied by struggling artists, far more local food stores (boulangeries on every corner, a boucher on every other block). A true ""neighborhood"" feel with parks full of Parisians and their kids, wine barrels on the sidewalks outside bistros where locals stood around them to sip wine and talk politics after work (almost non-existent now but common then), and no commercial tourist magnets (like fashion stores and designer shops) to speak of. Prices for everything was in line with anywhere else in Paris, cheaper if anything (the Champs Elysée has always been exception). There wasn't a sandwich shop every 50 feet, pizza wasn't the predominant fast food, crepes weren't fast food at all, the brasseries, even places like le Deux Magots, were all in roughly the same price range and filled with locals (with maybe a few American Hemingway fans sprinkled in). Almost no presence of supermarkets, you shopped at the greengrocer, boucher, boulanger when you needed food. There were storefronts for plumbers, electricians, shoe repairmen, carpenters on every commercial block, and of course, NO STARBUCKS! Nowadays, whenever I recommend the 6th on TA, I think to myself, are we doing to the 6th what Rick Steves singlehandedly did to rue Cler in the 7th?I completely agree with Trudaine."
"SGdP used to be a hippy hang out. Cool and relaxed. The Stones would come to this neighborhood to chill after staying a week at the Crillon on the rive droite. Crusty and old for the most part and ot at all chic. There is still tons of the old character left. The ivory carver on the rue Bonaparte, many book binders, a poet's restaurant, and the local scene at the smoky cafe bars where few tourist dare enter."
"metromole, phread, thank you!"
"Firewind - if you're REALLY curious about the 6th, an interesting read is ""Into a Paris Quartier"" by Diane Johnson. Lots of insider information. "
Thank you keylimejet. I'll look for it. There really is more to this that doesn't rise to the level of this thread...
"As a student here arriving 3 days before 9-11 and staying the course of a year, I found myself at the Canadian bar and a small ""Irish Pub"" called Coolin in the collonade mall-looking square building with lots of shops in it. These were fun, chill spots about 5 years ago."

"I have read reviews of hotels and apts saying that they got bed bugs from a place on rue de St. Peres in the St. Germain des Pres area. I have also read reviews that some buildings on rue Mazarine have plumbing problems due to the age of the buildings. I know that Paris is an old city and that such smells and pests are likely to be prevalent but having experienced bed bugs (*Shudder*) and gotten rid of them after 2 long and tiring years, I really don't want to bring them back to my place again. Can anyone comment about the so-called European bed bug epidemic and drainage - specifically in the ST. Germain des Pres - rue de Seine area? I am very sensitive to smells and have bad allergies. Thanks."
I really do not believe there is a bedbug epidemic in St. Germain des Pres. As for the plumbing problems it's a common thing in old buildings anywhere.
"I think that denying there is a problem is wrong and is not fair to others who may not have experienced or are not aware how horrible and long-lasting an experience with bed bugs can be. If you can read a bit of French and do a search using ""Paris"" and ""punaises de lit"" (which is the French word for bed bugs) then you can see from user forums that there are people living in Paris and other parts of France suffering from these hardy and age old critters. I understand that this kind of problem is not a great endorsement for any city to officially acknowledge because it hurts tourism, trade but at least acknowledge that it does exist so that people can prepare themselves. Here are some tips I will be following before, during and after I come back from Paris...but I hope that people do their own research before going so that they know how to better prepare themselves if they are unlucky enough to run into this problem. When you enter a hotel/apartment room, never put your suitcase on the mattress right away. Leave it in the hallway. Before unpacking or doing anything else, pull back the sheets on bed carefully and inspect the mattress especially along the seams. If you see any black spots (fecal matter) or bugs or eggs this is a very bad sign of a serious infestation. Demand another room immediately - ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR AS FAR AWAY as possible from this room or if you are really paranoid, just go to another hotel. Do your inspection again for each new room you try. Chances are that if one room is infested, the others surrounding are as well. If you ever experience mosquito-like bites during your trip, investigate the source! It's very hard to find bed bugs during the day if it's only a light infestation. Do your research on hotels and apartments online to see if other people have experienced bed bugs. Avoid rooms/apts with old wood flooring with lots of cracks, carpeting, drapery touching floor, etc. All easy harborage sites for bed bugs which make them incredibly hard to exterminate by apartment and hotel owners/managers. Before you go, inside your suitcase, pack all your stuff inside large ziploc bags for your clothes. Never put your suitcase on a mattress or near any bed. Avoid putting it inside a closet. I store mine in a garbage bag just in case at all times. Even if you were not exposed to bed bugs during your trip, there is always the possibility of catching them on plane flight back via your clothes (seats) or suitcase (in cabin, during transit, etc.) Airport staff have reported getting infestations due to work. That should tell you something. Have a change your clothes ready when you come back. Change into them and discard travel clothes outside the home. Maybe change at the airport bathroom when you arrive. Put the travel clothes in a sealed bag. After you get home, leave your suitcase outside for 2 weeks when weather is consistently cold (pls do your research on temps that will kill bed bugs). Put your ziploc bags full of your clothing into garbage bags while you are outside. Then bring the garbage bags into your laundry room and very carefully dump the contents directly into your washing machine. Wash on HOT. Then rinse with COLD and finally kill the buggers in the dryer on HOT. If you have alot of delicates, its up to you to decide how to deal with those. I would not advise drycleaning since you never know if they're infested either (yes, I'm paranoid) and ethically it's not nice to infest them. When I look for accommodations now, I look for stainless steel, plastic and leather furnishings. Polished concrete floors and tile are best but new wood laminte floors is better than older floors with cracks for bugs to hide in. Carpeting is the worst. I hope this basic information is helpful for you and your loved ones and friends but please do more research on preparation. There are alot of resources on the net. "
