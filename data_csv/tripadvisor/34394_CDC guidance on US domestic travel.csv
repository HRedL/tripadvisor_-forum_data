Just fyi CDC took the unusual step of issuing domestic guidance. Said it is due to community transmission including during and after travel. Might want to keep an eye on that.https:/â€¦travel-in-the-us.html
"Mahalo, Honu!At this point, the majority of the cases tested positive here in Hawaii have been tourists. I hope that people will decide to postpone their trips to Hawaii and choose not to take a chance of bringing COVID-19 to our islands, which have an incredibly fragile health care system.Edited: 3:05 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I think the language here is far too vague. It's reminiscent of the parent who's too timid to flat-out say ""No"" to his child. I realize the CDC can't ""say no"", e.g. disallow travel. Just noting that much of the guidance issued comes across as soft-pedaling, or mixed messages. Take Fauci's comments earlier today. He'd like to see aggressive measures like a 14-day national shutdown...but domestic travel bans won't be needed any time soon. That's akin to our schools & libraries closing, while movie theaters & malls are open. (Public versus private sector, of course...)~ ColleenEdited: 4:15 pm, March 15, 2020 "
