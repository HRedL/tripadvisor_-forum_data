"Hi,is there coronavirus in zanzibar."
Yes.
Yes
Whats the current situation for Covid 19? we are to come in Sept 2020. Whats the Hotels like? how are they running in terms of buffets and general operation of day to day?
"September will be ok according how the situation is going on about hotel I would suggest go haftboard, get more time to enjoy local cuisine"
"I doubt that we will be back to normal by September. Covid-19 appeared here 3 months after Europe. Many people here ignore the ""stay at home"" policy, daladalas to town are crowded! Most hotels are closed. They hope that by December/January we will be back to normal. There are no official reports on people infected/dead since President Magufuli of Tanzania prohibited reports ""to avoid panic""."
"piratepirate,""we have postponed our trip till May 2021""Have some time off, your daily repetition of oh i cancelled my trip is flooding the forum with dizziness,Lets face the truth, the warning signs go back to 2005, Anyones infrastructure in place was inadequate in various ways and waiting to be exposed, Thanks to Italy for a 1st promising vaccine,The corruption, under covid-19, between hospitals and health insurance is cash for cashless,Coronavirus has highlighted regions with higher age population, and wealthy but unhealthy populations,Scientists, researchers and medics have opposing opinions on keeping immune up for different groups of people,We also see the alarming side effects of loss of freedom, its adding to negative statistics,And please take some tips from dr judy mikovits on youtube,On another recent post you also suggested Africa inadequate medically,But is there anyone far and wide winning with covid-19 ?We might be soon singing songs for Africa, after an African nation has developed a promising corona cure.Edited: 2:22 pm, May 07, 2020 "
@piratepirate Bina is a permanently angry and ‘offended’ individual who posts confrontational and unhelpful responses. Personally I ignore them.
"""And please take some tips from dr judy mikovits on youtube""That might be hard since YouTube removed her Covid video."
"The video is off but you can still find other info about this lady, enough for each to make its own opinion. I have watched both the video and have read plenty of available info found on the net, and for me, she is not a reliable or unbiased source of informations related to COVID-19. YMMV."

We were to fly in to Zanzibar arriving 7th July. Today we have had our flights with Qatar airlines cancelled. Hopefully get to see Zanzibar next year.
"Our holiday to Zanzibar at the end of this month has been cancelled, but we're planning to re-book for next year as we are determined to return after enjoying our first holiday to the island in 2017."
@14 I'm trying to book for July 2021 but Tui only have availability up to end of Apr 2021 at the moment. Other destinations are showing for up to end of October 2021. Want to get booked as soon as possible.
There are some cases here but every thing is good people are heathyZanzibar does not affected much with covid 19I hope everything will be better soon
@17We were booked Manchester -Doha- Zanzibar. Qatar airways have resumed some flights.....we could get to Doha but the Doha to Zanzibar leg has not resumed. Hopefully soon get booked for July 2021.
"Mainland Tanzania (Tanzaniqua) will allow passenger flights as from June. Zanzibar hasn't decided yet. Zanzibar is in a union with Tanzaniqua but in many aspects has her own rules and regulations. As from June, you can get to Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam, from there you can take the ferry. Domestic flights between Dar and Zanzibar apparently resume in July. However, by what I hear some hotels here plan to re-open in July, provided passenger flights are allowed to land here.I will post any news I hear about flights and hotels re-opening on my Facebook page Zanzibar Insider Buzz.www.zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.com"
"#19 Interesting.I was eyeing some Turkish Airlines flights form Paris (for me) and Moscow (for my girlfriend) direct to ZNZ, or possibly Flydubaï from Moscow, but it looks like they might not start before other flights to Dar.Too bad, because we wanted to start in Zanzibar, that would have been much more practical.Mind you, at this point I don't even know if flights from Moscow are going to resume before those to ZNZ do...As of this moment, are ferries running between Dar and Zanzibar, and are there any travel restrictions ?"
"#20 I believe at present only freight is carried on the ferries, no passengers. Please check with www.azammarine.com as to when this will change as well as any travel restrictions applicable."
Thanks for the link
