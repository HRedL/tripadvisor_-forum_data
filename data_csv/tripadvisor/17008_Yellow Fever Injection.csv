"I am visiting Iguazu Falls in January, but will only be visiting the Argentinian side as I don't have a visa for Brazil. I will fly into IGR and stay at the Sheraton Iguazu Resort and Spa for two nights. I know you need a yellow fever injection for the Brazil side, but do you need one if you are staying on the Argentinian side only? I will try to do all the walks, tours etc that are available in the National Park."
I think you have answered your own question. Do you need YF for Argentina?
Sorry - what's the answer. Yes or no!
no
Yellow fever? Let me think a bit... the last epidemic was in 1870 if I recall correctly
"No, neither for Argentina nor for Brazil."
Our health clinic in Canada recommend a YF immunization for South America. I guess it's the better be safe than sorry plan.
"South America is a big place. Yellow Fever occurs only in a few places. Most people would think twice about injecting diseases, without good cause."
"There have been very few cases of YF in the Falls region over a 4 year time. I have never been asked for my YF documents in Foz or Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru. In the Amazonian region it is better to have such. If arriving in this region you may way the pros and cons with your doctor. The doctor can advise you better due to your medical history and age.The vaccine cost was pricy also. Have some good repellant and use it. These little ""skitters"" pack a punch. Use some ice and an anti-itch cream. If no allergy take and aspirin and it help a lot."
"Indeed. South America is a big place so suggesting YF shot just for the sake of going is a bit overcautious , at the least.I have been twice at the falls and did not have the vaccine first.True that there are mosquitoes, but you do not read on the media about YF epidemic"
