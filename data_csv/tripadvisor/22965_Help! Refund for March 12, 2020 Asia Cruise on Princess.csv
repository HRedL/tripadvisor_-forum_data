"Princess will not refund our money and the flights have been canceled for this cruise based on the info below. On Friday, Delta announced it would temporarily suspend all flights from the U.S. to China starting Feb. 6 and running through April 30.American Airlines also announced on Friday that it would suspend all flights to and from the Chinese mainland beginning Friday and running through March 27.Travel.State.Gov. - Travel Advisory February 2, 2020 China - Level 4: Do Not TravelAny assistance you can provide is appreciated. Thanks!"
The only thing you can do is to negotiate with Princess or the travel agent whom you booked the cruise with. Posting here does not help as we are just single internet users with no connection with Princess.
Understand however I was wondering if someone had experience this before. Thank you!
Did you take travel insurance? In the UK travel insurance normally covers you if the company won't refund and government advice is not to travel. Also here if you pay by credit card you can try credit card company. Nothing here to force companies to refund AFAIK. Not sure what situation is in your country.
"You may have more leverage than you think, but you didn't give much information. 1) What is the cruise and start point? Is the start point and any of the itinerary involving mainland Chinese ports or Hong Kong?2) Did you book flights separately for yourself or as inclusions/adds to the cruise part? 3) Did you use a credit card to pay? Since you are quoting US sources, can we assume you and your bank are US-based?4) Did you take out travel insurance for the cruise part and if so, have you read the fine print and seen any exclusion for epidemics?Answers to these will determine your next best steps.Edited: 10:31 am, February 04, 2020 "
"A look at the Princess Cruise schedule for Asia shows that March 12 departures, one of which you are apparently taking, are only : 1) Majestic Princess, dep Singapore end Hong Kong (ports of call in Thailand and Vietnam)2) Sapphire Princess, dep and end Singapore (ports of call Malaysia, Indonesia).Right now, Princess may be refusing to refund on these because there are no mainland China ports on these itineraries. And with access to Singapore still open to foreign nationals who have NOT traversed through China in the past 14 days (I think they have not shut to Hong Kong arrivals so far), their position may be that you can get yourself to the Singapore cruise port and that doing an acceptable booking/routing is your problem. Therefore, any cancellation is on you.However, I think that this position by the cruise line could change in the near future, as most SE Asian countries have put up some sort of restrictions to new arrivals, and this may get increasingly restrictive. Plus, Princess has had an issue with a Diamond Princess passenger traveling Yokohama to HK then coming down sick with coronavirus. Cruise ship arrivals into SE Asian ports may become problematic and if that happens, it will likely affect March cruises as well as February ones. Summary: perhaps you should not jump the gun just yet, and wait 2-3 weeks to see if Princess proactively cancels the March 12 Asia cruises (IMO, better than 75% chance that they will). Then you may not have to do too much chasing to get your refund. As of now, using the excuse to Princess that Delta cancelled your flights so you have to cancel their cruise, is probably not the strongest argument in your favor unless Princess also included the Delta flights in the cruise package.Edited: 12:40 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said a recent passenger in Asia tested positive for coronavirus, prompting Japanese health officials to delay the ship he’d been on while they conduct a review of all guests and crew.Princess said in an emailed statement Monday that the passenger embarked in Yokohama, Japan, on Jan. 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The ship, Diamond Princess, then continued its round-trip journey to ultimately take other passengers back to Yokohama, which is near Tokyo."
"I realize that your goal is a refund for services, but the travel industry is also suffering tremendously from this virus situation, and is having to make many last-minute decisions.It is unlikely that Princess would want to cancel an entire cruise, but they may reposition and make it easier for travelers to access the ship.Do you have travel insurance? If you cannot locate a flight to the cruise, perhaps the travel insurance would cover the cruise cost. Did the cruise line book your air or did you do it on your own? Ask the cruise line to find air for you if you do not have it yet.Ask if the cruise line will allow you to transfer your payment to another cruise experience if this itinerary is not possible.The fact that one of their ships is sitting in quarantine right now will make the cruise lines much more cautious in allowing certain passengers on board or in calling upon certain destinations. Perhaps they will be more lenient in making a decision as we move further through this month."
"CNBC Princess Cruises said it has placed 3,700 passengers and crew under mandatory quarantine after ten passengers aboard a cruise ship in Yokohama tested positive for the new coronavirus.The company said Monday that a previous guest, who didn’t have any symptoms while aboard the ship, tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday.The ship was being held in Japan for 24 hours while Japanese health authorities assessed the 3,700 passengers and crew on board."
"2 weeks! Extra 2 weeks of free food and room on cruise ship. Princess Cruises said it has placed 3,700 passengers and crew under mandatory quarantine for two weeks after ten passengers aboard a cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan tested positive for the new coronavirus."
"This is puzzling, the 10 confirmed cases on this cruise;2 Australians, 3 Japanese, 3 HKers, 1 American, 1 Filipino crew. That mean they were infected on the cruise ship?"
">> That mean they were infected on the cruise ship?Lots of cases show that the new conoravirus can be spreaded among people...so no surprise.Edited: 10:51 pm, February 04, 2020 "
Thank you so much!
I agree - we only get the story they want us to hear!
"Princess cruise is the cheapest cruise with double passengers, but still there is lots of space on ship, you don’t get that close physically to strangers. In this case, 10 people from different nations which traditionally don’t mix or sit together for meal. So how does one HK passengers contaminated 10 diverse passengers? Obviously sharing same space breathing same air, but they shouldn’t be that close physically. Japanese and HK folks or Filipino crew are not the hug and kiss or hand shaking types. Guess it was in the air?"
"https://m.facebook.com/david.abel.75This guy is on the ship and giving a play by play and very interesting. I could not think of a worse fate than being sitting in a little statement (at least he has a balcony) and not be able to move out of there for 14 days? And they are not getting gourmet meals at all. The stress will no doubt make more people sick. I guess we can just think that the passenger that got off had some contact with one or more of the now infected people and they are spreading it. Might be more with the long incubation period. And we know nothing about the passenger that got off at HK and sure he could have been in close proximity to these new cases.Edited: 12:18 pm, February 05, 2020 "
We know way to little to assess how it spread. There are a couple of cases in the crew - image someone working in the kitchen crew being infected...It's definitely not a pleasant experience to be on one of the 2 quarantined cruises now. Very strange is - they first announced that they only tested 276 people - and had 10 infections out of the first 36 lab tests. Why did we hear nothing back about the other tests today. Have they all been negative or are they simply not sure. The information seems to be no less filtered than the information coming out of China.
"""Have they all been negative or are they simply not sure."" - They removed the people who are infected from the ship, so I think at this point nobody else has tested positive yet otherwise those people would also have been removed. The 276 people they tested are the people who had close contact with the person that initially tested positive. I would assume they will do additional tests on people who have had close contact with some of the additional positive cases."
"Royal Caribbean Cruises warned of more canceled cruises in its fourth-quarter earnings call Tuesday and said it expects to take an earnings hit of 25 cents per share after canceling eight cruises out of China because of the coronavirus outbreak.“It seems likely that we will have to cancel more, but we don’t know how many,” Royal Caribbean Chairman and CEO Richard Fain said during the call. “This is all very disappointing to us.”The cruise line has also implemented multiple measures to protect passengers against the illness. Boarding will be denied to anyone who has traveled through mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days. Mandatory health screenings will also be performed on guests who have a China or Hong Kong passport and passengers who report feeling unwell or flu-like symptoms.The company has already canceled eight cruises out of China and modified itineraries for other trips, including the complete removal of its Spectrum of the Seas ship from service in China. It has contingency plans in place in case the outbreak spreads further, according to Executive Vice President and CFO Jason Liberty.In an interview with CNBC, Fain said he does not think the restrictions will impact Royal Caribbean negatively.“I think that everyone understands that the best way to deal with an outbreak is to contain it,” he said."
"As it turns out, another 10 cases. Likely still from the first 276 sample. Because the rest of the people were supposed to get tested yesterday (if they managed)"
"I recalled seeing most passengers, over 1000 are Japanese, 400 Americans, very few Chinese passengers, the source was actually a HKer. That was unexpected."
for the OP...I am sure all of your payments have been made . For now they have cancelled this cruise up to Feb. 20th...they will go week by week. I think the chance of yours being cancelled is good and I think your best bet is to let it play out. I think many are feeling that they don't want to cruise in this area at least for many many months and of course any new bookings for spring will not be happening...they may make a business decision to offer at least change of ship etc. If you have insurance that provides cancel for any reason then the decision is yours otherwise I would wait. Right now Princess does not even know how long they will tread water on this current sailing.
I don't want to do any research now - but I would be worried about them going bankrupt if they mainly operate in that area. But then likely there is an insurance? I also think right now for any kind of trip bookings (except hotels) around China - you can only sit back and wait for the operator to cancel (except if you can cancel and get back more than 70-80% - then cancel now).And a normal travel insurance will not pay for pandemics/fear. They usually will have to pay if your operator goes bankrupt (no matter what reason).
Princess is not going bankrupt...they will just scale way back for the next year or two on cruises in Asia...they cruise the world. No worries there.
"I am also reiterating that the Princess cruise line will NOT go bankrupt. Princess is aligned with Carnival, Holland America, Costa and Cunard cruise lines.Asia was a growing market but they cruise all over the world.There is a long history of cruise lines rerouting and avoiding areas after serious incidents. For example, Istanbul was recently off the cruise circuit for multiple years... (and it was a VERY popular stop).I am sure they would rather reroute than cancel, but they have a lot to rearrange on a short notice.Hopefully you will hear something soon."
"There are actually 2 cruise ships being quarantined.David Abel’s 50th wedding anniversary luxury cruise began with him eating his fill and enjoying the sights of East Asia.It’s ending with him quarantined in his cabin aboard the Diamond Princess for two extra weeks, eating a “lettuce sandwich with some chicken inside” and watching 20 infected people escorted off the ship, heading for hospitals for treatment of a new virus.Abel is among hundreds of passengers on two cruise ships in Japan and Hong Kong who are caught in the drama and fear about the little-understood, but fast-spreading new type of coronavirus.Tests are still pending on some passengers and crew who have symptoms or had contact with infected people.“It’s not going to be a luxury cruise; it’s going to be like a floating prison,” Abel said on Facebook from the ship in the port of Yokohama, outside Tokyo.As Japanese officials loaded the ship with supplies on Thursday to make the quarantine as bearable as possible, passengers took to social media to highlight kindnesses by the crew and to complain about dwindling medicine, the quality of the food and the inability to exercise or even leave their cabins.On the World Dream ship quarantined in Hong Kong, its more than 3,600 passengers and crew were being screened because eight passengers on an earlier voyage had the virus. Hong Kong officials said more than 5,000 passengers on three voyages beginning January 19 may have been exposed."
"Almost 2,000 tourists are being held on a cruise ship in Hong Kong and being tested for the new coronavirus after several crew members reported symptoms associated with the illness.Passengers aboard the World Dream ship, operated by Genting’s Dream Cruises, are being barred from disembarking at Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Cruise Terminal until test results from three suspected cases are returned.The ship arrived in Hong Kong from Taiwan on Wednesday with 1,871 passengers aboard. The vast majority were from Hong Kong, but several passengers traveled to join the cruise from other countries, including Australia, the U.K. and Canada.Three people from mainland China who had previously been on the World Dream between Jan. 19 and 24 had been diagnosed with the virus, according to Reuters. However, Dream Cruises confirmed on Wednesday that no one currently on the ship was from mainland China.Around 30 crew members reported “various minor symptoms” such as coughs and sore throats during health screenings upon arrival in Hong Kong, according to Dream Cruises. While one crew member was diagnosed with flu, temperature screenings did not confirm fever in the remaining 29 crew members.However, three crew members who said they had felt feverish have been sent to public hospitals for further testing for the coronavirus.Samples from crew members who reported other symptoms have also been taken to medical facilities for precautionary testing."
"Diamond Princess, 41 new confirmed cases, total now 61 confirmed cases. 21 Japanese, 8 Americans, 5 Australians, 5 Canadians, 1 UK, 1 Argentine. Ship passengers, 1285 Japan, 470 HK, 425 USA, 215 Canada, 40 UK, 25 Russia, 20 Taiwan. 15 Israel, 13 NZ. A Taiwan based cruise ship now at sea is not allowed to return to Taiwan, not sure where the passengers can go."
"A Royal Caribbean cruise ship scheduled to dock in Bayonne, New Jersey, early Friday has at least a dozen Chinese nationals on board in isolation who will be tested for coronavirus, a source familiar with the ship said.Some of the passengers, who are returning from the Bahamas, have pulmonary issues, according to the source."
I still haven't found any source saying that they checked all the passengers of Diamond Princess. To me it seems so far only the 276 danger cases got checked. I may be wrong - but to me it looks like Japan so far is not up to testing many cases.If it's 61 out of 276 - we can only wait for another round of cases from that ship. On the world dream however - they seam to have trapped something different. All people which showed symptoms tested negative so far. Maybe some food poisoning or normal flu. Then there are people on board who lived in the same cabin as people infected - but they were kept on the vessel - it's only a waiting game till they get taken out into hospital too.I for sure would not board any cruise ship in the next few months...
"Royal Caribbean has decided to prohibit any guest holding a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport from boarding any of its ships, regardless of residency throughout the month of February.The cruise line announced the stricter rule, in addition to tighter screening policies that were revealed this week.Additionally, Royal Caribbean has tightened the health screening requirements and the following guests will need to undergo extra screenings to ensure safety at the cruise terminal:Anyone that has been in contact with individuals that have traveled from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau in the last 15 days.Anyone that feels unwell or demonstrates flu-like symptoms.Any guest presenting with fever or low blood oximetry in the specialized health screening will be denied boarding.Royal Caribbean feels obligated to institute such stringent rules in order to, ""maintain a safe and healthy environment onboard our ships, as well as in the ports we visit."""
Latest confirmed cases total count on Diamond Princess is 130 cases.
"""Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato previously said the Government was considering testing everyone on board before allowing them to disembark.""And so far they only tested people showing symptoms or being very close to announced cases! They should better as quickly as possible evacuate everyone from the cruise and quarantine them in smaller groups."
just overnight another 60 confirmed...this is so alarming...even worse 5 are crew and just now passengers have received decent masks.Unclear if passengers are taking food trays from crew without masks on?With a spread this fast one has to look at the food source...also they are allowing walking on deck under controlled conditions...however with this rate of spread they need to revisit everything.
"They have considered the virus was transmitted through food, by workers. Seen no update on that. Seems more logical than transmission from one 80 years old HK super spreader to 130 unrelated people."
Mac lots of talk now about the meal prep which is being done onboard..after last night and I should now update the total to 66 new cases with 5 being crew that is what I would be looking at. Probably should be prep by outside catering and sealed up and brought in. Also when passengers answer the door to get meals they don't seem to be wearing masks...they could have it and give it to crew.
"Royal Caribbean has decided to prohibit any guest holding a Chinese, Hong Kong, or Macau passport from boarding any of its ships, regardless of residency throughout the month of February.The cruise line announced the stricter rule, in addition to tighter screening policies that were revealed this week.Now this is stupid. So foreigners who live in China can join the cruise, whereas Chinese citizens who live outside of China cannot?During the SARS crisis, we went on a cruise with friends. Those with residence at HK and Toronto were not allowed to join, regardless of their citizenship."
Total 135 cases on Diamond Princess.
"Cruise Ship Rejected by Four Nations Runs Out of Options.Thailand became the latest country to turn a Holland America Line cruise ship away from one of its ports, prompting pleas for help from some of the 2,257 passengers and crew desperate to disembark after almost two weeks at sea.Fearing some guests aboard the Westerdam may be infected with the deadly new coronavirus, Thailand’s Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announced in a short Facebook post Tuesday that he’s directed authorities to refuse entry into a port near Bangkok."
"If you look at the dates these cruise ships boarding and sailing dates, Wuhan already in quarantine, news all over the world. These passengers still went on the cruise ships. Not only caused themselves the agony but also wasting tremendous precious medical resources of many governments. Good examples of selfishness. Not sure if they deserve any sympathy."

"Hi,Has this issue been resolved by Princess for you? We are booked on this cruise as well and Princess state that they are not allowing any passengers or crew that have been in mainland China or Hong Kong to board Princess ships, but they refuse to provide an update on if/when/where this ship will be rerouted to. Princess have changed Sapphire Princess and Sun Princess itineraries for after this cruise but seem to be ignoring Majestic Princess.Please let me know if you managed to get a refund.Thanks Lisa."
"#45 by now Princess should know what they are going to do with the March 12 Majestic Princess departure. As of now, if they don't cancel entirely, the only thing they are likely to change is the final destination port of Hong Kong. Likely they will go to Taiwan or Manila to end up, or return to Singapore. That's if current conditions in those countries don't worsen appreciably. You should be able to contact Princess and get the scoop on what's going on and what your options are. Try using the phone if you can't get any satisfaction by email."
"I've tried phone, email and social media. They keep saying be patient. They have not changed it as yet."
"Well, be patient then."
"As of now, Taiwan, the Philippines don’t want any cruise ships, same with all other countries. They can start from Cambodia and end in Cambodia."
