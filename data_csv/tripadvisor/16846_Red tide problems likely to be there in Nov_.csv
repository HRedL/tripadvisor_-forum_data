I am planning a family Thanksgiving trip to Marco Island but if this red tide problem is a lasting issue we might reconsider. Does anyone know if it’s usually clear waters in November?Thanks Kvmac
"Like any epidemic, there's simply no way to know."
"I've been on Marco for several weeks in November every year for the last 4 years - Red Tide was not an issue. It's a delightful time of the year to be on the island. Warm, dry weather and not crowded."
My favorite month is November on Marco. I have never seen red tide in November. I have never seen brown water on Marco Island in 40 years of visiting.
"I certainly hope it’s gone by November. But, I’m not sure the fact that people haven’t seen it in November means much. I’m fairly new to SW Florida, but, I keep hearing that it’s VERY unusual for it to be around for months, and, it has been."
Thanks
Hopefully it will be just like that - thanks!
Thanks - I hope you are right
Good to know - thanks
Yep! I will keep up with the newsThankd
just wondering is there red tide now- going to marco island in lees than 2 weeks
I spend 2 mos there in feb -apr the red tide happens at random. So day on day off depending on currents and winds maybe you can overthink this.So you may avoid it or not just a thing on the gulf side at times. Not very predictable.
We have a home on the west coast. There are a bunch of people commenting that they go to Florida in November and have not had a problem. I don't think people understand that the Red Tide this year is different. The problem has been going on over 8-9 months almost continuous which is unprecedented. Normal red tide lasts a few days to a week and is a mild inconvenience - This is Pollution fueled Red Tide to the extreme. Florida is currently an ecological disaster. I actually think it may be good if it goes into the winter so the snow birds understand what is going on. With that said they usually slow/stop releases from Lake O in the winter which would stop the red tide.
I have a home on the gulf coast too- and for us the red tide started last October. So more like 12 months for us.
The brown water releases from Lake O to Ft Myers start to decline the first of October ... per US Army Engineers.
