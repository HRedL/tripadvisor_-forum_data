"My Extensive requests to the major Insurance Providers has resulted in a resounding ""No Way""Perhaps someone has found a provider? Even at an exorbitant cost."
Seven Corners looks promising.
I’ve seen several policies that cover covid travel guard has them world nomads has them etc. I’m not sure why people keep saying it’s not covered. Now if you are looking for a policy that’s going to cover you in the event of a quarantine you’re probably going to need to buy cancel for any reason insurance. But if you’re looking for one that’s going to cover if you get sick before you go or while you’re there you’re probably fine
"Posted this in another thread on this yesterday#24 of 27 ·From Travel Guard's insurance informationFOR POLICIES PURCHASED ON OR AFTER MARCH 11On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. Therefore, any losses for trip cancellation, trip interruption and/or trip delay caused by or resulting from quarantine due to COVID-19 is not considered “Unforeseen” and will not be covered under the terms and conditions of this insurance policy.However, this does not affect any Medical Benefits available under the insurance policy. If you contract COVID-19 prior to departure, you would be covered for Trip Cancellation, if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis and/or you are medically unable to travel at the time of departure due to COVID-19. If you contract COVID-19 while on a covered trip, you would be covered for Medical Expense and Trip Interruption/Curtailment benefits if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis.Hmmm... looks to me like Covid is covered if I get it at home or away...."
Manulife in Canada will cover covid as long as the non essential travel advisory is lifted.
