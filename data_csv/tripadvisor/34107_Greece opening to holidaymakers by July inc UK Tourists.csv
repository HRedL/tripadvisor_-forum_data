Personally I'll believe it when I see it. Hopefully it happens as we're meant to be travelling to Chania on 24th July https:/…

"The pre-flight tests could be a major issue. After making bookings and paying for your flight, accommodations and car rental you are about to board the plane, take a test and FAIL!You lose big time.The US is at risk . . . not only with the virus but that ""person"" running the country!"
"#4 I'd expect that if tourists are going to fly, there will need to be tests done in the airport before departure. 2 or 3 days before isn't any use. It's an incentive for the tour operators though."
"There is no test that can be done in a few minutes to prove you are free of this virus. Samples are sent to a lab. Checking someone's temperature is not a valid alternative - especially as you could cheat even if you had a fever.If the test is to prove you have had it and the assumption is you are then immune - what if you've never had it? You can't go anywhere? And there is so far no reliable antigen test for the antibodies you would have after having the virus and recovering.Let's see what the announcement is when it happens.Edited: 5:16 pm, April 27, 2020 "
Exactly rtj70. No amount of speculation on our part will influence Greece’s approach. We all know the limitations of testing as it stands at present. Definitely a wait and see situation.
"If Greece's plan is to have a health passport that relies on an antigen test for the antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 then the irony is because their own interventions stopped the spread of the virus, few Greeks should test positive for the antibodies."
"From the WHO website:https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/d…One important sentence is: ""As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans."""
"They’ve also stated, I believe, that even if you have had C-19 and therefore created anti-bodies, these may not necessarily prevent you from getting the virus again."
"Without intending to burst your bubbles, I have to tell you that this kind of thing just - won't happen. This summer will be no holidays, no cheap flights, there will be no mass cheap tourism, especially not - the packages. I hope all this slowly becoming - plus quam perfectum and thank God for that. It’s better to say it than to nurture one's empty illusions. Who can get here by car, with the necessary medical certificates - ok. Those, to whom it’s impossible - they will stay at home."
"Ntragkon and 123twinkletoes have to agree with you both . We got 84 deaths in a population of 25 million and our government wont even let us go to different states let alone over seas or even sit in a coffee shop . We have been advised that the earliest any one will be let go over seas is some time in 2021.Greece has a 5% mortality rate we have 1% so why any one would make statements that Greece will allow tourists in July is beyond me.The Greek government and people have achieved great things and I cant see them destroying all their hard work so some one can drink ouzo on the beach.Edited: 11:39 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Hi comet. I don’t know if you are aware of it but a programme airs on TV in the UK called ‘Nothing to Declare’ which is about Australia’s unbelievably strict immigration and customs policies. If your government’s depth of resolve and control has been replicated in its handling of the C-19 outbreak (except for the cruise ships fiasco!), I can understand why your numbers of deaths are so low, taken together with other geographical factors of course.I personally think this outbreak will change the face of air travel for many until such time as a vaccine is developed. Sitting on a plane before then is not an enticing prospect and I think social distancing will stick in the minds of some people long after this current situation is brought under control. It’ll be interesting to hear what the Greek government proposes and how any measures would work in reality. More information in due course no doubt."
"Well, if the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 does not confer at least some immunity to subsequent infection then there will be no vaccine. Vaccines work on the same principle of antibodies and elicit weaker and shorter response compared with having the disease.Edited: 3:06 am, April 28, 2020 "
a certificate showing clear a week before a holiday does not stop the same person getting it in the same week. It takes 4-14 days for this virus to incubate inside the body. So by that time you could be on a plane or on holiday. So not sure how it will work as of yet
"Agree wholeheartedly Delboy. This has been discussed in depth elsewhere.....we have so many active threads on this subject now its tough keeping abreast of what everyone’s thinking!However, it’s good to deal in hard facts, so the ‘sticky’ at the head of the Greece forum is the one to follow.for the very latest announcements by the Greek government. Nicksy and others are doing a great job of rapidly posting any official updates."
"Australia’s unbelievably strict immigration and customs policies. Thanks 123twinkletoes but believe it or not you actually get in here quite easy. Not now of course but there are so many visas like work visa ,student visa ,family visa ,Thats just to name a few . Then there are the asylum seekers most come by plane now as we have stopped the boats . Then there is skilled migration,business migration,then if you marry a Australian citizen even if you get divorced in 3 months you can stay. If you are an asylum seeker and you have a baby in Australia then that baby is an Australian citizen so you cant really kick the people out (there is a case thats gone all the way to the high court this week on this issue.)But having said all that having been in Europe and in London and Greece and Germany in the last few years your problems far far far out weigh ours .Your point is very valid. Mrs Merkel has got a lot to answer for in may opinion.. I was stunned at what I saw in Trafalgar Square 2 years ago. Having been an emigrant my self came here when I was 6 from Chania I cant really get on a high horse and say no no more. Come for a Visit when this is all over lolEdited: 4:18 am, April 28, 2020 "
Watching that programme you mentioned Twinkletoes I think half of them want to bring in the ingredients that could make the next strain
"Hi don’t know what the program showed but under a certain Prime minister that government let 50,000 boat people into the country:Most were economic refugees and the people smugglers made a fortune:Many of the smugglers had connections in the Indonesia government and had people in Australia coordinate the movement:It came to a head when 300 drowned in reach of shore :lt was disgusting the news were all over it and You could see the people drown in front of your eyes ;The Rudd government got thrown out and 10 years later they are still out :thank goodness .It was a mess .The only ones that made a killing were the immigration lawyers and the people smugglers . I am glad those days are overEdited: 5:14 am, April 28, 2020 "
#21. You are so right Delboy. Glad you watch the programme too. Can’t believe the pretence of innocence either.....some of them deserve Oscars!!
"@cometOh you might get a couple trying to bring in bird spit nests, large beetles, snake guts etc and they get confiscated. And others are given an apple by Qantas and fined 120 dollars for not declaring itEdited: 5:25 am, April 28, 2020 "
"These are some things that are EXPECTED to be announced today:On Monday, May 4, the opening of small shops and hairdressers most likely will take place, with a limit of two customers within the space.If no set backs, cafes, bars and restaurants are expected to open again towards the end of May. According to media, customers will be allowed only in the outdoor areas and with a safety distance among them.Tourist businesses are expected to open again in June (but only for domestic tourism!!!) as so will shopping malls.A common European framework for flights is required before foreign tourists can start coming to Greece, most possible under certain conditions and specific measures.The presentation of ""the roadmap of the lockdown lifting"" by the Prime Minister is apparently set at 5pm CET."
"Hi guys just to stick my nose in again as there aint much else to do.Here in the land of OZ we are patting each other on the back because not only have we flattened the curve apparently we have just about won. Thats what we are getting told but I am a bit sceptical. Now if what we are being told by the chief medical officer is correct and I hope it is we are winning.Now remember we have flattened the curve as of  of the the last few days. Now we have been informed that we will not able to travel overseas until October . Thats six months away and remember we have flattened the curve.If we are lucky enough that it will in fact be October it will be very difficult to travel any way due to the price or the airfares.This is because the middle seats of the aircraft will be removed and there will be added cost with each aircraft for cleaning and other costs due to the virus.The airlines also want to recoup their losses. So six months away . We have flattened the curve and you got to be a multi millionaire just to get a economy seat. We have a major airline gone broke here. They were a basket case before the virus owned by you know who,which owes 7 billion yes 7 billion to creditors . You are bound to have that sort of thing happen there and as a matter of fact Virgin Atlantic is one.So if the world is looking at us as an example then six months is six months and airfares will be very very costly.. In this post I have stated facts and opinions . I certainly hope that my opinions are totally wrong."
"Have just seen on the news the beautiful beaches in Australia ‘open for business’ again......as I’m watching torrential drain drizzle down the windows here ☹️.But, agreed, the impact on future air travel, world-wide, will be colossal. All will unfold in the fullness of time......"
"In all honesty folks who would want to spend hours inside of a plane in the near future,it was the norm to pick up all sorts of bugs before this current situation.The mind boggles,at least it's nearly time for the Border controls programmes,yes i'm a huge fan too,and had to laugh about Delboy's comment on that poor British family who were fined for the couple of pieces of fruit,totally unfair especially considering the amount of food products some tourists bring in.If you enjoyed seeing the Aussie beaches twinkletoes have a watch of Bondi Rescue if you can get the channel that shows it most days."
/123twinkletoes don’t fret about the beaches It’s going to be the wettest and coldest April day here in 20 years from tomorrow:l don’t think we will be rushing to the beach any time soon LOL
"Hi guys that’s how it used to be .Our government in its wisdom has slashed the budgets of Border Force,Customs and Quarantine Last time into the country declared chocolates girl says what you got .l say chocolates from Germany she says what ever and let’s me through .Its almost like On the Buses with Reg Varney :They wear the uniforms but their hearts not in it"
I think the programme starts by saying these staff have dedicated their lives to ensure Australia keeps their environment free lol

">>In all honesty folks who would want to spend hours inside of a plane in the near future,it was the norm to pick up all sorts of bugs before this current situation.<<I learned this from a pilot: In modern planes the filters used are of hospital quality. Between 94 and 99.9 percent of airborne microbes are captured, and there’s a total changeover of air every two or three minutes — far more frequently than occurs in offices, movie theaters, or classrooms.Edited: 10:41 am, April 28, 2020 "
/DelboyAylesbury what you see in that pro mo is now automated as l think it is in the UK for EU citizens Get to departure international is show passport and facial recognition and exit is the same .Scan passport get slip insert slip look into camera gate opens and that’s it .A High percentage of the work is also done by private contractors as well
Nicksy @38 - brilliant info - thanks.
"Hi Nicksy,A lot of the tour company planes used on routes can be old planes eg TUI fleet average age is 10 years old so some even older. Will all the planes have the new system on board"
That sounds fairly reassuring Nicksy. I was just talking to hubby and saying that the people who were repatriated from some countries on planes recently haven’t all gone on to get Covid-19 from those flights.Think it is all a game of chance - the more it can be reduced the better!
"Delboy, instead of 'new' planes I should have written 'modern' planes. So, yes most planes have that. Unless they shoud be over 30 years old and without an overhaul in that period."
Thanks Nicksy.sometime ago I sat in the opposite aisle to a lady wearing a mask. Not normally seen on a plane and wondered why she needed it. Four days later I came down with a flu type bug and knew why lol.
