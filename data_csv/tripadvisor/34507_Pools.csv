"Hi,could anyone confirm what restrictions, if any other than the obvious social distancing ,are/will be in place around hotel swimming pools or will they be closed.Thanks."
I hope most if not all pools will be closed! They are Infection generating centers! Walk to the beach folks nd the Algarve has the most wonderful beaches! I value my health! Nd don’t want someone else’s Covid germs!
I'm not sure about hotels. But I live on a condimium with a communal pool. Management company took the pool closed signs and do not cross tape away today. No sunbeds appeared though. As many pools were unattended for months the seagulls moved in. Use with caution.
Pools reopened as part of the phase 3 easing.Rules on social distancing remain in place.
"pools will be in use, safe and measures to stop crowding in and around the pool"
"In the Polio outbreak in the '50s pools were one of the places where transmission was thought to have occurred. Avoid like the ""plague""."
How is 'social distancing' to be enforced for anyone daring to go into the pool itself? Would it matter anyway if viruses are floating around in it?
"Jock apparently the new saying is or will be in future ""avoid like coronavirus"""
"""There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus."" https:/…COVID-19-and-WaterThen in what it concerns the other equipment is up to the management to follow the hygiene rules..."
Best to rent a villa with private pool.
