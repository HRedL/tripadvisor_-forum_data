Has anyone any reservations about travel with the recent outbreak of the corona virus? I have to travel out of JFK beginning of Feb for vacation in Aruba and was wondering if anyone has seen anything different in the airports etc.
"Not saying this to be snarky, but as long as you’re not connecting through China I wouldn’t worry about it.Seriously."
It appears that all 5 cases in America are from people who returned from China. I would not worry and I would go and enjoy Aruba.
No but we will be traveling through JFK which is apparently of serious concern by NYC where many of the countries identified with confirmed cases have come through
"Could someone coming through JFK at the Jet Blue terminal have just arrived from China, sure. Is it likely they are connecting to Aruba, unlikely.If you are that concerned you can wear a mask while at the airport."
<< “ If you are that concerned you can wear a mask while at the airport.” >>If that makes you feel better... but won’t do anything. This virus is spread by touching something with virus on it... not airborne.
You live in NJ. I’m sure people from China go to NJ too. There’s always a risk.
Actually it appears to be able to be spread 3 feet away from what I have read. Not sure its something that lingers in the air for weeks at a time but not really sure.
Adding a lime to your Corona will protect you from any virus. Kinda like scurvy.
"then why is JFK one of the airports checking Chinese flights,,coming in, and I will also be traveling the beginning of Feb, through JFK international to Aruba and I will be wearing a mask, you dont have to go to china, they are coming here"
And the World Health Organization just declared a global emergency. I also watched an interview of a female college student who is desperately trying to get out and finally found a flight to Africa. However she mentioned two of her college friends managed to get flights out one going to the UK and the other to Hawaii!! I hope our government is paying attention to where and how these US citizens are coming back into america. I mean they made a big to do with our diplomats and their families came back into the US. They are quarantined what precautions are they taking when these people get on an airplane to prevent the spread to those people.
"As long as there are no reported cases in N.y.c. by then or in northern n.j., I would go. Aruba is safe. No virus and not a big vacation destination by Chinese."
"just as an fyi there is a decent size group of Chinese people in Aruba....they own many of the small little supermarkets that are in almost every neighborhood. That said I would still go. Sounds like almost all flights in or out of China are grounded at this point.Edited: 1:32 pm, January 31, 2020 "
It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and droplets are inhaled through nostrils or mouth so a mask would help
"<< “ It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and droplets are inhaled through nostrils or mouth” >>While true that it CAN be contracted that way, viruses such as this are easily — and much more commonly — contracted by touching something an infected person has sneezed/coughed on and then touching your face, eyes, etc.Aerosolized droplets from sneezes/coughs only stay in the air for a few second. To catch it that way you’d really need an infected person to sneeze/cough right in your face.Edited: 11:21 am, February 01, 2020 "

I just came back from Aruba and their were very few wearing masks tho I did come home with a terrible cold I swear everyone on my plane was coughing.
"Curly ... good post but more info is needed. Mortality RatesSARS 9.5% as you postCorona Virus 2+% ... early to know for sureFLU 0.1%. True, more people die from flu ... But if Corona Virus gets out it will be a pandemic far worse than the flu. Caution is the important behavior right now. I will visit Aruba in March... I hope travel is back to normal."

"Good info from Curlyontario and Profguy. We are still intending to go next month. All said and done, at this time, it is more likely to get the flu."
I am leaving for Curacao tomorrow. I am cheating on Aruba but my friend found it too expensive. I look forward to my next Aruba trip when my husband can go too.
"Curly - Have a great trip to Curaçao. Think you will find it to be significantly different than Aruba in a positive fashion. Be sure to spend some time in Willemstad. Hope you do a comparative report. Despite differences of opinions on some things, always find you reports or responses interesting.Edited: 11:58 am, February 02, 2020 "
Thanks! I will definitely post a comparative.
In answer to your question I teach emergency responders about weapons of mass destruction and hazardous materials response. When a person sneezes into the air without covering up those droplets don't stay in the air for a few seconds they can actually stay airborne for an hour. That means they can travel with the air currents in a closed room or airplane etc you get the drift and land on objects when they do finally settle out of the air. If you touch those objects and then rub your eyes or put your fingers to your mouth say to eat a snack etc you could possibly transmit it in that fashion. Frankly I am surprised the airlines and government are making everyone on a plane wear a face mask to prevent just such occurences.
"Actually the death rate is likely similar to SARSyes it might be 2% deaths with a denominator of current casesbut there is at least 10-14 day lag if not longer between number of cases and deaths... so if you back up and compare current deaths to number of cases 2 weeks ago you get a far higher death rate. Also it is definitely airborne and maybe surface borne. Coronaviruses in general cause common cold and spread via resp secretions and droplets.So yeah, if someone was on the plane or in the plane you are at risk. I plan on wearing a N95 mask in the airports and on the plane as much as i can tolerate, also i may wear goggles. No drinks for me on the plane this trip"
I lived in Aruba for 3 years there is an extremely large Chinese population living there I would be very careful traveling there until things are under control.

"Less than 30 people from China come into Aruba each month. There are also no direct flights, so all flights come in through the US or the Netherlands where the passengers also go through screening. That's if the flights aren't already canceled. One chinese family was placed under quarantine out of an abundance of caution, even though they didn't meet all the criteria for being placed in quarantine. Aruba is one of the safer destinations in this regard I would say as there are minimal Chinese tourists, and the Chinese people that live here have all already traveled and back for Chinese new years and none show signs of the virus.Edited: 11:43 pm, February 15, 2020 "
Masks only prevent you from spreading your illness to others. Just wash your hands a lot!
Wrong. There is a large local population of Chinese and Filipinos living on the island. These folks have visitors and family members here regularly. Thousands of cruise ship passengers wander through the island daily from all over the globe.
"It is not just flights from China to be concerned about. There are many cruise ships that go to Aruba where passenger depart and enjoy the island. You can view the schedule for the port. Seeing how it is more widespread now in Europe as well, the concern is legitimate. It only takes 1!"
"Short of avoiding the few dedicated hotspots like Wuhan, how one would plan travel to avoid Corona virus? It spreads much like flu and, like flu, is quickly spreading worldwide by hitching rides on every possible person and surface. And by the way,the US has seen 16,000+ deaths from flu this season alone and more than 250,000 have died worldwide. It's just not newsworthy by today's standards."
"There are a number of steps you can take....like not going to Italy at the moment. If Italy is closing down towns and threatening 3 months in jail for anyone caught on the streets...I think this could be more serious than first though. I also think some governments are downplaying the risk- IE the US. The head of the CDC came out yesterday to contradict everything our President has said about the virus. I think this has many in the world worried and rightfully so. There are only a little over a 100 test sites in the world so accurately assessing what is going on is almost impossible IMO. I also heard that it takes so long to do the tests China is only testing 30 people daily- not sure if the last part is 100% accurate as I did not see that myself. With the lack of testing locations and questions about timing there is ZERO chance I would be going to Italy or China at this moment....and I am sure there will be many other countries added to my list in the coming days.Edited: 2:50 pm, February 26, 2020 "
I agree. This is a very serious situation that is changing by the day. People need to follow the advice of the CDC and go day to day.
"Yep Curly, as much as I wanted to listen tonight about the Presidents message was about the virus I decided to get my info from the CDC- they are here to protect all American citizens with no benefit for lying.....and no I am not being political."
Not sure what our president or the CDC has to do with the risk of travel to Aruba and getting infected by the Coronavirus?Has Aruba done anything about screening passengers on flights or connecting flights from China - or canceling them altogether? Are there any confirmed cases of the virus in Aruba?Those are the questions that need answers.
We are headed to Aruba on Monday. I am not worried about getting the virus. We plan to wash our hands diligently that day. Thereafter my doctor prescribed a daily exposure of at least eight hours at Eagle Beach (under a palapa of course). I plan to comply!
"Like I said before because some insist on the Chinese connection:The Chinese people that live here have all already traveled and back for Chinese new years and none show signs of the virus(Its been way longer than the incubation time already). Less than 30 Chinese nationals come into Aruba, per month. The risk here is lower than in the US, Canada, Europe etc. In regards to actual questions:1) Yes, Aruba screens all passengers and planes coming from risk areas. The Netherlands is our European hub, so planes departing from there to the island also get screened. Luckily, the Netherlands is also the only country left in Western Europe that does not have a confirmed Corona virus case. 2) No confirmed or suspected cases in Aruba at the moment."
Thanks ArubaGuy. Is your information based on reading local news or are you involved in healthcare in Aruba?
How does all of this handle the potential spread from cruise ship passengers?
"No Wally, I just keep up to date with local news. In particular the office of the minister of health and DVG(Aruban CDC)."
"In regards to cruise ships:Each cruise ship has medical staff on board that relays information a central database which is used by all ports of call. If any passenger shows signs of the virus, they will take the appropriate measures. Some cruise ships in the Caribbean have been denied entry, but have still entered port in other islands with no issue as of yet. Aruba has not dealt with any of these potential cases yet from cruise ships.Edited: 2:13 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Wrong. Look at the arrival schedule for Queen Beatrix airport. Panama, Curacao, Toronto, Bogota , Havana and St Martin are listed for today"
"What is your point Glenn? ""Wrong"", about what exactly? Not sure what the airport schedule has to do with anything. Most of the countries you mentioned have no confirmed cases, barring Canada."
"I’m going back to Aruba at the end of March... I’m medical healthcare professional, and I’m NOT in a panic about this at all. Even if you get this novel virus and are in decent health, chances are that it’s not going to kill you. People should be more concerned about the influenza viruses.Go..Enjoy. Relax!"
"While the amount of cases of the corona virus are extremely low when compared to the influenza viruses, the death rates are not even close. The death rate for the flu is .1% where its 2-3% for the corona virus. Lets all hope this goes away as quickly as it appeared."
"Me and my wife are planning to Aruba for her 50th Birthday in March. I'm worried about the news on Coronavirus and the discrimination of asian people. I asked this question on the other forum and got a favorable answer, but I just want to ask this in this forum as well.I am a Filipino-American from California. Do you see any discrimination of asian people in Aruba? I just wanna enjoy the island and celebrate my wife's birthday. Thanks."
"Joselito G - do you really expect someone to post on the board that they have witnessed firsthand, widespread discrimination against asians in Aruba?And if they did, would you believe it?And if this were true, would you expect this discrimination to be isolated to the tiny island of Aruba?Book your flight. Travel to Aruba. You will enjoy every aspect of Aruba, just like any other human on this earth would."
"all incoming flights are not pre screened by US standards if they originate in Bogata or the Republic of Panama or Suriname.or several other countries.Also tourist are flown into certain ports from all over Europe then piled into cruise ships that tour the islands...how well screed are they. Mien Schiff V is one. look it up my spelling may be off or check the port authority cruise schedule for the month..Edited: 2:50 pm, March 01, 2020 "
Are you concerned about how #Aruba is handling the current global #coronavirus #COVID19 pandemic threat? We have compiled a summarized publication to properly inform our guests and other Aruba-bound travelers. Please visit https:/…
That comment about the virus not being airborne is false. Droplets spread through the air when people cough and sneeze
Well then why are they saying not to buy them they're a waste of money and don't help?
"Surgical masks can help limit sick people spreading viruses but provide near zero exposure protection. N95 masks may provide some exposure protection but people often wear them incorrectly and your eyes are still exposed. You're better off washing your hands often and touching your face as little as possible.And why the focus on cruise ships in Aruba? The US has multiple major cruise ports attracting people from all over the world. Miami, Galveston, New Orleans, Seattle, LA, NY/NJ are all bustling cruise hubs in addition to river cruises along the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, etc. I'm not sure why one would be at any more at risk from cruise passengers in Aruba than in much of the US?"
I read that it is within 6 feet
How can you even compare COVID-19 to the flu? The flu has been around for years and the corona is fairly new. The stats on death rate cannot be compared at this time. So that comment is mute.
I did compare it to the flu but with new evidence have a whole new train of thought. The situation is scary.
There is almost always something going on. I am still going on my Trip to Aruba unless the airlines shut down. It's really no more dangerous than going to the grocery store in your hometown. It's not Ebola.
"I would like to hear from Rich B who started this thread...to see if you left in February. ? Our flight is scheduled to land at AUA on April 2.At this point we are in a ""wait and see"" mode.If there are no cases of Corona reported on Aruba at that time..we will go.The way I understand it, the air on the planes is sanitized, as it circulates. So I am not so much concerned with being on the plane.The Queue for the plane is another matter. Especially in the US, where passengers really squish up on each other in an unlikely style...I live in the Pacific Norhtwest,...Washington state, Seattle, are getting hit. And mid/southern Ca as well.So there is nothing super safe about being here unless we lock down and we are not.We are traveling 80 miles to see live music tomorrow night in a 700 person venue. Some of our friends think we are crazy.I will spare you the long story, but we are going to a show that is Important to us ;and an exceptional opportunity to see them. Lots of my friends are Done with attending any kind of public gathering,...theater, movies....we have cut back big time but this show we cannot miss...."
"We’re due to fly to Aruba in two weeks. One of my concerns is that we’ll be able to get there, but if one case of Coronavirus happens in Aruba while we’re there will we be allowed back in the U.S.? This could be a pricey quarantine. Thoughts?"
"My husband and I are Korean American. We will be going to Aruba in a few days from JFK for our anniversary. I’m worried about discrimination while we are in Aruba.

"We're scheduled to fly from Boston to Aruba on 3/19. I have a ""wait and see"" attitude and will likely make the trip unless forbidden to do so by some new government regulation. I don't relish the thought of being quarantined anywhere, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to get a little R&R in beautiful Aruba. I know that much of this is out of my control, but unless things change, I'll be there come hell or high water."
"We are scheduled to leave on 4/11, probably going to end up having to cancel since we are traveling with four 70+ adults who are scared"
Rachel K id like to extend my sympathy to you and your family for the ignorance of so many people. That’s a shame that you are looked at any differently because of peoples fear and ignorance. This virus doesn’t discriminate and can obvious affect any ethnicity. Sad world we live in that you must have that concern.
"We leave in two weeks. Myself, husband and 4 year old. So far we are still going but also willing to cancel if it doesn’t feel right or things escalate. I really don’t want to cancel and at this point we don’t see a reason to do so."
"We planned our honeymoon there, in late April, early May. Here's hoping we dont have to cancel."
"Packlitely, I think we are all evaluating the situation. Sadly this changes quickly and some drastic steps are being taken with limited warning. Here is another drastic step being taken by Israel.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that anyone entering the country from abroad —Israeli citizens and foreign nationals alike — must self-quarantine for 14 days. If you cant prove you will be able to do it they will not allow you into the country....The great thing is Aruba is still Corona free. Hard decision for many people traveling in the next couple of weeks for sure.Edited: 3:05 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Myself, my wife and two boys ages 9 and 4 are scheduled to fly out of Atlanta on March 20th and are currently still planning on going unless something crazy happens I guess."
"For the ones worrying about ethnic discrimination towards Asians, don't worry, we are way beyond that stage. Remember, the virus has far more connection to Aruba through the US and the Netherlands, than it does through China or any other Asian country. The virus is already ""everywhere"" we do business with and people understand its only a matter of when, not if. The tourism association and the government of Aruba have setup a safe area where visitors that show symptoms can be brought to and tested. The department of health also setup 42 rooms for isolation should it be needed.Edited: 6:39 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"No, Covid is not new. Just a new strain as in the Flu has a new strain yearly!! Media is ramping this up to be some Calamity that is not!!"
My partner and I are scheduled to fly out of Philly in early April. As of now we plan on going unless something drastically changes but I have thought of cancelling and moving out the dates to a later time. The media is really amping this up and scaring everyone and it seems to be working. Going to Aruba is very exciting and it’s a shame this virus has to lessen the excitement.
"My thoughts on this tonight:Center for Disease Control [CDC} lists the following for Symptoms of Coronavirus:CoughFever Shortness of Breath.That's it. !!If you look up Symptoms for Influenza:I am not sure if Shortness of Breath is listed.Cough,fever,sore throat,muscle achesheadaches runny nose.Are All listed for ""the flu"". Common flu VRS: Coronavirus?First my grandson, then I caught a:coughfever { I had a fever for 5 days, kept it 102 or lower with Tylenol. and shortness of breath, that made me feel very fatigued.But neither of us ever had, the sore muscles, runny nose, headaches..???...Other family members contracted became sick also.Good News!We are All back up and running!!My question?Did we just run through Coronavirus.Yes. I think so.The only people being tested for it ....are Very sick.People are being tested positive for it north and south of us. I think a bunch of us have ran through it already.Edited: 10:01 pm, March 09, 2020 "
Planning on going to Aruba mid April for two weeks not sure what to make of all of this Virus stuff wavering on canceling and moving dates to later in the year. Maybe this is overblown we are in our early 60's pretty healthy no underlying problems but still would like to enjoy our vacation. Nervous on what to doSaturn
Did you go to Aruba? I have an Aruba vacation in May
We are still planning on going in Mid April I think as long as we keep in mind all the advice given we will be ok. Are you still plan on going in May?
"The difference between Flu and Coronavirus is if you're infected with coronavirus you could be infected and not show symptoms for several days. During that time, you are infectious to others, including the elderly and people with already low immune systems. it can spread like a wildfire.My advice is to keep your distance from the elderly and the immuno-deficient as much as possible (as you would if you had the flu). These people are vulnerable to the serious effects of the coronovirus, and they should be protected. If I were one of these people I definitely wouldn't travel, take a cruise, go to a movie theater, ride the subway, etc. etc. until this blows over."
"I just read your request I did go to Aruba with no ill effects but I left out of JFK airport and there were many people with N95 masks on. As of today there were 23 confirmed cases of Corona and one fatality in NJ. Our governor declared a state of emergency. While Aruba claims there are no cases I would suspect just like anywhere else folks that feel mildly ill did not self admit to a hospital. Also if I did contract it while away I am not sure if the health care system in Aruba is anywhere near what te US has to offer. I am also not sure if you had a confirmed case of the virus that they would just let you hop on the next plane out and come back to the US.Frankly if I had plans to go to Aruba at this point in time I would probably still go but I would be at an elevated level of concern today from where my concern level was back in January.I mentioned I teach hazmat and WMD which includes biologicals but I am by no means an expert. Having said that I know for a fact when you see someone sneeze into the open air without covering up those droplets depending on their size can stay suspended in the air for an hour. I haven't been able to find consistent information on how long the virus lives on a surface. Some say hours others all the way up to 5 days. Pick your poison.I always bring wipes on the plane and cover every possible surface including your seat belt buckle and straps and every other surface someone could put there hands on. When you disembark kepp your hands off the escalator you take to g through customs. Never use the tips of your fingers for anything I use the side of my knuckle to turn lights on and off or my knuckle to push a button in an elevator. Common sense is what you need. There is one area that disturbs me more is what I can't control, and that is who is doing the cooking in the kitchens of the restaurants. There is no way to know if any of them are sick or your servers. I am sure the restaurant industry will hate me for saying that. However I also realize you cant live in a bubble I always go out to dinner every night when in Aruba. For those that are elderly and out of shape ( you know who you are) that have other medical conditions I would weigh your options that is a personal call. I am sure everyone here is listening to the info coming out daily those with underlying medical conditions should be extremely careful. If you dont need to go out you shouldn't I would suspect that holds true for vacations as well. Sorry for the lengthy reply but lol you asked for it. Everyone should just take appropriate precautions and wash your hands constantly god rule of thumb is that you should never bring yor hands up above your shoulders ( if that is possible to do lol) this way you wont be tempted to rub your eyes, pick your nose ( yeah tell me no one does that lol) or pick up food before washing your hands. Another worry I have is fresh fruit and vegetables people pick up fruit look at it and then place it back down again. That might be an individual who just coughed into his or her hand. Real quick story I was in Costco last Saturday morning people were already on line with full carts i got on line and literally right alongside me a guy came up the side isle stopped right by my feet bent over and blasted a sneeze down towards the floor not even bothering to cover himself. I turned around and spread my arms like WTF!!!! he apologized and then went back down the way he came. You cant fix stupid"
"Our trip is scheduled for early May. We are both in our 60s. My husband is on immunosuppressants so we obviously have concerns. At this point we still plan to go but know that depends on what happens with Coronavirus in the coming weeks.Early February when we were first hearing about the virus we traveled to Vegas with no issues. I’m really hoping we don’t have to cancelled Aruba trip.Yesterday, Jetblue sent an email that outlined all they were doing to keep people safe.Edited: 7:59 pm, March 11, 2020 "
JFK passenger just landed in Palm Beach positive with Coronavirus. I think you have to worry more about air flight than actual destination. The virus lives on surfaces 3 days.
"We are scheduled to fly in to Aruba on Saturday. At this point, we are still going. I think that I am probably most concerned with the two flights we will be on to get there. They are both three hours long. I am a pretty ocd hand washer anyways and I have clorox wipes to wipe things down. I will be more cautious than normal but am hoping to go and have a great time!"
Im going to aruba first week of april im not worried
"what is the situation with travel Insurance? I assume if flights are still operating and you decide to cancel, you are out of pocket and insurance will not cover? Same with Airbnb and red week bookings? Hotels, you are at the mercy of the cancelation policy? I also read an article that the companies that provide the cancel for any reason insurance are not longer offering such. I have been mulling a trip for June/July, which I assume would be Ok, but who really knows so I have not pulled the trigger on such just yet"
"Rich b, remember that people on Aruba obviously will not go to a hospital if they shows symptoms, that's what you should not do!! All we have to do is call the hotline and they will verify if you need testing or not. 7 tests have been done so far with no positive results as of yet."
Based on what you said about immuno suppressants I would not chance it you describe the exact category for those most susceptable to have severe symptoms if the virus is contracted.
thats my point I suspect that most food servers dont get paid if they dont go to work. So mild corona symptoms will not be reported by them because their employer will tell them to go home and stay home which in small establishments mean they will not be paid. Also I always rent a car but how does anyone know when they get in a cab if the fare just before them had symptoms this virus is highly contagious. I know this doesn't bode well for the travel industry or Aruba which relies upon its tourism but it is what it is.
7 tests .....how many people live in Aruba? They only conducted 7 tests you just validated my hypothesis. Arubans are not reporting the possibility of symptoms. sorry I just have to disagree with you
"Just received word from our Aruba friends.The government just announced: 2 cases confirmed.One NY resident, one local.Schools will close effective Monday.flights from Europe banned effective Monday"
"Sort of stressing..we are scheduled to leave tomorrow. My group wants to push forward, I am inclined to cancel. Not for the worry of getting it, but the worry of not getting home. Sad times."
""" So mild corona symptoms will not be reported by them because their employer will tell them to go home and stay home which in small establishments mean they will not be paid.""If an employee is sick, they will get paid. That is the law."
Oceangirl I would be stressing as well. I have friends that say the only way they not going on their upcoming trips is if the airline cancels their flights. Sorry you are in the situation.
"Im in Aruba right now. Arrived from jfk to Aua Thursday morning. Security check in jfk wasn’t checking for people having coronavirus and so wasn’t Aua. Which is scary. While I was on the plane this ignorant person who was not wearing a mask seated behind me was coughing non stop without any attempts to block his projections during the ride. Also I would like to state that so far, people here are staring at me for being Asian and talking about us (I can hear them and referring to my husband and me) yet I see so many people just coughing and not covering their own mouth!!! I think people here are forgetting that just because you left USA, and just because There are only 2 confirmed cases doesn’t mean you should throw away your sanitary etiquettes.Edited: 10:56 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Rachel, I appreciate your post, we are supposed to go to Aruba in 12 days and I am on the fence. I've been looking fw to it for months, have no insurance, and it's non-refundable : ) I was hoping that possibly due to all of the cancellations that the plane would not be full and we'd have some distance between us but it sounds like your plane was full? Is that correct? Honestly, I think I'd freak if the person behind me was coughing up a storm too."
Did you end up going to Aruba after all. We are supposed to go in March 24th. Wondering what to do. Worries about getting stuck there.
"Ocean girl from Branford,Post 91,Where are you? the Canadian Government issued an official Global Travel Advisory March 13,for Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.Today March 14 it was on CBC that Foreign Affairs Minister Champagne now recommends Canadians return home while commercial transportation is still available. Hopefully you cancelled.If not hope you can get back home safely.Edited: 11:12 pm, March 14, 2020 "
There is 6 cases as of today. Factory workers at the water plant. All being quarantined as of now. Not sure when the cases started. We leave the 18th. Still planing on going. Our resort/timeshare has had no issues. Our friends are there now and some have already come and gone. Only thing would be to be prepared to home quarantine for 15 days upon arrival at home.
"Also, no Europeans are allowed on the island for a while. Cruise ships are banned and that really hurts that tourism economy, they depend those tourists. I’m sure the down town area will be very quiet. :("
6 now.
"Yes the plane was surprisingly full mtnlaurel84. If your young and healthy I don’t see why not, but I have seen some staff and tourist coughing! If you guys can rent a car and sanitize it that will also be a better option than ridding a taxi!"
We are set to leave for Aruba on tuesday. We have been self-quarantined for two weeks and are flying from the US. We have been so looking forward to our trip but are on the fence about cancelling. We fly to Aruba Tuesday and from Aruba to Curacao Saturday. Will we be able to fly from one island to the other now that there's confirmed cases?
"I can't understand why people can't reschedule thier trips? the more people who listen to these travel warnings and just stay home, the quicker we can get rid of this virus and start living normal lives again. You may be healthy and never get it, but you also may be a carrier and pass it on to someone with a compromised immune system. Plus, personally, I wouldn't want to get stuck in Aruba with this virus. If I needed medical attention from this virus, are the hospitals fully equipped? Can they handle a large outbreak? Plus what would the cost be to be treated if not a citizen of Aruba? How do you get home to be treated for this virus when flights have been cancelled to the US or Canada? These are things that people aren't thinking about. Just reschedule people simple as that."
Thank you!! Well written and only if people would follow that we would all be better off. Great post!
Well when my resort is not offering a full refund or rebate then what do I do?
Chalk it up to experience.
See the message board. No international visitors allowed in Aruba until at least 3/31. Your decision has been made for you. We're supposed to go 4/21. Not looking good
"I'm out $2400 and not getting any refund or an future credit. I don't have that kind of money lying around to simply ""reschedule"". any advice on how to get refunds or credits?"
How are you out 2400? With whom?
"Expedia! Been on the phone for an hour and 45 min. Their policy is that ""we follow the policies of our partners and are unable to make any refund or credit exceptions"". The hotel and airline we booked (through expedia) is ""no refund"" after a month before our arrival date, meaning Expedia can't refund us. Apparently ""global pandemic"" is not an exception. Probably my fault for booking 3rd party in the first place. This is rough"
"Well said !!! Reschedule, wait and see how things improve.....you safety and others comes first."

Not accurate. It starts today and ends (tentatively) on 3/31. Please check your facts before you post.
"We left last night. My wife's family is still there. They were told they can leave, but only if the airline companies send empty planes in to get them back to the US. How comfortable would you be with that possibility????"
"As of Tuesday March 17, no one can travel to Aruba from the USA. Sadly we had to cancel our trip leaving Wednesday the 18th :( I don’t know how long this travel ban will be for. They did say that there are still flights leaving the island. But being such a small airport, I can see those lines getting home now. We got a full refund on AA in vouchers up to a year of your purchase date. They will work with you. Good luck."
For those trying to leave Southwest has outgoing flights on their website every day. Not sure how long this will last. We did not plan to depart until May.
"We left yesterday a few days earlier than planned, just to make sure we could get home. Could not get our tics changed thru AA, so bought 2 more and flew SWA. Crews are flying in empty planes just to get folks back to the US. There is now a curfew, and many hotels, restaurants have closed. Everyone needs to stay home and stay safe."
thats incorrect depending on the size of the droplets when you sneeze they can stay in the air for up to an hour I teach hazardous material and wmd response. the larger droplets fall out of the air quite quickly while the smaller ones stay suspended in the air and travel with air currents. then they eventually land and fremain active depending upon the environment they are in experts vary from a few hiurs up to five days although many say about 2 days.
this is much more infectious than the flu and you typically have flu like symptoms when someone catches it from you. This virus you can have no symptoms and still be highly infectious.
American Airlines has suspended all service to Aruba till May 6 from my airport Philadelphia and several others. Check with your airline for updates.
