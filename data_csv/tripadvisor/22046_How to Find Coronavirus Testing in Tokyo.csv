"Okay, after a day of researching in English and Japanese, this is what we have come up with:Please note that these resources represent a “best effort” on the part of myself and other reliable and knowledgable expats and locals, including my bilingual wife, after a day spent prepping in case one of us (her, in particular) gets COVID-19 and I, with my limited Japanese, have to arrange medical assistance for her in an emergency.We want to share this information with you, and hope you will share it with others and add to it as more resources become available/first-hand experiences emerge.This is the best information we have found, as of Sunday, April 19, at 5pm. and these are the steps I will follow if I as an English-speaker need to arrange Conronavirus medical assistance for myself or my wife:MOST IMPORTANT: apparently as of Thursday, April 17, a new helpline with service in 14 languages was opened by the Tokyo Metro Government. The helpline is called Tokyo Coronavirus Support Center for Foreign Residents (TOCOS)The number is 0120–296–004The catch? It’s only open Monday to Friday, 10 til 5.https:/…008000cOTHERWISE, if I can’t get through or it’s evening/weekend hours, I will call the Himawari Medical Information Service. I have used them in the past to find (non-Coronavirus related) English-speaking medical support with reasonable success. Here’s the details:03–5285–8181Daily: 9:00–20:00Languages: English/Chinese/Korean/Spanish/Thaihttps:/…https:/…IF IT’S AFTER HOURS, there is a number for help in Japanese only, available from 5pm to 9am at 03–5320–4592. Note, however what Rachel Leng writes in her blog of her experience trying to reach this number.https:/…Again, Just to say, this is the best information we have been able to find in our combined English and Japanese searches online, on discussion boards, and previous experience.As I say, if you have first-hand knowledge of these or other useful services, please share the wealth! We're all in this together...I will continue to update the blog page at https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/how-to-find-coronavirus-testing-in-tokyo-for-non-japanese-and-japanese-speakers-852deba12351"

"Some other useful information on the situation and resources in Tokyo:https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/Not surprising that the largest numbers are based on the densely populated central wards.Having tangled with the Japan medical system on a few occasions over the last decade, the most important thing is to not get sick at the weekend or outside ""office hours"". It is very difficult to get assistance even for potentially life threatening conditions."
"Whether it's Covid-19 related, make sure you have cash. Clinics often don't take credit cards. I found this out on New Year's Day when my partner had an emergency eye infection. The hotel was able to find us an open clinic. I just had to pull some additional cash from an ATM while she waited."
"""Whether it's Covid-19 related, make sure you have cash. Clinics often don't take credit cards. ""Thanks for the heads up! Curious on why many don't take credit cards these days especially in Tokyo."
"Maybe customs.It is important to avoid crowded places not to get infectious and take records of your temperature. Even you insist, they won't do PCR tests automatically.　The first four days, you just need to take good rest.Doctors cannot do anything at the initial stage.If it is really COVID 19, the bill will be covered by taxes. If not, you need to pay. If you're paying Kenko Hoken, 30 percent.Edited: 1:27 am, April 20, 2020 "
"I don't know how it is abroad, but in Japan credit card companies charge commission more than 3 percent. That might be why cash is more appreciated. BTW, the Japanese Government is promoting cashless giving bonus points by taxes, so it won't be a trouble to use credit cards at supermarketss and convenience stores, but some stores still have a policy that they won't take them unless it is more than 2000 yen or 3000 yen."
"#3 JapanCustomTours Thanks for the data source on COVID-19 in Tokyo! A lot of timely and detailed information from the Metro (?) government.#4 SammyFD: Thanks for the tip re: credit cards. I learned a similar lesson recently when I was short on the cash and tried to pay for a doctor's visit with SUICA (politely refused). I'm sure with time this too shall change...#6 Global715255 Good reminder about COVID testing payment. I assume the test cost is fully covered if you have national health insurance. Do you know if the same is true for people on private insurance, as many expats have? Also, I doubt there are few if any tourists left in Japan, but I wonder if they would have their test cost paid..."
"A couple of quick updates re: Coronavirus testing info in English for Tokyo:First, anecdotally, i have heard of success stories of people getting through on the new helplines, which is a big improvement from the past.However, I am also hearing, and agin this is only anecdotal (please share if you have recent first-hand experience) that the minimum symptoms for testing, at least in Tokyo, are a minimum temperature of 39 degrees and ""severe breathing problems."" I believe the standard was 37.5 for a minimum four days previously...Again, this only anecdotal data, a few friends and reports online, but it does seem that either the number of cases in Tokyo has indeed ""overshot"" the capacity to deal with them, or there is limited testing availability for whatever reason."
"Also, just a quick question: anyone familiar with The Association of Medical Doctors of Asia Medical Information Center? According to an April 9 article in The Japan Times, They ""will operate the service in eight languages between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Friday to May 20. The phone number for the hotline is 03–6233–9266.English will be accessible every day, Chinese on weekdays, while other languages including Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese will be available on designated days""https:/…The website in English and other languages appears quite useful for general medical assistance, actually, but there's no mention of coronavirus assistance, and note the info under the telephone number http://eng.amda-imic.com/"
"Medical interpreter seervice is something useful for checking, but IMO expats should study some survival Japanese to be able to say ""38 do no Netsu ga . . ""Hotlines are tremendously busy so don't bug them unless you have symptoms."
"#8Aaron, do you have a plan to leave Japan soon?If not, you are supposed to be in a Kenko Hoken.Unless you are waived to be enrolled, it is against the law not joining it.https:/…"
"My situation is fine, Global715255. I was thinking of the needs of other people, such as those expats on private health insurance or the few travelers who are still apparently in Japan and may need testing...Do you know if their tests would still be covered?"
"People who have entered Japan after April 3 are tested at the airports.Those who came to Japan before that need symptoms to be tested. It is not you or the travellers who decide to take the PCR tests, but the healthcare authorities or doctors.There was a European who tested positive. She was staying at Kawasaki and she travelled Kanazawa and Kyoto.You don't need to do mind games. Medical care should be for those who really are in need.Edited: 4:02 am, April 21, 2020 "
Most non-Japanese people from severely affected countries will not be allowed to enter Japan even they are not infected.
"Even not severely affected, 73 countries are not allowed without exceptional reasons.https:/…page4e_001053.html"
"""People who have entered Japan after April 3 are tested at the airports.""Is it via just temperature or full blown test?"
"PCR tests.Basically people from 73 countries are not allowed to enter. Don't forget that point. They are testing the people returning from those countries.Edited: 12:18 am, April 22, 2020 "

"Put priority on prevention and study survival Japanese.Take record of your temperature. Consult with your doctor, who could connect you to PCR tests when is necessary if you're the patient. Your anxiety won't lead you to the test. You need doctor's or health authorities' recommendation. The capacity of hospitals is quite limited in Tokyo and many cases of hospital infections are happening.I don't understand why you think your wife cannot call the places if she gets infectious, Aaron.Edited: 10:27 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"In the US, the CDC’s failed coronavirus tests were tainted with coronavirus, feds confirm. Read the article. The tests are worse than the disease. Don't you all want to get back to work? Don't be fearful people."

"#20 Global715255, I find it best to prepare ahead of possible crises. We both feel better knowing I can handle she situation if she can't.And if I feel better knowing what to do, then so will others in a similar situation - bilingual wife or not :-) That is why I published How to Find Coronavirus Testing in Tokyo for Non-Japanese Speakers :-)BTW, I think preparing a list of Coronavirus words and phrases in Japanese is a good idea..."
"I'm not sure what you mean by the CDC's PCR tests. Did something happen just like the incident of Narita Airport where they couldn't carry out the test for a while because the officier spilled the test liquid on the floor?I believe the PCR tests in Japan are trustworthy but there were human errors telling the negative people that they were positives and vice versa. Some people couldn't have funerals of their loved ones because of that mistakes.4 out of 67 people who were tested when they entered Keio University Hospital for other diseases turned out to be positive on COVID 19. Tokyoaaron, it is NOT you who makes the diagnosis if you have COVID 19 or not but THE DOCTOR. It's not coronavirus words but for flu or cold whatever. It is a good chance for you to learn some basic Japanese, such as I have a fever is ""Netsu ga arimasu."" I have a headache is ""Zutsu ga shimasu."" If your wife lose consciousness, you need to call an ambulance, telling, ""Tsuma no ishiki ga naindesu.""Learn how to say numbers like Sanjuhachido ３８C.Please get me a medical interpreter is ""Iryo tsuyaku, onegaisimasu, please.""In the case you're positive, you will put into a room with other COVID patients who could be coughing the whole day, not any paradise unless you paid for the private room and there are vacancy, which might not be the case.If you have a fever you could ask for Avigan, which works to lower your temperature but has a risk for the next generation so pregnant women shouldn't use it."
"If you want to be prepared, study the Japanese words instead of being obsessive of PCR tests. If you have symptoms of pneumonia the doctor could order CT scans and see if PCR tests are necessary even CT scans are expensive.Once you get to the hospital you can ask for medical interpreters but it would be better for you yourself to be able to explain your symptoms in Japanese."
"""The tests are worse than the disease""It doesn't seem that way with the current results."
"This is the article that Aussie_bushman wrote about.https:/…I don't think it will happen in Japan, but a lot of hospital infections are going in many hospitals in Japan."
