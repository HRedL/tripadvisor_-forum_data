What is the current situation of bed bugs in HK hotels? I know there is a general problem but is it on the increase just now? Thanks
Have not heard of bed bugs being an issue in Hong Kong.
>>bed bugs in HK hotels[...] is a general problem[citation needed]
"I wouldn't have heard of such a problem if I didn't read about it here ...midges and mosquitoes out here in the far New Territories, yes, but bed bugs?"
"Apparantly, there may be an epidemic on its way;scmp.com/lifestyle/health/article/2098227/hoâ€¦"
eww :-(
"Thank you for your responses - so may be a problem, but not yet really serious......"
Have not heard of this issue previously. I wouldn't be concerned at this point.
Have not had this as an issue in the various hotels I'very been in. Check the TA reviews for your hotel and do a search for bugs.

"#9 looks like a plug for bed bug removal service. Cannot find any information on ""certified"" hotels."
I didn't hear about the bed bugs in HK hotels
not a great problem in Hk - could be with hostels and very low priced accommodation
Never heard of it
"""tick box"" lol good one."
"It would be if it were about ticks... Those silly unintended puns really bug me.Anyway, the suggestion was to read the reviews. Not to tick a box in the search options."
