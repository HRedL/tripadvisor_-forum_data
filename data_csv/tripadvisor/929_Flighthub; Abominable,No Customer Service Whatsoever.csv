"I've been a longtime customer of flighthub but no longer. If you email them ,it is very difficult to even find an email address-I sent one to get a very unhelpful response which is to call them. I see that customer Service is nonexistent period! They tell you to call them at one of their numerous numbers. When you do call,they keep you on hold & just do not answer whereby you just hang up-I was waiting over 2 hours-all you get is music! There is no customer service. I'm going to report this to the Better Business BureauI will never use this company again"
">>> I'm going to report this to the Better Business Bureau <<<On what basis? Flighthub and similar online booking services only exist to sell you a ticket, which they have done. They are not there to provide you with a customer service experience.Unfortunately people who book with these services to get low prices find immense difficulty when flying gets seriously disrupted - these services don't have the resources to cope. If you want customer service, book directly with the airline you wish to fly with."
"very few on the online ticket floggers provide a good customer service - people want cheap price, they make virtually nothing on selling flights so cannot really afford to provide a decent service without it reflecting on their prices (people don't choose them because they are good, they choose them because they see a cheap advert)Add together the number of people that are affected by cancelled flights all trying to get their issue resolved and you just need to be patientPeople are struggling to get through to airline's too....this is not an everyday situation. Not sure whether it is practical to expect these companies to magically increase their call centre staff (100 times current workforce likely still not enough to deal with demand...where do they sit, what infrastructure do they use, when do they get trained?)Are you due to travel in the next 48 hours? has your flight been cancelled by the airline?"
">>>People are struggling to get through to airline's too....this is not an everyday situation.<<<Carol; has hit the nail on the head. This is unprecedented. There's no way that a ticket flogger like Flighthub operating on thin margins is going to be in a position to throw massive amounts of resources into their custom,er service operation to be able to cope better. I don't imagine that a complaint to the BBB will bother them at all."
>>> I'm going to report this to the Better Business Bureau <<<Waste of time ..they have plenty of complaints to BBB. One more will not break the camel's backhttps:/…flighthub-0117-47394
"Anyway,I spoke to Better Business Bureau-they said they've had so many issues/problems with flighthub that they now refer everyone to better business bureau of San Francisco. They said the addresses flighthub uses-for instance one is listed in Montreal does not exist-all false.Then I spoke to my insurance company & they said they have nothing but problems with flighthub & warn people not to use them"
"""they said they have nothing but problems with flighthub & warn people not to use them""So pretty much the same as the thousands of other answers on here when ppl complain about these third party ticket floggers."
"The BBB has absolutely no power to do anything. It’s a waste of time to file a complaint with them.Edited: 10:05 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Then what do you suggest. Calling Flighthub doesn’t work,they don’t answer period. There is no email address. They grab your money & that’s the end of it. No customer service,nada."
"If they've been okay with contact up until now, you should surely realise it's the special circumstances with Covid-19 that make it difficult."
"I’m surprised that someone with over 700 posts on TA was seemingly unaware of flighthub’s stellar customer service record. A quick scan of TA will show that they are right up there....or should I say down there with Travelgenio, Opodo, Kiwi, etc, etc."
"airpizz6-touche; you're right. I've never cancelled before. I'll know better next time.Centralvic-yes,these are certainly scary times & definitely true that with this pandemicit is challenging reaching someone"
"My insurance company did say that it is always better & this is what they advise,that you deal directly with a hotel,airline etc rather then go through another party"
"I’m truly sorry for those who have lost family or friends to this virus and for airport, airline and other staff who are losing their jobs as a result of the travel restrictions.My only hope is that the difficulties so many are experiencing having chosen to book through these dreadful ticket floggers will u derstand why the advice is to book directly and will do so in the future. A few of the shonkies going bust would be a bonus. I suspect though that when this is all over, more will come along to take their place in the race to the bottom."
My suggestion is do your research BEFORE buying a ticket.
