"We are supposed to be staying in the river walk next weekend just for a fun little getaway. My young boys are coming and honestly if I have to deal with keeping masks on them and keeping up with their masks- well, the trip is supposed to be relaxing and not a source of stress. How is it down there? Is the atmosphere tense? Will we get hassled? Should we just go to the beach instead?"
"It's the same as anywhere I guess. There's more positive cases. Governor is trying to open Texas up: individuals cannot be punished for not wearing a mask. Mayor and County commissioner trying to impose restrictions by fining businesses that don't enforce social distancing/mask wearing. Zoo is open, several museums (including the DoSeum) are open(ing) up (with restrictions.) There are protests happening in touristy areas (very little violence.) These are crazy times. Come on down but pack some patience. Don't look for problems, and things should be great.As to going to the beach, that's more of a personal question. I get bored at the beach and enjoy doing things in a larger city, But a beach vacation is probably more relaxing. Have fun which ever you choose."
"I walk every morning on the museum reach of the riverwalk. I see some people wearing masks, but most of us who are running or walking for exercise don't. An outdoor restaurant/bar I frequent rarely has anyone wearing one, but that's going to change by Monday. They do say if you're 6 feet from other people, you're not required to wear one, but their staff will have to or they will get fined."
"We have been to the river walk a million times and this is just a little getaway. I’m hearing stories of places separating families w young children as they use restrooms and just other giant hassles for parents. I am also worried about the protesting- is it safe? It’s just me, very pregnant, my mom in her 80’s and 2 young kids do not in any position to be adventurous lol. Will we have to wear masks in the hotel? Oh, maybe we will just go to the hill country."
"As of Monday 6/22 through 6/30/2020, all Bexar County businesses are required to require their customers to wear face coverings. Bexar County is currently experiencing an increase in COVID cases. Personally, I would not want to go there right now, especially with an elderly person, a pregnant woman, and small children. if you can't postpone your trip, I would say the Hill Country would be a lot safer than the city right now.Edited: 12:54 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Protests have pretty much died down and certainly nothing violent recently. I agree though, I wouldn't be coming her right now if I didn't have to you, huge spikes in cases this week."
"face masks aren't mandated for children under 10 years old (that's my understanding...the rules do change often so correct me if I'm wrong here). I don't think anyone is going to harass little kids for not wearing masks. That being said, I agree with everyone above.I have a friend who just made a reservation at the La Cantera resort, on the north side of SA, for this coming weekend. I think young kids would be pretty happy there, with the resort style pools and grounds. She got ""a great deal"" (according to her, we didn't talk $$). Something like that seems way more relaxing... You could still venture downtown for a few hours and visit the River walk, if it looks like things are calm and serene down there?"
And so it goes with everything else this year. We will head out to Fredricksburg instead although from what I can see it is going to be packed with everyone avoiding San Antonio. Sigh....
"Sigh indeed. Such a pest this virus.Edited: 2:50 am, June 20, 2020 "
"I personally would skip going to anywhere in Bexar County. Not worth the hassle, thanks to the Mayor of San Antonio and County Judge. Head to the beach.Edited: 10:25 am, June 20, 2020 "
"In response to Post #9, several cities' mayors and County Judges have enacted restrictions (usually the wearing of masks) to deter the recent increase in the spread of COVID-19 in our state. I personally would avoid going to the beach, as virtually no one wears masks at the beach. If you can bear the inconvenience of wearing a mask as you enter every shop, restaurant (where you are allowed to remove it while eating), etc., it's a minor inconvenience to ""suffer"" to help prevent the spread of this virus. You won't need to wear masks while walking on the Riverwalk or in Market Square, but will need to wear them as you enter the various stores."
Not a whole lot is open yet on the Riverwalk. Boudro's for instance is saying early July.
"If you're pregnant, the beach. The Riverwalk will be nasty hot.This is the covid-19 report for Corpus Christi and Port Aransas.https://www.cctexas.com/coronavirusEdited: 2:35 pm, June 22, 2020 "
"The beach is a great idea, but if you're from Memphis, don't come to Texas for the beaches if that's all you're going to see. Texas beaches are fine, and great for locals, but I don't see them as a destination for people from out-of-state.Edited: 10:59 pm, June 22, 2020 "
