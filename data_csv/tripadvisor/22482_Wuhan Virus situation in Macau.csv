"Starting from Monday (27 Jan 2020), Macau authorities require all visitors from Hubei Province to show medical proof that they don't contain the deadly virus upon entering the city.The former Portuguese colony said all non-Macau residents who come from Hubei, or have been to the province in the past two weeks, need a doctor's certificate so they can enter Macau.It added that it's also asking some 1,100 Hubei travellers currently in Macau to go back to the mainland on their own while they don't show any pneumonia symptoms, or risk being sent to isolation centres.Also from Monday, people who visited Hubei in the past 14 days have been banned from entering the casinos in Macau.Source - RTHK - https:/…1504980-20200126.htmSimilar measures are being taken in neighbouring Hong Kong.

"Question is how the Macau authorities can know for sure whether someone has been to Hubei Province in the past two weeks.Edited: 3:14 am, January 27, 2020 "
"RE: ""Question is how the Macau authorities can know for sure whether someone has been to Hubei Province in the past two weeks.""Don't be resting so comfortably that this question can be evaded. Macau SAR is now part of China, Macau Immigration can very well have inquiry access to China's database on all foreign visitors. All visitors to China, on passport or on ""Home Return Permit"" (from Hong Kong or Macau), are required to register with the police where they are staying everyday during their travel. You probably may not have registered the details yourselves. But all hotels do that on your behave for the duration of your stay per their government's regulations."
#4Great guess. Thanks.
"To answer my own question in #3, each Hong Kong immigration official would display a piece of paper, with the question ""Have you been to Hubei Province in the last 14 days?"" printed on it, to every incoming visitor. As long as the visitor says no, they will be stamped in, according to the last news round up by TVB Pearl.I guess the Macau authorities are following the same practice."
There are reports that the Macau Authorities are tracking down known residents from Hubei and escorting them to the border to leave the Macau immediately or go directly into quarantine for 14 nights. https:/…

"It makes perfect sense to me. Do you want to be nice, or do you want to try to prevent the spread of a deadly disease and save lives?Seems fair to me."
"With an incubation period of two weeks, the disease is potentially already everywhere.So there’s that.Two, Macau already let these people in. Shouldn’t have let them in if you’re going to turn around and eject them a day or two later.If you were one of these Hubei travelers, I doubt you’d be too happy now."

Suspending all travel in from China for Chinese nationals.... now they are getting serious.Doubt we will be seeing a tourist tax anytime soon either....
"#15-if it upsets you, don't read it. It was posted b/c it indirectly applies, as the OP asked if it was safe to travel, and HK and Macau have multiple transportation links. It's a big deal for United to suspend these flights, for whatever reason given. Why you fear pertintent information is puzzling.Edited: 9:19 am, January 29, 2020 "

"Thanks Brad!RE: ""Some other reports that the casinos look like ghost towns right now.""It didn't surprise me at all. Even when I was there in Macau in December, most hotels/casinos were not that busy. That was in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Normally it would be quite packed. All because of the HK protests. Now combine that with the virus...Chano-Tiano reported that there was only 1 person ahead of them at Immigration when traveling from HKIA to Macau via the bridge, in broad day light! Unheard of!Macau will survive this. We all are going to survive this. I don't want to see Macau being supercrowded as in unmanageable. But I wouldn't want to see businesses/hotels fold like in Detroit."

"I've been in Macau the past week, it's a GHOST TOWN.According to the Macau tourism boss, 5 star hotel occupancy rates were in single digits from 2/15 to 2/21.The average room rate during that period was $690 MOP, the lowest it's been in a decade! She now said they are working on recovery plans for the tourist sector, which will include consulting hotels and travel agencies.One thing I'm confident they won't be discussing: a tourist tax!!Maybe every cloud does have a silver lining!"
"MavenofMacau, It is a little bit better this week than two weeks ago. Shuttles from HK were running only every 30 minutes on 12 Feb and when it left, there were only 7 of us on the golden bus. I stayed at Studio City (silly cheap rate), in two days I saw one other person who I guessed wasn't a hotel staff. Took 180 degree photos at Venetian and in front of the Strip with no people, day and night. As you say, it was a ghost town. I doubt it will ever be possible to encounter sights such as those. Yesterday, things are a bit better but I think it much more due to the Macau residents starting to come outside, not really tourists. Shuttle buses seem to be running every 15 minutes again between HK and Macau at HZMB. And there was actually a queue at the immigration counter upon arriving at Macau. Taipa was scary dead two weeks ago, now a dozen or so people walking around, eating in whatever restaurants bother to open. The hotel I'm staying at actually has other guests. To be honest, I've never hotel rates like these before with the Cotai properties, the rates of peninsula area properties were definitely back to pre 2010 rates as well a couple weeks back, they seem to be creeping back up this week but still much lower than what you would normally expect. Tourist tax? I have a feeling they have hit the pause button on that one."

"Mac (or Miguel C or whatever you calling yourself these day)TA forum posting guidelines are for you to post to the correct forums. You are a DE and know this. Basic and standard forum etiquette is to stay on topic for which your post about Las Vegas was clearly 'off-topic'. Given your posting history, it is quite possible that you don't understand this so I'm simply pointing it out to you. In regard to your statement suggesting that nobody else is allowed to post here - you can clearly see that others including yourself, have already posted to this thread unabatedly in the past.
