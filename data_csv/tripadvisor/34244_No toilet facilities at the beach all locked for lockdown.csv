"Please be aware if you are thinking of coming down to the beach in Eastbourne all the toilets are locked up There are also no cafe's open only drive thru Mc Donalds , KFC so no loos there either. Im not sure if the supermarkets toilets are closed but my guess is that they are. Someone may be able to update this.The governments current advice is very grey and confusing and as the lockdown is being relaxed and allowing more leisure freedom then these basic facilities need to be opened. Yes we all need to take hygeine precautions, maybe carry hand gels etc but the council needs to start making plans to open these facilities. Just my opinion as a local tax payer."
"Maybe the local council is ""making plans"", but hasn't been able to enact them in a safe way yet. They still have to protect the employees who will be staffing and cleaning them, and cleaning regimes will need to be enhanced."
Some councils who have asked people to stay away have also made the decision to not open toilets as a way of deterring people
Although it is inconvenient having no toilet facilities is one way of ensuring most visitors are fairly local and aren’t driving too far from home.Cleaning toilets is a pretty grim job at the best of times but for now I would say it is also dangerous. So until it can be done safely I’d say leave them closed
"Setting aside that it's a grim job that I wouldn't want to do, and so many don't feel like they've been cleaned at all (the punters'fault, I know), why does it have to be more difficult now? Surely cleaners wear gloves anyway and cloths etc are either disposable or laundered afterwards. Just shut the building while they are being cleaned, then open up again. Not coming face to face with any customers, so no need for masks or any other PPE. The risk would be on the public opting to use them, not the cleaners.Edited: 5:22 am, May 17, 2020 "
"As Annabell says, vistiors should be relatively local coming out for their exercise.Our one toilet open on the sea front means that people are encouraged with social distancing and not unthinking or unknowingly being close to other strangers.Many of the public toilets in our area are supported and cleaned by retired or invalided locals to help with the tourist industry and people travelling.Don't know about Eastbourne but the national supermarkets here have someone outside or are locked. You are supposed to go in, straight round to collect your essential shopping and out again back home."
"Maybe a market here for self cleaning loos, like ones I encountered in France and Japan.Of course expensive"
"Lovely idea TravelSmith but our councils have already been so short of money that they closed a lot of the toilets, especially on the sea front.There's been a lot of anger locally and protests to no avail."
My understanding of the current rule is that you can drive anywhere as long as you return home the same day. If you are going to make things that open then you need to provide facilities. Also what about delivery drivers and service engineers. They need loos too. High Annabelle long time no see hope you are keeping fit and well. Got any clotted cream or pasties to spare.
"Hi techno, I got very excited as my favourite pasty shop opened on Thursday last week. Unfortunately didn’t go that day, then hubby got called back to work the next day (he’s been furloughed I’m working from home) so still not had one! Frozen bake at home ones just aren’t the same! But on the subject of travel, just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. And the message still from us is #come back later.And delivery drivers don’t normally use sea front loos, I’m sure there is some provision made for them in places they deliver to and the truckers services are still open down here.Edited: 8:43 am, May 17, 2020 "
It’s been pretty well documented that the virus does not spread thru poo. I ran into this situation on a beach here it is pretty foolish as sun open spaces and clean air are also known to be bad for the growth and spreading of the virus. Another over reaction. People and authorities really don’t have a clue as to what they are doing.
I think the authorities here are doing a much better job than your president John. But if you don’t like it here don’t come. You won’t be missed
"A really foolish post. Why so cranky? I don’t see why you would result to foolishness rather than point out why you feel it is good to lock rest rooms up, while I think it is wrong."
I have already said why I think it is a good idea not to open toilets. It should encourage people not to stray too far from home.
"Well that was much more thoughtful. It really takes no more effort to play nice, does it?"
"#6They tried those self cleaning loos in various places, but they cost just as much to maintain as ""normal"" loos, plus, in some areas the local drug addicts found them convenient places to shoot up in."
"Along the coast a bit, Camber Sands car parks and facilities are still closed. Some local reaction: https:/…camber-battens-down-the-hatchesNoticeable increase in traffic - both car and pedestrian - evident on our exercise walk around Winchelsea today. As for bikers, as busy as any Sunday, I’d say. Mike"
">>It’s been pretty well documented that the virus does not spread thru poo<<Really? Citation please, because I don't remember anyone sying that with any certainly round here, and it seems very up in the air to me - as in we don't know and there is reason to assume it might - with SARS previously having shown an enteric involvement - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668196 - and decent quantities of qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401374 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406522 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142773Yes I know the limits of qPCR vs infectivity - which is why I use the phrase up in the air.You also have the issue of surface persistence on non-porous surfaces in a dampish environment which very favourable conditions for survival.Now whether that's enough to add to the general health risk assessment of having to deal with the assorted faeco-oral bacteria and viruses is dubious to me, so I also lean to the fact the closures are to discourage visits."
"Well, I know that up here on Merseyside the toilets and car parks at the beaches (yes, believe it or not, we do actually have a few beaches oop here!) have been kept closed by the local councils. In particular Sefton Council, which covers the beaches at Crosby, Formby and Southport, because they don't want hundreds of people all flocking there (maybe apart from locals where the beaches are on their doorsteps!), There's also no lifeguards on patrol, but over on the Wirral the RNLI have had to be called out several times to help people stranded on sandbanks. Now, if these people were local they would know the tide times, but these people had travelled from wherever they had come from, weren't familiar with the tide times, didn't familiarise themselves with the tide times, and therefore not only put themselves at risk but also the volunteers from the RNLI. Why can't people just wait a few more weeks when things will hopefully start get back to normal? Then we can all go out and enjoy the beaches, buy an an ice cream, sit in a beer garden with a pint and spend a penny in a toilet without putting peoples lives at risk! We're all in this together, but a selfish minority just want to spoil things for everyone else! P.S. it doesn't help that the government have given out ridiculous advice that you can now drive as far as you want to ""exercise""! P.P.S. does sunbathing on a beach count as ""exercise""?"
"You can drive as far as you like to spend time outdoors, for example to sunbathe or picnic. You can go out as often as you like to exercise. They are not interdependent.Edited: 11:51 am, May 17, 2020 "
"Yes, I know! But why drive 50+ miles to a beach or wherever and there's no toilets, cafes, shops, pubs etc open! As I mentioned on another thread, we went for a short 2 mile drive yesterday afternoon to pick up some essentials (okay, it was some real ale from a pub!) and decided to stop off in a very large park (Sefton Park) for our ""exercise"", now that we were allowed to drive somewhere for our ""exercise""!But there was nowhere to park (which didn't stop eejits from parking all over the double yellow lines and all over the pavements!) the toilets and cafes were closed, so we drove straight home without going for a short walk in the park. Basically, right now I would ignore any advice given out by the circus, I mean government! Forget staying ""alert"", just stay home for a few more weeks! Oh, and don't send your kids back to school next month because Eton, Harrow and Winchester aren't reopening until September!"
Thankyou I was hoping to drive here for my birthday in few weeks are any ice cream places open ?
"Matt, for all that Sefton Park is a very fine place I rather doubt that anyone would drive 50 miles to exercise there. Chances are that all the parked cars belonged to people like you who live in Liverpool. If some of them had headed further afield and managed to find somewhere less crowded (not necessarily easy) it would have been better all round.And as to a few more weeks, did you see the report yesterday that if R is 0.9 it will take seven years to eliminate the virus.Edited: 5:59 am, May 18, 2020 "
"'Oh, and don't send your kids back to school next month because Eton, Harrow and Winchester aren't reopening until September!' I wonder if they still have to pay fees? or will it be written off against some form of tax benefit."
"Surely, like other viruses (flu) are never eliminated, but they hang around?As discussed on another post, there are things called Shewees, which as the name suggests, are neat little contraptions for enabling women to pee like men into a container. Mush used at festivals and long distance hikers. I have used one in my car when I had the need.....If you need to visit a beach that much, then buying a few of these (available online) would be a good idea!"
"Debs, I walked up the seafront today and Fusciadi's the Italian Icecream parlour 50 yds left of the pier as you look towards the sea or east of the pier. Just below the pier left stairs, there is a take away icecream/ cofee shop which i think was the old Perry Winkles seafood shop. Also 50 yds west (left) of the wish tower lifeboat station on the seafront there is take away coffee and drinks available probably ice cream too. Still no loos open"
Got short by this.Went for a walk somewhere different 8 miles from home and had a cup of tea with a friend (8ft apart) and the shopping I can only do there had to be abandoned. I was desperate for a loo.Happily wasn't delayed on the way home!
"Given that the 'lockdown rules' permit us to take exercise outdoors. Given that fact, surely on health grounds the Council's Public Toilets should be open. Are they open yet and if not why not?Many thanks."
"To look at it another way, don't travel so far from home that you have to rely on public toilets."
"""surely on health grounds the Council's Public Toilets should be open""Yes, on health grounds the toilets are closed. It was one of the first things that happened. You can't social distance in a toilet block, it's ripe for disease to spread and someone has to clean them. And this isn't flu. It has a long incubation of 14 days while you feel well. suddenly causes multiple organ failure which our medics can't effectively control. Young and old alike.It also lives and is viable for a much longer time on hard surfaces.Take care. Use hand gel like it''s going to make you look young and lovely especially before eating finger food."
"When shops open next month, their cafes and toilets will still be closed."
"As we're now allowed to travel, facilities need to be open. There is absolutely no difference cleaning toilets now. I would hope cleaners have always worn gloves and yes temporarily close while cleaning. Sick of the bollocks re traveling and far and to the seaside. If you're scared stay in. That's your shout but don't criticise those that want to get on with life equally."
"Have you not been watching the news lately? We can go out all day. Museums, shops etc are opening in the next few weeks. If you're scared stay in forever. I have no issue with that, but for millions this is not living, so stop making it up as you go along"
"Why shouldn't you travel? If you don't want to, that's fine, but I personally want to get on with my life, so do what you want but don't stop others enjoying themselves."
"The reply buttons don't attach your comment to whatever message you're responding to.I wish you good luck in getting on with your life. As you say, it's personal choice. Some, however, might well find that their life is shortened or their health seriously impacted should they contract the virus."
""" I personally want to get on with my life, so do what you want but don't stop others enjoying themselves""I see Dominic Cummings has joined Tripadvisor."
"'but for millions this is not living, so stop making it up as you go along' The latter has been used often by those who fail to grasp the bleedin' obvious.The cries of 'X [government or organisation] don't know anything!', 'they're taking away our rights!', and 'why didn't they say B instead of A last week instead of changing their minds now - what's wrong with them?' are coming thick and fast from all sides.In some cases the person or agency making the comments is talking b*llocks which is that person's status quo, but in many other situations it's been a matter of what we know today is new information from that which we had three or four weeks ago.Sorting out the epidemiology of this virus and its effects on people has moved quickly, but as we started knowing precious little what's been put forth has had to change along with new knowledge and understanding of the situation. If that comes under the auspices of 'making it up as you go along' then so be it.'I personally want to get on with my life, so do what you want but don't stop others enjoying themselves.' If getting on with your life and enjoying yourself puts others at risk you may want to think carefully before acting."
"Langbus - brilliant!"" I personally want to get on with my life, so do what you want but don't stop others enjoying themselves.""No, it's you who want to stop others enjoying themselves by demanding what you want over others.Compromise. We are short of toilet cleaners. Perhaps you could help.Edited: 4:30 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"Bringing this debate back to East Sussex for a moment - my apologies - I hear that a frustrated Rye Cafe owner has taken matters into his own hands. Fed up with bikers/day trippers using his seating (in a non-socially distanced way and despite polite signage) whilst the cafe is shut, he yesterday took a chain saw to the picnic tables. They will be replaced with cafe style seating once he can reopen. Mike"
">>> As we're now allowed to travel, facilities need to be open. <<<No they don't. Life is not anything like back to normal, there are still a lot of Covid-19 infected people around (many of whom don;t know they are carriers) and the very real likelihood there will be a second spike of infections. You may be allowed to travel, but you must take into account that limited facilities will be available during your journey, and at your destination. Do not expect other people to risk being infected by you just so you can exercise what you consider to be your freedoms.Edited: 5:33 am, May 28, 2020 "
"This from David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford:""And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions. There are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel."" - The Guardian Online, 28th May 2020The full article:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…Edited: 5:46 am, May 28, 2020 "
"Quite. Being allowed to travel doesn't mean it's compulsory to travel to places like Eastbourne. My interpretation of the rather silly way the message was delivered is that you can travel anywhere you want to take your exercise, whether that's a walk, a run, mountain biking or whatever.It does not mean you must travel off to beauty spots and the seaside where facilities are closed. Or even if those facilities are open. This is not the end of term for the virus, although that seems to be what a significant number seem to believe."
We've had a surge here although most apart are still distancing and staying at home apart from a sojourn of less than 10 miles to walk somewhere different.A local hospital had to close because of being overwhealmed with cases. So people are coming to an area where it's just started up again.Two toilets are open. One for disabled in town (though nothing's open except 1 small supermarket the locals use and one on the seafront. Both would be fine for people out for a walk or driving to walk.Doesn't work for the 100's that came for a day at the seaside.
"I think that people relieving themselves anywhere but in a toilet is a health hazard. Nobody seems to mention this. I have a special key because of incontinence. It isn't deterrerring people look at the pictures last weekend. I carry anti bacterial wipes for doors and toilet seats,hand gel,hand wipes. Do seaside towns really want to create another health hazard. Covid19 will be with us until there is a vaccine. Live with it!!"
"She, as I've just written, toilet blocks cannot maintain social distancing or be sufficiently disinfected so are a double problem.It was being cited last night that these may never open but have to be redesigned and replaced.Individual toiltes ie just one, are open but you will have to walk to find it and maybe queue. As we are supposed to only be travelling for exercise as many times a day as you like - not going hundreds of miles for a full day out on a beach was not part of the COVID advice.Edited: 12:17 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"I don't understand the problem with social distancing in toilets. Block off urinals and keep cubicles. You may physically be within a couple of feet of another person, but with solid vertical walls between you surely that mitigates it? Again, block off some basins. Implement a limit on the number of people inside. Everyone will have to queue outside if necessary. Justice for women at last.Edited: 3:17 am, June 03, 2020 "
Who would control the number of people inside a public toilet?
The public toilets on Waterside in Stratford upon Avon have been open for some time now
