"A while back SeaWorld was doing test runs on Kraaken with the riders wearing masks. This morning I see that SeaWorld has added neck gaiters to their online store. They do seem safer if kinda warm for Florida.https://buschgardensshop.com/search… (ETA- I meant coasters, haven’t finished my coffee yet!)Edited: 8:13 am, May 26, 2020 "
"In researching mask options, gaiters didn’t fair well for germ spreading/containing because they don’t form a tight seal anywhere. But, most homemade masks are pretty terrible for that too. They do collect a majority of your droplets (talking, coughing, sneezing) though so better than nothing."
The masks are not to protect against the virus. They are pacifiers so the nervous nellies can feel safe when they have to go out into the real world. I hope Sea World can sell a lot of them. They need all the money they can get right now.
For goodness sake sunngod.We all know how you feel about masks by now.You are big and strong and won't wear one under any circumstances.We get it!!!
"Sunngod.. myself and my nursing colleagues have been strictly advised to wear masks every single day when doing our jobs.This is in accordance with UK NHS guidelines.. Masks help to keep us AND our patients safe.Are you telling front line health workers we are ""nervous nellies too""? MmmmPoster..can I ask what a coastet is? Thanks."
"She misspelled coasters as she says at the bottom of her OPshe means roller coasters Thanks to you both in your work for the NHS.Edited: 10:56 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Once again, I will highlight the best science on masks. This story references a recently completed University of Hong Kong study that proves the value of wearing masks - for everyone. One of the things I find most interesting from the study is the conclusion that if 80% of us wear masks, we can lift a lot of the lockdown. If only 50% of us wear masks, we are screwed.https:/…"
"I am happy to wear a mask all the time if we can get people back to work. Until there is a vaccine, if ever, we are going to have to change our behavior. The challenge to that is the American insistence on freedom to do whatever we want, no matter the consequences to ourselves, or anyone else. Look at the pictures from Lake of the Ozarks over the holiday weekend with throngs of people in the pool, bunched together without masks. Here in Phoenix, all the young invincibles are out crowding the bars again, sans masks. Unfortunately, there is not enough left of the Greatest Generation (WWII) left to smack us across the face and say ""get on the team"". That's what it took for the U.S. to win the war. I fear it's going to take a bad second wave of CV-19 to finally convince some people to get with the program. The people I know who've had CV-19 say that you don't want to experience the lingering health affects even if you've had a mild case."
"Agree Sammy. Unfortunately in this politically polarized climate in the US, the mask acts as a visual reminder that things have changed. With so many things out of control, people are in the stages of grief. Denial and anger are used to lash out at people wearing masks and asking masks to be worn at stores. There has also been some harassment of people not wearing masks. It’s all misdirected. The science does show cloth masks help reduce spread. You have attached another good article. The person arguing will not read the articles as they posted one in defense of not wearing a mask but did not realize it actually was pro mask. To all the public mask wearers, thanks for protecting me, I will do the same for you."
"Sammy, the problem is that study has many flaws. You can't simulate respiration by using a fan. The fact that it didn't stop it 100% should be proof enough that it doesn't work even in their scenario. The reality is that stopping a virus with a mask is like stopping mosquitos with a chain link fence. Even if your mask stops 50%, it doesn't stop 100%. The virus will still spread. Slowly, but the spread is still there. The virus won't go away until you reach somewhere around 70% infection rate. That is when lockdowns can be lifted. Knowing that it won't go away you either deal with it now or you drag it out. Had we let it run it's course, we would be done with it by now. Instead we are looking at having to deal with this for quite some time. Typical flu outbreaks are done by summer. We broke the pattern and are still dealing with it."
One more time. The virus cannot fly by itself. It does not have wings. It is transmitted in droplets. The Chain link fence mosquito analogy shows your ignorance of the science. No one says non surgical masks stop 100% of spread. Read that msn article you posted last month and clearly still have not read.
"I do not agree that the study is flawed. In fact, I think it's an excellent example of what will happen on rides at Disney, Universal and Sea World. We live in a world where we move and the air moves. I also disagree with your assertion that anything less than 100% isn't worth doing. Most of medicine is based on less than 100% success. Are we to abandon all medical treatment because it isn't 100%? Would you advocate abandoning all cancer treatments, just as one example? That is the logical extension of what you are advocating.Had we let it run its course, as you suggest, the death toll would be astronomical, which I do not think is a reasonable pathway through this. I am not willing to sacrifice my 90 year old mom just so we can get through the inconvenience of this faster. People in other countries are willing to wear masks, but we proud Americans don't want to be inconvenienced. Well, then, we are going to see natural selection at work. More of those smart enough to protect themselves will survive and the larger toll will be among those who do not. Unfortunately, part of the toll will be on our healthcare workers who are on the front lines. I have a hard time accepting that just because a portion of our population doesn't want to be bothered. That's where freedom ends, when innocent people have to pay the price for others' recklessness and selfishness."
"Here is the CDC position on masks before Covid 19.https:/…maskguidance.htmHere is the CDC position in the Covid 19 era. Many studies are cited.https:/…cloth-face-cover.htmlI don't like wearing a mask any more than I like jury duty, but both are part of civic duty on which a civil society depends. Maybe the issue is we are no longer civil nor civic minded."
"Sorry, but the masks are a joke. With the exception of the medical community who knows how to properly wear them, I've never seen someone wearing one that isn't tugging at it, pulling it down, wearing it around their neck, grabbing at it, etc. The masks are meant to make people feel better about themselves and make others think they care. These are the same people that are wearing disposable gloves while they pick through fruit, handle cash and then cross contaminate everything. The safest thing to do is stay home if you're sick or if you have a compromised immune system."
"The marks discussion will go on for as long as the virus is still here. I agree that the general public do not use them properly so they are a waste of time. Where we are in the UK I have seen very few people with them. And those that I have seen pull them down to smoke, snack or even to talk on their phone so what is the point. Thank goodness they are not compulsory here as they make you feel miserable. Of course they are needed in a medical setting but otherwise just keep your distance when outside."
"You must live in an area surrounded by morons then, kelsum. They are mandatory in my state and everyone seems to have figured them out just fine.It’s rude and selfish to not wear one. That cashier working minimum wage is stuck being exposed to your germs when you don’t wear one. Think of how many people they are exposed to. Then think of the germs they are carrying back home to their families. They do help. They do work. And it’s absurd that there’s so much handwringing from those that don’t understand science. It’s hardly a big imposition to wear a mask in the scheme of things."
"With respect to the original post, there is no reason to argue. If you are going to the theme parks, you are going to wear them in the near future. If you are not, then nobody is saying that you have to wear them, at least most places in Orange County.She takes time to post good info, and y'all turn it into an argument. Good, LordEdited: 1:04 pm, May 26, 2020 "
">>>Sorry, but the masks are a joke.<<< >>>I agree that the general public do not use them properly so they are a waste of time.<<<What happened to ""we have to believe the scientists/medical experts"" that so many have preached? The CDC says now and has said for some time that wearing masks in public is efficacious.Because some people anecdotally say people don't wear them correctly therefore no one should wear them is like saying because some people don't obey speed limits, no one should obey speed limits."
"Bchbetha, The fact is our supermarket staff are well protected. They have 6ft screens between each cashier, they have screens to separate them from customers.. They do not wear masks. I had to visit a hospital two weeks ago to have a tooth removed. Only people wearing marks were the dentists and they had full PPE as they rightly should. The receptionists, the other patients, no masks, the doorman and security, no masks. They were only deemed necessary for the nurses who were administering close contact assistance. Everyone was kept a long way from each other and that was all they considered was required. I was told that in most cases the mask was not used properly so it was better not to use them at all, just keep hand washing and maintain social distance."
"This is a travel forum about ORLANDO. What “UK Folks” are doing at home is of zero consequence and does not belong on this forum. Should you be allowed back in the US, you have to do what officials and businesses in Orlando dictate. Period. Deal with it or stay home."
"As a destination expert (No 24) I would jump off the soapbox ya standing on.Do you really believe what you have posted.If you do, you never get a job in Public Relations..........Just think if you, Sunngod & Piratemate all when out for a drink........what a entertaining night that would be.Mike....I like the Tipping post idea."
Well I will tip anyone wearing a mark as suffering in silence with that they deserve it.
We stay home then..
"surffish.The thing is, every single time there is a post about masks, a certain poster comes on and calls everyone who wears one ""Nervous Nellies""THIS is what starts arguments as they just won't let it go and won't stop ridiculing others.I simply don't understand what they get out of it and why they are so rude. Why on earth are they so bothered by people who want to/have to wear them?Edited: 3:12 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"“”Should you be allowed back in the US, ””Are you suggesting we may not be allowed back into the US??That being the case they’ll be further loss in the economy.."
The US will welcome the Brits with open arms. They need our money. The very fact that Disney has a dedicated holiday company for The UK shows how much business we bring in.

The three CMs in my family are already talking about how they'll enforce mask wearing. They are expecting Disney to take a firm line on this for CM's safety.
What about the risk of being hit by a mask flying off someone's face on a roller coaster? That seems pretty serious.
"That would probably be very effective if uniformly enforced. However, there are reports coming out of Disney springs that seem to indicate that enforcement has been difficult and in some cases sporadic. It seems that if you walk around with a drink in your hand, you don’t need to wear a mask or at least nobody bothers you about it. Restaurants will struggle with this too. I completely fail to see how any of these policies, be it masks or lockdowns, are to be effective if not mandated and enforced everywhere."
"All the vendors will be making money then. Everyone armed with a drink in one hand, ice cream in the other. Once they up the numbers I fail to see how they will enforce it as if many don’t comply they will never keep up."
Sorry Mike you have lost me. Earthquake??
You will need the mask off for hours to eat that lot. Is that your plan?
"Downtown Dis...oh, sorry Disney SPRINGS is more or less public property. It's harder to enforce there. I think the expectation in a park is most likely to be different. Your having to buy a ticket to enter a park gives Disney legal standing to set and enforce certain rules. There already is a bunch of small print on the back of your entry ticket receipt. This is just like every other public venue where you buy a ticket. There are rules for the ball game at the stadium, at the ski area, the movies...every ticket you buy comes with rules.I won't be surprised to see some addition from Disney Legal to say you agree to abide by additional health and safety requirements. Disney appears to be enforcing a strong policy in Shanghai. If Disney does not enforce a strong policy in the U.S., they are going to lose a lot of CMs, either to decisions not to return, or they just will not accept shifts. I expect the union folks will have something to say about this, too. And, Disney employees also have at their disposal filing OSHA complaints about an unsafe work environment. Unevenly enforcing rules can create legal liability if someone wants to try to sue over getting CV-19 at Disney. None of these are things Disney wants, which I believe suggests that we will be wearing masks, required to do hand sanitation, require distancing, etc."
"Yes, on the subject of legal liability, I’m of the opinion that as long as there is strict adherence to public health guidelines and a disclaimer on the back of a park ticket, any judge is sure to grant summary judgment...in a twilight zone!"
"There is a disclaimer here https:/…I cant copy it and I don’t understand legal sarcasm.Especially since we are definitely in a twilight zone.Edited: 8:08 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"Regardless of the masks and the disclaimers, the lawsuits would be allowed to move forward (and eventually settle).I’m looking at your response re twilight zone and I know you said you work in healthcare. Thank you for all you do!"
Thank you Rosen. Kind of you.
There is no question that Disney is worried about lawsuits. I'm sure Morgan and Morgan is waiting for any chance they can to sue Disney. Apparently Morgan's brother was hurt at Disney and they didn't get the proper settlement.

Looks to me like Joyce and Dean is using the site correctly and posting their trip reports in the right spot and they get like because people see their trip reports. They don't use this forum as a chat room so they have a low post count. I don't see anything wrong with it.
New update. Masks will not be required while dining or swimminghttps:/…

What a stupid comment Joyce and Dean. People don’t die in 5 minutes wearing a mask in 90 degree heat.
"Perhaps J&D need to think about all the key workers wearing full PPE to try and save the life's of people who have contracted the virusAs far as the amusement parks go what about all the staff who will be wearing masks, etc and all the staff dressed up as characters"

My husband wears one in 80-90 degree heat with high humidity all the time and does fairly strenuous labor while doing so. He HATES it but shows no sign of expiring any time soon and he’s 64.

J&DWhen I made the comment about key personnel wearing full PPE I was not thinking of people working at amusement parks but rather those working in hospitals hence the reference to saving people's lifes. People wear the full PPE in very uncomfortable conditions all the timeI am well aware of the high temperatures and humidity at theme parks in Florida as we have been there as well are many other such destinations in the summer months and form my experience customers / guests do not always hide away at 12 noon. Perhaps they should but they do notDependent on what the rules are it is up to people if they wear masks or not but personally I think people should do all they can to protect others and themselves

Making beer in the Florida heat is a bi* tch too LOL. With or without the mask.I say drink the water here and there and drink the pale ale instead of the double IPA:)

">>>Try wearing a mask in 80 degrees, Answer is you can not , you'll die from heatstroke in a short time.... With Floridas humidity and 90 plus temps, you'll die in 5 minutes, Plus they blow off your face in only 10 mph wind. There will be no masks people on a amusement park ride. They just plain and simple won't work unless glued on with Gorilla glue.<<<Where are all the smiley faces so we know you joking and this is parody?There are all kinds of contractors who work in masks, outdoors, all day long in South FL, in Alabama, LA, etc where it is hot, humid and windy and yet some how all survive."
"J&D don’t joke, they just post so they can accumulate points and get more helpful votes from their faithful followers. Unfortunately a lot of Dean’s posts are just nonsense."
"I like the look of these gaiters, I'd wear one over a regular surgical mask any day. I hope Disney make some of these.And to all the people saying you will die wearing a mask in Florida, there are many Asian Countries where it gets just as hot and humid and they wear them all day and night and even on Coasters and survive just fine.Just because you aren't used to something doesn't make it wrong.I'm thankful though that in Australia our cases are almost non-existant so we haven't had to worry about mask wearing at all. But if they do open the borders and let us out of Australia and into the USA and we are required to wear them, we will and won't complain."
