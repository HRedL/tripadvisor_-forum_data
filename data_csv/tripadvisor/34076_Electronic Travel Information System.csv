"I was just reading through the tahititourisme.com/ and the etis.pf sites.So we have to fill out the ETIS form as soon as we have our negative Covid test back. This is what the ETIS site says:WHAT ARE THE STEPS TO FOLLOW?- Perform an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 within 3 days before boarding and be declared negative- Transmit the test results to the airline serving French Polynesia- Completely complete the online health commitment form on the website www.etis.pf- Accept current health conditionsWHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE THIS REQUEST?Negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test resultsA travel itineraryA valid e-mail address to which your ETIS receipt will be sentA traveler contact point in case of emergency, telephone and emailTravel insurance for anyone not having French nationality. If the insurance does not cover the costs in the event of a pandemic, agree to assume the health costs incurred in French Polynesia including in the event of infection with Covid-19.Can we use our Credit card Travel Insurance for this?"
"Thank you for sharing this Sue. I just saw this update as well. I would call your credit card to make sure their travel insurance covers pandemics, cos many travel insurances do not cover pandemics. We usually get a corporate travel insurance (like Cigna). I called them and they confirmed that they specifically cover all pandemic/COVID 19 related costs.Edited: 8:50 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"Hi Jyotsna, Thank you for this info. I have Cigna Health Insurance through my work. So when you say you usually get Corporate Travel Insurance, what exactly do you mean?Did you just call Cigna for your personal vacation and ask them for travel insurance? Sorry for sounding dumb, LOL."
"No worries at all. I think it depends on the company, mine covers personal travel too. Maybe call Cigna and check ? They should be able to tell you."
"Thanks for posting. Yes, it’s confusing for sure. I was wondering when to fill out the electronic website (I fly on Aug 25th) and how to transmit my COVID results to airline? I booked through delta. Good tip on calling insurance. I have United so I’ll need to give them a call."
"minkathebest - On the ETIS.pf page (Electronic Travel Information System) it says ""Your request must be made no earlier than 3 days before the flight""Looks like we have to have our results from Covid test back before filling out the ETIS form.I am not sure how we get our Covid test results to the airline? I am assuming they do want them in advance so they know how full their aircraft will be. We are flying United and I keep checking to make sure they don't cancel our flights."
