"Hi,Bit of a weird question. Went to LA a couple of weeks ago and went to the above McDonalds and felt very uneasy with the people in there and the people surrounding the area. Was this a bad area we ended up in or was this a one off?Just curious for future referencethanks"
What made you feel uneasy?
"It was quite empty for the time we visited I would expect it to be busier, there was homeless man outside and another man came along shouting to himself and seemed aggressive...did I just happen to come at a weird time or is this area known to be unsafe?"
"You were two blocks from an In-N-Out Burger, there should have been no one in McDonalds at all.While some seedy characters hang out in the Venice/Venice Beach area, I've never considered it in any way dangerous."
"Ever been to the McDonald's at Shattuck and University in Berkeley?As long as customers pay for their $1 coffee, the staff doesn't harass or control unless they are disruptive.Doesn't always have to be homeless to be disruptive or ""disturbing"" to the unfamiliar."
">>>Ever been to the McDonald's at Shattuck and University in Berkeley?<<<Not in 40 years, but +1 anyway :)"
"There are homeless in that area, but there are also multi million dollar homes in that area. That stretch of Lincoln is undergoing a big change, with boutiques and coffee houses opening. Used to be all auto mechanic businesses, but that's changing."
"That's Venice, seedy and uncomfortable. I was in the Ralph's in Venice recently and a homeless guy dropped from the ceiling and ran out the back. He was living in the store for weeks, the workers couldn't figure out who was leaving food scraps behind. We all rolled our eyes and said ""well, that's Venice rather than express surprise."
The problem with homeless and mentally ill is an epidemic issue and is getting worse day by day. Donâ€™t worry about the zombie apocalypse this is much more scary to deal with.
Who mentioned anything about mentally ill people?
I think when the OP mentioned guy shouting to himself and being aggressive.
"Shouting and yelling at nobody is a clear indicator of mental illness, buddy.I don't know if you venture out of your sterile environment in Thousand Oaks, but mental illness is a huge problem in Venice and LA in general."
If you hang around my family enough you'll see plenty of mental illnessCome to think of it... I yell and shout all the time. Sheesh...now I know
Don't come to downtown San Francisco.
"Thanks guys was just curious to know what the area was like being a visitor I didn't know if I was over reacting, really enjoyed my trip to LA and will definitely be back :)"
"A few weeks ago I was walking down the street in Buena Park shouting to myself. I had just ran for a Metro bus, caught up to it, reached the door, and the driver took off leaving me there. Let go with some choice words too! (That driver was going to make me miss a connection that I needed to get home.) There was so much traffic I doubt anyone heard me. I calmed down after a block and a half and got myself a Lyft. (Still bugs that I paid $15 instead of 75 cents.)You never know what someone might be going through.Edited: 1 year ago "
