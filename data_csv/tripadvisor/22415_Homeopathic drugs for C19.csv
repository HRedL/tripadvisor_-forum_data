"the drug called PrevengHo-vir doctors in Cuba started admitting drops to people in Santa Clear mostly to the old generation this drug is for its for viral infections like influenza and other diseases, it's not a cure for the C19 virus, the link is in Granma.Edited: 9:21 pm, April 06, 2020 "
"It's not a drug, it's an homeopathic remedy. Cuba will start giving it to those at risk. They say it boots the immune system. I say that, like any homeopathic remedies, it has the same success as a placebo..."
Where can you buy it?
Homeopathic so called medicine is a scam. It contains pure water. They are charlatans taking an advantage on uneducated people with low IQ. Beware of them. The universities exist not by coincidence but because of hundred years of proven progress of science. Don't let these homeopathetic charlatans scam you out of your money only because they are more clever than you.
You can't. It will be administered by the family doctor or nurse.
"Cuban doctors have good reputation, I can't believe they would administer pure water as so called homeopathic medicine."
"And yet, they do. They also told a friend of our who has been operated to drink a small shot of red wine every day to help the healing process.And they routinely prescribe all kinds of vitamines for any kind of condition. Even when they are not related to a vitamine deficiency. I think (I hope) that it's because they know of the power of the placebo effect."
"It's strange really...you have all these brilliant doctors in Cuba as seen on TV lately, and then you have these quacks...I do agree with the red wine one mind you :)"
"Homeopathic remedies are scams, Read about how these remedies are made. they are nothing but water.It based on a theory that the more you dilute something the more effective it is and only the memory remains."
#2. It's easy take a glass and pour water into it and drink it. That's what's homeopathic remedies are made of. .https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy
Homeopathic works on alcoholics only. If they replace booze with water they are clean. Placebo works only on people who don't know it is not a medication. And even with that it works very rarely.
"Placebo works even on those who know they are receiving a placebo. To summarize (and I'm not expert so I might over vulgarize it too) is that the body is so used to obtain x result when taking a pill/receiving a shot that the brain sends out the chemical to get the effect even without getting any meds.In some countries, they are allowed to prescribe placebo and tell the patient and it works. Pharmaceutical companies use the placebo effect all the time. For example, red pills are more effective on pain then blue pills. I works with surgery too. They did knee surgery on x number of patients. Half of them received the real surgery. The other half got the same scares (they cut the skin at the same place) but nothing else was done. The success rate was the same.Placebo works on pain, inflammation, stress related issues, depression, anything that has to do with your brain sending out chemicals. But of course, it does not work on cancer and the like.I'm thinking that the placebo effect in the Cuban product is that is decrease the stress in the patient. And stress tend to decrease to immune system. The brain is a powerful tool. I'm fascinated with it."
"Sure placebo works, especially on people who think that placebo is some type of antibiotic."
"I don't accept that Cuba's medical experts actually believe in homeopathy. They know it's a placebo and are using it as such.Excellent post above Gengen.Edited: 10:40 am, April 07, 2020 "
RE: Alcoholics. Maybe staying 3/4 lit all the time wards it off. Someone should be tracking .... ;-)
"""The brain is a powerful tool""Absolutely! And I agree, fascinating. Take mirror box therapy for example. For those who haven't heard of it, read here: https://www.physio-pedia.com/Mirror_Therapy"

"<< ""Someone should be tracking .... ;-) "" >>My wife, our adult kids, and I have been gather data on a small-scale observational study since our Governor declared ""Stay At Home"" a few weeks ago.So far, rum, vodka, hard seltzer, beer, and various hard ciders have proven effective at keeping the virus at bay.:-)"
"The brain is okay...depends on the room in there and what you do with the space man...you can organize things, remember things, forget things, learn things, share things, and respond to things, like I'm trying to do right now :) Brains/keyboards aren't that different really...thinking and typing can be challenging especially now with the isolating and drugs at home...I think we're all kind of homeopathic right now :)"
"my opinion I believe in herd immunity this virus attacks your respiratory system you can't breathe basically you drown and if your immune system is weak you can't fight antibiotics meds will cure you most of the time only if you catch this virus quickly, the thing is many people will die depending on there personal health situation if they catch it and pull out your good to go mostly older generation is at higher risk to the virus iv had the same system last year, I'm not saying that I had C19 I was not tested but if you pull out then your immune to this virus.Edited: 5:57 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"It's not a question of 'believing' in herd immunity. It's a demonstrable fact. The real question is whether or not we, as a society are willing to accept the very real and serious effects of just moving ahead with life as usual and allowing nature to take it's course."
"I've read somewhere that herd immunity happens when 60% of the population have been infected. Considering that the death rate is around 4% in Canada, with a population of 37M, it would mean almost 900 000 deaths. And not only ""old sick"" people. A 44 years old doctor from Quebec died yesterday. Do we really want to lose all those lives?And HC, antibiotics are to treat bacteria. The Covid is a virus. Antibiotics are of no use. It needs an antiviral, and those are really specific to certain viruses. Not like lège spectrum antibiotics."
"In fact, Gen, the level at which herd immunity takes effect varies, depending on the virus. I think I read that the number is 90% for measles, for example. Since this virus is still quite unknown to the medical community, they don't know. 60% might be a best-case number.Which makes your point even stronger."
"Thanks for the data CJ! If 60% is the best case scenario... I hope everyone will stay home.But it seems that what many government will try is to gradually remove isolation mesures so no everyone get sick at the same time. Quebec's PM said they could start school May 4th, with some adjustment to include social distancing (with kids... yeah...) .. The best theory that I read behind that surprising decision is that kids will get sick gradually, the highest numbers being reach by the end of the school year, they will have the summer to get better (and their sick parents too) and then you can have a semi normal school year starting September. I have to say that I'm not found of the approach, but it's better then what Trump is suggesting."
"Sweden has been trying that approach. The jury is still out but it doesn't look promising.There are varying approaches being applied in different States. We will see how that works out.Edited: 6:56 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"Gen, I think that your statistics might be off a bit. I think that the 4% mortality rate in Canada is based on the number of people who contract Covid-19, not on the total population. It’s a shell game to determine actual numbers in Canada, as health is administered provincially. That said, this is a good time to bring up what we refer to in Nova Scotia as “Personal Directives"". It might be called something different in other provinces. (My apologies to members from outside Canada, but I’m not sure what coverage you may have.)Without being maudlin, I invite people to check out this article and the links in it. https:/…new-online-app-living-wills-1.5513631Have you discussed your own “personal directives"" with your family/friends? If you are hospitalized with Covid-19 (let’s hope not!) are your values/wishes going to be respected? What happens to each of us is a very personal choice – what is right for one might not be right for another. For example, I have chosen a close friend instead of a family member to be my “alternate decision maker"". As much as I love my family members, they wouldn’t ba able to respect my wishes … based on their values they’d be lighting candles at the alter instead of pulling the proverbial plug!

"Mad, Yes, 4% is the rate of death compared to how many people are infected. So 4 deaths in every 100 infected. Then I based my math on a rate of infection of 60% of the population of Canada, which is 22 200 000 and applied 4% to that, to arrive at almost 900 000 deaths. But it's true that it does not take into account the fact that some people might have been infected without being tested, so the death rate in Canada could be lower. Right now, we have a death rate of 32 person for 1M population. But if we all get back to a ""normal"" life, it will be higher. How high, no one knows."

"@26, ""Pneumonia"" is not one disease with only one cause. There's pneumonia caused by pneumococcus (bacteria). This can be treated with antibiotics. There are also a couple of different vaccines for this.But there's also pneumonia from other causes, notably viruses. Antibiotics are useless as a treatment for this. So when you hear about people with covid-19 getting pneumonia, that doesn't mean they have something that can be treated with antibiotics. Disclaimer: not a medical professional."
"From the number of recent posts, I think some of us have gained an hour each day.Zinc and Vit C are what work for me to stop a cold."
"AG I know, basically your immune system fights off the virus I think if your strong and if you catch it right away in time, I don't think people die of the virus they die say of bad respiratory low immune system and other health issues complications, I said pneumonia could be treated with meds with antibiotics in my first post.I'm not a health expert, just saying.Edited: 9:17 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"@ 30, the thing is the death rate is not a fixed rate. It can be influenced. It depends on a bunch of different variables but the one that should be of most interest to us is healthcare system capacity. We know that no matter what we do, some large portion of the population will eventually get the virus. How many will die? That depends on what we do.if we do nothing, the number of infections explodes in a short time, the healthcare system gets overloaded, and you wind up with a massive death rate because some people can't get any treatment at all. This also means the system has trouble coping with things other than covid, and even more people die.If we use lockdowns, quarantines, etc. to deliberately prolong the pandemic, we keep the number of simultaneous sick people down, and hopefully prevent a healthcare system overload. The result should be a lower fatality rate. As we've seen in places like NYC, Spain and others, it doesn't even take a very large percentage of the population getting sick for healthcare to get overloaded. I can't imagine the horrors if these places had done *nothing*. tl;dr there's no point in taking a single round number like 4% as ""the"" death rate."
""" I said pneumonia could be treated with meds with antibiotics in my first post.""Yes, and when you said that you seemed to be confusing bacterial and viral pneumonia. When somebody with covid develops viral pneumonia and dies, they have been killed by the virus. It doesn't make sense to see it any other way. In my also non-professional opinion."
"at one time pneumonia was know as a old man's friend and still to this day, sorry to say, at times can still be a old man's friend."
"@39 The point of taking the actual death rate of 4% (which is probably the best case scenario if we lose all security mesures) was to show what could be a potential consequence of doing what Trump's suggesting, and what many people want so that the economy does not crash further down, which is to get back to an almost regular life. No more then that. And HC, if you want to get technical, the only cause of death is heart failure (when the heart stops...)"

"In Quebec, last year, with my retirement underway I had three documents drawn up by a notary,.Last Will and Testament: you all know what that is.Advance Medical Directives: If I reach a state where I cannot make decisions about my health, Doctors will not use any medical techniques to keep me alive as specified by me in the document or something to that effect. No life support if my end is inevitable. Protective Mandate in Case of Incapacity: Which basically says, as to my wishes expressed to the notary, the day that I cannot function on my own in my own home, I want assisted suicide. Now that I've seen what is happening at these senior residences with Covid 19, who can argue with my decision. Senior homes look like prisons, or at least the ones that they would stick me into. Who wants to spend their last days in a dirty diaper eating pureed slop. And if no one wants to to do, I'll do it myself.Theses are choices that you have to make, don't leave it up to others to have to decide for you. That's a heavy burden to place on people. You may also divide a family and friends as they have to argue among themselves over what is best for you if you have not made it clear in writing."

"Given the very high rate of success of Homoeopathic placebo's 50 time higher than orthodox placebo's...That's quite a claim! Can you back it up?....then why doesn't the medical profession employ homoeopathic placebo's in the same manner as homoeopaths do, and get all the success and praise Homoeopaths get ???Ethics, for starters."
Homeopathic placebos are no better than regular placebos. Its all nonsense. There has never been a study about homeopathic remedies that has validated its usefulness. Except those that were done by quacks and could not be replicated by real science methodology. .You are spreading lies and misinformation and having nothing to back up your claims.PS you are not permitted to self promote on this website. so so much for integrity.
"You are absolutely right. Homeopathic is a big time scam based on uneducated cretins. Unfortunately they, being cretins, can't understand how science works. I think that homeopathic must be legally prohibited in all civilized countries. Something like for example gun's silencers or hard drugs."
"Homeopathy is all superstitious mumbo-jumbo.A homeopathic remedy is nothing more than a dose of water.The placebo effect may work, but whether it is a dose of water that the patient thinks will work, or a sugar pill that the patient thinks will work, there is no difference."
"I know several people who swear by homeopathic medicine. I was really curious why they do believe in its effectiveness, as I do not at all. After spending some time talking to them, I think I kind of figured out why they were such strong proponents of homeopathy:• Homeopathic doctors spend a lot of time with them, listen to them and show a genuine interest in their ailments—something that regular doctors, regrettably, rarely do.• In addition to giving them homeopathic remedies, they also encourage them to change their lifestyle—be more active and exercise, quit smoking/drinking, lose weight, eat healthy food, etc.Thus, it was both the placebo effect and the actual change in their way of life that contributed to improvements in their health, real or perceived, rather than any homeopathic dilutions they were given.Last, but not least, I still remember a story told by a medical student (or a newly minted doctor-I don’t remember), who was supposed to examine a patient. Because of some mix-up, he got the wrong patient, with medical problems beyond the scope of his training. However, he decided to proceed by asking the patient a lot of questions and then meticulously examining him, even though he had no idea how to really do it properly. To make the story short—the patient contacted the hospital to personally thank this ‘outstanding, superb young doctor’ who did such an excellent job."
"We used to call it bedside manner. I think we lost it for a generation but it's importance seems to be recognized once again. Still, it doesn't justify using magic pills just because the practitioner has a good bedside manner."
"Homeopathic drugs just ain't what they used to be. Back in their day, they made you feel good even if they did not cure anything. Now there is no more cocaine in Coca Cola as there was in the original formula and all those high proof alcohol based medicines such as Hadacol no longer exist as cure-all's."
A good mustard poultice on the throat would surely clear out a bad case of covid19 I betcha....
They're not homeopaths. THey are vaccine scientists from the Finlay institute in Cuba. Also they are not 'scamming' money from anyone. The homeopathy is given out freely.
"The thing is, even prescribed medications are often no better than placebo. So it's not just homeopathic medications that are suspect. The mind is an interesting thing.

"Modern medicine and drugs have helped increase life expectancy by more than 20 years over the last century. I'll take whatever it has to offer, thank you very much."
"If not for modern medicine, I would have died three years ago. The meds I take now are allowing me to live longer.Homeopathic drugs are the products for snake oil salesman to peddle. Yes the mind is powerful and also gullible, sometimes ready to believe anything out of desperation. Maybe it's to our disadvantage to become informed about these matters as it makes us less susceptible to quack cures."
"I'm not dissing modern medicine, just pointing out that some specific drugs really do not do what they are supposedly designed to do. Also, many over the counter drugs are misused and overused. Not to mention the horrible overuse of antibiotics, which increasingly is running us out of options for resistant infections. The Covid thing has everyone's attention at the moment, but we really need to pay attention to our increasing vulnerability to common bacterial infections. Drug companies don't spend a lot of time researching new antibiotics, because they don't see the money in it, but we risk being unable to safely perform what have become routine surgeries if we don't develop antibiotics that can handle the increasingly resistant bacterial strains."

"Homeopathic means that it literally IS water, or if prepared in pill form, sugar.The dilution is so extreme that the original compound is undetectable in the final product.

"We received our bottle this morning. I have read the label, and all ingredients are in a proportion of 200ck. I looked online to know what CK was. And got the confirmation that we had received a nice bottle of water and ethanol at 30% (they don't specify the quantity on the label, but states that it does contain ethanol 30%). Here is the definition given by Boiron, one of the leaders in homeopathic remedies:What does “200CK” mean?200CK means that the substance has been homeopathically diluted 200 times at the rate of 1 to 100.What does the “K” listed after the active ingredient stand for?The K refers to a method of manufacturing known as the Korsakovian method. The Korsakovian method dilutes the homeopathic preparation of the substance at the rate of 1 part of the previous dilution with 99 parts of solvent.What does the “CK” listed after the active ingredient stand for?Korsakovian dilutions are manufactured using a device specially designed to ensure that the dilution process is reproducible from one dilution to the next. Only one vial is used for the entire process. Using ultra-purified water as the solvent, the machine removes 99% of the Mother Tincture and replaces it with the same volume of solvent. The vial is succussed for 10.5 seconds. The result is called 1CK. The 2CK is prepared identically from the 1CK. The automatic process using only 1 vial allows higher dilutions to be reached. The most common Korsakovian dilutions are 200CK, 1,000CK (also called 1M), 10,000CK (10M), 50,000 CK (50M) and 100,000CK (100M or CM).https://www.boironusa.com/info/"
"Just for fun, I once did the calculation, and if I remember correctly, when you have a 200CK solution, it would only be by the slightest chance that you would have one molecule of the so-called ""active ingredient"" in something like a liter of the solution.Also, that water-ethanol solution probably more closely resembles weak vodka. It likely doesn't have all the flavourings it needs to make a decent drink with Tukola."

"A homeopathic remedy is just as likely to have the ""memory"" of rat poison and feces as it does whatever they say is in there. For those who say that it works as a placebo. Well if you know that you are getting a placebo, what good is it."
"Well sssnakes, the good news is that many people are convinced by the kind of sciency language Gen quoted in no. 72. It sounds so expertish! So seriousesque! It can't possibly be pseudoscientific nonsense! And then some governments give it legitimacy, whether by largely ignoring it because it does nothing (Canada's approach AFAIK), covering it with public insurance (not sure if this is still going on but I believe the UK and France do or did this), or by distributing it, like they're doing in Cuba. There's no guarantee that believers in woo-woo won't find their way into positions of power. But wait, there's more! There are also a lot of people who think homeopathic and naturopathic mean the same thing. But the latter is not diluted to oblivion. It's more like herbal remedies, with ingredients in measurable concentrations. I'm not a big believer in the value of it, but there is at least the real possibility of active ingredients that could actually have the advertised effect. (I'd happily take some willow bark extract if there were no aspirin to be had.) And that's what a lot of people think homeopathic means. So, many people will not know it's a placebo, they'll think it's a real pharmaceutical product or an herbal remedy. I just hope they don't start thinking it makes them immune so they can stop taking sanitary precautions."
"Jack, there are 1670000000000000000000 (that's 1.67 X 10-23rd) molecules in one drop of water. A drop diluted by a million liters still has millions of molecules of the original per liter.Many flavoured vodkas in North America are 30% alcohol.Edited: 8:01 am, May 21, 2020 "
"I'm going to go with Jack on this one.https:/…Homeopathic_dilutionsAll quotes from here on:""If one begins with a solution of 1 mol/L of a substance, the dilution required to reduce the number of molecules to less than one per litre is 1 part in 1×10^24 (24X or 12C) since:6.02×10^23/1×10^24 = 0.6 molecules per litreHomeopathic dilutions beyond this limit (equivalent to approximately 12C) are unlikely to contain even a single molecule of the original substance and lower dilutions contain no detectable amount. ISO 3696 (Water for analytical laboratory use) specifies a purity of ten parts per billion, or 10×10^-9 ― this water cannot be kept in glass or plastic containers as they leach impurities into the water, and glassware must be washed with hydrofluoric acid before use. Ten parts per billion is equivalent to a homeopathic dilution of 4C....A popular homeopathic treatment for the flu is a 200C dilution of duck liver, marketed under the name Oscillococcinum. As there are only about 10^80 atoms in the entire observable universe, a dilution of one molecule in the observable universe would be about 40C. Oscillococcinum would thus require 10^320 times more atoms to simply have one molecule in the final substance.[12]"""

If medicines are in short supply or not available (as might be the case in Cuba) Then I guess a placebo is better than nothing.I really have a hate on for that company and its snake oil claims. I'm surprised Trump hasn't recommended any of that.Edited: 10:00 am, May 21, 2020 "
"I agree iTunes most of what you say. But I also think that placebo should be used in case of over used of medication like pain killers. Placebo does not have counter effects, as most of the other meds do. So if it works, why not give it? As for the Cubans drops, they are designed and manufactured in Cuba, so the government is paying itself... I still think it's a waist of money, but at least it's not some big company making profits."
"It's been a month since Sweden was held up in this thread as bravely forging a path to herd immunity, which some claimed should have been achieved by now.How's that working out?Even in Sweden a lot of scientists think the approach is a disaster:https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-coron…Antibody study: 7.3% total infection rate in Stockholm at the end of April:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/2…Soft lockdown didn't save the economy:https://nationalpost.com/news/world/sweden-i…So, nowhere near herd immunity, well on the way toward having the highest per capita covid death toll in the world, economic crisis happening anyway.Almost makes me feel better about the disaster here at home in Quebec."
"Gengen: I totally agree with you on the benefits of placebos in creating patient satisfaction. There is much scientific evidence of this, even when the patient knew in advance they were going to be getting a placebo. It it causes patient satisfaction, why not?Others should note that Cuban medical treatment is much broader than we typically experience at home. Much official acceptance and use of medicine and procedures than are not so at home. Last year while staying in my regular casa in Holguin city, the 4 year old son developed a severe stomach ache. His father, a cardiologist, took him to a ""traditional medicine"" doctor who gave him a massage. Stomach ache got much better. I asked the cardiologist father about his choice of a ""traditional medicine"" (i.e. non-traditional to us) doctor. He replied that was what we Americans call ""results oriented"" decision making."
"Interesting.....worldwide use of homeopathyhttps:/…Under the heading you can fool some of the people all of the time?? But then, Trump got elected in the States, so believing in homeopathy isn't so far fetched! ;-)"
"Spunky, your number of 1670000000000000000000 seems to be short a couple of zeros. That is actually 1.67 x 10 to the 21st power.But if you actually mean 1.67 x 10 to the 23rd, that is more than a drop. If we are dealing with water, that many molecules would be about 5 grams, which is a volume of about 5 mililiters, which is about 80 drops.Back to the homeopathic dilution: 200C means that the substance has been diluted 200 times at a ratio of 1 in 100. So for the first step, 1 ml of the substance is mixed with 100 ml of water.In the nest step, 1ml of that solution is mixed with 100 ml of water.So, 1C is dilution to 1 in 100. 2C is dilution to 1 in 100,000, and 3C is dilution to 1 in 1,000,000.By the time you dilute to 13C, the average number of molecules of the original substance in any liter of solution is already less than 1.I only took the original calculation to 30C, but by the time you get there, you have diluted to one part in 10 to the 60th power. Or in other words, you would still be unlikely to find any more than one molecule in 6.68 x 10 to the 22nd power cubic kilometres of the final solution."

"Also, note that 6.68 x 10 to the 22nd cubic kilometres is about 50 trillion times the volume of the earth's oceans, just to give some perspective. In a 200C dilution, if you found a molecule of the original substance in a liter of solution, it would only be by accident, or due to contamination.But the good news is that a homeopathic remedy is quite unlikely to do any harm. Unless you have a really large volume of it, and you drown in it."
"I don't expect homeopathic remedies do anything beyond act as a potent placebo for those who believe in them, but I have learned to never say ""never"". Lots of things that seemed inexplicable and outrageous at the time they were first postulated became accepted when the science caught up, and lots of things that have profound effects are extremely small, e.g. prion proteins. The thing is, we don't know what we don't know, and while I would be surprised if a double blind study ever came up with evidence of homeopathic remedies having an effect, I wouldn't dismiss it if it happened, either. Lots of folks believe in God, for which there is less evidence than homeopathic remedies working ""in mysterious ways"". ;-)"
"Eeefarm, i keep an open mind as well about many things. But not homeopathy. There have been indépendant blind studies about homeopathy, and the success rate is the same as the placebo effect.I don't have the link to the studies, but ""Le Pharmacien"", a Québec pharmacist who has a blog and a tv show to demystify science and try to see if there are scientific proofs of some popular belief in health care (like homeopathy, or the ""acidification"" of the diet, or the effect of fasting) did a great review of the studies related to homeopathic remedies. It's a great watch for those who understand French."

"@100, very unlikely to achieve anything like herd immunity without a vaccine. Maybe in a small, isolated population, but not with international travel. You would have to have twice as many people infected than in the 1918 flu to get anywhere close. And the death toll would be extremely high...."
Mike - but more important that confirmed cases would be to see the distribution of critical cases and deaths by age.btw - you were surprised that Cuba mentioned about 10% of confirmed cases were children. I not that Canada has 5.5% 19 or under - and suspect that Cuba has tested more children with their contact tracing approach.
"@103, absolutely! I am sure we are missing a lot of kids, because if they are not severely ill we aren't testing them. You don't find what you are not looking for...."
"The lower percentage of children infected in Canada may also have to see with demographics and way of life. Houses tend to be bigger in Canada but the number of people under the same roof is less (i.e extended family households). Elderly people, save exception have their own place and many live in facilities dedicated to the elderly, for autonomous people or not and a lot of cases have been in long term care homes."
"I have no idea if it is a high number or not without comparing to demographics.The general reports are that most children who do get the virus are without symptoms or only have mild cases - but that does not mean that children don’t get the virus.Edited: 1:03 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"I don't think so, Mike. It's just that there are lots of reasons why children may be poorly represented in the statistics. And, for that matter, there are reasons other than age why elderly may seem to be more prone to infection. Living conditions is a big one. Like the dorms in Singapore with huge numbers of infected foreign workers, or the meat packing plants, or places of religious gatherings, anywhere with many people crowded together will likely yield high levels of infection. Which is why suspending school classes was a good idea."
"Being infected is one thing, dying from it is something else, and in that respect the older you are the more likely you are to die if infected. At least, that is what the statistics are showing. I think it is an ""equal opportunity"" disease in terms of catching it (testing doesn't tell the complete picture of who has been infected), but your chances of survival are worse the older you are. Mind you, we are seeing some interesting developments in younger people and there is a lot we don't know about the possible long term effects."

"@112, Thanks for the information. I had a look at the study and several evaluations of it, and on the surface it does appear to have had the desired effect, although the study is limited because of the setting and not being double blind. Given the evidence it's easy to draw the conclusion that the treatment was effective, and particularly because the population that went untreated and therefore served as a control group did not have as good outcomes. That suggests that it was the homeopathic treatment and not some coincidental circumstance."
"I remain skeptical. Homeopathic remedies are nothing but water, so they can't possibly be effective, other than a placebo effect."
"<< ""That suggests that it was the homeopathic treatment and not some coincidental circumstance."" >>Once you realize that a trial is not properly designed (ie not randomized and blinded) you can't really take ANY suggestion from the results... there's no way to evaluate the results.It's a ""GIGO"" situation.If the homeopathic people are so smart -- and actaully believe in what they're doing -- why don't they ever seem to properly design their studies? That would head off any arguments.Edited: 5:34 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"I agree with what RJP wrote. I would also add that I did not find anything suggesting that others, in other circumstances, had the same outcome.

Also, eeeefarm: ""particularly because the population that went untreated and therefore served as a control group did not have as good outcomes. That suggests that it was the homeopathic treatment and not some coincidental circumstance.""Well, not necessarily. Those who did not receive the ""remedy"" might have been in different circumstances, either financial, psychological, physical, etc.For example, many studies seemed to show a link between breastfeeding in Occidental societies and healthier, more intelligent and developed children. However, they realized that, in our society, a woman who's educated, has money, etc is more likely to breastfeed. So what they thought was linked to breastfeeding was rather linked to the social-economic conditions that the kids were raised in..."
"We are still left with the question of ""how does it work?"" Correlation does not prove causation. What we have is a late 18th century physician (they had some absurd ideas back then) who posited an idea. That idea has still not been scientifically proven over 200 years later. In fact science has pretty much debunked the science behind it. If Samuel Hahnemann's ideas are correct it would be one of the most important discoveries not just in medical science but also in physics. It is far more likely that there is a placebo effect involved (something that we do understand) but that doesn't mean that homeopathy has any merit whatsoever. In the absence of real medical care I suppose that giving a placebo is better than nothing and we understand that in many cases it just might work, but that still does not mean that homeopathic treatments have any scientific validity. I studied Statistics and we all know the common phrase about statistics.Edited: 6:12 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"Is the answer as simple as those not believing in homeopathic remedies not using them while allowing those who do believe to use them? There is no evidence they cause no harm. And in Cuba, the cost if any, if minimal. I simply cannot see any reason for everyone's concern."

"What's interesting is the study and the information around it. ""Within 2 weeks of administering the homeopathic product, they observed a 90% decrease in incidence of leptospirosis in the intervention region (comprising 2.1 million persons), while in the low-risk areas which did not receive any intervention (either homeopathic or conventional) incidence of the disease continued to rise""I like to have a look at things before I write them off as fiction.

We do vaccinate canines and equines with varying results. Like Dengue, Lepto has several variants, which makes it hard to target the particular strain and we do not have vaccines available that cover all strains. With Dengue this can result in a worse outcome for someone who has been vaccinated than if they had not if they encounter a strain that does not match the vaccine."
"Also interesting....University of Toronto is currently conducting ""A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study of Homeopathic Treatment of Children and Youth With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" Results due out in June, 2020. Stay tuned! ;-)"
"You simply can’t give a treatment in one geographic region and not in another (especially if the risk levels are high in one area and low in another) and draw ANY conclusion whatsoever.I’m not saying the results are “fiction” but rather I’m saying “it’s impossible to tell one way or the other.”There’s easily half a hundred confounding factors that could be at work.And the publication wherein one group of homeopathic practitioners re-evaluated the data and said “we checked it out... and it was true” is laughable. You can’t do a post-hoc analysis of a poorly designed, non-randomized, non-controlled study and draw any conclusions. (Other than concluding that the original study was poorly designed.)"
"<< “ University of Toronto is currently conducting ""A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study...” >>I’ve actually worked in the ADHD space and know the group in Toronto. That’s surely a well-designed study."
"The idea that homeopathic remedies and other pseudoscience does no harm is misguided and potentially dangerous. If a person forgoes sound medical advice and instead buys into nonsense and chooses to take magical water pills, very real and unavoidable harm can result. Now if sound medical practices are unobtainable, as may be the case in some countries in some instances, I suppose there is no harm in dispensing homeopathic remedies. But it is certainly not ideal and we should be working to provide proven medical care to those people."
"There is no possible basis for thinking that homeopathy could work. As I have said many times, the homeopathic ""remedy"" can not possibly be anything more than water. (Or in some cases, it may be an alcohol-water mixture, in which case the active ingredient is actually the alcohol.)The whole basis for believing in homeopathy is like believing in magic. And magic simply does not exist. There is no point in reading up on any homeopathy studies, because if they say it worked, they are flawed studies."
"RJP-NJ, borracho, Cuba Jack: I still think we should defer those decisions to the Cuban medical system rather than telling them that they should do things our way since we know better."

As mentioned further above, there’s a reason that the homeopathic people tend to do exquisitely poorly designed trials. It’s not like information about how to do them correctly is some sort of closely guarded secret that they’re unable to access. They purposely CHOOSE to do trials that are designed in a way that defies critical evaluation.You just need to ask yourself why this is the case.Edited: 12:00 am, June 18, 2020 "
"I've been enjoying the posts on this thread. People are so positive about their opinions. I absolutely agree that there does not appear to be a scientific explanation for homeopathy other than placebo effect, and perhaps it is all BS, but in history there have always been things we didn't understand (until we did) and people who were just as positive that they were right, so my own personal view is ""never say never"" because I don't know it all. As far as understanding how something can't possibly work or be true, try wrapping your head around quantum mechanics! What is interesting to me is how many people and even health care systems use homeopathy despite it being discounted by science. But then, many people think prayer works, and probably more people believe in God than in homeopathy, with less evidence. So there you are. Humans are gullible, or humans don't know everything, take your pick. (yes, I enjoy playing ""devil's advocate"")"

"It's easy to come up with a numbering system where 2+2=5. The most trivial form would be one where the count goes 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 ...As for my comments on homeopathy, they are not opinions. They are facts. I looked up how the homeopaths calculate their dilution, and did the numbers myself. (Really, other than an understanding of scientific notation, the only other math you need to understand is nothing more than grade 5 arithmetic.)The result was that the probability of finding any more than one molecule in a liter of solution is essentially zero once you get to a 30C dilution. In fact, it is negligible even at a dilution level of 13C.And even if you did get that one molecule (or bacterium, in the most recent case we are discussing), it would do neither any harm, nor good.The only benefit to homeopathy is the placebo effect.Regardless of how you do your studies, science is the same in Cuba as it is anywhere else.

"eeeefarm, the cool thing about that movie is that it does involve time travel far into the future. And the super cool thing about that too is that when H.G. Wells wrote his book... The Time Machine... that was in 1895, well before the first and second world wars, of which he predicted in his book, and are also highlighted in that movie too.Terry"
"Yes, but the problematic thing about it is that it's extremely unlikely one would be able to return to one's own time after a trip to the future. (Even The Doctor messes up from time to time, like bringing Rose back 12 months instead of 12 hours after their departure, and he is a Time Lord, after all!)"
"For homeopathy to be credible one would have to accept that water has ""memory"". This is why I said earlier that if that can be proven it would be among the amazing scientific discoveries of all time. It would lead to an entirely new branch of scientific research. It it possible?; sure, anything is possible. Is it plausible:; no, not based on what we currently know. I prefer to live my life in the world as we understand it but as a curious person it is interesting to speculate about what what may be possible. This is what drives science. But when it comes to my health I'll stick to what has been proven. To me homeopathy will remain in the junk drawer until it can be demonstrated as true."
"<< “ So many time travel movies involve going into the past, quite unlikely to be possible.” >>Laws of physics take it beyond “quite unlikely” to “absolutely impossible.” Conservation of Matter and that pesky Second Law Of Thermodynamics.:-)Into the future?

"I'm a huge fan of early science fiction (still am) and I read a ton of it especially when I was younger. HG Wells, Bradbury, Asimov, and so many more. It's interesting to read those books going back to the 40s as see how much they got right (and wrong too). Back then one could speculate about what was on the moon or mars because we hadn't been there yet."
"I expect the main difficulty with time travel, either forward, or backward would be the enormous amount of energy that would be required to warp space-time sufficiently to achieve it. Perhaps, in the time of the 31st century, when Futurama is set, we may find a way to harness energy sources that will be enough. That is, if we survive long enough. Or maybe it will be something that is done by our descendants some time after they evolve into something more advanced than we (arrogantly named) homo sapiens. Or perhaps the intelligent descendants of cockroaches or wasps."
"RPJ, yes you are correct that the second law pretty much forbids reversal of time in any way, including time travel back in time."
"I have no problem accepting that something works even if we don't understand how it works. For example, there were proof of the placebo effect before they could understand how it works. Same thing for the impact of emotions on some health condition. Years ago, ""alternate"" medicine stated that being angry could led to gastro intestinal problems. It seemed like quite ""new age/mystical"" thing to say. But there were proof of it. Now, they understand that anger make the bain tell the body to produce (I think it's cortisol), which we now discovered is an inflammatory agent to the gastro intestinal system, more specifically to the colon. So I try to keep an open mind. But for me, the case of homeopathy is been resolved years ago. Because all the indépendant studies that have been conducted and that were following a proper protocol showed that it has no more efficacy then the placebo effect. As for time travel, I would like to travel in the futur right now and bring back the vaccine for Covid, so we can start living and traveling like we did in 2019!!! ;-)"
"<< “ Or maybe it will be something that is done by our descendants some time after they evolve into something more advanced than we” >>As Hawking once opined, the only thing you need to recognize to realize that time travel isn’t possible is that... if it WERE possible it would have happened by now.

You clearly have no understanding of homeopathy. Let me give you some information. Please read:https:/…2156587214525402In 2006 Cuba cured a large number of its citizens who were sick with leptospirosis with homeopathy.
"""Into the future? That requires traveling faster than the speed of light, unfortunately.""No, actually, it doesn't. If you can get anywhere close to the speed of light, time for you will slow down compared to time on earth. So if you journey away from earth at close to the speed of light and then return, time for you will pass slower and you will have aged less than the people who remain on earth. Or so goes the theory, which we are a long way from proving!"
Time is relative... Einstein's theory that has now been proven. So 1 second is not always 1 second. ;)Terry

While your watch will be ever so slightly off... they will not have ""beaten you to the future"" nor will you have ""stayed in the past.""

In fact you rely on it every time you use a GPS device. GPS satellites must actually correct for this very real ""relativistic"" effect.GPS measures distance by triangulating how long it takes a signal to travel between satellites and your GPS receiver.Special Relativity predicts that clocks on board GPS satellites will ""tick"" at a different rate than a clock on earth. Slower by a few microseconds a day. And guess what... they actually do. When ""viewed"" from earth, the clocks on GPS satellites will fall behind a synced reference clock on earth by a few microseconds a day. So the engineers build in a correction to make the satellite clocks tick at the same rate as the reference clocks on earth. If they didn't, the signal from the satellites would be received by your GPS unit a few nanoseconds BEFORE it left the satellite.

"Yup. What I meant was the we have not ""proven the theory"" in terms of having actually done the experiment on ""aging"" by physically doing it as opposed to thought experiments. The clock thing, yes, done a long time ago. And nanoseconds add up eventually. On a space flight close to the speed of light you would spend less time on the trip than those left behind would experience. Depending on speed and duration for example, you might make it back while still young in time to attend your twin brother's 90th birthday. But if we had that speed capacity we could hop over to Mars for afternoon tea in far less time than it takes to fly to Cuba, and wouldn't that be fun?"
"RJP, (sorry, I spelled it wrong earlier) I had forgotten about Stephen Hawking's comment. I had made a similar observation some time more than sixty years ago. When I was approaching my twelfth birthday, I decided that if time travel became practical for an ordinary person, I would travel back in time and visit myself on my twelfth birthday. My birthday came and went, and I had no visitor from the future. So either time travel will not be possible in my lifetime, or by the time it becomes available for the casual traveler, I will be too old and feeble to partake.On the subject of the speed of light, if we travel close enough to the speed of light, we would observe sufficient time-dilation that we would be younger than our previously same-age friends who stayed home. I think that some science-fiction authors speculated that if we could find a way to travel faster than light, it would reverse the passage of time, and would result in travel back in time. Another reason to suspect that time travel backwards is impossible."
"@149, I think it is you who do not understand homeopathy. Sorry to say that, but based on how homeopathy is described by the homeopaths themselves, there is no way that it can be effective other than via the placebo effect. A homeopathic dilution will result in a dose that contains none of the active ingredient, so a sugar pill is likely to be as effective."
