Hi AllI have a 2 week trip to France planned from the end of Aug to Sept inc Paris.I am due to fly out on 27/8 to Bordeaux. I'm expecting the UK gov to reintroduce quarantine rules by then. I am luck as I have a job where we now work from home. My worry is if France introduces reciprocal rules. Have the French gov done this to Norway since they have reintroduced quarantine? All my hotels are refundable. I know the risks but I need a break from my job n need to take my annual leave otherwise I will lose it.Thanks for any help

"Hi Rina - the quarantine rules are quite onerous. Working from home is only part of it because you are not supposed to leave your home for 14 days for any reason, including exercise or buying food or medicine. You can get someone to bring you those things at a distance. Frankly it doesn't look like many quarantined UK returners are being checked on but those are the guidelines. Apologies if you know all that already."
"Quarantine has been for many astonishingly similar to solitary cell internment, it helps if you have a garden.Seriously though, although that was pretty serious, 14 days isolation is actually far less burdensome than the 12 weeks suffered by many of the elderly population that the British Government have been trying to cull.Keep wellAnthony K"
"If the UK begins a quarantine of those arriving from France, I should expect the French to do the same."
SarastroDon't encourage it. Spain hasn't gone that way. Reciprocation is not a given.Keep wellAnthony K
Thanks for all your replies I guess its a waiting game. If France does reciprocate then I will cancel n try my luck with Italy instead. I know UK gov been pretty useless but i will abide by the quarantaine rules. Im from London but live in Oxfordshire so dont socialise much.
"Rina WMaintain your optimism. You will find TA has a number of pessimists who think they are realists.Because the UK Government, for the past few months, have been as useful as a chocolate teapot, that only makes me more determined to get away. Even if it is just for a week and I have to quarantine when I return.C'est la vieAnthony KEdited: 1:46 pm, August 10, 2020 "
Thanks Anthony for your positivity even though I am a realist myself.I have a stressful job n want sometime away. Enjoy your trip as well
"Let me rephrase my post #4. Wherever the UK has instituted a quarantine, France has quickly reciprocated. That is simply a fact."
"SarastroYour ""wherever"" should be a ""whenever.""I feel Boris and Emmanuel may well have several heated telephone calls before any action is taken by either party.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Anthony, I must chuckle. You're really in no place to gratuitously call attention to someone's spelling, especially when misspellings so frequently riddle your own posts."
"edefranIt's not just a misspelt word, it changes the meaning of the sentence.C'est la vieAnthony K"
"Not really. « wherever » has a secondary meaning of 'in every case when', which parses just as well as « whenever ». But as this is unrelated to any kind of confinement measures, the stated purpose of this thread, I'm bowing out. You may choose to believe whatever wherever whenever."

"Oh no the topic gone off the boil stay cool people.Anyway im pretty confident UK will put France on the Q list unless infection rates decrease. I seen already the French infection rates have gone done today but that might be the weekend effect.Im hoping the French will be nice but if not Ill defo plan to go again nxt year. France is a beautiful country n so much to see. However, there is a world pandemic so I will take it as it is. Take care people"
"Rina WAll indications are that France will be added to the UKs ""Quarantine"" list on Wednesday. I am sure that the UK Govt Foreign Office website will be updated by the following morning. If France does not reciprocate then visiting is at your determination, if you can ""Quarantine"" when you come back to the UK.I know that I can cancel and receive a voucher to use against future flights. As for the Hotel, it remains open, and I may have to kiss my payment goodbye.Keep wellAnthony K"
"I think perhaps a more significant concern than quarantine is whether the FCO advice will be changed to advise only essential travel to France - if that happens but you decide to travel anyway, your insurance will almost certainly be invalid, so you must ask yourself if you're happy to travel uninsured?"
"The French government said they would reciprocate any quarantine back in May, however they haven't this time with Norway."
"Boris Johnson, a man who does Prime Minister impersonations, believes that when he makes determinations, of this sort, he is speaking for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The First Ministers of the latter three countries rarely agree with him.In this case if the French were to reciprocate, and put in place ""quarantine"" rules for all those visiting from the UK, then Macron is punishing the Scots, Welsh and Irish who have contained Covid19 far better than has been done in England. Just an idle thoughtAnthony K"
"Well it's not official yet but looks like France wont be put on Quarantine list yet.Mainly due to drama we are having with the French with migrant crisis. Also French are likely due to let's say the complex historic relationship with Britain would introduce reciprocal measures. I have two wks to go for my 19 night trip to southern France n Paris. Fingers crossed :) btw I'm might be proven wrong in a couple of hours lolEdited: 7:29 am, August 13, 2020 "
Simon Calder on radio 10m ago said (his opinion) that France was almost certain to be added to the FCO list / quarantine list following today's figures. He said an announcement will be made this afternoon.
Oh interesting I got mine from a newspaper article saying the decision was on a knife edge. Lets see.
Further large percentage rise announced this morning. Your right in so much as the FCO / quarantine advice would have been changed by now if it wasn't for the tunnel and migrant issues. It's only those issues preventing it but the numbers are going firmly the wrong way. It looks like my early October visit is doomed.
HiSorry to hear that. It's to be expected that people may have to change their travel plans. I'm waiting on gov announcement n might change my plan to Italy which have low c19 rates.
"It is increasingly likely that France is heading into the ""red zone"" for certain other countries in Europe. Stop making plans for travel to France until things become clearer."
"It's already in the red zone for Norway : https:/… (only essential travel between France and Norway advised, and quarantine for everyone arriving in Norway from France). It went into effect last Sunday at 0.00, to the great dismay of the passengers of a Paris-Oslo flight which landed at 0.01"
"SophWith the France - Norway situation, am I right in saying that France has not reciprocated.Keep wellAnthony K"
"No, France has not reciprocated for Norway, but the ties between France and Norway are not as... intricated as those between France and UK, so I would not read too much into it."
"Just keep your fingers crossed, Anthony. Anything is possible at the moment."

"Its official n unsurprising 14 day quarantine for visitors from France.Let's see if France recoipate n then I will make my decision. That's lifeEdited: 5:16 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"The advice from the FCO is against non-essential travel to France. If you decide to travel against UK government advice it's important you check your insurance policy. There are ""high risk"" providers but only you can decide if it's worth it. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…"
France will reciprocate with a 14 day quarantine https://www.france24.com/en/20200813-france-…
"Apart from the tweet from the personal account of government minister, France has not yet made any official announcement of reciprocal quarantine measures. There is no mention of it on any of the Interior Ministry or the Foreign Affairs Ministry’s official channels as of this writing. https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/la-france-…While such reciprocal measures are probable, it is likely a good idea to wait a few more hours for official guidance before telling people to cancel their travel plans."
"The government announced last night that Britons travelling from France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos & Aruba must self-isolate for 14 days if they arrive in the UK after 4am on Saturday.Today, Friday, it is expected that France will reciprocate.No-one can guess at the devastation this will cause to both the British and French economies, not to mention the loss of August, September holidays and business, if not even longer than two months. No date has been given as to when the situation might be reviewed.C'est la guerre.Anthony K"
The Eurostar and Le Shuttle are already booked solid. I wonder how many people can cram onto the ferries.
"k2Don't worry, many made it back from Dunkirk, I'm sure they will be OK in dinghies.CheersAnthony K"
"""While such reciprocal measures are probable, it is likely a good idea to wait a few more hours for official guidance before telling people to cancel their travel plans.""Too late for that. French ministers are already tweeting that France will reciprocate by introducing quarantine on UK visitors to France.The government FCO has added France to its ""Do not travel unless it is essential"" list - which means that most UK travel insurance policies will not cover those going to France against this advice.Also - ""The situation is worrying: all the indicators are continuing to progress and the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus is increasing,"" said the DGS, in a weekly bulletin published on Thursday evening.This will be our first time in 13 years not visiting France in August (were due to leave tomorrow...) but given the rapid rises in infections and hospitalisations, and what seems a lax appraoch to social distancing and masks I guess it was inevitable. Tit for tat seems silly to me, when it is Franche that is now on several countries red zones, not the UK.Edited: 4:13 am, August 14, 2020 "
"Im supposed to travel on Monday to disney paris, waiting with fingers crossed that france dont announce any forced quantise until tuesday at least!"
"French Minister for European affairs has tweeted "" Une décision britannique que nous regrettons et qui entraînera une mesure de réciprocité, "" which I believe translates as ""if the british do this we will do it back to them, even though we wouldn't have raised any health objections if they hadn't done it first""https:/…1294031134121222146"
I read that previously but I'm waiting for official announcement which hasnt happen yet! Thanks
"Double-check any travel insurance policy. A friend of mine, for example, told me that ""Trailfinders will cover you for Covid"" etc, but the small print makes it clear that travelling to a country where the FCO advises against all but essential travel invalidates the policy."
"Battleface insurance seem like they will cover. We are due to head over to France next Saturday for a fortnight, debating whether to go earlier in case of a reciprocal quarantine (quarantine when home in the UK is fine due to work at home/no kids etc). If we can hold out until Thursday and just go a couple of days earlier that would be ideal.Does anyone know how likely a reciprocal action is? As it's getting on for the end of the working week, are they likely to change anything before Monday? I've not heard anything else apart from that one Tweet"
"The considered opinion is that the French are simply waiting for the UK restrictions to begin, 04.00 tomorrow, and then they will make an official announcement.Keep well allAnthony K"
"When the UK allowed travel to France I think it was about 6 days later France lifted the quarantine. This was early July. It really is a guessing game. My best suggestion is to be ready and willing to move fast.I would love to know who Anthony's ""considered opinion"" is"
"My considered opinion taken from, online, BBC, The Sun, The Independent, The Evening Standard and Simon Calder almost everywhere. I am also aware of comments made in the last few days by French Ministers of the Crown.CheersAnthony K"
"Only Paris and Marseille are in the red zone, so it is perhaps a bit excessive to punish the whole country, but it is the easiest thing to do. And it is just as easy for any Britons in France or the Netherlands to take a ferry from Belgium to get home, which kind of proves how ridiculous quarantines are in Europe when they can't really be enforced.Are you listening, Anthony?"
"@RinaW Who did you find that covers insurance during going against FO advice? Also does anyone know if and when france do announce the same thing, would they give 2 days notice like UK did? or can they start it immediately? Im hoping that they dont announce anything at least until sunday and then it starts on tuesday! That was at least i can arrive there on Monday!"
k2My decision is now irreversible. I have the promise of a full return from the Booking Agent. I also have already received a voucher from British Airways. I am now planning for June 2021.Keep wellAnthony K
"Nads - if France reciprocates, you and your family would have to quarantine on arrival in France. That means staying in for the duration which would affect your departure date. To answer your question about high risk insurance, should you choose to travel against UK government advice, this is one of the companies that offers it. I've never used it myself.www.battleface.comEdited: 11:40 am, August 14, 2020 "
""" And it is just as easy for any Britons in France or the Netherlands to take a ferry from Belgium to get home, which kind of proves how ridiculous quarantines are in Europe when they can't really be enforced. ""Definitely not as easy.There is only one ferry service from Belgium to the UK and it goes to Hull which is a long way in the North East, takes 12 hours, and is only once a day. And IIRR Belgium has been on the UK's list of countries requiring quarantine for about a week now."
"@Nads hihttps:/… I havent used it myself but will look into in more detail. They mentioned on skynews n said was about £60 for 2wks.I m still waiting on the French decision before I make mine.Good news for you Anthony.Edited: 12:19 pm, August 14, 2020 "
@52 sorry it will not happen this year but you made the right call and at least from my experience just finally making a decision reduces the stress and feels good.
"True. I have the possibility of a trip to Spain in October, which will become an April 2021 break if it has to. Paris will be a week in mid-June 2021. The one real hope of a total rest is a Jan/Feb 2021 fortnight in Hurgada, Egypt. Keep wellAnthony K"

"gardengirlEvery cell in the human body regenerates on average every 7 years; so biologically, we are brand new people every 7 years. Most of the time we look the same and the change isn’t visible unless our self-image has changed (our inner picture of who we are), then sometimes the change is visible; but usually it isn’t.

"“ And it is just as easy for any Britons in France or the Netherlands to take a ferry from Belgium to get home“The UK already classified Belgium as quarantine mandatory a week ago, so that ship has sailed. On the Dutch news this evening there was a report about Brits frantically trying to get home in time before the deadline. Flights and trains to the UK for today are fully booked. And so is the Hook of Holland - Harwich ferry which this evening will depart a couple of hours before schedule and will sail faster, so her passengers arrive in the UK before the 4:00 deadline."
"99% decided not to go esp with the high daily increase of the virus in Paris n I will hopefully go sometime next year pref in the Spring. For now I think I will go to Germany been to Berlin before, they have one of the lowest nos but that could change.Got a trip booked pre C19 in Spain/Portugal in Oct, pretty sure I wont be going n might go Italy instead but things change so far. Bit disappointed but people have lost their lives in this pandemic so my feelings are pretty insignificant compared to wider world problems. Take care people ☺Edited: 4:49 pm, August 14, 2020 "
"Forgive me if I have been misinformed, but wasn't the last quarantine period in France voluntary, with no fines being issued for people that chose not to self-isolate?"
"No, it was mandatory. You had to carry an attestation with you explaining where you were going in case the police stopped you. If you were out without an attestation, you were fined. https:/…ampEdited: 5:52 pm, August 14, 2020 "
AnnetteSo you were only stopped if you were at a station. (oops sorry.)Keep wellAnthony K
"The last quarantine for incoming tourists was ""strongly"" recommended. There was no enforcement."
"Annette the form you link to was the one to be carried by everyone during the lockdown period until May 11th. The quarantine period that was afterwards asked for people arriving from the UK was not enforced, people were required to do it but there was no control."
"Well, in that case we're still going to go. We've mainly booked rural places to stay and if they can't enforce quarantine, like they have here in the UK, then we'll just travel in our own car and follow all the local rules and quarantine upon our return to the UK."
"PARIS (Reuters) - France declared its capital Paris and the port city of Marseille high-risk zones for the coronavirus on Friday as the government reported more than 2,500 new infections for the third day in a row.The seven-day moving average of new infections, which smooths out reporting irregularities, increased to 2,041, doubling over the last two weeks.Anthony K"
"All depends on you. A) Visit France and be quarantined 14 days by the U.K. B) Visit some place other than France in two weeks. As indicated by the U.K, French citizens visiting the U.K. will be quarantined when they return home."
"I sincerely hope France do not reciprocate in imposing the same measures as the U.K. government, however who could blame France if they did? How can UK tourists be less safe in France (most likely in rural and vastly spacious areas and masked up), yet here in the U.K. we have had jam packed beaches, pubs re-opened, night goers, only recently introduced “masks for all” while shopping, not to mention the crowds taking part in protests?This article from today’s Daily Telegraph gives pause for thought...“On July 25, the French government changed the rules on testing. Hitherto, the only way to avoid paying for a standard PCR test, in which your nose and throat are swabbed, was to get a prescription from your doctor. But after the rule change, anyone could get a test free of charge. Not surprisingly, the number of people getting tested jumped – more than 600,000 people in the past week – and case numbers duly increased.We’ve seen exactly the same pattern in parts of the UK: community testing increases and there’s a corresponding rise in recorded infections.”Edited: 10:30 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Soph, thanks for the clarification. You were able to read RJP’s mind much better than I was. I thought he was asking about Frances initial quarantine period for everyone in the country LOL"
"Apologies for the confusion Annette, I should have made it more clear that I was referring to quarantine and not the lock down period in France."
"We have decided to go early on Monday rather than waiting until the weekend as planned, hopefully to avoid a reciprocal quarantine. We are staying rurally so hoping the risk will be lower than in our large city with lots of local bars/pubs/shops and runners zooming past you without leaving any distance! Fingers crossed it works out ok!"
Is it safe to say that Uk travellers will not be forced into quarantine in france when we get off the ferry still?I haven't heard any news from french government still and we are travelling tomorrow morning (monday 17th august).Just wanted to know if anyone has heard anything new that could potentially ruin our holiday?
The FCO site is still saying no quarantine and as this is a big holiday weekend in France hopefully nobody will slap a quarantine on tonight.
"French authorities cannot force any one into quarantine, last time it happened it was on a voluntary basis (everyone had to do it, but it was not enforced, so you deal with your conscience). You will have to quarantine when back to the UK though, and bear in mind that French numbers are not good."
"SophYou are the Queen of the understatement. To say that ""French numbers are not good"" is like saying that World War II was just a skirmish. Keep wellAnthony K"
"Serious question, apologies if already asked - If you go to France from UK and back what happens on the return to the UK? How is quaratine inforced? ThanksEdited: 11:54 am, August 16, 2020 "
Barry on the Passenger Locator Form you have to give the address of where you will be staying for the 14 days quarantine. There is then the possibility that you will be subject to a random check that you are there.
Thanks JBart.Do you know what form the random check takes? House visit?
"Oh is it, i thought they install the track and trace app on your phone and track your whereabouts from your phones GPS? Probably read that wrong then!"
