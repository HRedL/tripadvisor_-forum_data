"Hmm. We'll be there for one day in April. Mozzies do tend to enjoy biting me. Great, now I'm paranoid. "
"No worries:I was just in Tahaa about a week ago and had no mosquito problems. Just use alittle mosquito spray. If you are staying at a resort like Le Tahaa please know that these resorts spray for bugs. Mosquitos breed in standing water. Locals live close to the jungles and often have standing water in containers etc. If you were living in the jungle I'd probably be concerned. Otherwise, just alittle spray on your legs and arms in the a.m. and early evening when mosquitos are most active will do the trick.sunny regards,shully"
Have there been any recent updates on this? Have they had new cases?
