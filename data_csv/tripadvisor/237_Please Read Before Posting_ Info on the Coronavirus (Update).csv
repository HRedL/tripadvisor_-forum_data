"Hi, recently there are travellers who are understandably concerned about the coronavirus situation in Singapore and the impact on their travel plans.As the situation is constantly evolving and no one has the ability to see the future, please assess the current updates posted by authoritative sources (beware of fake news) and travel advisories issued by your country’s government/consulate/foreign office, weigh them against the personal health conditions and age of those in your travelling party, your level of risk tolerance and decide what is best for yourselves. Don’t rely on strangers on the internet to tell you what to do.The following are links to official sites that can help you make that decision:Immigration and Checkpoints Authorityhttps:/…updates-on-border-control-measuresSingapore Government and Ministry of Healthhttps://www.moh.gov.sghttps://www.gov.sgChangi Airport and Jewelhttps:/…COVID-19.htmlhttps:/…Singapore Airlineshttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trans…Singapore Mediahttps://www.straitstimes.com/coronavirus?https:/…https:/…https://www.todayonline.comHawker Centreshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…FAQsInpatient bill of confirmed coronavirus patients at public hospitals to be paid by Singapore Government https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…https:/…ar-BBZvowXhttps://tinyurl.com/rp4ylkchttps://www.gov.sg/article//infectious-disea…https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/discharged…https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…World Health Organisationhttps:/…novel-coronavirus-2019https:/…travel-adviceAll the best whatever your decision may be.

"The total number of cases will increase unless there are no new infections. I think it is more accurate to look at the current number of cases since the recovery rate in Singapore is high.As long as there is still travelling going on, imported cases (and from there community spread) are going to be a risk to every country. Every country needs to be prepared and do its part to control the virus from spreading. Everyone needs to practise good personal hygiene and be socially responsible by staying at home if they are sick.Edited: 12:27 pm, March 06, 2020 "

"Most of the cases are imported and local transmissions have been kept under reasonable control. So the picture in Singapore is not all that gloomy at least as of now. The revised requirement of 14 day SHN notice covering every person who enters Singapore kicked in from 21st March and from 24th March, short term visitors were totally banned. I guess it will take a few days for the effect of these measures to be noticeable. The blanket 14 day SHN to all arriving persons followed by the ban on short term visitors will hopefully help break the chain. That means all those who bring in infections from abroad will be confined to their homes (or hospital) and won't pass on the infection to others in the city. If local transmissions continue to remain in control, I hope that we will begin to see a drop in new cases, say in around 10 days time. That's my opinion and I am no expert."
A huge hike of 73 new cases today.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…
Travellers to Singapore will receive notice of stay-home requirement before arrivalhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…
>>Travellers to Singapore will receive notice of stay-home requirement before arrival<<I understand total ban on short term visitors continues so this requirement is not applicable to short term visitors.
"Hi MRahul, you are right that it does not apply to short term visitors as of now. I’m just updating this development since it is related to SHN in general."

"I've already cancelled our trip for this summer, so just curious at this point. If you had to guess, how long will that type of thing be required (the deal with China) before they move on to other countries for essential travel, and when would you guess tourism will be allowed again? I'd really like to reschedule our trip for next summer."

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence. All other travellers entering Singapore will continue to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, for now."""

"Singapore should be ready for tourism by the end of this year/start of next year. The local transmission rate is low (hoping that there won't be a second outbreak) and we have started easing travel restrictions (i.e. expanding flight schedule to include more cities). Planning a trip for next summer should be possible, but of course, I would still wait until Oct-Nov before confirming your travels."
