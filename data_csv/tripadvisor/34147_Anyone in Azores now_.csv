I like to hear words about the current situation? See many travellers? Are things opened as expected? People receptive?
"There are few tourists because of the special rules about entry that apply to the Azores.That is the first thing to check. You may not be allowed in any time soon.This has been discussed and detailed in many previous Q & A in this forum. For example, the most recent posts in this item - https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…"
I'm aware of those rules and I've read the forum for the past month. I'm more interested in reports of what's happening on the ground.
"I am on holiday on the Azores right now. Arrived with SATA in an almost empty plane in Ponta Delgada. The test is good organized, administration took a while but in less than 30 minutes it was done. I have to say that we were the first in line. Maybe if you arrive with a full flight and there is a line, it can take a lot of time. The official speech is that you wait in the hotel for the result of the the test, but...After 48h still no result, after a call to the telephone number they provide, no information. Next day the hotel called for us. Seems that 2 of 3 of us are tested, the other one not yet... but no message or text received. Another day later, we made another call, all tested, but no message because we don’t have a Portuguese number... and email they didn’t think about I guess. Anyway, no message, no proof, but we can (legally) travel.Very few tourist here in San Miguel, what makes the hikes in nature very nice!! Most restaurants are open, touristic activities can be booked. All swimming pools are closed, also in hotels. Swimming is only allowed in the sea. Soon gonna travel to other islands. 2nd test no news yet."
Thanks Yaba. That’s exactly what I was looking for. Waiting 3 days for test results is a bit concerning. I will have a inter island flight after 24 hours. I supposed that you are not Portuguese?
"Hi, what type of test is this? Is it the Q-tip through the nose almost into your brain or just a mouth swab? Thanks"
"I am from the Netherlands.We were told that it is highly unlikely that there will be a check of the negative test result before boarding a domestic flight. But, let’s say that nobody is 100% sure.The test is in the nose and in the mouth."
"The mandatory test is a PCR test, no other test is considered valid here. Don't bring serology tests, not valid.The rule is that you don't flight inter-island if you don't have a negative test - I will have a inter island flight after 24 hours - not a good option on these days. The Azores government has reached agreements with labs on the mainland so that portuguese going there will do the test before, it was clear after the 1st 2 weeks that the labs at Ponta Delgada and Terceira can not respond in 12h (as originally announced). The reports from travelers were at least 50h to receive the result and people ""stranded"" in S. Miguel not able to fly to other islands. CONNECTIONS INTER-ISLANDSIf you intend to travel inter-islands, either by air or by sea, you do not need a previous authorisation from the Regional Health Authority, and you should act as follows:a) The passengers should communicate that intent, on arrival, to the health authority by filling in the proper form;b) The passengers that perform the SARS-CoV-2 test on arrival to the Region, in case they have another island as final destination, must remain in prophylactic isolation at the place they are lodged or in a hotel room designated for that purpose, until they are informed of the NEGATIVE result of the test. Only then may they proceed with their trip;c) The passengers that present a previous NEGATIVE SARS-CoV-2 test, in case they have another island as final destination, may go to that island;d) The above mentioned passengers, as soon as they arrive to the final destination island, must oblige to the procedures previewed in the part concerning the contact to the County Health Authority on the 6th day to perform the SARS-CoV-2 test."
"We are on Pico now, after staying on Sao Miguel first, on the 8th day of our 11-day stay. First test went smoothly, we got the result after about 36 hours. We isolated until we had the results, which was possible because of our great hosts (food and groceries). On the island it's quiet, and sometimes I get the feeling of being the odd one out. Most people are still very nice and friendly, and for activities the quiet is a big plus. Fewer whale-watching boats means better views, and all the sites such as Sete Cidades are nice and quiet.About the sixth-day test, that is somewhat messy. I sent an e-mail on the fifth day to be sure, but I got no response. After some more days and phonecalls I was able to schedule the sixth-day test, but I wonder if it would have happened if I hadn't gone the extra mile.So in summary: the situation has positives and negatives. I wouldn't book a vacation now, but if you had already booked before (like we did) you can come and still have a good time."

@jort85 Thanks for that report
"I’m in Ponta Delgada now under isolation. I did a COVID test 72 hours before departure and the result was rejected. They insist that it should be done 72 hours before arrival, regardless what the Azores government web site says. SMH."
Would be interested to know how long it take to get result.Due to fly in Sept who knows what situation will be then.Don't know how to get a test in UK if I don't have symptoms ( anyone?). We land on Ponta Delgardo but on day 6 we'll be on Pico anyone know about testing there...
12 to 48 hours according to the nurse there.
"I am going in August, apparently, you get your results in 12 from the test."
"I am going in August with my son, Are there many whale watching tours on?"
"In my opinion you will have no problems getting a tour. You will either join a group or they will do it just for you. There are plenty of operators and everybody needs money, especially now. I am sure you will be able to negotiate an acceptable deal for yourself."
12 to 48 hours according to the nurse there - on a weekend? It will be interesting to know if it took such a short time.
"I see that that the warm water swimming pools are all closed. Are there any restrictions on entering the natural pools as well in Pico or Sao Miguel? Whenever I search for a Piscina, Google tells me that it is temporarily closed. Sorry, have never been to the Azores, so I do not know if the access is controlled or not."
"The testresult took more than 48 hours. And it seems that is not an exception. So be prepared! No problem to find tours, a lot of the companies are working, some restaurants are closed, but still enough are open to eat (very) good.All swimming pools are closed. But swimming in the ocean and in nature is allowed.On google a lot is temporary closed but it’s not always up to date, so check the website or give them a call."
"What Yaba says.The testresults can take quite long. I'm already back home and I havent had the result of my sixth-day test yet... However for the initial test on arrival it took 36 hours in my case, but I have heard of many cases in which it took longer.Whale watching tours shouldn't be a problem, I went on Sao Miguel and on Pico and even though there were fewer clients, they do still go. And honestly, I had two of the best tours I've ever been on, because there are fewer boats in the water and people in the boat. The natural pools are open and you should definitely go there. Just look out if there are no Portuguese Man'o wars in the water where you are swimming. The first pool I went to didn't have any, but another one did and so no-one was swimming there. And if you see them: don't.All in all we had a great time, if you have a trip planned I would recommend going. Just be mindful of your isolation time upon entering."
"To Avonord, see below, not sure why your test wasn't accepted thought it was posted from someone in Portugal so maybe arriving from Portugal/Europe/Canada/US is different...Post on another thread ""just received confirmation from Airport Tourism Office in Ponta Delgada:Negative test must be taken up to 72 hours before your flight departure (before embarkation)"""
"Do you know if you can technically take the second test on one island and visit the next one while waiting for the results? I planned Sao Miguel for the end of the month but given the situation, I am reconsidering maybe after the first result spending more time on Pico and Sao Jorge instead leaving Sao Miguel for another time. It would then make sense for me to do the second test on Pico and travel between the two islands."
I'd also like to know if I can fly to Pico if I don't have the result from the test done in Ponta Delgarda on arrival
"Official website, with info and also the forms to fill at arrival https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?page_id=5532CONNECTIONS INTER-ISLANDS - rulesIf you intend to travel inter-islands, either by air or by sea, you do not need a previous authorisation from the Regional Health Authority, and you should act as follows:a) The passengers should communicate that intent, on arrival, to the health authority by filling in the proper form;b) The passengers that perform the SARS-CoV-2 test on arrival to the Region, in case they have another island as final destination, must remain in prophylactic isolation at the place they are lodged or in a hotel room designated for that purpose, until they are informed of the NEGATIVE result of the test.

So if I read that correct if I arrive on the Saturday evening without a test and have one done at Ponta Delgarda then I can't fly to Pico on the following Wednesday if I haven't received the result. So what happens to the accomadation and flights I've booked and where do I stay in Ponta Delgarda as I won't have a hotel booking there...Thanks
"So what happens to the accommodation and flights I've booked - you loose it... if you don't have the result till Wednesday. where do I stay in Ponta Delgada as I won't have a hotel booking there... They have the wording ""or in a hotel room designated for that purpose"" but probably you'll have to pay for it."
"So that means I'd also lose flights and accommodation in Terceira, as the flight there is from Pico, if it takes over 90 hrs for a result when they say 48 hrs..."
"After the test on arrival, they offered to pay for their designated hotel. Since I already had my hotel booked and it can’t be cancelled, I rejected the offer. The test took 51hours for me and my wife.Edited: 5:36 am, July 21, 2020 "
"Thanks for letting us know time for results. I'd be grateful for any trip report - what's open restaurants, trips, museums. Although that could all change in the next 6 weeks."
"We have taken test on arrival 3 days ago. We called the indicated number after not getting results after 48 hours and then got them immediately over the phone. There are plenty of people arriving with negative test done on beforehand (about 50 pct from our flight). Most got accepted.However make sure your test is within 72 hours from ARRIVAL in Azores, not departure. That is what seems to count here."
"Great stuff here. Thanks all. But after reading and re-reading all of the responses along with the official guidance it is still unclear how I can complete my intended trip with my family. We are set to arrive on Sao Miguel on a Monday at 6 AM for an eight day trip that includes 4 days on Flores. If we arrive with clean tests conducted within the 72-hour window (I'll listen to what I've read here and make sure to backtrack from arrival, not departure, despite the clear wording in the official guidance!) then my Day 6 will occur on Flores where there is no testing. I'm considering shortening the trip to seven days just to avoid the necessity of the Day 6 test requirement but even that is fraught with logistical issues as the return flight home a day earlier is booked solid. Any thoughts are appreciated."
"Just returned after a week stay in Furnas. We had the most wonderful time as it’s so quiet. Aside from pools, everything is open eg we went whale watching. I highly recommend Terra do Pico if you decide to. We had no problem getting food, renting our car, kayaking in the green lake in Cete Cidades. We had to do a Covid test at the airport as they didn’t accept our UK NHS one as it didn’t state which test was performed. That was the only negative. It’s my second trip there and I really love the place. You’ll go to places and feel like you have the whole place to yourself. Enjoy!"
How long I did it take to get your results...
"How long did it take yo get your results sorry it said problem with previous post submit againEdited: 6:57 am, July 25, 2020 "
We arrive to Sao Miguel from Madeira on August 16.We would have already had a PCR Test on arrival in Madeira on August 8.We have a flight to Pico island on. the same arrival day to Sao Miguel which is August 16.Do you think it would not possible to take the Sao Miguel - Pico flight? As we'd need to wait for the results?Thank you
Were you confined to your hotel for all three days?
"Also SH how did you manage to get test on NHS, did you say you had symptoms..."
"@doug For first test, yes. Confined in hotel room until negative results are given."
"@doug BTW, second test is a breeze. In and out of the test centre in 15 minutes."
"We arrive to Sao Miguel from Madeira on August 16. We would have already had a PCR Test on arrival in Madeira on August 8 - Not valid to enter Azores (too much time will have be passed since the negative result), you'll have to do a test at arrival or get a way of doing one at Madeira 72h before arriving to Azores.We have a flight to Pico island on. the same arrival day to Sao Miguel which is August 16. Do you think it would not possible to take the Sao Miguel - Pico flight? As we'd need to wait for the results? Without a negative result, no you can not.

"@Avonord: Did you get a list of clinics for the second test? I am wondering about the operating hours for testing. If my 6th day falls on a Sunday and all clinics are closed, I'm wondering if I should show up on the 5th day or 7th...Edited: 4:50 pm, July 25, 2020 "
I keep a personal travel blog about my COVID travel experience in Azores. Feel free to look. https://brucepoon.wordpress.com/
"@YOW They call you and they will assign a time. Or alternative, send them an email. On arrival at the airport, they will give you the contact info.Edited: 5:38 pm, July 25, 2020 "
Are there any testing facilities in Sao Jorge?And there is also the need of waiting for the results before flying/taking a boat?
"Are there any testing facilities in Sao Jorge? If you mean a lab, no there's not. Since you have to fill forms about where in Azores you'll be, you will receive that info at arrival."
"Thanks for the info.Our 6th day will coincide with us being in Sao Jorge, and we don't know how will that be sorted out as on the 8th day we plan to fly back to Sao Miguel"
"How does it happen when we are on another island with no testing facility during the 6th day (Sao Jorge), will we be allowed to leave with a plane to Sao Miguel on the 8th day or not? Thanks for help"
I have just called them. Every island has a testing facility. There is no need to wait for the results of the 6th day before taking the plane.
"Cool! I thought that some islands like Flores do not have a testing facility. Anyway, I envy you. As an American I can not go to Azores and it does not look like it will change any time soon"
Those islands don't have labs that will do the test. They have places called Covid19 centers (it can an health center or any other location) where a nurse will collect the sample and will ship it to Terceira or S. Miguel to process it.
Thanks! Do you have to be quarantined while the samples are analyzed?
"Do you have to be quarantined while the samples are analyzed? On arrival, yes. From the testimonies of those being there for the day 6, no you don't have (at least for now). But looking at the government reports about new cases there were at least a couple of positive cases at day 6 (the case of the only case at Flores, for instance), so maybe one of these days they will change it..."
Hi Melanie - NHS result was within 24 hours via text and email. We never received the Azorean results back.
Re NHS test - I signed up on the government website. I know my sis ticked no symptoms and still got a test.
"Not sure if this reply was aimed at me but we had negative tests from the NHS, which were not accepted on arrival. We took tests at Ponta Delgada but the results were not sent to us. Given that we knew we were negative, we did not self-isolate in the hotel."
"@SH I’m not flaming you. But that may not be a good idea, much less posting it on a public forum. This may have legal consequences. It’s always advisable to following someone else’s rules when at someone else’s house.Edited: 2:42 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"I am planning to be there this week, i dont want to give a wrong impressiom here but does isolation mean that you can go to the supwrmarket to buy food for yourself? Or even something like this is not allowed?"
"I met a group of Brits out there who did the exact same NHS test with the same documentation, which was accepted by the authorities there. They did not have to retest, hence, different rules are being applied to the same documentation. I had full confidence in my government’s testing. The only reason they didn’t accept it was because the email did not mention PCR testing. I did a PCR test which was negative."
"Isolation means staying in hotel room until negative results are given. If you use the hotel room room provided by government, then the room and food are free, at least that’s true 2 weeks ago."
@SH Did you take an in person test or home test? I did a home test last week and the email/text result I received did not have the time the test was taken in it.
"Avonard,What was that like being confined to your room? I can't imagine being stuck inside on paradise for three days. I'll be traveling with my wife, teenage daughter and 10-yr old son. Losing three of our eight days stuck inside watching Portugese television does not seem worth the effort. Test results within 72 hours of departure are currently not offered (or guaranteed, at least) in my area."
"@DougIf I only have 8 days in Azores and I had to isolate, then I would not have come. I have 4 weeks here. If you choose to come, then get a nice Airbnb facing the sea (instead of using the room provided by the government), assuming the host is willing to get food supplies for you. Or at minimum, get a nice room with a balcony. UberEats was available in Ponta Delgada, but choices were very very limited."
"I am going on the 15th for a week, I thought the government gave you a test on arrival and you got the results in 12 hours? But to be on the safe side, I am going to get an NHS drive-through test 72 hours before we arrive. Has anybody else done this?"
"I got my result 52 hours after my test. The test sample was collected on a Saturday morning. The test was apparently completed Saturday night. But the test result was never passed to the official channel until Monday morning, possibly because they don’t work weekends. It’s “possible” that it’s quicker if you come during weekdays, but I can’t say for sure."
"Got my results after 36 hrs. Tested 00:10 on friday and was confirmed on 12:00 saturday. I had to call them because i have a flight in the afternoon. I thinknit depends on what day and time you land as well. I have a friend who was tested at 13:00 and got results in 12 hrs. But its really unsure and depends. From my experience, If you have an interconnecting flight, please keep a buffer 36-48hrs. And then fingers crossed"
"Hello,In what form the test result has to be presented? In Toronto the test result is on line.If I am staying only for 6 days and leaving on 7-th day afternoon should I still get a second test?Thank you."
"@lavenderI got tested in Toronto as well. But they rejected the result because of the timing. Read my blog (link posted in a previous reply). Even if the timing is right, I don’t know if they will accept it because they require the result to be signatured according to their site. You could try calling or emailing them, but the number seems to be dialable from Azores only. And the email, they don’t always reply."
"My experience:I arrived on August 1st at 17:10 on a flight from London. The testing is carried out in tents in front of the airport. There were people completing the paper form there, but we completed the online survey and we got to go ahead of them. The testing is really quick. We were on our way after 30 minutes.The results came by email, the next day at 12:44, the exact time when the daily stats were published on the Azores government website.Edited: 4:05 am, August 05, 2020 "

"#Tudor, that's really good to know, we arrive around the same time on a Sat (from Stansted) and was worried that as it's a weekend it would take a lot longer. I've read reports that some NHS tests done in the UK are being rejected as it doesn't say what test was performed and some say you also need a signature."
"Hi all!I have some (maybe dumb) questions about PCR testing.The 72h are referred to the moment when the test was done (i.e extracting half of your nose) or when the result is posted?As usually labs take minimum 24-48 to give results, this makes a huge difference if the considered date is one or the other.Related to this question. I am considering also visiting Lisbon before and do the PCR test there. Anyone has tried this? How easy is to set an appointment?And more important. If you do the test, but your result is not ready when you fly to Azores, could you jut isolate until the continental test posts the result or you have to do a second test in the airport and restart the count?Thanks a lot!Edited: 10:25 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Donee, not posted"
"I am considering also visiting Lisbon before and do the PCR test there. Anyone has tried this? How easy is to set an appointment? The Azores government has a contract with several labs in Lisbon that do the test according to the rules, free of charge with advance booking and having to show your flight ticket to the region. Here's the list, scroll down and find ""Lisboa"" https://destinoseguro.azores.gov.pt/wp-conte…"
"If you do the test, but your result is not ready when you fly to Azores, could you jut isolate until the continental test posts the result or you have to do a second test in the airport and restart the count? I doubt it very much, they are not being very flexible, so do your planning in a way that you have to have the test with you before or just assume that you'll do it at arrival there."
Thanks!More difficult then
"Ops. Even more difficult then... I thought that being an official partner lab could be considered differently.Anyway, the result of the test must be printed or it could be an email from the lab?"
"Anyway, the result of the test must be printed or it could be an email from the lab? To be honest, I would ALWAYS print all these kind of documents... and have the email as backup, even from a lab that is on the official list."
"Just got the following reply from Azores authority.... too late for me. But may be useful for others. —Bom dia,Acusamos a receção da sua mensagem, lamentando o atraso na resposta, que poderá ter comprometido a utilidade da mesma e que se deveu ao elevado número de solicitações recebidas.No seguimento do seu contacto, a Linha Verde de Apoio ao Cidadão do Governo dos Açores em resposta ao pedido de informação, efetuado por V.

According to the staffs, the test had to be completed 72 hours before arrival, not before departure. Can you please clarify? If this is wrong, please correct your web site because this is causing lots of grief with many passengers on arrival. Thanks"
"I'm confused, according to translate that still say 72 hours before departure or am I miss reading/translating..."
"@MelanieYea, i got the same translation. I think the email is saying the web site is correct: it’s 48 hours before arrival rather than departure. The airport staff was incorrect. Was the airport staff was re-trained? I’ve no idea. To be safe, i would suggest getting a test 48 hours before arrival if possible."
You mean 72 not 48....
How are they enforcing isolation?
"If you are asking if a police is going to be at your door 24h, no it's not. Of course that if you test positive and you are not where you were supposed to be you'll be committing a crime and will be charged. Your personal respect for the others is supposed to be important by staying isolated till you have the result."
@melanieOops. Yes. 72. Sorry.
"Of course, I am not even planing on going if my test is positive, but assuming the test is negative, I am not sure if they accept results brought over or requiring to administer their own test. In that case. having to wait for the results of a test taken there, it would be a waste to stay in a hotel room for half the stay."
"@travelIMHO.. Whether you think your test is valid or whether you think you are safe to travel is irrelevant. If you break isolation without local Azores authority certifying you as “safe”, then it’s illegal. And good luck arguing with a local judge your interpretation of the law on a ... let’s say.. 2021 court date. That’s why I always stick with the most conservative interpretation of the law when travelling. But that may be just me."
"To be honest, I am now deciding if go or not to go to Azores. Complication with the test on the airport, waiting for results and on 6th day do the test again (!). It's quite annoying. Of course I will loose money for flight tickets etc. Do you recommend to go there despite the conditions ? My flight is on 24th Aug - 2 Sep. Thanks. Radek"
"I arrived yesterday (Aug 11th) from London. Arrived here at 17h and got the test (which was negative) at 9AM today. Remember to do the survey online BEFORE you come, that helped us A LOT, the process was much much faster at the airport."
"@radekThe 6th day test was pretty quick. Was in and out after 20 minutes max. The site was very close to Ponta Delgada if that’s where you are staying. If it’s me, and I’ll lose money on the flight, I would still go. Just do everything you can to do the test in your home country, and cross your fingers."
"@MarcosThat’s pretty fast. Again, in my case, the delay was in the reporting rather than the testing. I arrived Saturday morning and didn’t get result until Monday, even though the test itself was completed Saturday night. That was 3 weeks ago though. Maybe things had improved since."
