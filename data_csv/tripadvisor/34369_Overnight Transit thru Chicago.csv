Looking for advice.My brother is currently travelling home from Chile to Ireland via Miami and then Chicago to Dublin.He is travelling with an Irish passport and will have 1 night in a Chicago waiting for his Aer lingus flight home to Dublin this Thursday.He has booked a room at the Hilton Chicago Airport. However due to COVID19 restrictions will he be allowed pass thru the airport ? He is not an American citizen so is he allowed leave the airport for his stay at the hotel before he boards his onward flight to Dublin ?Hoping someone in the know can advise - thanks.
"Coming from Chile en route to Eire, it appears he will be able to enter the U.S. but maybe depending on how recently he was in any of the listed prohibited countries.https:/…from-other-countries.htmlEdited: 5:11 pm, May 19, 2020 "
Boy that list is sure outdated now.
"Trump announced today he is considering a travel ban on Latin America, so stay posted."
He’s flying from Miami to Chicago. There’s no restrictions for travel within the United States. The trick is connecting in Miami.
Ok so reading that as he’s coming into US from Chile he should be fine to transit thru US and stay in hotel in Chicago for one night. Thanks
The USA doesn’t have the concept of transit passengers. He will have to enter the USA in Miami as if he was here fir an extended visit. If he’s an Irish citizen he’ll need an ESTA. As long as he hasn’t been in Europe for two weeks the covid restrictions shouldn’t be an issue.
"""Trump announced today he is considering a travel ban on Latin America,""I thought it was just for Brazil he was stating?"
"Like usual he really wasn’t specific. It was in response to a question. He says a lot of stuff that he never actually does. Or he ends up doing a lot less than what he said.If he does ban travel from Latin American countries, no one will know until a day or two before he does it."

Update : he was allowed to enter US as he had NOT been in the list of countries in the CDC during the last 2 weeks. He also has a valid ESTA. So thankfully he has made his way to Chicago and checked into his hotel last night. He’s leaving on a flight this evening to Dublin where he will quarantine for 2 weeks.Thanks for those who provided helpful replies
Glad to help.
