I never go by these review guides....to me it is by word of mouth or an actual experience. Sounds like Zagat just wants to make more $$$ North of the Border.
True...so do you think Montrealers or other Canadians vsiting the city would buy Zagats? I am no expert but since I live in close proximity to a major resto city (NYC) I have always gone by the recommendations of friends who dine out frequently or I do the adventurous thing and try it myself.
PS...Of course we also have a bedbug epidemic so maybe they should produce a guide to bugfree hotels :)
"I find it funny luv, that every restaurant is ""zagat"" rated on Mulberry st lol so NOT true!!!! "
I agree Bella the Zagat signs in so many restos remind me of the people that place security signs in their yards even though they do not have the system installed :)If Zagat hopes to be a success this time around then they had better print it in both Francais and Anglais.
