"There is no travel ban for American citizens to enter the UK, is there? They are no longer in the EU and should not be affected by that, plus I could not find any mentioning of it on their gov.uk web site. My friend wants to go there in late may or early June, thanks in advance!!"
"No there is no ban, but depending where they are coming from and where they are planning to visit, there might be little transport and neither hotels Nor restaurants open! Not a good time to travel right now - see “pandemic”."
"Your friend should reconsider. Until we know when restrictions will be lifted, we are in a state of lockdown with all but essential travel banned. Shops, restaurants, bars, hotels are all closed aside from those needed for people to get by. Understandably, this is not a time to consider visiting the country and potentially putting even more strain on the health service."
"Surely your friend is not serious? Does s/he not have any personal responsibility? Just because there is no ban doesn’t mean s/he should travel. She could be bringing the virus with her or take it back with her. Apart from maybe needing hospital treatment and s/he will be stretching our NHS.All non essential travel is banned at present, so what does s/he plan to do. Our government is saying that social distancing is here to stay for some time yet. Be a responsible friend and tell s/he not to travel."
Well she may have to stay in her hotel room if she can find one and only go out once a day for a short time for exercise - walking.She will need accommodation where she gets meals if that's possible otherwise queue at a supermarket and only get what she needs maintaining an 8ft distance at all times. This takes the best part of an hour and is suggested only once every 2 weeks.No sitting on park benches for any length of time but straight back to accommodation.She won't be able to travel to any sights.Seems a little crazy even if she did get in to come to sit in an hotel in a coronavirus hot spot and see nothing.
"Welcome to Tripadvisor today ..I would recommend that your friend makes their own enquiries from official U.K. sources rather than relying on advice passed on, via you, from a bunch of strangers on an unmonitored worldwide pubic website forum.Alternatively, your friend could tell UK Border Force, if they actually manage to get a flight here, that people on Tripadvisor said it would be fine.."
"""This takes the best part of an hour and is suggested only once every 2 weeks.""Where is the suggestion of once every two weeks from? I haven't seen but could have missed it. I go to the supermarket a couple of times a week, longest I have had to queue is ten minutes. (Not that my experiences should influence the original poster)"
"Late May /early June should be ok in 2021, no guarantee though, but not in 2020.We are now in an officially extended lockdown until 'at least' 7 May.IMO it would be crazy for your friend to continue with the plan as indicated. Please tell her she should STAY AT HOME and not attempt to visit UK then."
There is no point in even thinking of coming here until the lockdown restrictions have started to be eased.
Please learn the circumstances before you start condemning people!! She is going to move to Europe permanently
"Not yet she isn't. and if you want people to know all the circumstances before answering , then you should have given all the details. ."
It doesn't matter if she's planning to move permanently or not. People are bring advised not to travel. People shouldn't be making international journeys unless they have no choice whatsover. A US citizen also can't just move to the UK but that's another issue entirely.
"Ridiculous, we are not mind readers how would we know she’s moving permanently.Still not going to happen."
"'Who knows by June ,the Corona virus can be all over or worse.' If the coronavirus pandemic is 'all over' by June 2020 I will eat my hat. Without salt.'Things are starting to move quickly in the usa to start reopening on May 1. It appears from what I am reading is the UK is not moving as fast as the USA to reopen.' There are valid reasons why the first should not happen and that the second isn't going to happen as a three week extension to the lockdown has been put in place in the UK.As for the truculent OP, this 'They [the UK] are no longer in the EU and should not be affected by that' is only partly correct. The UK may have left the EU but have agreed to be bound by EU regulations through 31 December 2020.As well, this 'My [American] friend wants to go there in late may or early June' makes no mention of relocating.Unless exceptional circumstances I suspect the Home Office may take a dim view of relocation to the UK at this time, but that depends on quite a lot the OP hasn't disclosed."
"#17 In this country we actually listen to the experts. We then accept they know more than us and adopt their advice and convey it to others. Basically, the exact opposite of your President and Fox News. Tell your friends that one too."
"Re post 17, please tell us your medical background. Epidemiology and virology aren't my areas of expertise, but more than 35 years in the clinical area have been enlightening in other ways."

"One doesn't need or claim to be an infectious disease expert to know that there is as yet no indication of when and how our restrictions may be lifted.We know they are definitely continuing into May. We know that those who are infectious disease experts are very cautious about the prospects for lifting any of the restrictions, and we know that other countries in Europe are proceeding very gradually and piecemeal, with the possibility that restrictions will be reimposed if the situation worsens rather than improving. It's therefore entirely reasonable, indeed the only responsible thing to do, to advise the OP that there is little to no point attempting to travel to, or even within, the UK, other than in exceptional and emergency circumstances.And we also know that, even without a pandemic, it just isn't possible for a US citizen to decide to relocate permanently to the UK without going through extensive official procedures first."
An interesting read on one American company's take on COVID-19.https:/…world-us-canada-52311877
We are currently being told by the UK government to postpone moving house or flat even if that move is just down the road.
"Ok the President of the USA has said he intends opening up the USA.Makes good headlines The financial markets improveTrumps chances of re- election increaseThe world becomes a better place overnight Except for one or two factsThe virus cannot read The virus doesn’t give a hoot for politicians and their aspirations There will be travel restrictions and travellers concerned about their health until a virus is produced and available in mega quantitiesEdited: 3:39 am, April 17, 2020 "
">>I was just telling my friends that some of the TA destination experts are suddenly infectious disease experts.<<Some of them may well be. I have got 25 years of research experience on assorted infectious diseases for example and have spent some time recently on Covid19 risk assessments.....I very much doubt I'm the only one in that position on TA and I very much doubt that I'm close to being the most qualified either given some of the PMs I have exchanged with individuals here over the years.Edited: 4:21 am, April 17, 2020 "
">>There will be travel restrictions and travellers concerned about their health until a virus is produced and available in mega quantities<<I assume you mean ""until a vaccine is produced"".I recently saw an article from a believable source* saying that there is no vaccine against any other corona-virus, and there was no reason to expect that one would be developed for COVID-19. After all, there is no vaccine against the common cold. Maybe we can hope for an effective treatment.* Either the Sydney Morning Herald or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Not Twitter or Donald Trump."
"Thanks SydneyNickTypo or predictive text - Who knows - whoops But thanks for correcting that There is some work taking place regarding offering existing drugs in a compassionate way.There is some anecdotal evidence that they are having some positive effects.Early days yet but hopefully scientists will find a way.Remdesivir, is one such drug and Interferon anotherLet’s hope that bio science can find a solution"
"""I recently saw an article from a believable source* saying that there is no vaccine against any other corona-virus, and there was no reason to expect that one would be developed for COVID-19. After all, there is no vaccine against the common cold. Maybe we can hope for an effective treatment.""Due to the relatively low mortality / infection rates of previous Covids, there has never really been a drive to have a vaccination. This one is particularly nasty so there shall be great focus. Because there hasn't been one in the past doesn't mean that it is not possible, just that there was no requirement."
Dear dear!The J&D stupidity virus is infecting this forum now.....When will it stop?
">>I recently saw an article from a believable source*<<Maybe they are believable - but they are off on this one, in my opinion. >>saying that there is no vaccine against any other corona-virus,<<Sorry in itself not a useful statement - other coronaviruses are not the Covid19 agent and have not had the effect. Coronas are common but not major enough to need a vaccine. yes we have had MERs and SATS but their mortality and morbidity wasn't high enough over an extended enough period to justify the issue.  >>and there was no reason to expect that one would be developed for COVID-19.<<Thats the statement in the set you cite that I find ludicrous. I can guarantee that people are trying to develop one at the moment, because I know the projects exist. My old boss for one https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cambridg…NIH in the US https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-release…Australia have one going https:/…1807573Those projects alone give reason to expect one will be developed.>>After all, there is no vaccine against the common cold. Maybe we can hope for an effective treatment.<<Total non-sequitur Im afraid. Rhinovirus are a different virus set with a different structure (non-enveloped) and cause ,in the overwhelming majority of people, a self-limiting trivial illness that means its not worth chasing what is a fast changing virus with vaccines. Struggles with the common cold just are not a reference point here."
"myrm said“ . I can guarantee that people are trying to develop one at the moment, because I know the projects exist.”Here’s a list of ongoing work In the bio science arena https:/…Edited: 7:59 am, April 17, 2020 "
"Thats a partial list though. These reporting sites do their best but they don't (indeed cannot) have everything listed by a long shot. They have cutoff criteria, they have limited staff and search time and not everyone is announcing details and historically sites like that tend to steer clear of low detail announcements...but still they list a fairly heavy whack of work.However it does highlightwhat I think is the most likely route to initial control by listing the Favilavir result highlighting that with so many compounds around, a bit of rational drug development is likely to be the fast route to therapy....vaccines will come later for long term control is where I'd place my money."
"Back to the original question. There is no ban on travel to the UK but there are laws on what you can do when you get here. The most relevant law here is that only essential travel is permitted. Unless your friend is able to prove that onward travel within the UK is essential then the only way to go is out of the UK. This is happening now to people who arrive, perhaps expecting to travel to their family here. There is little or zero prospect of UK being out of lockdown in June, we have been told to prepare for lockdown until 2022. We have been told to expect partial lifting of restrictions from time to time but anyone booking air tickets in the hope that the restrictions in force at the time may allow them in needs to prepare for being refused entry.What will help your friend? That needs to be researched. Maybe her employer here can help with documentation to show she has a job and accommodation and the job is open. Obviously the correct permissions to work here will be needed, and that’s not easy to guess in the UK presently. This isn’t really something that TA can help with much.Good luck.Edited: 7:40 am, April 18, 2020 "
"""we have been told to prepare for lockdown until 2022""Have we? By whom?"
"Lockdown until 2022 won't be sustainable. People are currently willing to endure being under what is effectively house arrest because they can see the need for it in the short term to control the spread of the disease and avoid overloading the NHS. However if the Government thinks it can just keep on rolling over the lockdown every three weeks without any sign of an exit strategy, the public will increasingly resort to civil disobedience. Any attempt to quell this could lead to civil disorder and rioting, especially if we have a hot summer."
"I've not seen anything about preparing for a lockdown until 2022, and I totally agree that it would be unsustainable to do that."

"'we have been told to prepare for lockdown until 2022' The source for this is ... what?I've seen a few articles that hint at the above but those articles were littered with conditionals speculation - X has been suggested, Y may take place, Z could occur if A does/doesn't happen - but they were the work of Philippa and Phil Space.What restrictions can be lifted may (see what I did there?) depend on availability of antiviral therapies whether favilavir, remdesivir or another and with more information about transmission and the nature of the virus itself - just how robust this thing will be in warmer weather and with continued physical distancing.From an economic and mental health perspective continued lockdown isn't sustainable, and the real potential of information fatigue leading to ignoring what needs to be done ('I've not got sick and I'm tired of all this wallop') will also need to be considered.Nonetheless, unless exceptional circumstances the OP's friend isn't likely to be relocating to the UK in the next two months."

Is that the same Sweden that is seeing a rapid increase in cases of Covid-19 and lots of calls for a lockdown?
"“We are going in nine weeks next Monday”No idea what this refers to. Statewide lockdown in PA started less than three weeks ago, some counties a few days earlier. Businesses closed exactly a month ago. First case was March 6th. First cases in the US as a whole were Jan 21 so that’s a lot more than 9 weeks ago."
">>we are going on 9 weeks next Monday. By the time you get to 9 weeks you all will think differently<<Or we might not. It all depends on how the situation develops, in your country as in mine.If you mean you're planning to travel here in nine weeks' time... well, good luck, but don't be surprised at what you might (or more likely might not) find if and when you get here."
"Re the reference to ""lockdown until 2022"" in earlier posts:I think I may have found the reference, and it 's not talking about ""lockdown until 2022"", but about the possibility that some social distancing measures may continue until 2022."
"@Aviatrix - that is a big difference from ""lockdown"" and can see physical distancing carrying on for a long time.Wonder how that is going to work for sporting events?"
"Yes, of course it's a big difference... but I think that's probably the source of what people were posting earlier. They'd read something about ""SOMETHING"" continuing to 2022, didn't quite take it in at the time and then thought the ""SOMETHING"" they had read about was the lockdown rather than just social distancing.That's just how the human mind works..."
