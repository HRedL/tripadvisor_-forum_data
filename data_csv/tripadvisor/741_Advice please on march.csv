"So like many others, we had trips planned that aren’t going to happen. Our next opportunity because of school will be March 13, 2021. We really wanted to go to Kauai and stay at poipu at the Sheraton. But I’m afraid we will get a lot of rain that time of year? Other option is Kona waikoloa Marriott on the big island. But...we really prefer Kauai. However I would rather have sun and beautiful sunsets in Kona than rain in Poipu. Thanks in advance. And I realize weather can be unpredictable. But I was in Oahu this March and it rained...a lot. I’ve been many times before and never had rain like this March so it’s kind of scared me off."
"Yeah, Kaua'i and Oahu got a LOT of rain this winter and spring. Parts of the BI and Maui did too-but not all. In fact, NW Maui where I live was only briefly removed from severe drought status.....then put right back.Of course, no one can say what March of 2021 will be like. I would say your chances of dry weather are best on Maui or BI though."
"The Waikoloa Marriott isn't in Kona, but on the Kohala Coast, one of the most reliably warm, dry parts of the state. I wouldn't put much stock in current 2020-21 school calendars, btw. Given the uncertainties, schedules may well change. That's one reason I'm hesitant to make any firm plans: I have one son still in high school, others in different colleges, and work in the schools myself. ~ ColleenEdited: 5:03 pm, June 12, 2020 "
"""I wouldn't put much stock in current 2020-21 school calendars, btw.""Good observation. The schools are likely to be closed much of the year. A recurring plan for some schools is to start on schedule and then close for 2 weeks every time anyone there gets COVID. I see a lot of PBS and internet ""schooling"" in the future."
"I don’t see in my crystal ball what flowerlover described, but the fact is that any presupposed school calendar/schedule is subject to variation, so we need to hold plans loosely. ~ Colleen"
"jlprk, that is the current plan my niece's school district has. They will be starting per the pre-existing school schedule, but will close for 14 days anytime a student or teacher is found to have contracted COVID."

Thank you
We have had good Luck with winter weather on the BI on the Kohala Coast and south Maui
"Kauai does get the most rain than any other island. This past year was fairly typical, I don't recall a lot of rain. Just a couple of storms that dumped all at one time!! If you stay in Poipu that would more than likely be the driest place to stay on the island. Rain is what makes Kauai so green and tropical."

"The fact remains that Kauai is the coolest/wettest island of them all in the winter. Will you hear people say that they had great weather? of course you will but at the same time many didn't. This forum is full of old posts from people staying on Kauai complaining about the winter weather.Luckily your plans are for the end of March/early April. Certainly better odds then January/February. If Kauai was your dream vacation then I'd do it. As for the Marriott on The Big Island, the Kohala Coast has almost year-round summer like weather, I often refer to it as the Palm Springs of Hawaii and I've never had poor weather there in the winter."
