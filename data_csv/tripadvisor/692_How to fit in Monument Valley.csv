"My plan is to leave my house in Northern California and go to Las Vegas for the night then Zion, Bryce, Arches etc. then lastly Grand Canyon back to Vegas then head home. I'm not sure how to fit Monument Valley in. Make it the last stop before Grand Canyon on the way home? Or go there after Zion and Bryce then head up to Moab then Grand Canyon? I'll be driving my car and will have between 10 days to about 14 days. I'll only be spending a day each in GC, Zion and Bryce as I've been there before.Edited: 3:02 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"I would do Zion, Bryce, Grand Canyon, Monument valley and then Arches. Connie who posts here and on Utah forum is an expert for area."
"After Zion and Bryce take Hwy 12 to Capitol Reef, highly recommended a night, very cool park.  Hwy. 12 is one of the best scenic drives in the west.Then Over to Moab, Arches-Canyonlands and down to Monument Valley, I'd go via Moki Dugway and Goosenecks to MV, next day to Grand Canyon and back over to Las Vegas.Actually reverse it so you can enter Zion from the east, always the most scenic way.https://goo.gl/maps/GMxbVn2ZAkhBVJFC9"
Monument Valley and the Four Corners area is closed until further notice due to extremely high impact of COVID-19 on the Navajo Nation. I am planning to avoid the area this summer regardless.https:/…https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.6/covid-19-imp…
"Yeah, MV is closed but it's a good drive by as well, not a whole lot to do anyway. Very scenic from the road.Goulding's is open.https://gouldings.com/Mexican Hat is another option for lodging, probably cheaper."
"Thanks. I saw that The View hotel was closed until June 8th but didn't know the whole area was closed.Since it's a Tribal park, I'm not sure who to call to find out. But I can drive through, right?Edited: 4:22 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Tour Capital Reef at night or drive Hwy 12 at night? Why?And that was a really good map route you linked. I'm squinting at my big maps so that gives me a good overview.Edited: 4:35 pm, May 23, 2020 "
I'd avoid the whole area like the plague. You will not be well received until all this is over.
"For Capitol Reef I'd try and stay a night, Torrey is your best bet.Try and spend at least 1/2 day hiking/exploring in the NP, it's a fantastic place.Not a good idea to drive at night in that area, lots of animals come out.Nope, can't do anything in MV, it's all run by the Navajo, they've been hit very hard with the virus.Still a nice view from Hwy.163 and Goulding's, I don't see a big problem driving by or even stopping a night, but that's me. Just practice the same safety/hygiene you will need to do the entire trip.Point is MV will be best to route between the Grand Canyon and Moab."
Got it Squid. Thank you so much. You saved me a week of planning. We might be moving out of the country so I really want to do this trip before we leave.And regarding the virus. We live in a rural county with no cases. We are bringing our own food (we travel a lot and always bring our own food to eat healthy) but will practice social distancing and wear masks when checking in and out of hotels. Gloves when pumping gas etc. I've come to the conclusion that this virus will be with us for many years and we need to learn to live with it.
"Just a tip for that area....they suggest stripping the bed spreads and using a lightweight sleeping bag instead of getting in the bed. Hotel bed spreads are lucky to be washed once a year. Bring your own pillows as well. They've got over 5000 cases in that small area, and presently under a 57 hour weekend curfew. I'm aware of this as I have a friend MD in Farmington."
Ignore my advice as you are returning to Las Vegas. Understood just heading back home.
Navajo reservation is the largest in the country. They are the highest per capita infected area..especially the northern part of the reservation that covers monument valley.Native American reservations can close off all roads heading through the territory except for interstates/ limited access expressways ( they can close exits) .For this visit I’d look at something different...Drive e to Nevada then head to Rly then tomoab then south then up UT 95 then to Torrey to bryce to Zion to south rim to vegas then back home. Or teverse this.
"With 14 days, here's a plan to consider from northern California.Day 1: Drive halfway to Moab, Utah.Day 2: Finish drive to Moab.Day 3, 4, 5: Arches, Canyonlands and other activities in Moab area.Day 6: Drive to Monument Valley (If Open) otherwise drive directly to Grand CanyonDay 7: Grand CanyonDay 8: Grand Canyon to Springdale, Utah/ZionDay 9: Zion to BryceDay 10: Bryce to Torrey, Utah/Capitol Reef NP via scenic byway highway 12.Day 11: Capitol ReefDay 12 and 13: Head back homeIf a stop in Las Vegas a must, then go there after the Grand Canyon and before Zion."
I'll look in to that route. When I say Vegas I just meant Vegas as a landmark. Anywhere from Beatty to east of Vegas.
