My sister and I are trying to decide between Tumbling River and Drowsy Water Dude Ranches. Any advice? We are looking for fun teen activities and excellent riding full of loping/galloping. Thanks!
"Jenny, they both have many reviews and photos here. What else are you looking for that is not in the reviews?"
Flip a coin
"If this is a consideration, the area where Drowsy Water Ranch is located was very hard hit by the pine beetle epidemic. They had to remove and burn thousands of trees. They even wrote about the problem on a blog.https:/â€¦The area where Tumbling River is located has not been as dramatically impacted by the pine beetle epidemic.Both areas have probably had some impact from the most recent spruce beetle infestation. You might want to look at traveler provided photos on the TripAdvisor reviews."
