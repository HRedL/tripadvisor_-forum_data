"Is there a site that references room cleaning standards at hotels or vacation rental condos in Hawaii? So, far I haven't seen any information about that. Thank you"
"Not an overall one, no. But you can check both the CDC for guidelines that are suggested nationwide, and individual hotel companies (Hilton, Hyatt, etc. etc) for theirs."
"Thanks AkamaiNick4SW. I've seen some cleaning policies on Hotel sites as you say, but when I look at condos I don't really see Covid mentions. Not planning travel anytime soon, but just wondering if others had insights in choosing a place that considers the new travel concerns re: room cleaning policies."
"Claudio, both Airbnb and vrbo have policies. But will they be followed? How would the condos be checked and truly confirmed?I'd trust a bigger company or a local agency more.SWEdited: 12:35 am, June 19, 2020 "
Hawaii vacation rentals are shut down for the most part. So there is no need for cleaning policies.
"Boulder, just future travel considerations as I think this will be around for a while. I think you are right Akamai.Thanks"
"The agency we've used to look after our condo on Maui is Condominium Rentals Hawaii in Kihei. They've messaged us about sanitizing standards expected of cleaners, including elimination of quilts/comforters and the use of 3-sheet bed-making (encloses a blanket that isn't laundered after every guest). They are not accepting reservations until after July 31."
"Look at individual hotel websites. I've seen info about cleaning on several.This isn't really much of an issue in Hawaii at the moment. On the mainland, many establishments are dealing with it more from an employee protection standpoint, in that housekeeping won't set foot in your room once you are there. The room won't be cleaned again until you leave. If you need fresh supplies, they will leave them outside your door."
"Travelers with a major worry about this issue will probably bring cleansers with them.Even pre-Covid, there were travelers who always brought bleach or alcohol wipes with them to clean heavily handled items, such as remotes, light switches, etc."
"Sw thanks.ChiSue, good to hear. Do you have the name of the agency as it must represent a group of condos?Flowerlover, thanks good info.Thanks to everyone. It does look like I need to piece together info from each place and maybe even wait it out longer."
"Claudio, you're welcome. If you are trying to find agency policies, for good agencies I would check: Quam, Vacation Maui Rentals, (used to be Whalers Realty), KBM, and Maui Resort Rentals to start (these are on the West side). These all manage a large number of condos in a variety of complexes/resorts.Edited: 1:54 pm, June 19, 2020 "
SW - Thanks!
"Glad to help! For the south side, I would trust Destination Resorts/Residences. Excellent company, with condos and houses both."
SW - you are a wealth of info. Thank you

I doubt tourists are interested in household cleaning procedures. The hotels will meet the standards set forth through their corporate offices and/ or from the CDC.Advertising on Trip Advisor is strictly prohibited.
"Contact the booking company that represents the condo that you are looking at and ask them to provide you details about their cleaning procedures. The company that reps our condo (one of the companies mentioned upthread and pretty easy to find via searching) revamped its cleaning procedures since the pandemic hit to try to improve guest trust in their processes; I imagine many are doing the same, but you will need to get that info and then compare it with WHO/CDC/other reputable guidelines."
"Thanks to everyone for the info. I can see that for rental condos I will need to check individually on their cleaning policies. At this point, I think hotel cleaning will be more standardized for our comfort level."
"Was thinking about this and thought, maybe it would be better to stay in a place that was cleaned once carefully rather than in a place that was cleaned daily by several different people during my stay We have stayed in hotels which have had very shoddy housekeeping services. This is just my thought."
"Well, the other side is the American love of lawsuits. Who has more to lose, an owner of one condo or a major corporation? It isn't the former.That's why airlines, large stores, companies, hotels, etc. are being very noisy about *what* they are doing. They can lessen their exposure by being very public and also backing it up with policies, procedures, and more ""on the ground"".As we saw in the very beginning of this, people were already demanding payments from some big hotels, claiming they ""caught"" CV-19 at XXX Resort or YYY Resort. There were quite a few posters even here on little old TA.Lawsuits will be essentially frivolous, but for a large corp, it's cheaper to throw the person 10K, to go away. And bingo, next vacation now paid for!"
