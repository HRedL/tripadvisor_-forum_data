"I have read that you can get a PCR test for Euro 190 at the airport in Vienna with results in 3-6 hrs . Why don't , for example, USA, Canada and UK airports adopt this facility ? It would surely encourage more healthy ( or who think they are healthy !) ) visitors to book holidays to places like Barbados. If someone tests positive at the airport it is surely better if they can postpone there holiday then and there, rather than being isolated etc in Barbados."
"Canada has already approved a rapid PCR test that could be used at airports or clinics. The results are ready in 45 minutes. As Canby said it will probably be a company rather than government to get this all set up and going then maybe gov't will take over like they did for secutity screening. Yes we now have a problem with people (usually 30s and under) who want to party, go to bars, beach etc and choose not to follow the rules. As expected that pushes our numbers up. Until they mature enough to behave, the gov't will be concentrating on controlling the outbreaks and other issues on its plate. IMO unless they open our borders to certain countries only, like the EU and UK have done, I think the travel advisory will be in place for a while yet. I can not see them opening the border with the US before they get things under control down there and bring their numbers down."
"You make an excellent point Canby - I wonder how accurate it is? Have you heard that some fast tests throw up an excessive (and inaccurate) number of positives (or was it negatives, I can't remember, sorry!). I saw this mentioned somewhere but of course like everything, we just do not know and the authorities hide the facts from us routinely and will not release the science or accurate info. The issue of course is not what we think of as tourists but people who 'have' to travel. For example, your High Commissioner to Barbados was on one of the recent flights to Barbados, along with 40 other Canadian government people and Barbados govt officials as well. Plus people working for Canadian businesses were on the flight - there were only a tiny number of what we actually think of as 'tourists' and of course returning nationals. So 'international no travel' does not mean what one might think it means - it means travel just for government people and business people and 'no travel' means 'no travel for the mere hoi polloi'... And as we know from the number of cases brought in on recent flights from Canada, it's not just tourists that have Covid! Alas it is the vital people we need here, who are increasingly being restricted, who bring the real money onto the island and spend, not government people!Almost all of my clients now are government and business - 6 months ago it was completely the reverse."
"@ NCThe Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is announcing that as of July 31, 2020, at 12:01 am PDT stricter rules and additional entry conditions will be imposed on travellers transiting through Canada to Alaska for a non-discretionary purpose. These measures are put in place to further reduce the risk of introduction of COVID-19 cases and to minimize the amount of time that in-transit travellers are in Canada.More specifically, in-transit foreign nationals:must enter Canada at one of the five identified CBSA ports of entry In-transit travellers will be issued a vehicle “hang tag” to be attached to their rear view mirror for the duration of their trip to or from Alaska to support compliance while they are in Canada. The front of the tag will make it clear that the travellers are transiting and include the date they must depart Canada. The back of the tag will remind travellers to comply with all conditions imposed upon entry and the Quarantine and Emergencies Acts and a list of public health and safety measures to follow.These measures also apply to foreign nationals transiting to the U.S. through Canada from Alaska. However, entry into Canada from Alaska on the northern border is not limited to designated POEs. Additional measures might be imposed at time of entry by a border services officer (BSO).https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-age…Edited: 10:17 am, August 01, 2020 "
"""""""mainly younger people not following social distancing or wearing masks""""""Canby ..... Exactly the same here in the UK Some talk that there may be total closure of of all pubs and bars again ....if for no other reason than to make some people understand the meaning of 2.0 m without a mask or 1.0 m with a mask It would also appear that the police are going to act quickly and suspend the licence of these pus /bars with an outside area that becomes overcrowded and/or where they fail to collect contact details of the customersWhilst desperately inconvenient it might be the best way to remind people that distancing is probably the most important element of controlling the virus and now the behavioural madness Without some strong and direct action the UK could quickly move into the high risk categoryEdited: 10:52 am, August 01, 2020 "
Beachandsea .....As it happens ...... My son recently spent 2+ weeks in Austria on business ... in multiple locationsHe was tested at the airport ...less than 6 hours ....and then every 3 days and or when he moved from A >B ...similarly less than 6 hours It was all very simple and efficient I get more and more angry at the failure of the UK Government to understand the importance of Test Test Test and then do something about it The numbers are improving in terms of capacity ...but it is therefore utterly outrageous that this capacity is not being used EVERY single day As outrageous is the report in today's paper that some care homes are now not testing as regularly as promised due to a faulty batch of test kits ... why cannot they find some replacements from the 'spare ' capacity
The UK government are dealing with idiots who don’t think rules apply to them! You can take the horse to water but you can’t make it drink!
"Aren't all gov'ts dealing with ""idiots"" Joan? Ours certainly is.Joe I think you are referring to a quick test that was being used in the US that had about 80% accuracy. I don't think it is still in use... hopefully not.Yes ASO, finally! Now if they would do something about them using our airports...."
"@NC - what do you suggest we do about those arriving passengers at our airports? --- make them wear a bell, or a sign around their neck stating ""Beware potential Covid 19 carrier""? - LOL"
Lol. I don't know what airline they are using but they do have an ongoing ticket that could be screened. Its up to the gov't to figure out how to control it. As Canby said while they are in the airport they are potentially infecting other people travelling as well as airport staff.
"Thank you all for your comments. It surely would be a God send if a quick, accurate and approved test was available to passengers at the airport of departure - of course those departing would need to arrive early. But better for everyone, including those getting their PCR test before arrival at the airport : so all those on the plane have a negative PCR test result, if no one is allowed on board without one !"
Sadly we have those same types....many in portland and seattle. NYC has alot too. Be safe.
"#9 Canby sorry I wasn't clearer - I read somewhere that the faster tests had tended to throw up a higher percentage of results that were not accurate - I'm not sure whether the reports said they gave more incorrect negatives or positives. And I suggested that this may be yet more inaccurate and partial news but I did read it somewhere. I suppose I just wondered whether you had heard this, or whether indeed anyone else knew this. If these tests are possible then it would solve a lot of problems if they were at Heathrow and Grantley Adams!"
Joe I think you are referring to thishttps:/…Only 80% accuracy producing false negatives.
"Cannot find the reports just now ...but I believe both the UK and Canadian 'rapid' test are over 90% accurate For a number of reasons no test is 100% .....Would be interesting to know the incidence of false positives which of course would prevent you boarding a plane. At least with a rapid test you could repeat it quicklyIMHO however, rapid tests would reduce the chance of an infected person sitting near me Why are Governments / airlines so reluctant to use it ... Heathrow airport wants it !!!"
"Mdp I read an article yesterday where it said Air Canada was working with one of the Canadian companies, Spartan Bioscience, that has developed a rapid test. Their intention is to screen all passengers before boarding and I am sure all their staff. IMO it is only a matter of time before this becomes reality. I also read that there is a test out now that is much like a pregnsncy test, it can be done at home but more importantly it can be done at the airport and the actual cost is only $10.00,"
"Mdp, this is the latest rapid covid PoC test that has been approved in Canada.https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/health…Edited: 8:13 am, August 02, 2020 "
"As it happens .... BBC news reporting that the front pages of The Times, The Daily Mail and The i are highlighting 90 minute tests Will add further information when I have read the reports"
"So .......the UK press this morning is full of reports and reaction to the availability of 90 minute tests Government talking about a whole range of uses and if as reliable as they say this could transform many aspects of our lives ...but especially travel by testing departing and arriving passengers at airportsOne especially important aspect of this test is that it can detect the difference between Covid 19 and 'seasonal flu' ...which could be influential is getting people to take a test if feeling unwellA second critical aspect of the tests is that they do not require scientific experts to operate them, meaning the Government can train lay people to operate as many machines as are needed. The first batch of 450,000 tests will be available from next weekend and will be used to check hospital and care home staff and patients, but there are plans for more than a million tests a day by winterGovernment has so far bought 5000 diagnostic machinesThese rapid test are on top of the promised 500 000 test per day target set by the Government for the end of October Full reports here ....https:/…https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53632043https:/…All I can say is ...At Last !!! ......the Government does finally seemed to have grasped the need to Test Test Test and then use that information to react based on the science and the data This could really be a world beating game changer !!!! .... or maybe a tool to support the wack-a-mole !!!"
