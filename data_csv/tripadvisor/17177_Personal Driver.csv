"Hello World!I hope that you all are staying home, and staying healthy, through this pandemic.In my downtime, I've tackled planning for a late summer romantic getaway, and I am in need of referrals for a personal driver based in Praiano (or close surrounding area) for hire Sep 11-16. We'd prefer a local, private, driver versus through a company. English fluency is NOT required.Thank you! Keep your spirits up, we WILL get through this!"
I would wait awhile as all Italy is still in the middle of a serious coronavirus epidemic before planning anything for late summer.
"Sasha: I have several names and contact details. Will send them to you. Sadly, however, I am also beginning to think even September will not be possible. I would not pay any non refundable deposits at this early date."
"agree with post #1 who knows about border openings for tourism don't pre-book to fare in advance for anything in Italy at this time.Edited: 7:26 pm, April 02, 2020 "
If you understand what their cancellation policy is I see no reason to not pre-book. As long as you can reasonably cancel if needed there is no reason to wait.donna
"personal me I would not book anything to Europe or anywhere world destination travel at this time in advance but that's me, I would wait to see what the situation is in the world."
"We’ve used DriveAmalfi many times for transfers from. Napoli Centrale to Praiano and also back to Napoli Centrale. We also used them for a trip to Paestum as well as getting back to Praiano after a concert in Ravello. I think a couple of his drivers live in Praiano. They’ll have immaculate vehicles, very courteous drivers, and the drivers speak English. driveamalfi@hotmail.com An email to them explaining what you need will get you a quick response and a quote."
"Can you send them my way please? Thanks!Edited: 3:30 am, April 03, 2020 "
Thank you! I will shoot an email.
"I always book drivers in advance but never choose one I have to pre-pay; there are still plenty of those out there. For getting around the Amalfi Coast, the more pleasurable way is via ferry if going to the other villages but Praiano doesn't have ferry access but you could take the little bus over to Positano to get a ferry or you could take a water taxi to Positano - The coastal road is usually a mess of horrendous traffic at that time of year and ferries are faster anyway - BUT, if the Amalfi Coast is happening this year, it will likely not be nearly as packed as usual for high season. Do you need a car from somewhere to reach Praiano? Naples or Salerno?"
I’ve used Benvenuto Limos based in Praiano several times and was really pleased with the service. https://www.benvenutolimos.com/TAB
We used Luca for airport transport as well as day trips. Highly recommend him.http://praianotaxiservice.it/
Take the train from the airport to Termini Station in Rome and from there take the fast train to Naples or Salerno. We always go to Naples. Make a reservation with one of the transfer companies listed and have them meet you at Napoli Centrale station. They will be standing at the end of the platform holding a sign with your name on it. The drive along the coast road has amazing views.
Thank you very much!!
"Contact your hotel or rental agency re a recommendation for a private driver to pick you up at Napoli Centrale station. Otherwise enter “private driver” in the search box on the Praiano or Amalfi Coast forums where you’ll find tons of recommendations. If you are a US passport holder... you do realize Italy is not yet open to non-EU visitors and it’s a longshot that the border will open this year, right?"
Thank you for your reply. I have a cruise that is still sailing in November
"Hi, Could I kindly ask you to send me those names too? :) We are leaving for Amalfi the 6th August. Thank you :)."
