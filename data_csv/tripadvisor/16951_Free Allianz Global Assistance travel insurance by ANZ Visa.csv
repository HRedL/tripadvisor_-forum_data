"Hi, we will be flying to USA in 2 months (early May). We got free free travel insurance from ANZ visa. The insurer is Allianz Global Assistance. Has anyone had experience with Allianz Global Assistance travel insurance? Please share your feedback as Alianz's Google reviews aren't that good. Thanks"
"Download the policy document and read every word carefully. You will be covered for anything that is included in the policy, and for nothing that is excluded.Online reviews are always biassed towards those who think they have had a bad experience. Often they did not read the policy and assumed it would include something that was not covered. People who have their claims paid are not motivated to get online and post a rant.Allianz is a reputable insurance company."
"ive got heaps and heaps of experience. And I have spoken and talked to Allianz at length. Generally it is a very comphrensive insurance. it doesnt have panademic exclusion.However, we have just cancelled our two month dream holiday to Europe which we have been planning for a year. We confirmed our insurance eligibility and got a certificate in november last year.With the coronavirus we contacted Allianz and were advised they would not cover any claims if we cancelled or changed due to fear. We were going to italy last and would face a 14 day isolation on return to nz.BUT this was the worst. They then advised they would not cover coronavirus claims if travel did not commence prior to 28 Feb as coronvirus is a known event and could result in a claim.So if we cancel they wint cover, but if we go they wont cover for coronavirus. thats just criminal.Yes, wr had the ANZ platinum visa and have always used it.The insurer also has an exclusion for government intervention and they advise that the govt put the restriction for the isolation so it is not covered.Our loss of deposits are in the five figures, We booked accommodation, tours, airfares which were non refundable but we thought we were covered by our insurance, I cant believe how they can say they wont cover to cancel, but wont cover if we go. I will be taking them to the insurance ombudsman about it as we booked in June 2019.My GP advised today that most of the insurance polices he has seen have epidemic or panademic exclusions and ours was one of the few that didnt. But it seems nearly all travel insurance have fine print so hey can get out of it.Edited: 2:00 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Poppy, that is criminal - good luck with the ombudsman. I would also complain directly with ANZ, they need to know their insurance is failing ANZ customers."
Poppy ~ my understanding is that your policy is a legal contract between the insured and the insurer. It doesn't make sense what Alianz is saying. Just not right.They need to stick to their policy wording as per when you bought the policy. I'll call them tomorrow let's see what they tell me......?
#4 I would love to hear your outcome. Interestingly today i received another email from Allianz backtracking - i think it was the insurance ombudsman that scared them. but we have cancelled our europe trip. two week self isolation is not something we can plan for.
If you took out insurance BEFORE the known Coronovirus then you should be covered if you contact the virus but NOT if you cancel your trip unless you break a leg or have a death in the family etc
"Greytraveller, sadly that is not correct. I took out insurance with NZ Travel Insurance a partner of Allianz last July for my trip to Europe from April to June this year. I did not read all the pages and. even if I had, I would not have been concerned that it had a paragraph exempting panademics."
Its not beyond possibilities that an Insurancd co collapses under all this. Its not just airlines at risk.
"#8 unlikely. most travel insurance fine print excludes panademics, epidemics, war, government intervention and many many other factors. They collecting premiums and not paying outEdited: 1:57 am, March 06, 2020 "
Poppy~ spoke to Alianz. They won't pay if USA or NZ closed it's borders because of Coranvirus ~ general exclusion 15. For the rest of my questions i am advised they will confirm the outcome at claims time. Which i get it. But just in general bit concerned about the unknown due to Coranvirus. Don't even know if we will be going at this stage. The situation is still evolving in USA.
Im not worried about USA so much. Its only one plane flight from NZ. And they speak english. i sought advice from my GP and if you are worried I suggest you do the same.I would surely be going to the insurance ombudsman if the insurance try to get out at present. Because there are no travel warnings for USA so they cant claim its not covered.
Thanks I am going via Fiji in Fiji Airways. This is my first experience with Alianz. They not that popular for their travel insurance. Just in general before Coranvirus have you had good experience with them? Has Allianz paid any of your previous claims?
"This company does not see an epidemic as a sudden unexpected event!!! They claim an epidemic is a known, expected event and therefore we should all risk our health and take our trips!!! This company is misleading and I encourage everyone NOT to purchase this insurance!!!!!!!"
"further to my previous post our allianz insurance had pandemic and epidemic cover. We had all sorts of problems when we contacted to see if we would be covered and they advised that any travel after 31 january was not covered for covid-19 as it was a known event, but if we choose to cancel then it was our choice so we not covered for that. Even though we had pandemic cover, they advised it was government intervention so didnt cover covid-19. Basically the insurance companies can find something to get out of it with covid-19. We lost five figure sums. Allianz kept asking for more and more information, took me hours and hours for them to decline.It seems the same with most travel insurers. The sad thing is, disruption like covid is the reason we take travel insurance, and they find a reason to decline.I have domestic travel insurance for a tour which was cancelled. Whrn tour was cancelled our domestic insurer initially refused to cover our associated costs of airfares and accommodation. The tour wasnt directly cancelled due to covid, so when insurer declined i disputed it and contacted the ombudsman. Decision was reversed and we were paid out. But this is definitely the exception at present.Edited: 3:20 pm, July 20, 2020 "
