"spring/summer (May 11 - July 4) season at Metropolitan Opera House. They say they are contacting ticket holders.Even if they could have gone ahead with maybe the last half of their season, I suspect they might have had trouble filling seats. Despite the President's claim that everyone wants to go back to work and have a gala reopening of the country, that virus is still going to be around for a while and I imagine many will be reluctant to venture into crowds."
"Aren't all cultural events cancelled by now?The president may want to re-open the country, BUT this is not going to happen until the peak of the epidemic, with infections and deaths having fallen substantially for a sustained period."
"Singapore is experiencing a ""second wave"" of infections after successfully reducing the disease with strict regulations, but then relaxing them. Ballet dancers need constant practice to stay in shape and that is not possible in a apartment without the neighbors screaming. Theater performances of all types may face reluctant audiences."
"The second wave has the capacity to rip through communities just like the first. People, this is a marathon and not a sprint."
"RE #3 My understanding is dancers -- at least dancers with the big companies -- have been doing daily classes via Zoom. There was a story on this in NYT a couple weeks ago. That's not a particularly good substitute for the real thing, and dancing with other dancers, and it is no substitute at all for rehearsing or performing, but is something. Dancer careers are short and many, if not most, of them will be hurt by this.I agree it may be difficult to get people to buy tix until there is a vaccine. The last ballet performance I attended was last week of NYCB'S winter season, around Feb 26. At that time I don't believe there were any reported cases in NY, was still mostly the very bad situation in China, but I remember thinking a couple days ahead if I wanted to put myself in the middle of a crowd of a couple thousand strangers. I did go, but washed hands frequently at intermissions, decided I would move if I was near anyone who seemed sick, etc. However, now, with all that has happened, even if they were performing, I really question whether I would be willing to subject myself to that risk no matter how badly I wanted to see a performance.I think it's interesting new cases in places like Singapore, China etc are attributed to travelers from other countries and can't help wonder what kind of restrictions/border controls countries may impose going forward after flights resume at closer to normal level.And most interesting of all was the reporting in today's NYT on two new, independent, studies that conclude the virus in NYC came from Europe, not China."
"Instead of a the refund ABT offered, we donated same amount to their newly-created dancers relief fund. Here’s how some other dancers are spending their time:https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/06/mi…"
