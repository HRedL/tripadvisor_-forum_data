"In the few days I've been here I've become fairly sceptical about the supposed absence of coronavirus in Laos. I did wonder about this while still in Europe, but from that perspective it seemed it was everywhere anyway. Time ran a story on this the other day, to the effect that the maon concern of government hete (and in Myanmar) is not to upset Big Brother across the northern border. By the number of people wearing masks here in Luang Prabang it seems a fair number of Laotians are sceptical too.I'd be interested to hear the take of others on this.I seem to have developed an unusual dry cough, which may be contributing to my scepticism. Guess i will see how it goes over the next couple of days, and if necessary bail out of my planned trip and get a flight to Thailand :-)"
There are no reported cases of corona virus in Laos. Perhaps the operative word should be “reported“
"My concern about this post is that it implies that there is a distinct possibility of there being corona - and that may well be fake news. Check all info through WHO and you will get the best info available. Let's not destoy a countries tourism income on a ""whim"" or a ""possibility of something."
"I agree with both of you. And it wouldn't stop me coming, or probably many others, given that there have been reported cases in every other country in the region and there are still plenty of (non-Chinese) tourists about, hardly any of whom are wearing masks after a day or two."
"I have not seen any cases traced back to Thailand, Laos or Myanmar so maybe there is very little, one theory is it does not survive so well in hot climates.The UK now has 40 cases.I find this site the best for latest cases: https:/…countries"
Great site. Thank you. Lot of perspective.
"""I seem to have developed an unusual dry cough"" FWIW that is quite common this time of year all over the region with dry dusty hazy season and rising temps. Many people may have what could be called flu-like or common cold symptoms, so perhaps don't let a few coughs and sneezes ring the corona alarm bells."
"Yeah, maybe that! :-) It didn't get any worse over the following 3 or 4 days, so i went on to Vietnam as planned."
How many people have you heard of getting tested? Many locals i know wouldn't bother going to the hospital unless they were severely sick
"Quite a few actually, especially in recent weeks. How many have you heard of?"
Can you give an update of your situation? I'm planning to arrive in Luang Prabang on Mar 24.

Evidence Bob? Surprised at you. Are you aware these are suspects tested and not confirmed cases? It is this sort of random posting that is contributing to people panicking.
"Link removed until data source (re)confirmed.Edited: 12:19 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Thanks for that Bob.
"I am no longer in LPQ. Left on March 7th. Still symptom free, still no cases reported in the entire country."
"Very simple: If you don't test for it or are incapable of testing on your own, then you get no cases. And everyone is happy happy."
"An unhelpful, unintelligent post."
"""If you travel Laos asking about the coronavirus, the most common response is an assured smile: “There’s no coronavirus here.”"" https:/…"
There has been 2 cases confirmed now. Myanmar also has 2 cases.
Potential risk with many returning home. https://forum.thaivisa.com/topic/1155364-ove…
Laos now has 6 reported cases.
7 cases.
"If each major city were able to test for the virus on their own without having to reply on Bangkok for the testing, then number of reported cases could well be ten times the current number."
"Not the best time to travel, anyway until today we have 14 cases, Lao government work really good and he took really serious this situation, Lao people also, we almost lockdown (with only few cases) but better like that so we avoid the spread of this virus. In many villages also Lao people (from the city) cannot enter"

I was just listening to talkback radio and an Australian nurse who has lived in Laos since 2012 working as a nurse and also has an accommodation business in Laos rang in. When asked about the Corona situation there she said ignorance is bliss there and the reported figures are far from reality. On any given day there is a dozen deceased bodies lying out in the full sun at the back of the hospital and the situation is bad. So the low figures and supposedly nil deaths on the Worldometer site are a farce. I suspect many asian countries would also be very sceptical. Low testing numbers = low cases. Laos is only testing about 850 per million population.
"This last post is absolute rubbish. The WHO has confirmed we have had no cases for 5 weeks now. By the way, Australians do not work as nurses in Lao. The Swiss did at the Mother Child Hospital, but that is it."
I am only repeating what this woman working and living in Laos stated. I don't know what she would gain from making her observation up.
"5 minutes of fame. I already told you there are no Australian nurses working here, so if she does work here it is not as a doctor or nurse."
"Rufuscat Fame for what! She has lived in Laos since 2012 running an accommodation property and she called into an on air discussion on the virus situation in other countries. It only took me one minute of internet research to find many Australian programs where doctor's, nurses and all kinds of medical specialists are volunteering in Laos which is most likely her nursing situation. She sounded a highly educated sensible woman in middle age. Hardly someone looking for fame. Regardless of what the virus figures are in Laos, and I hope that it is as good as it sounds as we loved the people of Laos so only wish the best for them but the fact still remains the testing rate is very very low compared to most countries so one would hope it's not a case of low testing = low numbers. For instance a lof of deaths in Indonesia are thought to be undiagnosed and put down to other causes as testing rate there is low per % of population. Anyway I found her very sincere and won't be commenting further. Take care everyone."
"rufuscat is correct. Australia does not have volunteers in hospitals in Lao, except for Fred Hollows foundation. There is NO evidence that there are any more C19 cases. We in Lao have been very lucky because of the quick response by the government and because of the suggestions made by the Chinese task force that came to advise us."
https:/…From a few years ago but certainly an Australian nursing student (one of 50) doing work in Laos. And the same program sent nurses in 2019nineteendegrees.com.au/blog/2019/1/26/griffi…This organisation has volunteer medical professionals from all over the world working at a children's hospital. https://fwab.org/hospitalvolunteers/Im not disputing the accuracy or not of covid-19 case counts but to declare that an Australian could not possibly be a nurse in Laos seems really odd.
"You will note that the nursing student from Griffith did not work in a hospital.You will also note that the LFHC is a childrens' hospital and has nothing to do with Covid19. Also anyone volunteering there volunteers to teach language and pays for the opportunity to do so.Edited: 12:53 am, June 05, 2020 "
"So funny....I know it’s been a while, but I have to laugh about this, RufusCat and SomsaVath !, Several nurses I know personally have worked as volunteers in Lao hospitals, going back many years.... your claims are simply not true."
