"So that's it then, the majority won't be able to go abroad."
Don't worry it won't last forever things are changing day by day.
Reviewed every three week apparently but yes everyone is stuffed while it is in force.If you are OK to not leave your house for two weeks after you return then you will be fine :-o
I'm more worried about the Spain end.It's unmanageable in any event.
"its not a given, it has to be passed by parliament first."
A 14 day quarantine is not that much of a problem when there is virtually nowhere to go and no way of getting there either.
Hopefully this will end at the end of June.
"we have a holiday in croatia in Aug, it has been annouced that Croatia will be open for travel then so if jet2 are still flying i cant see any reason not to go. I really cant see how quarantine for 2 weeks is any different to the last 8 weeks or so, my wife and children didnt leave the house or garden for those first 6 weeks so another 2 weeks after a holiday when we are skint should be easy lol."
I usually feel like I could do with quiet spell immediately after two weeks away.
"Similary spain has no movement between provinces, there will be no great flood of visitors into spanish baggage halls in june, quarantine or not, and even beyond, things no doubt will change but it wont be quick or unrestricted possiblyEdited: 6:06 am, May 22, 2020 "
"I don’t think the quarantine would deter me much as I’m lucky enough to be able to work from home unlike millions of others unfortunately. My concern is me and my wife staying healthy whilst flying. I actually done a dummy run on flight prices last night with easyJet from Liverpool and was pleasantly surprised. 15th June for 13 days, £55 outward £15 return.It’s a changing situation so we’ll have to wait and see but I’ve never been lucky enough to get flights for £70. Good luck everyone."
It's to be announced at 5pm briefing today.Will this kill off some airlines?
"At #12,for me they will survive though will contract substancially, the wider aerospace business from planemakers down to carriers think it will take 3-5 years to reach the level of business pre cv19.Atb steve"
"They said it will be reviewed in 3 weeks, my guess is at that point some countries will be exempt, Spain, Greece and France for a start....unless we have gone back to crap by then!"
"#14 It does depend a lot on how we are doing in the UK. Normally having a dry hot May is a good thing but this time heavy rain would have keep everyone in doors and not at the beach. Before anyone asks I have not been anywhere except shopping and my local park, since it kicked off."
"People as ever seem oblivious to the massive problem spain has had and to an extent still has, a quarter of its entire population in its two biggest cities are on week 12 of lockdown, with varying degrees of relaxtion elsewhere.Spain won't have to import the infection from anywhere."
"Here's link to travel news. Might be something of interest on there.https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/3722…Edited: 11:08 am, May 22, 2020 "
Politics at play here too. If they lift a 14 day quarantine period and then the R level shoots back up they will have to face unbelievable flack. I’m afraid our holidays are way down the agenda at the moment.
The government has just reiterated the fact that essential travel to overseas only and holiday travel is way down the list of priorities...AtbTony..
"If it's to keep the rate down,save lives etc etc.why wait until June 8th.Do it from today like they did closing pubs."
This 14 day rule will be in place until at least October when the virus has gone from Europe.Airlines will not fly with 26 passengers who can afford to isolate for 14 days when they get to Spain and 14 days when they get home. It will have to be a tit for tat agreement and that is not going to happen till Octoberat the earliest.
"Simon, have you just plucked October out of the air or do you have evidence for this?it its not evidence based then its very unhelpful and indeed pointless"
"Gary some countries are letting tourists in their country from June others from July.However the Brits will not be among them as we are operating a 14 day rule for anyone coming inthis country. I study all the stats daily and the graphs on many sites and with the government waiting 3 months to introduce the 14 day rule they not going to do it for a few weeks. They will review it in September so could be October at best maybe even next year.Common sense that it's not going to be a short term measure.Edited: 5:51 pm, May 22, 2020 "
I thought they were reviewing it every 3 weeks?
"the 14 day quarantine is being reviewed in the uk every 3 weeks, there is also talk of air bridges where travel could be allowed between certain countries asap. There is no mention of waiting until Oct before being reviewed."
Works out if there is 3 weeks revision to the end of June. The way the figures are at the moment no country will want us there.Figures will need to improve quite a lot if we want to be able to travel.Lets hope this new test will shine some light as to how many Brits have had coronavirus.
"Yep, dare i say it theres a lot of British arrogence in this quarantineThere was talk of air bridges with countries with a low R level, but lets be honest who would want us coming, as someone once said, the sick man of europe"
"Air Bridge will be set up very soon with UK and Spain, plenty of Brits with connections in Spain and also a big Spanish population in London and then there is the Tourism, without the British it will be a very , very quiet summer for the Holiday resorts."
I cany go seemy daughter in Scotland or she come to England till at least august might be easier meet in brnidorm sooner
Think they'll be some sort of an agreement between Spain and the UK if covid-19 rates are low to create an air bridge with no quarantine rules round about July 20th traditionally the start of the school holidays before then if you can get connecting flights you could fly back to the UK via Dublin
Forgot to add no quarantine rules between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom
"Who in there right mind would strike up an agreement with the UK, with the worst death rate, second only to the USA, probably in the whole world. We have handled this very poor, and will have to suffer the fallout for a long time. Also being hated by other EU countries for brexit, nobody will want us, apart than the money we spend. Forget this year, wouldnt want the hassle."
Can't understand why the Republic of Ireland to the UK loophole hasn't been closed to stop the spread
"Boris had me when he announced many more families will lose loved ones before their time!!,however, listening to lies, inconsistencies, contradictions and family member experience it makes for looking a bit deeper. If get time take a look at the John Hopkins University paper published Sept 2019, Titled preparedness for high impact respiratory pathogen pandemic,might give an insight.For those who follow the science,this makes for a interesting read and gave me a much better understanding.Each and everyones conclusions respected."
"#34I guess they assume most people will not pay for two flights, London to Dublin & Dublin to wherever.I have just looked at Dublin airport and there some flights but only to major cities. New York anyone!Also there is currently no land border in Ireland and the north is part of the UK."
"because there are thousands of people who cross the border for work/school/family everyday between republic of ireland and Northern Ireland, thats not eveb taking into acount cross border trade. There are literally homes and family that straddle the border meaning that if someone goes to their bathroom they would have to quarantine there for 2 weeks before returning to their bed. This is not a joke its a fact. An open border like the one on Ireland cannot be closed, hence the problems created by brexit."
"@ #33 mitchcornwall The UK doesn't have the 2nd worst death *rate* in the world?Sweden overtook Belgium last week as the worst European Country death rate per capita.There's two Countries that don't even get mentioned in the lop sided charts.But broadly, in line with the OP, if there's 2 weeks quarantine upon arrival, restricted holiday with sunbeds that can't be moved, full bars as the capacity is halved, no dancing together etc etc lol, then two further weeks quarantine upon return, then *the majority* won't be able to go.Edited: 8:06 am, May 23, 2020 "
"god help anyone single who is looking to go to benidorm or anywhere on holiday looking to meet a partner or even have a bit of sex, certianly cant do that when social distancing."
I hope the late night 'Ladies' are going to comply with social distancing Gary :-) :-) :-)
"true lol, will be hard for the hugger muggers and pretend prostitute pick pockets to operate which is a positive side effect to all this"
"Mark #38, the UK death rate per capita is worse than Swedens. https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"The UK does have the second worst death rate by country which is a measure commonly used. The per capita rate may be utilised by those who seek to position us more favourably but rarely do they utilise other relevant population measures which would likely expose more worrying comparisons. The really interesting comparisons are not really amongst those that have done badly (e.g. us) but with countries like Ghana and Senegal, who have managed to have fewer than 40 people die from CV with a population of 30 million. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardi…"
I’d forgotten that that was in the same article. You’re not wrong though Jeny. Donald Trump is currently having a sweet wormwood bush grafted onto his wig. Actually that probably makes too much sense for that fella.
"ianjanice @ #43I read it somewhere this week, but didn't read it accurately enough. It's a temporarily highest rate seemingly.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/swe…Buyurun @ # 44Don't be confused by the death *rate* and the death *total* is what I'm pointing out. It stands to reason that a higher populated Country will eventually have a higher death *total* than a smaller Country, obviously. I believe Brazil is now 2nd on the list behind the USA.It could be said that blindly following the death *total* is used by those seeking to paint the worst picture possible. One has to take all of the figures, include density of population, and land mass, and arrive at a conclusion.IMO all European Countries, excepting Germany, are going to be broadly the same when it all unwinds out, all have made mistakes in their respective approaches due to it being a brand new virus that everyone is still learning about."
Mark we are going to be the second worst country affected by this virus and we are currently joint third and will move into third place on Sunday outright. In a couple of weeks we will overtake Spain which will only leave Belgium as top who I cannot see being overtaken.
"No, I’m not confused by the difference between a total and and various methods for measuring a rate. Defining a the ‘relevant’ population is quite hard and geopolitically defined borders is not really that useful in knowing how effective your leadership has been in mitigating our risk. Really speaking the desire not to be worst is politically high but is far less useful that the real politik of how other countries outranked their richer (much richer) peers despite having much reduced resources comparatively. This is the real question that needs asking of our leadership - not whether we are first, second or whatever on the s@@@ list but why we are not first, second or whatever in leading the response to protecting our population and assisting others in helping theirs."
