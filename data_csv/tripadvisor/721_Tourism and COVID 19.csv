"Generally speaking,Barbados has done a brilliant job of restricting the spread of this deadly virus with a mere 75 cases and some 5 deaths.Contrast this with the UK,likely soon to be the epicentre in Europe.https:/…"
Well I for one sincerely hope this reporting by The Sun is incorrect .As they say hindsight is a marvellous gift Fingers crossed for all
"Regrettably, The Sun (for once) may be fairly near the truth ...especially when you add in all the deaths that the UK Government daily figures have conveniently ignoredIt is not all hindsight ...a lot of it is poor planning and failure to learn from experience and taking appropriate adviceThere has to reasons why, as an island state, our death figures are so much worse than other countriesAll I can say is well done Mia and the Government of Barbados ...and to the people as wellEdited: 8:33 am, April 18, 2020 "
"Oh yes, well done Mia and your government. The death rates thankfully remain low but the population are unable to get food without queueing for hours. And many have had to give up!! Yes we had a bit of panic buying right at the start here before lockdown but why is this happening now in Barbados when things were being dealt with calmly by the supermarkets to begin with and then the government shut everything down and introduced a strange alphabet system that is clearly not working.Perhaps they should have looked at how we are doing things in the UK regarding food shopping. And there I do agree with you, “It is not all hindsight ...a lot of it is poor planning and failure to learn from experience and taking appropriate advice”!It’s a very stressful time for everyone and as an ‘extremely vulnerable person’ on the government shielded list (it’s impressive that we even have such a list) I am able to get regular food deliveries and can self-isolate safely.We could pick holes with every government’s strategy if we really wanted to.Edited: 11:18 am, April 18, 2020 "
Its really something that the industry which keeps the island alive can now be essentially seen as importing death. The two countries which Barbados relies on most are having a hard time battling Covid.This really puts the government in a tough position we have had no new cases in two days and one flight could really add 100s of new cases.
"Well done to the Island for doing such an effective job in preventing the spread of this deadly virus.Sadly,your main tourist target is having some serious issues at the present time.https:/…"
"Yes... the Barbados Government has got it wrong on shopping and this has been covered in a number of topics on that particular aspect of their reaction to Covid 19  I feel sure it will listen to the comments and criticism and make changesYes ... the shopping situation in the UK is now good but both the supermarkets and the Government could have acted sooner to restrict panic buying .... just how difficult would it have been on Day 2 to say 'only one item of anything'In respect of this topic I agree with Canby that global agreement on travel conditions would be highly desirable but I suspect impossible to achieve .... as some countries come out of the crisis before others they will want to maximise their tourism potential I am sure that some countries will take a dim view of the fact that the UK is still accepting returning nationals without any testing, monitoring, solation or quarantine The world community has also still to decide on how to deal with the matter of asymptomatic carriers and if required airport testing protocols"
Yes Westie let's hope this continues I would assume if we can keep this up for 2 weeks there will be some easing of restrictions.
"Barbados has dealt with this crisis superbly and Mia's leadership has been praised far and wide.No new cases of infection in three days is remarkable and I am sure the problems in connection with shopping will be addressed shortly.Meanwhile,back in the UK, we continue to have over 100,000 people flying into our Airports without any health checks or quarantine measures in place and are quite out of step with other countries.Shortages of PPE reported daily by frontline workers and no Minister willing to take responsibility for this inexcusable situation.No wonder our death toll continues to escalate.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TM0d8Yzbaxg"
"..#3Although still horrific, the U.K. death figure is less than that of Italy, France and Spain all of whom have a similar population figure as us (60m+).By locking down the island early, Barbados has been saved a high death toll and, hopefully, that will remain the case.Well done to MM and her Government.The U.K. population is x24 times higher than that of Barbados and pro rata that should give us a figure of 120 fatalities but we have had 15,464. We didn’t close our borders swiftly enough (and, in fact, still haven’t).But, this situation is totally unique and all our Governments are (like each one of us) learning as we go along and being influenced by the experiences of those countries ‘a few weeks ahead of us’. Plus the original scientific advice has constantly changed too. There’s lots of things we should have done earlier, but there’s no point dwelling on that now.If Barbados keeps doing what it’s doing then her people should stay safe. ."

More good news , Barbados has two more recoveries , a 7 year old girl and her father . That brings the total amount of recoveries to 17 . .Edited: 7:11 am, April 19, 2020 "
"BB this morning fatality numbers are as follows:Italy 23,227Spain 20.639France 19.323UK 15,464+7500 (yesterday's deaths outside of hospital)so the total is 22,964, higher than Spain or France and very close to Italy's death toll. I know you are busy with putting on your makeup, choosing your ""chiffony"" dresses and ironing your pillow cases but do try to keep up. Would you know why your government only reports deaths in a hospital and does not include deaths outside (community, long term care, nursing homes) to give a total number of deaths from covid as other countries do? You are only 300 deaths less than Italy and yet you have not closed your borders to non citizens!I agree with you that the original line of attack of your government was flawed. To expect herd immunity (60% infected and living) to protect the population while underestimating the lethality, without a vaccine or even knowing if one had immunity after infection (still has not been proven) was totally off base. Yours is the only country I know of that took that approach. It failed. Don't forget to thank Sir Patrick Vallance for that blunder. I'm sure the grieving families will...Yes this is a totally new situation and all governments are learning but they learn by looking at what is happening elsewhere and how it is being handled. Your government chose not to do that. Why?Maybe if your PM had gone to the 5 Cobra meetings in Jan and Feb that he chose to skip, the strategy and outcome in your country would be different. Just my opinion.Oh BB here in Canada natural hair colour is already a common revelation but then our country shutdown before yours even though your was infected before ours... and guess what... our death rate (which includes deaths outside of a hospital where most are now) per capita is less as is our number of infections. It pays to learn form others."
Even with only +/- 287000 people ... that is a brilliant effort by the Bajan people and the GovernmentHow many other countries have had zero for 3 days ???
"Graham, while you're having a ""think"" don't forget about the medical research lab (much like the CDC) located right beside the wet market in Wuhan. Also try to figure out why China didn't alert the WHO and the world back in Nov when the first cases were diagnosed. Also why China ignored and suppressed the warnings of an ophthalmologist (now conveniently dead from corona) in Nov. Lots to think about. China owes the world a lot of answers."
NC .....another report / review today puts the unrecorded Care Home / Community deaths in teh UK at 4000+So VERY difficult to know what the real figure is ... I suspect that is the way the Government would like it and whatever it is it is TOO high with too many necessary deaths BB ... France and Italy and Spain have probably reached their peak ... the UK may not have ..and yes it is horrific that we are still letting visitors arrive without being checked ..JUST UNBELIEVABLE...and reports are that the Border Force staff are trying to buy their own PPE as non is being supplied
"One simple fact being overlooked in all this hindsight criticism is that the UK is very over populated compared to all the other countries mentioned. David Attenborough talking mainly about climate change this morning mentioned what happens in farming when animals have been kept in overcrowded conditions - any virus spread very quickly and with devastating results. That is what has happened with us humans. 70 million in the UK - France is similar but in twice the size, Spain Canada Australia etc all with much more land per capita than UK. Yes UK has made mistakes but mainly through trying different ways of dealing with the problem. One I will agree with the critics - how can anyone arriving in the UK not be tested or quarantined."
"So in the UK they just *guess* at the number of corona deaths outside a hospital? Is there no tracking at all?I agree Mdp, the consensus is that Spain, Italy and France are past their peek in deaths."
"John, does the UK still accept immigrants?"
"Northern, this is going to sound awful, yes, immigrants are still crossing the English channel by the inflatable boatload and are allowed in, no taking of temperatures or any other visible measures."
Interesting Wheela but I meant legally.
"Sorry, Northern, don't know about that!W-D"
"“BB this morning fatality numbers are as follows:Italy 23,227Spain 20.639France 19.323UK 15,464+7500 (yesterday's deaths outside of hospital)so the total is 22,964, higher than Spain or France and very close to Italy's death toll.”Actually Italy and Spain do not regularly include care home deaths in their death rates. They occasionally use samples based on 10% of care homes. So I’m afraid you’ll have to recalculate your figures in order to fit your biased narrative. “Oh BB here in Canada natural hair colour is already a common revelation but then our country shutdown before yours even though your was infected before ours... and guess what... our death rate (which includes deaths outside of a hospital where most are now) per capita is less as is our number of infections. It pays to learn form others.”  This comes across as childishly smug. Look at us doing so much better than you! Actually it’s a global tragedy and making comparisons is pointless especially with countries like the UK and Canada that are so demographically different. Canada has one of the lowest population densities in the world. In the UK, in cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester we live on top of each other and the way the virus spreads is very different. I’ve said this before, we could pick holes in every government strategy, yes even Canada’s! I for one am happy with Professor Chris Witty and Professor Patrick Vallance despite there certainly being questions to be asked. As someone who is on the government shielded list as ‘extremely vulnerable’, I feel safe and I am able to get regular food deliveries. My brother is an ICU consultant who has just recovered from Covid and what he tells me about being at the front line in hospital reassures me on the whole."
I feel UK has reached the peak now with the total for the past week being just above the previous week. At least I hope so. Comparing day to day figures is a pointless exercise - weekly has to be the minimum for comparison.
Agreed John F about weekly figures. There is often a lag after a weekend and then a bounce.
"Thank you Chris, John and Bluespace for your unbiased posts. I am at a loss to understand why some posters want to portray the UK in such a bad way. We will get through this but all this negativity does not help."
"Blue "" cumulative number of deaths among detected cases."" was the definition used by the reference I used. The UK figures were the *only* ones indicated as ""hospital only deaths"".My comment to BB was not meant to be smug, sorry you took it that way. I was trying to show how learning from governments (other than the UK) who were ahead of us in this tragedy paid off. The attitude was in keeping with BB's regarding her hair colour, eyeshadow, dresses, ironing issues.I do agree we can only interpret the numbers that each government wants us to know."

"MDP why do you need official figures to tell you what the weekly comparisons are. Simply add up the daily figures in 7 day blocks.Daily figures are used because it's ""instant news"" which the media loves and politicians love every opportunity to talk to us!"
"Mdp - I am well aware of the ongoing issues regarding PPE. I am married to a frontline NHS employee (not dealing directly with COVID19 - yet) and hear about it on a daily basis. As I said previously, mistakes and errors have been made and will be made. It’s not OK that people die or workers are unprotected. I’m not defending the govt, only saying, in my view, that they doing a remarkable job in what are beyond difficult circumstances. We will get through it. Be positive."

John F Indeed you can make your own comparative calculations.....all I was saying was that AFAIK ... those from ONS are the only figures published weekly and they do include non hospital deaths ...but do not necessarily identify all Covid related deaths Generally the ' numbers' are a mess and not easily comparable

I have been assured by a British friend that the Guardian is a well respected newspaper (being a Canadian I wouldn't know) so I have decided to share this... https://uk.yahoo.com/news/boris-johnson-wron…
"Am I the only one wondering what all these political attacks on the British handling of covid have got to do with Bajan tourism?! It would be nice to think that what is going on in the world at the moment would be making people address their behaviours but this incessant bickering is awful to read and most offputting for people who genuinely care about Barbados and want to hear what is happening. Local posters have continually tried to do this and it forever goes off topic. Please can we try three things, one be kind, two let's stop the British politics, it has no place on a Bajan holiday forum and three keep to the topic of the post. Let's get this forum back to being about Barbados!"
"No you are not the only one uktripfan, just politics again. Hopefully the forum will eventually get back to being about Barbados."
"This particular topic is about travel ...it is clearly titled Tourism and Covid 19 ...if you do not want to read about the Covid 19 aspect of travel / tourism then do not click on this particular TopicWhat is happening in the UK is IMO relevant to when we can travel again and we cannot be blind to or ignore the failings of the UK Government as their actions could well delay UK tourists being accepted into countries that have on the whole got the crisis under control ...such a Barbados, New Zealand Greece and GermanyI desperately want to get back to Barbados - my joint favourite holiday location - so need my Government to make this as easy as possibleTravel will return but maybe not for a long long time and will IMO depend on the status of Covid 19 in the country you are travelling to and from. I can see some countries welcoming tourist from country A but not BA number commentators are suggesting that 'Covid passports' could be required but there is still the issue of asymptomatic carriers to addressHere's hoping"
I agree the discussion does revert to political debate more often than not when not always necessary. Some other forums are not putting up with political debate so maybe the Barbados one should continue along these lines. Just saying......
"I agree Paul's1 and Jackiee19 I think that is a brilliant idea personally. I am not going to get into any more debate about this, my request is obviously falling on deaf ears but MDP I would politely suggest you are on the Barbados forum, we come on here to read updates about Barbados, not to get political statements about the UK. I will say no more apart from to comment on Bajan topics. As an aside people who have had covid are showing very little immunity in some cases so I would think a covid travel passport would be deemed useless because of that. There is still far too much we don't know about covid to even begin to speculate what may happen and when which is another reason for me that makes this awful bickering and atmosphere so unecessary. But if the small handful of you want to continue this and drive members away from the forum, and carry on your debate which by the way seems to make its way into most threads regardless of topic, than so be it!"

"When the topic of immunization was first mentioned some weeks ago on this forum - I speculated that it would likely require a vaccine and then a ""vaccine-type visa"" as was the case after previous epidemics such as small pox, polio, TB etc that occurred (in Canada kids required vaccination certificates to be allowed to commence school etc.) ... It seems unlikely to me that any country that has rid itself of the virus would be willing to let un-vaccinated travelers return but that's just my guess.... we will need to wait and see"
Perhaps this editorial from Barbados Today sets the cautious tone needed. https:/…I like their use of Shakespeare so here is my favourite version of Sonnet 18 by Cara Dillon. May Barbados once again be more lovely. https:/…
"Intersting, thank you for posting flying.Two comments I find very telling...""Daily, as the Best-dos Santos Public Laboratory casts a not very wide net to catch those who are suspected of carrying COVID-19, it has come up empty-handed."" and ""We are concerned that this net has captured all but one-third of one per cent of the total population of this country.""IMO if you don't test... you don't know."
"I agree ASO. So if countries require a vaccination we are looking at 12 months minimum before international travel resumes (if we can believe our leaders). Maybe Barbados will set up a system whereby citizens from certain countries will be allowed in and others not, depending on the concentration of covid cases in the visitor's country... much like some countries did at the beginning of this. Maybe they will require POC testing at the airport before boarding the plane. As I have said in other threads another determining factor will be how many people want to go. I can't see people travelling out of country if they can not buy travel medical insurance to cover covid-19. Actually I can see countries requiring proof of covid coverage before allowing a traveller in. The required 14 day quarantine will have to go. Then there is the cost of visiting Barbados. What will all this do to the economy and in turn the prices?Edited: 9:25 am, April 21, 2020 "
"I can imagine visitors being required to have proof of vaccination prior to being allowed to enter another country NC -but as for covid medical insurance - some foreign country is unlikely to be as concerned about some visitors' ability to pay for covid treatment as they would be about allowing the virus to once again invade their territory. It is the visitor who will be concerned about the cost of medical insurance and the cost of travel, IMHO"

What if people refuse it?Martin Regg CohnBy Martin Regg CohnOntario Politics ColumnistMon., April 20, 2020timer4 min. readThe latest Ontario data, revealed Monday, shows that social distancing has pushed back the surge — for now, for as long as we keep it up.Article continues but I don;t have time to get it copied before it closes on me)But we won’t truly be in the clear until a vaccine saves the day a year or two from now. Or maybe not.What happens if that medical miracle finally arrives and people refuse the shot? The risk of public resistance to a vaccine seems far-fetched — and far off.But a decision point is coming sooner than many imagine — this fall, in fact. It requires us to rethink now how we deal with thoughtlessness in dangerous times.The challenge will come not only from the anti-vaxxers but the apathetic, from those who insist on their individual right to be wrong versus our collective right to life. It already has.Today we have a safe, life-saving vaccine to protect ourselves and spare the elderly — not from the novel coronavirus, but seasonal influenza. And yet many people — including some health-care workers — refuse it every autumn, exposing the most vulnerable among us to pneumonia and death.What’s the relevance of the annual flu shot to a COVID-19 vaccine yet to be discovered?Edited: 1:00 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"Clinical trials commencing this Thursday, with a vaccine developed by Oxford University. Let’s hope this positive news is the start of finding an effective vaccine for this dreadful virus."
"I agree Pauls. There are 3 or 4 companies starting clinical trials in the next two or three weeks and of course Moderna has had their vaccine in clinical trials for month now. There are also some anti-virals such as remdesivir, kaletra and favipiravir showing promise. Let's hope they find that something works soon."
"Lets hope so Pauls1. They have said the vaccine could be ready by September which I can scarcely believe given the general consensus has been 12 to 18 months but my understanding is they are already producing the vaccine at risk (i.e. before they know whether it works) so if it does work, they are ready to go."
"Well said UKtripfan, couldn't agree more."
bluespacesky .... whilst this is great and very positive news ...I don't think it is quite as you suggest On Radio 5 Live after the Government's Daily Briefing the was a vaccine expert who was explaining the approval process .and I believe she was saying 18 - 24 months before testing would complete and a vaccine available to the public I will try and track down the interview to confirm
"<< ""They have said the vaccine could be ready by September which I can scarcely believe given the general consensus has been 12 to 18 months"" >>Perhaps someone saying ""vaccine will be ready by September"" is referring to a vaccine being ready to test. Certainly not ""ready to roll out.""More importantly, a 12-18mo horizon assumes that a COVID-19 vaccine is even possible... which most people seem happy to accept as a fait acompli. I hate to be a Negative Nancy (I prefer the term ""Realist Ray"") but there are a great many viruses that we've been dealing with for decades that have defied every effort at vaccine development. In fact there are noted experts cautioning against assuming we'll get one here. At minimum, there shouldn't be an assumption that development will be fast and easy.As to producing at-risk prior to trial results and regulatory approval, having been involved in more drug launches than I can count over the past thirty years (including vaccines) I can tell you that starting production at-risk is not realistic for a number of reasons. Some medical/scientific and some regulatory:- In addition to determining ""does it work"" in general -- part of the purpose of clinical trials is to determine WHAT DOSE works and HOW it is to be administered (Subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, etc). So you can't produce the vaccine until you know what dose you're producing and which manner of administration, and you don't know these things until you're done testing- Approval also requires submission and review of data relative to potency, purity, stability, etc of the final product. (Shelf life, how must it it be stored, refrigerated, etc) Beyond just the initial approval, manufacturers are often required to submit to the FDA the results of tests for potency, purity, stability, etc for each vaccine lot produced. Obviously you cannot test the potency, purity, stability, etc of the final product until AFTER the clinical trials are concluded, and you know the compound works, at what dose, how it will be administered, packaged, etc. - Part of the approval process in the US includes FDA inspection of manufacturing facilities and monitoring of production, storage, distribution, etc. These inspections/etc must occur PRIOR to commencement of manufacture but AFTER the compound itself has been approved. (I'm not as familiar with UK, NICE, and other regs, but I suspect they are the same or largely similar.)- The above points notwithstanding, it would simply be imprudent to start production at-risk because if you find out at the end of the clinical trial that you need to make even a slight tweak... you've wasted vast amounts of raw material, etc that cannot be repurposed. (And had to undergo their own approval processes prior to production.)Even if the regulatory hurdles were removed/shortened and there was an infinite supply of ready, raw materials, you still can't really go at risk from a medical or scientific standpoint based on the first two points above. Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things, actual production is the easy part. And whatever company comes up with the vaccine will no doubt (by choice or command) contract with any/every possible manufacturer to ensure production goes as quickly as possible. While we want it fast, we can't really afford a ""READY, FIRE, AIM"" situation... which is what rushing and cutting corners during the development, testing, and approval process will almost invariably lead to."
"The interview I saw was with the lead of the Oxford project who stated it was feasible, if everything went well, a vaccine could be ready by the autumn.Apparently the Government have put in £20,000,000 towards the clinical trials.A time for positivity and hope."
"<< ""Clinical trials commencing this Thursday,...a vaccine could be ready by the autumn... the Government have put in £20,000,000 towards the clinical trials."" >>As someone I once worked for used to say ""Nine women can't have a baby in a month.""Some things require a certain amount of time, no matter how many resources are thrown at the process.One of the key things measured in a study of vaccines is the durability of immunogenicity. That is to say ""how long is a vaccinated person actually protected?"" Current guidance for vaccine clinical trials requires a minimum of 6-12 months of follow-up to ascertain even a minimal durability of response. And, as that would be insufficient to detect diminishing response over a reasonable time-frame -- either overall or by subgroup -- you'd still need to follow those patients for some time after the clinical trial to really know if the vaccine actually works.A little back of the envelope math on clinical trial design and data analytics -- and even assuming super-fast regulatory approval and Herculean production efforts -- would suggest that any vaccine that might be ""tested starting Thursday... and ready in the Autumn"" simply can't have been tested in-vivo for longer than about 2-3 months. Accordingly, even after such a clinical trial was completed, no one would have any idea whatsoever if such a vaccine conveyed protection that lasted longer than 2-3 months. Again, I'm hopefully that what anyone saying ""ready by Autumn"" means is ""ready for Phase III clinical trials and not ""ready to roll out.""READY... FIRE... AIM!Edited: 4:08 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"This thread has really gone off piste, it has little to do with Barbados if at all and would be better served somewhere else.Lets talk about why we are here...."
"RJP and mdp, what you say regarding the vaccine makes absolute sense and like I said, I can scarcely believe it but why would the University of Oxford make such outlandish claims? They really gave the impression that they COULD potentially be ready by September. Wishful thinking maybe. Seems like they were already preparing for Disease X and so have a head start. Very interesting article in The Lancet (respected UK medical journal):“Gilbert is understandably cautious when asked to map out a timetable for the trial, but hopes to have vaccinated 500 volunteers by mid-May; this will be followed by an extension of the maximum age of trial volunteers from 55 to 70 years, later moving on to the over-70 age group. Phase 3 expansion is expected to involve 5000 volunteers; results from the earlier trials will be included in the efficacy follow-up. “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020, we have an efficacy result from phase 3 and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine, but these best-case timeframes are highly ambitious and subject to change”, Gilbert says”."
"""Magical thinking"":-0"
"Sunshinebob, ever get the feeling they’re not listening to you?"
"Well - in a way this certainly does relate to tourism in Barbados because until there's a vaccine, many may not return. In fact many may not be going anywhere much at all. We've been going to Barbados almost every November since 2007, but sadly probably not this November. I think it's fantastic that human trials will begin on this particular vaccine on Thursday."
Neither will I Anne - so sorry we will not get together again - No vaccine - no travel for elderly people sadly!xx
"There's always 2021 ASO - it will soon come round! xEdited: 5:43 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"I agree Anne. This thread is about tourism and how covid is going to seriously affect it and the lives in Barbados. The discussion about vaccine and medications is directly about dealing with covid. As things stand now our only hope of getting things back to normal is a vaccine or medications that can control the disease. How can a discussion about that not be about tourism and Barbados?BTW I think RJP's new screen name should be ""Debbie Downer"". LolThanks for keeping some reality in this thread RJP."
OK ... I have found the interview ...mind you RJP has pretty well covered the situation fairly well !!! Not sure how easy it is for anyone to access BBC Sounds but it is herehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000hhf6..and the interview starts at 1 Hr 55 mins into the programmeThe interview was with Professor Beate Kampmann who is the Director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ...so I would guess she knows a thing or two about vaccine developmentIn brief she said .... Phase 1 will start on Thursday with around 500 people Phase 2 will follow providing there are no immediate adverse reactionsPhase 3 will be major undertaking ... involving trials in a country that has a high number of Covid 19 infectionsIncreased production in September would simply allow more people to be brought into the trial ...not for use in the general populationShe said that typically it can take up to 10 years to complete ALL the trial and analysis before a licence can be issued and that the most rapid licence (not for a Covid type virus) that she knew of was 5-6 years That seems at odds with the oft quoted 2 years but maybe she was being a bit cautious !!! but equally we already have some considerable experience of flu vaccines so this must helpIf you really want to delve into vaccines - have a look on their website for ...COVID-19 vaccines to the rescue???So ...good news that we are on the road to a vaccine but it may well be a long road
chrisky ....I think so ... possibly misunderstanding of what the increased production will be used for ...lets hope that somehow it can be sooner than 2 years or more
"""""""Mdp why don’t you mention the 12 million pieces of PPE that did arrive and have been distributed to 141 NHS trusts? You seem determined to only focus on the negative stories.""""""bluespacesky ....

They do report a very mixed situation and except for the care homes an improving situation. There main issue is that it has taken far too long to get to this stageThe sister of one of my oldest friends has died after her daughter working a care home brought home the virus before she knew she was infectious and is now finding it very difficult to live with the situation Hard times out there which is why I get so passionate about this whole issue and it is IMO right to highlight situations that could have been avoided by a different but obvious alternative actionFrom the moment Matt Hancock announced that we were' a low risk' ... I thought we would be in trouble"
"It’s not speculating when you are simply quoting the Lancet or a mainstream British TV channel. (Although a lot about Covid is speculation!). Maybe the media are speculating or have misinterpreted what the University of Oxford has said but they do seem to be giving an overly ambitious and optimistic impression by using terms such as; “ However, a team at the University of Oxford developing a Covid-19 vaccine claim they might be able to have one ready for general use by September.And there are some good reasons to hope the Oxford team's incredible claim is credible.”Or“Their best-case-scenario is to have that work concluded by September and be able to roll out the vaccine for those who need it.” https:/…I don’t actually believe this is feasible given so many other reports to the contrary but it is a positive step especially now that the UK government has given so much funding towards this trial."
Is the media and general public putting too much emphasis on a vaccine which it appears will take a long time to be generally available. What we need is a cure - something to take if we get this virus. That could possibly be discovered and be made readily available in a much shorter time.I may be clutching at straws but I live in hope.
"JohnF ... as well as the huge efforts being put into a vaccine there is also a lot of work being done on antiviral drugs - both new and old - particularly in the USThe main problem with antiviral drugs seems to be the issue of infection transfer .... they do not necessarily stop this - especially with something as potentially aggressive as Covid19...which in terms relief of on our travel lock down could be problemThe advantage of this approach is that the drugs are already licenced for other usesIt is great that in the UK we have at least two ( Oxford and Imperial) groups trying to develop a Covid 19 vaccine along slightly different lines, albeit that both are genetically modifying a common cold virusLets live in hopeEdited: 6:19 am, April 22, 2020 "

Still thinking about Barbados for January 2021 but probably doubtful from the UKI also detected a decisive change yesterday on the communication front. Chris Whitty was given far more prominence and it was more in the style of a number of other countries ( inc Germany , Sweden and NZ) whereby ""an expert"" takes the lead on updating the public ...rather than a politicianThe news he gave was not at all good ( social distancing for a year and beware a second wave) but personally I felt it had more credence than some of the appalling (and sometimes fake) communication given by our politiciansIf the Government is being led by 'expert advice' then perhaps we should hear direct from the experts ...this is how it was done some years ago It is also disgraceful that the discussions and advice from SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) is kept secretHe also cast serious doubts on the rapid availability of a vaccine and a ' Government spokesman' refused to confirm that British people would be given priority use of the vaccine There are also reports that the social distancing in the UK has been better than the modelling predicted / expected ... how long that will last is anybody's guess !!!"

Look at the UK results - on a week to week basis deaths are reducing - we have past the peak within the capability of the NHS.Of course mistakes have been made - but I bet every other country between UK and China have also made mistakes. Hindsight is a wonderful tool for criticising others
People have to consider the fact that most persons disposable income will be impacted by this crisis. More than 30 million in the US are unemployed. I suspect similar record levels of unemployment has taken place in Europe and Canada. While people may be able to travel within a year will most of them have the funds to do so? Will the Caribbean be a safe place to visit with little to no funds coming in this year? So while the immediate management of the crisis is important I think the economic fall out will be the consideration going forward.
"Air Canada says the return of international travel will not happen befor Xmas, and even that is an ambitious timeline. There will be major modifications on planes, I.e. air circulation systems, which will take time. Be prepared for less flights, with less direct flights and higher costs."

mdp I mention about hindsight because I did not read at the outset you spelling out what should be done to contain this virus. Instead you wait until action has been taken before saying it should have been different. Also you say the number of deaths is more than it should have been. How do you know - what is the number your expertise calculates?You really should find other platforms to make political point-scoring.

"As far as pricing... I just checked AC's site for our return tickets next April and the cost is slightly less than last year. So prices haven't gone up yet. I saw a segment on the news last night about a UV machine that they use in hospitals to sterilize the OR and patient rooms, halls etc. An adaptation of that could be used for the plane during the turn around. There will have to be a number of changes but that is up to the airlines to figure out and they will."
"Then early Nov seems unlikely for AC flights to BIM even if there was a ""magical""! safe vaccine already! (should probably cancel ticket)"
"ASO, will you get a refund if you cancel? We’re booked with BA for the end of October and I’ll wait for them to cancel (I hope) so we don’t loose out."
I would wait until much closer to your departure date. No advantage to cancelling this early. Did you book before the advisory was issued?
"ASO. Wait until your Airline cancels because they cannot fly, then you will get your money back. If they are flying normally by then, you know you will come, so as NC advises, wait until much nearer the time or you might well lose your money."
"MDP963 Thank you for your very informative posts and insights into this truly awful predicament. I doubt we will be flying anywhere for many months to come,"
thanks friends - I booked using reward points - however AC said that i if I cancelled prior to June 30 there would be no charges - (I didn;t think there were charges anyway with Aeroplan?)
"ASO when you cancel...""In the case of a refund, you will also see the miles reinstated to your account by signing in to aeroplan.com ""My Account"" section.

It may take between four (4) to six (6) weeks for the refund to appear on your credit card statement."""
So maybe I should get on with it and cancel prior to JUne 30 NC?
"I don't think so because you will get your points back anyway as well as your taxes and fees. There will be a nominal fee when you re-book, around $100. Aeroplan may extend their deadline anyway. Don't worry about what AC says you are dealing with Aeroplan."

"I agree RJP. It is largely out of his hands. ""The Tourism Minister said he expected once overseas markets reopened, Barbados would start to see some business coming its way."" When the countries return to ""normal""/re-open then tourists *may* start to venture out. IMO that is a long way off when you look at the numbers for two of the major suppliers of tourists for Barbados. Each country will have to decide how passengers will be transported safely, where they will be allowed to go (low rates of infection) and how they will be let back into the country safely. Of course Barbados will have to decide what countries they will open their borders to and who will be allowed in. Then there is travel medical insurance that retirees (and others) need. I haven't heard how the insurance companies plan to handle that issue. Retirees make up a large block of tourists in Jan Feb March and many are longer stay not just a week or two. Then on top of all that there is ""disposable income"" to be used for such luxuries as a holiday on Barbados. ""Staycations"" may be the norm for a while."

"Front page report and article in today's Daily Telegraph written by John Holland-Kaye - CEO of LHR airport ......*** He is calling for an international standard for future air travel to be urgently established now .... so that airports and airlines can prepare in advance*** Stresses the importance of getting the infection rate under control and says this could still be 2 - 4 months away***Says that social distancing will not work in aviation ( or any form of public transport). It is not the aircraft - it is the space at airports. He estimates that it would need a queue of around 1 kilometre to load a single jumbo !!!*** He believes the standard should involve medical checks, masks, less contact with staff and fantastic levels of hygiene at airports. Apparently there was a similar 'standard' used in Asia during the SARS outbreakThere now is an unbelievable amount of 'research' being reported and published - it is sometimes difficult to find the time to read it all let alone assess its importance or relevance There is however one common theme developing that is directly relevant to travel - whereby this distance of 6' or 2 mtrs is not as critical as originally thought. So maybe he is correct. Direct contact ( from say sneezing ) or via hard surfaces MAY be more important and if so then masks and disinfectants can be more effectiveStill does not cover the decisions all countries have to make on incoming visitors - and that I believe is where an international standard can be so importantAs far as the UK is concerned we will find out more on Sunday .... but plenty of 'leaks' in the meantime - allowing the Government to gauge public and industry reaction to some of the possibilities Looks as though there is a good chance that golf courses could reopen which is great news for some of us !!!!"
"mdp I understood that one's breath traveled 6'/2m - when one speaks, laughs, etc not just coughing and sneezing - and that masks aid in reducing the distance slightly, so that social distance sounds like a permanent requirement until such time as a reliable vaccine is produced and is mandatory for travelers - (as surely no tourist destination would wish to reintroduce the virus to their country once they have it eliminated)"

Sir Patrick Vallance admits there has been vigorous debate within SAGE but they again do not recommend the use of masks ...yet' Then the PM states that masks MAY be of benefit and the Mayor of London announces that masks may well be compulsory on public transport as part of the easing of the lockdownMany commentators believe this 'fence sitting' is to prevent the public trying to buy up the available suppliesThe debate about 'distancing' is on going but there are more and more questions being asked by 'experts' and researchers as to why we have settled on 6' /2 m . I did read somewhere that some of the evidence is from the 1918 pandemic...????Some are saying that Covid 19 only travels in the larger droplets that do not travel that farSAGE has said that the 2 m rule ""remains appropriate"" but then the Government has asked SAGE to look at it again ( I wonder who and why) and this week SAGE will publish a paper looking in detail at transmission. Apparently it is expected to say that it is far more likely to pick up Covid 19 from surfaces than through droplets in the air Prof Robert Dingwell who sits on the Government's 'New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group' , which feeds into SAGE says it makes sense to reduce the distance rule to 1.5 m as in Germany and AustraliaHe also said he could not trace much actual hard evidence for the 2.0 m rule. He says there is evidence if you are indoors for 15 mins within 1.0 m of someone who has a respiratory infection ....as in a hospital but that this has been lost somewhere along the way Whilst much of this discussion is about people returning to the workplace .... it it also relevant to travel in a confined spacePossibly too many experts !!!!For the UK we will find out more on Sunday"
"Yes mdp, as I understood the ""mask"" issue - Masks are to be worn to protect *Other* people - not to protect oneself - other peoples' masks help to protect me- Not my own! Only the N95 or better would protect me from other peoples's breath as I understood the epidemiologists explaining it here in Ontario...."
ASO ... that is good .... two lots of 'experts' agreeing ... that is a tad rare theses days ...in the UK at least
Two bits of interesting travel related Covid news so far today ....Australia and NZ ...two of the countries who have the virus most under control were discussing starting a travel bubble between them. NZ PM Jacinda Ardern even 'attended' an Australian cabinet meetingAfterwards both PMs have committed to a travel zone when it's safe to do so ...but that is some time away Are they being over cautious or just sensible and realistic ...and what chance for other countries ...????Much discussion this morning in the UK about the trial launch of a Covid tracing App . One aspect of it was supposed to help with knowledge about individuals for travel purposes ... but then the Government bowed to pressure from the NHS to centralise and control everything in house via the NHSX designed AppGreat concern and debate from a number of so called experts as to how effective /useful this will be in many practical aspects ...but just on the travel front the UK version will not interact with the Google /Apple version being used by many other countries ...so no help if we want to travel
It now seems we are well ahead of Europe.https:/…

As well as possibly restricting our travel plans by having to isolate on our return for 14 days it now looks as though it could also restrict our outbound travelFrench President Macron has apparently threatened that if the UK does this to people entering the UK then France will do the same to those entering from the UK even though it may have been relaxed for other countriesReports that Boris has agreed to exclude the French as already proposed for those coming from Eire ..... BUT it would then open the doors for any country in Europe that at the time has open borders I suspect this idea has just been 'put out there' to gauge reaction .... if more countries 'retaliate' then maybe Boris will reconsider the detailsTravel to most countries is still VERY restricted .... so returning to the UK at present may not be a big issue - as we will find it difficult enough to leave
mdp - There are very strict conditions to comply with before entering France from the UK. Certainly not tourists or people with second homes or to visit families. It has been the case for weeks.
I agree that it’s all a bit up in the air and he’s putting feelers out to see what the reaction is.

"MDP how do you drive to Majorca?It looks like France will allow visitors from other EU countries (including UK) later this month and UK is looking at easing travel from 1st June. On that basis it appears we will be able to travel to and from France ( and therefore into the EU) . However, France will have a 100km limit on how far you can travel.We are anxious to get to our holiday home in Northern France which is a far safer location being in the middle of 5 acres instead of residing on a housing estate."
Not being British so not my place to comment - but I heard a report on Can. news last night that the British PM will table? a 50 page report in the House of Commons today and that is where the details of the proposed Quarantine period will be announced.
"JohnF - until very recently they were talking about not allowing UK visitors until end Octoer, then September and if what you say is correct it's changed again. Macron is making a statement today, certainly they were talking about reviewing the situation again in June, depending on infection rates. I hope you are able to get to your place in Northern France. As long as you are in a green zone you will in fact be able to travel 100 kms from your place as the crow flies, not road mileage. Sorry, I know this is not Barbados travel rated."
"Think we can largely forget any travel to Barbados from the UK this year,judging by these latest comments.https:/…"
John ...yes does not look good at all but many counties are going to be in the same situation...and until the UK sorts out a proper and comprehensive testing along with track and trace ...it is probably not a bad thingThere is also the issue of asymptomatic carriers to deal with and a reliable antibody test to be established
"Now looks as though UK is doing a 'U turn' on proposals to exclude visitors from France in the possible 14 day quarantine ...if introducedSeems as though they did not consider the likelihood of legal action by the EU if the UK did not exclude all EU countries ... more lack of detailed considerationBit odd ...I thought we had left the EU ...but we now may allow in business travellers !!!Edited: 4:57 am, May 15, 2020 "
Still bound by EU dictatorship until the end of the year. But really the UK government should have seen this coming. All these lockdown rules are looking more rediculous each day. As the rules are relaxed you wonder if the new rules could have been there from the start so that businesses could have remained open. JUst been to a garden centre where it is all organised to ensure we stay 2 metres apart. Did they really have to close down for 2 months?

Good link Canby.... Post 181Very informative....
"Thanks Canby, some good points there. I can understand why insurance companies will not want to cover covid if you go to the States but not all countries have expensive health care like the US. IMO the medical coverage should be sold according to the country travelling to. I was told that France offers free medical care to its visitors. Is that true? Are there other countries offering free health care? If Barbados wants to attract visitors maybe it should consider selling us medical coverage for covid only and all the other conditions would be covered by our own insurance. Not all of us will get covid... I think as the analysis continues the chances of contracting the disease, the chance of hospitalization, need of ICU care and ventilators will be determined and insurance companies and possible insurance offered by governments will have actual data to work with."
Are you all sure that you would be charged for care in Barbados if you contract the virus here ? I don't believe the Scottish gentleman who has just returned home was .
Ours too Canby but it is when that advisory is lifted... that is the area of concern. We pay for our insurance monthly (negotiated for all retired teachers) and at the time we signed up all diseases were covered. Now Johnson says they are not covering covid at this time but we have not received a letter alerting us to a change in the contract nor have we received any kind of rebate. We are not looking for that though. We are looking for clear decisions as to what our insurance will cover so we can decide whether to stay with it or not. If we can't travel out of the country because of lack of coverage for covid then we don't need the insurance at all.
"In actual fact, if you needed treatment here, it would most likely be because you contracted it at home before you set off, and of course, if there was a chance of that, you would not fly --------------so all in all, it's unlikely you would need treatment here."
"That is a good point Westie ...which is why, IMO , testing before you fly ...with a POSSIBLE 20 mins response could be the key opening up flightsBeginning to recognise in the UK that a key element to bring the infection rate right down is the detection of those that are asymptomatic carriers ...which of course come down again to mass testing that is accurate and reliable"
"Wouldn't that would depend on the type of testing for the virus which is only accurate for that point in time and if they are also testing for antibodies, both before boarding the plane. Also how the passenger is handled after the testing. It only takes one person (like an ambassador) to be positive and bring the virus to the island. I don't know if she was tested before leaving the US and if she followed the imposed quarantine after arrival. IMO assuming Barbados would be virus free is a big assumption."
"Agree NC - even if all the residents on the island are covid free - some asymptomatic new arrival can bring it back in and then those visitors already there who were covid free may well become infected, and also the Bajans etc ... (I will wait for a vaccine or I will not be back - very sad)"
"NC Of course the Ambassador was in Quarantine on arrival. Government Quarantine is mandatory now. On arrival in Quarantine , she was tested Positive and after being allowed to make an ""escorted "" visit to her mother ( full hazmat suit job , I am guessing ) because she is obviously dieing poor lady , she was immediately taken to Harrison Point for Isolation and treatment if it becomes necessary.  By the time visitors are allowed to come here, I expect the Island to be Covid free, because before that, no one should be allowed in without undergoing quarantine and testing."
"NC ...Re #190 ....Indeed As the WHO said at the very beginning of the European outbreak .... based on the experience of other countries """""" Testing Testing Testing """"""...but of course that will now depend on the reliability and speed of any testing prior to boarding a planeIMHO ...not too many customers will risk social distancing and masks as the only precaution on an aircraftEdited: 1:32 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"As yet I have not tracked down the factual evidence for this ....but I did read the other day that vaccinating someone of is infected but asymptomatic could, understandably, be dangerous ...so it could be that we all have to be tested before vaccination !!! ...???Establishing the numbers of and treating/ seeking out the asymptomatic carriers could well be the biggest challenge to reducing the virus to a minor risk .... it needs a lot of testing"
On the question of medical treatment in France My understanding (not 100% fact) is that medical treatment in France is not automatically free - as a general rule The rules vary according to a number of factors ...one being that your are registered with your home country national health systemEU visitors can reclaim the cost for part of / obtain free treatment via the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - the old E111 which is issued free but must be applied for in advance. Not at all sure if this would cover treatment for Covid 19 !!!Generally the advice is do not travel without health insurance and check with them what is covered by a EHIC
"The reason I asked about France is because I was told by a friend who went to France last summer, got sick and needed health care that it was free. He found out his Visa credit card did not cover him because of his age but there was no bill.Candy I think Barbados requires proof of yellow fever vaccination if you are coming from an infected area as it is. So requiring proof of vaccination for covid will not be new and shouldn't be a problem anyway except for those who can not or will not be vaccinated.So does Harrison's Point have an ICU with vents and ICU staff etc. or are patients transferred to QEH if needed?Canby I think if all the population of Barbados is vaccinated it will depend on supply, if it is mandatory and how much money Mia has."
"Thank goodness Barbados is still respecting the lockdown and appears to have this deadly virus under control unlike the legendary POTUS!!https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/2…Edited: 4:26 am, May 25, 2020 "
"I wonder if another view might be this:In the Uk there are fewer than 1 in 400 with Covid-19 as far as we know and most of them are either in hospital or care homes. The much vaunted testing which is promised may well prove this and also find out the numbers of those with markers for recovery. If the 20 minute tests for both current infection and anti-bodies are accurate the 1 or 2 people who could mathematically arrive to board a given flight with active infections will be easily spotted.Even without a vaccine isn't that a great place to start and open an ""air bridge"" with Barbados as long as provisions for mutuality of pre-boarding testing is guaranteed? I feel that the risks are really low compared to the ""getting hit by a bus"" or other risks we would love to be able to take in normal life. My feeling is, as I think you know, that the insurance companies are happy to insure anything that won't happen and reluctant to actually provide meaningful cover. Perhaps a way to fix this is to only give financial help to those which will cover Covid-19. They are happy to take the government furlough money after all and getting tourists flying again may be the key to keeping airlines viable.Am I really wildly off base here?"
"@Johnfrancis51 Yup lots of places here with large crowds. No social distancing, no masks etc etc. Scary stuff and we will start to see what the consequences will be after a few weeks. Its typically a big three day weekend (Memorial Day) as summer begins here. It looks as though the majority of the large gatherings are the younger ""invincible "" (asymptomatic) age group. How these places allowed so many people to congregate I do not know but I assume that they are areas that have low numbers. Just about 4 weeks away is Independence Day 4th of July. In my part of the country our big events, gatherings have been canceled so far till September. When we have Labor Day which is another big one. At least these summer events are outside so hopefully that helps keep the spread down. I am concerned that when the fall begins and cool weather is here all these summer gatherings will have set us up for a huge 2nd wave. Over our Thanksgiving and Holiday season where we wont be able to gather at all. Wont that be a joyous Holiday season. Also will make it very difficult for our winter travelers with hopes to be able to leave the country for the winter season. We have to get some treatments that work on the table, we have to get that vaccine. Both of which I am not holding my breath."
"""""""Am I really wildly off base here?""""""...not necessarily ...BUT beware there are some on this Forum who really do not like posters dealing with possibilities and hypothetical situations and saying ...'could'IMO ...there is so much going on at present to try and get people travelling again that almost anything is possible over the next month or so Persuading insurance companies to include Covid 19 is a completely different matter ...certainly for some countriesJust one point ...""""""In the UK there are fewer than 1 in 400 with Covid-19""""""...do you mean presently infected...as of this moment ...as a UK average or in specific regions ....it does vary considerably across the UK and at present does not cover asymptomatic carriers"
"Wow!!USA ,led by that obese,big mouth who only a few months ago likened Covid 19 to no more than mild flu,will achieve a very unwelcome statistic of over 100,000 deaths later on today,when only a matter of weeks ago,suggested a maximum number of some 65,000 deaths before the virus burnt out. What wishful thinking!!How much more wrong could he be??This man is plainly a walking disaster.Should have consulted Mia and perhaps followed the Barbados model of disease control."
"NC wrote "" So does Harrison's Point have an ICU with vents and ICU staff etc. or are patients transferred to QEH if needed?"" N C , Harrison's Point has been designed as a state of the art Covid 19 Hospital Isolating and treating  only those with the Virus . Therefore, no one tested as having the virus goes to Q E ,they go straight to Harrison's Point which is mainly manned by Cuban Staff specialising in Respiratory diseases . After this is over, it should be a very welcome additional Hospital on the Island. Those in Quarantine are being kept in various Hotels where they are not allowed out or even away from their room from what I saw. Meals are taken in their rooms. They are people who may have , or have, been in contact with someone who has the virus. They are tested when they arrive in Quarantine, and then again two weeks later, after which they are sent home if they are still testing negative. I hope that answers your question."
"Yes, thank you Westie. Glad to know that Harrison's has ICU facilities. It will be nice to have a medical facility of that level in the north west of the country after all of this covid is over. The quarantine sounds like what we do in Canada for visitors. Canadians can quarantine at home and they are followed up by authorities to make sure they stay at home. There are hefty fines if you break the quarantine. The testing protocol for covid is the same. As of Sunday anyone in Ontario can be tested... symptomatic, asymptomatic or just worried. Unfortunately I was told by Public Health that as of last Wed. antibody testing has not started yet."

"Repeat of my post in the Topic ...Another step closer .......Reports in the UK today that the Government is coming under increasing pressure to drop the universal 14 day quarantine ... both from the whole travel industry and from a cross party group of 45 MPsApparently there is now a majority in Government and the Cabinet who are against universal quarantine'Air bridges' ( or travel corridors) are being pushed by senior ministers in the Dept of Transport and the Treasury and the principle has been endorsed by Public Heath EnglandDfT also working on a number of safe practices for airports - including contactless check in for all airlinesOf course this will not included countries that continue their own quarantine arrangements on arrivalFollowing months of secrecy over the minutes of the SAGE committees - some of them are finally being published - following massive pressure from all quartersThey do highlight what many have suspected - not all UK Government decisions have been according to 'expert advice' ....what a surprise !!!

"It's funny that nobody has brought up the issue of how comfortable tourists will be mixing with other tourists from various COVID-19 affected countries. For example, without prejudice, being from Canada, where we have the virus basically under control, I do not want to see UK or US visitors at the hotel I choose."
"mel - I mentioned ages ago that I did not wish to travel until there is a vaccine - as AIRPORTS will have people from other countries and even if I know I am safe and well, I don;t want to be in lineups with others with whom I have no idea of their nationality/ state of C19 - etc. (as I have a home of my own - hotel accommodation is not my concern - but the airport certainly is.....and neither would I feel safe going to happy hours or dining out) - When everyone has to be certified Covid Free, Then I will look forward to returning asap to Barbados ..."
"Mel-----------------how do you think the staff of the Hotel you choose will think about mixing with anyone from another country ?  It's something that will just have to happen eventually if the world is to get back to normal and people are to earn money, but I really wouldn't envy those type of workers. They will be frontline as much or if not more, than our Supermarket workers who have been doing a wonderful job throughout this Pandemic."
"Mel I don't think Barbados will open its border to countries that do not have covid under control. Mia seems to care and does not want to 9put the economy ahead of safety. Don't forget passengers will be screened before departure so the chances of catching it from a visitor will be much reduced.Edited: 9:42 am, May 30, 2020 "
"thanks Canby ""There are several reasons for the long recovery for air travel, including a change in some people's willingness to fly and apprehension about airports,""that is exactly the cause of my unwillingness to fly at this time."
"The US has extremely high COVID numbers, and for the most part it does not seem to be really well controlled...However, when anyone chooses to travel they will need to accept that potentially they will meet people that may have diseases...and it might not even be COVID19. Airplanes have always been ""petri dishes"", but I think they are much much better currently. Travel involves a risk, and travelers should travel when they feel safe...and there should not be judgement if they do or don't choose to travel.Safe and healthy travels everyone...when you feel ready!"
Well Mel I think your best option for a while will be to stay at home.
"I wonder. I know that several people here have justifiable reservations about travelling, but I think we ought to stop looking at cumulative figures for deaths and concentrate on daily increases and especially the real risk of infection. Here in the UK it is reckoned to be under 1 in a 1000. Deaths and injuries on the roads here are low, but they are a risk of similar magnitude. Though mdp and others will tell me that those risks are elective and not pushed by those without symptoms I still feel safe enough to continue my hospital visits because I think the risk is lower than letting my condition worsen. In the real world doesn't closing down a country for longer than it needs to be harm everyone who lives there? Nobody should be forced to serve in a restaurant or teach in a school, but if nobody does the lock-down becomes a scar which is far harder to heal the longer it lasts. I think Mia can be trusted to open Barbados borders when she feels the balance is right. If we don't feel safe on HEPA filtered flights, standing more than 6 feet apart in airports, or trusting a car hire company to clean things properly we still have a choice. Our money can help both at home and abroad so I am happy - and until my insurance need renewal, covered."
"Isn't that infection rate calculated during the lockdown and with reduced international travel? I agree travel is a choice and no one should be judged on their choice because we don't know all the circumdtances leading to that decision.Flying, does your travel medical insurance cover covid?"
#222 - Yes it does until renewal. I was lucky and got a great company.
Lucky you!
https:/…dexamethasone widely available reduces illness in severely affected cases - so maybe this will encourage insurers to cover C19? - fingers crossed
ASO ... just been listening to Professor Peter Horby from Oxford University - who lead the research on the effects of dexamethasoneOnly helps with those who are most seriously ill - on full ventilation or oxygen support which is now actually quite a small proportion of the total infected. Does not help those who have Covid 19 but do not need breathing support...therefore I doubt it will encourage most insurers ....especially given it still does not help everyone who is that seriously ill
