"The Gov announced new rule today for people arriving at NY airports from states subject to quarantine rules. Have to fill out form with contact details before leaving airport and are subject to $2,000 fine if don't. Some airlines are already doing this. Can also do online, either through airline or on state website"
"I guess he heard all of the people on this board asking about enforcement, right?"
It will be interesting to see if these forms are taken more seriously than the detailed health histories filled out by returning international travelers in mid-March; neither mine (JFK) nor my daughter’s (ORD) were ever collected.
Pretty sure they will be because there was a cluster Rensselaer County that they traced back to some people coming in from Georgia.
"Re #3 Yes, I don't know about NYC, but I have heard of clusters in PA and other parts of northeast that were apparently determined to be due to 4th of July weekend spent in Myrtle Beach, which is either in NC or SC, I can't remember which. However, fact that Mayor said today there has been spike in NYC cases in 20-29 age group suggests some people have been partying somewhere, if not Myrtle Beach."
">>>some people have been partying somewhere<<<That’s exactly it: somewhere. Could be anywhere - East Village, Westchester, Long Island or the Jersey Shore all seem more likely to me than Florida or Georgia. (Do a lot of 20-29 year olds head south in July? I think of that as more a winter or spring break thing.)I’m not disputing that nonessential travel to/from places with a raging outbreak is ill-advised, and I don’t pretend to know what the answer is. But I continue to think the growing, inconsistent patchwork of quarantine requirements is a lot of theater for minimal health benefit."
"Well the catalyst for this change was in fact people coming from Georgia being linked to the clusters. It stands to reason when you have a state like Florida which is putting up the highest daily new covid case count of any state, or other country for that matter, at any point of the pandemic and who are still open that people coming from that environment are likely to be more of a risk than people from here where the case count is under control and we have more restrictions in place and better social distancing/mask compliance than some other parts of the country. If it reduces non-essential travel into the state from high COVID states then its a positive impact."
"What I believe they did in UK and possibly other countries was tell people they simply couldn't travel more than ""x"" miles from home, and that might be a decent alternative to state quarantine rules, but it requires a national policy, which we don't have in US, and even if we did it might not work since Americans don't like being told things like that."
There are alot of people who want to travel and dont seem to care about the pandemic. I am in various travel FB groups and people are discussing US road trips in one group and European travel in another (Mostly Whining about why they cant go to Europe)
"""What I believe they did in UK and possibly other countries was tell people they simply couldn't travel more than ""x"" miles from home, and that might be a decent alternative to state quarantine rules, but it requires a national policy, which we don't have in US, and even if we did it might not work since Americans don't like being told things like that.""Yes, that would be preferable, but in the absence of a functional federal government, state-by-state quarantines are the best we can hope for."
"Re #8 I happened to somehow stumble on a Twitter thread yesterday that seemed to involve mostly restaurateurs and innkeepers in Ireland, esp Western Ireland. The OP was in a quandary because a group of ""Texans"" had shown up in his restaurant in Galway and his employees were upset and didn't know if they should serve them. He didn't know how to tell if they were ""legal,"" -- that is whether they were Irish residents or diplomats or part of some other group exempt from current Irish rules, or maybe had just satisfied Ireland's 14 day quarantine. Several people said they had encountered similar situations. One owner said he just went over to the group in question, asked them if they had satisfied the quarantine rule, then asked them to leave when they said they had not. Another said he/she asked to see boarding passes showing date of entry into Ireland. Yet another said he/she didn't accept bookings from, or seat, anyone with a suspect accent.Poor Ireland. Sounds like because of their slightly less severe entry rules they are getting stuck with a lot of Americans who simply must travel, but can't get into Provence, Tuscany, etc."
"I started reading a lot of other TA forums back in March. Lots of people looking to travel, many people upset with the Hawaii quarantine, which has real teeth to it, one poster from California related how he has had posters tell him they hope his house or town burns in a wildfire because campgrounds are closed and the residents don’t want tourists, and there is one poster who is going ahead with a trip to San Diego that she would personally prefer to cancel because her 4 and 7 year old want to go ( yes, she was getting flamed). We have a quarantine in Chicago, but it has no teeth. I personally have a friend who just drove back from his second home in the Villages and I know for a fact he is not quarantining. New Zealand takes returnees to a guarded hotel. As an island, they can do that."
"New Zealand has also had some problems. They let a couple of women (New Zealanders returning from UK) out of quarantine for alleged ""compassionate"" reasons (""dying relative"") without first testing them, the women later got sick and tested positive, and they had to track down 200 or 300 people they came into contact with while driving from Auckland to Wellington. I think there were other issues with whoever was running this program (e.g., letting people have birthday parties with guests from outside) so when these problems happened their PM cracked down, did away with all ""compassionate"" release, started putting people in hotels in more remote areas, and called in the army or some other military group to run things. I have relatives in NZ and what was described to me during their lockdown sounded more severe than our version; as in England, I think they were restricted in how far from home they could travel. Also, not only are they an island nation, they are a small nation -- population of only 4 or 5 million. So is feasible to put people into forced quarantine paid for by govt (though have heard they are thinking of making""guests"" pay for it) since they are mostly New Zealanders -- stragglers who didn't return home when first told to and even now, with increasing numbers returning, I think it's no more than a couple thousand in hotels. NZ also has a respected PM and a national policy for dealing with coronavirus, which we of course lack."
"We had returnees in 'quarantine hotels' here in Melbourne. Subcontracting, insufficient training, lack of PPE, stupidity (security guard does not need training to know not to have sex with a returnee)...then security guards going home to their families/house mates and spreading the virus...We have had triple figure new cases here for over a week. I've looked at NYC current figures and they seem comparable. The Chief Health Officer has said most, and maybe ALL, new cases are because of what happened at the quarantine hotels. Here in Melbourne we've gone into Lockdown 2.0; we can go out for work/study, essentials, exercise (in the neighborhood) and care....and people are still having parties and trying to escape from the lock down zone. BIG FINES.Even in the few weeks between Lockdown 1..0 and 2.0 the idea of eating in a restaurant (allowed) frightened the bejesus out of me....and I live alone...hooray for the internet, the radio, the phone, zoom, facetime and LMM for Hamilton....I eat at home (supermarkets and other food shops are all open, cafes and restaurants have been doing take away throughout). I wore a mask for the first time on Sunday. Glasses fogged up constantly. Had to carry my glass cleaning cloth to wipe the glasses down regularly. I took my glasses off. Couldn't decide if fuzzy or foggy was better...STAY SAFE.Edited: 10:55 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Well good luck with the glasses, Jenny. I also have glasses and the same problem, and that is one reason why I often pull my mask below my nose when outside and not near people. Nonetheless, even without fogged glasses I am still often blinded by the sweat streaming into my eyes at this time of year on account of the heat and humidity.Sometimes I wonder how my late mother (and father) coped with 2 children during the polio years. Wish she were still alive so I could ask her. All I can recall is not being allowed to go to the movies or other indoor activities involving strangers during the summer. But the beach and playing outside were okay. School was normal. There must have been other preventive measures, but as a small child I wasn't aware of them. One thing I definitely don't recall is people whining and carrying on about hoaxes and loss of personal liberties, etc. (though believe we had neighbors who still complained Roosevelt was a Socialist, or worse, even though he had been dead for years). When the vaccine became available it was arranged for everyone to just go down to the town green and line up and get the first shot there, most likely administered by the town health dept.,and I can still remember both the line and the heat of the summer night. I don't even want to think about the battles we will face when a COVID vaccine is available -- was just listening to the science editor of the Atlantic suggesting we ain't seen nothin yet in terms of failure of national planning and COVID battles -- the vaccine will be the big one, he suggests.Edited: 11:53 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Jenny R, we really had it in control had it not been for this quarantine hotel debacle. Such a shame. I’ve noticed more cars on the road this time around then the first stage 3 lockdown."
"Jenny, masks with a little nose wire help with the fogging -some people have taken a paper clip and inserted it to make their own, or used medical tape. I have a few masks with the wire, so haven’t tried those remedies yet. Also people report that washing your glasses with dish soap first will also help prevent fogging. You may need to try several masks to find one that works well for you. Yes from what I read in their forum at the time, the NZ lockdown was much more stringent than ours. I think in France you were also limited in how far and for how long you could leave your home, and you had to carry a pass where you entered things like the time you left."
"<> I know Kat, there were even 2 days (non-contiguous) when we had NO new cases in the first week of June.Thanks for all the tips about anti-fogging my glasses. I will perservere, tho' I did make a visit to the supermarket very early this morning and did a big shop so I don't think I need to go outside for another fortnight - so that leaves just 3 more weeks of Lockdown 2.0....which I think is a bloody good idea.For a little light relief, look up Brett Sutton's instagram - he's our State's Chief Health Officer - and has a great coffee mug on his desk.QQ2, my grandmother got polo as a young mum. After she left the infectious diseases hospital, she was in a wheel chair for the rest of her lift - great gardener, sewer and cook. I remember as a kid lining up for that pink gooey teaspoon of polio vaccine and being very grateful that it existed."
"I have masks with the little nose wire and they do little for me. Nor does taking the time to soap them up or tuck them under my glasses or various other home remedies that have been suggested. They may work for others but either don't work for me or just don't seem worth the effort. But I am generally okay with the fogging, can usually tolerate it for as long as is required. Frankly, I hate summer heat and humidity a lot more than I hate face masks."
"There is an Episcopal church here in NY that I believe still has the ramp it acquired when a young Franklin Roosevelt and his wife were parishioners. At some point in the not too distant past, like 15 or 20 yrs ago, they were still using it when a ramp was required. Don't know if they still are. Church of the Incarnation, in Murray Hill at Madison & E 35."

"I wear glasses as well so I really sympathize with all of you!I have found that the actual mask had a lot to do with the amount of fogging that occurred, especially:- the quality of the nose wire (it HAS to be made of material that will maintain it’s shape after you bend it to fit firmly around/on the bridge of your nose and against your cheeks)-the breathability of the material used in making the maskBefore I found the masks that worked best for me, I did try the simple hack demonstrated in this YouTube video (4:22 long) https://youtu.be/IrYFvE_mCU4 , and it did help. Having said that, I’m much happier with the current (disposable) masks that I’m using, so hopefully you too will find the one that works for you!"
"I’m not fond of the disposables, I think it’s the material. It seems to irritate me."
"I had an eye appointment last week and kept fogging up the thing you look through to read the chart. Apparently other people have had the same problem as my eye doctor had something handy to wipe off the glass.Warriorjan: sounds like we've been reading the same forums. If you want to read more complaining, take a look through my state's various forums."
your experience at the optometrist made me laugh CB48.My masks do have a wire at the top. I'll try harder to tuck it under the glasses and pinch the wire to shape. Thanks for the video Delta....will look later today. But like I said I don't need to go out for a while.
"#23I generally am not fond of disposables either, especially when I stop and think about the impact of all the “garbage” being generated during this epidemic.The disposable masks that I have been using recently were given to me in a ziplock bag, 20 in total, after I complained to someone I know about the problem I was having with my glasses fogging up, and not being able to find a good comfortable mask, even after ordering a number of cloth masks from different providers online. These particular disposable masks are graded at a higher level compared to the ones sold to the public in pharmacies, local shops, online, etc.Unfortunately, I don’t know who the manufacturer is, or if I will be able to get more, but they have made all the difference for me when I have to go out on my weekly errands: I can put the mask on at home, adjust it, hop in my car, make multiple stops, breath VERY comfortably, see through my glasses, and—a bonus—leave the mask on until I get home to wash my hands with soap and water before removing it!I had no idea that there are masks out there that are this comfortable, but it makes sense because health care workers have to wear masks all day and there’s no way they can do their jobs while wearing the same quality masks that are easily available to the public (most of them would apparently not be approved for use by health care workers). Honestly, when I think about all the people who resist wearing masks, I wonder how many of them would be more compliant if they tried a mask similar to the ones I have been using for the last month. I now have a pile of costly cloth masks at home that I hope I never have to wear again, but I’m holding onto them, just in case, as Toronto now has a by-law requiring a mask or face covering in all indoor public spaces.Edit: I hope you all find a good solution for your mask woes; I think this will be our way of life for a long time!Edited: 8:56 pm, July 14, 2020 "

"Delta, my solution is stay at home! At least for LOCKDOWN 2.0."
"Like others I know, I wear the mask purely to blend in and because I'm required to in many situations, not because I believe in any of it. Compliance is not an indicator of acceptance."
Fair enough. This guy didn’t believe in any of it either https:/…30-year-old-dies-covid-party-texas
"#28 But I wish people would just stay in their own homes in their own towns or cities. I had heard of people coming to NYC to avoid plague in their own states or have access to better medical care than in own states -- and also of locals going down south and bringing elderly retired parents back for same reasons -- but today I think I may have seen a couple cases of it with my own eyes. Was in ATM today when guy came in after me. He was on phone and shouted ""Y'all wear masks up here? Where can I get me a good N95?"" If there's one thing I can't stand in ATM lobbies it's people speaking loudly on phones. But when I realize I may soon be competing with them for masks, not to mention toilet paper and doctors, well that's a bit much for me.Right before I got to the ATM I saw a middle-aged couple in short shorts and flip flips, dangling masks from their wrists, who I thought could have been from somewhere way down south, based on attire and mannerisms."
"I’m not sure masks dangling from wrists is the tell you think it is, QQ2. Since you first mentioned this, I’ve seen a number of people who were almost certainly New Yorkers (tradesman with jangly keys, wearing the shirt of an elevator repair company, on the subway in Manhattan; Orthodox woman speed-walking in Prospect Park; woman in a wheelchair by the Gowanus) not-wearing their masks that way. And New Yorkers speak with lots of different accents.I’m not in Manhattan much, but I made a foray to midtown today and had to kill quite a bit of time in Bryant Park while waiting to pick my husband up from a medical procedure (since the waiting room was closed). It was very, very quiet, and I saw maybe 2 people who seemed like maybe-tourists in that hard-to-define way. So I don’t get the impression that we’re being overrun (though I acknowledge that you live in a much more tourist-dense area than I do). And I think some compassion for the difficult positions people find themselves in in this pandemic is in order - young people losing jobs and needing to move, people wanting to have older relatives close, etc. If I had a bigger place, I might be thinking seriously about trying to get my mom to come here (even though she’d make me crazy). Bottom line: I’m just not a pull-up-the-drawbridge kind of person, which is why these state quarantines continue to bother me (plus the fact that they strike me as ineffective)."
"I kinda doubt there are a lot of people moving to NYC. In these economic times I doubt that most people are willing to increase their cost of living. I'm much more concerned about people looking to take a non-essential vacation dragging more of the virus in here. Upstate New York and new england and other areas outside the cities are the places probably most likely worried about migration. Staying in NYC is a gamble if we get hit with a bad second wave, so I don't suspect we will see an influx of people moving here until the virus is under control for good."
"Most of the New Yorkers I see not wearing masks outdoors are, like me, wearing them pulled down from nose, or possibly both nose and mouth, but still usually around neck and ready to pull up if need be, not dangling from wrist in a theme park sort of way.There is a certain fashion ""look"" I rarely see here in anyone over 25 and rarely in guys -- little short shorts over tight little butt, little polo shirt over toned chest, little flip flops, cute little walk. The only place I have seen that look in the 40-50 yr old range is in Florida. Maybe it exists in other places, maybe they were a couple in from Kew Gardens or Wayne for a medical procedure, but the first thing I thought of when I saw them was Florida because, in my personal experience, that is a memorable look I have seen in that age group only in Florida."
"Frankly, I am very concerned about tourists. There’s talk of the National Park Service opening up SoL and EI. But it’s subject to the governor, fortunately -I hope he errs on safety rather than business interests. We do have limited resources now. And the disdain for masks is growing. Tourists make it harder. I had to go to Bergen County for a business meeting yesterday. One of the people at the meeting went off on how we don’t need masks anymore. That no one is dying anymore. This happened not five minutes after speaking to a college student I mentor who is dealing w the next steps w his Father, what kind of palliative care to give him. I almost burst out in tears. More and more restaurants are opening and there is joy in the air as people are sitting at newly allowed outdoor spaces, jutting out into the streets and avenues. But seating is limited and we are just not ready for more people coming into the city. It’s not safe yet. We need to see how we manage w the people already here (and paying insane taxes).Edited: 6:46 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"#33 I don't think many people are moving here permanently, rather temporarily, for a couple of months until things calm down back home. None of the people I observed today looked exactly poor. There are airbnbs going begging here. Not to mention cheap hotel rooms. The couple I was walking behind turned into a street with both a newish hotel and a newish condo bldg built w/overseas Asian investors in mind and they seem to be mostly doing Airbnb type rentals since they were apparently misled as to how much rent they might get on long term rentals. The hotel was closed a month or two ago but may have reopened. Maybe I should have played sleuth and followed this couple to see where they went!And keep in mind that there are some good deals on sublets as people give up their apartments to move out of NYC.Edited: 6:53 pm, July 15, 2020 "
@36 then those are just glorified tourists.
"#45 Another thing on Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island is boat operator -- they are going to have to be allowed to operate under these conditions and I assume willing to operate with much lighter load.I was recently checking on a couple of sites in Hudson Valley -- FDR site in Hyde Park (NPS) and Olana, in Hudson (state). Both seem to be closed, but with grounds open. I guess NPS is also struggling with how to handle opening of national parks, esp out west."
"""There’s talk of the National Park Service opening up SoL and EI."" Dear god, no."
"""Upstate New York and new england and other areas outside the cities are the places probably most likely worried about migration""Agree and this is not a new concern.QQ2 I hope you had the same level of concern when people from NYC migrated upstate and beyond during the worst of the pandemic in NYS."

I can't imagine being such a fraidy cat (unless perhaps one had a bunch of small kids). To be honest, I have been sorry to see some of them return, especially the ones in my building.

"Yes, I know there are good hospitals upstate. But someone from Florida who has only heard of NY Presbyterian or NYU Langone, and has friends/family who are a 5 or 10 min cab ride away, isn't likely to have heard of them. There is an excellent medical center in Albany, an excellent hospital in Poughkeepsie, another medical center in Rochester, and likely many more, but they aren't widely known outside NY, especially by people who have no connection to those places.Looking to have some people move upstate to fill those hospital beds?"
Yes there are some great hospitals in NYC but there are many more that are very subpar.
"#44 I agree. Some of the lowest ranked hospitals in the country are in the outer boroughs. It's amazing. So if the only choice for someone fleeing Florida is to move in with relatives in the outer boroughs, they might want to reconsider and see if they have any relatives in Albany or Rochester."
#43 -No; looking to have you quit using tired stereotypes about upstate.
"Jenny,Staying at home is my solution as well, and it’s what I do as much as I can. Both my husband and son continue to work from home which means I do have to go out more frequently for groceries, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, because of the increased number of meals now consumed at home. I did try having groceries delivered once, early on, but I found that was more frustrating than it was worth. Toronto now has a bylaw requiring everyone to wear masks in all public indoor spaces so I find that grocery shopping is not as disconcerting as it once was. I am fortunate to live in a house with a private yard so I can get out for some fresh air as often as I like during the day, and the garden helps me fit in some outdoor exercise too. To be honest, I’m really blown away by how most people here have been very cooperative about working together, and doing what needs to be done for the benefit of all. We have had some unfortunate situations arise but they’ve been dealt with swiftly and appropriately, based on what I have seen in media reports after the fact, and behavioural expectations reiterated. It is for the most part a “we” attitude and not a “me” attitude, which yes means a lot of us will just stay home as long as we need to :)"
"We're in VA, which is sort of on the bubble right now for the NY quarantine.

I think it's a case of you can't get there unless you drive through NY.If so, are we allowed to stop and make a purchase in NY state, for example curbside pickup at a brewery? Are we allowed to stop for a meal?"
"""I don't understand why someone from Miami or Palm Beach or Orlando or Ft Myers, possibly with friends or family in NYC, would be considered more likely to temporarily resettle in rural upstate NY than in NYC?

A number of people moved out of the city the first time, so I'm not sure why someone whose whole priority seems to be to avoid the virus would trade one urban area for another urban area where it is difficult to socially distance. A number of people left NYC during the first wave. If your goal is to avoid the virus then chances are you aren't looking to move to another dense urban area. The hospital stuff was already covered about."
"RandallVA, that’s an excellent question that’s not addressed (as far as I can tell) in the state’s travel advisory. It does have provisions for people who pass through quarantine states in transit (no need to quarantine if there less than 24 hrs), but not for people from quarantine states who need to pass through NY."
"#49 Well if I were looking to flee to Florida to avoid a plague (which I'm not), the last place I would be looking to set up camp would be in the Everglades or anywhere else rural.

And if I knew anyone in that area, all the better.I didn't even know people were moving upstate to avoid a second wave in the fall (I just heard an""expert"" on TV say the second wave in NYC isn't going to be in the fall but next month, as cases move up the coast from Florida; they have allegedly already arrived in NY suburbs).Also, I thought all the resentment about the New Yorkers who fled in the spring was about people who fled to 2d homes in the country-- or who quickly rented second homes in the country -- in small communities with limited resources (not many gas pumps, grocery stores, doctors, plus small community hospitals), and locals fearing strain on those resources. I had not known people were also going to upstate cities and bothering people there."
