"Bon Jour,Our family of 4 is staying in the 9th near St. George Metro and we would like some casual places to eat at the end of a busy day of sightseeing. My Google skills have let me down on this search. Breakfast places would be welcomed too!Merci,Sharon"
"Check Le Bon Georges about 40m south of the metro station. Nice bistro food (very nice meat in particular, and a great riz au lait) and good bistro vibe. Bonus points for taking orders up to 23.30, as they are right in the middle of the theater district."
"""Inexpensive"" might be a small challenge in that area... Seanbee, any ideas...? I would suggest le Danube but that has changed hands a few times so not sure what that place is now. You are not far from many choices albeit not dirt cheap. Bon ap, A+"
syp!Can you give us a vague budget?Fab area by the way!
"There's a number of Astotel properties in this area catering to different budgets - lookup www.astotel.com - its a very well-managed chain in Paris. We stayed at the Joyce Astotel, about 5 mins from St George Metro (my review at http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1631156-r267504407-Hotel_Joyce_Astotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) - it was terrific."
"Wish I knew about Le Bon Georges during our recent trip. Looks fabulous!!! I would say that is a superb recommendation. And yes - I agree with SB - great area!There is a plethora of fantastic, well-priced restaurants in a 5-10 minute walk of where you are staying. Check out the dozens of places along Rue des Martyrs.Edited: 5 years ago "
I like Le Caillebotte restaurant tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187147-…
Thanks Inna!Looking for a place for guests up from the boonies .Had forgotten about that one.
"will wait for review, seanie"
Count on me!
"The dinner menu for €35 - €50 is not what I would call an inexpensive & casual meal for a family of four with tired feet heading to bed before dessert but it does look tasty. I remember seeing the place pre-opening getting painted. It is nice to see yet another success story in my old neighbourhood...) Bon ap, SB!Edited: 5 years ago "
Agreed Adven.....but waiting for OP to get back to us!
"For years when I had friend(s) in town I used to have a burger at the sports bar just a few feet next to the OP's hotel and altough it has changed hands since it apparently still is a sports bar and still makes a great €15+ burger. I am surprised they haven't seen it as an option. Back in the day and up the street, le Danube ruled my world with a Tagine for €11... Here is the sports bar knocking at their door: tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187147-…"
€15+ burger???? The lunatics have taken over the asylum.
"I agree Pericoloso, that restaurant is packed with them, me included for not cooking at home, lol: http://www.playoff.fr/les-photos/To be fair for the readers you can walk a little bit away from that neighbourhood and find Chartier that has dinner plates for 8.50 € to 13.50 €, which I have eaten at many times too. The waiting line would have already reached out the alley and on to the streets by the time the question was asked so it didn't make sense to suggest it. However, the cow's head topped with mustard flavoured emulsified egg yolk or the grilled tripe stuffed in colon intestines is to die to for. Chartier menu (notice some customers wearing suit & tie): http://www.bouillon-chartier.com/en/menuHard Rock burgers same price as the PlayOff is around the corner from there but really loud: http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/paris/menu/Zangos (many times there too) would be a hike from there but you can eat plate and glass of wine for €17: www.zango.fr/nos_grandes_assiettes.htmlYou could save a few euros finding one of these Buffalo restaurants (meh): http://www.buffalo-grill.fr/la-carte/burgersSo.. back to my old neighbourhood for €15 burgers or €40 goose liver, pickled turnip & cabbage stuffed quail.If you must, there is a McDonald's at Métro Cadet. And plenty of Asian restos starting with one almost facing PlayOffs at the street corner.Bon ap! Adventure+Edited: 5 years ago "
So glad I am not a carnivore.

"So far there are three suggestions pertaining to the OP's question - casual, inexpensive, for family of 4 tired from a day of sightseeing, somewhere near St.George metro in the 9th:Mine for PlayOff inna for CaillebotteParisix for Bon Georges.For comparing burger prices far away from St George, I agree 5hParis, the French won't recommend McDonald's but they do eat at them. France is the most successful country outside the U.S. for McDonald's since they incorporated. There are 1,200+ locations in an area the size of Texas, including the one for normal French people of Rambouillet that pack both houses of McDo and Buffalo, non-stop. Yes, it could be France's demise but at least it's believed to serve local beef and cheese."
Wasn't it Buffalo grill that was found out to have knowingly served its customers mad cow tainted meat during the hight of the epidemic? How come that had no effect on their popularity?
