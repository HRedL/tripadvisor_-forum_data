"Before anyone yells at me, Yes...I know this topic is like beating a dead horse and everyone asks about it - but im just curious what the deal is.Everyone i know keeps annoying me by telling me NOT TO GO TO CANCUN! What is with everyone. I live in NY and there are drug issues and crime here too - why is everyone freaking out about Mexico? I do know that there are issues in Ciudad Juarez near the El Paso border which is NOT close to Cancun.... but whats the deal IN cancun... nothing major right???Again, sorry if I repeated what other people have said on here, just wanna know if there was any update to this issue.thanks all :-)"
Do a search for Safety and you will find threads which answer your question. Plan your trip and look forward to it.
Search for violence works to find previous posts on this issue.
Thanks Co Pilot - we leave next friday.... Oh and im going!! haha just curious what everyone thinks?
Same here I would love a nickle for every person who has said soemthing about the DANGER. Like you said it is not Cancun and when ever you travel any where you need to be cautious. We are leaving also next Saturday and will be very happy when we get to Cancun!
Its amazing how people make mountains out of mole hills LOL
"you would have thought a couple of my coworkers and clients were working with virtual Evening for the months since I got murdered and/or kidnapped in Mexico City in July.... They all had horror stories (one from the '70s!) for me prior to my Yucatan trip. The Yucatan is amateur compared to DF - and I was walking around alone there at night! meanwhile, these clients are in Ohio - the meth capital of America!"
"Omg..we went in Feb. and my sister is STILL harassing me about going. She sends me links to news stories. When I point out it was nowhere near Cancun she just has that tsk tsk look. Needless to say, I will be going again next winter. Down with Haters! "
HAHAH! Thanks everyone! Just making sure I'm not the ONLY one getting harrassed from friends fanmily. 
"I love this topic. Nothing like worrying about the $2500 I spent about a week before Mexico became newsworthy. We just say, we booked a no refund trip. Who gives a s#$% Enjoy your trip. "
:-) hehehee thanks everyone! 
"I will repeat my unselfish offer to go in place of anyone concerned about their safety. Just give me the hotel and I will get air transportation. Free airfare would be nice if we can make that work.Note that I will spend plenty of time trying to talk you out of giving me the trip since I believe that it is safe and that you will have a great time. You should go and ignore the uninformed concerns of people who just listen to news soundbites. But if all that fails, throw me in that briar patch."
I just remind my co workers of the incidence of crimes going up in our own neighborhood related to drugs and ask if I should move out of this pleasant little town?
A friend backed out of our trip after her family told her about stories they'd heard. Meanwhile she lives in the Bronx (any New Yorkers in the house?)& someone had just been shot by an ARROW not far from where she lives!Two more level-headed people are taking her place.Tra
im now very scared that i'll be the only one in cancun in may because everybody else was to afraid to 
sorry missed the go off see very nervous
Make sure you also let everyone know that there is a terrible respiratory disease going around too. Maybe enough people will stay home and I will be able to get a chair in the shade without waking up at 5am. 
"We started with a group of 10 going and were now down to 6 because of the lovely friends and family who continue to tell us how unsafe it is! I had my concerns at first too, but as I read howm any are returning home each day still with their heads and wonderful tans I decided there wasn't anyway i was skipping this year!"
"I dont mean to joke about the respiratory infection that's going around (especially since I've had laryngitis since Sunday - and got back less than a month ago!), but it is pretty funny that as usual, people are worrying about the wrong thing! All this dithering about security, when the respiratory thing is a lot more likely. "
Yes. It seems like a flu of some sort. Right now it is in South/Central Mexico and not really in the Yuctan quite yet. I am sure people are getting sick but it is not an epidemic. 
"Just got back yesterday from yet another awesome trip to Cancun! I'm more scared at home since I live in El Paso, with Juarez 10 minutes from my house...Cancun safety has been at the same level as my previous trips, I never once felt threatened or unsafe. A lot of people were there so the people who choose to stay home because of what they heard are REALLY missing out!Teebaby"
"We are hoping to go back to Cancun in the Fall but it will have to stay a secret. My father is a little on the loco side at times...and he told us that if any of us go to Mexico, we are out of the will! This man lives in the mountains in the middle of no where. I live in Philly. I don't think it's any less safe for me to go to Cancun than it is for me to walk to dinner in Philly. So...Dad will think we are vacationing in Bermuda"
