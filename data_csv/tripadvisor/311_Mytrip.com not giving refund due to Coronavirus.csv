"Since you booked through a 3rd party, I'd say 6-8 weeks sounds about right. Try to get the details in email for your record. But I don't expect you to get your money sooner than that."
"Thanks for the quick response and info about the refund, that's a little more reassuring that I will actually get a refund...I've never been provided with an email address for mytrip.com, do you know what that maybe at all? Also in the case that after 8 weeks I have not received a refund how would you advise to proceed with getting my money back?Thanks a lot"
"The thing is no third party can give hou an exact time for refunding you. They will only refund you when they receive the money back from the airline. They will deduct their fees and pass this onto you. The airline will have a lot of refunds to process, so it could take time. Likewise the third parties are going to have a lot of people in the same situation and I doubt they’re going to recruit additional staff to help with the increase in admin work.Probably not what you wanted to hear. It would have been quicker and You’d have received a full refund if you’d booked directly rather than using a Shonky ticket reseller."
"Personally, I'd be very pleased that MyTrip are willing to refund you any money at all."
the email address for customer service is shown on their website.
You’re going to have to be patient. Keep in mind the enormity of this situation. This isn’t a simple cancelled flight. Air China is probably canceling thousands of flights many are much sooner than tours. Internal business in China is very disrupted so they’re likely short staffed. It’s going to take a bit. There’s no contingency plans for something like this. It’s not like a simple weather delay.
"So the subject line of your post is not correct? Mytrip.com is not ""not giving refund"". At this point they are just not certain when that refund will come your way?"
Mytrip is giving me a hard time about this matter. They are telling me that I can’t have my refund because the MEMO they got from air china says thay only those who are booked to fly from January to Mar 29 can only get the refund. But air china hotline says I can get my refund. I am scheduled to leave on Last week of April as well going to Ph.
"Who knows what the situation will be by the end of April. The death this morning of a Chinese traveller in the Philippines may mean more disruption. I’m not sure you can expect MyTrip to pay you a refund until they receive it from AirChina, and while things are so uncertain, all you and hundreds of others can do is wait."
"Added to which, while Air China may return the full price of the ticket to mytrip, my trip will take their fee off the amount they return to you when they do get round to refunding you. It seems they don't say on their website how much that will be but a quick google around suggests this may be up to £300 of your £406 air fare.SWT"
"Ooops, maybe I got mytrip confused with traveltrolley. Perhaps my trip does say on their website how much their service fee will be.SWT"
Mytrip refunded the whole air fare to me (outbound travel date should have been Feb 15). The money hit my account this evening. I can't fault the service they have provided given the circumstances and hopefully others will experience the same. Possibly refunds are being processed based on the date of travel.
"Thanks for sharing this,it calmed me down a bit! I'm due to fly to Thailand via Guangzhou in May and have been panicking that they won't refund me (I spoke to their CS and they said I need to check later as the date quite far away but likely they can refund the full amount)"
"As a data point for anyone following this thread, I just cancelled my Feb 18 trip to Thailand via Bejing (AirChina airlines) with absolutely no problems. I called customer service at 6465587089 which says it's a 24/7 help desk. There is a dedicated number to press if you are cancelling due to Coronavirus, they are advising anyone travelling within 2 weeks to stay on hold and all others to email them about cancellations. They cancelled, said they will refund the full amount in 2-16 weeks and sent a confirmation email of the cancellation."
This is good to hear I'm not the only one facing issues trying to get a refund from them. Hag eyou received any update on your refund from mytrip?
"HelloI am a student from Vietnam studying in Italy, I also bought a ticket via Mytrip to book a flight from Italy to Vietnam on March 2, 2020, but China Airlines canceled the ticket.Can you tell me how to contact Mytrip to ask about Refund or can you help me how to do it? I sent an email, I called Mytrip in Vietnam but it didn't workCould you help me? I am very worried, thank you very much!!Edited: 3:50 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"Hi! Good for you! Could you please tell me how you contacted them? I have a return flight to Manila through Beijing April 3rd, I tried emailing them but they are not answering."

"Hi! Tha same has happened to me! I have a flight to Philippines stopping in China which has been canceled from Lufthansa but Mytrip hasn't noticed me. I've been 3 day calling them so that they can give me an answer but nobody tells me anything, they just said that they need the confirmation of Lufthansa but lufthansa tells me that the responsible of this is Mytrip, I'm desperate..."
"Dealing with same issue, Mytrip told me to call directly the airline. I called the airline and they told me to call Mytrip.com for a refund. The airline told me since I booked my trip with this travel agency they cannot give me a refund. Called back Mytrip.com and told me they have to wait for updates with the airlines and wait 48 hrs . Is been 3 weeks and nothing. Like you a got a full refund from Delta airlines from LA to Milan . But Mytrip.com refuses to game me a refund."

"I live in Italy, which is currently a red zone and I cannot leave because of the law decree. I should have left for Egypt (round trip). I would like a refund but I can't find the phone number and email information. could you help me?"
"if the flight was cancelled then mytrip should receive the refund from the airline and should eventually pass it to you (probably less their admin fee)If the flight operated but you did not travel, you need to refer to your travel insurance policy to see if it covers your situation"
"The same matter, i have booked a trip for three persons in Mars 2019, i sent my canceling request seen the closing all flights between Quebec city and Toronto.I have sent them an email and no response. moreover, i have contected by telephone with a long waiting of 30 minutes and no response."
There are quite a few threads here warning you away from Mytrip.I hope you get your refund. Expect to wait . . . and wait. They are not a company I would trust with my money
How did you contact them? I've tried reaching through email but no response. My flight Barcelona-Mla is scheduled April 2 with layover and change in airline in HK. Philippine Airlines already emailed me that HK-Mla is cancelled but I get no response from mytrip.
That is because the world and his wife are also trying to get through and their customer service system must be in total meltdown with the volume of messages and calls - you have no option but to keep trying and be patient!
"I am also waiting for the refund from MyTrip, I got an email that they process my refund last March 5 and expect 3-5 business days..but up to now no refund yet."
What is the contact number you have for them? As I'm supposed to go to India on the 9th April. I email them but no reply...
"roquejo - they will need to wait for the refund to appear from the airline before they can refund youas per their website, it states ""Handling times with some airlines are currently estimated at 6-8 weeks""(3-5 days was unlikely to happen even if you had booked direct with the airline)"
"I'm also trying to contact them to start the process of asking for a refund. I've emailed them but also tried to phone them but their contact number on their website fails everytime I call. Anyone else got this issue, anyoe know of an alternative phone number?Edited: 10:35 am, March 29, 2020 "
"Quite a few threads here about this company. Skim the, for whatever answers you can find"
"My flight which I booked through them got cancelled and neither them nor the airline informed me about that. Further more airline offered re-booking ( with paying the difference in price) or a refund as a voucher. They did not offer classic refund which is against Air traffic passenger rights as the flight is inside the EU. I contacted the airline and they told me they can re-book my flights but if I want a voucher I should contact mytrip.I tried to reach mytrip through phone but none of the numbers were in service. On the Norway number I was put on hold for over an hour with no reply. Once when I reached them by submitting cancellation request they told me to contact the airline for a voucher but they can re-book my flight if I wish and I have to pay price difference.In the end I submitted my complaint to European association for customer protection as mytrip is a company registered in Greece. and the airline was reported to local agency for civil aviation.I was very patient with them even though my rights were broken several times (not contacting me, not offering free re-booking nor a full refund) but they were not even capable of arranging voucher issuance. While on the other hand they obviously cooperate very nicely in term of issuing ticket and paying for them."
I have booked tickets to turkey for myself and my wife and wee were returned at the airport as turkey had closed their borders while we are about to do the check in at the airport. and though our travel was halted due to closing the border then Turkish airlines also cancelled all their flights on our return dates. so I wrote mytrip to ask for full refund of our unused flight tickets as its not in our contro;l. so far havent heard from them.. not sure what to do next?
Did you manage to get ahold of anyone?

"Waaay too much personal info, Keith. Mytrip doesn’t come here, only spammers will see your personal infoEdited: 6:18 pm, April 06, 2020 "
Uuf I’m in the same boat. We were due to be flying on honeymoon yesterday. Bogotá to Hawaii. Really quite expensive tickets and a big outlay for us. The airline cancelled the flights almost two weeks ago and said that we would be entitled to vouchers to value of the flight or rebooking but the travel agency has to contact them directly. The rebooking this year is out of the question as we are in lockdown using our vacation days. The airline stated no issue just get Mytrip to contact them. After a cumulative 30 hours on hold I received an answer from the person manning the phones that I’m stupid and in fact I don’t understand the airlines policy and that I either board the cancelled flight or don’t but no voucher or refund (in contrary to my various and several conversations with the airline in question). Appalling customer service. I understand they are busy but being rude to someone who stands to lose a heavy portion of their savings is unjust.
"Lots of threads here warning you against using this company, sdw. Did you research before you gave your money away to this dreadful company?"

A bonus what?

"I have a mytrip flight booked for Russia Moscow on 18th of April.Mytrip.com website and their call centre says not to call more than 6 days before your flight. I followed that, but have not manage to get through in 3 days now. Today 15th April I managed to get through after 40 mins of waiting, an attendent took my detail, asked me whether i wanted a refund, and then asked me to wait until she checks some things, after which i was left hanging fore more than 30 mins, no music, no voice, call still on but nothing. They are basically waiting for you to cut, which I had to as my battery finished.I've tried sending emails, but also to no avail.Also in their emails they only give these options:""If you would like to rebook your existing ticket(s) form. Date changes are permitted only with the same airline and for the same route. Once we receive your answer we will send you an email with the alternative flights along with a payment link.If you would still like to cancel your ticket(s), please use this link.""Only rebooking and cancellation. So for refunds, they are making sure to make it unavailable.Anyone has managed to get through? And what if i don't get through before my original flight departure? I cannot get my refund?"
"Sorry, RSK, but you booked with a dreadful company. There must be 40 threads here complaining about Mytrip.comAssuming they don't go bellyup I expect they will refund some of your money eventually.Try calling them again with your phone plugged in or from a landline, so they can't use that trick on you. I was on hold with a vendor for 90 minutes today, had the phone plugged in and on speaker and when they got to me I was ready for action.Always research BEFORE you give away your money to companies."
Did you get a response?
"Hi,May I ask you how you contacted myrip.com or what are their contact number?What is you refund situation now? I have same issue andI am confused waht are their contact information since seems they have different emails."
Same here! My flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 and they declined to refund me.
"After reading this post, I got scared and called them yet their Australian number is not working any more.However I tried to contact them with webform on 'contact us' page, they do reply and they've now submit the cancellation to the airline waiting for airline's refund.My airline agrees to refund to agent actually. So hopefully I can get my refund in some time. Fingers crossed."
"Patience is needed.I have found MyTrip to be very easy to contact and respond to me. I filled out the refund request form as soon as the aus gov advice travel ban and they immediately responded and advised that I needed to wait for the airline to process refunds for earlier flights first and they would let me know ASAP about my flight, as at that time airline was only processing up to 25 April. The same day the airline announced flights for my departure date were cancelled, MyTrip contacted me with the official cancellation and asked if I wanted the refund or credit for later date. I submitted a refund request and they responded straight away that this has now been lodged with airline but could take some time to be processed. Who knows , maybe I will have issues getting my money back, but to date they have been very professional and helpful, so Be patient and don't say they refused refund in you header as this is misleading and wrong"
just go to their website and put in you trip details and you can submit a request for refund form. As long as the airline has cancelled your flights you should get a refund. But the refunds depends on the airline- some may only wan to give you a credit -- this is not Mytrip fault if airline not refunding.If you see my post no 50 on this thread I have had no issues contacting MyTrip or submitting request for refund form.
"I am waiting for any kind of reply from them for more than 2 months now. I have contacted airline and they have informed me, that they have aleady refunded money for my tickets back to mytrip, however mytrip does not refund me and does not even reply to me.Edited: 9:27 am, May 10, 2020 "

"Hi we have not heard back, but actually we are also finding who to contact difficult so I’m not sure they even had our message, we booked a flight from Melbourne on 13th March for the 27th and although the first leg was not cancelled the second part was from Bangkok to Heathrow. Clearly there was no flight possibility and Thailand were not letting people fly out or in so we are stuck as to where to go for help, whether Thai airlines will help or these people. Also if we had to then get a very expensive flight with Qatar via Doha can we get a reimbursement from my trip because of them cancelling? I’m stuck here who to contact! Any help appreciated, thanks x"

"Sorry - there were typos in my post above which I didn't notice until it was too late to change it so I removed it and am starting afresh! First off, it was NOT MyTrip who cancelled your flight Sarah - it was whichever airline you were booked onto.Secondly , although I understand that you needed to get home from Australia and therefore booked whatever flights you could in order to get here quickly , I am unclear who you think should be reimbursing you for that extra cost - it wouldn't be MyTravel (they did what you employed them to do ie booked you flights from Melbourne to Bangkok and another to London and will presumably be handling the refund on the cancelled leg from Bangkok to Heathrow ) as MT are not responsible for your personal reason (not being a Thai national ) for being unable to use the ticket they bought on your behalf for a flight which was not cancelled at all .IMO the only potential point of reclaim for the Melbourne to Bangkok leg ticket would be your travel insurer because you were unable to use your ticket because the Thai authorities wouldn't let you land there because of Covid19 related restrictions , NOT because the flight was cancelled . I cannot see any way that the Thai airline would be obligated to either refund you the cost of the ticket or contribute towards the cost of the one you bought from Qatar as it wasn't the airlines fault(nor MT's ) that you could not use the ticket you held . Similarly I cannot imagine you getting any redress from the Thai authorities for effectively banning you as a foreign national from landing in their country during lockdown. I personally think that the additional cost of booking the Qatar flight MAY be something that your travel insurance would cover, HOWEVER it depends on the cover you had with them and (as you only booked the flights on 13 March) whether the T&Cs on your policy had already have been revised to exclude any Covid19 related claims for flights by the time you booked the flights anywayI think that you need to chase MT to help you get the refund for the cancelled Bangkok to Heathrow flight, and speak urgently to your travel insurer about everything else. You need to find out exactly what cover you have for the Covid19 related disruption to your travel arrangements (ie the unused Melbourne to Thailand ticket that you couldn't use) and whether the cost of the new flights you purchased from Qatar in order to get home via another route are also covered as an expense directly associated with the covid.19 disruption to your original plans - if the insurance doesn't cover it then I think you have no chance of recouping the replacement flight costs from anyone - certainly not MT. Thai airlines will not offer you a refund or any compensation because their flight was not cancelled ,but at least you got home safely which after all is THE most important thing in all thisEdited: 6:11 am, May 18, 2020 "

Can you please help me how to file a refund/ Vouxher?"
"Faraz - if the only reason you personally cannot travel on the day you are booked to fly is the EU:USA travel restrictions NOT because the flight is cancelled ,you are not going to be entitled to a refund Faraz - that sort of thing is down to your travel insurance (if it covers pandemics of course to cover.Passengers are only entitled to a refund on normally non-refundable tickets if the airline cancels the flight completely - any other reasons for not being able (or wanting) to fly on the ticketed day are personal to you and the airline is under no obligation to reimburse you or if the class of ticket is not transferable even offer a credit/change of date! In the current situation most airlines are offering the option to reschedule even if in normal circumstances they would not do so. Have you checked the airlines Covid policies on its website - if MyTrip is not playing ball with you ,you need to know exactly what your options for a credit/rescheduling are so that if you discover your travel insurance WILL cover , you can cancel and reclaim your losses that way but it is very important that you do not instruct MyTrip to cancel until you know what you are going to do - if the flight is still scheduled and they misunderstand what you are asking them to do they may just cancel and you will lose all your recovery options other than insurance coverEdited: 4:37 am, May 26, 2020 "

Post 51 has the best advice we've seen. You picked a company with zero customer service so there's not much more to be said.You should also collect documentation of your attempts to contact them and file a dispute with your credit card company
"I will never book flight ticket on MyTrip. So far I purchased 3 times from MyTrip, there was no problems with flight. But with the situation of Covid-19, MyTrip response and treat customer in horrible way. I paid 800USD for flight ticket, but my flight been cancelled due to covid-19. I am waiting for the refund more than 1 month, and I need this money. I will never buy ticket from MyTrip again."
Did you finally get your refund?I am on the same situation... MyTrip just ignoring my e-mails... even air company is willing to refund.

"@ Northern Traveler . Well, 4 tickets Australia to Italy return $7,000 (back on the 26/6/2020).After reading all these reviews/feedback I tried to raise a dispute with my bank. They open the dispute but subsequently they closed as not a fraudulent transaction.I have now request mytrip a refund pending the airlines decision. Funny fact is that I was flying SingaporeAir and Lufthansa. I believe Lufthansa does not refund (on ther website) so best case scenario I will get half of the trip back and credit I will not be able to use. What I cant understand is how is possible they can collect 000's of bookings and credit cards payment per day and they cant process refunds. Should be a click of a button in my opinion.This is a pre-paid service than will not be delivered. They haven't spend a single dime on our flight but th electronic booking.Edited: 1:16 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Marco, you will not receive any money from MT until the airline refunds MT. This could take 6 months as MT have to request the refund, airline refund MT and then MT refund you, less fees. MT do not hold you Money they legitimately bought a ticket for you and transferred funds. Your bank is correct there is no breach of contract they did exactly as you asked.With the greatest respect you did not research before buying there are so many warnings out there about these online ticket floggers. Would you hand over money to a stranger in the street? I guess not so why hand over money on the internet. Always buy direct and you’ll have less problems."
"Smudge has the key points. You will need to contact the airline to determine if they refunded mytrip. It may not be easy, but you put yourself into this position by choosing a bad company to give your money to."
They do the same with me.They are telling me that Emirates (Flight fromCanberra to Hamburg 1300$) is not gettingA refund butI talked toEmirates and they toldMe I get a refund.I play that game Since 4 monthsNow.I understand theSituation isDifficult but theyAre lying about theAirlineRefunds.
"Mytrip is a very bad company, Anna. You should not have used them in the first placeRead post 92 and hopefully you can get your money back, but you can't just give money to strange companies and hope things will work out. Research is IMPORTANT"
"“ I talked to Emirates and they told Me I get a refund.”Not true. (I mean, they may have said this, but they are not correct.)Emirates is saying that they are giving a refund to their customer. You are not the customer of Emirates, so this doesn’t apply to you. Mytrip is the customer and they will be receiving a full refund. Your contract is with Mytrip and has nothing to do with Emirates. If you agreed to get vouchers when you checked that you read the terms and conditions, then that is what you should legally receive. What Emirates gives to Mytrip is completely immaterial to your contract with Mytrip."
"I've been waiting for a refund for 4.5 months...They keep sending me automatic responses that the refund will be issues once the airline processes the refund...The airline is Emirates and they do refund flights canceled due to covid, especially if it was the airline that canceled. In my opinion, Mytrip is one big scam and I would recommend never booking with them again. As for the refund, I think it's fair to say that you can forget about it."
I had troubles with being able to get my refund from them as well for my Philippines flights however after the initial long wait I started to call them multiple times per day until I was able to get through to someone who was useful and said he has requested for the refund for me and then the money was refunded back to my bank. I would just keep calling them and wait until you get lucky
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/etraveli-grou… You need to see this.I lost my money with that Company and that what they did with me . Do what you can to do. You need to start the complaint. THIS Company is A scam company
"Hi,has anyone managed to contact mytrip.com? or that they answered him?thx"
Sorry. We have thousands of posts here about Mytrip going back a few years. I don't recall a single successful contact with them.
I tried everything but without success :(
"Unfortunately that was predictable. Most of the online ticket sellers have zero customer service. We have threads on all of them here warning you to stay far away. You really HAVE to do research before you book with them and understand that the savings you see are going to likely disappear if you have any changes at all to your plans, whether you make the change or conditions like weather, disease, or equipment problems crop up.Book direct.

"Hi, We have similar issue. mytrip.com is scam company.Listen my ""funny"" story. Sometime ago we have purchased 2 ticket to Bali(for about 1.3k EURO). Due COVID-19 flights was canceled. So, we have asked for refund and mytrip.com said that you refund request is approved and they will send request for refund to Turkish Airlines. After 4 months I'm calling mytrip.com to get status updates - they said that they are waiting for refund from Turkish Airlines. I have contacted Turkish airlines to get status update for refund request. Turkish airlines said that there is not refund request. Nice, isn't it?I have tried to call from two phones to Turkish airlines and mytrip.com simultaneously to try to s solve this issue. Try to predict result? When Turkish airlines tried to ask them what is wrong they was disconnected call or ""paused"" call. How to solve this issue?"
How to solve? The only way to win is not to play. Find threads like this and the many others here warning you that Mytrip is awful BEFORE you give them your money.When you chose to use incompetent companies this is how you end up.I expect if you wait another year or so you may get a refund or voucher of sorts. Consider it an expensive lesson learned about researching companies before you throw money at them
"Vitalij, it's not very nice but it's also not exactly unknown, and mytrip are not the only company who lie and are difficult to get hold off.Why not have a quick browse of this forum while you're here, and you'll see many dismal companies popping up in multiple threads."
I also couldn't get refund from my trip....I sent a lot of mail and filled refund request form but they didn't do anything
"U can contact air china directly.I do it, and have refunded."
Just curious... Now it´s August. Did you ever get refund from Mytrip? I´m trying to refund my money back too...
