"I don't know if anyone has posted this yet, but there is an article in today's paper about long-hauling. It even quotes a TA Forum contributor.lvrj.com/business/going-the-long-way-costly-â€¦"
"Excellent article that identifies reasons and rationalizations for the problem, and what some consumers are doing to combat it including renting cars.Don't have any confidence that things will improve based on the tenor of the reporting.Thanks for posting this."
"Quote ""Taxicab authority board member Dean Collins estimates that at least a third of the trips out of the airport go the long way, based on his discussions with people in the industry. Some drivers put the percentage of long haul rides at 50 percent or even 70 percent.""Does not compare to the statistics often flouted on this forum.Edited: 8 years ago "

I've already decided that we'll be using Presidential Limo's airport service in future. You know what you're paying and you know you don't have to get into an argument with a cab driver as soon as you arrive.And we'll use them until they bring in a flat fare for airport cab rides.
"Whew!Tell drivers what you do want, not what you don't. If you are long-hauled, do not pay them, and report them to the Taxicab Authority (702) 668-4000:http://taxi.state.nv.us/default.htm."
Interesting that the article states that LVPD can also issue drivers citations for long-hauling.Recall when a driver tried to extort $50 from me on a McCarran to Strat run. I tossed him a $20 and told him to call the cops if he didn't like it. He took it and left. Now I know why.
"Ive said it on here before- couple of years ago a friendly driver told me if ever long hauled thru the tunnel then just refuse to pay, simple as that. Most people would want to avoid the confrontation id imagine but thats the way to do it.D1700-10"
"@Geocip: Yes. A bunch of us were sitting around a campfire one night, and there were three different ""Mike""s. First one said ""I'm just plain Mike."" so they needed to customize the other two Mikes. One shot .38 special, so he was Mike 38. It was a SASS event, and I was shooting .45 LCs, so ..."
"I'm glad I rarely take cabs in Vegas. The story about some tourists not just being tunnelled, but then taken south to Blue Diamond and up Las Vegas Blvd -- that driver should be arrested!"
