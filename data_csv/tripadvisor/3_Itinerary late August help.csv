"Hello everyone, Thank you in advance. A friend and myself plan to take a trip out in August and just want to see if this is not too time restraining.Aug 24th we will arrive in Las Vegas and get the rental around 10 am. we will drive out to zion and do some of the hikes there (suggestions would be great).August 25th we would hike Angels Falls, Nervous but feels like a must do haha. After hiking i was thinking of driving to Bryce and stay the night.Aug 26th- do some hikes in bryce and drive to arches, maybe do some hikes thereAug 27th- do what we missed in arches then drive down to Antelope Canyon areaAugust 28th- go to lower and upper Antelope canyon and do horshoe bend as wellDrive back to vegas and stay the night and fly out in evening of 29th.Any suggestions for some great hikes would be appreciated."
"You need to rethink this trip.First you need your lodging in placeSecond, Antelope Canyon is closed because of COVID-19Angel's Falls? Do you mean Angel's Landing which is also closed because of COVID-19 as you can only hike up to Scout's Lookout.I see why on these boards why COVID-19 is increasing in this country. People can not wait for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines before venturing all over the country spreading the virus."
"Yep, this is a totally unrealistic plan. It's obvious that you don't have a good understanding of distances between the places you want to visit, that you need timed entry shuttle bus tickets for Zion and even if the two Antelope Canyon tour were operating that you need to make advance tour reservations. You need to do a lit more research about this trip beyond picking out places to visit that you may have heard about somewhere.Edited: 12:58 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"Well thank you everyone for your input, I probably should have researched more before I had posted and looked at the covid situations. It was more to see if this was a possible trip or its just me packing things in too much of a cluster. This was an abrupt quick itinerary question, so yes I did not know the driving plan which, now I see it was bad.Also I, myself was not planning to come to spread covid if that was the assumption. Again I thank you all for the input, I will look into things further."
"The outlier here is Arches. If you took that out of the picture you could have a good trip.Spend the 24th and 25th in Springdale. Try to get tickets for the zion shuttle. Since you've missed the first batch of ticket offering you'll need to try for those available day before you want them at 9am on www.recreation.govA couple hikes you can take that first day without the shuttle would be Watchman or Parus trails which start near the visitor center. If you are able to get shuttle tickets then West Rim trail would be a good one up to Scout Lookout. This is where the Angel's Landing trail starts. Keep going up the west rim trail and you can get some nice views of Angel's Landing from above and same great views of the canyon. Another trail you'll want to take is the Riverside Trail at the end of the canyon. Then on the 26th head to Bryce. If there are spots in the parking lot Canyon overlook trail just past the tunnel is nice. Enjoy Bryce. Try to do the Navajo to Queen's garden loop. drive the scenic drive to Rainbow Point stopping at the viewpoints on the way back. Stay the night at BryceOn the 27th drive Highwy 12 to Boulder and back. This is an amazing stretch of road. You could head to Calf Creek Falls for a hike if you wanted. Stay in BryceThe 28th drive to Page. Antelope Canyons will probably still be closed, but Horseshoe Bend Overlook is nice and views of the lake from the rim trail are nice also. On the 29th take Highway 89A through Arizona stopping at Lee's Ferry to see the Colorado, and Jacob Lake for some cookies before heading back to LV."
"A decent suggestion from kbec. However, I don’t see a lot of value of driving all the way to Page just for Horseshoe Bend and a look/see of Lake Powell. 89A is a nice scenic drive. You are looking at a six hour drive from Page to Las Vegas by driving 89A."
"KbecJeans I greatly appreciate the feedback and thank you for the time, changing the itinerary around. I'm thankful for the kindness, I will definitely do more research of this itinerary. Thanks again, have a wonderful day!"
"""Also I, myself was not planning to come to spread covid if that was the assumption. ""The rural areas you are planning to visit have little ICU hospital space which should be reserved for the residents of the area. You could become sick on the plane and spread during your visit to the local population. You could also be asymptomatic COVID-19 contagiousness and shed and spread virus to the local population without your knowledge.That is the ""assumption"""
"The kicker with whatever itinerary you do will be getting hotel reservations and those pesky timed entry tickets for Zion. At this point, your option for those tickets is being online at 9 AM Utah time the day before. Or you can rent eBikes from an outfitter in Springdale. As you are researching hotels, you may need to look at going to Bryce first.and then Zion just for hotel availability. If you take that route, do two nights at Bryce. Skip Page. And then two nights for Zion."
"Thank you Connie for the reply. Yeah, those shuttle passes seem to be the issue that I should have looked at.Swimfan, these are all scenarios that are true that can happen, I respect that as you are concerned for the fellow citizens in these areas that people vastly visit. It was just the assumption from the initial reply that i'm some person coming to openly travel and not be thoughtful of the people in the state/area. I would hope people would take the safety measures to travel and think about the people that can be affected. Thats why i choose nature a bit more for an escape as it's something I hope I can distance myself from others to prevent the spread. Thank you for replies."
"@Chandra...Because of all the people who have descended on the Utah national parks with the mind set that being out in nature will somewhat negate the risk of exposure, trails are crowded and that makes it some what difficult to social distance. The small towns near the national parks are crowded. Also, not everyone visiting these parks are wearing face masks or making an effort to social distance. I’m glad that you seem to be approaching your travel with an awareness of the need to use appropriate measures when it comes to Covid. Be prepared with face masks and hand sanitizer. Take both with you when hiking.I hope that you are able to put together a travel plan that works for the time frame you have.Edited: 4:26 pm, August 05, 2020 "
