Does anyone know whether the coronavirus has affected anyone in Koh Samui or Koh Phangan?
None of the nearly 200 threads on the Thailand TA forum I've seen has confirmed thisWould it stop you from travelling to the islands if it had ?
If the virus scares you then you should be more worried about the recirculated air on airplanes ?
"No coronavirus cases have been reported in Ko Samui, Ko Phangan or any other place nearby.Ko Samui is busy as usual for this time of the year (high season)."
Just put a slice of lemon in your Corona and you'll be protected.
as you can see there are many haters who are on the forum who have no life.good luck with samui
"No cases of Coronavirus on Samui and the surrounding islands. Lets hope it stays that way. I will agree that you are more risk of any virus with the recyclated air on the aircraft! Its much quieter this year [the quietest I've know for this time of year], and there are not nearly as many Chinese. The thais are wearing the face masks that really only protect themselves. You see a few tourists wearing them."
This is what happens when people eat snakes and salamanders they pass it on

No hopefully not. I’m due there at the end of the month and have been looking forward to it.
Thanks for the info.
We have been told there are 40 cases just today
"#11 PerkyWhere, in Koh Samui or Koh Phangan? If you quote a number please back it up with a source."
"Yes, post11 is posting nonsense and trying to scaremonger. Another one post troll... these people need to get a life. Only 32 cases in Thailand and 10 have been released from hospital from what I read. Life is pretty normal here on Samui."
"Don't know why you say Chinese don't tend to come here; every time I am on Samui, Chinese outnumber every other nationality of tourist on the street."
"As far as the Chinese goes, it depends on area of Samui, there are many areas you never see them... whether there are lots here currently I am not sure, I've not seen many lately. They tend to hang out in higher end or mid range hotels/ resorts, as a block with their package tours. Occasionally one sees them at the several shopping malls checking things out. Still things seem fairly normal here, rare to see people wearing masks, that's not to say don't use precautions."
"Seriously....now the Chinese don't come to Samui....555 Although ""whether there are lots here currently I am not sure, I've not seen many lately."" ... does fall under plausible deniability....555But...high season and full.....contrary to official news.And the Chinese that do come, apparently don't leave their rooms.Come on Jim......that's a bit of a stretch, even for you.Can't just say the obvious, none / few infected or none died on Samui from VC. And leave it at that.Top 7 destinations for foreign visitors, with Samui at the bottom.....no surprise....555And topping the Samui list of visitors......Chinesehttps:/…D0-Gci-Nw-U8-AEVJNF.jpgEdited: 12:58 am, February 12, 2020 "
"Not Me, you posted a link to a 2 year old graph. According to to the local press (Siam Rath), Chinese visitors have not been topping the Samui list of visitors in 2019. Those were Germans."
"Oh here we go again""And the Chinese that do come, apparently don't leave their rooms.Come on Jim......that's a bit of a stretch, even for you.""I never said that NOT Me, you are just getting more and more stupid with every post you make bashing Samui. You being an expert ha, and you say you have only been here once... You really need to get a life."
"Waiting for the other 2 vested interest folks to chime in.Y'all a bit too obvious. Hey, I even suggested Samui as a destination to peek at this past week or so, and more than once. So not totally against the place, but in my opinion, there are better options.again.....for ""beach holiday""... others being cheaper or easier to get to, and get around once there, along with nicer surf when there.....IMHO, as I do get about the same weather and surf conditions as you, just a bit earlier or later, depending on winds. Not like I'm on the other side of a mountain."
"All getting together and censoring negative replies......guess I'll have to go the PM route.....555Keep posting silly statements, and I'll keep calling you on them.Your other post.....""2 box jelly stings in 8-10 years"", yet the Gov't admits (rare), 8 in the last year.Yea..........you're going to get somebody killed, let alone have a crappy holiday on Samui when they could have went elsewhere."
"Here, is this more current for you: up to 17 % from 13 %So Chinese top visitors to the island, but even they know there is better:https:/…"
"Not me, The graph you posted mentions a year on year growth of 17% of arrivals of visitors from China from 2017 to 2018 for Surat Thani. It doesn’t mention what’s the share of Chinese vs all visitors has been then and it is anyway outdated. And Ko Samui is not mentioned at all.But it does show that only 2.5% of all Chinese visitors made it to Surat Thani 2018."

Hi Chris Is it safe to travel to koh samui? We're supposed to be flying over there on Monday ...Are all the bars and restaurants open? Is it busy?CheersBelinda
Is it safe to travel to koh samui? Yes of course Are all the bars and restaurants open? Is it busy?Yes of course all bars and restaurants are open. And many are busy as usual.
I am travelling in April to Koh Samui. Hope it is safe. Any idea guys?
I'm going there soon as well and we can't predict what will happen. I don't believe the numbers they're posting but all we can do is wait. Take your precautions and be smart and you'll be good.
"I was at Bangkok Hosptial Samui yesterday speaking with the hospital director and asked if they'd had any suspected cases. They said they'd only had 4 people who proactively came to get tested and all 4 tested negative after having 2 tests done each. If I didn't read the news, media or FB you wouldn't even know it existed, business as usual. Only difference is people are wearing masks at the airport and on the flights (not all) and alcohol gel is being used more readily but haven't seen many people walking around with masks on."
"Hospitals in the epic centre location and modern hospitals need a certain equipment to correctly diagnose COVID-19 positive. While I don't doubt the hospitals in KS, but I do have concern on how they do the test.. A simple temp taking and assessment of body health is not enough."
"SaintAuroraSky, that is not how it's done in a large country like Thailand. Thai hospitals would send a blood sample to the government science center to test for the coronavirus. Same procedure for example in the UK which uses a limited number of laboratories for testing as well."
"2 wrong statements in this forum:- Bad air in the aircraft is just a myth. The recirculation of air in aircraft is done through very high efficiency particulate filters,(HEPA), same as the ones used in operating rooms in hospitals and mixed with ultra-clean fresh air from aoutside. Actually the air in aircraft is much cleaner than the one you usually inhale! - The mask is not protecting the person who wears it againts the virus, it is protecting the other people around him if this person carries the virus."
"Thailand has not reported a new corona virus case for 7 days now. Meanwhile Italy, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Iran have now more cases than Thailand. And continue to report additional cases on a daily basis. Why is that ? Probably because of the tropical climate here. Like the flu the coronavirus seems to thrive in a cold climate. Influenza, which is just another contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses, is almost unknown in Thailand. There were 169,000 cases in Thailand in 2018 (0.24% of the population). Compared to 35,500,000 who got the flu in the 2018/19 season in the US (11%). So it's 45 times more likely to get influenza in a predominantly cold country like the US compared to a tropical country like Thailand."
Interesting to read how flu viruses thrive in colder Countries than Thailand. I’m sure we will be fine. Not long til we set off now.
Any updates? I'm supposed to be leaving tomorrow. Freaking out a teeny bit. Not worried about catching it am worried about being quarantined when I come home :-O Someone tell me it's pre flight anxiety! :-)
"""it's pre flight anxiety! :-)"" Yes, get over it!!!! I had to take someone to the Samui Hospital in Nathon this morning, I don't think seen the hospital so quiet on a week day... In and out in just over an hour, with the prescriptions in hand! The waiting area and emergency areas no where close to being full.There is no panic on, hardly anyone wearing masks... life is pretty much normal, just quieter in some areas."
Was wondering why one of Bangrak’s most expensive restaurant was pretty full and had a ‘reserved’ sign on all empty tables.Heard later that a number of European companies evacuated their senior staff incl families from Hong Kong or China to Ko Samui. These people run their business apparently now from Ko Samui waiting for the Coronavirus to go away. These people wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t safe.
Just hope none of those Chinese are infected.
"Stingray, my post below was in relation to European citizens being moved from HK and China to Ko Samui when the crisis started a month agoEdited: 12:24 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"I see, well they should safe by now."

Business must be bad. It’s so transparent that some posters have a finically interest in Koh Samui tourism.
Let me know how you get on Jen. I’m in the same boat - due to depart in a weeks time. Hope all goes well
"As one who does not have a financial interest in any business on Samui, there is no problem except people sitting at home overseas just scaremongering with a vivid imagination. Nothing is closed, even the local government hospital was less busy than normal for a week day. Very few people are wearing masks, those that are, are on motor bikes, protecting themselves from dust..That's not to say don't take precautions at airports etc but it's all a little over blown."
"No reported cases , I have relatives there"

I am travelling this Friday so we are safe right?
"Sure, it's safe here in Ko Samui"
"I am not a professional on these matters, but my opinion is that getting maimed or killed in a scooter accident on Koh Samui is far more likely than death or a near death experience caused by coronavirus in the same locale. I'll be back for my twice annual trip in a couple of weeks."
"We are here in Koh Samui and everything seems pretty normal, although it IS quiet. The Central Festival Shopping Centre in Chaweng was pretty much deserted yesterday afternoon and the Main Street was very quiet. We had a meal on the beach and the bar was busy, but the drinks prices had been reduced, so businesses must be suffering.There are no confirmed cases on the island. I would far rather be laying on a beach in the sun with lots of fresh air and few people around, than be shopping in a supermarket in the cold and wet UK, with hoards of people near to me... wouldn’t you?"
Thanks
"I have just heard that there have been 3 cases connected to staff in Central Festival, 1 Chinese man has died and 2 other staff tested positive. Any one else heard this ."
"""I would far rather be laying on a beach in the sun with lots of fresh air and few people around, than be shopping in a supermarket in the cold and wet UK, with hoards of people near to me... wouldn’t you?"" .......... Unless the island went into lockdown with no one coming in or out. You holiday just might turn onto a nightmare."
"It would appear that Samui is currently free of the virus.There are over 40 cases in Thailand as a whole..The main concern about Samui is that as a major international tourist destination it involves the movement on and off the island of large numbers of international travellers as well as workers from those countries. I Work with many Chinese people none of whom have arrived after the Corona outbreak was identified. One however, sadly returned to Wuhan just before Christmas."
"""There are over 40 cases in Thailand as a whole..""LOL. It's funny how not testing people leads to fewer cases.Having said that I would still travel to Thailand right now... If my flights were more than a couple of weeks away I'd be worried - not of catching the virus but of flight disruption, quarantine requirements and the potential for insurance to be invalidated."
"Note that there are abiut 3500 cases currently under surveillance.If you travel with any possible symptoms, you may well be taken over to be checked."
In Thailand There are about 1000 persons under investigation for possible virus infection. In all of Thailand there are twelve (12) patients who tested positive and are hospitalized.There is no law in Thailand that would allow authorities to force people to quarantine. No hotel or island would ever be in lock down unless the laws are changed.And no confirmed cases in Ko Samui.
We are coming on Friday (albeit with 3 nights in Bangkok first). Fingers crossed for no disruption prior to then!
Source?
"How did you go? Did you end up going? We have a trip booked to Phuket, Khao Lak and Railay Beach in 10 days and I'd love to know what the situation is like over there."
"Just woke up, Wednesday SE Asian time zone, and read that Thailand is going to make people from 11 areas go into mandatory self-quarantine for 14 days if they enter Thailand. What do you think, Chris? You seem to be saying that this is pretty much impossible to enforce?Japan, Germany, South Korea, China ""including its special territories Macao and Hong Kong,"" Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy and Iran have been declared as ""dangerous communicable disease areas.""Anyone traveling from those places will have to self-quarantine for 14 days ""with no exceptions,"" Charnvirakul added."
"Hermit, that’s quite a bitter pill to swallow to say on here! So even through transit on your said destinations??"
"I would be great to hear from anyone from the above 11 countries, if you are flying into, or entering Thailand in any way, from today onward. Those of use who have trips planned in the near future will be very interested to know what they do to you. Like, are they going to tattoo a big Q on our forehead and give us quarantine papers to post on our hotel door? Are hoteliers going to be instructed to keep us under lock and key? The news stories say that we will not be able to leave our hotel rooms for 14 days. I have a bit of trouble imagining hotel staff in Thailand wanting to or being able to take on that task."
"Jo, so far, in any of the news stories I have read, they made no mention of people ""transiting"" these countries, so ""maybe"" transiting is okay? For example, many North Americans fly through Tokyo/Narita on the way to Thailand. Maybe they would not be counted as having been ""in Japan."" Anyway, I'm not sure because ""transit"" people are not mentioned. Other countries like Singapore are very good at making their rules clear regarding ""entering"" vs ""transiting"" etc."
"There were two cruise ships in Nathon today, island tours taking place as normal and lots of boat people wandering around the streets of Nathon... Not wearing masks! There is also a small festival going on near the Nathon ferry docks that looked busy.Traffic on roads varied from being light to heavy in some areas towards Bophut.  Tesco and Big C etc. were reasonably busy."
the Thai government meanwhile clarified it ‘welcomes all nationalities to Thailand and that quarantine is not required if travellers are healthy’.There are currently no temperature checks at Ko Samui airport.
"This just appeared on the Guardian site:""There is some confusion in Thailand over what quarantine measures are being introduced for people travelling from countries hit by the coronavirus.On Tuesday, the country’s public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, posted an order on his official Facebook page stating that people arriving from Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy and Iran would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.But hours later the post disappeared, and the minister’s Facebook page appeared to have been deactivated. A ministry spokesperson said that a correction was being made and that an updated announcement would appear soon. This is yet to materialise."""
"From link by KronickR. Seems nothing for sure in the future. Appears to be risky arriving to Thailand.""Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health officials had told reporters that they will be reissuing new guidelines.Meanwhile, Bloomberg, citing Health Ministry spokesman Taweesilp Witsanuyotin on Wednesday, reported that the idea to impose a mandatory 14-day period of self-quarantine on travellers coming from high-risk countries is not off the table.""Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/covid-…"
"That is not official yet. But I think it is stupid to post such things on a Facebook page, there must better ways of communicating changes to everyone.I think Spain and the UK may well be added to the list soon. Switzerland also."
"At height of the epidemic in China when thousands of new cases were reported in China, Thailand did not close its borders to Chinese visitors nor did they require any kind of quarantine. It’s very unlikely that they will do it now for countries which have only reported a fraction of the cases compared to China."
"I see China is restricting travel from high risk countries as they don't want it back.I think the biggest issue is the 20,000 illegal workers coming back from South Korea.Edited: 12:40 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Take note of your country's status before visiting Thailand....this list will only get bigger. ""11 locations, now designated by Thailand as “high risk” areas, are Japan, South Korea, Germany, China, Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy and Iran, plus the two Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau.• Visitors and Thai citizens returning from the high risk areas will be subject to 14 days home quarantine, even if they are cleared of the disease, unless they have permission from health officials.https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/coronavirus/…Edited: 11:42 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"The update did indeed materialize. The DDC posted a ""clarification"" of the current policy the morning of 3/3. In a nutshell, the policy has not really changed, even for those from ""high-risk"" countries: If you look sick and/or have a fever, you get thrown into a facility for further testing; if you don't look sick and/or don't have a fever, you go on your merry way, but are asked to monitor your own health condition, wear a mask, wash your hands, avoid crowds... The second part of this pdf is what you want to see:https:/…news_no38_030363.pdf"
In short nobody will be subject to 14 days home quarantine unless sick. You also don't get thrown into a facility for further testing if you have symptoms. You will be sent to a hospital.

There is still a lack of clarity still surrounding the government's plans for isolation.The health minister certainly isn't up to speed on this so expect further vacillations.https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…
"Sure would be nice if they all got on the same page, whether talking or reporting.As the news-blip is different from what they said hours earlier.

Whatever the situation is going to st worse before it gets better.This will mean quarantine and travel restrictions not just in Thailand but in countries of origin and stop offs en route..E.g the peak in UK is predicted in May.As for the USA with 27 million uninsured ....
We are due to travel to Koh Samui via HK in 4 weeks. I tried to change our flight from HK to Koh Samui (Bangkok Air via Cathay) to leave a little sooner (cancelling the HK leg of the trip) and am told there are no seats available any day earlier than we are booked. This seems fishy and I see that Bangkok Air has partially restricted some flight paths now including HK to Samui from 1 May. I’m wondering if they have actually started cancelling those flights earlier in which case our whole trip likely won’t go ahead as we were only going to to HK to Samui and I prefer not to fly via Bangkok with 3 young children at the moment. Also presume this has an impact on whether we can claim for the flights if cancelled by the airline.Is anyone else in a similar boat or know more about the Bangkok Air restrictions? I would call but can only find a Thai number!
"It is already established that people without insurance are avoisding taking the corona virus test as it costs $3400.00 and even some with insurance ae worried about the effect it will have on their premiums. Although as of yesterday PM, the VP has stated insurance companies have been ""told"" to pay for tests, he has made no comment on the 27 million uninsured.Edited: 6:26 am, March 07, 2020 "
"They said on the BBC news last night tests were $1,100 I think, certainly was not $3,400 but with the money they are resourcing it now that may well change. But they don't have enough test kits."
"Under Thailand’s health schemes, 99.5% of the population have health protection coverage:https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/20…"
"I read Bangkok Air like many airlines has cancelled flights, it's too expensive to fly nearly empty planes. Airlines are really struggling with lower numbers already. If flight is cancelled then the airline should refund all the money without fees or offer you an alternative flight. Why go to HK instead of Bangkok?"
"Test start at about 5000 baht at Krung Thep hospital, and up to 13,000 baht. Why testing isn't really done here, unless on your death bed.Private hospitals don't take the Thai universal plan, an queue at public hospitals can be silly long.Chula at 3000 baht, but queue for registration starts 2 hrs before the hospital even opens, and queues are ridiculously long, and good chance you may not be service that day.Edited: 6:55 am, March 07, 2020 "
@StingRay - we were originally doing 5 days in HK hence the stopover there. It’s on Cathay so any flight to Thailand has to go via HK. I’d rather not do both HK and Bangkok...HK alone making me nervous to go through. Well I’m hoping they did cancel the flights because then at least we can get a refund like you say.
Are they not offering free cancellations to HK? Some airlines are offering free cancellations because of coronavirus.
As of now Cathay is not offering that on our route but I spoke with them today and it might be offered soon.
"I see. Hope you can sort this out. I know someone who had her flight with Cathay cancelled at the last minute almost, she had to pay quite a bit of money extra to get a new flight, she is now trying to claim from her travel insurance."
"""Test start at about 5000 baht at Krung Thep hospital, and up to 13,000 baht. Why testing isn't really done here, unless on your death bed.""Which is unfortunately it seems very probable the disease is transportable before symptoms show."
"Be aware that there arware several events on Samui...graduations, immigration campaigns where hundreds of people, some VIPs, will be gathering from all over the world...Malaysian, Cambodian, Laos, Burmese, Singapore and even Chinese.There appears to be no checking of these people at all.Managers of these I institutions seem either uniformed or unconcerned about the possible risks."
"Even if they did temperature checks it would pick up few infected persons, that’s why some countries don’t bother with them. They need to have test but even then it often takes days for the results. Large gatherings are not a good idea, some countries are banning them now. Many people got infected from 2 persons at a carnival in Germany recently."
"These events are questionable at best.Hotels, schools etc have rules about staff and employs traveling abroad but no such responsibility for precautions against those they invite to gatherings."
"#106... per Richard BarrowsCathay was actually telling psgrs the official policy of mandatory quarantine on arrival.....555....not being enforced yet.Edited: 7:17 am, March 08, 2020 "
"We fly 3 weeks saturday via Singapore to Koh Samui, no intention of cancelling unless they cancel our flights. If the Uk is added to the self quarantine list this may obviously change our plans as not spending 2 weeks int he hotel !"
"So far no one is locked up in their hotel, I suspect it will stay that way... for those people here life is pretty normal. It's such a shame to see so many people have cancelled their trips.The odd person is wearing a mask, which they say on world news is not necessary unless you have the virus or symptoms of. Obviously take some precautions in high volume places like airports. Follow advice of your government advisories,"
"Thanks Jim P for your comments about the current situation in KS. Are you able to provide further comments- are people shopping, swimming, eating in restaurants etc etc? Are there many tourists? I am due to fly to KS via Singapore at the start of next week. I am deciding if I proceed with my one week holiday or abandon it. I don’t want to be quarantined on arrival. Our Aus, govt web site Smart traveller tells me that I should be able to transit through Singapore.Thanks for your help."
"Yes, people are still shopping, swimming and eating in restaurants. We arrived last Thursday and tourist numbers are definitely down but people are still out enjoying themselves. The only people I have seen wearing masks have been staff in HomePro or Tescos."
"I've a trip booked (all non-refundable) in early April, but the Govt of India MOH have manded on 10-March for 14-days self-quarantine on returning from Thailand, this has made me to drop my travel plans. :(Edited: 5:41 am, March 11, 2020 "
"That's too bad Vineet, not sure why they would include Thailand.I was around many areas of Samui today, I stopped at three shopping centres and saw no checking for temperature and just a few people wearing masks. Tesco had lots of items on 2 for 1, or buy 2 get 1 free promotions, obviously to reduce stock.Traffic was fairly heavy in some areas, light in others."
"Same here, except i'm flying from Canada via Air China and have a lay over of 2 hours in Beijing.Now Thailand is requiring health certificate indicating negative test results from Covid19 if you are flying from China. I'm only doing layover but i believe they would still require these certificates from us. This is nearly impossible so I have to cancel all my non-refundable hotels... I honestly would love to change the dates at hotel, perhaps to later this year or next.But so far, no luck yet..."
"I believe the certificate has to be issued by the airline before you get your boarding pass, so you may need to check-in earlier. Also I'm not sure the rule applies to transfers."
This may fact people thinking of travelling to anywhere in Thailand.https:/…idUSKBN20Y0R0
"According to Richard Barrow the medical certificate is now required for transit passengers as well.“All transit passengers from risk countries also must have a medical certificate.”Asked how that was possible while the passengers were in transit, Mr Thanee replied, “That is the passenger’s responsibility. My responsibility is to protect against the spread of the virus.”Edited: 1:58 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I read it was only if you were in transit for over 12 hours.
The source doesn't mention the time in transit. It says all passengers. It also has links for the T8 app:https://www.thephuketnews.com/phuket-airport…
"Who knows there are so different advises floating around and they change them daily. I also read the certificate has to be within the last 2 days, doubt many will have that. So looks like even less tourists in Thailand, unless there is another u turn tomorrow."
"This is from Cathay Pacific website: ""Effective 12 March 2020, passengers departing from People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong SAR & Macao SAR), Korea, Italy and Iran are required to have the following at check-in:Health certificate, Link opens in a new window operated by external parties and may not conform to the same accessibility policies as Cathay Pacific along with a negative COVID-19 laboratory result issued within 48hours of flight departure (applicable to all nationalities)Health insurance document that provides at least USD100,000 coverage in Thailand (not applicable to Thai nationals)Passengers from the above zones will be subject to a 14-day self-quarantine upon entering Thailand or the length of their visit (if less than 14-days).Exemption: Transit passengers through the above places are exempt from the above requirements."""

"A biglot concern now is that if corona gets on to the island it may well be undetected or worse still, covered up. Tourism is the sole reason for the islands economy and it would be devastating for the island to be hit by Corona.At present the islands institutions seem to be living in a fool's paradise with little more than a nod to the impending situation."

"StingRay,I've read that link and I'm a little confused. We are arriving from the UK on 4th April and as it stands would we need to quarantine or can we travel around but check in with the supervisor as to where we go and what we do?It just seems like we are heading down that road of Thailand not letting anyone in.

"This is the bit i'm referring to:For traveler arriving from an area with ongoing local transmission as announced by the MOPH, they have to be under observation (meaning supervision without quarantine) in order to ensure self-monitoring for no less than 14 days until the end of the infectious period or the reason for suspicion. The aforementioned traveler must record his/her own symptoms in the reporting system and monitor his/her symptoms strictly required by the MOPH. The travelers from areas with ongoing local transmission must notify the disease control officer about the places they visit so that a surveillance officer can closely monitor their movement and contacts."
https:/…index.phpThat's where I got the literature from. Just trying to work out if it's even worth going if we are stuck in our hotel room for 14 days. Also learnt that our insurance will not refund us because the UK government has not changed it's status on Thailand on all but essential travel
"My understanding is it is not quarantine but you have to give them contact details, where you are staying etc. Mobile phone number and then you maybe checked, not sure as this has not started yet. So I think you are free to move around as long as they know where you are."
That's a bit of a relief then! It's going to be an interesting few weeks!

Thanks!!Very helpful??
"3 day old news, and lots of cancelled, of the cancelled notices have been cancelled, updated and or modified.Everything is a clear as mud."
Happen to talk to the infectious disease specialist at Bangkok Hospital Samui today. There have been no COVID-19 cases on the island to date.Anyone can come and get tested (but very few people actually do). As former UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said some Asian countries like Thailand have been “strikingly successful” at stopping the spread of the virus by taking “social distancing” measures.
"I don't think the ex health secretary was referring to Thailand. Creating mass confusion and selective testing/reporting is hardly ""strikingly successful”.Edited: 4:22 am, March 14, 2020 "
Yes he did:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…
I stand corrected. He did mention Thailnd but he's an idiot.
I'd rather they just came out and said no ones allowed in for 2-3 weeks. It leaves alot of uncertainty for the locals and tourists.
"""As former UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said some Asian countries like Thailand have been “strikingly successful” at stopping the spread of the virus by taking “social distancing” measures.""the guy's a fool"
Where is the social distancing in Thailand? Don't think he has a clue.
None the European cheek kissing when greeting people ! No shaking hands is allowed.Only a wai or elbow knocking or foot touching is allowed!
"""Where is the social distancing in Thailand?""Firstly Thai people was rather than shake hands and then the climate means that people spend a lot more time in the open.It is no coincidence that in temperate climes winter is the prime time for spreading viruses"
I would still travel
Slowly but surely everyone are closing their borders and enforcing quarantines. I think we're at the point where travelling is a bad bet for the majority of people.This global outbreak is still accelerating and there will be more and more severe measures to counter it. Businesses and airlines may well start to fail. You really don't want to be stuck far away from home if things go the way they are looking.
"Me too Maxine,We are still in mind that we are travelling in 5wks time unless authorities tell us we can’t....... or our airline does!!"
5 weeks time lol! Good luck with that.
Good luck with that???? As I said we will still be coming unless forced not to by other powers!
"Hate to be negative, but that's pretty much going to be guaranteed.My daughter told me there's 13 confirmed cases at her uni, in which 3 teaching buildings have been shut down.Bangkok Unk completely shut down, according to news, 'suspected cases'....yea, we believe that.Mahanakhon Building, largest skyscraper in Thailand, completely shut down, because 1 employee tripped a fever sensor, and didn't even gain access to the building....yea, we believe that.Guessing there are far more cases than reported, or people wouldn't be stocking up home supplies. Like ourselves, just in case, you get a fever, stores won't let you in to by food. So freezers are full for a good 2 week supply, JIC we develop a fever, as my daughter has already. Could just be the flu, it is that season, or CV-19. Irrelevant, a fever is fever. If getting one while here, you won't be leaving and or quarantined when returning home..........that's not a holiday I would want."
More governments suggesting people should not travel or return home ASAP not travel etc... more panic while people jam up lines in airports with no social distancing in these longline ups... That is being pointed out on several news casts on YouTube from around the world ... The knee jerk reaction could be be worse than not have everybody do that.There is lots of news from many countries on the subject on You Tube.Canada and Denmark were added yesterday. USA seem to be suggesting restaurants amongst other venues all be closed.... this is going to take a long while before things get back to normal.
"Yes, there are a lot more actual cases in all countries. Maybe 10 times more or 100 times. Especially in Europe or the US, where you don't get tested unless you are already sick. In Thailand, everyone who wants to get tested can get a test. Many hospitals are running at a fraction of their capacity.Thailand is ranking now on 69th place with 1.6 cases per one million inhabitants between Puerto Rico and Senegal. Switzerland, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, AustriaFrance, Belgium,Germany, Netherlands have 40 - 250 times more cases. Does anybody really think that Thailand could be ""hiding"" 4500 positive tests?"
"Free testing is available for some, if the hospital and only certain hospitals will do it.Before announced just the other day, the free testing made available at certain hospitals, the cost for cheapest testing was 3500 - 5000 baht, or 10 days to 2 weeks salary for Thais, and let's be honest, who is going to spend that just to find out the flu symptoms they have is or isn't caused by CV-19.Not like CV-19 is going to kill you, unless very unhealthy to begin with.Truly is nothing but MSM hysteria. The only thing real, is the chance of getting a fever, and having one's planned travel 'sidetracked' because of the hysteria."
"There are currently 35 labs in Thailand that each can test up to 200 specimens daily, and 20 more are expected to open soon. An there is one central lab that can perform 4000 tests per day. The people in the United States of America probably wish their country had that kind of capacity."
"Not coming to KS until June , and I will unless physically or legally stopped...with or without insurance....its impossible to get 'travel disruption' cover in the UK. If I must self isolate I'd prefer a warm sunny beach to 4 walls at home.Yes its serious but the experts suggest we'll all get the new 'big C ' at some point so why fret about it! Life will go on"
"Hi there,You can now check the real time COVID-19 tracking in Thailand herehttps://covidtracker.5lab.co/en"
"It's remarkable that people coming from country without a functioning public health system to live in Thailand , benefit from Thailand's public health system and then use this forum to complain about the very system they use. Getting benefits they would have to pay dearly for in their home country. The US CDC, for example, has stopped testing for the virus on March 12 and there have been not a single testi by US public health labs on March 14 nationwide:https:/…A Chinese from Massachusetts had to fly back to China to get tested and treatment as she couldn’t get tested or treated in the US. She tested positive in China.Compared to what's going on in the US (or the UK) Thailand seems to be shining example of efficiency when it comes to public health."
"After 10 years of putting it off we finally booked our first visit to Koh Samui (or Thailand in general) just before Christmas.We're due to fly out on April 23rd,,,not holding out much hope :("
#168 if they have stopped testing for it why are the cases going up everyday?Looks like they have updated the figures on that site.
"They are not reporting many of the cases. I know of 13 'confirmed' cases at my daughter's university (Thammasat). They closed down 3 teaching section / building, including hers. Teaching online now.BKK Uni just below her's has completely shut down. That's just one small area of Pathum Thani province, times that by 50 or 77 provinces. Other people are not getting tested. Few hospitals do it for free, two even having dual pricing for farangs.....classicThe count is all BS. When they / MOH gave the last update yesterday, the comments were stating the same, when he said at Stage 2, many comments said why not Stage 3, and 2 was BS. Also would explain the 'stocking up' / panic buying as people realize to go shopping now, before getting a fever, as I did the same.Rule #1 worldwide, never believe you gov't.Edited: 6:59 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Getting sick isn't the main issue, getting flights in the future would be my concern.Traffic to BKK has dropped considerably: ""Year on year comparison of passengers at Suvarnabhumi airport on 15 March 2020 saw a 60% reduction in the number of passengers & 33% reduction in the number of flights.Airplane 726 flights vs. 1,084 flights (-33%) 79,899 passengers vs. 200,949 passengers (-60%)""Along with this news blip of possible future cancellations. How long can they operate flights at a loss: https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1880135/gl…Edited: 7:09 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Not me you are worried about 13 unreported cases in Thailand while they are reporting a 1000 or more new cases every day in multiple countries in Europe?At least in Thailand they are testing everyone who wants to be tested. And testing is free if you have symptoms.In Italy and the UK they only test very sick patients already in the hospital. And the US has run out of test kits altogether.
"And in Thailand almost everybody try and avoid getting tested, like the returning Thais from Korea.So what good is it then that Thailand tests those that want to.You try to do everything you can to pretend everything is fine in Thailand."
"Live here, don't care about the rest of the world.Don't think people gets tested without symptoms, and would think most having to (not all free), wouldn't bother anyway. Why would you ?Better info source for you:https:/…Edited: 2:38 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Not everything is obviously fine here. But it should be more worrying that you are send away from hospitals in the UK or the US, even if you have symptoms . You cannot get tested in those countries unless you are seriously sick (or famous) and people who have symptoms can continue wander around and spread the virus. Testing in Thailand is free, if your test is positive. A two weeks stay at Thailand's most expensive hospital , Bumrungrad Hospital, for COVID-19 treatment is THB 200.000. The same would easily cost you THB 1,700,000 in the US. And many Thais actually do have insurance that cover the treatments. Many Americans don't."
"A lot of inaccurate statements there. Nobody in the USA is turned down for medical treatment. Whether they have insurance or the hospital (public) gets paid is a different story.The rest, how would you know, unless you are there, and I'm sure a 2 week stay at BumCrap, for anything, cost a lot more than 200k.Ex: colonscope at Udon General 2,800, BumCrap 28,000 last time I read about.Edited: 3:23 am, March 17, 2020 "
"I am not posting stuff I read on fox news or some expat forum. Most is based on my personal experience or that of my friends, colleagues or acquaintances. The THB 200,000 bill was the actual bill of an acquaintance (Thai) in Bangkok who got COVID 19 and spent two weeks at Bumrungrad. Myself I was at Bumrungrad the last time last month.Not Me, stop posting about things you only read about it on the internet as you obviously don't understand it."
"Iv just had an email from my airline saying my particular flight is still live and nothing has changed “so far” Yes I know the probability will be cancellations from them but the route we are flying (Heathrow-CHANGI-Koh Samui) is still standing in 5wks.Until they tell me I can’t fly or your fabulous island doesn’t let us in we are still coming haha!! Let’s not fight on here, who’s right n who’s wrong. Use the fight to look after yourselves and loved ones."
"Yes Jo D, my sentiments entirely. We too will be going on April 23rd unless we are physically retrained!"
"My family are also heading out to BKK from LHR for 2 days and then onto Koh Samui for 2 weeks!Only flight cancellation or Thailand Borders closing will stop us!it will be our first holiday since we had our 2yo son so really hoping we can still come!Edited: 5:18 am, March 17, 2020 "

"I asked the question in this Forum. I had some useful info back. We went out on 28 February returning on 11 March.We had a fantastic holiday flying into Bangkok, connecting to Koh Samui and after a few days ferry to Koh Phangan. Great places, blue skies and seas. All I needed for an enjoyable holiday. I even got to the cancelled Full Moon Party with my family. The trip back was very long though it went smoothly, the only problem being Flybe going under so our UK domestic flight was cancelled. The Thai people are very friendly and polite. Well worth going to Koh Samui and Koh Phangan. Oh yes, I saw no sign of coronavirus at all."
"Yip, we booked to leave 13th May for a month, and we will be there too, flights etc permitting!"
@everyone - sorry i forgot to post that we are booked to leave on 15th may.But yes as-long as we haven't been cancelled then we will be travelling to Thailand. As many people have said this is all getting blown out of proportion.
"""As many people have said this is all getting blown out of proportion""I actually hope for all our sakes it doesn't come to it but one day you may understand."
"There are no 'confirmed cases' on KS yet. Though with tourists entering and exiting regularly I expect it's because it's difficult to get tested here and people avoid the hospital. I'm here for another month (home is NZ) and plan to stay. The big risk (asides from the actual virus), is being stuck in a foreign country with void medical insurance and little option to get home. So weigh you options.Right now Samui seems quiet. OK if you want to chill on the beach."
"Can I please add to my own post - if you choose to travel now, please be more respectful of what THE WHOLE WORLD is advising. Just don't. I'm already abroad and have taken the risk to stay rather than fly home. But, If you have the option not t start new travel, don't be reckless."
"#190 ""I expect it's because it's difficult to get tested here and people avoid the hospital.""There are five hospitals on the island and I understand you can get tested at two: Bangkok Hospital in Chaweng and the government hospital in Nathon. I have been recently at the Bangkok Hospital. It's not overly busy but also not really empty. There always a few tourists there who fell from their motorbike. No problem to get an appointment with the hospital's infectious disease specialist. And yes, as of today, no COVID 19 cases on the island."
"I’m current here in Koh Samui now, no cases on ether island have been reported."
"From what I understand from a fairly reliable source, the tests are done at the Samui Hospital, even the ones where the blood is taken at the Bangkok hospital is sent to Nathon... (Higher price too!) The Labs at the Samui Hospital are ""state of the art"" and most test and results for most blood tests are done in hours, and not days.Someone I know was at Samui hospital this afternoon, they are checking peoples temperatures before entering the hospital.... Some people were being held out side, for further screening, but that does not necessarily mean they have the virus."

There are 3 cases reported positive few days ago.
"60 new cases today in Thailand, so it is spreading."
The live tracker is showing one confirmed case in Phangan now that is hospitalised - https://covidtracker.5lab.co/en
Koh Samui is not busy. It is the quietest ever.
The Authorities have closed massage shops and gyms.

Lots of places closed down and the Chaweng strip is like a building site, the main rd through chaweng is being resurfaced!! We understand these jobs need doing but be prepared for it to be a big disappointing mess!!!

Simplistic reply is this . Covid 19 is everywhere now in every country those that said they havnt got it or numbers are low are lieing because it's just they havnt tested there people so the numbers lie thailand links to china times there case number by 10000 just look at italy and the rest that have been upfront. Do not travel anywhere stay and stay safe on travel agents and local tourism businesses would dare promote travel to any s.e.a country right now.
"Fisherman’s Village was busy this evening, all supplying hand sanitizers, lovely meal sat on the beach! Nice to see plenty of people around shopping, eating, drinking and enjoying themselves!!!"
"After seeing the vision of the walking street market ,I am appalled . Every country has been told to keep their distance at least 2 metres apart . And open crowds of less than 100 .This does not seem to be happening here . Has the Thai Government been on the TV ,well they need too. Both speaking in English and Thai. Good luck everyone , Chok Dee."
"Not to alarm everyone , but Italian doctors in Northern Italy have said they are seeing younger patients in their 30,s and 40, s so be aware you are not immune to this virus. Take care please."
"#Thailand: Thailand has announced that all travellers, including those transiting, will need a medical certificate confirming you don’t have COVID-19 and an insurance policy with at least USD100,000 of medical coverage for COVID-19. Check with your airline or the nearest Thai embassy or consulate for the latest on entry and transit requirements. See smartraveller.gov.au/Thailand"
"@PerthPatz Thailand was the first country to have coronovirus cases outside China on Jan 13, 5 weeks before Australia. Nevertheless Australia has now 7 times more COVID 19 cases than Thailand. I don't think Thailand needs lecturing how to handle this crisis from a country where people fight over toilet paper."
"Chris - this implies you believe the Thai figures. Besides, PerthPatz is right we all have a responsibility here. Even the Thai government are now saying people should stay in doors wherever possible and not travel."
There is no recommendation from the Thai government for visitors to stay indoors. It’s 33 degrees here while the optimal temperature for virus transmission is 9 degrees. Staying indoors in air conditioned rooms is probably not the best advice. I don’t necessarily believe whatever the Thai government says but I believe when the infectious disease specialist at Bangkok Hospital Samui tells me that there is not one COVID 19 case on the island.
Richard Barrow is about as trustworthy as you can get right now and he posted the stay in doors information:https:/…It doesn't matter if there are cases on Samui or not. By travelling you risk spreading the virus which puts people at risk.
It's not just about your personal risk. You have a social responsibility not to pass this on to other people.If you are young and infected you may not even have any symptoms but you are a walking biological weapon.
"""People shouldn't just look at the average mortality rate, rather they should look at the rates based on age and health conditions, THEN decide the risk to themselves.""The most important thing is to slow down the spread. Thailand cases are soaring, doubled in 2 days, 89 today. It may spread slower in hot countries. The less contacts you have the less this will spread, that's why countries have locked down and have curfews and self isolation."
"I think what was more appalling is governments insisting people return and face huge line ups at airports, in non well ventilated hall ways at airports, as seen a week or two back on a number of world news casts.Looks like the night markets are going to be non existent for a while, if a post on Facebook was correct yesterday... at least for Lamai, but I suspect all will close along with bars without restaurants. Avoid close contact and touching, as much as possible, but it's not always easy when handling money etc or around food service etc.Wash hands often!At least there is lots of toilet paper available at the supermarkets."
#220 Richard Barrow is quoting the Ministry of Interior which recommended today to stay indoor. The Ministry of Public Health is obviously in charge public health in Thailand and there is no such advice on their website.
#226 Funny that a majority of governments want people to isolate as much as possible.They must have a lot of gullible flat earthers.Fortunately we have experts like you and Not Me.
"""gather and understand facts"" I'm still waiting for you to explain the facts - or your interpretation of them - to understand your viewpoint. People shouldn't panic though. You're right in that.

"Have to agree with McBike, since thrown in with him.Research, educate yourself, as more than enough good info out there. Due your own risk assessment...for you. Go from there, but don't panic because of MSM hysteria.If high risk, older, not the best immune system, then yes, take it very seriously. Possibly isolate yourself if that concerned. Seems easy enough to do. Which if in the high risk group, should be experienced at that already.If and when, not going to happen, IMHO, it becomes more deadly, than the common seasonal flu, and if I thought it was, even I may show a wee bit more concern.Common sense, again, and do what you do normally to avoid contagions. For me, no more, no less for CV-19. Not hiding, and life goes on. What's it up to, 12k dead.

"The recommendations of the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and the WHO as of March 21:The Thailand MOPH recommends that people using public transportation clean their hands each time they leave the train, bus or taxi. Upon arriving home, people should wash their hands, shower, change cloths before interacting family members.The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including by the virus causing COVID-19, include the following:• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).Edited: 12:39 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"OK, not been following this thread, so went back a page, so see what up with the 'waiting for McBike' comment. Still not sure, but saw this:"" You have a social responsibility not to pass this on to other people.""Yes & no. I'm not going to cough in someone faces, raised better than that and keep my body fluid / droplets to myself.But I'm also not going to curtail my life and live in a bubble because someone else might get sick and die of something I may or may not, spread.If they are in a high risk group....'they' should isolate themselves.With that mindset, we should all be in isolation every seasonal flu season.....is that next.Seriously, the hysterical reaction to this 'minor' bug is laughable. 12k ish now, maybe 15 - 20k, when done or even 50k deaths, is a drop in the bucket to the millions that die every year. From diseases alone.Will the worldwide count even surpass the road deaths here ??? List of WHO precautions, well I guess, common sense for the high risk crowd.

"My Cycling, more than happy to answer your question.

Doesn't sound too cheery for sure but that is the reality of what is unfolding.I would also have posted far less if it wasn't for people like you trying to downplay what is going on.

"#257 webme, you are ""concerned about the dangers"" of coronavirus on an island with zero confirmed COVID19 cases?Your home country (UK) has 8 times more coronavirus cases per capital than Thailand and about half of the ICU beds than Thailand. Your gloomy perspective seems to be more appropriate for England."
"Reported cases you mean? Tests in Thailand show nearly 5% are positive which shows there is quite a high number, UK is about 6% but has done roughly 7x more tests than Thailand. So what do you expect? UK now has 8,000 more ICU beds as they will use private hospitals as well. Yes situation is serious but don't think it does not exist there."
"Chris, when people travel the virus spreads and people die. Samui may escape the worst of it but that doesn't mean it's exempt from what is a global problem."
"I've never treated you as an enemy. I do consider some of your posts dangerous and at odds with the facts, and that is frustrating, but I've always tried to engage in reasonable dialogue with you."
"Singray, the NHS has added 8,000 hospital beds across England, not ICU (intensive care) Beds. All of the UK has less than 4000 ICU beds. Scotland only 50 for example. Even if the NHS was able to add 1000s of ICU beds, it already admitted it simply doesn't have the staff to operated more ICU beds. There are multiple research papers which show that coronavirus transmission rates depend on temperature (9 degrees is best for virus), humidity and sunlight (the virus doesn't like sunshine). At 33 degrees and constant sunshine here, you may get imported cases but transmissions within the island are likely to be low."
"Chris, I initially didn't believe 50 beds for the whole of Scotland so I googled it and found an article stating 190 beds with a 71 percent occupancy rate, leaving only 58 available at time of publication. Terribly inadequate even at the best of times. I'm a Scot so have family there, I do hope none of them end up needing one.Also googled Australia, only 2,229 ICU beds to go around. Couldn't find our occupancy rates with a quick search but an estimate of 44,580 cases would fill them up just with CV patients."
"#267, OK I accept I misunderstood the news, yes 8,000 more beds, some of which will be IC ones, currently not given how many. It also has 20,000 extra staff, so that will no doubt help but yes it's going be a difficult time over the next month or so.Yes I agree transmission rates do appear to be lower but it is still spreading in hot climates, but look at the figures over the last week. You can also look at Italy and Spain's figures over the last month. There did not have a problem 1 month ago. Malaysia figures are rising quite quickly also if you want to look at a hot climate which actually borders Thailand. Indonesia is similar to Thailand at the moment.Edited: 9:46 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Community transmissions are happening in Thailand, maybe not on Samui but they certainly are in Bangkok. Thats why there have closed down bars and boxing matches etc."
"The numbers in some countries are grossly understated. Was just in Indonesia, I'll bet they have thousands yet only 400 reported. Their death rate is almost 10% , so likely the denominator is way off.Poor countries like Myanmar, Laos and Indonesia, people just dont go to the doctor because they cant afford it."
I'd say the numbers in most countries are vastly underestimated meaning the death rate will be much lower than currently estimated.That's no comfort though. Whatever the stats health systems are collapsing under the strain. A pattern that's repeating across more and more countries and cases are still rising exponentially.
Indonesia hardly did any testing until recently. Myanmar and Laos have no reported cases.What we should have is number of tests done in each country.
"#262, how many of those ICU beds in Thailand are private than ordinary Thais can access?"
"Of the 188 new cases today “""Most of the new cases were found in Bangkok and were among young people who continue to have social activities, which can lead to more infections, he said urging the public to stay home”. He is a public health ministry spokesman."
#272 Friday prayers continue to be held in Indonesia and most of Malaysia. Apparently a main source of transmissions in those countries. Obviously not a concern in Thailand.

You have not the question. Govt. hospitals are already crowded.
"Samui Government hospital has been less busy of late... Perhaps find a new topic to continue with this, as most posts here ^^^ has nothing to do with Samui."

I just got back from Thailand. When I was there last week there was a one case reported on Koh Phanang island biena Thail lady whom had been in contact with tourists.
Several days before it was reported about 1 Spanish girl with Coronavirus. Hotel in which she had been staying is now on quarantine. Everyone on the island are obliged to wear masks now.

There is no obligation for everyone on the island to wear masks.
"According to the study ""Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate""environmental temperatures associated with 99% of all positive COVID 19 cases worldwide has so far been between -4,01ºC to 15,58ºC :https:/…2020.03.12.20034728v1No wonder that tropical South East Asia has so few cases compared to colder parts of the world."
"Chris, a slower spread does not mean you don't have an emergency. It just buys you more time to prepare for the consequences.The same goes for social isolation. It's all about bringing the rate of infection and death down. It's not the solution.This is why you have a state of emergency in Thailand despite it being a tropical country."
"""environmental temperatures associated with 99% of all positive COVID 19 cases worldwide has so far been between -4,01ºC to 15,58ºC :""Where does it say that, can't see it in that link and many of the badly infected countries are above 15.58C now. That is quite old post 16 March, it certainly is not 99%, just been through some hotter countries and it over 5%, yes it may have been in the early days but it has changed, many parts of the USA are now over 15C."
"Surprisingly, PM did not go heavy handed with the 'decree' and even left it up to the governors to set their provincial policies.Although.....if not heeding the self quarantine asked for, would not then be surprised if a curfew issued.Playing it by ear, and hoping the numbers level off a bit, and not go crazy up country as some suspect.Wait & see, with next month, fairly shut down. If people do as asked."
"6th March there was 182,414 recorded cases now there are over 614,000. Thailand had only a few cases now it's over 1,200."
