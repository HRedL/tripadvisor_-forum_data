"Why Snarky comments? I plan to travel to Vegas from Ontario in April. However, if shows, pools etc are being shut down, those will be factors on whether or not I cancel and rebook at a later time. So I like to keep on top of the latest infoShaky, I have been using this forum as people usually share links and info with the latest updates."

"Thanks normandog,"
"FLW, You are once again correct, i will behave..."
"You can go to you tube and search ""Not Leaving Las Vegas"" This is a guy who puts out 3 or 4 videos a day on Vegas, and he has a lot of good info. He just posted on the virus, and he makes good sense. His info is not biased one way or the other."
"Normandog, thanks so much, that is exactly what i was looking for..."
"i'll be using google and typing in the names of the places i'm thinking about going to see if they're open or not. not sure there's a central location for every closing, but looks like some people are giving good suggestions."
