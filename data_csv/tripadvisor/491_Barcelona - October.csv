"Hi, How realistic is it do you think to book a 4 night trip to Barca in October? How do you envisage it being for tourists? Am i being optimistic thinking i can get there in 2020?"
I would say 50%.
thank you...I'm so tempted to book cos the prices are great...but would be sad if Barca isn't at it's usual best due to Corona
"I don't think that Barca is ever worth a visit, Corona or not. (Not surprising, with a population of 103, according to Wikipedia.)Barcelona on the other hand... (You know, that city with a football club nicknamed Bar√ßa... ;-)Edited: 7:22 am, June 19, 2020 "
"Whether it's practical may also depend if the UK are telling people coming back from Spain to quarantine. You could book a cheap flight and a cancellable hotel, and just lose the cost of the flight if you can't go? I've done similar myself but for January (wouldn't like my chances of making it in October).For what it's worth, there are often good hotel deals in winter in Barcelona anyway. I've not found January prices lower than previous years, but I've not checked for October."
"I have a booking for early October and I am very hopeful of making the trip, even more because I lost a visit this May.Keep well allAnthony"
"Planning a trip back in October...waiting of any Covid-19 restrictions from non EU Countries, like the USA.."
"Any answer given to you in this forum, under the present circumstances, is pure speculation at this point.Consider that most medical authorities and experts, at least here in Europe, have already discounted that they'll be another Covid-19 wave in the Fall. What's being profusely discussed, especially at European Commission level, is whether we'll be sufficiently ready for this one in terms of detection, prevention and hospital capabilities to keep it under control.Some of the measures that might be taken include partially closing areas (neighbourhoods, cities, towns) or preventing visitors from entering the country (or entering with restrictions). This means that, in the worst scenario, you might simply encounter you can't fly in, fly out or that you need to quarantine.Should you decide to go ahead and plan a holiday anywhere outside your home country, I advise to make sure you have a cancellation insurance.Note that, at present, only citizens or legal residents of the European Schengen zone are allowed to enter the European Schengen zone. That means US visitors are not allowed (just yet). Depending on the evolution of the outbreak in the US, that prohibition might extend for many weeks.Edited: 5:56 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"Whatever you book, make sure it can be canceled and refunded. If you commit to plane tickets, understand that some airlines might not refund in cash. They might give you date changes for free or travel vouchers.Have insurance as mentioned. Also, make sure your insurance covers Covid-19."
